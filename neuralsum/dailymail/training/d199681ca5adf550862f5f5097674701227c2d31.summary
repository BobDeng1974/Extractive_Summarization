by @entity0 @entity1 : 12:56 est , 27 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:49 est , 27 december 2013 a retired company director who was forced to wait more than six hours for an ambulance died later that day in hospital			1
on the day @entity6 became seriously unwell , @entity7 was ' struggling to cope ' - and paramedics had to be called out three times before the pensioner was seen			1
the 76 - year - old had developed a severe infection and his gp had requested an ambulance to take him to hospital within four hours			1
mr @entity6 arrived at the @entity16 more than two hours later than planned and was taken straight to accident and emergency department but , when it did not arrive on time , concerned staff at mr @entity6 ’s nursing home rang 999 twice			1
an inquest into his death heard these calls actually made the situation worse because they cancelled out the original request for an ambulance and caused further delay			0
it meant that mr @entity6 , of @entity31 , @entity32 , arrived at the @entity16 more than two hours later than planned and was taken straight to accident and emergency department , where he later died			2
although the inquest heard the delay did not contribute to his death , @entity7 said it had now reviewed its policy on how it deals with separate calls to a single incident			2
@entity37 and @entity38 heard how mr @entity6 was receiving respite care at the @entity40 , in @entity41 , in november 2012			0
mr @entity6 was receiving respite care at the @entity40 , for type - two diabetes , @entity45 s disease and @entity47 's disease at the time , mr @entity6 was suffering from type - two diabetes , parkinson ’s disease and alzheimer 's disease			1
signs of a bladder infection prompted staff at the home to call an out - of - hours emergency care practitioner to take a look at him			0
the inquest heard the practitioner , @entity58 , diagnosed mr @entity6 with a urinary tract infection			2
he was put on antibiotics and care home staff were told to seek further medical help if his condition deteriorated			0
three days later , mr @entity6 ’s condition had worsened , so staff called in dr @entity66 , of the @entity67 , for another check - up and at 2.30pm the @entity13 diagnosed him with ' uncontrolled diabetes and possible urinary sepsis '			1
he said : ' it was fairly apparent he needed to be in hospital			0
' dr @entity66 returned to his surgery and at 2.50pm requested an ambulance to arrive within four hours and take mr @entity6 to the @entity16			1
he said , on reflection , he should have called for an ambulance within two hours - but the inquest heard this would have been equally difficult for @entity7 because of flooding and poor weather conditions			2
at 7.34pm care home staff rang 999 because he was concerned by the ambulance delay and said mr @entity6 had become ' very pale '			1
they were also called at 8.11pm			0
but @entity84 , service delivery manager for the emergency operations centre at @entity7 , told the inquest how the original request for an ambulance was effectively cancelled and replaced by the new request			0
an ambulance eventually arrived at the care home at 9.27pm and reached the hospital at 10.28pm			0
ms @entity84 said @entity7 ’s policies had now been reviewed to avoid this issue arising again			0
assistant coroner @entity95 , recording a narrative conclusion , said it was “ more likely than not ' that mr @entity6 would have died even if he had arrived at hospital on time			2
the medical cause of mr @entity6 ’s death was given as diabetic ketoacidosis - a condition caused by high blood glucose levels due to a bladder infection			1
after the inquest , a spokesman for @entity7 apologised to mr @entity6 ’s family and said : ' we have reviewed our policies to make sure this does not happen again			1
' mr @entity6 ’s family said they wanted to thank the ambulance service for ' putting their hands up ' over the incident .			0
