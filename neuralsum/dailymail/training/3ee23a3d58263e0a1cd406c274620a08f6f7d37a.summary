@entity0 has long been a favorite among grown - up fashionistas , and now he is set to try his hand at a whole new category - children 's clothing			1
the @entity7 designer , 81 , has partnered with @entity9 's @entity8 to create a line of rock ' n ' roll - inspired childrenswear , featuring apparel and accessories for boys and girls aged zero to 16 years old			1
no doubt the designs will have been approved by @entity18 , @entity0 's adorable five - year - old godson and muse who frequently walks the catwalk in his high - fashion shows			1
@entity0 ( pictured on friday at @entity22 with godson @entity18 , five ) is launching a line of childrenswear in spring 2016 a sketch of the future collection depicts two boys - one decked out in a suit reminiscent of @entity0 's signature look , and the other wearing a white and red t - shirt emblazoned with the word ' @entity0 ' the children 's collection will be unveiled in spring 2016 , with two seasonal collections released each year thereafter and prices reportedly averaging £ 17			1

pier @entity43 , president and chief executive officer of @entity0 , said in a release that the @entity47 collection ' presents a unique opportunity to share our cool , ironic , iconic dna with a wider @entity0 audience			2
' calling the venture a ' natural fit ' , he added : ' the announcement reflects the brand 's ongoing commitment to newness and will allow @entity0 to share its ironic , playful , creative vision with a young audience			0
' @entity0 regularly features his godson @entity60 ( middle , with @entity62 in january 2014 ) , the son of model @entity63 , in his shows this may be @entity0 's first foray into children 's - wear , but it 's a move that makes sense , seeing as he regularly features his godson @entity60 , son of model @entity63 , in his shows			1
@entity60 made his runway debut in the @entity73 spring / summer 2011 show , and he 's racked up quite the portfolio since			2
the photogenic youngster has graced the pages of @entity7 vogue , been photographed by his godfather - whom he calls ' @entity0 ' - multiple times , and last october was chosen to model in a @entity73 campaign alongside @entity81			0
he held hands with @entity62 while his godfather took a bow at the @entity73 spring / summer 2014 couture show in @entity85 , and he has starred in a @entity87 campaign with supermodel @entity88			0
before @entity60 , his father @entity89 ( pictured with @entity60 at the @entity90 in @entity85 ) was @entity0 's longtime muse , having first met the designer on a shoot in 2003 before @entity60 , his father @entity89 was @entity0 's longtime muse , having met the designer on a shoot in 2003			0
@entity0 , who does not have any children of his own , even made a four - volume book of photos , @entity99 , devoted entirely to @entity89			0
but now , it appears 35 - year - old @entity89 has been replaced by his son , and with @entity60 's impressive track record , it will come as no surprise if he is chosen to model the new collection when it launches next year .			2

@entity106 , 81 , releasing children 's line in spring 2016 for children up to 16
there *'ll* be two @entity47 collections a year , at £ 17 per piece
*thought* to be inspired by his godson @entity18 , five
