experts have called for a ' turbocharged ' campaign to rid the world of tobacco by 2040 leading experts have called for a ' turbocharged ' global campaign to make the world tobacco free by 2040			1
the sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years , leading public health researchers have today said			1
they claim one billion deaths from smoking could be averted by the end of the century , if action is taken now			1
but a global campaign will only work with the support of governments as well as with stronger evidence - based action against the tobacco industry , they warn			1
professors @entity23 and @entity25 , from the @entity26 in @entity27 have called on the @entity28 to lead efforts against the sale and consumption of tobacco			1
they warn that despite the decline of smoking in the developed world , tobacco use is expected to increase in some countries over the next decade , notably in @entity39 and the @entity40			1
with global population rising , there could still be more than a billion people smoking in 2025 unless urgent action is taken , it is claimed			2
the call to arms in the fight against smoking comes in a series of articles published in the @entity53 medical journal and will be launched at the @entity54 being held in @entity55 , @entity56			0
professor @entity23 , said : ' the time has come for the world to acknowledge the unacceptability of the damage being done by the tobacco industry and work towards a world essentially free from the legal and illegal sale of tobacco products			1
' a world where tobacco is out of sight , out of mind , and out of fashion - yet not prohibited - is achievable in less than three decades from now , but only with full commitment from governments , international agencies , such as @entity28 and @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , and civil society			1
' global tobacco regulation should be ' turbocharged ' , with the @entity28 taking a leading role in efforts to eliminate the sale and use of tobacco			1
the experts pointed out that falling demand for tobacco in rich parts of the world had caused the ' big four ' tobacco companies to turn their attention to low and middle - income countries			1
their alleged tactics included industrial litigation , lobbying through third - party groups , and covert maintenance of political pressure disguised as ' corporate social responsibility '			0
professor @entity97 , another of the authors from the @entity99 , said : ' contrary to industry claims , tobacco marketing deliberately targets women and young people			2
' the tobacco industry continues to interfere with governments ' efforts to implement effective tobacco control policies			2
' if the world is to become tobacco free , it 's vital that the industry 's appalling conduct receives far closer scrutiny and countries which stand up to the industry 's bullying tactics receive better global support			2
' a decade on from the @entity74 's landmark introduction of the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) , just 15 per cent of the world 's population have adequate access to smoking cessation services			0
moreover , less than one in 10 people across the world are covered by tobacco taxation at levels recommended by the @entity119			2
the experts led by professors @entity23 and @entity25 , from the @entity26 in @entity27 , said the sale of tobacco should be phased out within the next 25 years that is despite research showing that increasing the cost of tobacco to consumers through taxation is one of the most effective ways to reduce consumption			1
in the last 10 years 50 million people have died as a result of tobacco use , indicating the @entity119 alone is insufficient to achieve substantive reductions in the use of tobacco			1
while the implementation of the @entity119 has been successful in some countries , particularly in @entity148 , @entity27 , @entity149 , the @entity150 and some @entity152 island countries , global action must now be taken			0
the authors note this can be achieved by accelerating the @entity119 in those countries slow on the uptake			0
they said up until now too much focus has been on reducing the demand for tobacco			2
for further progress to be made , however , attention must turn to the supply , with greater regulation and closer scrutiny of the tobacco industry			0
@entity166 , chief executive of the charity @entity167 ( @entity167 ) said : ' along with many other rich nations , we have made good progress in reducing tobacco use over the past several decades			0
' however , one in five @entity150 adults continue to smoke , not through choice but because they are addicted			0
' and 100,000 die early each year as a result			0
' the authors of the @entity53 articles are right that we need to do more to tackle the tobacco industry and to make it pay for the damage it does			0
' this is just what the tobacco levy currently being consulted on by @entity185 could achieve			0
' but it is essential that the money raised should be used to encourage smokers to quit and to discourage young people from taking up this deadly habit			0

sale of tobacco should be phased out in the next 25 years , experts say
claim one billion deaths could be averted by the end of the century
@entity28 should take a lead role in the ' turbocharged ' campaign
