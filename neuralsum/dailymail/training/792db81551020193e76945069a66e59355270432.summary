by @entity0 published : 11:17 est , 29 january 2014 updated : 12:06 est , 29 january 2014 whether matte , leather look or in a delicate pastel hue , nailpolish is rapidly becoming a cheap and chic way to score style points			0
but although its tempting to change your colour as often as you change your clothes , overdoing the lacquer can have disastrous consequences , as one @entity14 mother discovered			2
two decades of repeatedly changing her polish left mother - of - two @entity18 , 31 , with unsightly yellowed , crumbling nails and , worse , without any at all on three toes			1
ruined : @entity18 's toenails have been destroyed by her penchant for changing her polish every day embarrassing : @entity18 says she is too young to have crumbling toenails as a result , the stay - at - home mother is unable to wear open - toed shoes , while the painful exposed skin on three of her toes mean heels are also out of the question			1
' it might seem like a little thing but to me it 's a big thing , ' she explained , adding : ' it really gets me down			0
' her problems began two years ago , when she began to notice a dryness and yellowing			2
' they just started to go really weak and crumble off , ' she adds			0
a polish habit that had lasted for two decades was to blame , made worse by her insistence on removing and replacing the varnish almost every day			1
from a very young age , i 've been painting my toenails and i 've been using nailpolish remover on them			1
' @entity49 remover can cause problems because it contains a chemical called acetone which saps the moisture from the nails , ' explains leading dermatologist , dr @entity55			2
' it leaves them weak , brittle and dry and with this sort of flaking , crumbling problem			2
' at first @entity18 attempted to combat the damage alone			1
' they were going very yellow and very weak , ' she explains			0
' i stopped painting them for a while but when i started again , they began to crumble off			0
' unable to solve the problem , she went to the doctors and asked to have the worst - affected toenails removed			1
' they had a sort of plier thing to remove the nails with , ' she remembers			0
' i was really happy because i thought they would grow back baby - fresh , brand new ... ' solution : @entity18 has to use false toenails when she wants to wear open - toed sandals ( right ) @entity78 made : @entity18 's false toenails have been made especially for her but only stay on for a week when , a year after having the toenails removed , she returned to the doctor to find out why they were n't growing back , she had an unpleasant surprise in store			1
' she said they 're never growing back , ' says @entity18			1
' i said " no one told me they would n't grow back " and i was totally devastated and it looks disgusting			1
getting my nails removed , that 's my biggest regret			0
' despite trying everything from false nails to painting polish directly onto the nailbed , @entity18 is yet to find a solution and complains that finding footwear is impossible			1
her lack of toenails has also had a huge impact on her confidence			0
' i 've seen people in their 60s , 70s and 80s with lovely nails , ' she adds			0
' i 'm too young to have no toenails			0
' but she has no choice			0
according to @entity110 , her nails will never grow back so the only option is custom made prosthetic nails			0
for @entity18 , the cost of pretty toenails has proved heavier than she could ever have imagined			1
@entity18 appears on @entity116 , thursday at 8pm on @entity117			2

mother - of - two @entity18 , 31 , changed her polish daily for 20 years

three were so bad , they had to be removed but have n't grown back
has to wear closed - toe flats because heels are now too painful
