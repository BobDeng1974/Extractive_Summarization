by @entity1 reporter published : 09:08 est , 3 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:12 est , 3 december 2013 @entity5 ’s plan to let self - guided drones deliver packages has run in to regulatory turbulence			1
@entity9 , the ceo of the online giant , is working on a way to use small aircraft to get parcels to customers in 30 minutes or less			1
while flight technology makes it feasible , @entity16 law and society 's attitude toward drones have n't caught up with @entity9 ' vision			1
the company says it 's working on the so - called @entity25 unmanned aircraft project but it will take years to advance the technology and for the @entity27 to create the necessary rules and regulations			1
@entity5 's ceo @entity9 says that he wants to use octocoptors ( pictured ) to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes - and now has plans to begin sending orders before customers even click buy the project was first reported by @entity39 ' ' @entity38 ' sunday night , where @entity9 said that while his octocopters look like something out of science fiction , there 's no reason they ca n't be used as delivery vehicles			1
@entity9 said the drones can carry packages that weigh up to five pounds , which covers about 86 per cent of the items @entity5 delivers			1
the drones the company is testing have a range of about 10 miles , which @entity9 noted could cover a significant portion of the population in urban areas			1
@entity9 told ' @entity38 ' the project could become a working service in four or five years			1
unlike the drones used by the military , @entity9 ' proposed flying machines wo n't need humans to control them remotely			1
@entity5 's drones would receive a set of gps coordinates and automatically fly to them , presumably avoiding buildings , power lines and other obstacles			1
delivery drones raise a host of concerns , from air traffic safety to homeland security and privacy			2
there are technological and legal obstacles , too — similar to @entity79 's experimental driverless car			2
how do you design a machine that safely navigates the roads or skies without hitting anything ? and , if an accident occurs , who 's legally liable ? delivering packages by drone might be impossible in a city like @entity90 which has many no - fly zones			2
to the door : the drones will be programmed with the specific gps coordinates of an address most items : 86 per cent of the shipments made by @entity5 way less than five pounds , which is the amount of weight that the drones would be able to carry ' it 's fascinating as an idea and probably very hard to execute , ' says @entity103 , an analyst with @entity104 who sees @entity9 as an unconventional thinker			1
' if he could really deliver something you order within 30 minutes , he would rewrite the rules of online retail			0
' @entity5 spends heavily on growing its business , improving order fulfillment and expanding into new areas			2
those investments have come at the expense of consistent profitability , but investors have been largely forgiving , focusing on the company 's long - term promise and double - digit revenue growth			2
headed to @entity90 : @entity16 law forbid the commercial use of unmanned drones so negotiations with the @entity27 will be important to allow the @entity5 initiative to be permitted the company spent almost $ 2.9billion in shipping last year , accounting for 4.7 per cent of its net sales			1
there is no prohibition on flying drones for recreational use , but since 2007 , the @entity27 has said they ca n't be used for commercial purposes			2
' the technology has moved forward faster than the law has kept pace , ' says @entity137 , special counsel at the law firm @entity138			0
@entity137 is currently challenging that regulation before a federal administrative law judge on behalf of a client who was using a radio - controlled aircraft to shoot video for an advertising agency			0
autonomous flights like @entity5 is proposing , without somebody at the controls , are also prohibited			2
the @entity27 is slowly moving forward with guidelines on commercial drone use			2
last year , @entity150 directed the agency to grant drones access to @entity16 skies by september 2015 , but the agency already has missed several key deadlines and said the process would take longer than @entity150 expected			0
the @entity27 plans to propose rules next year that could allow limited use of drones weighing up to 55 pounds , but those rules are also expected to include major restrictions on where drones can fly , posing significant limits on what @entity5 could do			1
many of the commercial advances in drone use have come out of @entity169 , @entity170 , and @entity171			0
in @entity170 , for instance , an electric company is using drones to check on remote power lines			0
' the delay has really been to the disadvantage of companies here , ' @entity137 says			0
' generally , the government wants to promote the advancement of science and technology			0
in this case , the government has done exactly the opposite and thwarted the ability of small , startup companies to develop commercial applications for this revolutionary technology			0
' man with a plan : @entity5 ceo @entity9 unveiled the controversial drones during an interview with 60 minutes @entity5 is n't the only company awaiting guidelines			1
a @entity199 's franchise in the @entity200 released a test flight video in june of the ' @entity202 , ' a drone used to deliver hot pizza			0
the @entity27 said monday that it is moving forward with ' regulations and standards for the safe integration of remote piloted ( drones ) to meet increased demand			1
' the agency reiterated that ' autonomous ( drone ) operation is not currently allowed in the @entity16			0
' given the slow pace at which the @entity27 typically approves regulations , @entity9 ' prediction of four or five years for approval seems unrealistic to many			1
safety concerns could be the real obstacle in delaying drones for widespread commercial use			0
' you 're putting a device with eight rapidly spinning blades into areas where people are assumed to be , ' says @entity227 , a journalism professor at the @entity228 and head of the university 's @entity230 ' the threat to people on the ground is significant			2
' according to @entity5 's website , the goal of the new delivery system is to get packages into customers ' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles it 's not hard to imagine that the world 's biggest online retailer has some significant lobbying muscle and might be able to persuade the @entity27 to alter the rules			1
@entity5 spokeswoman @entity247 says the company has been in contact with the @entity27 ' as they are actively working on necessary regulation			1
' one of the biggest promises for civilian drone use is in agriculture because of the industry 's largely unpopulated , wide open spaces			0
delivering @entity5 packages in @entity257 will be much trickier			2
but the savings of such a delivery system only come in large , urban areas			0
besides regulatory approval , @entity5 's biggest challenge will be to develop a collision avoidance system , says @entity264 , a consultant who gave up on the commercial airline industry and now focuses on drones			1
who is to blame , @entity264 asked , if the drone hits a bird , crashes into a building ? who is going to insure the deliveries ? there are also technical questions			0
who will recharge the drone batteries ? how many deliveries can the machines make before needing service ? spanning the country : the drones are being tested over a 10 - mile radius at the moment but @entity9 says that will work for most urban areas ' @entity9 might be the single person in the universe who could make something like this happen , ' @entity264 says			1
' for what it worth , this is a guy who 's totally changed retailing			0
' if @entity5 gets its way , others might follow			0
@entity298 executives heard a presentation from a drone vendor earlier this year , says @entity301 , @entity303 ' chief sales , marketing and strategy officer			0
' commercial use of drones is an interesting technology , and we 're certainly going to continue to evaluate it , ' @entity301 says			0
the @entity311 and @entity312 would n't speculate about using drones for delivery .			0

@entity5 ceo @entity9 has *announced* the online retailer has *secretly* been testing drones that will delivery packages directly to people 's doors
project is at least five years from reality *due* to still - to - be - determined @entity27 regulations
legal questions about who would be *responsible* if the drones crashed are causing concern since they could *injure* people on the ground
