@entity0 praised his team 's performance against @entity3 , despite @entity4 slipping to their second consecutive defeat			1
although they dominated the match , @entity4 were unable to find the net , and @entity9 's goal was enough to earn the visitors all three points			1
but @entity0 said his side were simply unlucky to come up against a goalkeeper in fine form , and would bounce back after the international break			1
' unfortunately , football is a capricious sport that only rewards the team who scores goals , i mean the team that is effective and today we have n't done that			2
' @entity3 's goalkeeper has done amazing and today it was n't our day and we had this scoreline			1
' moreover it happens in an ' friendly ' week , in an interesting week and in a week where the time of criticism starts			0
' but it is our responsibility to stand up , all of us , the stuff , the managers , the players , the club			0
we have to move forward			0
' @entity49 , who made his home debut , has now lost both of his competitive games for his new club the defeat came against @entity0 's former club , so he can have no excuses for being surprised by their quality			1
' i already knew the opponent 's predisposition so i was expecting a game like this , ' he added			2
' i 'd rather like to control it better in more aspects			0
' however , i think @entity3 tried to create lots [ of ] chances , but not that many , two of them were pretty clear and the last one was due to our last minute pressing			2
' they are a very difficult team to play against , but despite this we have created 19 shots , nine on goal , four hit the posts			0
so , even if we have had some mistakes and things to rectify i want to point out some values , mainly the players ' faith and their attitude			0
' @entity82 curses his luck as @entity4 hit the woodwork a remarkable four times during the frustrating defeat @entity49 looks unable to comprehend the defeat , which leaves @entity4 third in the @entity91 table			1

@entity4 lost second @entity91 game in a *row* at home to @entity3
@entity0 *insists* his side 's performance was positive despite defeat
@entity4 slip to third in the table after 1 *-* 0 defeat
