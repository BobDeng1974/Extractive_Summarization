waking up with a giant spot on your face prior to an important event is a scenario most women know only too well , but how far would you go to get rid of it ? you may have tried tea tree oil and serums that claim to zap it away in an instant but , failing those , would you dare dab your own urine on your face in a desperate attempt to banish the pesky zit ? one author claims that applying urine to your visage can be extremely effective when it comes to treating troublesome skin			1
she explains that urine therapy - or urotherapy - has historical roots in ancient @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38			1
essentially , she claims that thanks to its anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties , urine helps boost immunity to disease			1
@entity31 says that the enzyme , vitamin and mineral - rich liquid should be applied topically to the skin to help with acne , eczema , psoriasis and fungal infections			1
@entity31 goes as far as to suggest that drinking your own urine will boost your health immensely the nutritional and natural healthcare consultant , who also works as a medical research writer , goes as far as to suggest that drinking your own urine will boost your health immensely			1
she refers to @entity60 , who fasted on his own urine and water for 45 days , and recommends massaging yourself with urine and even using it as an eye and ear drop			2
urine baths , she says , are beneficial and refers to the women who took urine baths in eighteenth century @entity71			1
indeed , pop star @entity72 once claimed to swear by the gross ritual			1
speaking on the @entity75 show , she said : ' peeing in the shower is really good , it , it fights athlete 's foot			1
' i 'm serious , urine is like an antiseptic , it 's all got to do with the enzymes in your body			1
' ultimately , @entity31 argues that urine is n't promoted by the healthcare world because it 's free			1
writing for @entity88 , @entity87 claims that putting urine in your face cream is the latest @entity93 health trend			2
she explains that her friend was advised to apply it topically by the local while living in @entity97 , @entity38			0
' they initially encouraged us to mix some of our urine in with whatever moisturiser we ’d brought with us			2
i just put some in my @entity104			0
my skin was so , so soft , ' she writes			2
@entity108 , nutritionist at @entity109 , said : ' @entity110 typically contains breakdown products from a wide range of foods , drinks , drugs , environmental contaminants , beauty products and waste metabolites of the body			0
' for this reason , the actual content of each individuals urine is totally different			2
on the whole though , it is approximately 95 per cent water and then 5 per cent nutrients such as calcium , iron , magnesium and zinc			0
' there is no research to show any other benefits than just the 5 per cent nutrients			0
there has to be a simpler way of getting any benefits of urine that are claimed			2
i would suggest a glass of water and either a healthy meal or a multi vitamin and mineral tablet - the benefits will far exceed a glass of urine			1
' overall – not something i would recommend ! ’ urine therapy is said to date back to the @entity150			0
historical documents suggest that the @entity152 disinfected wounds with it , while the benefits are also mentioned in @entity38 and @entity37 literature			0
urine is highly sterile , consisting of 95 per cent water and five per cent nutrients such as proteins , vitamins and minerals			0
during the digestive process , the liver deals with toxins and removes them to be excreted			0
the blood then goes to the kidneys where it is filtered again and extraneous components the body no longer needs are collected in a sterile solution which is then passed as urine			0
but gp dr @entity175 said : ' over the years many people have claimed health benefits from drinking their own urine , but as far as i 'm aware there is no scientific evidence to back - up these claims			1
' the kidneys are an efficient filtering system getting rid of what the body does n't need , so to put this back into the body seems counter-productive			0
' personally , i believe there are better - and more palatable - ways to keep the body healthy including not smoking , eating a healthy diet , and keeping stress under control			0
