by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 11:18 est , 26 december 2012 @entity3 : 07:06 est , 27 december 2012 @entity4 , the sister of @entity6 founder @entity5 , has complained that her privacy was breached on the social networking site when one of her photos was taken and shared on @entity11			1
@entity4 posted a picture of her family jokingly reacting to @entity6 's new @entity15 application , and someone tweeted the picture out to the public			1
incident comes as @entity6 has long been accused of taking advantage of user 's privacy concerns , so the fact that one of their own family members felt the sting of an open social network comes as a late @entity29 present to the company 's critics			1
in the photo , @entity4 's younger siblings and parents are seen in what appears to be their family home in @entity38 , @entity39			1
breach : @entity4 posted a photo of her siblings joking in their family kitchen on christmas day , and she thought that since she was sharing it with only friends it would not be published @entity5 is standing in the corner - wearing his trademark hoodie sweatshirt and a bit of a smirk - while the other @entity48 looks aghast at their cell phones , presumably mocking the latest update to the social networking application			1
the new version of ' pokes ' allow users to send fleeting messages , pokes , photos and 10 - second videos to friends			0
the messages expire after a set period of time , from 1 to 10 seconds , and can not be retrieved by either party again , making it perfect for sending salacious images without leaving a trail			0
@entity4 might have wanted to employ a similar self - destructing device for this photo , since she is now furious that it has been made public			2
backtracking : @entity68 saw the photo because she is @entity6 friends with @entity4 's younger sister @entity71 who was tagged in the photo a journalist and recent college graduate named @entity68 saw the photo in her newsfeed because she is a friend of @entity4 and @entity5 's sister @entity71 - who was tagged in the picture - and decided to share the personal moment with her own 39,642 followers			1
' not sure where you got this photo			0
i posted it to friends only on @entity6			1
you reposting it to @entity11 is way uncool , ' @entity4 told @entity68 in a public exchange on the microblogging site			0
she quickly deleted original tweet with the photo but other sites like @entity93 quickly got a screengrab , and the @entity11 account for hacker group @entity95 sent out that link			0
@entity68 responded back to @entity4 saying that her reaction was ' totally fair			2
i would hate for a private photo of mine to be public and would never want to do the same for others			0
' ' ( for what it 's worth ) , i thought the photo was incredibly endearing which is why i liked it			2
we never see humans on the internet ! siblings : @entity4 ( right ) worked for her brother @entity5 ( left ) since @entity6 started but she recently left to begin her own tech venture and executive produce a @entity113 show about @entity114 ' i 'm completely sensitive to privacy			1
i loved the photo bc it seemed so fun and normal			0
you should make it public ! ; ) ' in spite of @entity68 's grovelling , @entity4 , who is now promoting a new show on @entity113 about the allegedly glamorous world of tech start - ups in @entity114 , used the opportunity to make it a teaching moment			2
' @entity129 etiquette : always ask permission before posting a friend 's photo publicly			0
it 's not about privacy settings , it 's about human decency , ' she wrote via @entity11			0
@entity6 first coined ' poking ' as a way to get your friend 's attention on their site , similar in style to ' liking ' their updated status or a new picture			2
now it is an entirely different beast			0
' with the @entity15 app , you can poke or send a message , photo , or video to @entity6 friends to share what you 're up to in a lightweight way , ' said the site in a blog post announcing the new app. the new version of pokes are similar to @entity161 , an app which is popular with younger age users , and which has gained a reputation as a tool for sending risque images .			1

@entity4 posted of the family looking aghast at their *smartphones* in their parent 's kitchen on @entity29
photo was a joke about the *negative* reaction to @entity6 's new ' poke ' app
thought it would not get published because she allowed only her friends to see the picture on her @entity6 *profile*
