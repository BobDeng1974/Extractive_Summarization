by @entity0 @entity1 said that meeting her idol gave her a new found confidence after the death of her husband the day that changed my life was 3 july 1986 , when i went to see @entity10 actress and singer @entity9 at @entity13 's @entity12			1
for anyone who does n't know her work , @entity9 is a huge star in @entity10 and a @entity17 winner			1
last year president @entity18 made her a @entity19 , a distinction she shares with the likes of @entity22 and @entity23			1
i 'd seen her on tv and thought she was amazing , but going to her show that night changed my life in so many ways			1
i became an obsessed fan and followed her around for the next 11 years until i finally got to meet her			1
any time she was in @entity30 i went to see her , and i was so inspired by her singing that i began taking lessons			2
she influenced my lifestyle too			2
after my husband died i 'd been a bit nervous about travelling on my own , but because i wanted to see @entity9 perform i started to fly to @entity36			1
then , in 1997 , my lovely friend @entity37 , best known as @entity38 on @entity39 , invited me to @entity42 ' @entity41 birthday party at the @entity43 in @entity13			2
i could n't refuse when she told me @entity9 would be performing her cabaret act ! at last i was introduced to @entity9 and got to know her			2
the following year i saw her again at the @entity12 , and she invited me to @entity36 to see her perform at the @entity45 and join in the wonderful party afterwards			2
what a glorious trip that was , and @entity9 and i have been great friends ever since			1
she sends presents to my grandchildren and i now go to @entity36 most years to see her			0
through @entity9 i 've met the most amazing people			0
for example , one @entity52 i was invited to her apartment in @entity36 for a dinner party , and she said , ' i 've placed you next to @entity57 , because i thought you 'd like that			0
' i said , ' oh lovely , @entity57 who ? ' and she replied , ' @entity60 , of course ! ' can you imagine how thrilled i was ! after meeting , @entity1 and @entity62 became lifelong friends @entity9 and i also went to @entity65 together one year - we went to the opera and wandered round the city linking arms while @entity9 told me all about working on @entity70 with @entity71 and @entity72 , and honestly i just thought i 'd died and gone to heaven			1
and another thing - where i live now is a direct result of knowing @entity9			0
the photographer @entity76 , who took all her photographs , became a friend too , and when i was looking for a flat in @entity13 he said , ' there 's one going in the block next to me			0
' the singing lessons i took when i was a fan , but not yet a friend , have also changed my life			0
i now do my own cabaret act , singing and telling stories about my life			0
@entity9 gave me some good advice when i started , and a high point for me was singing @entity90 with her on stage at the @entity92 when she came over to do a charity event a few years ago			0
so seeing @entity9 on stage all those years ago really was absolutely life - changing			0
happily she loves @entity95 in @entity96 and ca n't wait for the second series to be televised in the @entity98 in june			0
@entity1 sings at the @entity99 on 19 may			1

after the death of her husband @entity1 lost confidence in travelling alone
meeting @entity10 singer @entity62 *regained* her confidence in going *overseas*
she and @entity62 have *remained* friends since meeting
