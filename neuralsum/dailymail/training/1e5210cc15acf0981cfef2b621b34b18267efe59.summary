these rusted and decaying railway tracks may seem like any of the thousands of feet of disused track that snake under @entity3			0
but this discreet siding , @entity6 's ' @entity5 ' - was once a vital tool in the arsenal of wartime president @entity9 - and could yet spring into action again			1
hidden underneath the opulent @entity13 hotel , the secluded platform was one of many ways @entity9 , stricken by polio and paralyzed from the waist down since 1921 , would hide his affliction			1
the exact location is kept a secret by the @entity33 secret : @entity9 , pictured above on presidential trains , was rarely pictured in a way that made his disability evident			1
above , he is shown standing , but is supporting himself by holding on to railings when visiting @entity40 , often from his childhood home in @entity42 , @entity43 , the siding would allow him to make it to the @entity13 's presidential suite without attracting public attention			2
his private railway car - at that point still the luxury travel option of choice - was able to pull inside the station , at which point his limousine could drive straight off the carriage into an elevator connected directly to the hotel			1
from here he could make it into his room where nobody could see him - particularly journalists who may have tried to break the veil of silence around his condition by taking pictures			0
though the media generally agreed to avoid mentioning @entity9 's paralysis out of choice , the arrangement was not unbreachable			0
unfavorable outlets would on occasion draw attention to his illness , or publish pictures , much to the frustration of @entity76 officials			2
escape route : according to a book about the legacy of @entity6 , the secret siding is still kept manned when the president visits the @entity13 as it is a viable escape route secret : the @entity33 does not disclose exactly where the track runs			1
an official from the authority reportedly stumbled across the @entity87 in the tunnel during a 2003 visit by @entity90 armored : @entity9 's railway car , coated with thick steel and bullet - proof glass , continues to sit in the siding and is pictured above in front of the crowds : in the above image , @entity9 addresses a crowd in the 1940s			2
@entity87 agents would smash cameras and ruin film which showed the president obviously incapable of walking photographers of the day told stories of @entity87 agents smashing their cameras or exposing film to sunlight indeed , @entity9 's heavily - armored carriage , with bullet - proof glass and solid steel walls , still remains there to this day			0
judging from the photographs , it may seem like the functionality of the platform belongs to the distant past			0
but the secluded siding is still ready to spring into action to save the president 's life , and was reportedly on alert as recently as the @entity90 administration			0
furtive : this staircase leads to an unknown part of the siding - and even photographs given access to @entity5 were not allowed down there grandeur : the opulent @entity13 , above , helped build the secret track for its highest - profile guests according to @entity135 , the author of a book on @entity6 , a visit in 2003 by the chairman of the @entity139 ended with a confrontation with @entity87 agents , who were guarding the track as a potential escape route			1
in remarks from @entity6 : how a @entity146 transformed @entity147 , reported by @entity148 last year , chairman @entity145 described the surprising encounter , which came as @entity90 visited the @entity13 before addressing the @entity150			1
he said that while exploring the tracks , ' several well - dressed , polite , but persuasively armed men in suits emerged from the underground shadows and stopped him			0
' when an aide pointed out ' it 's his railroad ' , the agent simply responded ' not today '			0
the book also reports that whenever a president stays in the @entity13 , a fully - manned diesel train also waits underneath in case he needs to escape an attack .			2

' @entity5 ' was built *alongside* @entity6 for *vip* guests to the @entity13
siding allows trains to pull up and guest to get elevator directly into hotel
president @entity9 used the siding to hide his disability
@entity176 and @entity76 worked to conceal fact he could *n't* walk
privacy of @entity5 let him access @entity180 without being seen
according to account from @entity33 officials , siding is still viable escape route
