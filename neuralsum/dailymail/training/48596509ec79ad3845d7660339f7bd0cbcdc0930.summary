sen. @entity0 of @entity1 easily won election by fellow @entity3 on thursday to become @entity5 majority leader when the new @entity6 convenes in january , fulfilling a long - held ambition			1
as majority leader , @entity8 will set the @entity5 's agenda			1
along with @entity12 speaker @entity11 , who was reelected to the top spot in the @entity12 today , @entity8 will decide what legislation is sent to the @entity12 in the final two years of president @entity17 's term			1
also reelected to his party 's leadership today was current senate majority leader @entity21 , who will slide into the minority leader position at the beginning of next year			1
he currently serves as minority leader , but he 'll take the top spot in january when the next legislative session begins @entity8 , 72 , was chosen by acclamation at a closed - door meeting of the rank and file this morning			1
the @entity1 lawmaker was elected to a sixth @entity5 term last week in off - year elections in which @entity3 gained a majority for the first time in eight years			1
he will formally assume his duties as majority leader in january			1
@entity43 have assailed him in recent campaigns as a guardian of gridlock for his opposition to nearly all of president @entity17 's initiatives			2
@entity5 @entity3 had only one contested leadership race , and that was for chairman of the @entity52			1
current chairman , @entity53 of @entity54 , was not interested in retaining the position			0
in the end , republicans selected sen. @entity58 of @entity59 to chair the party 's campaign committee for the 2016 elections			1
he defeated sen. @entity64 of @entity65			0
@entity58 said at a press conference afterward that it was always a ' race between friends ' and ' a contest decided among friends , ' and the two men began and ended the election process that way			0
a relatively unknown lawmaker , it will now become @entity58 's duty to help republicans retain the @entity5 beyond their current two - year mandate			1
@entity3 members of the @entity5 also reelected @entity81 sen. @entity80 to the party 's whip spot , @entity85 sen. @entity84 as chairman of the policy committee , @entity89 sen. @entity88 to @entity3 conference chairman and @entity92 sen. @entity91 to vice chair of the @entity94			1
@entity8 , center , walks with members of the @entity3 @entity5 leadership for the 114th @entity6 on @entity98 in @entity99 today			1
with @entity8 from left are senators @entity84 of @entity85 , @entity91 of @entity92 , @entity80 of @entity81 and @entity88 of @entity89 while the voting sessions were celebratory occasions for @entity3 , they were the exact opposite for @entity43 , who took a pounding in the nov. 4 midterm elections			2
after eight years in the minority , @entity5 @entity3 picked up at least eight seats from @entity43 and are still hoping for a ninth in a @entity112 runoff set for dec. 6			1
the party also padded its majority in the @entity12 , where a handful of races remain unresolved			2
@entity3 are on track to equal or eclipse the 246 they won in 1946 , a figure that stands as a @entity119 high			2
despite sizable election losses , @entity43 appeared ready to hand their own leaders another two years at the helm on thursday , postponing a generational change that appears not far in the future			2
sen. @entity21 of @entity65 , a few weeks shy of his 75th birthday , was selected as the minority leader in the new @entity6 , but members of the rank and file made it known they were unhappy with his leadership in the last election cycle			1
first elected as @entity134 leader in 2004 , at least two senators , @entity136 of @entity92 and @entity137 of @entity138 wanted to see a change in management and asked for the leadership vote to be delayed by a week			2
but the vote was held any way , and so they refused to vote for @entity21 in order to send a message to their colleagues			0
' we ’ve got to stick to our knitting and make sure that we ’re talking about things that we want to do for the @entity153 people instead of talking about winning elections , ' @entity136 told reporters after the meeting , according to the @entity157			0
' that means making this place functional again and working with our @entity3 colleagues			0
' the end result of the three and a half - hour meeting was that sen. @entity163 of @entity164 , a progressive favorite , was given a seat at the leadership table in a newly created position			1
according to the @entity169 , she will become an adviser to the @entity171 and will help shape the party 's positions on issues and legislative priorities			2
a source familiar with the discussions told the news publication that @entity179 will also serve as a liason to progressive groups			0
also added to leadership was @entity184 sen. @entity183 , who will becme the @entity186 and @entity187 chairwoman			0
sen. @entity188 , a second - term moderate from @entity189 , was selected to head of the party 's @entity191 for 2016			2
' we ’re going to expand our leadership , we ’re going to do things a little differently , a little different approach , ' @entity21 said when he emerged from the closed - door meeting			0
remaining at the top of the party 's pecking order are @entity202 sen. @entity201 , the assistant @entity134 leader , @entity203 sen. @entity201 , vice chair of the @entity134 conference and chair of the @entity134 policy committee , @entity99 sen. @entity207 , secretary of the @entity209 and @entity211 sen. @entity210 , vice chair of the policy committee			1
hard knock : senate majority leader @entity21 was selected by his colleagues to lead the party again next year , but because of last tuesday 's midterm election losses he will be demoted to minority leader of the @entity5 in the new @entity6 leading progressive voice @entity163 of @entity164 was added to her party 's leadership slate today			1
the @entity164 senator will serve as an adviser to their policy committee and a liaison to progressives at the same time , rep. @entity229 of @entity230 , 74 , is expected to be elected to a new term as @entity201 when the rank - and - file meets next week			0
she first won her post a dozen years ago			0
@entity229 was speaker for four years when @entity43 held the majority , and has served as minority leader for eight			1
she said during a press conference today that she would not step aside as her party 's leader despite the recent losses and finds it sexist that reporters would even ask her about it when they made no such overtures to the men who lead the @entity3 when they were on the losing side			1
@entity12 @entity3 held their leadership elections today , and as expected , no major shake - ups occurred			1
the speaker 's gavel stayed with @entity11 of @entity250 , and @entity251 of @entity230 will remain the party 's majority leader , a position he won this summer after the previous holder , former rep. @entity252 , lost his primary election and subsequently left @entity6 before the end of his term			1
when @entity251 moved up in leadership , @entity112 rep. @entity259 took his position as the party 's whip , a job he was reelected today today			1
the @entity267 's campaign committee chair , @entity268 of @entity269 , and conference chair , @entity271 of @entity99 , were also reelected			0
the only change to leadership was the replacement of @entity276 rep. @entity275 as policy committee chair			0
senator - elect @entity279 will be succeeded by first - term @entity282 rep. @entity281			0
speaker of the house @entity11 , center , holds news conference with the newly - elected members of the @entity12 @entity3 leadership team			1
from left they are : rep. @entity290 , rep. @entity291 , rep. @entity281 , rep. @entity293 , rep. @entity294 , majority whip @entity259 , majority leader @entity251 , @entity295 chairman @entity268 and @entity296 chair @entity271 while none of the @entity3 leaders faced public opposition before today 's closed - door meetings , they could hand their hands full come january as they try to wrangle votes and keep the conservative wing of the @entity3 in line			1
asked about potential tension between the establishment members and the @entity309 faction in the @entity5 , @entity88 said the @entity3 's coalitions in the @entity5 understand that they have to stick together			2
' we know that in order for us to succeed we ’re going to have to function as a team and i think that gives you a renewed sense of purpose , ' @entity88 told reporters today , according to the @entity320			0
' those things tend to be more evident in the minority , but in the majority – for sure we ’re going to have disagreements			0
we have different folks who come from different places and have different views on issues , he added			0
' but when it comes to being successful in terms of trying to move an agenda i think we all recognize we have to work together as a team			0
' as for as working with @entity43 goes , @entity88 said at a press conference today , ' it 's gon na be up to them			0
the ball 's gon na be in their court			0
' the @entity89 @entity3 said that members of his party ' look forward to bipartisan cooperation ' and getting the ' peoples ' government ' working again			0
likewise , @entity91 said he was ' optimistic ' that @entity43 and @entity3 could come to an agreement on a number of issues			2
' frankly , the president 's going to engage one way or another , ' he said , turning serious			0
' he 'll either have to engage the day the bill lines up on his desk ...			0
or decide to engage earlier in a way that we might be able to do hard things together , ' @entity91 argued			0
the @entity3 leader said its important the @entity5 gets ' those hard things out of the way ' so it can focus on passing laws that aid private sector job creation , which leads to good take - home pay			2
acknowledging that in just two years it will be @entity3 who have 24 seats to defend in the @entity5 , @entity58 told reporters that ' winning in 2016 begins with good government and good legislation , ' and that 's how @entity3 plan to lead .			2
