they call @entity1 the greatest of all time and most of the world agrees			2
many here in @entity6 call @entity7 even greater that @entity1 because he played football with the rhythmic soul of the samba nation and personified the spirit of the beautiful game			1
they call @entity14 the phenomenon because how he ever came back on crippled legs to win one of their five @entity18 so far and thus become the leading goalscorer in the history of the these @entity22 defies mortal rationalisation			0
samba magic : @entity25 has scored four goals at this @entity27 to fire @entity6 into the last 16 finisher : following his double against @entity30 , @entity25 has 37 goals in 53 internationals for @entity6 @entity33 better than @entity1 age : 22 ( @entity35 05/02/1992 ) born : @entity36 , @entity6 position : forward clubs : @entity40 ( 2009 - 13 ) , @entity41 ( 2013 - ) international debut : august 10 , 2010 vs @entity43 international caps : 53 first international goal : august 10 , 2010 vs @entity43 international goals : 37 they do n’t know what to call @entity25			1
but what they do suspect is that they may , just may , have found @entity6 ’s successor to the legend of @entity54 do @entity55			2
if @entity25 is the next @entity1 then we are watching it happen at this @entity27			1
what makes this all the more possible – not to mention so thrilling that we hardly dare believe it – is that this young man refuses to countenance any such comparison			0
‘ @entity1 is a god , ’ he says			2
‘ i ’m a footballer			0
’ you have to love a boy - he is still only 22 - who insists on having @entity25 inscribed on the back of that imperishable yellow shirt in reverence of his father			1
no that his football playing dad ever scored a goal of genius like the first of the two he put past @entity30 to ensure that the host nation dazzle on to the last 16 of the first @entity27 played in this spiritual home of the beautiful game since 1950			1
but it speaks of respect			0
looking up : arguably only @entity1 and @entity7 now stand ahead of @entity25 in the list of @entity82 greats poise : @entity25 readies himself to score @entity6 's opening goal against @entity30 in their 4 - 1 @entity27 victory 1 ) @entity1 - 77 goals ( 92 caps ) 2 ) @entity88 goals ( 88 caps ) 3 ) @entity14 - 62 goals ( 98 caps ) 4 ) @entity91 - 55 goals ( 70 caps ) 5 ) bebeto - 39 goals ( 75 caps ) 6 ) @entity25 - 37 goals ( 53 caps ) @entity25 has already had with a former girlfriend a son , who he vows will always be central to his life , plus a tabloid affair with a glamourous tv celebrity			1
yet he remains the fresh - faced lad every @entity82 mother would love her daughter to bring home for dinner			2
yet there is a feisty edge to this personality which is reminiscent , also , of the icon whose boots he is being called upon to fill			0
@entity1 could look after himself on the pitch if put to the intimidation			2
similarly , when a @entity30 heavy gave him a gratuitous and potentially wounding shove into the cameramen and their heavy equipment , @entity25 brushed away the false hand of apology and promptly sent his assailant and his team = mates on their way home with another defeat			1
we will come to recall many moments when @entity25 convinced of his greatness but that will remain one of mine			2
along , of course , with the goals and the wondrous touches of skill			0
the magic is beginning to enchant the watching world , especially as it its couched within his boyish charm			0
reverence : the 22 - year - old insists on having ' @entity25 ' on his back , such is his respect for his father the best : @entity1 is widely regarded as @entity6 's greatest ever player but @entity25 is now making his mark treble : @entity1 won three @entity18 and @entity25 is hoping to inspire @entity6 to their sixth triumph he scores , four times already on his way to what may be his winning of the @entity154 at this @entity27			1
he mingles with the @entity82 people as if he is still simply one of their own			2
in that , he is more reminiscent of @entity7 than @entity1			1
for that , they love him all the more			0
but in the reckoning it is the exquisite ability that counts			0
in a game increasingly populated by men of muscle and power , he is a wraith wrapped around silken skills			0
in that he reminds me of @entity168 , a will o ’ the wisp with the courage to deliver his talent			0
i defer to no - one in my worship of the pantheon of @entity82 footballers but in my estimation @entity25 is close to superceding most of them ... @entity178 , @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity91 and @entity184 included			1
time will be the judge , of course			0
but he is so good that the modern generation have a discussion in which to engage which is of their time			0
the tendency has been to propose @entity193 and @entity14 as the current pretenders to the thrones of not only @entity196 but @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199			0
class : arguably only @entity7 ( left ) and @entity1 now stand ahead of @entity25 in @entity6 's all - time great list both are marvellous player but @entity25 brings something all the more valid to the debate			1
@entity205 tends to operate on the wide right so as to cut in onto this wand of a left foot and @entity14 is inclined to work the left flank in readiness for angling in onto his potent right			0
but @entity25 works where it hurts , where it can do the most damage , where it really matters			2
that is how he has come to play 53 games for his country at such a tender age , scoring 37 goals in the process			1
that is why he just might win this @entity27 for @entity6			1
that is why he is climbing so quickly through the ranks of greatness			0
i would suggest that only two giants remain for him to elevate himself above - @entity1 and @entity7			1
that enormous task does not appear to be beyond him			0
it will take more than one @entity27 to make it happen but if he works his magic here , he could well be on his way to immortality			2
perhaps , one day , he will be talked of not as the new @entity1 - but as the first @entity25			1
@entity33 will handle the pressure - ronaldo clinical : @entity14 scored important goals for @entity6 to help them to @entity27 glory in 2002 finisher : @entity25 strikes to score his second during @entity6 's 4 - 1 victory over @entity30			1

@entity25 has scored 37 goals in 53 internationals for @entity6
he is only 22 years old but could inspire his nation to lift the @entity27
@entity25 scored twice as @entity6 beat @entity30 4 - 1 to *qualify* for last 16
arguably only @entity1 and @entity7 now bigger ' giants ' of @entity82 football
he insists on having ' @entity25 ' on shirt such is his reverence of his father
