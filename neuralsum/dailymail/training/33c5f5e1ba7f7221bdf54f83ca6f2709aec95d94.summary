by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 31 december 2012 updated : 04:34 est , 1 january 2013 flt lt @entity1 in 1942 when stationed at @entity2			1
he has left money in his will to help restore the tower a unique wartime control tower where classic film @entity7 was filmed has been saved from ruin thanks to the legacy of a @entity7 pilot			1
more than 70 years after the movie starring @entity13 and @entity14 was recorded at @entity2 the dilapidated concrete building is to be restored to its former glory after wartime pilot @entity1 left thousands dedicated to the cause in his will			1
then prime minister @entity19 gave his permission for @entity21 to be used for the biopic which chronicles the true story of how two of the most remarkable men in aviation history - visionary spitfire designer @entity26 and his test pilot @entity28 - designed a streamlined monoplane that led to the development of the @entity7			1
but the film was shot while the tower was in use and work was constantly interrupted when real @entity7 pilots had to scramble but it was thanks to this that @entity14 was able to recreate scenes from the @entity40 from the first hand accounts of @entity42 and 118 - which fought in the 1940 battle - and were based there			1
some of the @entity45 pilots were even given small parts in the movie			2
ironically , the base was just a few miles from the one - time home of @entity51 propagandist the traitor @entity53 , nicknamed @entity54			0
he moved from the area in 1937 shortly before he left for @entity56 and began his notorious radio broadcasts			0
the @entity58 has now secured a lease for the air base in @entity62 's @entity61 and now hope to preserve it forever by turning it into a museum using some of the money left in @entity68 lt @entity1 's will			1
before he died in 2010 aged in his late 80s , @entity68 lt @entity1 recalled his time at @entity21 , which is near the town of @entity72			1
@entity1 , pictured in 2010 back in the @entity21 control tower he fought to save for the nation , and where classic film @entity7 was filmed more than 70 years after the movie starring @entity13 and @entity14 was recorded at @entity2 the dilapidated concrete building is to be brought back to life he said : ' i was posted to @entity21 just a few weeks after they finished filming @entity7 in early 1942			1
' there were three squadrons based there including 501 , which was the one i was in			0
' i remember flying in and out of the @entity61 during the war and i 've always lived locally so i 've watched as the tower has become neglected			2
' it all looks a bit different now because gravel has been extracted from the ground and that process has left lakes near the old air base			0
' although the tower is just a shell , the surroundings are beautiful with the lakes and trees			2
the @entity7 told the true story of two of the most remarkable men in aviation history - visionary spitfire designer @entity26 and his test pilot @entity28 a spitfire pictured at @entity106 , where three squadrons were based during @entity108 ' it is the only tower in the forest that it is possible to restore and we just hope that we can get it done			1
the @entity40 was the @entity56 air force 's attempt to gain air superiority over the @entity45 from july to september 1940			0
it was one of the turning points of @entity108 and prevented @entity56 from invading @entity40			2
the battle began in mid-july with @entity120 concentrating on attacking shipping in the @entity122 and attacking coastal towns and defences			0
from 12 august , @entity125 , one of the leaders of the @entity51 regime , shifted his focus to the destruction of the @entity45 , attacking the many airfields and radar bases which had sprung up across the country during the war			2
convinced that @entity134 was now close to defeat , he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break @entity139 strength			0
however , @entity125 grew frustrated by the large number of @entity139 planes that were still fighting off his attacks			0
@entity120 switched tactics again and , on @entity145 's orders , set about destroying @entity146 and other major cities			0
eleven days later , on what became ' @entity149 ' , the @entity45 decimated the huge incoming @entity120 formations in the skies above @entity146 and the south coast			0
the tower , a so called type 518/40 ' @entity155 with @entity157 ' base , is similar to about 50 others that were built for @entity108 but it was the only one with concrete floors and balcony			1
the trust will now start weatherproofing and carrying out structural surveys of the building in the next few months , followed by refurbishment plans and a major fund - raising campaign			2
the news has delighted @entity169 , president of the @entity170 that has been campaigning for many years for the building to be saved			2
the widow of @entity40 pilot flight lieutenant @entity173 , who was also a driver at @entity21 in the war , said : ' at last it finally feels like something is happening			2
' i 'm absolutely delighted that this building will be given a new and useful purpose , telling future generations the story of @entity2 , its squadrons and the many thousands of personnel that served there			1
' @entity186 , chairman of the @entity45 @entity58 , said : ' it is the last chance saloon for this building and if it gets much more damaged by rain it will be beyond saving			0
' it is a unique building and was the first base that the @entity192 took over and was the place where they flew their first sorties from			0
' to make it succeed it has to be about more than just rescuing a unique building from dereliction , we must also give it a sustainable future			0
' we want to create somewhere for people to come and find out about @entity2 and show them how a @entity108 airfield would have operated			1
' we intend to tell the stories of the people that lived around the airfield , and the impact it had on their lives			0
' we want to restore the building as a tribute , from our generation , to the service personnel from @entity214 and around the world that served at @entity2 and , in particular , to those that lost their lives while stationed here			1
' 501 @entity7 squadron at @entity2 in 1942			1
some of those posted at @entity2 had bit parts and helped contribute to the film starring @entity13 and @entity14 the @entity170 was formed in 1992 and consisted mainly of people who worked at the base			1
the @entity45 @entity58 has been formed recently to concentrate on securing the future of the building			0
the airbase is surrounded by lakes because the area was used to extract gravel from after the war .			0

pilot @entity1 *vowed* to restore @entity2 to its former glory before he died in 2010
the film was shot while the tower was in use and work was interrupted when real @entity7 pilots were scrambled
it is hoped the building will be turned into a museum telling story of @entity108 airfields
