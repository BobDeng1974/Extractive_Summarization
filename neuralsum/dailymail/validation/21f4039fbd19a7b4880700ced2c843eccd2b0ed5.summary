an endoscopy revealed mp @entity2 's heartburn was in fact oesophageal cancer mp @entity2 was out for dinner with friends when , inexplicably , he found himself struggling to swallow			1
‘ it felt as if the food was catching on the way down , ’ says the @entity8 member for @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11			1
‘ after a few mouthfuls i realised it was n’t going to budge and i had to run to the toilet and throw up			0
’ initially , he put it down to a bug , but over the next week it happened again and again			0
‘ soup was fine but anything tougher , such as steak , would feel as if it was catching , ’ says @entity2 , 57 , who is divorced and has three children aged 27 , 25 and 22			1
‘ i was not overly concerned ; i thought i was a relatively healthy person , i do n’t smoke and i play sport			0
' being a @entity29 , however , brings with it an unhealthy lifestyle — i often would not eat until midnight and i drink a bit more than the official guidelines			0
but i thought , on balance , i was in pretty good shape			0
’ his only complaint was the odd bit of heartburn			1
but he thought that was a common problem and nothing to worry about			0
however , in december 2011 , after three weeks with no improvement , he realised it was time to see his doctor			0
she thought it might be acid indigestion or reflux and prescribed some strong antacids , which did n’t help			0
she also referred @entity2 for an endoscopy , when a camera attached to a tube is fed down the throat			1
he had the investigation five weeks later which found he had a growth bulging across his oesophagus , the pipe that carries food from the mouth to the stomach			1
tests revealed it was cancer			1
‘ i felt as if the floor had dropped away , ’ he says			1
‘ i thought : “ that ’s it , i ’m going to die			0
” ' i was thinking of my three children , and how i would n’t see them go on to establish their own families and i ’d never meet my grandchildren			0
’ oesophageal cancer is becoming increasingly common			1
between 1977 and 2011 , the number of cases soared — by 65 per cent in men and 26 per cent in women , according to @entity75			0
‘ no other country in @entity80 has a higher incidence of this cancer than we do , ’ says @entity76 , professor of gastrointestinal surgery at the @entity78 , @entity79			2
we have the highest incidence of the most common form of oesophageal cancer — called adenocarcinoma — in the world , he adds			2
this is thought to be linked to our high rates of obesity and alcohol intake			0
the prognosis is often poor : only 40 per cent of patients are alive 12 months after their diagnosis			0
‘ there is a very low survival rate for this cancer , ’ says @entity97 , health information officer at @entity75			1
‘ after ten years , there is only a 10 per cent survival rate , whereas with breast or testicular cancer the rate is 80 to 90 per cent			1
’ one of the main problems is that people are n’t aware of the symptoms , so the cancer is not picked up until it is too late			1
research for @entity111 found 70 per cent had no idea that food sticking in your throat could be a sign of oesophageal or stomach cancer ; 59 per cent were not aware persistent heartburn was a sign , too			1
in fact , heartburn is n’t just a symptom of oesophageal cancer , it ’s also the cause in most cases			1
heartburn occurs when the acidic contents of the stomach splash up the oesophagus ; being overweight encourages this , putting pressure on the stomach			1
over years the splashed acid can cause changes to the type of cells lining the oesophagus and they become pre-cancerous , known as @entity141 ’s oesophagus			2
about 6 per cent of those with @entity141 ’s go on to develop oesophageal cancer			2
heartburn is n’t just a symptom of oesophageal cancer , it ’s also the cause in most cases ( file picture ) oesophageal cancer is also linked to a diet low in fruit and vegetables , and to smoking and drinking — possibly because these irritate the cells that line the oesophagus			1
it can also run in families			0
men are three times more likely to develop adenocarcinoma — the most common type — than women			0
why is unclear , but one theory is the female oesophagus is more resistant to damage , says professor @entity76			2
the problem is that many people , like @entity2 , think heartburn is ‘ just one of those things ’			1
‘ i had it once or more a week for a year before my diagnosis and thought everyone got a bit of heartburn			2
i would take @entity179 and not think any more of it , ’ he admits			0
professor @entity76 says occasional heartburn a few times a month is acceptable , but adds : ‘ persistent heartburn is not normal			2
’ @entity111 has launched a campaign encouraging people to visit their gp if they have heartburn most days for three weeks or more			1
oesophageal cancer , pictured , is becoming increasingly common			2
between 1977 and 2011 , the number of cases soared - by 65 per cent in men and 26 per cent in women yet , @entity2 believes the situation could be helped by improving access to @entity193			1
last month , he made a speech to the @entity195 asking the health minister to consider this			0
‘ if i need to see a gp i have to ring during this narrow window between 8am to 8.10am to try to secure an appointment for that day , ’ he says			0
‘ i think that means people put off going and getting their symptoms checked , as i did			1
’ if the disease is caught at an early stage , pre-cancerous or even cancerous cells can simply be burned or cut away			2
however , when it is more advanced , the usual option is to remove the oesophagus almost in its entirety			2
the stomach is then moved up and a section of the oesophagus that is left will be attached to it			1
‘ it is the most high - risk elective surgery there is , as you have to open the abdomen and the chest , which is major trauma for the body			0
it ’s like going through a car crash , ’ says professor @entity76			0
he says only a third of the patients referred to him are eligible even to try ‘ curative ’ treatment as , once diagnosed , their cancer is often too advanced and they are too frail			2
@entity2 ’s biopsy was not conclusive , but the fact he had a mass there convinced surgeons it was best to remove most of his oesophagus			1
he had the operation in april 2012			0
‘ i was happy to trust the surgeon ’s advice , although i did n’t realise just how major an operation it would be , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ afterwards they give you a button you can push to administer yourself some morphine and their notes showed i pushed mine 535 times the first day			0
’ for three weeks , he was fed through a tube directly into his stomach			2
a week after the operation he was told the mass was a grade iii cancer , meaning it was aggressive and had spread to nearby lymph nodes			2
‘ i ’d wanted to delay the operation until july			0
thank goodness i did n’t , as if i had , i ’d be dead now , ’ says @entity2 bluntly			1
he needed six weeks of radiotherapy followed by chemotherapy for five months			0
@entity2 now wishes he had gone to his gp sooner as he might not have needed such major treatment			1
yet , professor @entity76 says , even those who do go to their gp may have their diagnosis held up because they will not get an endoscopy soon enough			0
‘ if someone is suspected of having cancer then they should have one within two weeks			2
but often these people are n’t referred with suspected cancer , as it might be heartburn , and they can wait for up to 18 weeks , ’ he says			1
for @entity2 , life has changed			1
he gets tired easily and whereas he used to look forward to meals out with his girlfriend , @entity274 , much of the joy of eating has gone for him			0
certain foods such as risotto or anything stodgy are off - limits as it can get caught in the new connection between his stomach and what remains of his oesophagus			1
he is more prone to reflux , so takes omeprazole — which reduces stomach acid production — every day , and has regular scans			0
‘ i had my last one on thursday and it came back all - clear , so i am now officially in remission , ’ he says , relief evident in his voice			0
@entity2 is optimistic about the future and is standing down as an mp in may			1
but he is certain of his commitment to help others avoid what he ’s been through : ‘ if i can at least get one person to go to the doctor sooner than they would have done , then i will be pleased			0

@entity2 struggled to swallow and felt food catching in his throat
the mp said his only symptoms was the odd bout of heartburn
but tests revealed he had a *tumour* bulging across his oesophagus , the pipe that carries food from the mouth to the stomach
low survival rate for the cancer because people are not aware of the symptoms , so the disease is often not picked up until it is too late
