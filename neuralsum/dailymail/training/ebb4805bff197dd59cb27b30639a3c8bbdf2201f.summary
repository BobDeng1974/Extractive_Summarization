in december , in the face of stiff competition , and following a consecutive drop in profits , @entity2 announced plans to curb the number of phones it makes each year			2
earlier this week , @entity216 posted this video on @entity146			0
it 's a rap parody poking fun at @entity2 and @entity7			0
lyrics include : ' more than a few clowns stole what we originated			0
we own the universe , your @entity4 is overrated ' , and ' it took you copycats six times to get it right / my one @entity153 is great , you ’ll never touch this light ' meanwhile , @entity2 's next generation @entity231 could have a curved screen that covers both its sides			2
the handset is also expected to have a 5.5 - inch screen to rival @entity7 ’s @entity54			1
@entity2 's @entity187 ( pictured ) was the first to use a curved screen when it was unveiled in @entity178 last year instead of releasing handset after handset and saturating the market with @entity2 devices , the firm has decided it needs to concentrate on making fewer handsets , better			1
the @entity60 manufacturer is also expected to ramp up production of its remaining models so they can be sold more cheaply			2
the strategy was unveiled during a presentation in @entity248 by @entity2 's head of investor relations , @entity249			0
he said the company would reduce the number of smartphone models in 2015 by between a quarter and a third			0
in a rare acknowledgement , mr @entity249 added that @entity2 had lagged behind changing market conditions			0
the company moved the launch of the @entity260 , a large smartphone with a stylus , to late september from october after @entity7 unveiled the @entity262			2
it also began sales of the @entity260 4 in @entity264 last month , getting an early start in the world 's most populous country before @entity7			0
@entity7 released it first phablet - style devices in september , and it appears the gamble paid off			2
during the first quarter of 2015 , @entity7 announced it sold a staggering 74.5 million iphones in the same quarter - up from 51 million during the same period a year ago			1
these was the first quarter that the 4.7 - inch and 5.5 - inch @entity6 and 6 @entity274 were on sale			2
however , sales of @entity277 dropped by 18 per cent , which knocked @entity7 's revenue in that sector by 22 per cent			0
this was the largest year - on - year decrease released by @entity7			1
the decline has been blamed on a dip in tablet popularity in general , as well as the rising popularity of phablets			0
as phones increase in size , and close the gap between the size of tablet displays , analysts predict fewer people will buy , or need , the two gadgets			0
the company 's response ' was not quick enough , ' said mr @entity249 .			0
