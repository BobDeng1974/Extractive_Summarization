by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:46 est , 1 september 2012 updated : 13:00 est , 3 september 2012 it 's a crucial question in the @entity4 saga that has remained unanswered for nearly 40 years : what caused the murderous rage that led him to kill the family nanny , batter his pretty young wife and then flee , never to return ? now dramatic new evidence can be revealed that throws fresh light on what may have driven @entity4 into such a violent fury before he killed @entity15 with a lead pipe and left @entity17 with serious head wounds			1
it comes in a remarkable testimony from former croupier @entity21 , who claims to be one of the last people to have seen @entity4 before he vanished , and who has finally broken his silence on the tragic events of november 7 , 1974			1
croupier @entity21 tells how peer gambled away equivalent of £ 50k in an hour mr @entity28 said he watched in astonishment that night at the @entity30 in @entity31 as so - called @entity32 , a notorious gambler , lost £ 8,000 – roughly equivalent to £ 50,000 today – in just over an hour playing blackjack , before exploding with rage and attempting to overturn the card table			1
the game started at 7.40pm and @entity4 left in a fury at 8.50pm – ten minutes before detectives believe 29 - year - old mrs @entity15 was killed at @entity4 ’s @entity41 home , an eight - minute drive away			1
mr @entity28 added : ‘ when the papers came out with the story of the nanny ’s murder , i did wonder whether it was us that tipped him over the edge			1
’ mr @entity28 , 61 , who now lives in the @entity52 , had been working at the @entity30 after qualifying as a croupier and was making ends meet while he saved up for acting school			1
he recalled how he first set eyes on @entity4 , wearing full evening dress , at 7.40pm on the night of the murder			1
he said : ‘ i am very sure of his arrival time because i had just begun my 7.30pm break			1
i was ten minutes into it when i was asked to come down and set up a private blackjack table			1
@entity4 came to the table with four £ 1,000 blue plaques which i would exchange for £ 25 chips as and when he required			1
7th @entity67 with fiancee @entity68 on the announcement of their engagement in 1963 @entity4 's @entity73 watering hole ? @entity74 in @entity75 , where two engineers believe they saw @entity32 ‘ i took that £ 4,000 off him pretty quickly , maybe 30 to 35 minutes			1
’ mr @entity28 remembered @entity4 going to the cash desk and returning with another £ 4,000			2
‘ this time , i took the money off him even quicker – inside 25 minutes			2
at the end , he was down to his last £ 25 chip			2
‘ he looked at me , waiting for the deal			2
i politely reminded him of the terms of the game – minimum two hands ; minimum £ 25 stake on each			2
his face went white , he became extremely aggressive and he barked at me , “ listen boy , when i tell you to deal , you deal			2
” i dealt the hand and @entity4 lost again			2
‘ in that moment , he exploded with rage			0
he clenched his fists and brought them down with a huge bang on the table			0
his face was contorted ; he was absolutely furious			0
‘ my entire year ’s salary was £ 4,000 and he had lost twice that inside an hour			1
he tried to tip the blackjack table over and @entity100 [ a casino supervisor ] and i threw ourselves on top of it to stop him			0
he stormed out and that was the last we saw of him			0
’ mr @entity28 said he never told his story at the time out of a sense of loyalty to his employers at the casino , and also because he feared his account would never be believed in the face of what he insists was an @entity114 cover - up			0
he eventually gave a statement to a metropolitan police officer by telephone earlier this year , following claims that @entity4 was living secretly in @entity73			0
bad loser : notorious gambler @entity4 with fellow card players at a @entity123 club after the nanny was killed and @entity17 attacked , @entity4 fled in a @entity125 borrowed from one of his gambling friends			1
it was found abandoned at @entity129 on the @entity131 coast			0
there were bloodstains on the front seat and a length of lead piping , wrapped in bandages , in the boot			1

a spokesman for the @entity143 would not discuss mr @entity28 ’s statement but added : ‘ the inquiry has never been closed			0
any significant new information will be considered			0
’ the @entity30 enjoyed a short but chequered history			1
in 1979 , it was mired in scandal over how it lured well - heeled new customers			0
profits soared after the club paid a network of private eyes to note the number plates of expensive cars arriving at rival casinos and a corrupt policeman was allegedly paid to supply the owners ’ addresses			0
