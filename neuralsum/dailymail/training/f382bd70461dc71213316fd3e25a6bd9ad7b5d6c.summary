the families of five @entity2 airmen who were shot down during a bombing raid more than 70 years ago are calling on the government to help recover their bodies from a @entity7 swamp			1
the young men of @entity9 were shot down during a night raid over @entity11 in 1943 and the location of their crash was thought to have been lost after the war			1
their relatives were never told where the plane landed but when the swamp they crashed into began to dry up , pieces of the aircraft were pushed to the surface and revealed their final resting place			1
some of the crew of @entity9 , which was shot down during a raid over @entity11 in 1943			1
they are , from left , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			0
the bodies of flight sergeant @entity29 and sergeant @entity27 were the only ones to be recovered flight sergeant @entity33 , left , and sergeant @entity34 , right , who were both lost when the aircraft crashed and their bodies have yet to be recovered @entity7 authorites have now granted permission for the plane and the bodies of the five @entity43 airmen to be recovered			1
however , their requests to the governments of the @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 to help fund the £ 165,000 recovery operation have been rejected			1
one of the men who died in the raid was @entity48 flight sergeant @entity33 , who left behind widow @entity53 , now aged 92			2
her daughter @entity54 says the family do n't have the heart to explain to her mother that he will not be recovered from the mud			0
she said : ' they were married for two days when he got called to service and never returned home			2
you can imagine her reaction when i told her @entity33 's plane was found after all these years			0
' all those years of wondering what happened to him - my heart broke for her			0
' i have not told her that the recovery is at a standstill due to a lack of funding , i do n't want to put her through that			0
she keeps asking if they found him and i just tell her it takes time			0
' @entity7 authorites have now granted permission for the plane and the bodies of the five @entity43 airmen to be recovered			1
pictured is flight sergeant @entity28 mrs @entity53 said the three @entity43 countries have a duty to fund the rescue operation which has been planned by volunteer recovery specialists			1
@entity87 , 94 , is the sister of trapped @entity47 navigator sergeant @entity34 and is desperate for him to receive a ' proper burial '			0
mrs @entity91 , from @entity92 , @entity93 , said : ' i think the government should do something - they went down protecting the country and doing their duty			0
' it would be a nice thing for them to finally be laid to rest in a proper burial			0
' the young bomber crew were shot down on august 23 , 1943 , and crashed into the @entity106 swamp 35 miles north of @entity11			1
crash reports unearthed in the @entity109 archives reveal @entity111 soldiers recovered the bodies of @entity49 air gunners flight sergeant @entity29 , 27 , and sergeant @entity27 , whose bodies were thrown free of the aircraft and later buried in the @entity11 war cemetery			1
an aerial shot of the swamp crash site near to @entity11 where the aircraft crashed in august 1943 the location of the crash site sank without trace in the archives of the @entity109 after the war , and the families were never told of the location			1
only after the swamp began to dry up in recent years was the crash location rediscovered			1
the remaining trapped crew are @entity49 pilot flight sergeant @entity28 , 21 , @entity47 aircrew sergeant @entity132 , 32 , sergeant @entity34 , 20 , sergeant @entity134 , 21 , and @entity48 flight sergeant @entity135			0
now a team of recovery experts from the @entity48 @entity139 organisation and a team of @entity7 aviation archaeologists from @entity142 have drawn up an excavation plan			2
the operation , costing £ 165,000 , involves using ' ground freezing ' refrigerated probes to create a 200ft - diameter circular wall of frozen swamp around the crash site			2
inside the frozen wall they will then pump out the thick muddy soup covering the wreckage			0
the team of recovery experts , who are hoping to excavate the aircraft and the bodies from the swamp , led by @entity158 , bottom right recovery co-ordinator @entity160 , a director of the @entity161 of @entity48 and president of the recovery group @entity163 , warned that without funding from governments or business an excavation would not be possible			1
he said : ' the leaders of our governments have the funding to do this recovery but they will not provide the collaborative seed money to do the right thing			2
' these air warriors who gave us our freedom lie in the mud and should not be there			0
' a spokesman for the @entity181 said they did not fund archaeological digs of historic aircraft , but if remains were found they would pay for a burial in the local area where they were discovered			2
@entity161 crews suffered a terrifyingly high casualty rate during the war			0
with 55,573 killed out of a total of 125,000 aircrew between 1939 to 1945 , bomber crews had a worse chance of survival than an infantry officer in the trenches of the @entity199 .			0
