much maligned former @entity1 striker @entity0 is finally fulfilling his potential – six years after the £ 18million move which was marked him out as one of the world ’s hottest prospects			1
his eventual inevitable return back to @entity8 looked to take the then - shaggy haired towering but clumsy frontman out of the spotlight , but now he could be leading the line for the five - time @entity14 winners in his home country - complete with a new , more sensible haircut			0
arriving as @entity17 ’ first signing as manager , @entity0 was an early sign for @entity1 fans that their new - found blank chequebook could not necessarily buy success			2
flop : @entity23 @entity0 signed for @entity1 in 2008 in an £ 18m deal but struggled to make an impact goal brought : @entity0 struck just 11 times at @entity1 and was shipped out on loan to @entity29 in his second season revival : yet @entity0 will likely make an come off the bench for hosts @entity8 in the @entity14 opener against @entity35 the @entity23 centre - forward arrived from @entity37 with the objective of being the star striker to lead a new blue era , but the reality was not so pretty			1
he managed just 11 goals during his time at the @entity44 – with five of those coming against small sides in the @entity47 and @entity48			1
a loan spell at @entity29 sandwiched between two seasons in sky blue was not hugely successful either , producing just two goals : against 10 - man @entity53 in the @entity48 and soon - to - be relegated @entity54 in the @entity47			2
second chance : @entity0 was sent out to @entity29 on loan from @entity1 but scored just twice for the @entity29 international : @entity0 has now played for @entity58 's @entity8 side 15 times , scoring on five occasions he even returned to @entity61 without permission over the @entity64 period in 2009 , angering then boss @entity65			1
@entity0 bowed out from the @entity66 as a big - money flop , quietly returning to @entity8 and @entity68 where he spent twelve months before joining current club @entity69			0
even back in his home country the 6 ' 2 " striker failed to initially shine – five goals in 36 games for @entity68 did n’t exactly set the world alight and he even missed a flight for an away game after over-celebrating his birthday			0
but he has impressed at @entity78 alongside former @entity80 winner @entity79 and was top scorer in his first season at the club as they won the @entity61 equivalent of the @entity85 , the @entity86			0
bad hair day : gone is the long , curly hair which @entity0 sported in @entity90 now he is at @entity69 joking around : @entity0 ( right ) enjoys a laugh with @entity93 team - mate @entity92			0

@entity0 signed for @entity1 from @entity37 for £ 18m in 2008
he was seen as one of world 's hottest prospects but he struggled at @entity1
the @entity23 managed just 11 goals at @entity1 and two on loan at @entity29
moved back to @entity61 and now plays for @entity104
he is likely to appear off the bench *tonight* for @entity8 against @entity35
