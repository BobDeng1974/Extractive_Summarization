by @entity0 @entity1 's is close to completing a move for @entity5 full - back @entity3			1
it is understood the @entity7 are hopeful of striking a deal for the 23 - year - old @entity9 international within the next 24 hours after becoming increasingly frustrated in their pursuit of @entity14 defender @entity13			2
indeed , club officials were hopeful of including @entity16 in the party heading off for a pre-season training camp in @entity19 on friday			0
@entity20 of class : @entity16 seen playing for @entity22 ( left ) and the @entity9 national team ( right ) this year depleted : @entity1 know he faces a race against time to get players in before the start of the season the @entity20 , who came through the ranks at @entity5 while sporting director @entity29 was at the club , has spent the last two - and - a - half seasons on loan at @entity22			1
he has made only nine senior appearances for the @entity34 and has been sent out on loan to five different clubs , including a month at @entity37 in 2010			0
however , he has indicated that he feels his future lies away from @entity39 , and @entity7 are keen to take advantage of his hunger for regular first - team football			0
@entity16 's capture does not necessarily preclude a continuation of efforts to land @entity13 , who proved a key player on loan last season , but it would provide a welcome boost for @entity1 , whose hopes of sealing a permanent deal for @entity52 are also yet to be realised .			2
