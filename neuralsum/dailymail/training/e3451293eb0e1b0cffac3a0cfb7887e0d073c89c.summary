by @entity0 published : 14:00 est , 19 april 2012 updated : 08:22 est , 20 april 2012 it still has the same gleaming red paintwork and immaculate grey nylon weave interior as it did the day it rolled off the assembly line			0
the odometer shows just delivery mileage and there are no proper licence plates as the owner has not yet had it registered with the @entity12			1
which is odd , since the car in question is a @entity17 @entity16 , built more than 30 years ago			1
pride and joy : @entity20 , from @entity21 , with the 31 - year - old @entity17 which he is selling despite its venerable age , this unique ' brand new ' @entity23 - badged @entity17 has never been driven on a public road , as the absence of wear on its tyres testifies , and its @entity31 owner @entity20 has only ever allowed it out of locked storage on the back of a trailer for rare appearances at classic car shows			1
now , the 47 - year - old car enthusiast , who bought the car seven years ago for £ 9,995 , has decided to auction off his pride and joy and the car ’s unusual provenance could spark a bidding war among fanatical old @entity45 collectors			1
mr @entity20 , a member of the @entity46 , said yesterday : ' i do n’t think there will be another one in this condition			0
there ’s only delivery mileage on the clock and it ’s brand new			2
first - class conditon : mr @entity20 , a member of the @entity46 , said yesterday : ' i do n't think there will be another one in this condition			2
there 's only delivery mileage on the clock and it 's brand new ' unique : mr @entity20 's @entity63 , four - speed petrol version was among the last batch of @entity65 to leave @entity45 's @entity67 plant in 1981 before production switched to the new @entity70 model ' initially , i bought it to drive it			1
i had already done up another @entity17 as a hobby and i have always liked them			1
they were the type of cars i worked on when i did my engineering apprenticeship so i always had a soft spot for them			0
overview at first glance the @entity17 ‘ 80 did n’t look much different to the @entity82 , but it received a huge number of improvements that kept it on top until the arrival of the @entity70 in 1982			1
the most prized models are the wood - trimmed @entity90 and the run - out crusader , which buyers clamoured for in 1982 , in preference to buying a new @entity70			2
price at launch : £ 3475 0 - 60mph : 16.1secs top speed : 87mph power : 61bhp torque : @entity100 length : 4326mm wheelbase : 2578mm width : 1702mm height : 1321mm weight : 965kgs ' because of its unique history , i always resisted driving it			1
i used to take it to car rallies on the back of trailer puller by my other @entity17 , which is actually older			1
' but there is only so long you can keep doing that , so i have decided to sell up and give someone else the pleasure of owning this piece of @entity122 ’s motoring history			0
' more than 2,600,000 @entity123 were sold in @entity122 in the 20 years since its launch in 1962 , making it the third most popular car ever sold in the @entity122			0
a @entity128 revived popularity when it starred in the hit @entity132 detective series @entity133			0
the @entity134 easily stood out from the @entity82 predecessor due to its larger lamp clusters , wraparound bumpers and newly - designed aeroflow radiator grille			2
build quality and rust resistance were also improved			0
mr @entity20 ’s @entity63 , four - speed petrol version was among the last batch of @entity65 to leave @entity45 ’s @entity67 plant in 1981 before production switched to the new @entity70 model			2
it was immediately snapped up by @entity147 millionaire @entity148 , who had a number of @entity45 dealerships around the country and built up a celebrated collection of ' last ever ' models			0
the vehicle was sent direct from the factory to @entity156 in 1982 with no fluids and had been dry stored for 23 years , before being sold to mr @entity158 in 2005 for £ 9,995			1
when father - of - two mr @entity20 , who is chief engineer for @entity161 in @entity21 , bought the car seven years ago , he left the @entity12 ' flummoxed ” when he tried to register it for use			2
' i got it after i was told about it by someone in my car club			0
they said a multi-millionaire enthusiast called @entity148 had kept it in his collection since buying it new			0
apparently , he used to buy the last model made of different kinds of cars and he bought this one when @entity45 stopped making @entity178 and started the @entity70			0
' he kept it until he died and then i bought it			0
up for auction : @entity20 will be hoping a keen @entity45 fan is taken with the @entity17 showroom shine : mr @entity20 added : ' i have no idea what it would be worth now , but it would have been about £ 5,500 new in 1981			1
i am still considering my options for how best to auction it ' ' it came out the same year the @entity70 was launched and it does n’t even have a number plate			2
the plate just says @entity17			1
anybody who buys it can choose their own number if they want to register it			0
' i went to the @entity12 and asked what number it would get and they did n’t know			0
they had never been asked about the first registration of such an old car before and it completely flummoxed them			0
' eventually somebody said there was no reason why it could not be given the latest number available , which would make it a 61 - plate			2
then , they said it could be given a number that would have been generated on the computer from 1981 , which would make it a y - reg. ' mr @entity20 added : ' i have no idea what it would be worth now , but it would have been about £ 5,500 new in 1981			1
i am still considering my options for how best to auction it			0
@entity220 , editor of @entity222 magazine , said : ' this is very exciting news to see a @entity45 from the @entity148 collection come onto the market and still in such good condition , although anyone who wants to drive it will have to spend a bit of money making it road - worthy			1
' it is possible that mr @entity20 only manage to get back what he paid for the car at auction , but @entity45 collectors can be fanatical and if two of them decide they really want it then the sky ’s the limit really			1
' old favourite : the television programme ' @entity133 ' , starring @entity243 ( left ) and @entity244 ( right ) has re-introduced the @entity17 in to the spotlight			1

unique ' brand new ' gl - badged @entity17 has never been driven on a public road , as the absence of wear on its tyres testifies
owner paid £ 9,995 for 1970s icon but ' skies the limit ' at auction says expert
