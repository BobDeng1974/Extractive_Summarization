according to the plan the ' worst case threat scenario , ' is a zombie attack in which zombies eating lots of humans therefore infecting them quickly , leaving little time for a response			1
the document also addresses ' @entity42 ' otherwise known as chicken zombies			1
' although it sounds ridiculous , this is actually the only proven class of zombie that actually exists , ' the plan states			2
@entity48 8888 ' so - called ' @entity49 ' occur when old hens that can no longer lay eggs are euthanized by farmers with carbon monoxide , buried , and then claw their way back to the surface , ' conop 8888 notes			2
other possible attacks include evil magic zombies created through occult experimentation and vegetarian zombies which survive on plants so pose no threat to human life and zombies from space			1
the report contains a disclaimer that ' this plan was not actually designed as a joke ' , but it originated after military planners in @entity71 , @entity72 , wanted a scenario for dealing with a widespread national emergency			2
the @entity6 's contingency plans for a zombie onslaught emerged in from an unclassified document called ' @entity21 ' - otherwise known as ' @entity22 ' they created a zombie attack plan that covered training civilians how to survive in a post-apocalyptic world - deployment of military was also a large factor in the plans			1
' the document is identified as a training tool used in an in - house training exercise where students learn about the basic concepts of military plans and order development through a fictional training scenario , ' navy capt. @entity85 wrote to the magazine in an email			1
' this document is not a @entity97 plan			1
' it is not unusual for the @entity99 to be called upon to save the day in zombie films			2
in 2004 comedy @entity102 , soldiers arrive just in time to save the film 's hero			0
in 2012 , troops in the @entity107 were trained using a mock zombie invasion			0
hundreds of military , law enforcement and medical personnel observed the @entity113 - style production of a zombie attack as part of their emergency response training			0
in the scenario , dubbed ' @entity119 ' , a vip was trapped in a village , surrounded by zombies when a bomb exploded			2
an attack of the zombies in the 2004 film ' @entity102 '			0
in the film the @entity99 comes to the rescue the vip was wounded and his team had to move through the town while dodging bullets and shooting at the invading zombies			0
at one point , some of the team are hit by zombies and have to be taken to a field medical facility for decontamination and treatment			0
the @entity141 is not the only country with a plan - so does @entity144 , in 2012 @entity144 's contingency plans for a zombie onslaught emerged in a response to an enquiry from a member of the public			1
a freedom of information request has shown the surprising level of readiness for the eventuality			0
the @entity155 would not lead efforts to plan for such a horror attack or deal with the aftermath , reported by the @entity160 , because that role would rest with the @entity162 , which co-ordinates emergency planning for the government			0
the @entity155 replied to the @entity166 request : ' in the event of an apocalyptic incident ( e.g. zombies ) , any plans to rebuild and return @entity168 to its pre-attack glory would be led by the @entity162 , and thus any pre-planning activity would also take place there			2
' the @entity155 's role in any such event would be to provide military support to the civil authorities , not take the lead			0
' consequently the @entity155 holds no information on this matter			0
