a son whose no - nonsense dad gave him a fitting punishment for being a bully - and sent his story viral - has seen the error of his ways			1
@entity7 , 13 , said ' thank you , i deserved that ' to dad @entity16 , who surprised him with a run , 60 push - ups and gardening chores at 4am in freezing @entity12 , @entity13 , after finding out he 'd been mistreating a classmate			1
a photograph showing @entity7 and @entity16 posing with a sign explaining his sentence has been shared thousands of times online			1
spelling it out : @entity24 was shocked to heard his son , @entity7 , had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him just desserts : @entity7 , 13 , is pictured above in the midst of a ' knuckle push - up ' , part of his grueling punishment from above : @entity7 said of the punishment ' i learned my lesson , and he 's a good dad for doing it ' another condition of the punishment is that it remains @entity7 's own @entity40 profile picture and cover photo until @entity7 relents			1
the surprise punishment , carried out wednesday in 32 - degree weather , came after @entity16 got wind that his son had insulted a classmate , and later pushed him into a locker while walking between classes			1
@entity7 , who heard what had happened from friends , decided not to let his son know in advance , but sprang the punishment on him at 4am			1
punished : @entity7 , pictured , was given an array of unpleasant tasks to make up for his wrongs after sitting him down and explaining what was about to happen , he dressed him up , stood over him during the push - ups then sent him out on the run			1
describing the experience to @entity62 , @entity7 said : ' it was stupid of me - i saw a kid and said a stupid , random comment			1
' ' when he found up , he woke me up at 3:30 in the morning , and he sat me down on the couch			0
and when i did n't come up with a good enough excuse to save my butt , i told the truth			0
' he made me do 50 knuckle push - ups , run a mile , then come back and do incline push - ups			1
and i 'm still not done			0
' ' i think it 's a really good punishment - i learned my lesson and he 's a good dad for doing it			2
' the two planned to have @entity7 apologize to the boy in question in front of his whole class , but school authorities decided a private meeting would be a better solution			2
@entity7 also apologized a second time when there were no teachers and parents around			0
speaking about his high - profile parenting , @entity7 said : ' he understood - he knows it was wrong and there have been no hard feelings since			2
' ' he actually has said " thank you , i deserved that , i understand it was wrong			0
" i believe he also apologized to the child another time the other day			0
' ' he did n't question his punishment - he had a look on his face , you can see he was n't very happy when he was getting his picture taken - but it 's been successful			2
' ' and seeing it go around the way it 's been going around - i would do anything to put this out there and say " hey , do n't let your child get away with this crap "			2
even small bullying can turn into something big			0
' apology : @entity7 was made to say sorry to his victim in front of his whole class at @entity116 , pictured @entity7 , who lives with @entity24 , who is a business consultant , and his wife , used to live with his mother in @entity119 , where he had a difficult past			0
but his father said he has seen him transform since coming north , and is now doing well at @entity116			0
under the original post , @entity7 had written : ' i teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it			0
' this is what happens when you become a bully ! i do n't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully ! ' please share this to end this behavior everywhere ! nothing changes until you take a stance and it only takes one person to start a revolution ! ' @entity7 concurs , adding : ' it 's a good message and i hope lots of people see it ' .			1
