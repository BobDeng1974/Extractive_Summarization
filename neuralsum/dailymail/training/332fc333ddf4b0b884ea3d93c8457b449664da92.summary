by @entity0 published : 06:51 est , 9 october 2012 updated : 08:45 est , 9 october 2012 a naked rambler has won a long battle to overturn his conviction for causing distress to a female dog walker who said she saw his genitals			2
naturist @entity9 , 42 , will now be continuing his nude hiking - once the weather warms up - after a panel of judges gave a list of reasons to quash his conviction			2
mr @entity9 appealed after magistrates found him guilty of the public order offence of causing distress to the woman as she walked her dog at a beauty spot called @entity23 , @entity24 , last october			1
overturned : naturist @entity9 , 42 , will now be continuing his nude hiking - once the weather warms up - after a panel of judges gave a list of reasons to quash his conviction for causing distress to a female dog walker the decision comes just two days after a man known as the @entity34 was released from serving his latest prison sentence			1
@entity34 celebrated his freedom by taking a hike in his birthday suit through nearby @entity39			2
the 53 - year - old was jailed for five months after he was arrested in july for being naked near a play - park in @entity42			2
meanwhile , a judge at @entity44 told mr @entity9 that his charge would be dismissed because the panel considered it unlikely that mr @entity9 ’s naked walk had caused any alarm			1
the court had heard that mr @entity9 was arrested by off - duty police officer pc @entity50 , who said he saw a woman appear ' distressed ' when she had noticed mr @entity52 in just his hiking boots on october 2 last year			1
relieved : bus driver mr @entity9 , of @entity44 , @entity24 , had denied the distress claims , and said naturism ' is about body freedom ' sitting with two justices on monday , judge @entity58 said @entity60 , who said he had been shocked by the incident , would not have been able to determine if the woman was distressed			1
dismissing the charges , he added : ' this behaviour was not carried out in front of a school or in the street in a town centre			1
it took place on moorland in broad daylight			1
' in view of the location of this incident , the time of day and the reaction of others as we have found it to be , we do not consider that anyone was likely to be harassed by this behaviour or intimidated or distressed			2
' the judge said there were no sexual motives behind the incident , adding : ' he was not deliberately flaunting himself or seeking attention or jumping out and doing what is colloquially called flashing			0
' he said that the police officer ’s reaction to seeing mr @entity9 could also be considered ' extreme given his experience			1
' bus driver mr @entity9 , of @entity44 , @entity24 , had denied the claims , and said naturism ' is about body freedom and in a way it is a mild protest against the expected social norms of wearing clothes every day '			1
speaking after the case , mr @entity9 said that he was delighted to have finally fought off the charge , which had kept him out of work for a number of months			1
he added : ' i ’ve kept up the naturism , but i ’ve been a bit more careful now			0
it ’s a bit cold to be doing anything at the moment , but once the weather warms up , i ’ll be back out there			0
' mr @entity9 has previously taken part in three naked world bike rides alongside other naturists			1
he had first become interested after being sent a letter from @entity117 in 2004			0
he initially thought it was a prank but he went on a naked swim anyway , leading to his love affair			0
he has even put it on his cv as an interest			0
naked : @entity34 was jailed for five months after he was arrested in july for being naked near a play park when the case first came to court last october , he said : ' i must admit that i was surprised when it came to court			2
' i do n’t feel i have committed an offence or distressed anyone			0
people are a lot more accepting now than they were five or six years ago			0
on the whole , most people are quite happy with it			0
' i love walking about naked			0
it ’s the feeling of being at one with nature and a feeling of liberation			0
if you are free of clothes you are free of worries			0

@entity9 was arrested by pc @entity50 who said he saw a woman appear ' distressed ' when she saw mr @entity9 rambling naked
a judge dismissed the charge because a panel considered it unlikely that he had caused any alarm
he said the rambling was *n't* near a school or a street in a town centre but took place on moorland in broad daylight
conviction is overturned just two days after the @entity34 was released from his latest prison sentence
