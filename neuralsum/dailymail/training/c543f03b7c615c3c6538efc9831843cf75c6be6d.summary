the islamic state terror group declared that @entity0 must either convert to @entity8 , pay a special tax or leave the city , around 250 miles north - west of @entity11			1
if they did not do so by noon ( 9am gmt ) today , there would be ' nothing for them but the sword ' , it said			1
above , @entity0 women pray at a church in @entity25 , @entity26 as militants attempted to break government defences in strategic areas and edge closer to @entity11 , @entity0 fled to join hundreds of thousands of @entity30 and other refugees in the neighbouring autonomous region of @entity26			1
their escape to the safety coincided with the expected homecoming of @entity1 's @entity26 president , @entity36 , after 18 months of medical treatment in @entity38			1
@entity40 patriarch @entity39 , who heads @entity1 's largest @entity0 community , said the terrifying ultimatum had been relayed by mosques in @entity4 - controlled @entity2			1
he told @entity44 : ' @entity0 families are on their way to @entity47 and @entity25 [ in @entity26 ]			1
for the first time in the history of @entity1 , @entity2 is now empty of @entity0			1
' refugees : the @entity0 joined hundreds of thousands of @entity30 and other refugees in the neighbouring autonomous region of @entity26			1
above , @entity53 flee from @entity54 to @entity25 yesterday due to attacks escape : @entity57 said the @entity58 ' seems intent on wiping out all traces of minority groups from areas it now controls in @entity1			2
' above , @entity63 carry their possessions to @entity25 yesterday most @entity0 in the northwestern @entity66 province fled in terror after jihadist - led militants enforcing an extreme version of sharia - or @entity8 law - launched an offensive on june 9			1
but many of the poorest families returned when the fighting stopped and @entity4 started administering the city			2
mr @entity39 said the number of @entity0 who were still in @entity2 on thursday was around 25,000			1
today , @entity57 said the @entity58 ' seems intent on wiping out all traces of minority groups from areas it now controls in @entity1			2
' journey : the mass displacement was the latest in six weeks of turmoil which has forced more than 600,000 people from their homes , left thousands dead and brought @entity1 to the brink of collapse other minorities rooted in the same province of @entity66 have suffered even more than the @entity0 , according to crimes @entity57 documented against the @entity92 , as well as the @entity94 and @entity30 communities			1
the mass displacement was the latest in six weeks of turmoil which has forced more than 600,000 people from their homes , left thousands dead and brought @entity1 to the brink of collapse			2
@entity1 's @entity0 population includes @entity104 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 communities			1
some of these are among the world 's oldest and speak a form of @entity109 , a language thought to have been spoken by @entity110			0
@entity111 - @entity101 follow eastern rites of the @entity113 , while @entity101 consider themselves @entity114			0
the @entity0 population once numbered more than a million nationwide , with upwards of 600,000 in @entity11 alone , but now there are now fewer than 400,000 across @entity1			1
this is largely because since the 2003 @entity122 - led invasion , sectarian attacks against them have been mounting			0
@entity1 is also home to a small community of @entity124			2
they are not considered @entity0 and practice one of the world 's oldest surviving @entity128 religions , but they worship @entity130 as their central prophet			2
now - executed president @entity133 's deputy prime minister @entity132 is from a @entity40 family and is one of @entity1 's best known @entity0			1
mr @entity36 's return to his native @entity26 today was likely to spark celebrations among supporters from his @entity139			2
he is widely celebrated as a skilled negotiator , who enjoys good relations with both the @entity122 and @entity142 and has repeatedly mediated between @entity1 's fractious politicians in recent years			0
but some observers warned there was little the avuncular 80 - year - old head of state could do to ease spiralling ethno - sectarian violence and rhetoric and roll back the @entity58 's expansion			0
' i really do think this is a @entity152 era			0
i 've stuck my neck out there , but i have n't heard any @entity1 talking about him in any way being president , ' said @entity158 , director of the @entity161 ' @entity160 centre			0
federal forces collapsed , in some cases abandoning uniforms and weapons in their retreat , when fighters under the command of is leader @entity169 launched their assault			0
the army has since regrouped , received intelligence , hardware and manpower from @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity30 militias , but nonetheless struggled to regain lost territory			0
security analysts have said @entity11 remains too big a target , but militants have in recent days repeatedly attacked targets that would expose the capital if captured			0
on thursday night , a jihadist commando stormed the @entity186 air base north of ex-president @entity133 's hometown of @entity188 , sparking a fierce battle			0
' last night , gunmen infiltrated the base			0
there were snipers and suicide bombers among them , they managed to reach the runway , ' an intelligence officer who survived the attack told @entity44			0
shocking : @entity4 militants were captured on video taking sledgehammers to @entity0 and @entity202 tombstones earlier this month			1
they were filmed attacking centuries - old graves in the city of @entity2 in @entity66 province attack : donning balaclavas and black coats , the militants swung sledgehammers into the old tombstones he said the pilots managed to fly all but one of the base 's aircraft to safety - but a statement posted on jihadist internet sites said many were destroyed			2
many people , including within his own @entity30 alliance that comfortably won april elections , now see prime minister @entity226 's departure as essential to national reconciliation efforts			0
in a friday sermon delivered by one of his spokesmen in @entity232 , the @entity142 - born grand ayatollah @entity235 - @entity1 's most revered @entity30 cleric - appeared to lean in the same direction			2
' the new government should have broad national acceptance and be capable of solving the crisis in the country and correcting the mistakes of the past , ' he said			0
parliamentary blocs have until sunday to submit nominees for the post of president , whose election is the next step in what has been a protracted and acrimonious process to renew @entity1 's leadership			0
despite his unexpected return , there is little expectation that mr @entity36 , who has been president since 2005 , will seek another term			0
it comes just weeks after a video emerged showing @entity4 militants taking sledgehammers to centuries - old tombstones in @entity2 in @entity66 province			1
donning balaclavas and black coats , the rebels swung sledgehammers into the tombs , causing pieces of dust and stone to fly through the air .			0
