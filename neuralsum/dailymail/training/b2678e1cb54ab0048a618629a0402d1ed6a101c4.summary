by @entity0 published : 13:50 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 13:09 est , 16 january 2014 dozens of cars left trapped by floodwater and landslides were shipped to safety aboard @entity8 landing craft yesterday , and it was all thanks to a brilliant ten - year - old boy			1
around 30 vehicles had been left stranded on a dead - end after a 20 metre stretch of road collapsed at @entity16 , @entity17 , on christmas day			1
with repairs to the flood - ravaged lane likely to take months , it seemed there was nothing that could be done , until schoolboy @entity23 came up with a plan to reach the marooned motors by water			1
@entity23 and his serviceman dad @entity41 , 44 , had attended a @entity43 carol service where the two met the @entity8 ’s commodore @entity45			1
mastermind : schoolboy @entity23 has been hailed a hero in his local community after coming up with the plan to rescue the vehicles when the @entity23 's car was stranded days later , @entity23 handed the commodore ’s card to a local councillor and suggested they borrow his boats			1
@entity57 then contacted the @entity45 and fleshed out @entity23 ’s suggestion into a full - scale rescue operation			1
ministers and disaster planners on the government ’s @entity35 - only held at times of national emergency - pored over the details before giving the mission the green light			0
@entity8 from @entity67 swung into action , launching four amphibious landing craft on the @entity40 - just as @entity23 had envisaged			1
the trapped cars were then driven down to the slipway at @entity16 - built for the @entity73 military in 1943 - before being loaded onto the boats one by one			0
they were then taken a few miles down the river to @entity77 to be unloaded and driven away by their owners			0
@entity23 lives with his dad and mum @entity81 , 37 , on scenic @entity82 , which began to subside on christmas morning and experienced a second shift later in the day			1
the collapse effectively sheared the remote village of @entity16 in two , leaving 20 homes and a row of parked cars marooned			0
five families were forced to evacuate amid fears their houses could topple into the @entity40 , which separates @entity93 and @entity17			0
residents were able to skirt around the collapsed road and walk through woodland to reach their homes and cars			0
cause : heavy rains and flooding caused a landslide on christmas day that left around 30 vehicles trapped on a dead end road a @entity8 inspects a row of vehicles left trapped after the 20 metre stretch of road collapsed at @entity16 , @entity17 action plan : @entity23 's rescue plan involved shipping the cars a few miles down the @entity40 to @entity77 but their was no way to drive them away without plunging into the river or hacking down hundreds of trees			1
@entity23 ’s mum @entity81 , a civil servant , added : ' we went down to @entity116 in @entity117 on christmas eve as my husband works down there			1
' @entity23 saw the commodore and asked if we could go up and speak to him at the end as he had never spoken to one before			1
' so we went over and had a chat with him for about 10 to 15 minutes then at the end @entity124 gave @entity23 his business card			1
' we did n’t think anything of it until christmas day when our cars and several others got stuck			1
' @entity23 came to a public meeting with me on @entity133 and he suggested to the local councillor that she called @entity124 and passed on his number			2
operation : cars are loaded aboard a @entity8 ' landing craft from an old @entity39 slipway on the @entity40 easy does it : four amphibious landing craft were able to collect the vehicles from the slipway and ferry them down the @entity40 turnout : locals wave from the riverbank as one of the cars is ferried away ' i do n’t think she could really believe it when he gave her his number			1
@entity23 has lived in @entity16 all his life and knows it very well			2
' he suggested they use the @entity8 to transport the cars - he ’s chuffed to bits and is thrilled that he ’s been able to help out with all of this			1
@entity23 , who was given the afternoon off school , was among the crowds who gathered at the banks of the @entity40 to watch the @entity8 loading the cars on to their landing crafts			1
he said : ' when i went to the service on christmas eve i spoke to the @entity45 about how @entity117 @entity168 was the biggest base in @entity170			1
after we spoke he gave me his card with his number on it - he was very nice			2
' they held a meeting in the village a few days later and weirdly i had the @entity45 ’s phone number in my pocket			2
i gave it to a councillor and then she called the @entity45 and spoke to him about it			2
rescue committee : three of the four landing craft head off along the @entity40			1
@entity23 's brilliant plan was approved at the highest level by the government 's @entity35 emergency committee on their way : the cars were taken a few miles down the river to @entity77 to be unloaded and driven away by their owners brainchild : @entity23 suggested the idea to local councilors and was even able to hand them the business card of @entity43 commodore @entity45 who he had met at a carol service that 's the ticket : proud @entity23 with the business card given to him by @entity43 commodore @entity45 ' i thought it would work really well if they got the cars onto a boat and down the river			1
the boats pass here so i see them quite a lot			0
the @entity43 are close so i thought it would be good if they could help out			2
' @entity23 , who attends @entity217 , said it was ' awesome ' that the marines had agreed to put his plan into action			1
colonel @entity222 , commanding officer of @entity67 , based at @entity116 , said the landing vehicles were normally used to carry troops			2
named after the cabinet office briefing rooms where it meets , the @entity35 , or @entity227 meets during national emergencies such as natural disasters or acts of terrorism			0
chaired by the home secretary , it is supported by the @entity234 , which forms part of the @entity236			0
its primary role is to coordinate the actions of the various bodies within the @entity241 , including local authorities , fire and rescue , the police and the armed forces			0
it will also meet to discuss events happenening in foreign countrues which are deemed to have major implications for the @entity241			0
the @entity251 has the authority to convene @entity35 whenever he feels the country is facing an emergency situation			0
examples of when the @entity35 has met include foot - and - mouth scares , the fuel crisis of 2000 and the @entity259 volcanic eruption that shut down @entity241 airspace in 2010			2
he said : ' the @entity43 is delighted to come to the aid of the civilian authorities who would normally assist the public			2
' in this case we are using @entity8 expertise in providing amphibious boats where there is no other feasible access to repatriate vehicles to the national road network			1
' my men train to conduct disaster relief around the world and while this is slightly different it is a fantastic opportunity to do some real training while helping the community in which we live			0
' @entity57 provided a fleet of hire cars for all the stranded motorists			0
they said the entire rescue operation could last as long as two days			0
cllr @entity287 said the drivers would likely have been without their vehicles for months had @entity23 not bent the @entity291 ’s ear			1
she joked : ' i doubt very much whether @entity35 had heard of @entity16 before			0
' a total of 39 vehicles will be floated to safety in a two day operation			2
@entity23 has lived in the pretty @entity298 village all his life with his parents and younger brother @entity301 , seven			0
@entity23 ’s mum @entity81 said the family had been without their @entity304 and @entity306 since @entity307 and were forced to use hire cars			0
she said : ' it ’s been a pretty expensive january as we ’ve had to rent two cars ourselves which has cost us £ 1,500			0
the council say they 're going to reimburse us , but it ’s a lot of money to pay out			0
' the family , who live on @entity82 , were able to stay in their house when the road collapsed , unlike a few of their neighbours who were forced to move out amid safety concerns			0
councillor @entity323 , responsible for @entity324 at @entity57 , said : ' @entity23 had a bright idea - he looked at the situation and used his noddle , he ’s clearly a problem solving boy			2
' he approached a couple of members of our staff and asked if the phone number would be of any help and so here we are			0
its a really good liaison between the council , the police , the community and the @entity8 .			0
