' following the sensational trial which ended in her former aides being acquitted in december 2013 , her brother @entity66 likened her treatment to the burning of heretics in the @entity72 and warned that the ' vicious ' treatment of prosecution witnesses is a threat to @entity77 justice because it could deter future witnesses from giving evidence			1
