like most football lovers @entity0 settled down last weekend to watch @entity2 against @entity3			1
his enjoyment was short lived , however			1
' i watched and tried to switch off the tv , ' he said			1
' they were on fire and i tried not to destroy my confidence ! the trouble is that on sunday the @entity12 - born @entity11 right back has the job of containing those very same players and at right back he may even have the task of marking @entity17 ; or , if not him , @entity18 ; or even @entity19 , man of the match last weekend			1
for a side struggling in the @entity22 and on their fourth manager in two years it will be some ask			1
' it 's a joy to watch @entity3 when they play like this , ' said @entity0 : except when you 're playing them , of course			1
@entity30 ( centre ) produced a man - of - the - match display as @entity3 beat @entity2 2 - 0 @entity11 defender @entity0 ( left ) will be hoping to keep @entity33 quiet in sunday 's @entity34 tie any suggestion that he might be psyched out by the prospect of facing the @entity34 holders after their 2 - 0 win at @entity2 is , however , a little foolish ; for @entity0 has a master in sports psychology , obtained from the @entity41 of @entity42 in @entity43 , where he also gained an degree in sports science , all of which was done whilst playing professionally for @entity47			1
' i did sports science for five years and afterwards i did a sports psychology masters in @entity51 , ' he said			1
' i was playing for @entity47 at the same time			1
in @entity53 that seems quite complicated but i do n't know why ? i do n't see a reason why you ca n't study and play professionally at the same time			1
' even if you are a footballer you have to have a @entity58 because careers are short : five , six , 10 years			1
and after that what ? i do n't know why in @entity53 you have to choose between being a footballer and studying something			1
it 's a terrible mistake			1
i went to school in the morning and i trained in the afternoon - i am a footballer and i have a degree			1
' @entity0 , pictured with @entity66 , has a master in sports psychology and a degree in sports science there is indeed a cultural difference , a hangover in @entity53 football from the days when education was viewed with suspicion			2
not so in @entity51 , according to @entity0 , who says that other team - mates were studying and no - one thought it strange			1
' no , i think it 's normal			2
not everyone has a degree but it 's normal to study			2
what are you going to do in the afternoon ? play @entity85 ? i do n't think that 's the best thing for anyone			2
' yet even if clubs have become much more open to the idea , with the @entity92 employing a whole department to focus on the academic education of young footballers , it is n't always enough to break down barriers			2
' i know that here ( in @entity53 ) they look after the kids to further their educations , ' said @entity0			2
' ( but ) the parents think their kids are going to be a footballer and they probably think the kids can get some money for the family			2
that 's a terrible mistake because the chances of that are so small			2
i 'm not saying that you should n't want to be a footballer , because it 's a dream come true for me , but you can do the two things at the same time and i do n't see why not			2
' my parents wanted me to study at the same time because sometimes the parents , they are the ones that say : " you have to be a footballer because you are going to earn a lot of money			2
you can help us "			2
' @entity0 , pictured against @entity119 in the @entity22 , joined @entity11 in 2010 from @entity47 in @entity51 at @entity11 , when the subject was first aired in the dressing room , it was received curiously by his team - mates			1
' it was a bit strange for them , because obviously that is the way in @entity53			2
you have to choose ( between education and football )			2
in @entity51 it was more normal than here because you can do both things			0
when i was in the ( @entity47 ) reserve team in @entity51 there were four , five , six players studying at university at the same time			0
i think it is going to make you better as a person and a footballer at the same time			0
' we have a lot of spra time and i think it 's better to use it like that rather than playing with the @entity147 – because i do n't how to use the consoles ! ' the @entity150 defender , who found his way to the south coast at @entity11 under @entity154 's managerial stint has become something of a fixture at the @entity157			1
now 33 , he is into his fifth year at the club and has the experience of having played and narrowly lost 3 - 2 to a late @entity161 goal to @entity3 at his stage of the @entity34 two years ago			1
@entity3 striker @entity163 shoots and scores during the @entity165 3 - 2 @entity34 win over @entity11 in 2013 and his psychology degree is not simply a career on which to fall back when retirement comes , he recons it helps him even now			1
when you have had bad day or you have been dropped from the team or you are a the bottom , you have to use it			0
i try as well to help the others in the team			0
you will have to ask them if they think it helps them or not but i improved a lot with the studies i did and grew as a person and footballer			0
' football managers were once resistant to the idea of psychologists in the past – but @entity11 employs one , @entity187 - she discusses new ideas with @entity0 - and most teams are open to the idea			1
' managers always say that do n't trust much in psychology but after you always see that they apply things , ' said @entity0			0
' footballers do n't like to say : ' i need to see the psychologist			0
' it 's the culture			0
hopefully in five or ten years , it 'll be normal , like you go to the physio			0
it 's like a taboo , you can not say : ' i have a problem i have to go to the psychologist			0
' it is another side to the football			0
and it 's going to make you better			0
' in other sports you have this kind of help			0
footballers are like : ' we are footballers , we do n't need that			0
' we think we are in a different world but we are in the same as everyone			0
' @entity11 boss @entity219 ( left ) will hope his side can put their poor league form to the side in the @entity34 as for @entity11 , their progress has stalled from the point at which they played @entity3 in this fixture two years ago under @entity154			1
then they had just moved into the 30,000 capacity @entity157 , set rather spectacularly in the @entity230 , and they seemed to be @entity92 bound			0
since then managers have come and gone and this season was a struggle at the bottom of @entity22 until @entity219 was appointed at the turn of the year , since when three wins from four games has lifted spirits			0
funded by professional poker player , @entity242 , the club 's infrastructure has kept pace with the upward trajectory even if the team has n't			1
the new training ground , opened last year at @entity247 , is far superior to many @entity92 facilities			0
' as a club we are more ready to be in the @entity92 , said @entity0			0
' now our position in the table means we can not be so positive as to think we can go up at the moment			0
but we are growing up as a club			0
we are in a better training ground , we are more settled in the division and i think you have to be settled in the division to go up			0
as a club we are ready to keep growing - but we have to improve in the table			1
' first there is @entity3 , of course			1
and whether @entity0 's psychological edge will help on sunday is unclear			1
@entity0 laughs when it is suggested he might put his psychological training to good use in knocking the holders out of the cup			0
' that 's a different thing , ' he said			0
' you need more than one masters degree to play against them ! '			0
