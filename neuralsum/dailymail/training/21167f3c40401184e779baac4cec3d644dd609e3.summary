the family of a 48 - year - old man have told how they rescued him from dying on the controversial @entity3 by reviving him with drops of water			1
@entity8 ’s family were told that he was severely brain damaged , had organ failure and was close to death after a cardiac arrest			1
they gathered at his bedside to say their goodbyes after the hospital withdrew fluids and said it was going to let him ‘ slip away ’			0
told he was dying : the family of @entity8 ( pictured with daughter @entity20 ) were told he was severely brain damaged , had organ failure and close to death after a cardiac arrest but they rescued him from dying after he showed signs that he had not had severe brain damage but when mr @entity8 ’s sister , who is a nurse , gently moved him to change his bloodstained sheets , he started to murmur words , showing signs that he had not suffered severe brain damage			1
then , as she cleaned his face with a wet cloth , he desperately tried to suck in the moisture			0
the family continued their vigil at his bedside around the clock , concerned that doctors did not want to keep the patient alive			2
every ten minutes they gave him drops of water that helped him start to come round before doctors eventually agreed to put him back on a drip			1
mr @entity8 recovered and returned home			2
he lived for another month and was able to properly say farewell to his loved ones			0
his sisters last night called the @entity3 a ‘ licence to kill ’			1
it can involve withdrawing treatment and the heavy sedation of a patient and removal of tubes providing food and fluid in the last 24 hours of their life			0
' @entity64 ' : sister @entity65 called the @entity3 a ' licence to kill ' devised in the 1990s as a means of easing pain for the dying , it has been in widespread use in the @entity72 in recent years			1
however , critics claim it is increasingly being applied to patients without their families ’ knowledge and when they still have a chance of recovery			0
@entity65 , 53 , last night said her brother had been put on the @entity3 , which she describes as ‘ insidious and a licence to kill ’ , long before he was ‘ ready to go ’			1
she said the hospital had chosen to ‘ give up ’ on mr @entity8 , a father of five and grandfather of two who had been a carpenter			2
mr @entity8 , who was suffering from pancreatic cancer , was admitted to the @entity87 in @entity88 in the early hours of june 19 after he had a cardiac arrest			1
when miss @entity65 arrived at the hospital she was told that he was very ill , that his organs were shutting down and that they had taken all of the tubes from him			1
she said : ‘ they told us that he had not got long to live and that the kindest thing to do would be to let him slip away			2
we did not know that they had instituted the @entity3			2
‘ they mentioned something about a care pathway , but we did n’t perceive for a second that it was a way to kill people			2
‘ in the evening my sister , who is a qualified nurse , arrived from @entity105			0
she was angry because no one had taken care of his basic needs			0
the bed he was in was dirty and covered with blood			0
‘ she asked if she could change the sheets and when she asked @entity8 questions , such as if they could roll him on his side , he replied with “ yes ” and started to open his eyes			2
‘ that is when she began to suspect he had not been brain damaged			0
when she used a wet cloth to clean his face he tried to suck the moisture			0
we started to give him water from pipettes ourselves and he gradually became more awake			0
but we still had to campaign for the doctors to put him back on a drip			1
’ the family also found mr @entity8 ’s medical notes were marked with ‘ do not resuscitate ’ , despite this never being discussed with them			1
miss @entity65 added : ‘ we stayed with him around the clock , because we were scared they were going to try to kill him again			2
admitted : mr @entity8 , who was suffering from pancreatic cancer , was admitted to @entity87 ( pictured ) after he had a cardiac arrest ‘ he was terrified of the doctors and at one point told his consultant himself , “ you tried to kill me and told my family that i wanted to die ”			1
he went home at the end of june and lived for another month until july 25			0
’ mr @entity8 ’s other sister @entity142 , 57 , who has worked as a nurse for 39 years , said : ‘ we had another five weeks with our brother – that time was very important for us and everyone else in the family			1
‘ even when @entity8 had started to come round we had to beg the doctor to put him back on a drip and he told us that our brother did not like needles and that he was sure that he would n’t want to be put back on a drip			1
‘ i think it ’s very difficult for relatives to comprehend what ’s going on when they ’re in state of shock , grieving and hurting			0
people just listen to doctors and respect them and i ’m not saying perhaps at the very end that it might not be appropriate , but who knows when that end stage is			0
’ last night a hospital spokesman said : ‘ this case is subject to an official complaint and we are unable to comment at this time			0
