the detectives failed to investigate complaints against their colleague detective constable @entity3 , 42 , and instead used ‘ repulsive language and poked fun ’ at his victims			1
the @entity17 was called in after @entity19 family liaison officer @entity3 was later jailed for three years for taking advantage of the women , who were victims of domestic abuse			1
both women complained about @entity3 , but the @entity17 found his senior officers ignored this			1
instead they made ‘ lewd ’ and ‘ sexual ’ remarks about them in official emails - and even made up an office quiz based on their complaints			2
one officer ‘ poked fun ’ at a woman allegedly flashed at by @entity3			1
detective inspector @entity36 and detective sergeant @entity37 were both found guilty of gross misconduct after five - day disciplinary hearing			1
the force has sacked both of them			0
@entity17 commissioner @entity43 said : ‘ the women were not treated as victims of a sexual offence and their allegations were not investigated effectively			1
‘ the investigation also revealed a @entity50 unit pervaded with what could be described as a canteen culture where inappropriate comments and behaviour were viewed as harmless banter			0
‘ the language demonstrated in emails and documents was , in fact , grossly unprofessional , offensive and demonstrated a lack of respect for the women complaining			2
‘ i read with a sense of repulsion the sexual content of comments made by detective sergeant @entity37 , both in his emails and in the two documents found on his computer			1
’ base : detective sergeant @entity37 was @entity3 's line manager and detective inspector @entity36 his supervisor at @entity78 police station ( pictured ) in @entity79 she added : ‘ the allegations made against @entity3 were extremely serious and should have been treated that way			1
‘ they were vulnerable women who had turned to the police for help and had found themselves subjected to an appalling abuse of trust			2
‘ their dreadful experience was then further compounded by the inactions of @entity3 ’s supervisors who failed to deal properly with the criminal allegations against him			1
’ @entity37 deleted offensive emails when he discovered the @entity17 were investigating			1
and @entity36 lied to the @entity17 when he was being interviewed about the handling of the allegations made by two complainants , known only as @entity95 and @entity96 det sgt @entity37 was @entity3 ’s line manager and @entity97 his supervisor at @entity78 police station in @entity79			1
unimpressed : @entity17 commissioner @entity43 said the women 's allegations ' were not investigated effectively ' the @entity17 investigation discovered a ‘ canteen culture ’ in the @entity50 unit where officers joked about victims of the sexual assaults in 2011			1
chief constable of @entity19 @entity110 said : ‘ from myself to our front - line officers of @entity19 are shocked and feel deeply let down by the behaviour of these officers			2
‘ let us be in no doubt , we owe the women affected a sincere apology as the conduct of these officers fell well short of the standards i expect from @entity19			2
‘ as part of the investigation into their conduct a number of offensive and inappropriate emails and documents came to light which were prepared by @entity129 and seen by @entity130 , who failed to challenge them			0
‘ i have to make it clear that this is behaviour i simply do n’t recognise within @entity19			0
we have examined thousands of emails to see if such behaviour was more common			0
‘ quite simply it is not and evidently , the vast majority of our 5,000 officers and staff know that there is absolutely no place for lewd and offensive communication and it will not be tolerated			0
‘ everyone throughout @entity19 knows the values and standards which are expected from them , we train them in these standards and on promotion			0
‘ i tell every manager that they have an absolute duty to challenge inappropriate behaviour and conduct			0
‘ sergeant @entity37 and inspector @entity36 failed to act in the professional manner that i expect of my officers			1
their dismissals show that we will always be robust when it comes to staff misconduct			0
‘ at the same time , every year our front - line staff and specialist teams support hundreds of victims of sexual offences			0
‘ leaders across the force are ensuring that we do our very best to protect vulnerable people and respond to their needs			0
’ @entity36 failed to refer the complaint of indecent exposure by ‘ @entity173 ’ to the professional standards department and did not treat her as a victim of a sexual offence			2
he was also found guilty of failing to carry out an effective investigation and treated the allegation as a malicious complaint			1
det sgt @entity37 failed to refer ‘ woman a ’s ’ complaint of indecent assault to the professional standards department			2
the @entity17 investigation found the women ’s allegations were not reported to the professional standards department of @entity19			1
commissioner @entity43 said they were ‘ littered with lewd language ’ and showed a total lack of empathy and respect for a victim who had shown ‘ real courage ’ to report an allegation of indecent exposure against a police officer			0
she said : ‘ he treated her complaint as sport , to be used as part of a quiz with colleagues outside work			0
this was outrageous and demonstrates the contempt in which the woman and her allegation was held			0
‘ detective sergeant @entity37 then tried to hide the evidence of his behaviour by deleting documents from his computer when he became aware of our investigation			2
‘ inspector @entity36 failed to challenge his team ’s behaviour and lied to the @entity17 during an interview			1
it is only right that these officers have been dismissed			0
‘ their failure to challenge inappropriate behaviour strikes at the heart of confidence in policing and tarnishes the good work done by officers every day			0
’ the @entity17 met with woman a and @entity173 last week to share the findings of the report with them and explained the officers had been sacked			2
commissioner @entity43 said : ‘ it is vitally important that other officers are confident that they will be supported if they challenge inappropriate behaviour			0
‘ victims of crime must also feel that they can have confidence to speak to an officer , and be treated with dignity and respect			0
