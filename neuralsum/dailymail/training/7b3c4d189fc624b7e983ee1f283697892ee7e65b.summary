by @entity0 as an owner of a curiosity shop , @entity1 thought she had seen most unusual items , until a customer brought in a mummified cat and rat - both over 300 years old			1
she was stunned when the seller opened a box to reveal the ancient pair , which had been found sealed into the walls of an old @entity13 cottage			0
the cat , which is in recognisable shape and still has its claws and teeth , may have been placed in the wall while still alive to ward - off bad luck			1
not a normal sale : @entity1 who runs @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , could n't believe her eyes when the macabre looking specimen was brought in by someone looking to sell it on preserved : the mummified animal is thought to be over 300 years old and was found behind the wall of a cottage in @entity13 buried alive : the cat , which is in recognisable shape and still has its claws and teeth , may have been placed in the walls of the house while alive to ward off evil spirits dr @entity37 , a witchcraft and folklore expert from @entity40 , said hundreds of years ago cats were put into walls to ward - off ' bad luck			1
' dr @entity37 told @entity46 news : ' cats were often put into walls as some kind of good luck charm			2
' they seem to be designed to keep away witches , the evil eye , bad luck , vermin , anything that can be seen as a threat to the house			1
' ' it does seem to have been quite a widespread practice across the @entity62 continent			2
they have been found in several places across the @entity65			0
last december , a cat was found sealed into the walls of a 17th century cottage , in @entity69 , the looming @entity71 landmark which for 400 years has been a notorious centre of witchcraft			2
in 2009 , builders working at a house in a @entity76 village have found the remains of a cat , hidden in a wall			1
the owner of the house said the cat would be put back where it was found			1
it is a practice which was widespread across @entity62 centuries ago			1
mrs @entity1 who runs @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , promptly purchased the macabre offerings , and has put them on display in her window			1
it is unknown how much she paid for the pair , but she said they have so far caused a mixed reaction with her customers			0
' some people think they ’re wonderful , others are shocked , ' she said			0
' but there ’s been plenty of interest in them			0
' the hope is that a museum might want them and put them on display			0
' it ’s not unheard of for cats to have been hidden behind walls			0
' but i ’m not sure about the rat - he may have just got trapped there			2

' unlucky rat : it is thought the rat , found near the cat , may just have been buried behind the wall by accident on display : mrs @entity1 said they had caused a mixed reaction since going on display in her shop			1

although the cat is thought to have been left there as recently as 1800 , it nevertheless offers a tantalising link to the area ’s notorious past – not least for the local tourism industry , which makes great play of the @entity69 witches			0
the discovery was made by water engineers from @entity158 on a routine construction project close to a local reservoir			0

@entity1 who owns a curiosity shop in @entity171 , @entity22 , could *n’t* believe her eyes when the macabre looking specimen was brought in
sealing a cat into a wall while still alive dates back centuries in a practice believed to ward - off bad luck
