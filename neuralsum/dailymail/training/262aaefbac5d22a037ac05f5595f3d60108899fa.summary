@entity1 's arrival at @entity2 on deadline day created more excitement and headlines than any other transfer in the last window , including @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
but the £ 3.8million wages - on top of a £ 6m loan fee - shelled out so far on the @entity14 loanee have yielded just one goal , and the @entity18 needs to prove his worth if he wants a permanent move			1
@entity2 have until april to make up their minds and while @entity1 wants to stay at @entity21 , is he worth an additional £ 43m transfer fee when they already have @entity23 , @entity24 and emerging teenager @entity25 in the dressing - room ? @entity1 takes a free - kick against in @entity2 's 3 - 0 win over @entity29 @entity1 ( left , holding off @entity30 ) failed to score against @entity29 , extending his barren run @entity1 ( left ) was again a second - half substitute for @entity2 , coming on for @entity25 ( right ) joined : september 1 , 2014 cost : £ 6m loan fee wages : £ 265,000 - per - week appearances : 8 starts : 3 goals : 1 cost per goal in fees : £ 6m cost per goal in wages : £ 3.8m total cost per goal : £ 9.75m nobody doubts @entity1 's talent			1
anyone who watched his brilliant hat - trick for @entity47 against @entity48 in the 2012 @entity49 is aware this he is one of the world 's outstanding centre forwards			0
' he is the best striker in the world and it is a pleasure to have him			0
it 's a luxury for us , ' said @entity47 's @entity56 at the time after @entity1 had destroyed @entity48 's renowned back four			2
but a serious knee injury sustained in january while playing for @entity14 forced the 28 - year - old to miss the @entity59 and while he appears to be over that problem , other niggles have occurred , most notably a calf problem , since he has arrived at @entity2			1
it often happens to players returning after a long period but until @entity1 starts hitting the back of the net with regularity , @entity2 ca n't be absolutely certain he remains the superstar player of two years ago			1
@entity1 has started only three matches in his three - and - a - half months at @entity2			1
@entity70 says with all his injury problems , match sharpness has been a problem			0
@entity1 has spent much of his time at @entity2 sitting on the substitutes bench @entity1 has scored just once for @entity2 - against @entity76 in october @entity1 celebrates scoring his one and only goal for @entity2 against @entity76 @entity2 4 - 0 @entity79 ( september 14 ) - 67th minute substitute @entity81 ( september 21 ) - started game and played 72 minutes @entity2 2 - 1 @entity83 ( september 27 ) - started game and played 65 minutes @entity2 2 - 1 @entity76 ( october 5 ) - started and played 73 minutes			1
@entity85 2 - 2 @entity2 ( october 20 ) - 72nd minute substitute @entity2 1 - 1 @entity48 ( october 26 ) - injured @entity87 1 - 0 @entity2 ( november 2 ) - injured @entity2 1 - 0 @entity88 ( november 8 ) - injured @entity89 1 - 2 @entity2 ( november 22 ) - injured @entity2 3 - 0 @entity91 ( november 29 ) - 70th minute substitute @entity2 2 - 1 @entity92 ( december 2 ) - 78th minute substitute @entity94 1 - 2 @entity2 ( december 8 ) - unused substitute @entity2 3 - 0 @entity29 ( december 14 ) - 78th minute substitute overall : three starts , five substitute appearances , one goal			1
' @entity1 needs match fitness			2
he can only play for 20 minutes , ' said the @entity101 last week			0
' i have selected him despite that but the rhythm of the game in the @entity106 is the highest			0
' ideally , @entity70 wants to give him a run - out in the under 21s development squad but may still be tempted to use him at @entity109 on saturday			0
with @entity2 scheduled to play seven games in the next month , he will get his opportunity at some stage			2
you may wonder having read all that why @entity2 opted to bring in @entity1 in the first place given they were spoilt for choice up front anyway			1
if they had n't signed him , they would have kept @entity117 in any case as a fourth striker			0
but @entity1 , fully fit and firing , is a special breed			2
when transfer fees of £ 60m are quoted for @entity125 's @entity124 , it 's easy to forget that @entity1 is probably the quicker , stronger and deadlier finisher of the two			2
his only @entity2 goal so far , the winner against @entity76 in a 2 - 1 victory in october , gave a glimpse of his instinctive anticipation in the penalty area			2
@entity10 's mis - hit shot was heading wide until @entity1 , in line with the last defender , managed to reach it with his right leg and divert the ball past @entity140 in a flash			2
it was marksmanship of the highest order			0
@entity1 sees his shot at goal saved by @entity79 's @entity147 @entity148 wants to play if @entity2 could guarantee @entity1 doing that 30 times a season , he would be worth the money			1
but that is the difficulty so far – he has n't shown that guarantee – and the renaissance of @entity154 , with four goals in his last four games , means it is crowded for the coveted no 9 position in the team			0
even @entity25 from the academy was given a start ahead of @entity1 for last weekend 's 3 - 0 win against @entity29			1
@entity1 is also on top , a-list wages - around £ 265,000 - a - week , and the transfer fee to @entity14 would put a dent even in @entity2 's considerable coffers			1
of course , they could afford it , but they will only want to pay out £ 40m - plus on two or three players in the summer , not four or five			0
@entity170 remains their gold - star target if the @entity172 shows any signs of tiring of @entity47			0
@entity1 has told boss @entity175 ( centre left ) that he is now fit and ready to play a bigger part for @entity2 @entity1 arrived to huge fan fare on deadline day , along with @entity180 @entity2 have not given up on @entity1 – he is too good for that			1
but there are choices to be made			0
@entity70 is not the type of manager to be blinded by reputation , as you 'd expect for someone who has helped develop the careers of @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192			0
@entity1 , who said this week he ' really wants to stay ' at @entity2 beyond the summer will have to deliver on merit to make that happen			1
' i hope it will work out			0
that is clear , i think , ' said @entity70 recently			0
' because of the ( knee ) injury , maybe we did n't buy him			0
we have him on loan but do you think that we expected he would be so many weeks injured ( with other knocks ) ? ' judgement day may be approaching for @entity1 .			1

@entity1 arrived on loan from @entity14 on deadline - day for £ 6m
@entity2 striker has *struggled* with injuries but *insists* he is now 100 *%* fit and ready to play
@entity25 has been preferred to the @entity18 by @entity175
@entity1 : i really want to stay at @entity2 and i *'m* ready to play
