@entity1 went by the pseudonym @entity3 , and @entity4 used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the @entity7 to plan her daughter 's wedding , a new report has revealed			1
at the center of the controversy is @entity4 's email account - @entity13 , which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a @entity15 committee to join newly elected president @entity17 's cabinet			1
the @entity18 reports that @entity19 used the address for everything from official government business to matters relating to the @entity24 , and the @entity7 confirmed on wednesday that was @entity19 's only email alias during her tenure in the @entity17 administration			1
news articles detailing the former secretary of state 's arrangement to have her government correspondence run through a private domain name and self - run server have set off alarms about the possibility of her sensitive communications being hacked or destroyed			1
a news report reveled that @entity43 used to go by the pseudonym of @entity3 , and @entity4 used the same email account that was dedicated to her work at the @entity7 to plan her daughter 's wedding at least one of @entity4 's longtime aides , @entity52 , who is still on @entity19 's payroll , had one of the coveted @entity56 addresses , as well , the @entity18 reports			1
in the beginning , @entity1 used the same domain name for her email address , under the name @entity3 , which the @entity18 says she also gave to hotels when she checked in , but switched over to chelseaoffice.com at the urging of the family 's advisers			2
concerned that @entity4 could appear too closely tied with the @entity24 if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family , @entity19 ran his email through @entity68			1
the @entity70 ' server was run out of their @entity72 , @entity46 , home			2
according to @entity74 , they transferred it to a commercial provider , @entity77 , after @entity4 departed the @entity7			0
the @entity56 domain name was originally registered to @entity19 confidante @entity79 , the @entity18 discovered			1
@entity80 is the same aide who was charged with packing up and carting off furniture from the @entity83 at the end of @entity19 's presidency that he said was ' @entity19 ’s personal property			1
' the furnishings were later determined to be government property , however , and the @entity70 were required to pay $ 86,000 in restitution for the items they kept			1
others , they had to return			0
@entity80 now works in finance in @entity95 , and another former @entity19 staffer 's name is on the server registration - @entity99			1
it is set to expire in 2017 , when @entity4 would theoretically take office if she were to compete for and win the presidency next year			2
@entity99 has also since left the employment of the @entity70 for @entity103 , a firm managed by a former @entity19 adviser @entity104			2
in a tweet late on wednesday , the likely @entity106 presidential candidate said she asked the @entity7 to release the 55,000 pages emails she turned over			0
a @entity7 official told @entity110 on wednesday , though , that ' the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set ' the @entity70 are pictured here at a conference for their family foundation in september			2
@entity4 became a name partner in the endeavor after she left the @entity7 in 2013			0
@entity1 at one time used the same domain name for her emails as her mother			0
concerned that @entity4 could appear too closely tied with the @entity24 while at @entity7 if she used the same domain name as the rest of her family , @entity43 migrated to chelseaoffice.com and @entity19 ran his email through @entity68 while the email addresses of all secretaries of state before @entity133 doubled as both their personal and professional points of contact , @entity19 's deliberate decision to keep her exchanges out of the reach of the federal government has come under intense scrutiny			1
the @entity83 and the @entity7 have been careful to state that to their knowledge , all of @entity19 's emails have been secured , and additional questions should be directed at @entity19 and her team			1
a spokesman for @entity19 has said that the top - ranking diplomat transmitted all of government - related communications to the @entity7 , but no proof positive of that assertion exists			1
a security expert who spoke to @entity150 warned that in maintaining her own server , @entity19 retains the power to wipe all of her data without a trace			2
' you erase it and everything ’s gone , ' @entity158 , the president & ceo of global cybersecurity firm @entity161 , said			0
another expert , threat intelligence analyst @entity162 told @entity74 that @entity19 's encryption system was misconfigured and could be hacked			1
@entity165 and @entity167 chairman @entity166 said wednesday of the debacle that , ' it does beg the question : were there any sort of classified pieces of information that were flowing through her personal email account ? ' comparing the disclosure to that of former @entity179 chief @entity178 , who plead guilty this week to mishandling classified information , @entity166 pointed out that sharing classified information over email '' with somebody who did n't have a classification ' is a crime			1
a @entity7 spokeswoman said wednesday there 's ' no indication that @entity4 used her personal e-mail account for anything but unclassified purposes , ' however			2
instead , @entity19 had her staff print out classified documents for her or discussed that information over secure phone and video conference calls			0
at the center of the controversy is @entity4 's email account - @entity13 , which was set up a day before she was confirmed in 2009 by a @entity15 committee to join newly elected president @entity17 's cabinet			1
the two are seen here at an october 2008 rally on wednesday evening @entity19 made her first public comments on the fracas			0
she wrote on @entity205 : ' i want the public to see my email			0
i asked @entity7 to release them			0
they said they will review them for release as soon as possible			0
' secretary of state @entity133 confirmed on thursday while in @entity214 , @entity215 that the department ' will undertake this task as rapidly as possible in order to make sure that we are dealing with the sheer volume in a responsible way			0
' a @entity7 official told @entity110 on wednesday , though , that ' the review is likely to take several months given the sheer volume of the document set			0
' @entity19 's team turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the @entity7			2
@entity229 are n't convinced that her entire body of work was disclosed , however , and they 're calling for investigations into the matter			2
a special @entity235 exclusively focused on auditing the executive branch 's response to the 2012 @entity239 terror attack is subpoenaing emails from @entity19 's personal account			1
and the @entity242 asked the @entity7 's inspector general on thursday insisting it launch an examination of its own to ensure that @entity19 followed the law			0
@entity246 , a conservative watchdog group , accused @entity19 on thursday of ' selectively ' turning over her correspondence to @entity7 , which it said is ' disingenuous and entirely inadequate			0
' @entity19 's request that @entity7 make public her emails ' does nothing to address the key questions of whether official communications were deleted or whether sensitive classified information was put at risk , ' the group 's executive director , @entity250 , said in a statement			1
' @entity262 deserve a full investigation into whether evidence exists that official communications were n't being reported for public records , but there may be no way to know for sure , ' @entity261 said			0
' this is exactly why this kind of behavior is against the law			0
it belies the spirit of openness and transparency in government			0
it keeps the public in the dark , and it raises serious national security concerns			0
