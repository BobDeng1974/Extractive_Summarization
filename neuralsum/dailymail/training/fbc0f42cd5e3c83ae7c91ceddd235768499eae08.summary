by @entity1 reporter published : 16:14 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 16:45 est , 19 june 2013 lucky that these school kids ca n't vote ! @entity4 governor told students at a school in the state that he 's a @entity8 fan			2
while talking to students at @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity4 , governor @entity12 was asked which teams he supports			2
he revealed that he roots for the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17			0
' my favorite football team is not the @entity24			0
' there was a stir in the assembly hall at hearing the news			0
' it is not the @entity23 ... and it is not the @entity41 , ' @entity12 continued with the students on tenterhooks			1
little chat : the governor had already admitted to being a fan of the @entity8 -- as well as the more locally acceptable @entity16 , @entity15 and @entity17 -- back in 2010 glory supporter ? of course , there are plenty of other reasons why the governor may be a keen supporter of the @entity8 ... ' get ready now			0
my favorite football team are the @entity8 ... which by the way is not the smartest thing for the @entity55 to want to be is a fan of the @entity8			0
' there was uproar in the hall and the students booed loudly			0
governor @entity12 could only shake his head as he listened in amusement			2
the governor explained that his father was a @entity24 fan but he grew up a fan of the @entity8 and @entity67			1
' the @entity24 and the @entity23 pretty much stunk when i was a kid , ' @entity12 said			1
' and my father was a @entity24 fan and i used to remember watching him when i was eight , nine - years - old			0
every sunday , he would watch the @entity24 and yell at the tv set			1
i used to think to myself , why would i want to root for a team that makes you angry ? so i decided not to and the @entity8 were really good back then			1
' @entity12 's support of an out - of - state team may lead some to question how much he values loyalty in his life			1
many republicans took issue with the fact that @entity12 met with and praised president @entity81 just days before the 2012 election after @entity83 hit			1
@entity12 , a popular governor widely seen as a possible @entity85 contender in 2016 , frustrated some in the @entity88 campaign who feared he had given what was a critical boost to @entity81 , a @entity91			1
' if the president of @entity93 comes here and he 's willing to help my people and he does it then i 'm gon na say nice things about him because he 's earned it			0
' ' @entity81 provided help to my people at one of the worst crises that this state has ever faced , ' @entity12 added			2
' when somebody does a good job , they deserve credit			0

governor : ' the @entity24 and the @entity23 pretty much stunk when i was a kid , '
' my father used to yell at the tv set so i followed the @entity24 who were good back then '
will lead many to question @entity12 's loyalty once again after he backed president @entity81 in the wake of @entity83 prior to the 2012 election
