by @entity0 published : 17:18 est , 2 february 2014 @entity2 : 02:55 est , 3 february 2014 paying the price : @entity4 with her charity shop ' bargains ' from the contents of my shopping basket , you ’d think i ’d just hit the end of the january sales			1
a cosy @entity15 jacket for £ 25 , a red gap top for £ 7.99 , a @entity18 frock for £ 25 and a @entity20 handbag for £ 40			2
but , in fact , these are some of the price tags on the clothes rails of a few local charity shops near my home in @entity28			1
what would be a bargain haul for discounted new clothes is arguably rather a high price for someone else ’s cast - offs			2
certainly , the days are gone when you could pick up second - hand clothing for a couple of quid			2
in the stores i visited , i found dresses for £ 50 and £ 60 , tops for £ 14.99 and worn shoes for £ 20 , not to mention handbags from shops such as @entity44 and @entity45 that were almost as much to buy second hand as they would be new			1
in one @entity48 store , i dressed myself from top to toe in labels from a powder - blue @entity53 cardigan to a black evening dress with sparkly waistband by @entity56 — but the total came to more than £ 100			1
perhaps no wonder , then , that charity shops stand accused of abandoning their traditional clientele			1
many shoppers believe they are turning into boutiques — with prices to match			0
so , why have charity shops suddenly become so much more expensive ? there ’s certainly more of them than ever before			1
according to the latest statistics , they outnumber shoe shops in @entity70 , having increased by 30 per cent over the past five years			1
as their number increases , many high streets , like the @entity74 in @entity75 , pictured , now have numerous charity shops this boom is changing the face of our towns			1
@entity75 @entity74 in @entity28 , for example , has 12 charity shops in one short stretch — and that includes two branches of @entity86 that are almost facing each other			1
while many independent shops and established chains are having a hard time of it , charity shops — staffed by volunteers and benefiting from free stock and business rate discounts — are able to expand			1
take @entity96 ’s , whose profits from its 538 shops have increased from just £ 1.8 million five years ago to £ 10.9 million in 2012/13			1
no wonder it has plans to open 87 more shops in 2014/15			2
@entity48 reported sales of £ 90 million in 2011 , an all - time record , and 5 per cent higher than the previous year			1
in one @entity48 store , @entity4 dressed herself from top to toe in labels from a powder - blue @entity53 cardigan to a black evening dress with sparkly waistband by @entity56 ¿ but the total came to more than £ 100 ‘ the charity shop sector is going well and growing , ’ says @entity115 , head of policy and public affairs at the @entity118			1
‘ it is partly to do with the economic climate and attracting new audiences — some one million more people			0
’ but as this investigation reveals , it may well be consumers who are paying the price for this success			0
no one would deny the importance of the money raised by the shops — £ 220 million a year			1
nor would anyone want to knock the sterling work of the thousands of volunteers who staff the shops			0
but it does seem ironic that at a time when we are all feeling the pinch , many charity shops are more expensive than @entity142			1
the hike in prices is certainly a hot topic of debate online , with consumers noticing a change as charity shops increasingly market themselves to a more well - heeled clientele			1
gone are the days when clothes were a ragtag assortment of sizes and colours			0
now , many shops are colour coded , @entity74 labels are prominently displayed and prices are marked accordingly higher			0
on one internet forum , a former volunteer reveals that she was put under pressure to put high price tags on good labels			0
‘ they have got very , very greedy , ’ she confides			0
three clothes boutiques have closed down over the past 18 months , but the number of charity shops has increased to four			1
clothes in the @entity48 branch are beautifully presented and there ’s a smattering of high - end @entity74 labels and a few designer numbers			1
but they do n’t come that cheap			0
my eye is drawn to a @entity180 skirt priced at £ 5.99 , which is n’t bad			0
but the @entity182 polka dot blouse beside it is £ 7.99			0
there are similar chiffon tops in the next sale for £ 8 and even a full - price , new blouse starts at around £ 20			2
then there ’s an evening dress for £ 50 by a designer i ’d never heard of and a glitzy sequin number for £ 60			1
the dress was elegant and in good condition — but £ 60 for a dress in a provincial charity shop ? that seems excessive when you bear in mind that it cost the charity shop nothing in the first place			2
the accessories are just as pricey			0
i found two rather worn @entity206 handbags for £ 15			0
you can buy a brand - new one for just £ 15 more			2
as i ’m working my way through the rails , i hear a customer sigh : ‘ is it me or is everything in here £ 20 ? ’ to which the sales assistant replies : ‘ not everything			2
’ @entity96 's profits from its 538 shops have increased from just £ 1.8 ¿ million five years ago to £ 10.9 ¿ million in 2012/13			1
no wonder it has plans to open 87 more shops in 2014/15 but there were few bargains to be had			0
the only ones i saw were on a small sale rail where a lurid and well - worn floral @entity227 top originally priced at £ 6.99 was £ 1			2
a few doors down , in a shop that raises money for a hospice , some of the prices were a little more reasonable , but i still found @entity18 dresses for £ 20 , when new ones are only £ 40			0
in @entity237 , the prices are even steeper			0
in the @entity241 branch of @entity48 , a @entity239 black blazer is on sale for £ 32			1
a new equivalent would be £ 45			0
there ’s also an @entity246 silk tunic shirt for £ 19			2
other blouses are on sale in @entity246 for a full price of £ 19.99 — just 99p more			0
there are some designer finds that are true bargains — a purple three - quarter - length sleeve @entity256 dress for £ 45 and a @entity258 black tunic at £ 45			2
but in every charity shop i go to the @entity74 labels are hugely marked up			0
one has a black bodycon dress from @entity263 for a staggering £ 95			0
@entity264 , 46 , a full - time mum from @entity237 , told me : ‘ i know it ’s for charity , but the shops are pricing people out			1
’ in a @entity48 , a white @entity142 cardigan is £ 12 , the same price it was @entity271 expert @entity272 says : ‘ the old way was to sell incredibly cheaply , more like a jumble sale , but there has been a huge trend shift as people have realised that the second - hand clothes market can be lucrative , ’ she says			1
‘ charities want to get the best price they can for their donations			0
’ in other words , if the charities do n’t mark up the prices , someone else will			0
after all , there are profits to be made on @entity289 and in vintage shops			2
an @entity48 spokesman said : ‘ we believe the best way to thank our donors for their generosity is to get the best price we can for their donations			2
each shop team uses their judgment to decide prices in their location			0
‘ customers know their money will be well spent to help the world ’s poorest people			0
’ but science teacher @entity303 , 50 , is not impressed after popping into the @entity48 store on @entity305 where there is a @entity308 dress for £ 50 , the same price as new			1
she says : ‘ i ’ll still donate to charity , but i ’d rather go to @entity311 than spend that much money here			0
