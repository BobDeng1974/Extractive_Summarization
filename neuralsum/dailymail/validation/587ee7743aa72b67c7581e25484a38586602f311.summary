@entity1 driver @entity0 has been warned by the @entity2 he must stop driving the moment he suffers a repeat of the back pain that forced him out of the @entity8 @entity7			1
@entity0 sustained a very small tear in the annular part of a disc in his lower back during qualifying , leading to severe pain			1
although the @entity14 made himself available to drive on sunday morning ahead of the race , the @entity2 ultimately declared him unfit			2
@entity0 briefs the press about his injury at the @entity18 on thursday @entity0 declared himself fit for @entity19 after suffering a back injury in qualifying , but still missed the race ahead of sunday 's race in @entity23 , @entity0 has now been given the all clear , albeit with the proviso from the @entity2 that ' in case of a recurrence of pain , or any abnormal feeling , he must stop at the earliest opportunity '			1
@entity0 has no doubt he will come through unscathed as he said : ' the back is good , no pain , which is nice			1
' at the end of last week i could do something without any pain , and during the weekend i could swim , cross-train without any pain , so the recovery was really good			0
' we 've done everything we can in this short period of time - luckily there are two weeks - so i feel confident of getting back in the car			0
' @entity0 has revealed the injury was due to his brake and seat position inside his car , which have since been corrected			1
' the back is now in a more neutral position , less pressure on the discs			0
we are confident that should be it , ' added @entity0			1
preparations are ramping up in @entity55 ahead of the @entity23 @entity7 @entity57 director @entity56 ( right ) speaks with @entity0 in the paddock in @entity55 ' i 've never had any problems before with the lower back			1
that kind of thing normally takes a bit of time to build up			0
' but there was no warning , it went suddenly under maximum braking			0
it was like someone putting a knife in there , with the pain ramping up through to midnight			2
' during the night it started to ease off			0
in the morning i would have been ready to race			0
' i did pass the tests , but the @entity2 had access to all the material from the hospital , from the mri and that stuff			0
' maybe they thought it was better ( not to race ) in the longer term , which could have been true			0
' it was very disappointing , but i also respect the @entity2 's decision , with the support great from the team			0
' as a precaution , @entity1 on thursday announced @entity89 as their reserve driver , with the @entity93 back in @entity94 after being axed by @entity95 at the end of last year			1
although @entity97 is test driver and young @entity99 @entity98 the development driver , @entity1 believe experience is crucial should a sudden change be required			1
sir @entity1 said : ' the fight for a top constructors ' championship position will be intense this season			2
