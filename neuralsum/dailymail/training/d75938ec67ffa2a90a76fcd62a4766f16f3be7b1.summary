it 's a cruel , horrible , nasty thing to do			0
how anybody could shoot a defenceless animal in its eye with a crossbow is unbelievable			2
' i got to the field and saw the crossbow just sticking out of her eye			0
' i did n't want the crossbow to catch on anything like a hedge and pull her whole eyeball out , so i yanked the crossbow out of the cow 's eye			1
' we gave her antibiotics and some painkillers to keep her calm			2
' i spoke to the vet straight away and someone came out to look at her last night , and they 've said that she seems to be okay			0
she will lose the sight in that eye , though			0
recovery : farmer @entity10 said he left the cow in the field with her friends to avoids any further distress while she recovers the crossbow bolt was fully embedded in the cow 's eye socket and mr @entity10 pulled it out himself ' we 're just going to keep a close eye on her and see she 's okay			1
' we 've left her in the field with her friends , as there are five cows altogether , and we thought it would distress her less if we kept things normal			0
' these cows are part of a conservation grazing programme in conjunction with @entity75			1
' they 're on the land to graze rough grass down to make the ground more friendly for birds and other wildlife , to prevent it going back to scrub land			0
' @entity84 , a walker who found the cow , said : ' who in their right mind would shoot an animal with a crossbow ? it 's ridiculous ' the cow is one of a small protected herd grazing land as part of a wildlife conservation programme mr @entity10 , who is the farmer responsible for the animals on behalf of @entity100 , added : ' we 've never had anything like this happen with cattle			1
i want everyone involved in this , the @entity108 and the police			0
' @entity84 , a walker who found the cow , said : ' in the past the cattle have been chased by dogs and all sorts , and now it 's got a crossbow bolt in its eye			1
' who in their right mind would shoot an animal with a crossbow ? it 's ridiculous , and i 'm very sad about it			0
to see it embedded in its eye was very sad			2
' irate : mr @entity10 said he does n't want to let the attackers get away with it , and wants the police and @entity108 to get involved the injured cow , left , will lose its sight in its left eye a spokesman for @entity134 , said : ' this was a callous and unnecessary act against a defenceless animal			1
