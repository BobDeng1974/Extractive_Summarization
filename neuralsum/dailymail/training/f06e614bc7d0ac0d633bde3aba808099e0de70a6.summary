beyond : two souls is a lacklustre videogame			0
but it ’s still an entertaining , if flawed , interactive movie			0
for what it lacks in gameplay , it makes up for in ( mostly ) wonderful cinematography , action - packed ( if sometimes over-the - top ) set pieces , and a mesmerising performance from @entity10			1
written and directed by @entity11 – the man who penned the acclaimed @entity12 and @entity13 – you ‘ play ’ @entity15 ( page ) , a girl possessed by a spirit she calls @entity18 , who has a variety of powers at his disposal			1
enjoyable : there are plenty of plot holes and @entity11 's writing is heavy - handed at times , but @entity29 still entertains plot bounces back and forward in time uncomfortably			1
one minute you 're reliving key events from @entity15 ’s upbringing - and her relationship with dr @entity34 ( voiced by @entity35 )			1
the next you 're at the centre of an all - action , @entity38 - inspired chase scene			1
thankfully , for what @entity29 lacks in coherent plot , it makes up for by @entity10 ’s performance			1
at its heart , the game revolves around @entity15 ’s relationship with @entity18 – and it is the earlier , quieter sequences ( especially a party scene ) , that are both the most memorable and the most effective at driving the interplay between the two home			1
interestingly , it ’s during these moments that the lack of any real gameplay does n’t seem to matter as much			0
as in @entity12 , player interaction is reduced to button prompts and manipulating the sticks to mimic an on - screen movement			1
sadly , this system is just too passive for the game ’s more action - orientated scenes			2
quick - time events are incredibly rigid , and often have the same outcome if no buttons are pressed			2
the ability to use @entity18 is also far too scripted			1
he ’s not available all the time , and can only possess certain souls			0
indeed , it forces you down a certain path with such uncompromising force that it reaffirms suggestions that @entity11 may be a frustrated movie director at heart			0
flawed : during the @entity76 events , often doing nothing will not really affect the outcome although there are multiple endings , all of @entity15 ’s choices feel insignificant compared to the life or death decisions in @entity12			0
environments , although technically masterful , are all smoke and mirrors – offering very little depth in exploration , bar the odd object to pick up and examine			2
facial animations are wonderful , though , detailed enough to depict even the most intricate of emotions			2
go into @entity29 as an experience , not a game , and you ’ll enjoy the ride			0
but be warned … it ’s a bumpy one			0
beyond : two souls is out friday october 11			0
agree with @entity98 ? follow us on @entity100 : @ @entity101 and on @entity102 : @entity103 .			0

*stunning* overall presentation , especially in the facial animation
*brilliant* performance from @entity10 but some heavy - handed writing
you do *n't* really ' play ' it , rather *twiddle* the odd button now and then
*extremely* *linear* and @entity18 power is under - developed
