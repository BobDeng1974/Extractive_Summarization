by @entity0 published : 13:18 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 06:31 est , 31 july 2013 @entity2 has revealed that her late friend @entity3 was so ' madly in love ' with @entity5 , she considered moving to @entity6 to be with him			1
in a @entity9 article titled : ' the grandmother @entity10 knew ' , @entity2 says @entity3 , who dated the heart surgeon from 1995 - 97 , sought her advice during fundraising visits to @entity15			1
' she wanted to know how hard it had been for me to adapt to life in @entity6 , ' @entity2 told the magazine 's contributing editor @entity19			0
true love : the september 2013 @entity9 features the late princess @entity3 on its cover			2
inside , the magazine discusses her relationship with @entity6 heart surgeon @entity5 close friends : @entity3 pictured with @entity2 on 21 february 1996 in @entity15			1
it was on visits such as these that @entity3 would seek @entity2 's advice on moving to @entity6 ' both times she also went to meet [ @entity5 's ] family secretly to discuss the possibility of marriage			1
' publicity - shy : @entity5 , pictured in january 1997 , was in a relationship with @entity3 for two years indeed , @entity3 was apparently desperately keen to impress @entity5 's immediate family , especially his mother			2
but in spite of her best efforts , it would appear that this second love would see @entity3 yet again falling on the wrong side of an influential family			0
even though @entity3 had an aristocratic lineage , had married ( and divorced ) prince @entity44 , and was mother of the heir to the @entity48 throne , @entity42 was unlikely to approve of her son contemplating marriage with an @entity52 woman			0
' [ for a ] son to marry an @entity52 girl is every conservative @entity57 mother ’s worst nightmare , ' @entity2 said			0
' you send your son to be educated in @entity52 and he comes back with an @entity52 bride			0
it ’s something they dread			0
' though the couple discussed marriage and children ( friends of @entity3 told the magazine that she had wanted a daughter with @entity5 ) , the relationship fell apart around the time that she met @entity70			0
@entity3 's friend @entity71 says @entity5 was the one who initiated the break - up , but other friends argue that @entity3 ended it because the surgeon refused to marry her			1
in fact , @entity71 insists to this day that @entity3 's relationship with @entity70 was only to make @entity5 jealous			1
on the silver screen : @entity3 's relationship with @entity5 is at the centre of the upcoming film @entity3 , starring @entity82 in the title role it would seem that marriage was certainly a point that divided the couple			1
according to @entity2 , @entity5 ' hated the thought of being in the glare of publicity for the rest of his life			0
' and indeed , in his interview as part of the @entity96 inquiry into @entity3 's death , he called marriage ' a ridiculous idea ' , adding that he ' told her that the only way i could see us having a vaguely normal life together would be if we went to @entity6 , as the press do n’t bother you there			2
' insider 's theory : @entity71 pictured ( left ) with @entity3 in 1993 , believes to this day that @entity3 used @entity70 to make @entity5 jealous royal ties : @entity3 in 1995 on the @entity109 with @entity110 , @entity111 and prince @entity44 @entity3 's relationship with @entity5 is at the centre of the upcoming film @entity3 , starring @entity82 in the title role			1
despite this fact , @entity9 reveals @entity5 refused to cooperate with filmmakers , remaining very much the man @entity3 once described to a friend as ' the one person who will never sell me out			2
' the september issue of @entity9 will be available on newsstands in @entity123 and @entity124 on august 1 and nationally on the @entity125 , @entity126 , and @entity127 on august 6			2
