not just a localised colloquial term to sum up the mood of @entity3 fans watching their club pummelled and pilloried from all angles at the moment , but a fair enough way of describing exactly how @entity8 and the @entity10 board feel about each other			1
as a settlement is finalised to end a business relationship utterly lacking in mutual respect , @entity12 examines how they reached this point — and what finally caused the façade of public co-operation to crumble			2
@entity8 has left @entity3 , nine days after he offered his resignation to the club why @entity22 was fed up with @entity3 redundancies to long - serving members of staff , not deemed crucial to the football department but seen by many as part of the fabric of @entity3 , are cited as the trigger for @entity8 ’s decision to hand in his notice			1
if that was the final straw , though , it is fair to say that the spine of the dromedary was already near breaking long before the manager penned his farewell letter			2
trying to compile a list of all the nonsense @entity8 has had to deal with during his time at the helm is , quite frankly , a case of choosing what to leave out			2
so apologies if your ‘ favourite ’ scandal / farce / calamity is n’t included			0
starting with the biggest bumps in the road first , the act of the club simply sliding into administration under the guidance of @entity55 — he of the garbled gabbling and , apparently , muddled mathematics — effectively killed off @entity3 ’ chances of winning the title in @entity22 ’s first season at the helm			1
rangers beat @entity63 2 - 0 on saturday , and sit second in the @entity65 table after 17 games oh sure , he had already seen his team blow a 15 - point lead to be overtaken by @entity70 , suggesting that they might have lost the race regardless			0
but the 10 - point deduction did for any lingering chances			0
if plunging into insolvency was bad enough , the arrival of @entity76 ’s consortium as ‘ saviours ’ would not have gone down well with a man who , it is understood , hoped to see any combination of @entity82 , @entity83 and the @entity84 at the helm			0
when @entity76 then fails to get his @entity87 ( @entity88 ) accepted , forcing the club into liquidation , fans turned to @entity8 as the one man they could trust			1
the one man who famously refused to walk away			0
@entity3 fans have shown great support for @entity8 in the past , with his loyalty a key feature forced to start all over again in the bottom tier of @entity98 football , then hit with a transfer embargo that gave him 42 days to rebuild a decimated squad , @entity8 was faced with the perfect storm of managerial crises			1
any one of which would have been a good enough excuse to call it a day , just over a year into the job			0
since then , he has shrugged aside direct public criticism from the increasingly buffoon - like @entity76 , offered his vocal support to an ever - changing cast of chief executives , some of which he might actually have trusted , and agreed to cut his — admittedly excessive — salary by almost 50 per cent			0
@entity8 has gone through several changes of owners , with @entity118 now holding the power at the club finally , as those one - off bad results in the cup competitions started to cluster together in a championship season that must end with promotion , came the whispering campaign , the blame , the cuts			1
from dealing with all that had come his way with fortitude and , for the most part , good cheer , the lawyered - up @entity8 , who stuck to the ‘ no - comment ’ line when pressed on his resignation on the friday night before his team lost at @entity138 , looked like a man at the end of his tether			1
why @entity3 grew fed up with @entity22 how do you sack a manager who has won back - to - back titles by record margins ? a head coach who was already a club legend as a player — and assistant to the most popular gaffer in @entity3 ’ modern history ? well , those who make even a half - hearted attempt at balancing the books start by calculating what keeping him in place would have cost the club			1
and whether they can possibly survive without returning to @entity98 football ’s top flight at the first attempt			0
despite throwing away that huge lead over @entity70 in season 2011 - 12 , @entity8 became effectively untouchable when he took on the mantle of front man , public face and spiritual leader to @entity3 fans during the administration crisis			1
@entity3 boss @entity8 looked in high spirits during saturday 's win despite recent difficulties at @entity10 within 24 hours of the club sliding into insolvency , @entity8 gained instant legend status when , asked if he was considering his own future , he declared : ‘ at @entity3 , we do n’t do walking away			1
’ even the most ardent brand of hero worship only lasts so long , however			0
if that first season was just about winning the title , subsequent cup failures began to ebb away at confidence in the former striker who had been such an integral part of @entity186 ’s successful second coming at @entity10			1
in august 2013 , they lost 2 - 1 away to @entity188 in the first round of the @entity190			0
if that was painful , their loss to @entity193 in the @entity194 in april 2014 was seen by many as a turning point for the manager ’s popularity			0
defeat to @entity193 in the @entity194 last season was a turning point for @entity8 taken on its own , last month ’s disaster in the @entity204 at @entity205 — blowing a 2 - 0 lead to lose three late goals against part - time opposition — would have been enough reason for a lot of fans to consider his time was up			1
the fact that yet another cup howler came during an underwhelming @entity65 campaign , with home - and - away losses to leaders @entity218 and a defeat to @entity220 at @entity10 already on the cards , irrevocably tipped the balance against @entity8			2
suddenly , every aspect of his management has been open to question , from a signing policy that saw senior professionals poached from top - flight clubs , to their subsequent failure to blow away lower - league opposition			2
with the prospect of automatic promotion slipping ever further out of sight , the board ’s hand was only stayed by a lack of cash needed to pay off the manager			0
@entity8 ’s resignation brought the subject to a head			2
leaving the cash - strapped board thoroughly , well , scunnered .			0

@entity8 left @entity3 on *sunday* , after resigning last week
@entity8 stuck by the club after their liquidation and subsequent *demotions*
but club frustrated by manager 's transfer policy and cup defeats
both parties feel let down after the relationship broke down this season
