by @entity0 published : 11:54 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 12:04 est , 31 october 2012 a mother whose son was mauled by a dog today called for a change in the law after police said they could not take any action because the attack happened on private property			1
mother - of - four @entity11 , 32 , was horrified when @entity12 , nine , was savaged by the @entity14 shepherd cross at a friend ’s house			1
the dog clamped its jaws around the boy ’s face before tearing a chunk out of his top lip and slashing his cheek with its paw			1
@entity25 clamped its jaws around his face : @entity28 ( left ) bears the scars of a horrific dog attack while staying at a friend 's house and ( right ) after receiving stitches in hospital @entity11 reported the incident to @entity35 , but was told they were powerless to act because the incident occurred on private property			1
currently , police can only prosecute owners of dogs who harm people if the attack happens in public and they can only forcibly remove illegal dogs			2
but the @entity46 is now trying to change the law to allow prosecutions to take place			2
after the unprovoked attack on october 4 , @entity12 was rushed to hospital where he was put under anaesthetic for an hour and needed several stitches to his face			1
mrs @entity11 slammed @entity35 for ' not caring ' about her son and called for an immediate change to the law			0
' it could have killed him ' : @entity12 's mother @entity11 ( right ) is calling for a change in the law which at present does not make dog attacks on private property a criminal offence she said : ' the law is ridiculous			1
it basically means that if a dog attacks someone on private land nothing can be done to put the animal down			1
' at the end of the day , it should be on merit of the bite not where the attack happens			2
' if the bite had happened 8ft from where it did , the dog would have been taken and put down because it would have been on a public path			1
' mrs @entity11 claims the attack was ' completely unprovoked ' after her son went to stroke the animal			1
' unprovoked attack ' : @entity12 was rushed to hospital where he was put under anaesthetic for an hour and needed several stitches to his face she added : ' i want the owner and the police to do what ’s right by my child and stop the dog from attacking anyone else in the future			1
' the way the police treated us was disgusting			0
they would not even come out to see us to make sure he was ok			0
' they did not care about my son and just said there would never be a law change because they would get too many calls from postmen			0
' if my son had been attacked by a person the attacker would be arrested so why ca n't action be taken against an animal			2
' @entity12 was at the home of a friend in @entity116 when he was attacked by the animal			2
mrs @entity11 said she was shocked when the couple , who were her friends , refused to take any action against the dog			0
she added : ' they were great at first			0
but when i told them they needed to do something about the dog they just ignored me - it is a dangerous creature and might attack someone else			0
' it could have killed my son and it is still roaming around			0
' it is just so shocking if it was by my pet i would have it put down immediately - it is a real risk to other children			0
' a spokesman for @entity35 said : ' if a dog bites someone on private property it is a civil matter between the owner of the dog and the victim			0
' we did receive a call regarding this incident and both parties were given advice			0
' under the @entity152 , dog owners can not be prosecuted if their animal attacks someone on private property			1
however , @entity46 are considering a change to the law to give courts the the power to jail dog owners for two years or impose a £ 5,000 fine if animals cause injuries while ‘ dangerously out of control ’ in their own homes .			0

@entity28 had chunk of top lip torn off by @entity14 shepherd
he went to stroke dog at friend 's house when animal bit his face
it is only a criminal offence if dog attacks take place on public land
mother : ' if bite happened 8ft away , dog would have been put down '
