there is outrage at the highest levels of the @entity5 @entity4 community after a senior sheikh who recently met with prime minister @entity7 was unable to board his flight after being stopped for a two - and - a - half hour baggage check			1
sheikh @entity10 was leading a delegation to @entity12 for the annual @entity14 spiritual pilgrimage when he was halted by authorities at @entity16 last thursday			1
he was released without charge but was the only member of the delegation to miss his flight			2
the incident provoked an extraordinary blast from religious leader @entity23 dr @entity22 , who expressed his ' anger ' over the sheikh 's ' detention ' in a fiery statement released by the @entity28 ( @entity28 )			1
made it to @entity12 : sheikh @entity10 , pictured with his delegation after the incident			1
the @entity4 community has become concerned by a number of @entity39 incidents in recent weeks , such as the alleged vandalism of this car in @entity16 's west recently			1
' it is totally unacceptable for any @entity5 citizen , let alone a senior member of the ( @entity28 ) to be subjected to this seemingly random yet profiled manner causing severe stress and unwanted convenience , ' dr @entity22 said			1
in his role as a senior @entity28 member , @entity50 was part of a delegation who met the prime minister to discuss community concerns about the government 's proposed anti-terror laws in august			1
a spokesman for @entity60 , the @entity61 , said mr @entity10 was not randomly targeted and the government would not be providing ' running commentary ' on the issue			2
' the government will take the steps necessary at our borders to protect our national security , ' the spokesman said			2
' at times this will mean that national security takes priority over the convenience of travellers			2
' our officers do not stop travellers indiscriminately , including in this instance			1
' thursday 's incident - which occurred on the same day as the largest terror raids in the country 's history - was labelled ' a bit embarrassing for all involved ' by one @entity4 leader , @entity85 , and branded ' a deliberate balls - up ' by community spokesman @entity87			1
it comes at a time where @entity4 leaders said they are concerned by anti-islamic sentiment			2
mr @entity85 , the founder of the @entity92 , said the sheikh was a ‘ respected ’ member of the community who had provided the police with advice in the past and that @entity99 had wanted to double check his baggage			1
sheik @entity10 has condemned the islamic state terror group in recent media reports			0
he has since travelled on to @entity12 , and spoken to mr @entity85 , who said @entity99 officials had wanted to double check his baggage			1
' we do n't want to ever compromise on safety , ' mr @entity85 said			0
' any individual travelling in and out , there does need to be scrutiny			0
' it was just odd on this occasion , at this particular time , that it happened to one of the most senior @entity4 clerics in @entity5			2
' it 's a bit like having a bishop who was stopped			0
it was a bit embarrassing for all concerned			0
' prominent @entity4 community spokesman @entity87 , who said he sat across from the @entity50 at the meeting with @entity4 leaders and the prime minister last month , accused the government of deliberately attempting to ' send a message ' to the @entity4 community			1
' i 'm sure that he is one of the people who would be on the computer as a high profile person , ' mr @entity87 said			0
' it 's very , very likely that detention was intentional ... i think it 's a deliberate balls - up to send a message ( to the @entity4 community )			1
' last thursday the nation witnessed the largest counter-terrorism raids in the country 's history , in which 15 people were arrested			2
@entity139 ( pictured ) was arrested and charged by police with conspiracy to commit a terrorist act last thursday			0
the counter-terrorism raids , which involved more than 800 police , were the biggest in @entity5 's history			0
an image , supplied by @entity146 , of terror raids last week			0
two men were later charged , including @entity139 , 22			0
in court documents seen by @entity151 , police alleged @entity139 conspired with @entity5 's most senior jihadist militant , former @entity153 actor @entity152 , to conduct a public beheading on a random member of the public			0
following the raids , @entity158 police commissioner @entity157 announced the beginning of @entity161 , which will see 220 police deployed in ' high visiblity police work ' across @entity16 to maintain order and protect significant infrastructure and iconic locations			0
members of the @entity4 community have set up a @entity170 page , the @entity171 , to publicly document @entity173 incidents			1
the page had recorded a number of recent threats , including towards the @entity23 and a number of mosques			0
mr @entity85 said recent threats against @entity179 were actually helping the islamic state terror group			0
' the people who are perpetrating these attacks , who think it 's open season at the moment , are inadvertently helping @entity187 , ' mr @entity85 said , using an alternative name for the @entity189			0
' they are actually doing it because they think they 're helping the war against @entity187 by attacking local people , but what they 're doing inadvertently is driving a lot of @entity179 in @entity5 to the margins			0
' you want to be doing the exact opposite because , in fact , any war against @entity187 requires full cooperation from the @entity4 ( community ) , ' he said , adding that it is members of the @entity4 community who are denouncing extremist neighbours and tipping off @entity206 to threats			1
