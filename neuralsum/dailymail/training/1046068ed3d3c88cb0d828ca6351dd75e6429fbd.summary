@entity0 has taken a step closer to reality as rapid dna testing that could identify killers in hours has been revealed			2
the method reduces the time taken to identify suspects at a crime scene from days , preventing suspects going on the run or committing another offense before they are apprehended			0
@entity14 , in tandem with innovative fingerprint technology , is being heralded as a significant revolution in crime scene investigations			1
the @entity17 has invested £ 431,000 ( $ 732,000 ) in development of ' @entity14 ' as part of the @entity20			1
through the endeavour they are hoping to improve the accuracy and speed of identifying suspects at a crime scene , and prevent instances of false identification a technlogy being developed by @entity30 ( @entity30 ) is offering more complete identification of criminals			1
their microscopic technology is called @entity35 ( @entity35 ) and it traces drugs , hair and cleaning products in fingerprints			0
it has been developed by researchers at @entity30 ’s @entity42 ( @entity43 )			2
the technology uses @entity35 - @entity35 to produce multiple images of fingermarks			2
this can reveal tiny changes in shape , and reveal particles and other elements hidden within the ridges			0
these details can be important background information in a criminal investigation , especially if the suspect 's fingerprint is not on the police database and a positive @entity59 can not be made			1
according to @entity60 , £ 431,000 ( $ 732,000 ) has been given by the @entity17 to the @entity20 to forces in @entity62 and @entity64 - shire to introduce faster dna procedures			1
so - called rapid dna is a process through which dna profiles can be returned in two hours or less			2
it is believed to be an important breakthrough for crime scene investigations that could prevent criminals repeat - offending before they are caught			0
earlier this year the first application of @entity14 took place in @entity75 using a system known as @entity77 , which can identify suspects in under 90 minutes			1
developed by @entity80 in the @entity81 and @entity82 in the @entity83 , it can match swabs taken from a crime scene against a national dna database and produce a match quickly			1
the portable device , which looks a bit like a printer , can take dna and produce the result much quicker than modern dna systems			2
most importantly , the device does not require any specific specialist knowledge to be used			0
all it requires is that someone input a sample of dna , and it will then cross-reference the sample with the dna database			1
it takes about three minutes for a user to input the a swab into the system and begin the analysis			2
results on @entity14 matches will then be produced in less than two hours - and the device can even process seven samples simultaneously			1
earlier this year the first application of @entity14 took place in @entity75 using a portable system known as @entity77 ( shown ) , which can identify suspects in under 90 minutes , developed by @entity80 in the @entity81 and @entity82 in the @entity83 another system being introduced in the @entity83 is being developed by @entity30 and involves in - depth analysis of fingerprints			1
the technology is known as @entity35 ( @entity35 )			0
in trials with @entity118 police researchers have been taking marks from crime scenes and taking them back to the @entity30 ’s laboratories for study			0
from even just partial prints the scientists can find out the complete background of a criminal including their gender and drug use habits			0
@entity129 - @entity35 , which is a powerful technology normally used to map different molecules within tissue sections , produces multiple images of fingermarks which are made up of materials from the surface of the skin and from gland secretions			0
conventionally , fingermarks found at the scene of a crime are lifted after using a powder to enhance them , and are then compared with prints on a police database to identify a suspect			0
the research team also discovered that the cooking spice , turmeric can be used as the powder to lift fingermarks within the @entity35 - @entity35 process .			0

@entity83 @entity17 has invested £ 431,000 in development of ' @entity14 '
the system will enable the identification of suspects in under two hours
one device being introduced looks like a printer and accepts swabs
it can be used by someone with no *expertise* and matches the inputted swab against the national dna database to make a match
and at @entity30 in - depth fingerprint technology is being developed to reveal more about a criminal 's background
