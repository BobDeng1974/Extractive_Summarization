as a successful tv chef , you might expect @entity2 to urge you to eat more			1
but the presenter of @entity6 ’s @entity5 series has turned to fasting to offset his @entity8 ‘ gluttony ’ , he said yesterday			0
he has become the latest supporter of ‘ intermittent fasting ’ , heralded as the biggest diet revolution since the @entity12			1
dieters eat normally for five days a week but dramatically reduce their food intake on the other two days			1
weight loss : @entity2 has already lost 8lbs since embarking on the ' intermittent fasting ' diet slimming down : @entity18 looks vastly different from his former , more portly , self @entity2 , 48 , admitted he struggled to stick to his own @entity5 lifestyle of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables , writing : ‘ at the turn of the year , like so many , i consumed way too much meat , cheese , cream , sugar and alcohol			1
‘ and despite a garden bursting with brussel sprouts , kale and winter salads , and a weekly delivery of organic apples , oranges , clementines and bananas , i know i did n’t eat nearly enough fruit and veg to offset the gluttony			0
’ he said he had started intermittent fasting on @entity44 , meaning he has gone through six days of fasting , and had lost 8lb			1
the chef limited his food intake on fast days to a 250 - calorie breakfast and a 350 - calorie supper and drank black and herbal teas during the day to stave off hunger pangs			1
the chef said despite having a garden full of vegetables he indulged in dairy , meat and alcohol supporters claim that fasting can help dieters to lose weight , live longer and delay diseases including dementia , diabetes and some cancers			1
the regime supposedly mimics the lifestyles of our ancestors , when humans had to hunt for food and did not eat high - energy foods such as meat , fat and sugar on a daily basis			0
writing in the @entity79 , @entity2 said our modern - day favourites like burgers and chocolate brownies were ‘ delicious , but insane ’			1
he said : ‘ these compound meals , too often glued together with synthesised products our bodies do n’t even recognise as food , curdle and rot in our stomachs , giving us varying degrees of nausea , acid reflux , gaseousness and cramp , and pushing our stressed digestive systems to the absolute limit			0
‘ no wonder we ’re bloating like dead whales and dropping like flies			0
‘ of course , i realise that all my books and television shows are largely complicit with this disastrous approach to eating			0
‘ i like to think i am at the healthier , more natural end of the spectrum - in fact , my professional self - respect is predicated on that			0
‘ but i think it would be unwise not to acknowledge that even the “ @entity5 diet ” - rich as it ought to be in fresh vegetables and fruit - is open to abuse			1
and i should know : i abuse it often enough			0
’ the book @entity110 by dr @entity111 tells you to eat normally for five days a week – up to 2,000 calories a day for woman and 2,500 for men			1
on the other two , women limit their food intake to 500 calories a day and men 600			2
supporters claim the regime is easier to stick to than a traditional diet , and research has found links between fasting and the body ’s ability to repair itself			2
dr @entity111 , who presented a @entity130 programme on the subject last year , lost a stone in six weeks and cut his body fat by a quarter			2
critics question whether extreme calorie restriction is healthy and warn that fasting can be addictive			2
@entity2 said he felt ‘ lean and sharp ’ but questioned whether he would continue to fast regularly			1
he said : ‘ i ’ve lost eight pounds already , and i find the whole thing rather exhilarating			2
i feel i might just be part of a health revolution			0
‘ but is it really sustainable , for me or for significant numbers of others ? can i honestly say i ’m backing myself to be fasting regularly a year from now ? ‘ i very much want the answer to be yes			0
then i look at the rowing machine propped up in the corner of the kids ’ playroom			0
this time last year i was pounding it for 2,000 metres twice a week			2
it did n’t last past the first chocolate egg			0

the chef has already lost 8lbs since starting starting diet at @entity156
dieters on ' intermittent fast ' dramatically reduce calorie intake twice a week
@entity2 said he feels ' lean and sharp ' since starting diet
