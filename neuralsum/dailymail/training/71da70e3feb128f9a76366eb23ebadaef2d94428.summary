she was one of the first people to advocate the hot - right - now vegan lifestyle and has a best - selling cookbook , it 's @entity5 , so it makes perfect sense for @entity8 to launch a cookbook club			1
the mother - of - two , who is known for her strict diet and rigorous exercise regime , is encouraging her @entity15 followers to start their own foodie book clubs , just as she and her pals have done			2
writing on her lifestyle blog , the 40 - year - old said : ' this was not my idea			0
which is probably why it â€™s so good			0
foodie fan : @entity8 has just started a cook book club with her friends and shared some of her favourite recipes from this week 's tome on her @entity15 ' while i have always liked the idea of a book club ( sorta ) i am just not that type of gal. until one of my gorgeous girls suggested we do a different book club of sorts			1
a cookbook club ! now , as someone who gets in bed and reads cookbooks cover to cover as if they were novels , this idea was scintillating			1
' @entity8 , 41 , says when she her girlfriends set up their club and sought the perfect first cookbook , they searched for ' something challenging , beautiful , and with the possibility of becoming a classic '			1
the actress says she chose @entity54 , by @entity56 - based chef @entity55 , because it 's full of ' challenging ' and ' inventive ' recipes that she and her friends would probably never have attempted at home until pushed			1
and how right she is			0
what on earth is ' maltagliati and sungold tomato ' ? ' smoked sablefish , meyer lemon , cucumber , @entity68 muffin ' sounds equally perplexing			2
and we 're not totally sure if @entity71 's stock sea urchin either , so that 's another recipe out			0
book worm : speaking about establishing the cook book club , @entity8 , who loves cooking , said : ' as someone who gets in bed and reads cookbooks cover to cover as if they were novels , this idea was scintillating ' foodie friends : @entity8 , pictured with @entity81 and @entity82 , @entity8 famously follows a super healthy macrobiotic diet after a gruelling schedule and lapse of overindulgence two years ago left her feeling fatigued and faint however , it 's encouraging to see there are plenty of comforting carbs among the famously healthy actress 's six recipes , including ' maltagliati ' , a type of pasta from the @entity97 region of @entity98 , linguine , @entity68 muffins and pappardelle duck ragu			1
readers may be shocked to see that @entity8 , also includes a recipe for - shock , horror ! - fried chicken			1
@entity8 did recently admit that you should always allow yourself a few treats - so perhaps a homemade @entity110 is hers			2
' i often have a glass of red wine in the evening and smoke a cigarette on a saturday			0
i love those moments because they are just the right amount of naughty , ' she told @entity118			0
' that balance keeps you vibrant			0
you have to live your life , after all			0
' treat days : @entity8 admits that you should allow yourself programmed treat days - her treat of choice is a glass of red wine			2
