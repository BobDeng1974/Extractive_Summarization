by @entity1 reporter published : 19:48 est , 1 september 2013 updated : 08:24 est , 2 september 2013 growth : men are , on average , four inches taller than they were around the time of the start of the @entity6 men are four inches taller than they were 100 years ago , according to a new study			1
researchers found the average height of @entity12 men has grown by 11 centimetres in just over a century			1
and , contrary to expectations , the study also found that average height actually accelerated in the period spanning the two @entity16 and the @entity17			2
@entity18 , professor of economics at the @entity20 , examined and analysed figures for the average height - at the age of around 21 - of men from the 1870 ’s to 1980 in 15 @entity12 countries			1
the statistics were drawn from a variety of sources			2
for the most recent decades the data was mainly taken from height - by - age in surveys			2
figures for the earlier years were based on data for the heights of military conscripts and recruits			0
the figures are for men only as the historical evidence for women ’s heights is severely limited			1
professor @entity18 said : ' increases in human stature are a key indicator of improvements in the average health of populations			2
' the evidence suggests that the improving disease environment , as reflected in the fall in infant mortality , is the single most important factor driving the increase in height			0
' the link between infant mortality and height has already been demonstrated by a number of studies			0
' infant mortality rates fell from an average of 178 per 1,000 in the period from 1871 to 1875 to 120 per 1,000 in 1911 to 1915			0
they then plummeted to 41 in 1951 to 1955 and just 14 from 1976 to 1980			0
prof @entity18 said that in northern and middle @entity12 countries - including @entity65 and @entity66 , the @entity68 countries , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , and @entity72 - there was a ' distinct quickening ' in the pace of advance in the period spanning the two @entity16 and the @entity17			1
smaller family sizes , better nutrition and improved livjng conditions are behind the spike in height			0
file picture he added : ' this is striking because the period largely pre-dates the wide implementation of major breakthroughs in modern medicine and national health services			1
' one possible reason , alongside the crucial decline in infant mortality , for the rapid growth of average male height in this period was that there was a strong downward trend in fertility at the time , and smaller family sizes have already been linked with increasing height			0
' he said other factors in the increase in average male height include an increased income per capita ; more sanitary housing and living conditions ; better general education about health and nutrition which led to better care for children and young people within the home ; and better social services and health systems			1
the findings were published in the journal @entity119 .			0

@entity12 men have grown thanks to healthier diets and better housing
*interestingly* , health breakthroughs do *n't* appear to be a major *influence*
