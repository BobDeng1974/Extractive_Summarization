@entity0 tried six versions of the @entity3 pudding from different supermarkets for many of us it is — along with the @entity9 ’s television address at 3pm — the defining moment of @entity3 : the arrival of the pudding ! at a signal from the kitchen , everyone round the dining table falls silent			1
the dog whimpers and takes cover			2
@entity19 pours the heated brandy			2
shades of napalm in the @entity25 as the brandy catches fire and @entity27 asks a black - faced @entity19 : ‘ do you think you poured too much , dear ? ’ but seriously , here she comes , folks , here comes the great , black beauty of a pudding , a flaming , round mound of dark deliciousness with a sprig of ( now rather singed - looking ) holly protruding from its summit and dollops of brandy butter just waiting to melt down its flank			2
or , quite often , yuck , particularly from younger members of my family			2
they groaned when i told them we were to ‘ test - drive ’ @entity3 puds from six of the big supermarkets			1
‘ but i hate @entity3 pudding , ’ wailed @entity52 , 11			1
she soon changed her mind when i mentioned that anyone trying the puddings could have a small glass of pudding wine , a pleasing @entity59			1
she relented and joined our pudding panel			2
i always loved @entity3 pud as a child — and i still do			1
perhaps that tells you i am a natural gourmand , or perhaps it started thanks to financial greed — our @entity3 puds always had sixpences hidden in them			1
ah , the good old days before decimalisation			2
my own children , particularly the girls , have been slower to appreciate the annual ‘ treat ’ of sultanas , raisins , currants , nuts , orange peel and so forth			2
but maybe we were buying the wrong sort			2
maybe we could find a supermarket pudding that would convert them			1
actually , for the past couple of years i have made my own @entity3 puds , and i thought they were fantastic : oozing wetness with fat from the suet			1
we did the proper thing of making them on ‘ @entity92 ’ just before @entity93 and adding interesting pieces of dried fruit , sloshings of brandy , all stiffened with breadcrumbs and given some colour with liquid @entity101			2
our mission for the @entity103 , however , was to try supermarket puddings			1
we bought roughly the same size puds ( 450g or about 1lb , enough to serve four ) from @entity106 , @entity108 ’s , @entity109 , the co-op , @entity111 and @entity107			1
prices ranged from £ 2.50 ( @entity113 ) to £ 4 ( @entity111 ) , but we cheated slightly on the latter because @entity111 had an offer on its ‘ @entity117 ’ line , and we thought we would be extravagant			1
it promised to be a ‘ wonderfully rich , moist pudding ’			2
@entity111 was not the only supermarket that had employed wordsmiths			1
@entity107 described its pud as ‘ richly decadent ’ ( decadence at £ 2.99 ! ) while the co-op ’s had been ‘ matured for six months ’			1
that ’s longer than many a prison sentence these days			2
my tasting panel was : my mother @entity146 , 80 ; my wife @entity147 ; and children @entity148 , 17 , @entity150 , 16 , and the reluctant honor			0
i should declare now that i sometimes write theatre reviews for a @entity109 magazine but this was a blind tasting , conducted to standards of impartiality that would not disgrace the @entity158 itself			1
i cooked the puddings in a microwave borrowed specially for the occasion — i normally avoid such machines , but the prospect of steaming six puddings in a bain marie for one - and - a - half hours each was unappealing			2
@entity108 's pudding - which came third - was laced with cider ( left ) while @entity111 's pudding was ' dry ' ( right ) three minutes of microwaving did the trick — ping ! — though by the end of the process the kitchen did smell faintly of burnt plastic			1
not quite the desired effect , really			0
first out of the traps was @entity113 ’ ‘ rich , mixed fruit pudding with cider and rum ’ , a steal at £ 2.50			2
it plopped from its container looking dark and just a little sinister			0
was this a @entity3 pud or a lump of lava from the slopes of @entity189 ? more than one of the panel thought it was rubbery			1
‘ sticky and boring , ’ said @entity52			0
‘ dry , ’ thought @entity148 , reaching for some pudding wine			1
‘ would n’t cross the road for it , ’ said @entity147			0
next ! enter @entity108 ’s @entity3 pudding , £ 3			1
it glistened pleasingly when it emerged from its container			0
this one was laced with cider and that certainly found favour with the 17 - year - old boy			0
looking at the label i noticed it had the ‘ v ’ sign meaning ‘ suitable for veggies ’			0
palm oil had been used instead of proper suet			1
and so , as we looked at the ingredients labels , did it prove for all the puds			0
not a single one used animal suet			1
vegetarians will see this as progress , but i am not convinced the culinary gods will be so pleased			0
@entity113 's was ' sticky and boring ' with @entity0 's wife saying she ' would n't cross the road for it ' disaster struck with pudding number three , which was @entity109 ’s ‘ richly fruited ’ offering at £ 3.75			1
when i turned the container i did not quite do so quickly enough			0
the pudding , which was juicier than its rivals , slid out at an angle — whoaa ! — and disintegrated when i tried to put it upright with a metal spatula			2
it looked like a pile of rubble after a landslide			0
image is not everything , however , and this one was the first to meet with ‘ mmmns ’ and ‘ ahhhs ’ of approval from our panel as it slid down the hatch			0
it tasted expensive and quite nutty			0
@entity147 liked the ‘ toffeeish , chewy bits ’			0
@entity148 said it was ‘ more fruity ’			0
‘ different , ’ thought @entity52 , and for the first time she was not making pretend - gagging gestures at her throat			0
we had a hit of sorts on our hands at last			0
could the @entity261 at £ 3 match the @entity109 landslide ? it certainly held together better , but i think the @entity109 collapse was basically down to cook ’s incompetence			1
‘ more boozy than the first three , ’ thought @entity146			0
‘ @entity268 and alcoholic , ’ said a smiling 11 - year - old			2
‘ good all - rounder , ’ said @entity147			0
our waistlines fast expanding ( even vegetarian @entity3 pudding is not slimming , my dears ) , we turned to our fifth candidate , @entity111 ’s @entity3 pudding with @entity128 cognac , @entity279 cider , amontillado sherry , @entity282 brandy , ruby port and brandy - soaked cherries			1
hic ! this was certainly the booziest of the puds			0
perhaps @entity111 ’s chefs were trying to improve morale at their company after recent profit warnings			1
bottom of the pudding pile : @entity107 's offering was ' spectacularly disgusting ' , according to @entity0 my wife had to go and play at a @entity299 church service after our tasting session and confessed to the vicar that she was ‘ drunk in charge of an organ ’			1
she blamed the @entity111 pud , but the @entity306 may also have been responsible			1
the @entity111 offering had a springy texture ( ‘ dry ’ , grumbled @entity146 and @entity148 ) and was paler in colour than some			1
@entity52 thought it ‘ hard to get into ’ , which made it sound like the @entity314			2
both she and her sister said the amount of booze was ‘ overpowering ’			0
one for adults ’ palates , perhaps			0
finally , we approached the @entity320 , £ 2.99			0
it is always bad luck to go last , perhaps , but i thought this was easily the nastiest of the lot			0
it seemed to taste chiefly of plastic			2
what do you get a cookbook addict for @entity3 ? if they ’ve already got @entity333 , @entity334 , @entity335 and @entity336 , and they ’re short on space , @entity332 has the perfect present			1
@entity339 from @entity332 is a box of 100 cards reproducing classic covers from the publisher ’s archives			0
some of the titles are a hoot : there ’s the cookery for men only book with an image of a hapless man chopping a carrot with a pair of scissors , and the @entity355 , which shows a stereotypical 1950s housewife lying on the sofa , smoking a cigarette and drinking a cocktail while ignoring the dinner sizzling on the hob			0
elsewhere , be grateful we are past the post-war days of @entity366 ’s @entity365			0
‘ scented , ’ said @entity146			0
‘ @entity367 , ’ declared @entity52			0
so did our @entity370 terrier , @entity371			0
she had most of my spoonful			0
it had the texture of melted lorry tyre			0
really spectacularly disgusting , in my opinion			1
the only way i could get rid of the taste was to have a clementine from a big box we bought from @entity107 at the same time as we bought the pud			1
our judges ’ verdict , in ascending order ( i.e. , starting with the worst ) was : @entity107 , @entity113 , @entity111 , @entity108 ’s , co-op , @entity109			1
the last three were certainly worth their place on your @entity3 table , but i would still place my home - made puds in a higher class			1
these , you see , are properly sinful : they are made with real suet			1
and come the day itself , my daughters agree , they will try my proper pud — provided they can wash it down with some more @entity59 .			0

@entity109 won the taste test for the best supermarket @entity3 pudding
it was *closely* followed by co-op 's offering which was ' nice and alcoholic '
but @entity107 's pudding was ' spectacularly disgusting ' , while @entity111 's was ' dry '
all the puddings had been made with palm oil instead of animal suet
