under blue skies on the @entity3 coast on tuesday , @entity0 jested how he was ‘ in the dark ’ about @entity7 ’s latest book of revelations , and happy to be there			1
a few yards away , @entity7 , clad in knee - length white socks , beany hat and a prospector ’s beard , held a toddler in his arms and posed for photographs			1
all was sweetness and light as an @entity19 training session finished on a golden october morn			0
or was it ? @entity7 made the headlines this week after the release of his controversial updated autobiography @entity0 , pictured with @entity7 last year , admits he is in the dark about his assistant 's new book appearances , after all , can be deceptive			1
consider the cover of @entity7 ’s book			1
he ’s clean - cut and close - cropped ; in contrast to his current @entity30 of @entity32 image , which @entity0 referred to as ‘ bedraggled			1
’ perhaps @entity7 will shave for thursday ’s launch in the @entity35 ; perhaps he wo n’t			1
as he admits in his book , he ’s a furrow full of frets			0
‘ sometimes , i do n’t know what role i ’m supposed to be playing , ’ he writes			0
‘ i ’m a family man			0
i ’m a @entity40 man , a tv pundit			0
i was a player with a skinhead , ’ he says wryly			0
where @entity0 is concerned , @entity7 ’s ‘ role ’ is simple			1
it ’s about working with the @entity47 players , and helping them become better , nothing more , nothing less			1
it ’s a part - time gig now , since @entity7 hitched up with @entity52 ’s @entity51 at @entity53 – that ’s @entity55 , not @entity56			1
not that @entity0 seems to mind unduly			2
‘ now that he ( @entity7 ) is with us , he ’s getting ( job ) offers every day			2
there you go , ’ noted @entity0 on tuesday			1
initially wary , @entity0 gradually warmed to the give and take nature of the interrogations over the explosive content of @entity7 ’s latest manuscript			1
by the end , he was joshing about being out of the loop			0
even so , despite the forthcoming @entity70 qualifiers , @entity68 knows there is only one show in town this week : @entity74 – the sequel			2
perhaps @entity0 is slightly perturbed by the spotlight on the musings of his assistant manager , and his pointed penmanship			1
if so , he ’s keeping schtum			0
‘ people say is this a distraction ? i do n’t feel it , ’ he insisted			0
‘ if it was n’t a book it would be something else			0
it ’s the nature of it in the build - up to matches here			0
it ’s never been any different			0
so from that viewpoint , to me it ’s not a distraction			0
i have n’t read it			0
away from all the media attention @entity7 was busy putting the @entity47 players through their paces on tuesday ‘ it obviously was going to cause some sort of furore at some stage or another , the very fact he ( @entity7 ) put his name to this book would suggest that it 's exactly what would happen			1
‘ it ’s there and it does n't matter			0
the games are the most important things for us , ’ he stressed			0
aware that humour can be a useful shield , @entity0 sought to shift the emphasis			2
‘ let ’s just say we came here and there had n’t been a book , there would have been something else , seriously			0
‘ he ( @entity7 ) would have slipped down there on the field and we 'd have been talking about that , maybe broken his leg or something like that			1
‘ there would have been something , there always is , ’ he said			0
the @entity47 take on @entity128 on saturday before facing world champions @entity130 on tuesday @entity0 believes people would be talking about @entity7 with or without the release of his new book this week with a legal background , @entity0 is more interested in criminology than sporting chronicles and as of yesterday had yet to see it			1
‘ i have n’t read it ; you may well come back to me in 36 hours if i have a look at it and say “ it ’s a major distraction ” but i ’m really comfortable i have n’t read it			0
’ @entity7 was offered the chance to manage @entity146 having played for the @entity147 back in 2005 as for @entity7 , he remains in tandem with @entity0 , of whom he writes glowingly in his book , which explains , in part , why he turned down the @entity146 managerial job at the tail end of last season			1
@entity7 writes about being ‘ all for loyalty ’ and how he was n’t ‘ two minutes ’ in the job with @entity0 when @entity146 chief shareholder @entity157 came knocking			1
if the @entity146 job offer did n't ' rock my boat ' @entity7 felt a stronger tug of allegiance to the man who offered him the chance to work in @entity19 football when people were steering clear of him			1
he writes how he shares the ‘ same ideas ’ with @entity0 as to how the game should be played			2
’ as @entity7 observes , the two men share many links			2
@entity0 managed @entity146 , while @entity7 played there ; they both managed @entity171 , both played under @entity173 , they like @entity174 and even have daughters with very similar names – @entity177 ( @entity0 ) and @entity178 ( @entity7 )			1
@entity7 jokes of the coincidences : ‘ that ’s why he gave me the job			2
’ the reality is different			0
@entity0 sensed @entity7 ’s love for football when they met on the managerial beat in the @entity188 , and on the @entity191 couch , and felt the complex @entity189 could bring passion and drive to the @entity19 gig			1
for @entity7 , the chance to work as a number two – he says he never had any problem taking orders – and get back into football was too good to ignore			2
@entity0 , who has also worked with @entity7 as a pundit , sensed the former midfielder 's love for the game yet @entity7 can not be serious when he writes about being ‘ under the radar a bit ’ as @entity19 assistant manager			1
under the radar ? @entity206 , @entity7			2
it ’s over 23 years since @entity7 played for the @entity208 against @entity209 in @entity210 , the night before the seniors drew 1 - 1 at @entity212			2
he was on the radar then and has never been off it , all beards , bust - ups , books and bookings , since			0
@entity219 releases second controversial autobiography			0

@entity0 has joked he is glad to be ' in the dark ' about @entity7 's new book
@entity0 believes people would be talking about @entity7 with or without the release of his assistant 's new book
