by @entity0 published : 04:01 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 04:09 est , 24 july 2013 water - laden ' rivers ' of flowing air are likely to bring more flooding misery to the @entity4 as a result of climate change , scientists predict			1
researchers from the @entity8 believe serious flooding will become twice as likely in the @entity4 by the end of the century , thanks to a weather phenomenon that sees huge volumes of water vapour traveling though the air			1
they have blamed climate change for increasing the occurrence of ' atmospheric rivers , ' which are already responsible for causing floods of large magnitudes in @entity4 during the winter months			1
scenes like this one of a flooded high street in @entity23 , @entity24 , could become more frequent sights			0
scientists believe serious flooding will become twice as likely in the @entity4 by the end of the century , thanks to atmospheric rivers atmospheric rivers are narrow saturated air currents that cause heavy , long - lasting winter rain in mid-latitude regions of the @entity33 and can carry enormous amounts of water			1
if the scientists are correct , we could see the weather phenomenon more frequently that produces the sort of floods that devastated @entity24 in november 2009 , @entity36 reported			2
a staggering foot of rain fell within just three days and this sort of weather could become more frequent in the years ahead			0
atmospheric rivers have been blamed for some of the @entity4 's most dramatic floods in recent times that are estimated to have caused over Â£ 1 billion worth of damage in the last year alone			1
a new study in @entity53 's @entity52 , has shown that atmospheric rivers affecting the @entity4 are expected to become stronger and more frequent by the end of the century - because of global warming , the researchers claim			1
atmospheric rivers are narrow saturated air currents that cause heavy , long - lasting winter rain in mid-latitude regions of the @entity33 and can carry enormous amounts of water			1
here , a diagram shows the concentration of water in the @entity24 flood the scientists found that large parts of the projected changes in atmospheric river frequency and intensity would be down to thermodynamic changes in the atmosphere , rather than the natural variability of the climate			0
they said this suggests that it is a response to climate change			0
to reach these conclusions , the scientists used five climate models to simulate conditions between 2074 and 2099 based on forecasts of greenhouse gas emissions			0
all the models indicated a doubling of atmospheric rivers frequency compared with that seen during the period 1980 to 2005			0
an increase in the intensity of atmospheric rivers , leading to greater amounts of rain , was also predicted			2
lead author of the study , @entity92 , from the @entity8 , said : ' atmospheric rivers could become stronger in terms of their moisture transport			2
the flooded @entity95 breaks its banks and floods properties in @entity23 , @entity24 in november 2009			0
dr @entity92 said the link between atmospheric rivers and flooding is already well established , so an increase in atmospheric river frequency will probably lead to an increased number of floods ' in a warming world , atmospheric water vapour content is expected to rise due to an increase in saturation water vapour pressure with air temperature			1
' this is likely to result in increased water vapour transport			0
' the link between atmospheric rivers and flooding is already well established , so an increase in atmospheric river frequency is likely to lead to an increased number of heavy winter rainfall events and floods			2
' more intense atmospheric rivers are likely to lead to higher rainfall totals , and thus larger flood events			0

scientists believe serious flooding will become twice as likely in the @entity4 by the end of the century , due to atmospheric rivers
these are narrow saturated air currents that cause heavy , long - lasting winter rain in mid-latitude regions of the @entity33
