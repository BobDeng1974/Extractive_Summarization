by @entity0 published : 04:25 est , 11 july 2012 updated : 18:30 est , 11 july 2012 staggered : @entity1 came back from holiday to find she was wanted by police a mother came back from holiday to find she was wanted by police – over her garden decking			1
@entity1 was staggered to find a warrant had been issued for her arrest because she had failed to get planning permission for the wooden verandah			1
and while she was away council workers had demolished the ‘ unneighbourly ’ decking on the back of her £ 350,000 home , leaving her garden like a building site			1
a note put through mrs @entity1 ’s letter box warned : ‘ you are now circulated as wanted on the police national computer – failure to contact could result in your immediate arrest			1
’ mrs @entity1 , a mother of three , said : ‘ i was gobsmacked when i found out about the warrant			1
you would think , given what has happened , that i was some master criminal , not a householder who ’s made a mistake with the planning permission			0
‘ i ’ve never been in trouble in my life and i ’ve never even stepped foot in a court			0
‘ i think this is pathetic that it has got so far			0
the council have been heavy - handed jobsworths			2
all this for a bit of decking			0
’ in november , mrs @entity1 , 46 , and her husband @entity45 , 42 , decided to put up a decked viewing area on the back of their house in @entity50 , as their steeply sloping garden meant their children wanted somewhere flat to play			1
the decking , which cost £ 4,500 , also let the couple enjoy the surrounding countryside			2
but they failed to apply for planning permission and neighbours complained the decking let them look directly into their gardens and homes			0
@entity64 , prosecuting , told magistrates in @entity50 : ‘ it was a considerable and substantial decking area			1
mrs @entity1 , from @entity50 , was told a warrant had been issued for her arrest and her details were on the police national computer ' the officer was satisfied that planning permission was needed and had not been applied for and it was likely that would be unneighbourly			1
‘ it caused serious overlooking of the adjacent garden and looked into the adjacent rear bedrooms			0
’ in december , @entity50 council ordered the couple to remove the decking – which , at more that 12 inches off the ground , breached strict planning rules – by march			1
but the couple , who are in the process of getting divorced , failed to do so			0
outdoor living : @entity1 's decking under construction in her back garden			2
the council tore it down and sent her a £ 1,500 bill for its removal measure : @entity50 council said the decking was ' completely unneighbourly ' because it was raised more than 30cm above the ground they claimed to have ‘ too much on their plate ’ after burglars broke into their home and stole thousands of pounds worth of electrical goods			1
they also missed a court hearing last month , where warrants were issued for their arrest			2
yesterday the couple appeared in court and were fined almost £ 1,450 after pleading guilty to failing to comply with an enforcement notice which required they take the decking down			1
they were also told to pay £ 437 costs and face a further £ 1,500 bill from the local authority for the cost of removing the decking			1
mr @entity117 , who runs a car security business , had responded to the warrant , which was withdrawn before yesterday ’s proceedings			0
mrs @entity1 and husband @entity45 , 41 , had put up decking without planning permission he said : ‘ we had no idea when we set up the decking that it would be infringing the planning policy			2
‘ unfortunately , we had a lot on our plate which meant that we could n’t get anything done in time			0
the council just came and took it down			0
‘ i accept that it does overlook next door ’s garden , there is no dispute in that			0
‘ he saw us putting it up and then made a complaint because we did n’t put fencing up			0
‘ with the break - in and the divorce which we are going through it was just one of those things			0
’ councillor @entity146 , of @entity147 , said that officials had made several attempts to contact the @entity150 to get them to comply with the enforcement notice			1
he added : ‘ as the harm caused by the development was so severe , we had no option other than to carry out the steps required by the notice			0
’ order : mrs @entity1 was told that failure to contact the warrants office could result in her immediate arrest			2

@entity1 , 46 , was issued with arrest warrant while on holiday
while she was away , council demolished decking at her @entity50 home
magistrates fined her for failing to comply with enforcement notice
she must also pay £ 1,500 council bill for the cost of removing the decking
