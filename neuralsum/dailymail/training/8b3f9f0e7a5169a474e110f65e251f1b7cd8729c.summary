by @entity0 published : 19:30 est , 13 february 2013 updated : 04:00 est , 15 february 2013 is it a bird ? is it a plane ? no , it ’s an asteroid that will almost hit @entity6 – relatively speaking			1
just before 7.30pm today , a 150ft wide chunk of space rock will whizz past us in the closest shave since records began			2
if it hit the planet , it could wipe out a city the size of @entity16 and do as much damage as 1,000 of the atomic bombs dropped on @entity19			0
the asteroid will cut through the orbit of some satellites used for weather forecasting and for satellite phones and television			1
mobile phones wo n’t be affected as they rely on land - based masts and cables			2
asteroid 2012 @entity37 was discovered last year by a @entity39 dentist turned amateur astronomer and has been closely tracked ever since			1
hurtling through space at speeds of five miles a second , eight times as fast as a speeding bullet , it will come within 17,000 miles of @entity6 at 7.24pm tomorrow			2

this view looks down from above @entity6 's north pole and shows how the rock will hurtle past inside the ring of geo - stationary satellites approach : the trajectory of the asteroid as seen from horizontally from the @entity6 's equatorial plane			1
it will come within 17,000 miles of earth astronomy expert @entity60 , of @entity61 , said : ‘ in astronomical terms , that ’s very close			2
’ too close to home : picture shows the predicted orbit of asteroid 2012 @entity67 although the asteroid wo n’t be visible with the naked eye , it should be possible to see it with binoculars			1
dr @entity60 recommends looking towards the north - east horizon around two hours after sunset			0
he added : ‘ this will give us the ideal opportunity to learn more about asteroids			0
’ ‘ if we want to protect ourselves from possible impacts in the future , we need to understand how we can manipulate them			0
‘ that would n’t be through the @entity84 option of blowing them out of the sky but by nudging them slightly out of the way			0
‘ we can also find out what sort of resources are in there			0
there are at least two projects now talking about trying to mine asteroids for precious metals and rocket fuels			0
’ he added asteroids the size of 2012 @entity37 race past the @entity6 around once in every 40 years – but there is only an impact every 100,000 to 200,000 years			1
‘ @entity104 and civilisations have survived these over and over , ’ he said			0
celestial mining firm @entity107 ( @entity107 ) has calculated that the massive asteroid , could contain resources worth £ 125billion			0

asteroid 2012 @entity37 will *quickly* pass @entity6 at *7:24pm* today
@entity21 say ' no earth impact is possible ' but it will cut through satellites ' orbit
scientists said there is a small chance television signals could be affected
it was discovered last year by a @entity39 dentist turned amateur astronomer
