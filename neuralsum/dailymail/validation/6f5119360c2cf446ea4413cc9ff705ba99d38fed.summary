@entity1 bride : @entity2 is thought to be in the @entity4 stronghold of @entity5 to her adoring father , she was just like any other 15 - year - old			1
@entity2 loved shopping at @entity8 , listening to @entity9 and watching @entity10			1
a keen pupil , she would chatter excitedly to her father about her dreams of becoming a doctor			1
and of course , like most of her schoolmates , she was utterly obsessed with her mobile			2
like most fathers , @entity18 saw nothing sinister in her constant tapping away on her @entity22			1
he assumed she was using @entity23 and the instant messaging service @entity25 simply to chat with her friends			2
only now does he know the horrifying truth – that @entity2 was being groomed through the internet by shadowy is extremists			1
the 38 - year - old father discovered too late what was going on under his nose			2
his daughter is now living in the @entity35 stronghold of @entity5 , in @entity36 , as a jihadi bride – and has told him she will never return			1
last night mr @entity18 told of his belief that sinister is recruiters had taken advantage of @entity23 and @entity25 to corrupt his daughter			2
she had told him she was too sick to go to school the day before she fled , last december 6			2
but she met up with her best friends – @entity45 , 16 , @entity46 , 15 , and @entity47 , 15 – at the @entity49 shopping centre in @entity50 , east @entity51 , that evening			2
@entity2 bought an @entity52 and some new clothes , apparently using £ 500 she persuaded her grandmother to hand over a few weeks earlier			1
the four girls had been inseparable at @entity56 , a school rated outstanding by @entity57			2
they were so close that @entity2 invited the other three to her father ’s wedding when he married for a second time in september			1
mr @entity18 , a waiter at a central @entity51 restaurant , urged police to speak to the other teenagers after his daughter vanished , and even suggested they might have considered running away with her			2
‘ i said [ to officers ] , “ keep an eye on the three girls , maybe they ’ll give you a clue			2
” @entity46 , @entity45 , and @entity47 were her closest friends , ’ he said			2
‘ i was pretty sure when my daughter went missing that the four girls would have gone together			2
and when i realised [ they had n’t ] i was surprised			2
‘ i went to @entity56 two days later , on the monday , and i spoke to the deputy headmistress and i asked to speak to the three girls			0
he said he believes she was targeted by extremists ‘ she told me “ the police are speaking to them so you ca n’t ”			1
’ @entity2 was born to @entity82 parents in @entity83 , east @entity51 , in 1999			1
she was largely brought up by her mother @entity84 until 2007 , when her father moved to @entity86			1
mrs @entity2 was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 2013 and told she had only six months left to live			1
she kept this secret from her daughter for as long as possible			0
recalling the moment their gp broke the news to @entity2 , mr @entity18 said : ‘ it was two months before her mother died			1
‘ she was crying loads , but i told her : “ everyone is going to die			0
today it ’s your mum , tomorrow it could be me			0
we need to be patient ”			0
’ growing up in a modest two - bedroom council flat in @entity104 just a stone ’s throw from the trendy bars and coffee shops of @entity107 , @entity2 harboured ambitions to become a doctor or a teacher and achieved top grades in @entity112 , her favourite subject			1
she was an ordinary teenager who loved shopping for clothes and make - up			0
but after her mother died in january last year , aged just 33 , she changed and began taking an intense interest in @entity117 , spending most of her free time praying in her room			1
family album : @entity2 pictured as a young child mr @entity18 said : ‘ i thought this was normal because she lost the closest person to her , and she ’s an only child			1
before then she was n’t very religious			0
she would n’t go to the mosque and she would wear @entity112 dress			0
‘ but then she changed her dressing style and wore a scarf and started praying five times a day			0
‘ sometimes she would go to the @entity130 for prayers			0
’ her father was not worried about this change in her behaviour , and even took his daughter to @entity136 for the hajj pilgrimage – an @entity117 ritual devout @entity117 are expected to perform at least once			1
@entity2 set her alarm to wake herself up early to pray , and she destroyed old pictures of herself , saying women should not be photographed			1
she stopped listening to @entity143 music and spent more and more time watching the news			0
it is now apparent that she was preparing to travel to @entity36 to join @entity35 , although her contacts with jihadists are impossible to trace because she has deleted her social media accounts			1
shortly before fleeing to @entity149 , she asked her father to pay for an online order from her favourite shop , @entity8 , because she needed some new clothes for the ‘ cold weather ’			2
the package arrived two days after she had run away			0
her father thinks she was groomed to go to @entity36 by two young women , who are believed to have taken her to the airport and ensured she got on the flight to @entity149			1
mr @entity18 could not believe that his daughter had left @entity86 because she was not even allowed to travel the one mile down the road from her home to @entity160 by herself			1
he said : ‘ when the police came , i was ringing my daughter continuously , but it kept going to voicemail in a different language			0
the 15 - year - old is believed to be in the @entity166 stronghold of @entity5 with classmates @entity47 , @entity45 and @entity46 ( above ) ‘ i asked the officers what the language was – two or three hours later they told me she was in @entity149			2
‘ i did n’t know why she had gone to @entity149			0
i thought she ’s got no relatives or friends there – there was nobody in @entity149 , so how come she went there ? i asked the police “ how can she fly without any parent or guardian ? ” they told me the airline ’s rules say a 14 - year - old can fly by herself			0
’ mr @entity18 does not blame the police for his daughter running away but he believes more could have been done when she was in @entity149 and making her way to the @entity36 border			1
he said : ‘ she did n’t make it to the @entity4 the same day , she was in @entity149 for a few days			0
‘ i saw from my phone records that she was still making calls in @entity149 to a @entity149 mobile			0
so i was a bit upset because i gave police all this information			0
‘ she was calling two or three people over four or five days			0
maybe they could have found her in @entity149 but they did n’t			0
’ video footage showing the three @entity86 schoolgirls an hour before they crossed into @entity36 to join @entity4 emerged last night			1
it was filmed on a hidden camera by a double agent said to work for the @entity204 intelligence agency			0
he can be heard giving the girls fake @entity36 passports and counting their bags in the boot of a car before telling them to get in the vehicle			1
‘ @entity212 , sis , ’ he says , meaning ‘ @entity213 , sisters			0
’ then he points towards @entity36 and says with a laugh : ‘ it ’s nice			1
’ he tells them it will take only an hour to reach to reach the border			0
the girls ’ bags were put in the car by a second man			0
a woman ’s voice can be heard , too , but her face is n’t shown on the 73 - second video			0
the agent , a @entity36 , is said by @entity149 to be a ‘ local asset ’ who works for @entity204 on a freelance basis			1
he was picked up by @entity149 officials just over a week ago and is in custody			0
@entity149 ’s foreign minister @entity234 said the man was ‘ someone who worked in the intelligence services of a country in the @entity240 - coalition [ against @entity35 ]			0
‘ i told this to the @entity86 foreign secretary and he replied , “ as usual			1
” ’ but a senior @entity204 government official said the suspect was ‘ not a @entity204 citizen ’ and ‘ not employed by ’ its spy agency			0
@entity249 ’s start : the girls meet the ‘ agent ’ , who gives them documents - fake @entity36 passports orders : they hand over their bags , which are placed in a car boot after arriving from @entity149 on camera : the so - called double agent ( left ) , and the second man			1

her father , @entity268 , says she was targeted by @entity117 extremists
