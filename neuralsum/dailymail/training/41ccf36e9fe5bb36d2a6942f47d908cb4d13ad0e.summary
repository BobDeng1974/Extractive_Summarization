@entity0 picked his words carefully as he considered @entity3 ’s tenure as @entity5 ’s coach but his sentiments were clear			1
‘ i would not call it a roaring success , that would be the simplest way of putting it , ’ said the @entity7 as he assessed the first five months of the pair ’s groundbreaking arrangement			1
‘ that does n’t mean that it should n’t be given more time			0
when i played @entity15 ( @entity16 ) recently he said that for these things it needs a year or two			0
so if that ’s true you ’ve got to give her more time — if people believe that			0
’ @entity5 looks dejected as he loses in straight sets against @entity26 on thursday night @entity3 ( left ) watches on as her charge @entity5 practices before the @entity29 whoever came after @entity16 was going to find that he cast a long shadow — we might call it @entity35 syndrome — but you had to wonder whether @entity5 would have capitulated so badly against @entity26 on thursday if the gnarled old @entity37 had been in his corner			1
getting just one game off the @entity41 master was an illustration of just how much ground he has lost to the trio of players who rule the men ’s tour			0
@entity26 is not even the best any more			2
@entity49 proved that title belongs to him on friday when he thrashed @entity51 6 - 2 , 6 - 2 to guarantee the year - end world no 1 slot and his place in saturday ’s semi-finals of the @entity29			1
@entity5 will not be watching if he takes @entity0 ’s advice to rest after the rigours of qualifying for the @entity59 , which probably contributed to some flat performances			1
‘ if i was his coach i ’d have him take a break , ’ said the @entity7			0
‘ he has played too much , he is on the verge of burn - out , i ’d assume			0
@entity49 ( second left ) receives his world no 1 trophy in the presence of a number of tennis legends including @entity0 ( third right ) ‘ if he learns anything from @entity26 , it would be to forget that match			1
@entity26 is magnificent at forgetting devastating losses			2
he shrugs it off and moves on			0
’ @entity5 will try to do that with @entity3 in the off - season but if he thought scrutiny of their partnership would wear off after the initial burst of interest he would have been wrong			1
@entity82 claimed in his television commentary that @entity5 has retreated into his comfort zone of playing more passively since teaming up with his @entity86 mentor in early june			0
in the wake of thursday night ’s one - sided defeat , @entity5 responded : ‘ what do you want me to do ? the guy was half - volleying the ball inside the baseline , so you had no time to react			1
‘ the ball was coming off the middle of his racket on every shot , so i ’d have been interested to see how @entity82 would have approached it			0
’ @entity5 is indeed held to high standards , in part due to his achievements			0
finishing as world no 6 in the season after back surgery is hardly a disgrace and once again he had a consistent year in the @entity107			2
@entity5 waves to the crowd as he leaves the court on thursday night following a humiliating defeat but the reason for him ending the year 0 - 9 against @entity49 , @entity26 and @entity113 is that they have continually improved and evolved their games while he has not and therein lies @entity3 ’s challenge			1
she has to try to get him playing more aggressively rather than following his natural instinct of hanging back behind the baseline			0
perhaps the embarrassment against @entity26 could serve a purpose if it convinces him of the need for change			0
@entity5 has said that it has taken about five months for a new coach to have an impact on him , so if it is working with @entity3 we should see it inside the first half of next year			2
of more concern should be the occasions this year when he has mentally dialled out of matches , something in evidence worryingly often			0
@entity136 celebrates as he beats @entity137 in three sets at the @entity29 on friday the most recent instances have been against @entity49 , @entity140 and @entity26 , but it goes back further , such as in disappointing defeats at @entity143 ’s and @entity144			1
there have been glimpses of his pre-op @entity16 form , such as the first two sets at the @entity149 against @entity49 , but there will need to be more than flashes of that if the consensual bedside manner of @entity3 is to prove a success			2
@entity49 finishes the year as no 1 for the third consecutive time and will face @entity140 in the semi-finals			1
@entity26 will face @entity136 in the other			2
@entity136 needed to win just three games on friday night against @entity137 but made certain by winning 6 - 3 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 3			1
@entity161 chief executive @entity160 floated the idea on friday of creating a world championship for under - 21s as part of a review of the sport ’s structure that includes business leaders such as designer @entity170 .			2

@entity0 says he would not call the partnership a ' roaring success '
@entity5 was beaten 6 - 0 , 6 - 1 by @entity26 on thursday night
@entity49 secured the year - end world no 1 ranking on friday
