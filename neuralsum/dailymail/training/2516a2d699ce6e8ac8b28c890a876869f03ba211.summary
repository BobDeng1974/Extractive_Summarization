by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:55 est , 31 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:33 est , 31 december 2013 @entity4 's parliament , the @entity3 , has denied claims that two artworks in its collection had originally been stolen by @entity8 , with one of the pieces falling into the hands of the @entity13 family			1
the two works in question are an oil painting , chancellor @entity17 speaking in the @entity18 , by @entity19 dated 1905 , and a chalk lithography entitled @entity21 by @entity22			1
the discovery , by an art historian , is a new embarrassment for authorities who kept quiet for nearly two years about a huge stash of looted art which came to light last month			1
a trove of 1,406 @entity32 artworks which included works by @entity34 and @entity35 were found at the @entity37 apartment of recluse @entity13			1
@entity4 's parliament , the @entity3 , has denied claims that two artworks in its collection had originally been stolen by @entity8 , with one of the pieces stolen to order by the @entity13 family among the items in the @entity13 hoard of @entity46 loot are ( clockwise from top left ) @entity48 on a @entity49 by @entity50 ; riders on the beach by @entity53 ; seated woman / woman sitting in armchair by @entity35 ; allegory / allegorical scene by @entity58 ; and @entity59 , @entity60 , arms raised , @entity62 by @entity63 the 80 - year - old is the son of @entity65 , an art dealer of part - @entity67 descent who was ordered by @entity68 to buy up so - called ' degenerate art ' and sell it to raise funds for the @entity8			1
the historian claims the @entity22 piece was once part of the @entity13 collection			1
the @entity3 yesterday issued a statement saying an art historian was reviewing two ' suspicious cases ' but a spokesman would not confirm the find			1
the historian 's investigations into the @entity4 parliament 's art collection , which began in 2012 , were continuing , the @entity3 spokesman said			1
' it is unclear when there will be a result to the investigations , ' he said			0
the @entity37 apartment where officials discovered the hidden @entity13 paintings loot : @entity94 soldiers are pictured discovering one of @entity97 's enormous art stash during the war			1
although they suspected him of dealing in @entity46 art , they let him go during @entity101 , the @entity8 looted @entity32 for all it was worth			1
as they raided homes , @entity104 soldiers would take valuables from the walls and bring them proudly back to their leader			0
but in their hunt for priceless art , a new business began : bribing @entity67 dealers			0
many of @entity32 's finest artworks were in the hands of @entity67 brokers who had been making a living out of art consultancy for decades			1
by 1941 , a trend started where people would force these dealers , fearing for their life , to give up classics by @entity35 , @entity34 , and @entity124 for little to no money			1
the bribers were often members of the regime with connections to transport links			0
in exchange they would be offered safe passage to countries such as @entity134 - knowing senior @entity8 would pay excessive amounts for their new purchase			0
last month , @entity4 authorities revealed that the @entity13 hoard was valued at £ 1billion			1
that collection had been held for decades by @entity13 the legal status of the hoard is unclear			1
@entity13 has demanded his art back and lawyers working on reclaiming property for heirs to @entity67 collectors say he may get to keep at least some			1
the @entity8 plundered hundreds of thousands of artworks from museums and individuals across @entity32			1
an unknown number of works is still missing and museums around the world have conducted investigations into the origins of their exhibits			1
the @entity3 's art collection comprises around 4,000 works and @entity159 said investigations had found some 108 pieces so far of unknown provenance			1
about four years ago , it returned a portrait of former @entity4 chancellor @entity164 in a hat by @entity166 to its original owners after it was found to have been stolen by the @entity8			2
the @entity168 called for a list of the @entity3 's art works to be published			1
' if the @entity3 is keeping lists of its collection secret , hindering the press in its investigations , protecting the perpetrators of @entity178 and not informing the heirs , i would wish those responsible to show more sensibility and tact , ' council president @entity171 told @entity159			1
@entity58 , @entity182 , @entity34 : the @entity13 hoard by @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 some were believed to have been lost forever in the chaos and carnage of the @entity101			1
others were not even known about before			0
they are among the 1,400 paintings found in the flat of recluse @entity13			1
remarkable : a painting from @entity35 called @entity195 ( @entity196 ) - one of the previously unknown works found at @entity13 's flat - is projected on a screen during a news conference in @entity200			1
it is worth an estimated £ 50 - £ 60million treasure trove : an allegorical scene painting by @entity58 worth an estimated £ 15million had never been seen by the art world before emerging from @entity13 's collection the extraordinary cache , which includes unknown works by @entity58 , @entity182 , @entity53 and @entity35 , was found when tax officials raided 80 - year - old @entity13 ’s @entity37 apartment			1
but the authorities kept secret their discovery for 20 months , and are refusing to publish details of the works			1
@entity214 , of the pressure group @entity215 , accused the authorities of ‘ what amounts morally to the concealing of stolen goods ’			0
collector : @entity97 amassed more than 1,500 masterpieces and ordered them to be destroyed in 1945 for some families missing art is the last personal effects of relatives murdered in the @entity226			0
@entity227 , of the @entity228 in @entity32 , said the response of the @entity4 authorities was ‘ troubling ’			2
she said : ‘ a list of these paintings must be published			0
there are hundreds of families around the world urgently wanting to know if any of the works belong to them			0
’ @entity238 , head of the prosecutors ’ office in @entity200 , said the works , which also included pieces by @entity243 , @entity244 , @entity34 and @entity245 , had been seized in march last year			1
most were in good condition			0
asked why the discovery had been kept secret for so long , he said : ‘ it is for us counterproductive to go public with such a case			0
the investigations are costly , complex and lengthy			0
’ the collection also contained works by @entity34 , @entity124 , @entity245 , @entity257 , @entity53 , @entity258 and @entity259 , he added			1
@entity13 vanished after the paintings were confiscated , with police suspecting that he has access to almost unlimited funds			2
as well as selling @entity264 , he sold off many of the paintings - works that would n't attract headlines - before the intervention of @entity4 customs officials			2
@entity13 was a man of mystery in many aspects of his life			2
the son of art dealer @entity65 , he did not have an official bank account , pension or insurance - he simply lived off the extensive collection , selling them when his money dipped			2
he never held down a job and was not registered with the authorities - mandatory in @entity4 - and was not known to the tax authorities or social services			2
the paintings thought to have been destroyed in the war were found hidden behind tins of rotting food in a shabby flat			0
they had been taken from their owners , many of them @entity67 , by the @entity8 , who regarded the @entity294 , @entity295 and @entity296 pieces as ‘ degenerate ’			0
the story of their recovery begins one evening in september 2010 aboard a @entity4 @entity301 train from @entity302 in @entity303 to @entity37			2
customs officials were carrying out a routine check on passengers – many wealthy @entity4 deposit money illegally in @entity303 to evade high tax rates at home – and asked for the papers of a white - haired man			0
he proffered an @entity314 passport in the name of @entity316 , born december 28 , 1933 , in @entity317 - currently residing in @entity318			0
‘ he appeared nervous , ’ said customs officials			0
he said he had travelled to @entity303 for ‘ business ’ at the @entity320 in @entity321			0
he then he pulled out an envelope with 9,000 euros in 500 euro notes inside – 1,000 euros under the legal limit which must declared to officials when crossing borders in @entity32			2
@entity13 was allowed to go on his way , but the officials remained suspicious			2
extensive checks soon disclosed that he did not live in @entity318 but in @entity330 , and he was not registered with the authorities			0
‘ he was a man who did n’t exist , ’ one official told @entity4 ’s @entity334 magazine , which broke the story			0
control : @entity68 only liked classical art and held exhibitions of modern ' dissident ' pieces to show @entity4 people what not to like			2
many of those paintings that appeared in those shows have been found in @entity13 's collection investigators applied for a warrant to search behind the barred windows of his £ 600 - a - month rented flat , eventually entering it in spring 2011			1
there they discovered a mountain of tinned and bottled food , long past its sell - by date			0
behind the decomposing food were the missing artworks			0
@entity97 was an art dealer who in the run - up to the @entity101 had been in charge of gathering up the so - called degenerate art for the @entity8			2
@entity97 had bought for a pittance many of the paintings he seized , and they had passed to his son on his death			0
@entity13 then quietly sold a few , one at a time , to give him money to live on			2
investigators are working to reunite them with the families of their rightful owners			0
one owner is already known			0
a portrait of a woman by the @entity374 master @entity35 belonged to the @entity67 connoisseur @entity375			2
@entity375 had to abandon his collection as he fled @entity377 when @entity374 fell to the @entity8 in 1940			0
his granddaughter @entity378 , wife of disgraced former @entity380 bank chief @entity379 , has been fighting for decades for the return of her grandfather ’s pictures , but is said to have not known of the existence of this painting .			0

one of the two pieces under *scrutiny* is oil painting , chancellor @entity390 , by @entity19 dated 1905
@entity393 is chalk lithography entitled @entity21 by @entity22 - claimed by a historian to be part of @entity13 collection
1,406 @entity32 artworks - including works by @entity34 and @entity35 - were found at the @entity37 apartment of recluse @entity13 last year
@entity3 's art collection comprises around 4,000 works and @entity159 said investigations had found some 108 pieces so far of unknown provenance
