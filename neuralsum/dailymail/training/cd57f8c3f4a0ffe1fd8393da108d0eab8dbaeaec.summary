by @entity0 frustrating : @entity1 will have to wait for her pet @entity3 to die before she can get her earring back an unlucky woman whose pet cockerel swallowed her diamond earring will have to wait until it dies to retrieve her precious jewellery			1
@entity1 from @entity10 lost her earring when cockerel @entity3 pecked it off while perched on her shoulder			1
she will have to wait eight years to get her hands on the £ 300 present that her partner @entity14 , 38 , gave her again			1
vets say it is trapped inside the stomach of six - month - old @entity3 and will not come out			2
@entity1 , also 38 , said ' the vet said he could operate to recover the earring , but that might kill @entity3 , which would devastate our six - year - old daughter @entity21 '			1
' so we ’ll have to wait till @entity3 gets old and dies , but they live to a ripe old age - we are probably looking at another eight years before i get my earring back			2
' @entity3 , who is in fact a cockerel despite having a hen 's name , is a family pet who loves sitting on @entity1 ’s shoulder at home near @entity35			1
@entity1 explained : ' i felt this sudden sharp pain in my ear lobe and realised @entity3 had gobbled down the earring '			1
she and @entity14 , an it specialist , put the chicken in a cage and spent the next few days searching the floor in case the earring had passed through the chicken			0
' but there was sign of it and @entity21 ’s friend ’s father , who ’s a vet , said it might have got stuck in the gizzard			2
' @entity52 : a vet 's x-ray shows the diamond earring inside @entity3 , which would be too dangerous to cut out ' we spoke to another vet , @entity57 , who said he would do an x ray			1
' the x ray showed it was stuck firmly in the gizzard so @entity57 gave @entity3 some laxatives , hoping it would pass			2
' but it did n’t work , it ’s still stuck fast and we have accepted it is trapped inside and wo n’t come out			0
missing : @entity1 's surviving earring , worth £ 300 ' the vet said he could operate and go in through @entity3 ’s stomach but it could prove fatal			1
' we could n’t face that - @entity21 adores @entity3 and would be heart - broken			0
“ the vet said over the weeks and months , the platinum white gold would disintegrate and be ground down by the grit and stuff that hens eat to aid their digestion			0
' but the diamond is so hard it will not be damaged and will just stay there in the until @entity3 dies and then of course we can get it back			2
' @entity1 explained why @entity3 is in fact a cockerel			1
she said : ' he ’s called @entity3 because when we got him as a chick , we thought he was a she			0
' when he got older and we realised it was a cockerel , we decided to stick with the name			0
' we ’re keeping as close eye on him to make sure he does n’t get caught , carried off and eaten by a fox or the diamond will be gone forever			0
' it ’s a shame i have lost the earring because it was one of a matching pair that @entity14 bought for me so they ’re really sentimental and mean a lot			0
' but we ca n’t risk anything that might mean we lose @entity3			0
' at least we know where the earring is - and one day i will get it back , even if it means waiting for a few years ! '			0
