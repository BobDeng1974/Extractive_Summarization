by @entity0 published : 11:50 est , 29 july 2013 updated : 01:34 est , 30 july 2013 the @entity2 trilogy became such a publishing phenomenon that women were n't ashamed to be seen reading the books while commuting or have them proudly on display on their shelves at home			2
but the erotic fiction by @entity11 may never have become so acceptably mainstream if it was n't for sales first taking off via ebooks			1
launching on this platform gave the novels a massive sales boost with readers who wanted to indulge in the saucy content - but did n't want anyone else to know what they were reading			1
@entity23 : with an ebook reader , people can download porn and erotic fiction without fear of anyone else knowing surge in popularity : the ' @entity2 effect ' has made erotic fiction more acceptable to read and now the same effect has led to a boost in popularity in other sexually explicit novels on @entity36 - where it seems anything goes from incest to ' monster sex '			1
no sneers or leers : ebooks allow readers to buy porn without being embarrassed and it 's not just downloading of the books that has increased , more are being written and shared - many by women using a pseudonym - via @entity36 's self - publishing service			1
one such writer is ' @entity52 ' whose titles include ' from assassin to @entity55 ' and ' @entity56 '			0
she told the @entity57 that she had to stop buying pornographic books from shops in the @entity60 because of the sneers - and leers - of shop assistants			0
but now she , and other women like her , can read what they please without anyone being any the wiser			0
she said : ' the beautiful thing about buying porn on @entity68 is that nobody sneers at you			0
it 's just you , @entity36 , and your personal mobile device			2
' you can read it on the train or subway , at home , wherever , and no one has any idea what you 're ogling			0
which removes most of the outside negative social pressure that prevents a lot of women who are interested in porn from buying it in the mainstream places			0
' while books like @entity52 's are becoming more popular thanks to the discretion of ebooks , she , and other writers like her , believe their sales would be even higher if @entity36 would promote them more			1
however , in line with them being seen as a family - friendly , accessible - to - all retailer , the brand are not keen to promote novels of a pornographic nature			2
as a result , titles like those written by @entity52 can not be found on their homepage or in their ' items to consider ' suggestions			0
they also filter their search function so these books will never appear unless purposefully sought out			0
in fact , their rules on self - publishing state that the do not accept any pornographic content at all			1
they state on the website : ' ( we ) do not accept pornography or offensive depictions of graphic sexual acts ... what we deem offensive is probably about what you would expect			0
' this has left writers such as @entity52 and another under the pseudonym ' @entity129 ' frustrated that their sales could be even higher if promoted more on @entity36			1
self - published porn : @entity36 state they do not accept pornography but these are some of the explicit books currently on sale via their website @entity129 told @entity138 : ' erotica , as a genre , has been @entity36 's dirty little secret from the beginning , driving sales of the @entity68 to astronomical numbers			1
does @entity36 really believe that it was all the free copies of ' @entity147 ' and ' @entity148 ' ... that drove readers to buy @entity68 devices ? nope , sorry			2
it was ' porn '			0
' however , while the writers may not be happy , the @entity57 argue that it is @entity36 's reluctance to embrace and promote the genre that is appealling to porn consumers			1
they write : ' women ( and men , too ) who want to read porn on the @entity68 do n't want to be buying their porn from some place that screams porn ! @entity36 's advantage as a seller of porn is precisely that it sells lots of things that are n't porn , and that it is known primarily for selling things that are n't porn			2
