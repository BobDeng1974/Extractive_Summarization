by @entity0 a foul - mouthed parrot has been kicked out of a garden centre after customers complained she was turning the air blue with a string of rude words			1
@entity8 was put on display at the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 - but came under fire for her non-stop swearing , which staff say is getting much worse			1
they have had to remove @entity18 from the shop floor for fears her profane language could offend more customers or be picked up by children			1
who 's a pretty * * * * ing boy then ? an @entity26 has been thrown out of the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity12 , for a string of foul - mouthed rants			1
staff are hoping to re-educate her ( file photo ) notice : this sign was put on @entity18 's cage after she offended customers with what staff called ' naughty words ' all is not lost , however - as they are hoping to re-educate @entity18 with a more polite vocabulary and return her to public display so she can find a loving home			1
a spokesman for @entity43 said : ' we decided to remove her from the centre after receiving a number of complaints about her repeating rude words , and her content was getting much worse			2
' we 've no idea where she 's learned it from , but we felt it would be best to take her off the shop floor			1
' it 's a very funny incident , but hopefully @entity18 can soon return			2
' the first customers knew of @entity18 's punishment was when a sign appeared on her cage announcing what had happened			2
re-education : the parrot will be retrained with a more polite vocabulary and return to the shop floor it said : ' @entity68 has picked up some naughty words and has decided to say them repeatedly			1
' we can only offer our apologies if this causes offence			0
' it added : ' please do not put fingers or objects through the bars of @entity18 's cage as she may bite			2
' the message was picked up by the local mp for @entity82 and @entity83 , @entity85 's @entity84 , who spotted it on a family day out on sunday and posted it on @entity88			0
' we 'd been out for a @entity91 meal and decided to take the kids over to the garden centre to look at the animals , ' he said			0
' @entity18 was still there at this point but thankfully she was on her best behaviour and we did n't hear a single swear word from her			0
' a spokesman for @entity43 , which runs the centre , said : ' we 've no idea where she 's learned it from ' african greys have been dubbed the @entity104 of the parrot world for their intelligence			1
a 2012 study found the birds were capable of thinking at the same intellectual level as a young human child			0
scientists at the @entity112 in @entity113 put the parrots in front of two opaque boxes , one of which contained a piece of walnut which rattled when shaken			0
more times than could simply be put down to chance , the parrots chose the rattling box - correctly deducing that there must be food inside			0
over time , when presented with the two boxes , they could even guess that the food was in the second box straight away when the first made no noise .			0

several customers complained about parrot in @entity11 , @entity12
@entity18 ' picked up some naughty words and decided to say them repeatedly '
she has now been moved from the shop floor for her *continual* swearing
centre owners @entity43 : ' we 've no idea where she 's learned it from '
