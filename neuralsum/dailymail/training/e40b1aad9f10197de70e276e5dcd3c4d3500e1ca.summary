by @entity0 published : 09:23 est , 8 june 2012 updated : 04:38 est , 9 june 2012 when @entity2 gave birth to a beautiful baby girl , it should have been the happiest time of her life			1
but the devastated new mother feared she would never see her child grow up , because she had a rare form of cancer that could kill her within 18 months			2
ms @entity2 , from @entity10 , had an emergency caesarean when she was 37 weeks pregnant with baby @entity12 after suffering an infection			1
terrible revelation : @entity2 , pictured with @entity12 and partner @entity15 , found out she had cancer after doctors found a tumour on her cervix during an emergency caesarean surgeons found and removed what they thought was a non-cancerous tumour on her cervix during the operation last october			1
it was sent off for a biopsy , and just two weeks after the birth , they told the crushed 23 - year - old that she had large cell neuroendocrine , an aggressive form of cervical cancer			1
ms @entity2 , who lives with partner @entity15 , 28 , said : ' if i was n’t pregnant with @entity12 i might never have known that i had cervical cancer			1
' we gave her the middle name @entity36 because she saved my life			0
' it was horrible being told that i had cervical cancer , but it was easier because i had @entity12			1
over the moon : ms @entity2 feared she would never see her daughter grow up , but is now in remission and making the most of every day ' she still needed her nappy changing and she still needed caring for so there was no option			1
' i was told the survival rate was just 20 per cent			1
' i looked it up on the internet when they told me what i had and it was the worst thing i could have done			0
' it said that i would be dead in 18 months			0
that was a tough week			0
' for two months ms @entity2 underwent a series of gruelling chemotherapy treatments before doctors put her on a five - week course of radiotherapy			1
large - cell neuroendocrine cancer is rare , but very aggressive , when found in the cervix			1
in its early stages , neuroendocrine carcinoma does not have any symptoms so it is not always spotted straight away			2
later on , symptoms include irregular bleeding , increased discharge , pelvic pain , painful urination , pain during sex , tiredness , leg swelling and backache			0
when left untreated , metastasis or even death may occur			0
at the beginning of march her treatment ended and she was told that she was technically in remission - although there is an 80 per cent chance of the cancer returning			2
the delighted mother believes @entity12 saved her life , because doctors would never have found the tumour if she had n’t been pregnant			1
'' they say you have to seize the day and that ’s exactly what we have been doing			0
' we ’re just enjoying life			0
' ' my mum has found it hard , but she has just not let it show			2
' my partner , whenever i contemplate the fact i might not make it , he has never let me continue to think like that			0
' doctors have told me i ca n’t have more kids , but @entity12 is like a shining light			1
' ms @entity2 is now raising money the @entity108 ’s @entity107 , where she has been receiving treatment for the past six months			1
she said : ' when i was first diagnosed they were n’t sure whether to put me in a children ’s or an adult ’s unit , but this @entity107 unit is incredible			0
' you ’ve got more things in common with the people			0
' there was one night when the football was on and we just sat and watched the football together			0
' without the @entity107 i would not have been able to have my baby girl with me throughout my treatment			2
' offering me a private room with space for my baby , partner and my mum meant i was never alone			2
' for that , i am eternally grateful and will work my hardest to ensure i pay it forward			0
' every young person deserves the love , care and respect i have been shown			0

doctors would not have found tumour if @entity2 had not been pregnant
she was given room so @entity12 could be with her during treatment
survival rate for large cell neuroendocrine cancer just 20 *%*
