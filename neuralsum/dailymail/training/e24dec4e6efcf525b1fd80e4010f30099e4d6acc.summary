by @entity0 published : 06:17 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 21:00 est , 12 march 2014 tv presenter @entity2 suffered a mini stroke during an 11 - hour flight , it was revealed yesterday			1
the 67 - year - old @entity8 host needed emergency treatment to remove a potentially fatal blood clot			1
he was initially thought to have suffered a bad asthma attack on the flight from @entity13			1
but on landing at @entity14 he was taken to hospital where doctors discovered a clot in his leg			1
it is thought part of the clot broke away and lodged in a blood vessel in his head , causing a temporary loss of blood to the brain			2
' remarkable recovery ' : @entity2 's agent said that the star is making good progress after suffering a mini-stroke on the way back from @entity33 experts say sitting on a plane for so long may have helped @entity2 ’s clot to form			1
the symptoms of a mini stroke , or transient ischaemic attack , are similar to those of a stroke – numbness in the face and limbs , and slurred speech – but they last for less than 24 hours			1
in most cases they ease within minutes but a mini stroke is often a warning that a person is at risk of suffering a potentially fatal stroke			2
@entity2 at first believed he was having an asthma attack brought on by the poor air quality in @entity55 , where he had been filming the second series of his @entity58 documentaries before flying home from @entity33			1
yesterday , @entity2 ’s manager @entity60 confirmed the presenter has been receiving treatment at @entity64 ’s @entity63 since march 1			1
the father of four is expected to leave hospital today or tomorrow			2
‘ he has had the best possible care , ’ mr @entity60 said			2
‘ it was quite a shock , but now he just wants to get back home			1
‘ he ’s in good spirits			2
he is hugely grateful for the care he has received and all the kind wishes he has been receiving on a daily basis			2
’ mr @entity60 added : ‘ he 's speaking very well , he 's moving , he 's walking and wanting to go out and about			2
he does n’t like lying in hospital			0
it ’s all very positive			0
the doctors have been wanting to make certain everything was all right			1
’ globetrotter : @entity2 was in the middle of filming a @entity81 travel show when he was taken ill ( pictured is the star on location for @entity84 ) the tv presenter was taken from the tarmac at @entity14 to @entity63 in west @entity64 , where he was seen by emergency doctors the hospital and consultant treating @entity2 is the same that looked after tv presenter @entity90 when he suffered a stroke last year			1
@entity90 has described how he was struck by ' a blinding headache and flashes of light '			0
he woke up the next morning lying on his bedroom floor , unable to move			0
he was paralysed down his left side but the area of the brain that controls speech and memory was unaffected			0
stroke is a ' brain attack ' , according to the @entity103			1
its website says : ' for your brain to function , it needs a constant blood supply , which provides vital nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells			0
a stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off and brain cells are damaged or die			0
' about a third of people who have a stroke make a significant recovery within a month			0
but most stroke survivors will have long - term problems			0
it may take a year or longer for them to make the best possible recovery			0
sadly , in the most severe cases , strokes can be fatal or cause long - term disability			0
' it says that members of the public can recognise a stroke using the @entity133 test : 1 ) facial weakness - can the person smile ? has their mouth or eye drooped ? 2 ) arm weakness - can the person raise both arms ? 3 ) speech problems - can the person speak clearly and understand what you say ? 4 ) time to call 999			0
the @entity103 says that failing any of these tests means it 's a medical emergency and it 's time to call 999 .			0
