white people who kill black people in ' @entity3 ' states are 354 per cent more likely to be found justified in their killing than a white person who kills another white person , according to research			1
on saturday @entity9 , 29 , was acquitted of second - degree murder and manslaughter in the shooting death of 17 - year old - @entity14			2
but he was not arrested for 44 days after the february 26 , 2012 , shooting as police in @entity16 insisted that @entity18 's @entity3 on self - defence prohibited them from bringing charges - @entity18 gives people wide latitude to use deadly force if they fear death or bodily harm			1
he examined racial disparity using data on 43,500 homicides from 2005 to 2009 - the most recent years for which data was available , reported @entity41			1
he narrowed the sample to about 5,000 homicides by only analysing killings in which there was a single shooter and a single victim , both of whom were strangers to each other			0
breakdown of the killings : the figures represent the percentage likelihood that the deaths will be found justifiable compared to white - on - white killings @entity33 looked specifically at ' justified ' homicides - defined as the killing of a felon during the commission of a felony , committed by private citizens			0
he discovered that killings of black people by whites were more likely to be considered justified than the killings of white people by blacks			0
frontline then asked him to analyse the data and look for findings between states which had @entity3 versus those without the laws			1
under the @entity3 , which was approved in 2005 and applies in over 30 states , people fearing for their lives can use deadly force without having to retreat from a confrontation , even when it is possible			1
the self - defence law applies in @entity18 where @entity9 shot @entity81 dead			1
the court was told that he had followed the unarmed youngster through a park because he looked like he was ' up to no good			0
' but @entity9 , a volunteer neighbourhood watchman , claimed he shot @entity14 in self - defence , and that the teen punched him repeatedly before deciding to use lethal force			1
the statute is central to @entity9 's defense in a case that captivated the @entity92 throughout much of 2012 because police initially declined to arrest @entity9 based on his self - defense argument and right to use deadly force under @entity18 law			1
@entity33 analysed the pool of 43,500 homicides by race in states with @entity3 laws and those without them			2
he found that whites who kill blacks in @entity105 states are 250 percent more likely to be found justified in killing a black person than a white person who kills another white person			0
but in @entity3 states , that number jumps to 354 percent			2
footage : @entity115 footage shows @entity14 buying skittles and a soda at a 7/11 evidence : a shirt worn by @entity9 on the night of the shooting was used as evidence in the trial injuries : photos of cuts to the back of @entity9 's head and his face were included in the evidence fatal mark : a bullet hole can be seen in the front of the hooded top @entity14 was wearing on the night he died crime scene : @entity14 was shot outside with @entity18 complex but the findings are not yet conclusive - the data does nâ€™t show the circumstances behind the killings , for example whether the people who were shot were involved in home invasions or in a confrontation on the street			1
plus there are less white - on - black shootings in the @entity32 data - only 25 total in both the @entity3 and non-stand your ground states			1
additionally @entity3 laws can be applied at multiple points during an investigation			0
@entity9 was not arrested for over a month following the shooting as police in @entity16 insisted that @entity18 's @entity3 on self - defence prohibited them from bringing charges			1
a special prosecutor later brought the murder charge			0
the prosecutor accused @entity9 of profiling @entity14 and chasing him vigilante - style rather than waiting for police to arrive			2
@entity9 left the courthouse as a free man , although the @entity166 has called for the @entity167 to open a civil rights case against @entity9			0
though the department has a history of using federal civil rights law in an effort to convict defendants who 've previously been acquitted in state cases , it 's not always easy			0
@entity176 : thousands of protestors gathered in @entity178 on sunday night to demonstrate against the acquittal of @entity9 in @entity18 late saturday			2
the march continued up @entity181 toward @entity182 when arrests began massive : the crowd of @entity187 protestors swelled in @entity178 , where they marched from @entity189 on sunday before continuing uptown blocked : with emotions high and traffic stopped , tensions rose as protestors blocked the @entity194 freeway the department said in a statement sunday afternoon that it 's looking into the case to determine whether federal civil rights charges should be filed			0
supporters have suggested that @entity14 's parents file a wrongful - death civil lawsuit against @entity9			0
@entity9 's lawyers have said he 'll seek immunity			0
@entity18 's stand your ground law may offer him that immunity if a judge concludes he acted in self - defense , said @entity209 , a former federal prosecutor in @entity210 .			2

drawn from a study using @entity32 data on homicides between 2005 to 2009
*31* states across the @entity92 have the ' @entity3 ' law
@entity18 where @entity9 shot @entity81 has the self - defence law
