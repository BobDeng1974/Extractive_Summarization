the battle over web freedom and controls is set to take place over the next 11 days , with 193 countries gathering to discuss the future of internet regulation			1
when the @entity9 delegates last met to discuss the laws of the virtual land , it was 1988 , and the @entity12 was pretty much unheard of within the general public			2
at that time , @entity15 was still a twinkle in the eyes of two 15 - year - olds , auctions could only be won if you attended in person , and @entity21 was a river in @entity23			1
now that the @entity12 is an everyday commodity for much of the world , the talks , starting today in @entity25 , will see a variety of viewpoints raised			0
some nations , including @entity31			1
having previously pressed for internet controls and censorship , while others , including a @entity36 delegation , pressing for web freedom			1
time to conference call : participants listen to the speech of @entity41 , secretary general of the @entity42 , at the @entity25 conference some delegates at the @entity25 conference - including a 123 - member @entity36 delegation with envoys from tech giants such as @entity15 and @entity48 - worry that any new @entity9 ruling could be used by nations such as @entity51 and @entity31 to justify further tightening of web blocks and monitoring			1
even @entity15 got political as the conference started , placing a message on its homepage today which reads : ' love the free and open @entity12 ? tell the world 's governments to keep it that way '			0
the 11 - day conference highlights the fundamental shift from tightly - managed telecommunications networks to the borderless sweep of the @entity12			2
the @entity25 gathering will confront questions that include how much sway the @entity9 can exert over efforts such as battling cyber-crimes and expanding the internet into developing nations			2
the secretary - general of the @entity73 , @entity72 , said that accusations how the meeting could limit web freedoms is ' completely untrue ' and predicted only ' light - touch ' regulations			2
@entity15 gets political : the search engine posted a link as it campaigned to keep the internet regulation - free ' many countries will come to reaffirm their desire to see freedom of expression embedded in this conference , ' he told reporters on the meeting 's opening day			1
however , the outcome of the @entity25 gathering is far from certain			0
the 193 nations at the meeting have put forward more than 900 proposed regulatory changes covering the @entity12 , mobile roaming fees and satellite and fixed - line communications			2
@entity99 consensus is needed for any item to be adopted for any changes - the first major review of the @entity9 's telecommunications agenda since 1988 , well before the internet age			1
the gathering is also powerless to force nations to change their internet policies , such as @entity51 's notorious ' @entity108 ' and widespread blackouts of political opposition sites in places including @entity112 and the @entity113			1
last week , @entity115 's @entity12 and telephone services disappeared for two days during some of the worst fighting in months to hit the capital , @entity119			0
switch on : any attempts for increased web regulations are likely to face stiff opposition from groups led by a major @entity36 delegation the head of the @entity36 delegation in @entity25 , ambassador @entity128 , told reporters last week in @entity130 that all efforts should be made to avoid a ' @entity132 ' of the internet in which each country would impose its own rules and standards that could disrupt the flow of commerce and information			1
' that opens the door ... to content censorship , ' he said			0
the @entity143 , representing labor groups in more than 150 countries , claimed a bloc that includes @entity51 , @entity31 and several @entity148 nations seeks to ' pave the way for future restrictions on both internet content or its users			1
' ' it is clear that some governments have an interest in changing the rules and regulations of the @entity12 , ' the confederation said in statement monday			0
another likely battle that will take place in @entity25 is over @entity163 - backed suggestions to change the pay structure of the @entity165 to force content providers - such as @entity15 , @entity167 and others - to kick in an extra fee to reach users across borders			0
advocates of the changes say the money raised could pay to expand broadband infrastructures in developing countries			0
@entity41 said he hoped for a ' landmark ' accord on trying to bring broadband internet to developing countries			2
' the internet remains out of reach for 2/3 of world 's people , ' said @entity41 , who is from @entity184			0
the @entity9 telecommunications agency dates back to 1865 , when the telegraph revolutionized the speed of information			0
over the decades , it has expanded to include telephone , satellite and other advances in communications .			0

some nations , including @entity31 , call for laws to allow state censorship
other countries , including @entity23 , call for internet freedom
nearly 200 countries will give their position on the state of the internet
