mocking hecklers is part of the job for stand - up comedians			2
but this comic was somewhat lost for words when an @entity7 officer shouted ' shut the f * * * up ' from the back of the room			1
the cop was one of four who interrupted @entity14 's set with flashlights to arrest a homeless man allegedly masturbating in the audience			1
and it seemed they could n't resist joining in on the show			0
but the next joke was cut off when four police officers barged into the room with flashlights			2
true to form , the stand - up tried to make the event part of his show			0
' well this is the first time this has happened , ' he joked , as the audience fell about laughing			0
he continues : ' guys , this is part of the act , i do this every show			0
' playing around : the comic laughs and jokes while posing for a picture with the squad behind him jokes on him : but when a police officer heckles ' shut the f * * * up ' he has no idea what to retort but he was lost for words when an officer retorts : ' what is happening ? ' @entity14 looks shocked he stammers in disbelief : ' i have no idea what is going on			1
could n't you have waited until the end of my set ? ' one retorts : ' obviously not			0
honestly , shut the f * * * up ' silence			1
' who ? me ? ' @entity14 asks			2
' oooh ... are you yelling at me ? ' he tentatively replied			0
' shut your mouth , all right ? ' the officer snapped			0
shocked : when they left @entity14 gaped at his audience members in shock , ' what the f * * * just happened ! ' popular venue : the @entity27 in @entity33 saw an unusual interruption for comic @entity14 at this point @entity14 apologized and waited for the officers to leave - as the audience wooped and cheered			1
a video , posted on @entity14 's @entity90 profile , shows the comic then exclaiming : ' what the f * * * just happened ! ' i 've dealt with hecklers before and i can put a heckler in their place , i can do that , but if i yelled " you shut the fuck up " to a police officer ... ? ' if an audience said ' shut the f * * * up ' i would 've gone crazy , but when a police officer yells ' shut the f * * * up " i 'm like " yes sorry ! ' .			1
