@entity1 's space authorities have announced plans to launch over 40 different spacecrafts into orbit in 20 separate launches this year			1
one of the vessels to be launched is the ground - breaking @entity7 1 - also known as the ' space bus ' - which can launch 10 different satellites at once			1
2013 was a massive year for @entity1 whose scientists launched 16 spacecraft to firmly establish their cosmic credentials			0
in october 2003 , it became only the third country in history to independently launch a manned mission into space on the @entity19			1
ground - breaking : one of the 40 aircraft @entity1 plans to put into orbit is the @entity24 1 ' space bus ' which can carry 10 satellites into space and restart its engines over 20 times historic : in december 2013 , @entity1 's @entity31 lunar probe became the first object to soft - land on the moon since the @entity36 's @entity35 in 1976 a spokesman for the @entity38 said the vessels going up this year will mostly be ' communication satellites ' orbiting at around 36,000ft			1
director of its @entity42 added : ' there will also be some remote sensing satellites sent up to observe the earth as well as navigation satellites			0
' @entity1 space authorities also said a number of ' cutting edge ' technologies will be tested for the first time , including the highly anticipated ' space bus '			1
the @entity54 is @entity1 's largest ever rocket with a diameter of 5.2 meters			2
it needs to be assembled at the launch site because trains carrying it would not be able to pass through tunnels			0
its engine can restart over 20 times when flying in orbit and it is thought to be 75 per cent more efficient than spacecraft of the same size			2
it also has the capability to move old , scrapped satellites out of useful orbit and into so - called ' cemetery orbits ' to prevent them from hindering other space - faring vehicles			0
in december 2013 , the @entity31 lander - named after the @entity1 moon goddess - became the first object to soft - land on the moon since the @entity36 's @entity35 in 1976			1
@entity1 's @entity78 operated the mission which incorporated a robotic lander and the country 's first ever lunar rover			2
exploration : in june 2012 , the @entity84 carried @entity1 's first female astronaut @entity85 into space @entity87 : a spokesman for the @entity38 said the vessels going up this year will mostly be ' communication satellites ' the county announced its aspiration to carry out deep space exploration in september 2010 and planned to send a man to the moon by 2025			2
mr @entity96 says work is also continuing to extend @entity1 's lunar program , adding : ' we have made breakthroughs in most of the key technology needed for the chang'e - 5 mission [ which is expected to land on the @entity103 by 2017 ]			0
' this year we will conduct more ground tests , particularly ones involving theconditions which will imitate the environment on the moon			0
' meanwhile , the @entity1 government has already begun opening up its its lunar exploration program to private investment .			0
