how @entity0 met their demise remains a long standing mystery for historians			1
one theory is that early modern humans ' bullied ' their @entity0 cousins to the point of extinction because they had better tools to survive			1
but a new study of ancient stone tools contradicts this theory by suggesting human weapons were no better than those created by @entity0			1
the researchers studied stone tools that were used by people in the @entity18 culture and the @entity20 culture , living in south and west @entity21 and west @entity22 around 40,000 years ago			1
they found the human tools ( pictured ) were no more effective than @entity0 - created tools of the same era researchers say the discovery means we may need to rethink the reasons humans survived @entity0 - and that we may not have behaved as differently as we thought			1
traditionally , scientists believed that innovation in weapons enabled humans to spread out of @entity34 to @entity21			2
but the new study by @entity36 and the @entity37 in @entity38 argues @entity0 were just as well - equipped as their human counterparts			1
' we 're not so special , i do n't think we survived @entity0 simply because of technological competence , ' said dr @entity42 , first author of the study from @entity36 , @entity38			1

@entity0 ( reconstruction right ) may not have been as dim - witted as first believe , claims the study the @entity18 culture used small stone points as tips for hunting weapons like throwing spears			1
researchers previously considered these to be an important innovation - one that helped the humans migrate from west @entity22 to @entity21 , where @entity0 were living early modern humans expanded the geographic area they inhabited out of @entity34 during a period of time 55,000 - 40,000 years ago			1

they are often depicted as dim - witted evolutionary losers , but @entity0 were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains			2
. instead , it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors , scientists believe			0
an analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding @entity0 and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought			0
many researchers believe the differences between the two human species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the @entity0			1
neanderthals have been found to make stone tools and even made jewellery			0
eight talons taken from a white - tailed eagle found at @entity0 site in @entity97 in @entity98 were used to create a necklace or bracelet 130,000 years ago			2
however , the new research reveals a timeline that does n't support this theory			0
if the innovation had led to the migration , evidence would show the stone points moving in the same direction as the humans			2
but the study showed the possibility that the stone points appeared in @entity21 3,000 years earlier than in the @entity46 , a historical area in west @entity22			0
' we looked at the basic timeline revealed by similar stone points , and it shows that humans were using them in @entity21 before they appeared in the @entity46 - the opposite of what we 'd expect if the innovation had led to the humans ' migration from @entity34 to @entity21 , ' said dr @entity42			2
' our new findings mean that the research community now needs to reconsider the assumption that our ancestors moved to @entity21 and succeeded where @entity0 failed because of cultural and technological innovations brought from @entity34 or west @entity22			0
' they believe the timings imply several new scenarios about the migration of modern humans into @entity21			0
for example , they are likely to have migrated to @entity21 much earlier , and developed the tools there			0
' we 're very excited about our new model			0
we think the causes of human evolution are more complicated than just being about technology			0
' now that we 've re-examined the traditional model about the northern migration route to @entity21 , we are planning to re-evaluate the model on the southern migration route - from @entity34 to @entity22 ' said dr @entity42 .			0

@entity38 researchers studied ancient stone weapons created by humans
they were no more effective than @entity0 - created tools of same era
suggests humans and @entity0 may not have behaved that differently
contradicts theory that human hunting led to the demise of @entity0
