the four sisters at the centre of @entity3 's largest abduction case have come through the ordeal as happy and well - adjusted children			2
despite being embroiled in the very public and traumatic feud where the @entity9 girls were dragged kicking and screaming from their mother 's home in the middle of the night to go back to live with their father in 2012 , the girls have established healthy and happy lives in @entity15 and speak to their mum every night			1
60 minutes reporter @entity17 interviewed the two eldest girls , @entity19 and @entity20 , who she described as elegant , gracious , reserved and studious , at their home near @entity22 and they expressed their regret for the way they handled the dramatic exit			1
' they are really well , really centred and settled , ' she said			0
' they are elegant , gracious , reserved and studious , ' 60 minutes reporter @entity17 told @entity66			1
' they are very calm			0
' @entity17 said the girls were somewhat aware of the hysteria the distressing scenes of their exit caused and ' have a bit of regret about how they handled it ... so public and being so vehement , but they were manipulated '			1
the girls are living positive and fruitful lives , attending school six days a week , talking about what they will study at university and going out with their @entity15 boyfriends in @entity22			1

' this scene of one of the @entity97 girls in apparent distress outside her father 's villa in @entity22 after the four sisters were taken back from @entity3 to @entity15 @entity19 and @entity37 ( pictured ) are now aged 16 and 17 and are living in @entity15 with their father the story was that the girls had been taken from their abusive father back in @entity15 to hide out in @entity3 and now they were being sent back to the ' monster ' against their will			1
the scenes of the girl 's forced return caused widespread outcry , particularly as the girls ' mother portrayed the cruelty of the @entity115 , and the girls - then aged nine to 14 years old - frightened and distraught			2
that was in 2012 and it seemed unbelievable to many @entity3 who watched the scenes play out that the girls were legally being returned to their @entity15 father as approved under @entity15 law			1
what had been lost in the drama was the fact that the four sisters had earlier been taken by their mother from @entity15 without the knowledge or permission of that father , @entity128 , and that the girls had been born in @entity15 and spent the greater part of their young lives there			1
now 60 minutes has returned to the village near @entity22 where the girls have been living with their @entity15 @entity115 and interview the two elder girls , @entity19 and @entity37 and talked to them about their lives and the dramatic circumstances in which they were apparently wrenched from their mother , @entity58			1

ms @entity58 gave birth to four healthy girls , but in 2007 when the youngest was only around four years old she split from @entity55			0
under @entity15 law , both parents were granted equal custody			2
in 2010 , @entity58 told @entity55 she wanted to take the girls back to @entity3 for a vacation			1
ms @entity58 told the @entity3 embassy in @entity15 entirely different story , that she was fleeing an abusive husband and father and she needed their assistance			2
despite claims by the girls ' mother than they were not happy in @entity15 , the sisters now seem settled and leading good lives with father @entity55 once back in @entity3 , ms @entity58 and her daughters settled down to life in @entity154 for two years , until the dramatic scenes which saw them returned to @entity15			1
now aged twelve to 17 , the young women behave in complete contrast to the screaming , hysterical girls captured on camera in 2012			0
just a day after being taken to their father 's villa on the outskirts of @entity22 , the two older girls were filmed running to the front gates when they saw media camped outside and pleaded for reporters to help them return to @entity3			2
