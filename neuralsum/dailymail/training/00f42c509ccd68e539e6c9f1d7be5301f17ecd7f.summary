@entity0 scored a hat - trick before standing in as an inept emergency goalkeeper			1
but his chaotic game was merely a secondary tale			0
this match , this night , belonged to @entity6 and his brilliant ‘ rabona ’ goal			1
the @entity9 cost @entity10 £ 30million			1
his goal might well be replayed more than 30 million times			0
everyone at @entity15 had to do a double - take			2
words can not do it justice			0
‘ you could probably find a video on @entity24 of me scoring a goal like that , ’ joked @entity10 manager @entity21			1
‘ it was a big goal , a great goal , an unbelievable goal			0
i ’m very happy for him to score a goal like this			0
he practises it every day in training			0
it ’s a goal only a player with his skill can score			0
’ in a strange way , @entity36 were happy @entity6 scored such a sensational goal against them , possibly the best moment produced by a @entity10 player since @entity114 ripped @entity115 to pieces			1
from the outset , the @entity117 looked happy just to be at @entity15 , soaking in the occasion by taking selfies on the pitch and mingling with travelling supporters ahead of kick - off			1
they did create the first clear opportunity when @entity78 bore down on @entity54 ’s goal , but , under pressure from @entity127 , dragged his strike horribly wide			2
@entity0 then followed suit , firing a long - range effort wide 30 seconds later			2
the @entity117 should have heeded that warning , though , as @entity0 put @entity10 ahead from a similar position			1
picking up the ball 25 yards out , the @entity134 under 21 star unleashed a right - foot rocket that flew past @entity72 in the 13th minute			1
yet , the @entity117 refused to hide , going close to an equaliser in the 26th minute after @entity94 ’ header from @entity80 ’s deep free - kick flew narrowly wide			1
they went even closer two minutes later , @entity58 clearing @entity83 ’s effort off the line after a rare error by @entity54			2
but then came a moment that will become an internet sensation as @entity6 brought the house down with his wondrous goal — not that you would have guessed from the reaction of @entity21 , who sat motionless on the bench			2
‘ i never show emotion when we score , ’ he said			0
‘ i always try to stay calm — but when i see it again i will enjoy it			0
maybe , @entity6 can finally start to consistently show the undoubted talent that prompted @entity10 to break their transfer record to sign him from @entity156 last summer			2
yet , just six minutes later , he showed the inconsistency that has been a source of frustration			0
as @entity10 broke after a @entity36 corner , @entity6 needed only to play a simple pass to put @entity64 free on goal			1
instead , he passed to @entity0 , who was offside			0
@entity162 saw a 30 - yard strike fly inches wide in the 40th minute and @entity6 ’s deflected drive from the edge of the box bounced wide during the opening stages of the second half			1
@entity0 puts @entity10 ahead in the 13th minute against @entity117 side @entity36 in the @entity37 tie @entity0 scores a goal against @entity36 during their @entity37 match at @entity15 on thursday night @entity0 celebrates putting @entity10 ahead in the 13th minute as the @entity174 club took their chances at @entity15 the first reported rabona was by @entity177 in @entity9 in a game between @entity179 and @entity180 in 1948			1
@entity182 @entity181 then set up a front cover showing @entity177 dressed as a pupil with the caption ' @entity177 played hooky ' ( ' rabona ' in @entity189 means to play hooky or to skip school )			0
hence , the rabona was born			0
but it proved to be the @entity9 ’s night as he increased the advantage in the 65th minute with an excellently executed left - foot volley that flew past @entity72			2
that was far from the end of the action , however , as @entity0 ’s night ended in a whirlwind			2
he grabbed his second from close range after @entity72 failed to hold @entity61 ’s effort in the 75th minute and completed his hat - trick nine minutes from time by heading home @entity56 ’s cross			1
but the drama was n’t over for @entity0 as he was forced to the spend the final three minutes in goal after @entity54 was sent off for bringing down @entity82			1
and the forward made a complete hash of dealing with @entity92 ’s free - kick , letting the effort go under his body as the @entity117 grabbed a late consolation			1
on the red card , @entity21 added : ‘ i think @entity54 was correct , but unlucky because it was a red card			0
‘ but i am not happy with the last minutes because our defensive line was very high and we gave them the possibility to play in behind our defensive line			0
’ who said the @entity37 was boring ? @entity6 's second - a volley after some clever footwork - puts @entity10 3 - 0 up against their @entity117 counterparts on thursday night @entity6 celebrates securing his brace against the @entity117 side - both of the @entity230 midfielder 's goals were impressive efforts @entity0 celebrates yet another goal as the 21 - year - old @entity134 under 21 striker secured his hat - trick against the @entity117 side hat - trick hero @entity0 ( left ) swaps shirts with @entity54 after the @entity10 goalkeeper is sent off in the 87th minute @entity0 , having replaced the sent - off @entity54 , slightly spoiled his night by letting this shot squirm underneath his body @entity92 , the @entity36 substitute , scored against make - shift goalkeeper @entity0 after all three substitutions were used @entity0 , with goalkeeper top and captain 's armband on , takes the match ball following his hat - trick @entity6 , @entity10 's @entity246 , was involved at the beginning and end of an excellent ' rabona ' goal			1
