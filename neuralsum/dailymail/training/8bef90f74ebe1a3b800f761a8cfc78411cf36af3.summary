by @entity0 drunks could be charged for ending up in @entity2 under proposals being considered in @entity4			1
the country ’s health minister has said there is ‘ merit ’ to the fees and they could free - up staff to treat seriously ill patients			1
officials at the @entity14 in @entity15 insist there are no plans for charges here but some experts are in favour			1
in @entity15 last year a total of 1.22 million patients were admitted to hospital for alcohol - related illnesses or injuries , double the number in 2002/3 @entity27 , @entity4 ’s health minister , said he was concerned about the number of people requiring treatment as a result of their own irresponsible behaviour			1
‘ the @entity33 has a great principle of health care , free at the point of need to all who need it irrespective of their ability to pay for it			2
’ he said ‘ i think it is a wonderful principle but i think on occasions it is abused and we sometimes need to look at how we can make sure that abuse does n't take place			0
’ referring to patients being charged if they needed treatment as a result of alcohol or drugs , mr @entity27 said : ‘ the principle of it has merit			1
‘ the implementation of it is more challenging			0
‘ we need to ensure that people who need medical care are not put off receiving that medical care			0
’ the proposals could see drunks being made to pay a fine every time they went to @entity2 or having to cover their treatment			1
having your stomach pumped after excess alcohol , for example can cost between £ 600 and £ 3,500 in @entity15 last year a total of 1.22 million patients were admitted to hospital for alcohol - related illnesses or injuries , double the number in 2002/3			2
the @entity76 now spends £ 3.5billion a year treating patients for the effects of alcohol , more than twice as much as 2001 when it was just £ 1.47billion			2
in june , senior nurses from the @entity82 of @entity83 said drunks should be banned from @entity2 as they divert care from the elderly and other seriously ill patients			2
revellers who burden the @entity76 after turning up drunk at @entity2 should be charged , @entity4 's health minister @entity27 has suggested dr @entity91 , general secretary of the @entity92 , proposed sending them to drunk tanks – rooms or units in city centres – where they could sober up without creating a disturbance in hospital			1
he added : ' they say there was a time when this was a friday or saturday phenomenon but it 's now round - the - week , ' he said			0
' there 's hardly a time when there is n't someone with an alcohol problem in an @entity2 department			2
' speaking at the @entity92 's annual conference in @entity112 , he added : ' it 's a contemporary problem , more and more people - not just young people , people of all ages , are drinking too much			0
' there is no doubt the country has a significant problem			0
' we now have the highest rates of liver disease and alcohol - related illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and oesophageal problems			0
' people that come in inebriated require a lot of nursing care and that detracts from nurses being able to care for others			0
' people are coming in , perhaps they 've been in a fight , there 's blood everywhere , they 're careering around , it can make things very difficult			0
' a @entity14 spokesperson : ‘ with more than one million alcohol - related hospital admissions in the last year we know too many people are drinking too much and that alcohol places a heavy burden on the @entity76 in @entity15 , costing around £ 3.5bn every year			1
‘ there are no plans to charge drunk people to use @entity2			1
however , we have made sure there are powers in place to enable those who abuse staff to be removed			0
