many couples disagree over what to name their children — but one @entity5 couple ’s battle over their unborn baby ’s moniker became so unbearable that they have asked random members of the public to help them reach a decision			2
@entity11 , who is due in august , wants to name her unborn child @entity12 , after her late father			1
her husband @entity14 prefers the @entity16 name @entity17 , after his own father			2
because they have been unable to settle their disagreement privately , the couple has turned to the general public to help them make a decision ; @entity14 , 37 , has launched an online petition asking for help to sway his wife			1
baby name showdown : @entity14 and @entity11 ca n't agree over whether to name their child @entity17 or @entity12 , which @entity14 says his wife will shorten to @entity33 ' the argument is serious — it ’s not a joke , ' @entity11 , 33 , told the @entity37			1
' i do n’t want to call my son something i ca n’t even pronounce			0
' according to the petition , @entity11 finds the name @entity44 ' archaic , base , bereft of elegance and unsuitable for a child living in 21st century @entity47 '			1
but @entity14 argues that his wife simply has not had the opportunity to grow to like the name , and that her ' @entity51 ear is not trained for the sweet , musical sounds of our @entity16 nomenclature '			0
@entity56 history : @entity14 says the name @entity17 ' has been held by the highest and most honored officials and patriots of both the @entity47 and the @entity60 ' however , the nights of ' bickering about it back and forth ' may be moot : the couple does not even know for sure whether they are even having a son			2
' my husband is convinced			0
he thinks he ’s a psychic ... he thinks he can see through the belly , ' says @entity11			0
in fact , if the couple has a girl , @entity14 is willing to let @entity11 choose the name ; he also says that if they name their first born son @entity17 , his wife can choose the name of their second son			1
mystery child : the couple does n't yet know the sex of their baby ; if it 's a girl , @entity84 will surrender all naming rights to @entity11 while they wait to find out , @entity14 is hoping to get 100,000 signatures supporting his choice — the magic number that his wife agreed would be enough for him to get his way			1
' i ’ll settle for 100,000 — this is an approximate population of my hometown @entity96 , ' says @entity11 , who was born in @entity97			0
@entity14 is still far off from his goal , but his nuanced plea has so far garnered over 200 supporters .			0

@entity102 , 37 , of @entity103 , @entity5 wants his *future* son to be called @entity44 , after his father
his wife , @entity11 , 33 , does n't like the ' archaic ' name and prefers to call their child @entity12
@entity14 needs his online petition to earn 100,000 signatures for his wife to *relent*
*ironically* , the couple do n’t actually know for certain that they are having a boy
