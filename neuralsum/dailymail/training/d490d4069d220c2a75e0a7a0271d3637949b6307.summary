his father is a @entity2 scientist			1
his mother is a @entity4 former economist who looks after the elderly			1
his older brother is a doctor who moonlights as a rapper			2
clearly the upbringing of @entity9 , @entity10 ’s exciting winger , was anything but typical as the four of them were crammed together in a small flat on @entity16 ’s rough @entity15 estate			1
but that was the perfect environment to prepare the @entity19 player for the unusual pathway his career has presented			1
from fearing for his future in the game while struggling with a long - term knee injury and without a club aged 19 , to moving to @entity27 under the tutelage of @entity29 , eventually to earn a @entity10 call - up and score against @entity33 winners @entity34 this september			1
his southern @entity49 accent , with a @entity51 edge , belies that @entity37 estate he grew up on			2
it was after the move to @entity55 that a kid on the playground spotted this tiny — @entity41 is only 5ft 5in now — but rapid player who effortlessly skipped past his opponents and invited him to join his team @entity61			1
@entity41 remains in touch with the boy ’s father , @entity65 , his first manager at @entity67 , and his assistant @entity68			1
@entity65 bought @entity41 his first football boots			1
‘ i remember the first meeting vividly , ’ @entity41 recalls			1
‘ i was small and he was this fully grown man asking me if i wanted to play for the team			2
he really helped me with my football			2
i ’m hoping to get him one of my shirts from the @entity55 game			1
’ @entity19 winger @entity41 has become a @entity10 regular under manager @entity78 @entity79 ( 2004 - 07 ) @entity80 ( 2007 - 08 ) @entity81 ( 2008 ) @entity82 ( 2009 ) @entity83 ( 2009 - 10 ) @entity84 ( 2010 - 11 ) @entity85 ( 2011 ) @entity86 ( 2011 - 13 ) @entity87 - loan ( 2011 - 12 ) @entity19 - loan ( 2012 - 13 ) @entity19 ( 2013 - present ) an eight - year - old @entity41 nervously asked his parents for permission			1
playing football was not befitting of his father ’s household			2
it rankled with the education - centred ethos of @entity97 , who is a doctor of metallurgy and who had taken the family to @entity47 to work for the university , but his mother backed him and has done so ever since			1
‘ @entity103 was very strict on me and my brother @entity104 , ’ @entity41 explains			1
‘ with his @entity106 roots he was all about education			2
after school we had to study extra hours			2
‘ when i decided i wanted to pursue football at 14 my dad did n’t really approve			2
that was when instead of doing an hour after school studying i would only do that hour if my dad was in the house			2
my love for football developed as my attention and application to school work went the other way			2
’ @entity123 drove her son to every training session and was there on the touchline for every match			2
she is still at almost all his games now			0
@entity97 still only watches the occasional match on television			0
@entity41 ’s mother supported him when @entity79 released him after his first two - year professional contract ended in 2007			1
he was without a club and struggling with a persistent knee problem			0
a young @entity41 gets ready to make an appearance for @entity79 in 2005 @entity41 played for sides such as @entity81 and @entity82 before joining @entity19 spells at non-league @entity80 and @entity81 kept him playing , before the opportunity to join the @entity141 arose			1
the academy is now closed but it proved a turning point in @entity41 ’s career			1
he was recommended for a trial by his former @entity79 manager @entity146 , who had been assistant manager to @entity29 with @entity55			1
he was accepted and left the family behind to fly to @entity148 in @entity27 to join the academy			2
‘ the academy was really only for players released from @entity151 clubs who had not made it initially			1
but because of @entity146 ’s relationship he helped me			0
‘ the whole idea of the academy was that @entity29 felt players were judged too early			1
it was like a training camp and we had friendlies against teams in the area like @entity83 and @entity164			0
’ @entity41 had a brief five - month spell at @entity82 and they offered him a longer - term deal but after impressing @entity83 in two friendlies he signed a two - year contract with their b team , then spent three years living in @entity27 , moving to @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87			1
@entity41 plied his trade at @entity174 outfit @entity82 before his spell out in @entity27 there are 23 players based in @entity55 in the @entity10 squad			1
the exceptions are @entity180 , @entity181 , @entity182 ( all @entity183 ) and @entity184 ( @entity185 )			0
‘ it was hard to begin with , ’ he remembers			0
‘ i did n’t know the language so i was training then going straight home			0
that ’s when my dad ’s influence helped			0
i knew i had to learn @entity192			0
after training i would teach myself			0
life got better as i got better at it			0
’ the chance to return to @entity55 came when @entity19 took him on a season - long loan from @entity86 , which turned into a three - year permanent deal signed last year			1
his performances in the @entity199 , where he began showcasing his blistering pace and dribbling , meant a call - up to the @entity37 national team soon followed			2
@entity41 is 26 , in footballing terms a late developer to the international scene , but the pinnacle , so far , was scoring against @entity33 winners @entity34 in @entity208 in september			1
@entity10 lost 2 - 1 , but his goal will live long in the memory			1
@entity41 had started sprinting from the halfway line down the left when released by @entity213			1
three @entity214 were in tow but his sheer speed meant none of them got close			0
@entity41 took only two touches to take the ball into the area and then side - foot it around goalkeeper @entity223 and in			1
he has not stopped watching replays since			0
the @entity37 winger beats @entity34 goalkeeper @entity223 with his brilliant striker in september @entity41 remains close to his family			1
although he spoke little to his brother , now 30 , growing up , they have become friends and , along with @entity104 ’s girlfriend @entity232 , @entity41 describes the trio as ‘ @entity234 ’			1
he is a devout @entity235 and attends church regularly , when football permits			0
he went on sunday with his godparents			0
his mother drove the 12 - hour , 720 - mile round trip from @entity47 to @entity16 ’s @entity241 to see him play in @entity10 ’s @entity43 qualifying win against the @entity243 on friday night			1
and she will make the journey again when they host @entity55 on tuesday			2
' she was pushing me to play football , believed in me from day one and has been there through good and bad , ’ @entity41 says			2
‘ she always looked at me as if i was the best player in the world			0
with that kind of confidence you ca n’t go wrong			0
‘ my brother ’s great passion is music			0
but the difference between me and my brother is when dad had him pursing education , he was n’t strong enough to say he wanted to do his own thing			0
i think he ’ll admit that			0
he did what my dad wanted and became a doctor			0
’ @entity266 ( left ) celebrates with @entity267 and @entity41 after a goal for @entity10 against @entity269 @entity234 will perhaps become four — true to @entity271 ’s 19th - century novel — when @entity41 stops playing			1
he is single at the moment and puts that down to his commitment to the game			0
‘ i ’m all about football , football , football , ’ he says			0
‘ i ’m trying my hardest to get to the highest level			0
when i hang my boots up i want to have done everything i can : eat right , recovered right , live right , sacrificed everything to let me become as good as i can			0
‘ but i know football does n’t last for ever			0
what do i want to do on this earth ? now , i want to play football , but when i get older , what would give me satisfaction ? time is still on my side			0
hopefully it will come to me			0
’ would he consider finally following his father into education and academia ? he laughs and adds : ‘ i ’ve passed that stage			2
the brain is like any other muscle : you use it or lose it			0
i was intelligent once , i ’m not so intelligent any more			0
