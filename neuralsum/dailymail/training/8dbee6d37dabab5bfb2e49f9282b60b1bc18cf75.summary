suicide : an autopsy report has confirmed that director @entity2 killed himself in august filmmaker @entity2 had anti-depressants and sleeping pills when he killed himself by jumping off a bridge in august , an autopsy report revealed on monday			1
the report by the @entity9 coroner confirmed that the @entity12 director 's death was a suicide , and listed the cause of death as multiple blunt force injuries			1
it said that he also drowned after leaping from the @entity19 into @entity9 harbour on august 19			1
@entity2 had therapeutic levels of the anti-depressant @entity22 and the sleep aid @entity24 in his system when he died , the report has revealed			1
it has long been assumed that the director had killed himself , as he left a number of apparent suicide notes in his car when he died			1
however , the notes did not suggest any motive for the suicide , and his death certificate did not initially list a cause			1
initial reports that he had been suffering from terminal brain cancer have now been confirmed to be incorrect			1
' there was no evidence of neoplasia - cancer - identified , ' coroner @entity40 told the @entity44			1
he added that @entity2 did not appear to have been suffering from any serious long - term illness at all			0
911 tapes released earlier this month revealed that at least five female motorists reported seeing @entity2 leap to his death			1
the 68 - year - old filmmaker committed suicide by jumping off @entity19 , linking the @entity51 and @entity52 , in broad daylight on august 19 in full view of boaters and passing drivers			1
disheveled : @entity2 was pictured looking pained as he dined out in @entity57 on july 23 ‘ we are just on the @entity19 and there ’s a guy that looks like he ’s just about to jump off … he ’s jumped , he ’s jumped , [ off ] the @entity19 in @entity63 ! ’ said one 911 caller			0
another witness reported the fatal leap to 911 operators , and was then transferred to a fire dispatcher			0
during the transfer , she could be heard gasping : ‘ @entity69			0
’ the caller said : ‘ he was a bald white guy			0
oh my gosh , he just jumped off the bridge			1
we actually witnessed the whole thing			0
’ motorists driving over the bridge reported seeing a black @entity78 , lights still flashing , parked on the side , as an older white male climbed a pole before leaping more than 185 feet into the water			2
@entity2 had been preparing to do a sequel to his 1986 @entity84 hit @entity12			0
he and @entity84 were spotted in @entity85 , @entity86 — where the @entity88 ’s @entity12 program had been based before moving to @entity90 — meeting with @entity88 officials , a week before the suicide			2
unclear : his death certificate initially failed to list a cause of death for the well - known director coroner 's office spokesman @entity97 says one of the notes left in @entity2 's black @entity78 was a list of emergency contact numbers and another found in his study included messages to friends and loved ones			1
the note in the car listed names and contact numbers - including that of his wife - so police could call his friends to tell them of his death , @entity107 reported			2
brother : @entity118 is pictured here at his office in @entity120 in the days following his brothers death the mystery surrounding the suicide deepened after the chairman of @entity126 said that the director was ' burning with excitement ' over new projects just two weeks before his suicide			1
' we had a meeting just two weeks ago and he was burning with the excitement of creating stuff , ' said @entity136			0
@entity2 had more big - budget @entity120 films lined up , but his death has left them in limbo , as well as stunning his family and friends			2
friends of the director said that he had no marriage or money problems and was focused on the ' @entity12 ' sequel which was preparing to go into production early next year			2
@entity2 was also in pre-production on an underwater drug - trafficking thriller ' @entity149 ' , another smuggling drama ' @entity151 ' and a remake of the 1969 western ' @entity153 '			0
while celebrity website @entity107 reported that @entity2 's wife did n't know of any serious illness that may have been a motive , it raised the possibility that the director of @entity160 may have kept his illness secret			1
if not there must have been a different reason behind his decision to leap from the @entity19 in @entity52 on sunday afternoon			0
he left a contact list of people to be informed about the tragedy in the @entity78 he abandoned before climbing a fence and jumping into the @entity169			2
the director was said to have leaped to his death ' without hesitation ' in an effort to spare his family the pain of watching his slow death , @entity170 reported			1
but hours later , @entity170 backed away from that report and the @entity44 confirmed that @entity2 's family told the corner 's office @entity2 did not have cancer - or any major illness			1
' the family told us it is incorrect that he has inoperable brain cancer , ' @entity40 , a chief at the @entity184 told the newspaper			2
tragic : @entity9 polie officers pulled the body of @entity2 from the water beneath the @entity19 in @entity63 , @entity193 the denial of his brain cancer begs the question - what could have driven the successful director , whose films have grossed more than $ 2 billion and who left behind a young family , to kill himself ? @entity2 's tragic death came just weeks after he was pictured looking pained as he left a @entity57 restaurant on july 23 - but friends denied he had problems in his marriage to wife @entity207			1
a source told the @entity209 : ' he did have cancer , and for a while he was cancer free			2
he did n’t have any money problems or marriage problems			0
' the beloved filmmaker , who directed movies including @entity12 , @entity216 and @entity217 and was the younger brother of director @entity118 , fell within feet of a cruise boat as horrified tourists watched			2
' he landed right next to our tour boat , and many of us saw the whole thing , ' a witness , who had been on the cruise around the @entity227 , told @entity107			0
according to the @entity228 , @entity2 climbed a fence on the south side of the bridge , which spans @entity63 and @entity232 , and leaped off ' without hesitation '			2
a view of the @entity19 in @entity63 , @entity193 from where @entity2 jumped to his death a witness , who was a passenger in a car driving along the bridge , said @entity2 looked nervous			1
' he was on the roadway close to the fence looking around			0
he was looking around and fumbling with something at his feet			0
he looked nervous , ' @entity244 told the @entity44			0
@entity244 thought he was a stuntman or taking part in an extreme sports event - until he realised there was no safety cord			0
he went on : ' [ @entity249 ] paused a couple of seconds and then began to climb the fence			0
he put his foot on the top of the fence and paused again			0
then he threw himself off			0
i immediately thought , that guy is dead			0
' friends told the @entity209 they were not surprised that the director chose to leap to his death as he was a thrill - seeker who loved scaling high mountains			1
