@entity0 admits the figures do not bear scrutiny but he is certain that @entity3 have not slipped backwards during the last 12 months			1
last @entity5 , @entity0 ’s side were nicely poised in second place in the @entity7 , with 36 points from 17 games and trailing leaders @entity11 only on goal difference			1
yet , despite a summer outlay of more than £ 70million on @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and back - up goalkeeper @entity19 , they are nine points worse off than this time last season and 15 points adrift of leaders @entity25			1
@entity0 has insisted that his @entity3 team has not regressed in the last 12 months @entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t think that we have gone backwards in the quality of our squad because if you look at the five players that we bought , you can not say that one of the five players is a failure			1
‘ i ca n’t deny that we are behind much more than last year because we had a depleted squad since the start of the season , and no stability , and the fact that we got so many important injuries at the back cost us too much			2
‘ we lost @entity17 and ( @entity44 ) @entity43 at the same period for three months			2
’ from dreaming of winning their first title since the @entity48 campaign of 2003 - 04 , @entity3 are preparing for another anxious fight to extend their proud @entity51 record to 18 consecutive years			1
however , the manager , having broken a nine - year trophy drought by winning the @entity54 last season , is not prepared to give up on the @entity7 title just yet			1
@entity57 heads in @entity11 's dramatic late equaliser in the @entity7 clash at @entity60 @entity0 highlighted the recent additions to his squad such as former @entity63 forward @entity15 @entity0 said : ‘ let ’s see how the schedule goes over @entity5			1
we will have a much better idea at the beginning of january			2
the next three or four games are important			2
‘ @entity25 will be in the fight for the title , for sure			0
will it only be @entity25 and @entity74 ? today you can say maybe , but it is still a long way			0
@entity25 play @entity51 , @entity74 do as well			0
then you have the @entity54 and @entity25 also play in the @entity77			0
there is still a long way to go			0
‘ what is for sure is that teams like us , and those around us , need to be massively consistent to have a chance to come back			0
at the moment , it ’s better if i do n’t talk too much and we perform on the pitch			0
still , he is without half a dozen first - team regulars going into the game at home to @entity93 but all except @entity94 are expected back before the end of january			1
the @entity3 boss also attributes some of his problems to the @entity98 , which he believes has influenced players physically and mentally			1
the @entity101 boss has received heavy criticism from some sections of the club 's supporters @entity3 midfielder @entity94 is again out with an ankle injury after a heavy challenge from @entity108 ‘ after the @entity98 , we had too many players who were not at their level , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ too many came back not ready to compete again			0
then you look again at the number of players we lost when they were just back to their best			0
‘ we had no @entity116 , no @entity94 , no @entity117 , no @entity17 , no @entity43 , no @entity118 for too long periods			0
no @entity120 for three months			0
it ’s like you have half of the squad out ! ’ @entity0 still believes the best way to address these problems of fatigue is to introduce a mid- season break to relieve the relentless grind of @entity131 football , although he would like to see it in the new year to protect the traditional festive fixtures			1
‘ maybe it would be good for the @entity131 national team to have a break , ’ he said			2
‘ respect the @entity131 tradition , and have a break in january			0
if you look at the history , is it a coincidence the @entity143 team have always done well in big tournaments when @entity131 have n’t done so well ? @entity143 has the longest winter break in @entity146 , out of the big countries			2
and by coincidence , they always do well in tournaments because they have refreshed players			0
’ @entity0 said his team had badly missed players such as @entity17 while they were injured the idea of a winter break in @entity131 has been debated often			1
@entity157 pushed hard for it when he ran the national team , but was unsuccessful			2
it always hits the same obstacles			0
the @entity7 will not vote to reduce the number of teams in the top flight and in turn the @entity166 and the @entity167 are reluctant to surrender @entity54 replays and one leg of the @entity77 semi-final to generate necessary space in a congested calendar where midweek dates are dominated by @entity175 competitions			1
any agreement is still hard to imagine , not least because many fear clubs would abuse a break and see it as merely another chance to squeeze in a commercial tour , disguised as warm - weather training , but managers will often back the principle			2
‘ you do n’t go on tour , but you give them two weeks off and then you prepare like the @entity143 teams do , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ they stopped on saturday and they come back at the beginning of january			0

@entity3 drew 2 - 2 with @entity11 in their last @entity7 match
the @entity101 are sixth in the league behind @entity195 and @entity196
@entity0 insists his team have not gone backwards in the last year
the @entity200 said his latest *signings* were proof of that
