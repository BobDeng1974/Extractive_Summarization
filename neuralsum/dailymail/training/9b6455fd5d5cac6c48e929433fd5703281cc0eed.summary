students returning back to school after the summer vacation are finding out what first lady @entity4 's new rules for healthy eating in schools , truly mean			1
gone are the the signs marketing high - sugar sodas to thirsty kids , so too are the fattening chips and chocolate			2
instead , those having cravings for all - things - fattening will have to make do with protein bars , vegetable snacks , bottles of mineral water and diet soda			0
mrs @entity4 's new rules which were approved by her husbands administration now see vending machines across the country featuring healthier options in an overall effort to fight obesity			1
will it be derailed by outraged adolescents ? mmm delicious : these snacks may be healthier , but they have irritated students at schools across the country who preferred their diet of chips and sodas with many schools back in session , teens have taken to @entity62 to vent their frustration at the lack of options that the new vending machines provide			1
' @entity4 is single - handedly ruining my life by changing school lunch and the vending machines , ' tweeted one student who was craving calories			1
' how about @entity4 quit worrying about the vending machines and worry about how terrible school lunches are			1
like that ’s cardboard , ' tweeted another angry student			0
some students seem to have taken matters into their own hands , however , and are starting to bring in their favorite sugary snacks from outside of school			0
' smuggling junk food in my purse to school because there ’s only healthy food in the vending machines , ' wrote one @entity62 user			1
the new rules phase out the advertising of sugary drinks and junk foods around campuses during the school day and ensure that other promotions in schools are in line with health standards that already apply to school foods			2
that means a scoreboard at a high school football or basketball game eventually is no longer allowed to advertise @entity106 , for example , but it could advertise @entity108 or @entity110 water , which is also owned by @entity111 the same rules apply to the front of vending machines			1
cups , posters and menu boards which promote foods that do n't meet the standards have been phased out			1
ninety percent of such marketing in schools is related to beverages , and in advance of the new rules coming into effect , many soda companies already began to transition their sales and advertising in schools from sugary sodas and sports drinks to their own healthier products			1
the rules are part of first lady @entity4 's @entity136 initiative to combat child obesity , which is now in its fourth year			1
everything 's bigger in @entity139 : but maybe not for much longer as healthier snacks come into play chosen partner : @entity143 is one of the few fast food brands that will work with the @entity145 to help advance the goals of @entity4 's let 's move ! campaign ' the idea here is simple — our classrooms should be healthy places where kids are n't bombarded with ads for junk food , ' the first lady said in a statement released before the announcement			1
" because when parents are working hard to teach their kids healthy habits at home , their work should n't be undone by unhealthy messages at school			0
' the rules also would allow more children access to free lunches and ensure that schools have wellness policies in place			0
the rules come on the heels of @entity177 regulations that are now requiring foods in the school lunch line to be healthier			0
calorie , fat , sugar and sodium limits have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day at 100,000 schools			2
concessions sold at afterschool sports games are exempt			0
the healthier food rules have come under fire from conservatives who think the government should n't dictate what kids eat — and from some students who do n't like the healthier foods			0
banned : under the new rules , companies are now limited in what products they can advertise on signs , vending machines , cups and menu boards on school grounds aware of the backlash , the @entity177 is allowing schools to make some of their own decisions on what constitutes marketing and asking for comments on some options			1
rules for other school fundraisers , like bake sales and marketing for those events is still up to individual schools or states			0
off - campus fundraisers , like an event at a local fast - food outlet that benefits a school , are still permitted			0
but posters advertising the fast food are no longer allowed in school hallways			0
the rules also makes allowances for major infrastructure costs — that scoreboard advertising @entity106 , for example , wo n't have to be immediately be torn down , but school has to get one with a healthier message the next time its replaced			0
where there 's a will ... students have found other ways to get around the unpopular new rules on school nutrition positive marketing only : @entity240 is the exclusive beverage in city public schools as well as at parks and other public areas			2
for $ 166 million @entity240 will promote @entity245 - all over a five year period , with most money going to the schools )			2
only water and juices will be sold in the schools the beverage industry — led by @entity111 , dr. @entity253 and @entity255 — is on board with the move			0
@entity259 president and ceo @entity258 said in a statement that aligning signage with the healthier drinks that will be offered in schools is the ' logical next step			0
' ' mrs. @entity4 's efforts to continue to strengthen school wellness make sense for the well - being of our schoolchildren , ' @entity258 said			1
although mrs. @entity4 lobbied @entity272 to pass the school nutrition bill in 2010 , most of her efforts in recent years have been focused on the private sector , building partnerships with food companies and retailers to sell healthier foods .			2

first lady has *introduced* new rules that saw companies limited in what products they could advertise on signs , vending machines , cups and menu boards on school grounds
food industry spent nearly $ 150 million in 2009 on marketing in schools , *93* percent was promoting drinks
schools now require drink companies to promote their diet sodas or water on signs and scoreboards , rather than full - calorie options like @entity106 and @entity302
@entity4 's @entity136 *program* is now in its fourth year
