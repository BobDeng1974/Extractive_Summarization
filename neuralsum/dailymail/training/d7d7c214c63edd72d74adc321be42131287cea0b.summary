the male in question has been described as a cheery chap wearing a blue jacket and red hat with a ‘ smiley and hairy expression ’			2
but this is no ordinary missing persons case - because police are investigating the overnight theft of a 3ft garden gnome from a pensioner ’s ornamental front path			1
@entity13 , 81 , had placed the giant gnome named ‘ @entity15 ’ beside the doorstep alongside scores of other ornaments to cheer up his neighbours in @entity20 , @entity21			1
gone : the 3ft gnome called ' @entity15 ' ( bottom right ) was stolen from this home in @entity20 , @entity21			1
this photograph was taken before the theft however the widower was shocked to wake up one morning to find the £ 25 statuette had gone missing - and called in police			1
it is thought the gnome may have been taken for a prank or to sell on			1
retired engineer mr @entity13 said : ‘ i ca n’t believe that someone would do this - and i can only presume that whoever has done this have planned it in advance			1
‘ i ca n’t imagine that they would want to walk through a town centre carrying a giant gnome			1
i just do n’t know why they would steal him			2
if it was youngsters perhaps it was for a joke or prank			2
‘ if someone older , perhaps there is a black market for these things but why risk selling @entity15 off for a tenner and perhaps face the courts if they get found out ? ’ plea : @entity13 , 81 , is pictured outside his home in @entity20 with a sign made by a local woman saying : ' hello , i 'm @entity15 , welcome to my garden ' ‘ one of my neighbours was so upset at the theft she actually rang the police before me			1
we are quite a tight - knit group here			2
' perhaps there is a black market for these things but why risk selling @entity15 off for a tenner and perhaps face the courts if they get found out ? ' @entity13 ‘ the thing is we never have any trouble around here because everyone is elderly			1
i just want these people to bring @entity15 home			0
‘ i do n’t need to speak to them - they can just bring it back during the evening when it is dark and that will be the end of it			0
’ mr @entity13 bought the gnome last march from a local supermarket to add to his 100 - strong collection of ornamental dragons , pandas , dogs , trolls and @entity92 figures			1
police investigation : the widower was shocked to find the £ 25 statuette had gone missing during the night he added : ‘ i collect ornaments for the simple reason that there are a lot of elderly people around here			1
there are at least four people in their 90s and three in their 80s			0
' one of my neighbours was so upset at the theft she actually rang the police before me			1
we are quite a tight - knit group here ' @entity13 ‘ it makes them smile every time they walk past and look at my front door and see all my gnomes - especially “ @entity15 ” smiling back at them			1
‘ one of the ladies here even made a sign saying “ hello , i ’m @entity15 , welcome to my garden			0
” that is the whole point of it			0
they come past and they always have a smile for him			0
‘ @entity15 waves and sometimes you see them wave back as the go by			0
since my wife died three years ago , i did n’t have to answer to anyone querying what i buy			0
plea : @entity134 urged anyone with information about who is responsible to contact the force ‘ my eldest daughter often comes in and says : “ what have you bought now ? ” i say : “ did you see my two new gnomes looking out the window at you ? ” she just laughs and that is what it is all about			0
' we are aware of the incident and we are investigating			0
i urge anyone with information about who is responsible to contact us ' @entity134 spokesman ‘ @entity15 just makes me smile and is one of 100 ornaments			2
i noticed he was missing on saturday morning			1
i opened the door and thought something was wrong here and realised he was n’t there			2
‘ i just felt sorry for people who have to steal things like that			0
i want @entity15 back , not for me but for the people			0
when they come past , they got used to seeing him			0
‘ it ’s like having a missing person in the area			2
i will get another gnome but it wo n’t be the same and it looks like i will have to chain him up			2
’ a @entity134 spokesman said : ‘ we are aware of the incident and we are investigating			0
i urge anyone with information about who is responsible to contact us			0
