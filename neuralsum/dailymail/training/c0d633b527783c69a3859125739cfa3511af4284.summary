@entity0 is the man of the moment down under after securing his fifth @entity3 title in @entity4			1
the @entity5 defeated scot @entity6 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 on sunday to secure his eighth @entity8 crown and has now set his sights on the @entity10 , the only major to currently elude him			1
the @entity11 posed for photographers with the @entity13 on the banks of the @entity15 in @entity4 to toast his success with a glass of champagne			1
@entity3 champion @entity0 kisses the @entity13 by the @entity15 @entity0 won his fifth @entity3 title on sunday after beating @entity21 no 1 @entity6 djokovic smiles holding the @entity13 on the banks of the @entity15 in @entity4 @entity0 has joined an illustrious list of @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26 in winning his eighth grand slam title in the @entity3			1
however the @entity5 has already set his sights on becoming just the eighth player to win all four of the game 's biggest tournaments by claiming a first @entity10 in @entity31			0
' it 's incredible to be able to win eight , ' said @entity0			1
' i still feel as a 27 - year - old i have years to come			0
hopefully if i stay healthy and have this disciplined professionalism and commitment to everyday rituals and things i have been doing the last few years , i think i have a fair chance to get myself in another position to win a grand slam or two or three			0
@entity0 appeared for a photoshoot on monday having secured his fifth @entity3 crown in @entity4 @entity6 congratulates 2015 @entity3 champion @entity0 after their grueling four - set match ' at this point i am happy with where i am in my life and to be able to join the elite group of players like @entity24 and @entity26 who won eight grand slams is quite remarkable and i am very proud of it			1
' most of the players will tell you it 's important to have the mindset that keeps you in the present moment and once something is done you move on and try to focus on the next one and try not to think too much in advance or in the past , because that allows you to work and reset your ambitions and your goals			0
' but i think you have to be honest and say you think about the amount of grand slams you won and tournaments you won and what your place in history is			0
i definitely have that in the back of my mind and i am very pleased with my accomplishments so far			0
' the @entity11 sprays a celebratory bottle of champagne into the @entity15 having won another @entity8 the 27 - year - old offered the photographers some of his champagne during a shoot on monday @entity0 has lost twice to nine - time @entity10 champion @entity77 in the final , last year and 2012 , acknowledging the @entity78 will be the clear favourite in may			1
' i was n't too far from winning a title both times when i lost to @entity77 but it 's a grand slam on the slowest surface that is physically the most demanding one			2
' that 's something that makes it more difficult in terms of winning against @entity77 , he has lost only one match in his entire career which is probably the most impressive record in tennis history of all time			2
' it 's very important ( winning the @entity10 ) but if i do n't succeed in doing that in my career it 's not the @entity95 , but i am definitely going to keep on trying			2
i have been very very close and that allows me to believe i can make that final step and that 's something that keeps me going			2
' @entity6 shouts out in frustration after losing a point during the first set tiebreak in @entity4 on sunday @entity6 had plenty of chances but eventually succumbed to a relentless @entity0 , who won his fifth @entity3 in as many finals			1
despite appearing to struggle physically , which @entity6 admitted after the brutal contest that he was distracted by the @entity11 's antics , @entity0 prevailed in emphatic fashion by winning 12 of the last 13 games , leaving @entity6 defeated for a fourth time in the @entity4 show piece			1
@entity0 has sympathy for his @entity4 final opponent but points to the legendary competition in @entity114 and @entity77 for why they have failed to land more @entity8 titles @entity0 lifts his trophy after wining a remarkable fifth title in his fifth final in @entity120 on sunday ' he is there and if he won a couple more matches he would have maybe five grand slams now and it would be a different story , ' @entity0 added			1
' on the other hand i could as well maybe have won a few more			0
but this is the generation we are in			0
there are four players that are incredibly good and very few points decide the winner			0
' i believe they ( @entity114 and @entity77 ) made me a better player and also @entity6 ; they made me understand what i need to do to improve my game to get on the level where they are			2
' you can maybe think if i was in another era i would be in double figures already , but everything happens for a reason			0
i am sure @entity6 is disappointed not to win a few more grand slams but he is also a better player as a consequence of being a rival of the other three guys			0

@entity0 beat @entity6 7 - 6 , 6 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 0 on sunday
@entity151 's fifth @entity3 title in his fifth final
the @entity11 has now won eight @entity8 titles in his career
