by @entity0 published : 07:49 est , 3 march 2014 updated : 08:08 est , 3 march 2014 a belief in contagion raises prices at auction when it comes to revered celebrities such as @entity8 , a study claims most people think they pay little attention to magic in modern times			1
but a new study has shown that when it comes to celebrities , plenty of people subscribe to the rich and famous instilling everyday objects with their magical ‘ essence ’			0
a belief in contagion – magical thinking in which a person ’s qualities can be transferred to an object – raises prices at auction when it comes to revered celebrities such as @entity8 but lowers them for criminals and fraudsters , researchers claim			1
two psychologists at @entity36 set out to find how the belief in contagion influences the sale of celebrity memorabilia			1
using data from three high - profile estate auctions , @entity40 and @entity41 found that people ’s expectations about the amount of physical contact between an object and a celebrity positively predicts the final bids for items that belonged to well - liked individuals such as president @entity8			1
essentially , people were willing to pay more for items owned by liked celebrities including @entity56 , if they had touched them a lot			1
the study in @entity60 revealed that contagion negatively predicts final bids for items that belonged to disliked individuals , such as financial fraudster @entity65			1
the researchers wrote : ‘ contagion is a form of magical thinking in which people believe that a person 's immaterial qualities or essence can be transferred to an object through physical contact ’ and concluded the belief suggests ‘ that magical thinking may still have effects in contemporary western societies			2
’ people were willing to pay more for items owned by liked celebrities including @entity56 , if they had touched them a lot the study in @entity60 revealed that contagion negatively predicts final bids for items that belonged to disliked individuals , such as financial fraudster @entity65 ( pictured ) volunteers were asked how much they would bid on a hypothetical jumper if it belonged to a celebrity they admired as well as one they disliked			1
people were prepared to pay almost 15 per cent less for a jumper worn by a celebrity if it had been sterilised - destroying the contagion effect			2
they would pay almost 9 per cent less for a jumper that they were not allowed to resell , indicating that most people value the celebrity ‘ essence ’ attached to an item , more than its cash value			2
however , sterilisation boosted the value of a jumper owned by a hated celebrity			0
sterilised items that had belonged to an unpopular celebrity were valued around 17 per cent more valuable than those that had not			0
@entity111 and @entity41 looked at auction prices of 1,297 @entity114 - related items as well as 288 items said to have been owned by @entity56 and 489 related to @entity65			1
descriptions of auction items rarely say whether the item was touched by its owner , so the participants of the study rated how much contact they thought each item might have had with its owner on a scale of one to eight , @entity116 reported			0
the psychologists reasoned that people sitting in an auction house subconsciously do the same thing			0
they discovered a strong link between items thought to have been frequently used by a celebrity - such as a fork or a watch – and the price of items that exceeded auction houses ’ estimates of how much an object would fetch			0
the only exception to their findings were prices paid for incredibly expensive items such as jewellery			0

however , contagion reduced the value of items worn by disliked celebrities			2
watches belonging to @entity65 are pictured for items valued over $ 10,000 , people did not pay any more or less based upon the amount of contact a celebrity might have had with them , indicating that the contagion effect does not influence serious investments			1
the duo also conducted an experiment where 435 volunteers were asked how much they would bid on a hypothetical jumper if it had belonged to a celebrity they like as well as one that they hate			0
‘ when asked to bid on a sweater owned by a well - liked celebrity , participants report that they would pay substantially less if it was sterilised before they received it , ’ destroying the magical contagion effect and a celebrity ’s ‘ essence ’ , the psychologists wrote			1

sterilised items that had belonged to an unpopular celebrity were valued around 17 per cent more valuable than those that had not , suggesting people do not want to be in contact with the ‘ essence ’ .			0
