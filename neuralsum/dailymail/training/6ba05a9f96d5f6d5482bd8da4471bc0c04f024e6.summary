there 's no denying @entity1 is a big wig - but researchers have photographed a caterpillar that bears an uncanny resemblance to the property mogul 's hair			1
with its brightly coloured , carefully parted ' do ' the bizarre looking caterpillar has been compared to the @entity11 property mogul 's unique look			0
the creature was spotted in the @entity13 by friends @entity15 , 34 and @entity16 , 27 , who run photography tours from @entity18 , a 30 bed rainforest lodge in @entity20			1
they are found in @entity26 , southern parts of the @entity11 , and some parts of @entity29			0
this one was found in the @entity13 rainforest who wore it best ? @entity1 's iconic hairstyle bears an uncanny resemblance to the flannel moth the official name of the flannel moth is @entity38			1
it 's also known as a pussy moth , or puss caterpillar , because its hair - like setae resembles a tiny @entity44 cat			1
like @entity1 , it often has a streak of bright orange running through it			1
when the moth is in the early - stages of larvae the ' hair ' is curly and cottony			1
the moth 's hair is actually venomous spines and can cause skin irritations			1
conservation biologist @entity16 and wildlife photographer @entity58 were leading a small group of tourists on a recent tour when @entity16 spotted the insect on a leaf and was so struck by its fluffy mane he could n't resist taking a photo			0
@entity58 said ' on these tours we take tourists and photographers into the @entity13 and point out cool and unusual things for them to photograph			1
' we have been leading photo tours together for two years and have never seen anything as strange as this			0
' @entity16 , a seasoned field biologist , said ' i 've seen some bizarre looking caterpillars in my time of working in the field but this was definitely the weirdest one i 've ever seen			0
' i was n't sure what i was looking at at first , it was this big yellow fuzzy thing			0
this is the equivalent of the ' @entity1 moth 's ' cocoon , however , the larva does not spin a cocoon in the conventional sense , instead the moth separates from its furry skin and uses it as a protective covering while it pupates after the southern flannel moth has finished pupating and left its cocoon , it looks more like a bee than @entity1 @entity1 is an @entity11 business magnate , tv personality and author			1
he was born june 14 , 1946 and is the chairman and president of @entity99			0
he has starred in the @entity11 version of @entity101 and came 14th on the 2012 @entity103 list			0
@entity1 is nicknamed ' @entity1 ' after his first wife @entity104 referred to him as such in a interview in 2008			1
in 2007 @entity1 appeared at @entity106 in @entity107 with @entity108 , who competed against @entity109 and @entity111 chairman @entity110			2
whoever lost would had to shave their head			0
luckily for the flannel moth @entity109 lost and @entity110 's head was shaved			2
' it 's actually a flannel moth caterpillar , they 're really rare , i 've seen this type of caterpillar before but never one of this colour			2
' we put the picture of our @entity127 and @entity128 page and immediately people started comparing it to @entity1			2
' we did n't see the resemblance when we first saw the caterpillar but looking at the photo it 's certainly similar to his hair			2
' it was pretty funny , people went mad for the photo comparing it to his toupee			0
' i think if @entity1 saw it himself , he 'd find a reason to come down and check the caterpillar out			2
' it 's not the most approachable of caterpillars either - if you touch that thing it would seriously hurt , it has these little hairs that can poke into your skin and release a venom			0
' when we show people the image some do n't even know what it is , some think it 's a mammal others a bird or some have said a plant			0
' but to us and most of the people who 've seen it , it 's @entity1 's toupee - left on a leaf in the @entity13			1

' @entity1 moth ' found in @entity13 rainforest
the moth 's hair , or spines , are venomous and can cause severe skin irritations
