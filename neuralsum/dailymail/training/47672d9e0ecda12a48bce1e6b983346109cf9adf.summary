cancer patients can cut their risk of dying by up to half - by walking just one mile a day , experts claim cancer patients can cut their risk of dying by up to half – simply by walking just one mile a day , according to experts			1
a study revealed physical activity as a ‘ wonder drug ’ , with those diagnosed with breast and prostate cancers able to cut their risk of death by up to 40 per cent			1
and for bowel cancer patients , doubling the walking distance was found to halve the risk of dying			1
the calculations are based on walking one mile at a moderate pace of 3mph , which would take just 20 minutes a day			1
the research by @entity19 , a network of walking groups run by @entity22 and the @entity23 , found physical activity can also reduce the impact of some debilitating side effects of cancer treatment , such as swelling around the arm , anxiety , depression , fatigue , impaired mobility and weight changes			1
the charity estimates that 1.6million of the two million people living with cancer in the @entity38 are not active at recommended levels			0

’ it is unclear how activity helps , but the effect goes further than simply weight control , which cuts down on the amount of cancer - promoting hormones produced by body fat			2
the latest thinking is exercise may break down oestrogen to produce ‘ good ’ metabolites that lower the risk of some cancers			0
the reduction in risk of death from cancer is based on research review evidence in @entity22 ’s @entity100 report			1
@entity40 ( pictured ) , ceo of @entity22 , said : ' today ’s research highlights the very simple reality – walking can save lives ' it says breast cancer patients cut the risk by 40 per cent if they do recommended levels of activity , compared with those doing less than an hour a week			1
the risk is reduced by 30 per cent for men with prostate cancer			0
bowel cancer sufferers who walk 18 miles a week – 2.5 miles or around 50 minutes a day – can cut their risk of dying by 50 per cent			1
walking for 150 minutes a week at 3mph results in total walking of 7.5 miles in a week – just over a mile , or 20 minutes a day			2

many of our walkers have long term conditions such as cancer themselves and find the companionship and fresh air a wonderful therapy			0
‘ we want to put walking at the centre of efforts to tackle physical inactivity and echo @entity161 ’s call for health professionals to prescribe walking to those who are recovering from cancer or other health conditions			1

patients can cut risk of dying by half by walking one mile a day , study finds
those with breast cancer can reduce risk by up to 40 *%* via physical activity
for bowel cancer patients , doubling walking distance ' halves risk of dying '
