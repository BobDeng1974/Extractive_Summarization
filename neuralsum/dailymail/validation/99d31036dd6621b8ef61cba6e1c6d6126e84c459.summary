a teenage boy has described the bizarre moment he was diagnosed with testicular cancer using a pregnancy test			1
@entity4 , from @entity5 , @entity6 , was given the test by doctors because the disease can cause the body to make the same hormone produced during pregnancy			1
after getting a positive result , the 19 - year - old was given the devastating news he had the disease and began seven months of treatment			1
now , after surgery and intensive chemotherapy , he is in remission - and has become an ambassador for @entity22			0
the disease can cause the body to produce the same hormone as produced during pregnancy after the ' positive ' result , the 19 - year - old began months of treatment at @entity32 , @entity33 mr @entity4 said : ' it was all very surreal to be honest			1
' there i was with a positive pregnancy test and something growing inside me			1
i thought i was going to end up in a documentary			0
' home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( @entity43 ) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta			1
experts say beta @entity43 can also signal testicular cancer			1
dr @entity49 , @entity50 at @entity51 , said : ' the pregnancy hormone ( @entity43 ) is often ( but not always ) produced by testicular tumours			1
' where it is produced , it can used for diagnostic and monitoring purposes			0
' in cases where the cancer has spread , the level of the @entity43 can be very high and if the clinical picture fits with a testicular cancer then a pregnancy test , which effectively is a test for @entity43 in the urine , can be used to make the diagnosis			1
' home pregnancy tests detect a hormone called beta human chorionic gonadotropin ( @entity43 ) found in the blood and the urine which is produced by the developing placenta			1
experts say beta @entity43 can also signal testicular cancer			1
@entity72 , @entity73 at the charity orchid , told @entity75 : @entity43 is one of three blood tests performed in all men with testicular cancer - it identifies how active and possibly widespread the cancer may be			1
' it can also be used to help monitor treatment and determine how well treatment is working and to identify men who may need more intensive treatment			0
' however he stressed there are two types of testicular cancer - and @entity89 is not present in the majority of cases of the most common form			1
and any man worried should not use a pregnancy test as a diagnostic tool			1
mr @entity72 added : ' to be picked up by a urine pregnancy test , the level of @entity43 has to be very high which will not be the case for many testicular cancers			1
' it is not and never has been a standard test ' @entity43 can also be raised in the presence of other things such as illegal performance enhancing drugs ( used by athletes etc. ) ' mr @entity4 claims his hospital experience was as bizarre as his diagnosis			1
' when i was about to go into surgery , i had to have an epidural like a pregnant woman - it was all very weird			0
' it 's really hard to describe how it felt - you do n't really come to terms with what 's going on , you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me			2
' i 'm relieved to be in remission , and now i want to help raise awareness			0
' cancer is no longer a death sentence , and i would like to spread that message			0
' mr @entity4 had just returned from a boy 's holiday in @entity130 last august , when a niggling pain in his side became too hard to ignore			1
after visiting his doctor , who could feel a mass in his abdomen , he was referred to his local hospital for an ultrasound			0
he said : ' before i went to @entity130 i 'd been getting this weird pain on and off , but i did n't think much of it			2
' i went to the gp about it , but because i was going to the gym it was just put down to muscle pain			0
' but when i was referred to the local hospital scans showed that i had a tumour that was spreading into my lungs			2
' i was told that it was cancer - but they were n't sure what type - and that i would probably need chemotherapy			1
' mr @entity4 was referred to the @entity22 unit in @entity33 , where doctors tried to determine what type of cancer he was suffering from			1
it was there that he was asked to provide a sample for a pregnancy test , to determine if the tumour was producing the hormones linked to both pregnancy , and testicular cancer			1
looking back , mr @entity4 said : ' it 's really hard to describe how it felt - you do n't really come to terms with what 's going on , you just go along with it - it took me a while to realise what was happening to me ' after getting a positive result from the pregnancy test , mr @entity4 was diagnosed with stage four testicular cancer - which had spread to his abdomen and lungs			1
the news came just a day before he received his a-level results			0
in 2012 , a man credited the popular social news site @entity180 with helping him catch his testicular cancer at an early stage			1
the patient , who was not identified , took the test left in his apartment by an ex-girlfriend as a joke - but was shocked to discover two pink lines indicating pregnancy			2
the incident was turned into a crudely drawn black - and - white comic strip by a friend , who put it up on @entity180 where it attracted more than 1,300 comments from concerned users			0
' if this is true , you should check yourself for testicular cancer			1
@entity201 it , ' one commenter wrote			0
the @entity180 user who put up the cartoon passed on the concerned comments to his friend on monday , the man made an appointment with a doctor who diagnosed him with cancer after detecting a small lump in his right testicle			0
he said : ' i gave the hospital a urine sample , the pregnancy test came back positive , and i started chemotherapy the day after i was diagnosed			1
' i would go in for five days in a row and have the chemo constantly			0
' it really took it out of me - my brain was muddled and i found it hard to concentrate on long films or books			0
' i suppose i did have some thoughts about death , but i did n't want to approach cancer in a negative way			2
' for me , the cancer diagnosis was a positive thing , because it meant that a plan could be put in place to get rid of it			2
' throughout my cycles of chemo the hospital would monitor the " pregnancy hormone " through blood tests			2
' the hormone had been really , really high , but it was gradually declining which was great news , and the tumours in my lungs and abdomen were shrinking			2
' in december , mr @entity4 had surgery to remove the growth in his abdomen ( and the surrounding lymph nodes ) and a testicle			2
in january , tests revealed he was cancer free			2
he said : ' it was a really strange feeling to be told i was ok again - you 're just sort of expected to go back to normal , but my mindset has completely changed			0
' before all this happened i thought my life was pretty much guaranteed until i was about 85			0
' but it gave me the realisation of my own mortality - i sort of had an early midlife crisis			0
' he now plans to attend university and says he ' just wants to enjoy life '			0
' i 'm doing stand up comedy about testicular cancer , as i think people need to be educated about it more			1
after chemotherapy , which caused him to lose his hair ( right ) , @entity4 is focusing his energy on living life to the full and raising money for the @entity22 ' i hated hearing people talk about cancer all the time , and i just thought this is a different way to approach it			2
' it 's something a bit different , and a way to show that cancer does n't always have to be a death sentence			2
' throughout his cancer journey , he was supported by @entity22			0
he said : ' the @entity22 ward was great , the ward is kitted out with a tv , pool tables and free @entity285			0
' everyone is going through the same thing so you get a lot of support			0
' i even had the opportunity to meet @entity292 and @entity293 when i was there			0
' it gave you an aspect of normality through everything that was going on			0

if caught at an early stage , men can expect a high cure rate with 98 per cent of sufferers disease - free a year after treatment			1
if caught at any stage , 96 per cent of men will still be alive 10 years after their treatment			0
unlike many cancers , there are few known risk factors for testicular cancer			1
men born with an undescended testicle , are at a slightly greater risk			0
around 10 per cent of sufferers will have a history of this condition			0
having a brother or father affected by testicular cancer can also increase a man 's risk			1
