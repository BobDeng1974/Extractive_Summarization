anyone who 's ever fancied making like the @entity1 can now live out their dream in a fully @entity5 themed hotel room ... even if only for three hours			1
the @entity6 in @entity7 has kitted out one of its suites with a @entity5 double bed , batcave style walls , a bat - tub and bat tvs and is finding the bat - themed room a real money spinner			1
other rooms in the movie - themed hotel are based on other popular films , with a room dedicated to @entity21 , another based on the famous @entity23 prison and a third building on the popularity of @entity26			1
budding batmen need only apply for a night in the bat bed ... complete with batphone nearby but it is the @entity5 room which has attracted the most interest , say the hotel 's owners			2
miniature gargoyle figurines that look as if they are from @entity36 are just one of the features of the suite , which can be rented for Â£ 40 for three hours			0
a batsafe , bat mirror ... and @entity5 poster complete the look			0
holy hoteliers : even the @entity45 makes an appearance as a seat in front of the bat mirror a large flat screen ' @entity50 ' also acts as a screen for the floodlit bathtub behind bat curios include a bat mirror , poster , ' batsafe ' for valuables and various knick knacks for fans there are a few other rooms also available by the hour - or three hours - for lovers who want a discreet rendezvous			0
a ' @entity64 ' room , a ' @entity66 ' suite and a ' love suite ' covered in hearts are also attracting couples who like the idea of checking into a themed hotel			2
@entity5 fans commenting on the hotel 's website have pointed out that there are several different @entity5 styles in the room , one of which was used by @entity80 , while another is closer to @entity82 's @entity5 in @entity83			0
@entity85 splendour : the mummy - themed room is for fans of the adventure movie starring @entity89 no escape : the @entity23 room takes the famous prison as its theme , and comes complete with handcuffs simply capital : it 's not immediately clear why the @entity98 - themed room in the @entity7 hotel is so called ... something fishy : comic book creation aquaman also has a room designed in his honour the ' @entity107 style ' room has a bathroom with a nod to classicism , as this ' @entity107 ' statue shows the @entity6 motel in @entity7 has a slew of movie - themed rooms , despite its unprepossessing outer appearance			1
