this poignant footage from space shows smoke rising from @entity3 's @entity2 , moments after two planes smashed into them in the terror attack which killed thousands of people			1
the haunting photos and video , shown in full for the first time today on @entity11 , were shot by @entity13 astronaut @entity12 as he looked down helplessly on @entity3 on september 11 , 2001			1
he said his first instinct was to grab a camera - and hours later he would discover a close friend , a pilot at the controls of one of the hijacked planes , was one of the dead			2
emotional : the footage , to be aired on @entity22 , was taken from space by @entity13 astronaut @entity12 as he orbited helplessly above @entity3			1
he later learned a good friend was one of the pilots killed in the attack far - reaching : a plume of smoke can be seen streaming from the @entity2 on 9/11 in this image taken by astronaut @entity12 , who was in space ground level : this was the scene on the ground as @entity3 's emergency services battled fearlessly to save the thousands of people still trapped inside the images emerged as part of research for a television series about astronauts and will be shown for the first time in the @entity45 as part of @entity22 's @entity48 season			1
@entity12 made the recording as the huge plume of smoke from the towers drifted across the city , only learning a few hours afterwards that his friend , @entity54 , had been one of the pilots killed that day when his plane was flown into the @entity57			1
he responded by playing the @entity59 bugle call - which signals the end of the day for @entity13 military personnel - on a trumpet in a poignant tribute to his friend			1
in a public message to his countrymen , he wrote the following day : ‘ it 's horrible to see smoke pouring from wounds in your own country from such a fantastic vantage point			2
‘ the dichotomy of being on a spacecraft dedicated to improving life on the @entity77 and watching life being destroyed by such wilful , terrible acts is jolting to the psyche , no matter who you are			0
’ tribute : @entity84 plays taps on his bugle on september 16 , 2001 , to honor his friend @entity54 who was killed in the attacks historic : astronaut @entity12 filmed the aftermath of the terror attack in @entity3 while in space @entity12 explained that upon learning of the attacks he rushed around the station until he found a window that would give him a view of @entity3 and grabbed the nearest camera			1
he said : ‘ it 's difficult to describe how it feels to be the only @entity13 completely off the planet at a time such as this			1
the feeling that i should be there with all of you , dealing with this , helping in some way , is overwhelming			0
’ the channel ’s @entity48 season next week will feature documentaries about astronauts , building up to a two - and - a - half - hour live broadcast from the @entity112 and @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity115 , which will feature a full 90 - minute orbit of @entity77			0
victim : pilot @entity118 was killed in the 9/11 attack at the @entity57 short clips from the film of the attacks on @entity3 were released by @entity123 to mark the tenth anniversary in 2011 , but the film has not been seen in full with @entity12 ’s commentary and bugle call			1
creative director of the @entity22 project , @entity130 , said : ' not every frame has been seen before , so every frame that was shot on that day is in the show			2
' executive producer @entity134 said : ' it ’s the first time we have had it in that form with @entity12 talking us through it			2
' if that had been in a movie you ’d have gone , " oh come on , that guy ’s got a trumpet ? "			0
but reality is stranger than fiction sometimes			0
' it will feature in the documentary astronauts : @entity114 we have a problem for which program - makers have been given access to @entity123 footage of some of the difficulties in space over the years			2
they include film of @entity160 astronaut @entity159 , who was close to drowning when his helmet filled with water during a space walk , causing colleagues to fear for his life			2
during other filming for the documentary - to be screened on march 13 - there was a real - life emergency on the station when a cooling system failed , forcing the crew to make two space walks to fix it			0
during the show , @entity13 astronaut @entity12 , recalled how he saw smoke rising from @entity3 's @entity2 while onboard the @entity112 in 2001			1
this image from the @entity180 satellite shows smoke still rising at 11.30am on september 12 space view : an image from a @entity123 satellite also captured the plume of smoke coming from the @entity2 @entity134 said : ' suddenly a valve went on a coolant pump outside and they had to shut down power to half the station to power down a lot of equipment , so we were there filming our general stuff and they let us in on meetings of all these various teams			1
' they work out how will they do the space walk , people are practicing in the big pool with a model of the space station underwater because it ’s very like microgravity			0
' it was just an amazing coincidence that we happened to be filming - no space walks were filmed for @entity209 [ @entity208 ] , @entity210 [ @entity211 ] and @entity214 ’s [ @entity213 ] mission			0
it was incredible to see the teamwork that went on to work out what needed to be done and how they would do it			0
the live program , @entity221 : @entity222 , will be screened on march 16 , and presented by @entity223 and veteran astronaut @entity224 , who helped fix the @entity226 telescope			0
the @entity227 airs on @entity22 from wednesday march 12 at 9pm			0
