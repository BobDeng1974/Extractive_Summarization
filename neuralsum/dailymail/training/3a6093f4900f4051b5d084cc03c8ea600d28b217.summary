we ignored the first one and there was a second one , suddenly			0
the windows were smashed and stools were thrown into the pub. we ran back to hide			2
' we were stuck in the back of the pub for about half an hour			0

' @entity302 's @entity42 the @entity28 on @entity303 on the cobbled streets of @entity13 's old town had its dark red shutters closed when we arrived at around midnight local time			1
we had already met groups of @entity2 fans in the street ; many just groups of ordinary young lads who had driven through the night to follow their team			1
they were shocked but many were starting to feel angry , too ; angry that their club had been targeted again			0
all were critical of the response of the @entity6 police			2
the @entity22 is a narrow pub with reinforced glass windows at the front , wooden floors and benches , a crowded bar to your right and a slightly narrower back room			2
this is what had scared the @entity12 and @entity329 who drink their regularly : there is only one way out and that is through the front door , which is where the gang attacked			2
@entity2 fans had been trapped inside			2
the landlord @entity336 , who has run the pub since 1995 but is originally from @entity145 in @entity146 , was trying to make sense of it all			0
there had been a quick and concerted clean up operation by the time we arrived , with the @entity280 community in @entity13 quick to help a friend in need , but everyone looked visibly shocked - particularly a girl who had been working behind the bar			2
the glass and bits of broken bar stools had been swept away and the floors had been cleaned of the drops of blood and beer that had been spilled in the panic			0
but the collection of items that had been hurled into the pub - including a flare - by the gang in two waves of attacks was chilling			2
there were cast - iron table legs and the kind of large circular weight used to secure a patio umbrella			0
one man said how a @entity2 fan had rushed behind the bar into a back office when the attack happened , urging the bar staff to barricade themselves inside			2
' i was in @entity211 and i 've got a two - year - old baby , ' he said			2
' this ca n't keep happening			0
' there was certainly that sense of disbelief			0
the pub staff expressed it in the way they described the gang of hooded men doing @entity8 salutes on their front door and the @entity2 fans had the same tone as they discussed the events of @entity211			1
both agreed on another thing , too			0
this attack had nothing to do with football			0
brutal : ten supporters were hurt and one seriously injured in the @entity211 attack , while two @entity399 fans were charged with attempted murder in the last decade @entity12 football fans have been the subject of a series of knife attacks when going to support their team at games in @entity211 the attack on the @entity2 fans is the latest in a long series assaults on suspected @entity181 in @entity13 , which has a long history of @entity411			1
last year a gang of 10 youths attacked three @entity181 men with hammers and metal bars			2
it led to jewish community leader @entity418 saying : ' not a week passes without anti-semitic assaults in @entity6			0
i refuse to believe @entity181 will be forced to choose between security and their @entity181 identity			0
' @entity423 , chief rabbi of the @entity424 in @entity13 , called the atmosphere ' unbearable			0
; ' these incidents are becoming more and more frequent , so much so , alas , as to make one take them for granted , ' he said			0
@entity13 's dark history of @entity411 extends back centuries , and includes @entity431 , the so - called ' @entity431 ' - a @entity8 who tortured and murdered hundreds of @entity181 with the help of @entity6 collaborators during @entity435			1
