for 20 years he has sung out plaintively in search of a friend , without getting any reply			1
now an expedition is being planned to find and study the world ’s loneliest whale , who is simply known as 52			1
despite listening to the animal 's abnormally high song of 52 hertz for over 20 years , researchers have never seen what it looks like			1
the creature has been calling out at a frequency not used by any other whales in the @entity22 for the last 20 years			1
a stock image of a fin whale is shown the unknown male whale is called ' lonely ' because he appears to communicate at a frequency not used by any other whale in the @entity22 , and so far , it is not thought to have ever got a response to his songs			1
possible partners may not be able to hear him , or his song may be so different from their own that they ca n’t understand it , but this has not stopped 52 singing into oblivion			2
experts believe the huge mammal is most likely a fin whale , but he could be a blue whale , or a hybrid of the two species			2
in order to learn more about the whale , @entity45 , a 40 - year - old film maker based in @entity47 , has launched a @entity49 campaign to find and tag the 52 hertz whale			1
together with entourage star , @entity52 and a team of marine biologists , he aims to raise $ 300,000			1
so far the campaign has pulled in $ 57,465 and backers can receive everything from a 52 ringtone and mix tape inspired by the whale , to signed books , tickets to the film premiere and even a lesson to swim like a mermaid			2
‘ we will be mounting a 20 day expedition that will take us 400 miles off the @entity68 coast out into the open ocean , ’ according to the @entity49 page			2
‘ using state of the art technology , our goal is to be the first expedition ever to tag and acoustically monitor a hybrid whale using non-invasive tags			2
‘ at the same time , we will also be collecting data in an effort to help scientists measure the growing threat of ocean noise pollution that is harming cetaceans all across the planet including whales ’ he will also make a documentary about the trip , which is planned to take place in the autumn			0
the @entity90 began passing recordings of whale song to scientists in the late 1980s , @entity89 reported			2
it picked up the haunting noises when trying to listen for submarines in the @entity22			0
in 1989 , dr @entity97 of the @entity98 began to sort through the recordings and noticed that one whale 's song was much higher in pitch than the others			1
most male fin and blue whales sing at around 17 to 18 hertz , which is too deep for humans to hear , but the ' lonely ' whale communicates at 52 hertz			1
when more recordings were released in the nineties , dr @entity97 studied the 52 hertz whale more closely			1
dr @entity97 ' team was able to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season , when whales are at their most vocal and published a paper on his findings in 2004			0
in order to learn more about the whale , @entity45 ( pictured left ) , a 40 - year - old film maker based in @entity47 , has launched a @entity49 campaign to find and tag the 52 hertz whale			1
it is supported by @entity126 star , @entity52 ( right ) and a team of marine biologists scientists have been listening to the whale for two decades but no - one has seen it , so they are not sure exactly what species they are looking for			1
experts believe the huge mammal is is most likely that it is a fin whale ( pictured ) but could be a hybrid of a blue and a fin whale the immediate goal is to raise a minimum of $ 300,000 ( £ 194,851 ) to cover the costs of a scientific trip			2
a 20 day expedition will travel 400 miles ( 644km ) off the @entity68 coast into the open ocean			0
it 's planned for autumn			0
marine biologists hope to tag and monitor the sounds of a hybrid whale			1
52 is thought to be a hybrid of a fin whale and blue whale			2
they will also collect data to help scientists shed light on whether ocean noise pollution is harming cetaceans , including whales			0
this is when the whale ’s love - lorn predicament first captured the world ’s attention and the 52 hertz animal was dubbed ' the loneliest whale in the world '			1
as dr @entity97 sadly died from cancer before his research captured the imagination of the public , his research assistant @entity168 has carried on his scientific legacy			0
she said that the team has never seen the whale they have been studying and do not know what species it is			0
they do not know if it is medically unusual but she said it is obviously healthy as it has been living for at least two decades			0
however , when it came to musing about the creature 's loneliness , ms @entity168 said : ' is he alone ? i do n’t know			0
' people like to imagine this creature out there swimming by his lonesome , just singing away and nobody ’s listening			0
but i ca n’t say that			0
' in a recent interview with @entity196 , @entity194 floated the idea that the whale may enjoy being solitary and used it to comment on her love life			0
she said ‘ … everybody feels so sorry for this whale – but what if this whale is having a great time ? ’ mr @entity45 decribed the whale as inspirational in an interview with @entity207 , and said that he wants to find the whale for all the people who think about it			1
‘ it 's not just about jumping in front of him and saying , “ hey , we 're here ! ” and giving him a hug when he does n't want one			0
it 's more about what it means for us			0
’ ‘ for some people , he 's so lonely and for others he ’s celebrating his alone - ness			0
' most male blue and fin whales ( pictured ) sing at around 17 to 18 hertz , which is too deep for humans to hear , but the ' lonely ' whale communicates at 52 hertz			1
dr @entity97 ' team has used its song to triangulate its movements and track its location across the ocean during mating season			0

marine biologists will attempt to find the ' loneliest whale in the world '
expedition will be *transformed* into a documentary by @entity45
experts have been listening to the animal 's 52 hertz song for 20 years
it 's thought he communicates at a frequency not used by any other whale
