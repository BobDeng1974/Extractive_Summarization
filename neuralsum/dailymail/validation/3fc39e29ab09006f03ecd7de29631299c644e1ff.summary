as same sex relationships become more acceptable , the more visible they are and the more we can learn about them			1
or should i say learn from them , since most of the research that is emerging about gay relationships suggests they can teach us straights more than a thing or two ! it ’s not easy being gay and being different to the norm			1
but turns out there ’s a huge pay off for having to fight for the right to love who you want without judgement			1
gay relationships appear to work better than straight relationships in lots of key ways			1
gay relationships work better than straight relationships in lots of key ways , says @entity24 here ’s what we can learn from same sex couples : 1			1
they ’re not hung up on male or female stereotypes of who should do what in a relationship			2
couples in same sex relationships do n’t just slot into what ’s expected			1
they divide up the chores and roles in their relationship on who is best at them , rather than ‘ that ’s the man ’s job ’ or ‘ woman ’s job ’			0
the result is they work better as a team - and there ’s less resentment over silly , sexist things like secretly thinking ‘ he should be earning more than me ’ or ‘ she should be the one emptying the dishwasher ’			0
they fight fair @entity59 relationships guru @entity58 , one of the world ’s foremost experts on relationships , says same sex couples are far kinder and nicer to each other during arguments than straights are			1
they do n’t personally attack each other , they ’re more positive , less domineering and belligerent			0
same sex couples also laugh more during a row - which is the best way to remind you both that you actually like each other , even if you do n’t like what one of you did or did n’t do ! @entity58 found gay men and women were also more affectionate , listened more and were less defensive in arguments			1
the sexpert says it ’s not easy being gay and being different to the norm , but that there ’s a huge pay off for having to fight for the right to love who you want without judgement why are they so much better at it than heterosexuals ? one reason is that power is equal			1
there ’s less bullying and less blaming of problems on gender because you do n’t have set expectations of each other ’s roles			0
in society , women are expected to be the pacifiers and men the ‘ fixers ’			0
but sometimes it ’s women who are good at coming up with practical solutions and men who are good at soothing			0
same sex couples tend to let whoever is best at something take over			2
they ’re more experimental sexually male / female sex falls into a set pattern from a very early age			0
usually , the guy initiates , there ’s foreplay ( generally more for her than him ) and intercourse is very much the main event			0
@entity123 , on the other hand , are much less penetration orientated and orgasm orientated : they just do whatever they feel like in that particular sex session			0
gay men are far more experimental with different types of sex rather than sticking rigidly to the ‘ vanilla ’ , basic type of sex straight people in long - term relationships tend to have			1
they ’re happy to show and tell lots of straight women are often too embarrassed to let their partner watch them masturbate			0
gay men love showing off - and watching other guys turn themselves on			1
they also watch carefully to see what technique they use , so they can copy it later			0
lesbians often have mutual masturbation sessions and consequently know a lot more about what techniques their partner likes than the average straight couple			0
they do n’t have to deal with the in - laws meeting each other ’s parents and seeing them regularly as a couple is pretty much standard for most straight couples			2
but not all gays are at the same point in the coming - out process and not all families are tolerant and open to gay relationships			1
this means less forced visits with relatives you might not necessarily get on with - which means less rows about the in - laws			0
they do n’t get hung up on porn partners watching porn is often frowned upon and seen as threatening by women in straight relationships			2
gay men understand that men simply like looking at sexy things and same sex couples generally are more tolerant of each other ’s differences			2
