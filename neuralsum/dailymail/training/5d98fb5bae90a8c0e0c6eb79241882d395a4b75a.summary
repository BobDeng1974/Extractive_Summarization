the locals swear it is the good sea air that keeps them healthy			2
but whatever the reason , the picturesque town of @entity3 in @entity4 is today named as the pensioner capital of @entity7			1
nearly one in three of those living in the coastal town is retired , double the national average			1
the town of 47,750 has nearly 14,200 pensioners – 29.7 per cent – a report published today shows			1
suits you : picturesque @entity3 is home to 14,200 pensioners scenic : @entity3 has the highest percentage of pensioners of any town in @entity7 and , according to separate data from the @entity24 , this figure will rise to nearly 37.9 per cent by 2031			1
residents say the town , with its mild climate , 11th century castle and large natural harbour , is driven by an army of active over- 65s who keep a vibrant cultural community running			1
the report , compiled by the @entity34 and based on analysis of 2011 census figures , show @entity37 in @entity38 has the lowest @entity39 of retirees in the @entity7 , with just one in 16 ( 6 per cent )			1
the @entity42 , with its beaches and countryside , was found to be the most popular region for retirees generally , with a fifth of the population of pension age			1
other areas listed as grey hotspots include @entity52 , in second place , @entity54 in third , and @entity55 in @entity56 in fourth			0

only around one in nine ( 11 per cent ) of those living in the capital are pensioners			2
@entity62 , retirement expert at @entity34 , said : ‘ perhaps unsurprisingly , there ’s a tendency for people to move out to the country when they stop working , where property prices can be lower and the quality of life is often thought to be higher			0
‘ however , people planning to stop working should n’t assume that a move to the country is the simple answer to a comfortable retirement , as the cost of living in these hot spots can be surprisingly high			0
’ almost half of homes currently listed for sale in @entity3 have a price tag of at least £ 300,000			0
last year , a beach hut in the area sold for £ 170,000 two days after going on the market			0
overall , over 65s now make up nearly a sixth of the @entity7 population			0
there are 900,000 more over 65s than there were a decade ago , highlighting just how big the challenge @entity7 faces in caring for our elderly			0
an estimated 16.4 per cent of the population , or 9,223,000 people , are over 65 as the post-war baby boomers reach their twilight years and life expectancy continues to rise			2
despite concerns over the rising cost of care , research suggests pensioners are richer than at any time in the past 15 years			2
the @entity102 found last year that pensioner incomes have risen by 29.4 per cent since 1999 compared with just 26 per cent for working people .			0
