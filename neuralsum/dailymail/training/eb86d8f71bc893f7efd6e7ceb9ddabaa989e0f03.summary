@entity6 and her partner @entity7 who with the help of @entity6 's sister @entity19 are planning a £ 10 wedding the couple thought they would have to save for years to wed and the idea of getting married on a shoe string budget started as a joke ( @entity27 ) @entity26 , wedding planner @entity28 , @entity6 , and @entity29 , who are delighted with the donations received so far for the wedding - including the wedding dress ! but little did they know a flippant comment from @entity29 , @entity6 ’s sister , would change their plans quite so dramatically			1
@entity6 said : ' we were just sitting round the table and i said to @entity26 ‘ do you want to marry me ’ ? and she said ‘ what , with £ 10 ’ ? ' then @entity19 says she ’d bet she could do it with a tenner so i told her ‘ go on then ’			1
' that was only four days ago and @entity19 , of @entity45 , @entity14 , has already managed to secure a wedding dress , bridesmaids dresses , a reception venue , caterer , @entity50 , cake , a wedding planner and many more aspects of a wedding that usually take months to source			1
@entity19 says : ' i thought i would try putting something on @entity56 to see if anyone had any ideas and it just went from there ' the 38 - year - old never expected the task , which she has dubbed ‘ the £ 10 @entity63 ’ , to take off so quickly			1
she said : ' at first i thought there was no way i was going to do this but i thought i would try putting something on @entity56 to see if anyone had any ideas and it just went from there			0
