' @entity0 ' hopped up the corridor of his palatial enclosure , clambered over a rock and went straight for a bowl writhing with his favourite meal of maggots , live worms , fly eggs and chopped fruit , drizzled with sunflower oil			1
' he 's a good man , his lordship ' said senior australian fauna keeper at @entity18 ’s @entity17 , @entity13 , ' i 'm very proud of him , although he is being a bit of a pig , ' @entity13 said as ' @entity0 ' , a mature male @entity22 bilby , hoed into the worms			1
@entity13 , who is originally from @entity24 , @entity25 , and trained at @entity26 , is preparing the bilby , an endangered @entity22 marsupial , for the forthcoming visit to the @entity18 harbourside zoo by the @entity31 and @entity32			1
' @entity0 ' , an endangered @entity22 bilby who has been ' adopted ' by royal heir @entity0 hoes into a favourite meal of maggots			1
live worms and fly eggs in the bilby enclosure at @entity18 's @entity17 , which has been named after the young prince , with @entity43 approval @entity13 , inside the nocturnal animal enclosure with ' @entity0 ' , the bilby ' adopted ' by the @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity47 's eight - month - old son , has created a special setting of sand and rocks to emulate the desert environment in which the threatened species is found in the wild the @entity43 has accepted @entity55 's offer to name the bilby enclosure after @entity0 , and the @entity22 government 's gift of a bilby for the young prince to ' adopt '			1
@entity17 , which is ' incredibly proud to be part of @entity55 's gift to @entity0 ' sees the royal visit as ' a wonderful opportunity to raise awareness about @entity55 ’s unique native animals , especially the bilby which is threatened in the wild '			1
inside the nocturnal house at @entity17 , where mr @entity13 also works with possums , bats , gliders , rodents , owls and lizards , ' @entity0 ' is part of the zoo 's breeding programme to increase bilby populations , which launched last year with an @entity22 government donation after the royal heir 's birth in july			1
' we tried everything with three other male bilbies , but they were too old , one of them had a bit of a limp , ' said mr @entity13 , who came to @entity55 in 1981 after working as a keeper at @entity26 and @entity90			1
' then we got his lordship here , ' he pointed at ' @entity0 ' , ' although there was a problem at the start			2
' will prince @entity95 take @entity0 ( pictured at the little prince 's christening last october ) to @entity18 's @entity17 , where an enclosure has been named after the royal heir who has ' adopted ' an endangered marsupial bilby as a gift from the @entity22 government @entity18 's famous @entity17 says it is ' incredibly proud to be part of @entity55 's gift to @entity0 ' and sees the royal visit by the @entity31 and @entity32 of @entity106 next month as ' a wonderful opportunity to raise awareness about @entity55 's unique native animals , especially the bilby which is threatened in the wild ' ccc @entity0 , the @entity22 bilby who has been ' adopted ' by young royal heir @entity0 has been introduced to a young female bilby on @entity17 's breeding programme , but has ' been quite the gentleman to date ' says his keeper , @entity13 endangered @entity22 marsupial , ' @entity0 ' inside @entity18 's @entity17 nocturnal enclosure sniffs at the hand of his keeper , @entity25 born @entity13 , who says he has high hopes of the animal producing bilbies in the future , following next month 's visit by the @entity31 and @entity32 and their son , @entity0 the royal couple will engage in the feeding displays of tree kangaroos ( left ) and the giraffes ( right ) on their visit to @entity17 next month , on @entity131 @entity133 , a male orang - utan , drinks peppermint tea at @entity17 which he and his partner , @entity135 , are served with hot meals as the weather cools down towards winter ' last year we put him with a female called @entity140 and we tried everything , but they did n't reproduce , so we asked for a young female			1
' her name 's @entity146 , it means friend [ in an @entity149 language ]			2
that 's why he keeps on taking off			0
she might be coming into season			0
' he 's sniffing at her door , although i must say ' @entity0 ' has been quite the gentleman to date			2
' as the bilby scampered away down the corridor to linger outside the darkened enclosure where the new young female bilby is ' settling in ' to life at @entity17 , mr @entity13 explained why he had become so passionate since emigrating to @entity55 about a native animal most @entity22 had never seen			1
mr @entity13 , who lives in @entity18 with his @entity165 - born wife , @entity166 , and their 13 - year - old son , who is also mad about bilbies , said he had started working at @entity17 a year after arriving in @entity55			1
set against the spectacular backdrop of @entity18 harbour with its bridge @entity17 is home to 4,000 animals of 350 species , including this @entity175 ( above ) the display by the @entity177 at @entity17 ( above ) will be part of the zoo tour undertaken by the royal couple ' i got my first job working on a horse stud in @entity185 and when i showed them my diploma of zoo keeping from @entity190 , they just said ' put that away you @entity192 bastard , we do n't need to see it ' and so i just worked with the horses on the farm and it was great			1
' i started at @entity17 and then in the nocturnal house and i just got to love bilbies			2
they are the most amazing little animals			0
' see those ears ? they 're like sophisticated air conditioning systems to help them survive in the desert , where it 's hot during the day and freezing at night			0
' when it ’s hot , the bilbies keep their ears erect			0
the ears are hairless and rapidly cool the little creatures			0
when it ’s cold , they let their ears fall against their head , almost like a little helmet , to conserve heat			0
' we ’ve also found they can run very quickly and when they do , the hold their white - tipped tails forwards over their heads , like a little lamp lighting their way			0
' we ’re getting amazing reactions from people			0
' ordinary @entity22 will be allowed in to @entity17 ( above ) on @entity131 , when the royal couple - and , perhaps @entity0 - visit the bilby , enlcosure and see tree kangaroos , giraffes and birds of prey once he learned how fast the bilbies can move , mr @entity13 set up what he jokingly calls ' the running of the bilbies ' , a display for visitors in which bilbies like ' @entity0 ' run up the corridor to a special setting of fake rocks , sand and tree stumps he has assembled between walls painted in @entity149 colours and with the different tribal names for the creature			1
' @entity248 once thrived across 70 per cent of @entity55 , ' he said			0
' these days most bilby populations are on @entity149 land in the deserts of the @entity252 and @entity55			0
' elsewhere they 've had to compete with rabbits , feral cats and populations have declined , so we have high hopes for his lordship and our breeding programme			0
' it is not confirmed whether young @entity0 will accompany his parents to @entity17 on @entity131 , when the @entity31 and @entity32 will start at the bilby enclosure , move on to feeding sessions in the tree kangaroo and giraffe enclosures , and then watch the birds of prey and other animals			1
' i like the challenge of a close encounter as with animals , ' mr @entity13 said , ' if you get people close to an animal , you can make them aware about conservation and that is very important with our bilbies			2
' mr @entity13 , who still has family back in @entity281 , says he is very happy he moved to sunny @entity55 but he now spends so much time in the nocturnal enclosure he has to take @entity285 tablets to regulate his system			2
' but i love my work , ' he said , ' and i love getting people excited about wildlife			0
' taronga director , @entity290 said the zoo was part of ' a national breeding program across a number of @entity22 zoos and wildlife organisations that are involved in conservation , breeding and research to provide an insurance population to safeguard ' bilbies into the future			2
' we look forward to introducing their @entity304 to our bilbies in april , ' he said .			0
