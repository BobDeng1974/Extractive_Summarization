a killer newt the size of a small car which roamed lakes and rivers in the time of the dinosaurs has been discovered in @entity7			1
described as ' like something out of a bad monster movie ' , the @entity8 once took the place of crocodiles as one of the @entity15 's top predators when they lived more than 200 million years ago			1
a distant relative to today 's salamander , the fossilised remains were found during a dig at an ancient lake in southern @entity7 which may have been home to hundreds of the creatures			1
' it was as long as a small car and had hundreds of sharp teeth in its big flat head , which kind of looks like a toilet seat when the jaws snap shut			2
it was the type of fierce predator that the very first dinosaurs had to put up with if they strayed too close to the water , long before the glory days of @entity52 and @entity53			0
' the family of giant salamander - like amphibians to which @entity35 belonged included other species found in parts of modern - day @entity60 , @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64			2
all were wiped out during a mass extinction 201 million years ago , long before the death of the dinosaurs			1
a distant relative to today 's salamander or newt ( pictured ) the fossilised remains were found during a dig at an ancient lake in southern @entity7 which may have been home to hundreds of the creatures described as ' like something out of a bad monster movie ' , the @entity8 were the same size as a small car , such as this @entity79 500 this event marked the end of the @entity82 , when the super landmass of @entity84 , which included all the world 's present - day continents , began to break apart			1

members of the @entity95 @entity35 colony are thought to have died when the lake they inhabited dried up			0
only a four square metre fraction of the site has been excavated so far , and work is continuing in the hope of unearthing more fossils			0
