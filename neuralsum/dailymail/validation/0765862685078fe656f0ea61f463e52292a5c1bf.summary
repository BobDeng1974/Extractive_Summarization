@entity0 has urged @entity1 to ' keep believing ' when they tackle @entity4 title contenders @entity5 on saturday without their captain and world - class number eight @entity8			1

@entity14 hooker @entity0 will take the armband at @entity16 in his absence , with @entity1 looking for a victory that would shred this season 's @entity4 form - book			1
@entity1 hooker @entity0 insists @entity1 have to keep faith in their abilities when they face @entity5 the @entity26 will be without their talismanic captain @entity8 for their final game of the tournament ' @entity8 is one of the best number eights in the world , ' @entity0 said at a press conference in @entity33 on friday			1
' of course he 's a big loss for us , but at the same time , it 's an opportunity for others to take responsibility			0
' @entity8 could play in every national team in the world , but we have to keep believing			1
' there will be moments of pressure , but we must keep our mentality for every second of the game			2
we can still play a good game without @entity8			2
' @entity1 have scored just three points in their two @entity4 home games this season , while they were thumped 52 - 11 by @entity51 at the @entity16 in their final match of the tournament last term			2
@entity8 limps off against @entity11 and has been ruled out of the game against @entity5 in @entity33 with @entity8 missing , @entity0 will captain @entity1 , and has called on his team to show their true ability and while they can reflect on beating @entity60 at @entity61 this time around , the campaign has proved to be another mixed bag of results			1

' our win in @entity60 came after two bad defeats , and we have shown that we are capable of overcoming negative moments			0
