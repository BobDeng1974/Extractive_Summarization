a diy store employee 's @entity1 lights use so much electricity he 's afraid to put the kettle on			1
hobbyist @entity5 and his family are facing an extra £ 500 on their bills this year - but say it 's all worth it to raise money for the local air ambulance			1
dozens of neighbours gathered in @entity15 , @entity16 , for the big switch - on at the two - bed semi-detached home where the 26 - year - old lives with his parents @entity21 and @entity23			1
mr @entity5 , who trained as an electrician and works in the electrical department at @entity43 , said : ' the lights are sequenced in time with the music with special software and it 's all controlled via two control panels			0
' we do n't boil the kettle or put the cooker on while we 've got the lights on because it 's an old house and an old supply , and we do n't like putting too much power on it			2
' so we boil the kettle , pour it in a flask and have a flask of hot water while the lights are on			0
' the display , in its 12th year , takes seven weeks to assemble and costs a fortune - including £ 150 for a control panel , £ 150 for software and another £ 600 for a control board shipped in from the @entity68 electrician : mr @entity5 , 26 , making the finishing touches to his glowing teddies			1
he has spent thousands on the displays , including £ 600 for a control board which had to be ordered from across the @entity74 mr @entity5 said : ' we do n't boil the kettle or put the cooker on while we 've got the lights on because it 's an old house and we do n't like putting too much power on it			1
so we boil the kettle and pour it in a flask ' in many previous years it cost more than it raised , making an average of around £ 300 a year			2
but last year the donations rocketed to around £ 850 , and mr @entity5 said he had high hopes for this year 's event			1
' we get more and more visitors as the word gets round and it 's becoming more popular , ' he said			0
mr @entity5 's mother helped switch on the lights this week dressed as @entity34 in a sleigh pulled by two shire horses			2
it took six and a half hours to program just one song , @entity100 's @entity99 , to play in time with the lights			0
even if it 's raining onlookers can still watch the display from their car , as it 's being broadcast on @entity106			0
ordinary home - extraordinary lights : the family house even broadcasts the soundtrack on @entity106 then and now : mr @entity5 ( right ) was inspired as a toddler by the @entity112 ( left ) there is also a pixel matrix screen which mr @entity5 built , a ' reindeer - cam ' which beams the scene into the @entity118 ' front room and seven other cameras			1
mr @entity5 was a toddler when he became obsessed with @entity1 lights after seeing the @entity112			2
it sparked a life - long hobby - and some of his display even includes lights once used in the seaside town			0
' i 've always wanted to get a job working on the @entity112 but i think they only employ people who live nearby , so i decided to make my own ' , he said			0
' it 's a nice thing to put a hobby into making people smile , making people happy and raising money for charity at the same time			1
' it 's a win - win , everyone benefits really ' .			0
