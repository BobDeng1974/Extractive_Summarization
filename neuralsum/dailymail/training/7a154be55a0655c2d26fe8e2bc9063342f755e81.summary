by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 17:00 est , 16 march 2013 unless you work for a foreign diplomatic service or you find yourself in a similar predicament to @entity6 founder @entity5 , it is unlikely you will ever spend a night at one of @entity9 ’s 115 embassies			1
but these foreign missions occupy some of the finest residences in the capital			2
a number are likely to move in the coming years , according to @entity14 of @entity16 magazine , and many of the addresses they occupy will come under private ownership as a result			2
‘ the majority of @entity9 ’s embassies are leased from the @entity24 ’s @entity23 , ’ says ms @entity14			1
fit for a diplomat : the former @entity26 in @entity9 has been transformed into a three - bedroom family home and is now on the market for £ 3.5m ‘ many of these long leases and peppercorn rents were agreed 100 to 120 years ago , and a number of these leases are expiring in coming years			1
foreign missions in @entity9 may change locations for this reason			1
’ one person ahead of the trend is designer @entity39 , who bought the former @entity41 embassy in @entity42 , @entity9 , for £ 1.95 million in 2008 and has now put it on the market for £ 3.5 million			1
in the @entity44 , the embassy moved			1
a lawyer bought the house and lived there until 2008 but did little in terms of renovation			2
now @entity39 has transformed the three - bedroom , @entity50 listed house , built in 1826 , into a sleek , modern living space which bears little resemblance to its old life as an embassy			1
@entity58 's reception room : @entity39 has transformed the embassy into a sleek , modern home no time for politics : one of the bedrooms in the @entity50 listed property welcoming light : the conversion took 13 months and saw the kitchen moved into the basement of the house ‘ it was in a sad state when i bought it , ’ says @entity39 , 41			1
‘ the skirting boards were in bad condition and the plasterwork had lost its sharpness			2
’ @entity39 , who was born in @entity76 and moved to @entity77 in 1992 , lived in the house for two years before beginning the work			0
‘ i wanted to understand it before i started			0
as a designer , i ’ve found living in a property makes the product better , ’ he says			0
‘ i wanted to know where the sun rose and set and how i could open it up to bring in light			0
the house has an exact east - west axis running through the length of it and this is what i wanted to exploit			0
‘ besides location , light and space are the holy grail of @entity97 property and it was vital for me to get these aspects right			0
’ new lease : @entity39 and wife @entity101 are selling their ' embassy ' @entity104 began in 2011 and took 13 months to complete			2
the addition of a skylight and a glass wall overlooking the garden , running from the ground floor down to the basement kitchen , made the most dramatic change			0
this has transformed a traditional four - storey cellular structure into an open - plan living space , with light flooding in all over the house			0
@entity39 also moved the kitchen into the basement and turned the upstairs dining room into the en - suite master bedroom			2
to make the most of the natural brightness inside , mirrors have been placed at strategic positions around the rooms and @entity39 has used limestone for some of the walls and flooring , which reflects light			0
@entity39 ’s quest to find the right balance between the old and the new has been achieved by restoring the house ’s original staircase , timber shutters and the fireplace in the front reception room			0
standing on the balcony overlooking the garden , which has also been given a full makeover , is the only place where @entity39 can imagine the @entity41 ambassador making an appearance in the house			1
‘ i can picture him enjoying a large cigar out here , ’ he jokes			0
@entity39 describes himself as ‘ nomadic ’ and he and his fashion producer wife @entity101 , 41 , and their children @entity151 , ten , @entity152 , seven and @entity153 , two , have moved out of the house and now live in @entity154			0
@entity155 , from @entity156 & @entity157 , says : ‘ the fact that it once housed the @entity26 of @entity41 adds an interesting bit of contemporary history to this pretty house			1
it ’s unusual to get such a stunning light and modern interior in a property of this type in @entity9			1
‘ no 8 , @entity42 is priced at £ 3.5 million and works out at £ 1,750 per square foot , which for this fabulous location represents fair market value , especially with its wow factor			1
