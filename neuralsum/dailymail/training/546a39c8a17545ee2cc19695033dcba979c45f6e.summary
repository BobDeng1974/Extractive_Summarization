tax cuts for millions of families could be implemented long before the deficit is eradicated , @entity0 said yesterday			1
the prime minister said we could benefit from slashed taxes much sooner than 2018 , when @entity7 is due to balance its books			2
he said there was no reason for public finances to be back in the black before a @entity14 government starts to lift the tax burden on hard - working families			2
it raises the prospect of the tax cuts coming in as early as 2016 – the first budget after the @entity21			1
the pm has suggested that tax cuts could be delivered sooner rather than later , saying that with a clear plan ‘ you do n’t have to wait until @entity7 is back in the black before you make progress with these reductions ' it comes after he electrified the @entity14 conference on wednesday with a dramatic pledge to raise the 40p income tax threshold from £ 41,900 to £ 50,000 by 2020			1
thousands of extra workers , including teachers and police officers , have been dragged into the band in recent years			0
yesterday he said he had ‘ no plans to raise vat ’ but did not rule out further savings from the defence budget after the next spending review in 2016			2
he also promised to raise the personal allowance to £ 12,500 if his party wins a second term in office to give a £ 500 - a - year boost to those on low incomes			1
it had been thought that the changes would not come in until chancellor @entity51 eliminates the deficit , which he says he is on course to do by 2018/19			0
but , on a trip to @entity55 yesterday , mr @entity0 suggested the threshold increases could start much sooner than had been expected			1
@entity0 talks to @entity58 firefighters in @entity59 , @entity60 , during his trip to @entity55 mr @entity0 said that the current parliament had shown that the government could make £ 100billion of cuts while also raising the income tax threshold at a cost of £ 9billion it was thought that the tax cuts , which will cost £ 7.2billion a year , would be delivered towards the end of the next parliament , as another £ 25billion of cuts are needed to balance the books			1
but speaking about the issue for the first time since his conference speech , mr @entity0 said they could be delivered sooner rather than later			1
the current parliament , he said , had shown that the government could make £ 100billion of cuts while also raising the income tax threshold at a cost of £ 9billion			1
he said : ‘ i think we have shown in the last parliament that it ’s perfectly possible – if you manage the nation ’s finances wisely – to deliver tax reductions at the same time as making savings and efficiencies			1
in the last parliament we had to make something like £ 100billion of cuts but also actually made tax cuts in terms of the personal allowance			1
‘ so in a parliament when we have to make further spending reductions – but not as much as in this parliament – i think it ’s perfectly possible to achieve the sort of tax reductions we have set out			1
attack : @entity51 yesterday @entity51 yesterday warned that @entity7 politics had returned to a battle between the @entity103 and the free market right not seen since the days of the @entity105			0
he urged bosses to stick up for the market – and warned that many pressure groups , charities and trade unions would be quick to put the anti-business point of view			0
he said in a speech to the @entity113 : ‘ you have to get out there and put the business argument			0
’ ‘ because there are plenty of pressure groups , plenty of trade unions and plenty of charities that will put the counter view			0
there is a big argument about our future , about whether we are a country that is for business , for enterprise , for the free market			0
mr @entity51 added : ‘ for the first time since my adult life , that is up for grabs			2
that issue felt it had been resolved when the @entity105 fell			0
‘ it does n’t mean you have to endorse a party , a party like the @entity14 , but it does mean you have to get out there and put the business argument … that is the only way we are going to win this argument for an enterprise , low - tax economy which delivers prosperity for generations to come			2
’ @entity150 leader @entity149 , said the chancellor had ‘ let down his guard to show how he agrees with @entity154 ’s “ enemy within ” rhetoric ’			0
‘ as long as you have got a clear plan and a clear pathway , you do n’t have to wait until @entity7 is back in the black before you make progress with these reductions			2
’ mr @entity0 would not be drawn on which departments would face the greatest reductions in their budgets , although he has already promised to protect spending on the health service for the next five years			1
‘ in terms of defence and other budgets , we have made some commitments on defence and to the defence equipment programme but greater details will be set out at the next election , ’ he said			0
all @entity177 countries have pledged to spend 2 per cent of their gdp on defence , and @entity7 is currently meeting this target			0
but analysis by senior military personnel leaked to the media this summer warned it would drop below this threshold in 2017 .			0

speaking in @entity55 , @entity185 suggested tax cuts could come as early as 2016
£ 25billion cut on government spending is still needed to balance the books
but mr @entity0 *insisted* that tax reductions costing £ *2.7billion* still possible
follows dramatic pledge to raise 40p income tax threshold to £ 50,000
also promised to raise personal allowance to £ 12,500 to boost low income
