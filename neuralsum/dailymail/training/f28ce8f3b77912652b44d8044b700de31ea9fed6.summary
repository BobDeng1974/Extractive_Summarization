by @entity0 published : 09:21 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 10:21 est , 1 august 2013 @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 might not be the obvious places to look for human rights infringements but according to @entity7 , many popular holiday spots are n't quite the paradise they appear to be			1
the countries all appear on a list of destinations described by the charity as concealing a " darker world of tragedy and human rights abuse			2
" others on the list include the @entity18 , the @entity19 and the @entity20 , as well as more obvious candidates such as the @entity22 , which earlier this year sentenced a teenage rape victim to 100 lashes for adultery , and @entity26 which has endured decades of civil war			1
problems : @entity2 is the top destination for @entity19 tourists but @entity7 says it has human rights issues protest : a demonstration against human rights abuses by @entity26 refugees took place in @entity36 last year in @entity37 , @entity2 was criticised for abuses including " excessive use of force " during demonstrations and a lack of justice for victims of the @entity45			1
@entity1 's burka ban also attracted censure , as did its fast track procedure for asylum applications , which @entity7 said fell short of international standards			0
@entity51 also fell foul of the charity , thanks to its abortion laws and overcrowded prisons , and @entity57 was criticised for its inadequate asylum system and heavy - handed policing of demonstrations			0
even @entity3 and the @entity18 did n't escape without some censure , with the former said to be discriminating against @entity61 and the latter being castigated for ' excessive use ' of immigration detention centres			0
meanwhile , the @entity22 , which has boasts an average of 958,000 international visitors a year , was reprimanded for attacks carried out by the police using truncheons and pepper - spray to crack down on largely peaceful demonstrations and reports that detainees have been tortured			0
beautiful @entity74 : but according to @entity7 , this picturesque scene conceals human rights abuses tough talking : home secretary @entity78 's robust stance on human rights has raised eyebrows the charity also pinpointed an incident that took place in may in which two juvenile offenders were sentenced to death - despite this being contrary to international law - as well as the case in which a 15 - year - old raped by her step - father was sentenced to 100 lashes			2
for @entity26 , @entity7 cited mounting evidence of mass war crimes during the conflict with the @entity95 and said that unlawful detentions , torture and enforced disappearances are " rife "			1
the @entity20 was singled out for extra criticism thanks to its continued use of capital punishment , overuse of tasers and @entity104			0
the @entity19 , which is the world 's eighth most popular holiday destination , was reprimanded by the charity for the " highly controversial " justice and @entity109 , which allows secret courts and for the recent reduction in the amount of legal aid available to prisoners			2
the charity also says " toxic language " surrounding human rights is common to the @entity19 and raises concerns about the possible scrapping of the @entity118 and withdrawal from the @entity120			1
" holidays are a time to relax and forget about life ’s headaches , and we ’re not expecting people to anxiously research the human rights situation of their holiday destinations , " said @entity7 @entity19 director @entity123			2
" but behind the sparkling seas , the luxurious hotels and picturesque landscapes , there ’s a darker reality of tragedy and human rights abuse			0
" holidaymakers may want to forget about hardship and injustice and that ’s understandable - but when the tan has faded and the holiday photos are filed away , this is a good time to engage with the issues that affect the locals long after the tourists have gone home			0
