but only £ 5million of new money has been announced , and the latest figures suggest churches are already unable to claim back more than half of the vat they incur on renovations			1
in the @entity61 , the proposal has been dubbed the ‘ thatch tax ’ because of its potential impact on the region ’s thatched cottages			0
@entity66 , secretary of the @entity67 , said : ‘ unfortunately 20 per cent is a huge amount of tax			0
