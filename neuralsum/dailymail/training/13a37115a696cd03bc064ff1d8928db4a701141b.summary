by @entity0 published : 05:55 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 12:32 est , 23 january 2013 britons have been urged to help prevent thousands of homes being flooded during the big thaw - by building an army of snowmen			1
with much of the country blanketed in white during the recent cold snap , families have been out in force to make sculptures in the snow , and the government wants to see even more built , for reasons of function as well as fun			2
with temperatures expected to swing from -13c to @entity18 at the weekend , the @entity15 suggested that snow and ice compacted into snowmen might melt more slowly than that left lying on the ground			1
fun and functional : building a snowman could help to prevent homes being flooded during the expected thaw at the weekend , the @entity15 says spokesman @entity29 said the slowing down the melt will mean there is less surface water come the time of a thaw			1
' ideally if everybody built themselves a snowman that will slow the thaw down a bit , ' he said			0
' if you notice when people clear their drive the snow thaws away but the compacted piles stay which will give a balanced thaw , which would be helpful			2
' ' we would rather it be a gradual thaw than a really quick one			0
' if it does go too quick we are likely to see a few flood alerts			0
if you are at risk of flooding make sure you have got all of your planning in place , ' mr @entity29 added			0
just doing our bit : @entity58 and ice will melt more slowly if it is compacted into snowmen than if it is simply lying on the ground fighting the flood : weather experts have predicted a sudden thaw when temperatures swing from -13c to @entity18 at the weekend dr @entity69 , forecaster at weatherweb.net , warned that localised flooding was likely to follow the thaw			1
' there is going to be a big swing in temperatures , from as low as -13c on friday night to @entity18 on tuesday , ' he said			1
' it will be really noticeable , and as the majority of @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 is under a layer of snow there will be a lot of standing water around			1
' we will see a lot of standing water around so there is likely to be localised flooding and driving conditions will not be good			2
' we are going to see a rise in temperatures next week followed by a cooling period again , but nothing like the freeze we have seen lately , ' he added			0
a spokesman for the @entity15 later said mr @entity29 was joking and added : ' while building snowmen is great fun , sadly it is unlikely to make a significant difference to the overall rate at which the snow melts			0
' the most important thing anyone can do to protect themselves from flooding is to check out if they are in a flood risk area , and sign up to free flood warnings on the @entity15 website			0

weather forecasters are predicted a sudden thaw when temperatures swing from -13c to @entity18 at the weekend
