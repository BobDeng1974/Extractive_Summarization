a protester in @entity1 was arrested during a demonstration on thursday night - and live - tweeted her entire experience			1
@entity4 , a nursing student at the @entity6 - @entity5 , was one of 13 people detained by officers in the conflicted @entity10 city for ' noise disruption '			1
the detention has sparked an investigation by the @entity14 as lawyers accuse officers of overstretching their powers			1
she started with the tweet : ' we are all arrested ' , apparently referring to herself an other members of the advocacy group @entity31			2
' tweeting while cuffed , ' she wrote , adding : ' we were arrested while on the side walk by the way '			1
according to her @entity35 feed , she was piled into a wagon with seven other people and not told where they were going			1
enraged , she then reported the reason the group was arrested : ' they said we violated the " noise " ordinance " it 's been 50 + days ... now they effort a noise ordinance			1
bull * * * * '			0
the group started chanting ' no justice , no peace ! ' in the back of the wagon			2
' they think it 's a game , ' she said			2
' @entity57 ' : ms @entity4 was one of 13 people from the advocacy group @entity59 who were arrested on the side walk during a demonstration ( pictured ) on thursday following @entity63 's death her followers informed her clergy were en route to the prison to offer support			1
arriving at @entity69 , they were dressed in orange jumpsuits , placed in a cell and ' treated like criminals ' , while officers said the bail would be doubled for anyone who had been arrested before			1
ms @entity4 's bail was set at $ 2,300 , she said			1
more than three hours after the arrest they were informed they would be released before the night was over , but ms @entity4 said : ' no one can give us clear answers on anything though			1
aside from the fact that we will be out and that people are working on it now			2
' she added : ' again , all 13 of us are still in jail , ' tweeting pictures of the four men and eight women she was sat with			0
around an hour later , after crowds swarmed around the police station , the group was released			2
local media reported protesters lay on the ground around the arrestees ' cars to stop them from being towed			0
many of the jail bonds were waived , according to the @entity105 account on @entity35 , but not for all			0
later , ms @entity4 told her followers : ' they straight criminalized us			1
made us stand in a cage			0
asked us if they turned their backs would we cause trouble			0
we are protestors ! ' ' the way we 've been treated you would think we are murderers , con artists , robbers			0
the mentality of the officers that handled us was insane			2
' @entity118 , an attorney for the @entity14 office in @entity120 , said several complaints have been lodged about thursday 's arrests and the @entity14 is investigating			1
' there do appear to be , if not bogus , at least unnecessary arrests , ' said @entity118 , who had no details about why the protesters were arrested			2
he also questioned why they 'd be jailed on a 24 - hour hold			0
' holding people unnecessarily long , arresting them when it 's not necessary â€” that 's an indication of overreach , ' @entity118 said			1
' it certainly appears that the purpose is to discourage people from coming to @entity1 to protest			0
' released : the nine women and four men celebrated as they were released and uncuffed hours later investigation : lawyers will now launch an investigation into unnecessary arrests made by @entity1 police conflict : last week , the police department was condemned by the @entity145 for refusing to effect change as it emerged numerous officers were still not wearing identification or covering their badges hundreds of people have been arrested during nearly two months of protests in @entity1 , including journalists and clergy members			1
the incident comes amid volatile outbursts in the city , where citizens and the @entity145 are accusing police of failing to take action to repair racial divides			0
in a letter to the @entity163 ( @entity163 ) last tuesday , the department said its own investigators have spotted officers without name tags and refusing to identify themselves to members of the public			0
the practise violates @entity163 rules , the department pointed out , and is illegal in many states			0
it added : ' the failure to wear name plates conveys a message to community members that , through anonymity , officers may seek to act with impunity '			0
just days later the letter was followed by a second on friday , as it emerged the first one had been ignored			0
' it further was reported to us that some officers affirmatively displaying these bracelets had black tape over their name plates			0
' the practice of not wearing , or obscuring , name plates violates your own department 's policies , which we advised you earlier this week when we requested that you end the practice imrnediately			0
' the second letter also addressed the news that officers were sporting ' i am @entity200 ' bracelets in an apparent show of solidarity to the man that shot @entity63 .			1

@entity4 , nursing student , was arrested with 12 people on thursday
they were calling on police take *responsibility* for @entity63 's death
ms @entity4 tweeted as she was arrested , piled in a small wagon with 7 others
they were accused of ' noise disruption ' , put in orange jumpsuits and cuffed
officers now being investigated , lawyers claim they ' overstretched powers '
