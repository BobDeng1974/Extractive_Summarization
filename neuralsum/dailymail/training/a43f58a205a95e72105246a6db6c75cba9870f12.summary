when @entity1 decided to give up smoking , she was looking forward to improving her health and her bank balance			1
like most ex-smokers , she was braced to gain some weight - but was totally unprepared for what happened to her bust			2
ms @entity1 , 46 , says her fluctuating weight - simply going from a size 10 to 12 - ' destroyed ' her @entity13 breasts			1
this is due to the stone in weight she gained suddenly after quitting - most of which went on her chest - and subsequently lost			1
@entity1 , 46 , says quitting her 30 - a - day smoking habit ' destroyed ' her @entity13 breasts ( she is pictured here before quitting )			1
ditching cigarettes made her gain weight , which she then lost , affecting her bust size and she claims quitting left them so deflated that she was forced to spend the cash she saved on cigarettes getting a breast enlargement			1
her new £ 4,000 breasts are , she says , an expensive reminder never to smoke again			2
she said : ‘ i never considered giving up smoking would have an effect on my bust but the changes my body went through completely ruined my breasts			1
‘ the cup size did n’t change , but because i gained and then lost weight on my boobs i lost all the volume so looked very flat and withered			1
‘ it was later explained to me that the sudden weight gain and loss on my breasts had caused sagginess			2
‘ i gave up smoking because i wanted to feel better about myself but i actually felt worse			2
‘ i could n’t believe i had gone through not only giving up smoking but then gaining and losing weight which only seemed to go to and from my breasts only to end up more unhappy with myself			1
‘ i ’d saved a fortune on cigarettes so i decided to go for surgery to reward myself			2
’ mrs @entity1 , who works as a lorry driver , started smoking when she was 16			1
for many years , she maintained a slim size 10 , weighing around nine stone while smoking 30 a day			1
at 5ft 6in tall , with a @entity52 , bust she felt perfectly in proportion			2
but that all changed three years ago in january 2012 when she gave up smoking as her @entity55 resolution			1
ms @entity1 said : ‘ the cup size did n’t change , but because i gained and then lost weight on my boobs i lost all the volume so looked very flat and withered			1
i gave up smoking because i wanted to feel better about myself but i actually felt worse ' and she claims quitting left them so deflated that she was forced to spend the cash she saved on cigarettes getting a breast enlargement , going from a @entity52 to @entity65 ( pictured ) her new £ 4,000 34e breasts are an expensive reminder never to smoke up again , she says she says : ‘ i ’d been thinking about it for a long time			1
i was worried about the effects on my health and the long term damage i had already caused to my body			0
‘ i should have done it years earlier and did n’t want to leave it any longer			0
’ former smokers gain up to 11lbs in weight after they kick the habit			0
@entity79 and @entity80 researchers found that former smokers gained an average of 10lbs in the 12 months after they quit			0
most of the excess weight is gained during the first three months , they found			0
it is nearly double the typical 6.6lbs quoted in quitting advice leaflets			0
analysing the results from 62 studies , the authors discovered that in the first three months after giving up , former smokers gain an average of 6.3lbs			0
however , researchers found a large variation in weight change , with 13 per cent of people gaining more than 22lbs and 16 per cent losing some weight			1
the study , published on bmj.com , was accompanied by an editorial which suggests that health benefits from quitting outweigh the excess weight gain			1
but like many who stop smoking , mrs @entity1 began to put on weight - and found most of it settled on her chest			1
she said : ‘ i filled the gap left by smoking with biscuits ands nibbles			0
it kept my fingers busy but unfortunately that meant it started to show on my body			0
‘ i filled out a little all over but the difference was mainly to my bust which seemed to swell			0
' i told myself it was still preferable to smoking and that i would tackle the weight gain once i was smoke free			2
’ so the following year when she was confident that she had beaten her addiction , mrs @entity1 who had gone up to a size 12 , decided to lose the weight			1
she ditched snacking and started running until she was back in a size 10 dress and then even slipped down to a size eight weighing around eight stone			1
but when she became very aware that the process had had a terrible effect on her bust - which she describes as looking like ‘ two empty flaps of skin			0
’ she said : ‘ there was never a huge amount there but what i was left with was awful			0
‘ i started wearing padded bras and trying to disguise the loss of volume			0
i was very self conscious about my bust for the first time in my life			0
‘ it felt like a bit of a kick in the face when i had worked so hard on quitting smoking and losing weight only to be left with another problem			1
’ she said : ‘ the odd thing is that i do n’t look massively different now to before when i smoked , but the volume is back and i ’m delighted ' so when she calculated how much she had saved by breaking her habit she decided to reward herself with breast surgery			2
she said : ' i booked a consultation at the transform cosmetic surgery clinic and explained that giving up smoking had destroyed my boobs			0
' i asked if i could be restored to how i looked before			0
‘ the surgeon was wonderful and honestly explained that the sudden weight gain and loss on my breasts had caused sagginess			2
‘ to avoid needing an uplift too he suggested i go for slightly larger implants to fill out the loose skin i had been left with			0
’ last year she went under the knife at the company 's hospital in @entity172 to go from a @entity52 to a @entity173			0
she said : ‘ the odd thing is i do n’t look massively different now to before when i smoked , but the volume is back and i ’m delighted			0
‘ this is my reward to myself and every time i look in the mirror i am reminded how far i have come and never ever to smoke again			0

@entity1 , from @entity179 , had always been happy with her *34b* breasts
three years ago she decided to give up smoking for health reasons
ended up gaining 1st and a dress size due to snacking instead of smoking
after losing the weight , says her bust looked ' saggy and deflated '
used money saved by quitting to pay for £ *4k* boob op and go to @entity65
