beachgoers using an historic @entity2 boardwalk in the prudish 1950s were breaking the law if they did not cover up			2
the problem for walkers in @entity6 , @entity7 , however , is that the bathing suits ban was never repealed			1
@entity10 , 74 , a former city councilwoman , has told authorities to start enforcing the largely forgotten rule once again			1
a policeman would warn people not wearing shoes by blowing his whistle at them , she said			0
she has revealed that the law is still in force and offenders these days face a fine of up to $ 2,000 ( £ 1,300 ) , community service and even 90 days in jail			2
ms @entity10 says she wants to restore the city 's reputation for decency and modesty , which she claims is being ruined by the sight of skimpy swimsuits			1
she wants beachgoers to put on a shirt if they stroll along the boardwalk , which was built in 1880 and is mentioned in @entity44 's 1973 song ' 4th of july , @entity6 ( @entity45 ) '			1
critic : @entity47 ( pictured ) told @entity48 the idea of enforcing the bathing suit ban was ' ridiculous ' boardwalk empire : @entity6 lies within @entity52 in @entity7 she told @entity20 : ' we 're going to end up like any other seedy boardwalk in some seashore town			1
' ' do you really want to be sitting in a restaurant and seeing somebody come up half - dressed ? i never walked in a bar in a bathing suit			0
' the 1958 @entity52 decree , which has not been enforced for several years , reads : ' no person clad in bathing attire shall be on the boardwalk or the public sidewalks adjacent thereto			1
' but calls to enforce the rule again have been met with disbelief by many in the local community , including councilman @entity74 , who views the law as ' archaic ' , @entity20 reported			0
he said enforcing it would create additional man hours			0
' with the state cutting back and the city cutting back , that raises taxes , ' said mr @entity74			2
' so i ’m gon na have people riding around on bikes looking , checking swimsuits ? no. ' city manager @entity86 said			2
' we ’re not going to start arresting them or throwing them off the boardwalk			2
' the boss : @entity44 's 1973 song ' 4th of july , @entity6 ( @entity45 ) ' mentions the boardwalk @entity94 : @entity10 says she wants to restore @entity6 's reputation for decency and modesty , which she says is being ruined by the sight of skimpy swimsuits law is ' archaic ' : councilman @entity74 ( pictured ) said the decree would not be enforced @entity102 , a local business owner , told @entity20 : ' we 're a community of free thinkers , of creative people , and to tell people to put on clothing at the beach just negates that			1
' and @entity47 told @entity48 : ' i totally disagree that people should n't be allowed to wear bathing suits on the boardwalk			0
it 's a beach community			0
' it 's the stupidest thing i ever heard and it should be stricken from the books			0
' there are some , though , that do back ms @entity10 's crusade			1
one man said : ' they should n't be out here all the time with bathing suits because it does not look good at all			0
' in the past there were changing rooms connected to the beach via catwalks and tunnels but since they went , people have had to use the boardwalk			0
ms @entity10 may also have a bone to pick with @entity44 due to his seedy representation of the boardwalk and local people in ' 4th of july , @entity6 ( @entity45 ) '			1
' @entity44 ' describes people in the song in an unflattering light including the ' stoned - out faces , switchblade lovers ' and ' the greasers ' who ' tramp the streets or get busted for sleeping out on the beach all night '			1
he sings that the ' wizards play down on @entity148 on the boardwalk way past dark ' and says he is tired of ' hangin ' in them dusty arcades ' and ' @entity153 ' the factory girls underneath the boardwalk where they promise to unsnap their jeans '			0
the way it was : in this old picture of @entity15 , which was built in 1880 , everybody is well covered up			0
