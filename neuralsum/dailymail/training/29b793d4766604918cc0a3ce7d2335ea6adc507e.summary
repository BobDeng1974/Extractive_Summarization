findings : overall , a third of those identifying as @entity5 are non white , the @entity2 report said following a survey of 121,000 people poorer blacks and @entity10 are more likely to be gay than wealthier whites , a controversial study claimed yesterday			1
a @entity2 survey – said to be the largest of its kind ever undertaken in @entity14 – estimated that 3.4 per cent of @entity14 adults saw themselves as lesbian , gay , bisexual or transgender ( @entity5 )			1
that figure consisted of 4.6 per cent of african - americans , 4.3 per cent of @entity10 , 4 per cent of @entity21 – but only 3.2 per cent of whites			1
in contrast to earlier , smaller studies , researchers also found that @entity14 with the lowest levels of education were most likely to say they were gay			0
a similar pattern was found in wealth , with more than 5 per cent of those with annual incomes of under £ 15,000 identified as gay compared with 2.8 per cent earning more than £ 37,000 a year			0
and while 21 per cent of @entity14 adults earn more than £ 56,000 a year , only 16 per cent of gay people claimed to earn that much			1
the survey – based on interviews with more than 121,000 people – contradicts the perception that lesbians and gays are mostly white , urban and affluent , said lead author @entity39			1

‘ but this data reveals that relative to the general population , the @entity5 population has a larger proportion of non-white people and clearly is not overly wealthy			0

findings : the @entity2 survey , released this week , was based on interviews with more then 121,000 people , and showed that 3.4 per cent of adults fell into the @entity5 category in @entity14 the results show that fewer white people said they were @entity5 while 4.6 per cent of black people ticked ' yes ' the survey also found that geography did n't really make a difference to whether people were @entity5 the survey noted that it could not account for those not admitting their sexual preference			1
very little research has been done into which races are more likely to be homosexual			0
estimates of the proportion of the population who are lesbian or gay range from 2 per cent to 10 per cent , although recent @entity14 surveys have put it at around 4 per cent			2
in 2010 , a survey by the @entity88 concluded that 1.5 per cent of @entity89 identified themselves as gay or bisexual , although a 2008 poll put the proportion at 6 per cent			2
