by @entity0 warning : @entity1 yesterday said a rise in the base rate was on the way , despite the risk that it could push the country back into a recession household debt is a ‘ major risk ’ to the economy and could tip @entity11 back into recession when interest rates rise , the @entity9 ’s governor declared yesterday			1
@entity1 said that many families are in ‘ a vulnerable position ’ having overstretched themselves to get onto , or move up , the housing ladder			2
any large rise in mortgage or loan rates would mean less money being spent in shops – reversing the economy ’s upward trend			1
but in a stark warning to borrowers , he added that despite the risks , the first increase since 2007 is on the way			2
mr @entity1 said the housing market could spiral out of control if interest rates are left too low for too long			1
‘ the @entity11 economy is starting to head back to normal , ’ said the @entity35 in a speech in @entity37			1
‘ as the economy normalises , @entity39 will need to start to rise			2
’ mr @entity1 repeated his message that the central bank plans that any rises in interest rates will be ‘ gradual and limited ’ to cushion the blow for highly - indebted borrowers			2
but he warned that if rates rise more quickly than expected it could ‘ tip the economy into recession ’ because people cut back spending elsewhere to pay their mortgages			1
‘ it is the prospects for household indebtedness that concern us , ’ said mr @entity1			0
‘ history shows that the @entity11 people do everything they can to pay their mortgages			0
that means cutting back deeply on expenditures when the unexpected happens			0
‘ if a lot of people are highly indebted , that could tip the economy into recession			0
since we start from a vulnerable position we need to be especially careful			0
’ mr @entity1 said that with household debt worth 140 per cent of disposable income , rates will stay ‘ materially lower ’ than the 5 per cent average seen before the financial crisis			1
he warned that this level of debt is ‘ a major risk ’ to economic stability			0
a report published today says dealing with ‘ the household debt hangover ’ must be a priority as the ‘ holiday period ’ of low borrowing costs ends			0
the @entity83 think - tank warns that the number of mortgage holders who are spending more than one third of their income on repayments could balloon from 1.1million today to 2.3million by 2018			2
the number of households in ‘ debt peril ’ – meaning they are spending more than half of their income on debt repayments – could increase from 600,000 to 1.1million			0
' household indebtedness concerns us ' : mr @entity1 listens as he is introduced before speaking at the @entity100 in @entity37 , @entity101 , yesterday rates have been frozen at an emergency low of 0.5 per cent since the depths of ‘ the @entity105 ’ in march 2009			1
but the @entity11 is now the fastest growing advanced economy in the world and jobs are being created at a record pace			0
this has led many observers to believe that interest rates will rise to 0.75 per cent later this year or early next year before reaching 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent in 2017			1
that would push up mortgage costs for millions – although it would be welcomed by savers who have lost out since the financial crisis			0
issuing a warning on the housing market , mr @entity1 said : ‘ @entity121 is well aware that a prolonged period of historically low interest rates could encourage other risks to develop			1
in the @entity11 , the biggest risks are associated with the housing market			1
’ he was recently accused of behaving like ‘ an unreliable boyfriend ’ over his apparent changes of heart on when rates will rise			2
yesterday he refused to be drawn on exactly when the first rise will come .			0

the @entity35 @entity9 governor warns that a rate rise is on the way
with no increase , the housing market could spiral out of control , he says
rates have been kept at 0.5 per cent since the depths of the crisis in 2009
