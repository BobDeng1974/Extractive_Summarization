a retired @entity0 admitted in court thursday to killing his wife over a @entity5 game bet			1
@entity6 , who has been charged with second degree murder in the 2011 killing of his common law wife @entity9 , said in court in @entity11 that he only killed her because he feared for his life			1
on august 11 , 2011 - the night that @entity9 died - the two had played a @entity5 video game after drinking alcohol and eating dinner			1
dangerous games : @entity6 , left , killed his wife @entity9 , right , after he refused to fulfill the terms of a bet hedged during a @entity5 game @entity6 said they usually waged bets of a sexual nature , and that @entity9 had won the game that night			1
bet : apparently the deadly fight started over a risque game of @entity5 later , when he went to bed , @entity6 found sex toys scattered across his pillow			1
@entity6 , who wanted to get rest before a golf game the next day , pushed the toys aside and tried to go to sleep			1
that 's when @entity9 became upset			2
@entity6 said that she confronted him multiple times and then suggested that he did n't want to have sex because he was n't attracted to her and that he wanted to go to work in @entity42 to get out of their relationship			1
' i said " no , it 's nothing to do with that			0
i just need to get some sleep , " ' @entity6 said			2
he went back to rest , but @entity9 would n't give up			2
he told her to go sleep in the spare room and thought that worked until he was woken up later by @entity9 hitting him			0
something had changed , @entity6 noticed			0
and he began to fear for his life			0
' she was not @entity9			0
she was crazy and she 'd just assaulted me when i was sound asleep , and i was worried about what was coming next , ' he recalled			0
so he pulled out the handgun he kept in his bedside table for protection			0
when @entity9 burst through the bedroom again , this time with a knife , @entity6 shot her once in the head			1
he then says that he put his gun back in his holster and went to throw up in the bathroom			0
he called 911 , got dressed and waited for police outside			0
shot dead : @entity6 said @entity9 came at him with a knife , and that 's why he shot her according to @entity6 , this was the first fight that the couple ever had			1
but the prosecution and experts found faults in @entity6 testimony			2
first of all , it was n't the first fight			0
crown counselor @entity80 pointed out that they had been in an argument before when @entity6 stopped @entity9 from breaking into @entity84 's dressing room at a concert and flashing her breasts			1
' that 's the only time we had a disagreement with each other , ' @entity6 said			0
a forensic pathologist also found it strange that @entity93 was found with the knife in her hand			1
if she was shot she would have dropped the knife , or if she grasped it as she fell to the floor , it would n't have been easy to pry from her hands			2
' i did n't touch @entity9 in anyway , shape or form , ' @entity6 responded			2
the trial continues monday .			0

@entity6 and wife @entity9 had hedged a bet over a @entity5 game
when @entity6 wanted to go to bed instead of have sex with his wife , he says she turned violent
she came at him with a knife , and in self - *defense* @entity6 said he shot her once in the head
an expert testified that @entity93 would not have been found with a knife in her hand , or - if she had - it would have been *difficult* to pry away
