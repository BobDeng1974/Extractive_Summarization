by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 07:09 est , 3 may 2013 good samaritan : but this photograph of @entity3 was put on a police poster accusing him of being a suspect in the @entity7 riots a @entity8 who went out of his way to help the vulnerable during the @entity7 riots has won a pay - out from police after officers published posters accusing him of being involved with the violence			1
@entity3 , who volunteers for numerous charities in @entity18 , was thanked by multiple officers for protecting bystanders on the night of august 8 2011			1
but a few months later he was shocked to see his face plastered all over adverts which described him as a possible suspect			0
the @entity24 has now agreed to pay the 49 - year - old substantial damages after a judge at the @entity27 in @entity7 ruled that it had libelled him by continuing to distribute the posters even after he complained			2
mr @entity3 was ' widely respected ' in @entity18 , according to his lawyer @entity31 , and on the night that rioting broke out in the area he took to the streets to make sure that no one was in danger			1
he escorted a distressed elderly woman away from the unrest , removed debris near a bus so the driver could continue his journey and helped people who were trapped in a building near a burning car			0
however , in may 2012 he noticed his photograph on a poster headed ' @entity48 ' which police had distributed to be displayed in local shops			2
the advert asked for help from the public in identifying those pictured , including mr @entity3 , who were described as having been ' involved in the disorder '			1
' this was extremely distressing to the claimant , ' mr @entity56 said			0
' not only was it false in his case , but he felt his safety to be at risk as there had been revenge attacks following the riots			0
' mr @entity3 contacted his local police station to point out the error , and officers told him that the posters would soon by replaced and his picture removed			1
however , his photograph remained on the @entity73 website until june 15 , and a picture of him provided by police was published by the @entity76 on june 7			0
moreover , the posters with his face on remained on display in the borough for a further two months			0
violence : mr @entity3 ( not pictured ) helped police by protecting vulnerable residents of @entity18 mr @entity3 repeatedly had to explain to neighbours , shopkeepers and even his employer that he had not in fact been involved with the violence			1
the @entity24 initially denied the plaintiff 's case , but later admitted that mr @entity3 had been seriously libelled by the continuation of the poster campaign			1
officials have apologised and agreed to pay mr @entity3 's legal costs as well as damages			2
@entity97 , for the police , defended the campaign , saying it helped to bring thousands of rioters to justice			0
he also pointed out that after mr @entity3 initially came forward , officers told the @entity76 of their mistake and informed the newspaper that he was in fact a public - spirited ' @entity8 '			2
' the @entity24 are sorry that the steps taken to remove and replace the posters from local shops proved inadequate to correct the position , that mr @entity3 's image was not promptly removed from the police website and that they failed to ensure that mr @entity3 's image was not published in the @entity76 , ' mr @entity97 said			1
' it is accepted that these failures have caused damage to the claimant 's reputation and have caused him much distress and great concern			0

@entity3 , 49 , protected vulnerable bystanders in @entity18 during riots
but police later put his photo on poster *seeking* suspects in violence
@entity24 admits it was too slow to recall poster after mr @entity3 complained
