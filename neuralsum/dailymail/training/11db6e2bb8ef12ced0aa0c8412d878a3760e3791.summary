a plain - package law for tobacco products would reduce the appeal of smoking , according to a new study			1
this follows the recent legislation in @entity7 banning logos from cigarette packaging and the @entity11 ban on tobacco promotion in april this year			1
@entity11 has some of the strictest anti-smoking laws in the world with advertising and smoking in pubs and restaurants already banned , but new research claims that removing logos from cigarette packs would reduce the appeal even further			1
logo no - go : the research supports the introduction of plain packaging as it reduced the appeal of smoking in @entity27 a consultation was made by the @entity28 on plain packaging last month , the results of which have yet to be published			2
@entity27 public health minister @entity32 have said that the government is already considering whether plain packaging of tobacco could bring public health benefits in this country			0
the research suggests that plain packaging and the removal of brand descriptors are likely to reduce the appeal of smoking for young adults , supporting the recommendations for plain packaging			0
the @entity7 way : this prototype unbranded pack is what will be sold in @entity7 after the ban comes into force the study was made by a research group at the @entity54 , @entity55			1
the report , published today in @entity58 ’s open access journal @entity59 , compared the appeal of branded and plain packs among women in @entity63			1
the authors found that many brands appear to specifically target young women by use of ‘ feminine ’ coloured packs , fruit flavourings , or by suggestive terms such as ‘ slim ’ or ‘ superslim ’			2
the women were quizzed to see if these cigarettes had the same appeal when presented in plain packaging which still had the brand name and description on them			0
as a final test , the women were able to choose which they would have preferred as a free gift , one of the plain or branded pack			0
dr @entity87 also from the @entity54 who led this study explained : ‘ the women in this study rated branded packs as more appealing , more stylish and sophisticated than the plain packs			1
‘ they also thought that cigarettes in branded packs would be better tasting and smoother			1
‘ removal of all description from the packs , leaving only the brand , further reduced their appeal			0
‘ in the pack offer test , participants were three times more likely to choose the branded pack as a free gift			0
’ benefits : introducing plain packaging could reduce the number of young people taking up smoking tobacco use is responsible for 5.4 million deaths every year across the world and is a leading cause of preventable death			0
like many other countries , @entity63 has prohibited most forms of tobacco advertising , but has not addressed the issue of marketing by tobacco companies via the cigarette pack itself			0
the results from this study , the first to look at the effect of plain cigarette , backs up research in other countries , which has found that plain packaging makes cigarettes less appealing to young people , the authors noted .			2

research found branded packs more *attractive*
@entity7 have already banned branded tobacco products
