by @entity0 @entity3 @entity2 mp @entity1 was sacked as the party ’s vice-chairman last night over his ‘ uncontrollable ’ behaviour on @entity7 – including jokes about having an affair with a llama and criticism of senior ministers			1
mr @entity1 , one of @entity14 ’s most colourful mps , has built up a cult following on the social media site with his edgy comments and lewd jokes			2
but his outpourings have caused alarm at @entity2 high command in recent months			2
sacked : @entity1 ( left ) was ousted from his post as @entity2 vice-chairman after tweeting his relief following @entity26 's resignation message : the former whip informed his @entity7 followers after he was removed from his position ' i 'd prefer to date @entity32 than @entity33 ' the final straw appears to have been a series of hostile messages about beleaguered culture secretary @entity26 , culminating in one saying ‘ about time ’ when she finally resigned yesterday morning			1
he later added : ‘ note to self : if ever a minister again , be like @entity40			2
if in trouble , resign quickly and in a dignified manner			1
’ last night he was summoned for talks with @entity2 chairman @entity44 and asked to resign			1
when he refused , he was sacked			0
a source close to mr @entity44 last night insisted that his departure was mainly down to his opposition to the government ’s plans for a new high - speed rail line between @entity51 , @entity52 and the @entity53			2
the £ 50billion @entity55 line would carve a swathe through mr @entity1 ’s @entity58 constituency			1
he has tabled an amendment to the legislation which would kill the plans if it is backed by @entity13 later this month			0
he has also vowed to defy a three - line whip to vote against the main legislation			0
he is one of around 30 mps along the line of the route who are expected to rebel against the plans when they come to the @entity69 at the end of this month			0
‘ this has been coming for a while , ’ the source said			0
‘ you ca n’t have a vice-chairman of the party publicly defying the government and trying to kill off a key piece of legislation			0
’ the source acknowledged that mr @entity1 ’s public criticism of @entity82 and the former conservative chief whip @entity83 had also played a part in his departure , but insisted it was ‘ amicable ’			1
another senior @entity2 source said mr @entity1 ’s @entity7 outpourings were the main reason for his sacking			1
‘ @entity91 once said too many tweets make a t * * * , and this is a case in point , ’ the source said			0
mr @entity1 , 63 , announced his sacking to his 14,900 followers on @entity7 last night , saying : ‘ @entity97 asked to resign as vice chairman , refused , so sacked over @entity55 and my views on a recent cabinet minister			1
still available for speeches etc. ’ he added : ‘ now free to speak openly about llamas ( in - joke ) and other matters			0
’ the message was a reference to a @entity7 exchange earlier this year , after mr @entity1 had tweeted his condemnation of @entity110 ’s gay rights record			1
when a reader asked about his own sexuality , mr @entity1 replied he was having an affair with a llama but would not reveal its gender			2
a source at the time said the party ’s high command was unamused , adding : ‘ no 10 says it has had enough problems with the party in getting equal marriage through without you advocating bestiality			0
’ another @entity2 last night described mr @entity1 as ‘ uncontrollable ’			1
for years the mp was best known at @entity127 for his extraordinary blond hair , which he has always denied is a wig			0
but his @entity7 fame has enabled him to build up a wider profile , including an appearance on have i got news for you			0
opinion : earlier in the day , he made his views on @entity26 's expenses scandal known			0
hours later the @entity139 resigned from her position bizarre : following his sacking , the mp said : ' now free to speak openly about llamas ' criticism : the colourful mp also had outspoken views of the £ 50billion @entity55 rail link ousted : mr @entity1 was asked to resign , but refused , so was sacked by party chairman @entity44 ( pictured )			1

former whip @entity1 was outspoken in his criticism of rail link
@entity58 mp is set to lead a @entity2 revolt against the £ 50 billion *scheme*
asked to resign but refused , so was ousted by chairman @entity44
*prolific* @entity7 *updated* followers with a message following sacking
added on his page : ' note to self : if ever a minister again *...* resign quickly '
