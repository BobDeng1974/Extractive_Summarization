the blond - haired , blue - eyed killer called out to the campers and asked them to come closer			1
unsuspecting and trusting , they came over but when they did he killed them in a random and unprovoked attack			1
according to one witness , he then shouted for them to come and said : ' it 's safe to come out			1
. i 'm a cop ! ' the gunman , who has been identified as @entity12 , 32 , killed at least 80 people at an island summer youth camp north west of @entity15 on @entity16			1
massacre : rescue workers evacuate young people from the summer school meeting in @entity16 his boots crunching along as he sought out his victims and wearing what appeared to be a police uniform , he shot at them twice to make sure they were dead			1

he said : ' we were 30 - 40 people standing together when he started shooting			1
when he was done [ with us ] there were only five or six left of us			2
' mr @entity27 then escaped to a nearby cave where he hid with a number of other youths			0
' people were seriously injured , lying all around us			0
we did n't dare to go out of the cave , fearing that the gunman would discover our whereabouts , ' he said to @entity41 newspaper @entity40 " i 've never lost anyone close before			1
considering that , it 's pretty dramatic to start off by losing 85 great friends			1
" mr @entity27 described the assailant as very calm , as he made sure his victims were indeed dead by shooting them twice			0
" he just did n't seem to care , " he added			0
one of @entity12 's victims , @entity50 , who was shot in the shoulder as he lay face down , playing dead , said he heard the killer shouting about how everyone was going to die			1
the 21 - year - old said : ' he yelled out that he was going to kill us all and that we must all die			1
i started speculating and thinking this ca n't be real because @entity41 people would n't attack @entity41			1
' gunman : @entity12 has been arrested by police after the shooting in @entity16 mr @entity50 also described how he could hear the blue - eyed gunman 's boots as he walked along the rocks and felt his breath moments before he shot him in the back			1
' i was lying on a rock , face down and i could hear him coming			0
i could feel his breath			0
' as he approached , he shot at me to see if i was dead and fortunately i did n't move so he thought i was dead			1
' i was laying there for two hours , still healthy but very cold			0
' before he was shot mr @entity50 said he had tried to escape the island by swimming into the ocean but only managed a short distance before deciding to turn back			1
' i jumped into the water like the rest of the people but i did not have time to take my clothes off and it had started to rain			0
' when i had swum about 100 metres i felt i had to turn back because i started to get very cold and felt i might meet a certain death			0
' once he reached the shore he saw @entity12 who pointed his gun at him			0
' i screamed to him , please no please			0
i did n't know if he did n't want to just kill me because i was one person or if he preferred to kill a group of people			2
another teenager , aged 15 , who took refuge in the village of @entity89 after the massacre said she stood just feet away from the gunman when he opened fire on the camp			2
' i saw many dead people , " said 15 - year old @entity94			2
the teenager said she had just come out from an information meeting in a nearby building when she heard gunshots			0
tragic : a survivor of the shootings is comforted by a paramedic after the attack at the summer camp rescuers take away and injured person brought ashore from the camp site she saw a police officer and thought she was safe , but then he started shooting			1
' he first shot people on the island			1
afterwards he started shooting people in the water , " she said			0
@entity94 said she hid behind the same rock that the killer was standing on			0
" i could hear his breathing from the top of the rock , " she said			0
in panic , the girl phoned her parents , whispering to them what was going on			0
' they told me not to panic and that everything would be ok , " she said.her parents also told her to get rid of a brightly coloured jacket she was wearing to not draw attention to herself			0
suspect : @entity12 is being questioned by police over the shootings she said it was impossible to say how many minutes passed while she was waiting for him to stop			1
survivors described a scene of sheer terror at the camp , which is organised by the youth wing of @entity41 's ruling @entity138			1
hundreds of young people were eagerly awaiting a speech the prime minister was to give there today			0
police said the man arrested in the shooting is @entity41 and had set off a bomb that killed seven people outside the prime minister 's headquarters in @entity15 , about 20 miles from the camp			1
several of the survivors seemed calm as anxious parents picked them up at a @entity89 hotel , but the stories they told were of utter terror			2
@entity156 said the fake police officer ordered people to come closer , then pulled weapons and ammunition from a bag and started shooting			2
several victims " had pretended as if they were dead to survive , " the 21 - year - old said			2
but after shooting the victims with one gun , the gunman shot them again in the head with a shotgun , he said			1
" i lost several friends , " said mr @entity156 , whose trousers were stained with blood			0
he said he used the mobile phone of one of his fallen friends to call police			2
@entity177 told @entity178 she ran inside a school building and hid under a bed when the shooting started			0
' at one point the shooting was very , very close ( to ) the building , i think actually it actually hit the building one time , and the people in the next room screamed very loud , " she said			0
emergency : a helicopter hovers above the rescue area preparing to take victims of the attack to hospital ' i laid under the bed for two hours and then the police smashed a window and came in			1
it seems kind of unreal , especially in @entity41			1
this is not something that could happen here			0
' another camper , @entity202 , stayed in touch with his sister through the attack through text messages			2
' he sent me a text saying ' there 's been gunshots			2
i am scared ( expletive )			0
but i am hiding and safe			0
i love you , ' " said @entity210 , a 25 - year - old graphic designer in @entity211 , @entity41			1
as he boarded a boat from the island after the danger had passed he sent one more text : " i 'm safe			2
' an aerial view of @entity16 , @entity41 , taken a day before the shootings			1

' he yelled out that he was going to kill us all and that we must all die , ' says survivor shot in the attack
police still *searching* island 's surrounding waters for *bodies*
gunman had 30 minutes for killing spree before swat team arrived
queen : ' i am deeply *saddened* and *shocked* by the tragic loss of life '
stay indoors , @entity241 urges @entity243 *visitors*
*deadliest* day in @entity245 since @entity247 train bombings
it seems it 's not @entity252 terror - related . ' this seems like a madman 's work
@entity41 's *pm* who spent many summers on @entity16 : ' my *childhood* *paradise* was *transformed* into hell '
