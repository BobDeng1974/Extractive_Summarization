by @entity0 published : 22:12 est , 2 march 2014 updated : 23:02 est , 2 march 2014 this week marks the thirtieth anniversary of the commencement of the miners ' strike of 1984 - 1985			1
three decades on and the effects of @entity9 ’s infamous industrial struggle are still being felt			1
the strike started on march 6 , 1984 , when @entity12 chairman , sir @entity11 , announced that four million tonnes of capacity was to be taken out of the industry , leading to a loss of 20,000 jobs across the @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , which would lose their primary source of employment			1
on march 12 , 1984 , the strike went national , with @entity23 ( @entity25 ) president , @entity24 , calling for @entity25 members in all coal fields to down tools			1
@entity30 's wife @entity29 ( left ) was one of the many miners and their families who protested the closures of the mines across the country			2
she is pictured here outside @entity37 a picketer , injured during clashes with police at the @entity41 near @entity42 , is helped away by his comrades			0
an estimated 20,000 people were injured or admitted to hospital during course of strike and three people were killed police officers move into the picket lines at the @entity52 coking plant near @entity42 in 1984 , where more than a dozen arrests were made it was one of the most bitter industrial disputes in the nation ’s history and a key part of @entity61 ’s legacy as prime minister			1
within a week , most of the country ’s 183,000 miners had downed tools and a daily routine was established in many coal towns , of miners picketing outside collieries			2
the protests were often violent , with large numbers of police sent in to restrain picketers , with an estimated 20,000 people injured or admitted to hospital			2
during the course of the strike , three men were killed – two on the picket lines and a taxi - driver who was driving a coal miner , who had crossed the picket lines , to work			1
families and communities were riven with division over the dispute and torn apart by the poverty brought about by a year of downed tools			2
the effects of the strike are still felt across the nation , with those ‘ scabs ’ who crossed the picket lines still snubbed in the streets of mining towns 30 years on			1
‘ people have long memories , ’ explained @entity100 , 66 - year - old former @entity25 lodge secretary in the ex-pit village of @entity102 , @entity103			1
‘ there 's very few people [ who ] talk to them and it split families			0
’ picketing miners make a run for it as violence flares at the @entity52 coking plant			0
the bitter industrial dispute began in march 1984 after the announcement that 20,000 jobs would be cut due to closures of coal mines across the country defining episode : the miners ' strike was one of the defining moments of @entity61 's prime ministership @entity128 : @entity25 president @entity24 salutes at a march and rally by striking miners in @entity133 , @entity134 in may 1984 ( left )			1

during the course of the strike , three men were killed police officers moving into the picket lines at the @entity52 coking plant near @entity42 a mass rally of striking miners in @entity133 , @entity134 in may 1984			1
the strikes began in march 1984 and continued for a year the closure of the mines has devastated communities across the country			1
mr @entity100 says that @entity102 ’s reliance on coal meant that the pit ’s closure was disastrous			0
‘ it 's been total devastation , ’ he said			0
‘ it 's my worst nightmare and i knew it was going to happen			0
’ whereas the @entity164 planned pit closures in their coalfields , ‘ here , they just wiped us out ’			0
mr @entity100 says that the colliery houses were sold off to landlords in the 1990s , and there was an influx of problem tenants and class a drugs into the village			0
shops closed down and the once vibrant community life died out			0
the strikers were known as @entity128 after @entity25 president , @entity24 , who became a fixture on @entity9 television and radio during the strike			2
there is no sign that mr @entity24 , who is now 76 and has removed himself from public life , will be attending the commemorative events planned for the 30 - year anniversary			2
in 1984 he warned miners that the government had a long - term plan to destroy the industry , closing more than 70 pits across the country			1
the government denied these claims and @entity11 wrote to every member of the @entity25 claiming that mr @entity24 was deliberately lying to them and there were no plans to close any more pits than what had been announced			2
cabinet papers released in 2014 , under the 30 - year rule , indicated that @entity11 , who died in 1998 , did wish to close 75 pits over three years			1
these revelations prompted veteran @entity205 mp , @entity204 , to call on the @entity206 , @entity207 , to review statements made by the @entity61 government during the strike , to see how their statements from the @entity212 matched with internal documents , reported the @entity214			0
more than 200 miners were arrested during the year of picketing and spent time in custody or jail @entity24 ( left ) was assisted by riot police after he was injured outside the @entity52 coking plant near @entity42			1
( @entity135 ) pictured in 1981 , the @entity25 president is now 76 and does not live in the public eye			0
it is uncertain whether the man who was at the heart of the strike will be involved in the 30 year commemorative events @entity228 , secretary of the @entity25 , addresses the miners picket , watched by police at the @entity231 , near @entity232 , during the year - long miners strike two of the working @entity25 men , electrician @entity235 , and medic @entity236 ( right ) about to start a shift at the @entity239 colliery in august 1984 police helping an injured colleague outside the @entity52 coking plant , near @entity42 police clear a burning barricade so a bus carrying return - to - work miners can enter @entity244			1
communities were divided by the miners ' strike			2
30 years later and those who crossed the picket lines are still snubbed by many in their communities the strike was ultimately unsuccessful , with miners returning to work in early 1985 due to financial hardship , and the strike was called off on march 4 that year			1
@entity256 , 73 , a former miner and vice-president of the @entity258 , told the @entity259 this year that ‘ the victory was in the struggle itself			0
’ ‘ the way i would put that is this , if you 've got a young lad at school and he 's being bullied , and he comes out of school at the end of the day and the bully is waiting for him , to give him a good hiding … the bully may be bigger than him , but he has a choice			0
‘ he can either cower down and take his beating , or he can stand and fight , and hope to maybe land a few punches			0
but his victory is in the struggle itself			0
‘ we stood and fought against enormous odds , and not just for the pits – for our way of life			0
’ for many , the miners ' strike is the defining moment of @entity61 ’s prime ministership , with many mining communities reacting with glee to the former @entity294 leader ’s death last year			2
mr @entity100 spoke of his village ’s celebration at her passing , saying he did not care that it offended some people			0
‘ what an epitaph she has in these mining communities : death , a lot of people have committed suicide , and no hope			0
all down to her , and some of her spawn that 's about now , ’ he said			0
20 striking miners were arrested when they attacked miners returning to work at the @entity231 , near @entity232 , @entity25 @entity19 taxi driver @entity310 , pictured left with his daughter , was killed after a breeze block was thrown at his vehicle form an overhead bridge , while he was driving a working miner to @entity316			1
