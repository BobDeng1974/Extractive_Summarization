@entity0 runs you through what we 've learned this weekend , from @entity5 's new deeper role for @entity6 , to the telepathic partnership between @entity8 and @entity9 at @entity10 while @entity12 ’s bright cameo against @entity13 may be a sign of better things to come from the @entity17 star			1
elsewhere , @entity18 is quietly rediscovering his form at @entity20 while @entity21 is making great strides as manager of @entity24			0
moving @entity5 into a back three has made a major difference for @entity6 as he gets the scope to start attacks from deep			0
the 20 - year - old , originally signed from @entity29 for nearly £ 10million as a midfielder , frequently stepped forward from the back at @entity32			1
with the confidence of two other centre backs to protect him he found a team - mate with 47 of his 51 passes			2
@entity5 ( left ) was deployed in a defensive role by @entity38 against @entity32 2			2
@entity8 must love working alongside @entity9 – @entity10 ’s @entity40 playmaker supplied the striker with 10 passes during the 78 minutes both were on the pitch against @entity45 , including the brilliant backheel that set up @entity8 ’s 15th goal of the season			1
no other @entity10 player gave @entity8 the ball so many times – but the partnership is a bit of a one - way affair			1
@entity8 found @entity9 just once			2
@entity9 celebrates giving @entity10 the lead in their @entity57 game against @entity45 on saturday @entity8 added a second for @entity10 just before the hour mark against the @entity60 @entity8 and @entity9 forged a devastating partnership during @entity10 's 2 - 0 victory against @entity45 3			1
it ca n’t help @entity64 in their quest for a first away point of a troubled season on the road that they are continually out worked by @entity70 be fair to @entity71 , he covered 7.2 miles at @entity72 , but next best in terms of distance run was the 6.5 miles of centre half @entity75			0
@entity80 ’s side , for whom the ever energetic @entity77 inevitably went furthest with 8.0 miles , had six players in all who beat @entity75 ’s total			2
@entity64 centre half @entity75 ( left ) covered 6.5 miles at @entity85 , but six @entity72 players eclipsed his total 4			0
@entity88 will be hoping @entity12 ’s bright cameo display against @entity13 proves he ’s benefited from the enforced rest caused by knee ligament problems that have kept him out since october			0
the @entity17 @entity94 winner got on the ball 22 times in a busy 17 minutes after replacing @entity97 and gave it away only twice			0
@entity12 was full of energy during his 17 - minute cameo as @entity101 cruised to a 3 - 0 victory against @entity13 5			2
@entity103 might be the only man at @entity104 delighted to see the back of @entity106 as the @entity108 striker disappears first to the @entity109 and then to @entity110			1
the 26 - year - old @entity112 striker has started just three games in nearly a year since moving to the @entity114 and his handful of appearances off the bench total just 143 minutes			1
he ’s capable of more though – his arrival as a sub against @entity120 saw him create the @entity122 equaliser which the dubious goals committee will award either to @entity124 or as a @entity126 own goal			0
@entity104 's @entity103 ( left ) skips past the tackle of @entity120 defender @entity128 6			1
@entity129 could be the big winner from the arrival of @entity132 as the new manager at @entity134			0
the @entity136 midfield enforcer was always one of the first names on the team sheet when @entity139 was in charge , but had started only once in the @entity57 all season before @entity132 put him into the team against @entity143			0
the 27 - year - old made a difference , only giving the ball away four times as his ability to protect the defence saw @entity134 keep a clean sheet in a home @entity57 game for only the third time all season			1
@entity129 ( left ) looks set to benefit from the arrival of @entity132 as the new manager of the @entity134 7			0
@entity18 is quietly rediscovering the form that when he was at @entity6 earned him a solitary @entity159 cap			0
at 24 the @entity20 defender is benefiting from playing regular @entity57 football for the first time since his breakthrough season at @entity164 in 2010 - 11			0
switched to left back against @entity165 from his more natural role on the right , he snuffed out the threat of @entity169 – winning every one of his six tackles			2
@entity18 ( right ) is beginning to rediscover the form that earned him a solitary @entity159 cap in 2012 8			0
@entity165 youngster @entity173 will be watching the breakthroughs made by @entity175 and @entity176 at @entity177 while he spends the season on loan at @entity180			1
the 21 - year - old , among the nominations for @entity184 player of the year when he spent the last campaign with @entity186 , has looked equally assured in the @entity187 and gave another outstanding display in the 1 - 0 win over @entity190 that kept @entity192 ’s side in the play - off places			1
attacking midfielder @entity173 has played just seven minutes in the @entity57 for @entity165 , but @entity196 ’s fondness for promoting homegrown kids might offer him fresh chances when his loan is over in the summer			1
@entity165 youngster @entity173 has been outstanding for @entity180 during his loan spell at the club 9			1
@entity202 had been gaining a solid reputation in management in the lower leagues until he went to @entity206 and everything went wrong			0
some 18 months later he ’s taken charge of @entity209 in @entity184 on an interim basis while @entity211 undergoes heart surgery			0
there are promising signs that @entity202 can rebuild his career – the 2 - 2 draw with high - flying @entity217 made it two games without defeat for a side that had lost three in a row before @entity223 took charge			1
@entity21 ’s first venture into being a boss in @entity159 has started well – a 2 - 1 win over @entity228 moved his @entity24 side into second place in @entity231 with 20 points from the nine games since he took over			1
the former @entity10 star is encouraging attacking play from all over his team – when right back @entity238 got the second goal he became the 15th player to score for the @entity241 this season			2
@entity24 have gained 20 points from their last nine games since @entity21 took over as boss			0

@entity9 and @entity8 *combined* brilliantly against @entity45
the @entity40 playmaker supplied @entity8 with 10 passes during the game
both players scored in @entity10 's 2 - 0 defeat of the @entity60
@entity103 may benefit from @entity106 's departure from @entity104
the 26 - year - old @entity112 striker has started just three games in nearly a year
@entity165 youngster @entity173 is impressing on loan at @entity180
