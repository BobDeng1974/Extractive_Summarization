by @entity0 published : 11:09 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 12:22 est , 9 may 2013 the daughter of an an 83 - year - old woman who went missing from @entity3 last week , and whose body was later found in the @entity5 , says if she had turned around her grandmother might still be alive			1
' i ’m devastated , ' @entity7 said to the @entity9			2
' i ’m just torn to pieces by the stupidity			2
it could have been avoided			2
the way she died , no one deserves to die like that			2
' @entity16 , 83 , had made the return trip to @entity18 at least 10 times before but when she got off @entity20 1094 last friday at @entity3 she was in a state of confusion			1
disappearance : surveillance footage shows @entity16 , 83 , as she walks through the terminal after arriving at @entity3 around 4pm on may 3 found : sniffer dogs were used to track @entity16 whose body was found within sight of the airport perimeter at @entity3 in @entity31 tragic : mrs @entity33 's body was found a short distance from the airport , in the @entity5 mrs @entity33 , who suffers from dementia , walked past an @entity20 representative her family had sent to meet her at the gate as she off the plane , and then walked past her own daughter and granddaughter who were waiting downstairs			1
surveillance video shows mrs @entity33 walked through baggage claim while daughter @entity7 , was facing in a different direction			1
by 4:12 p.m. , the family said , video showed @entity16 leaving through a door , never to return			1
searchers , volunteers and mrs @entity33 's family spent the weekend combing the area around the airport			1
missed connections : it seems a series of chance errors led to grandmother @entity16 ( pictured ) walking out of the airport and ultimately to her death her body was found on monday huddled in a heavily wooded area , in a park just up the road from the airport terminal			1
her daughter said mrs @entity33 had been showing some early signs of dementia and that they were worried about her safety			1
she had been experiencing memory loss and confusion since her husband died last year but had never wandered off before			2
@entity16 ’s family had arranged for wheelchair service with @entity20 and an agent helped @entity16 get to her flight			1
relatives have said that they requested for the airline to escort mrs kong both to and from her seat , but @entity80 said the family only requested service to the gate			2
upon arriving in @entity31 , mrs @entity33 never made contact with the escort from the airline who duty it was to wheel her down to baggage claim			1
the family can only assume that she either did n't see the sign or was confused about who was picking her up			2
one level below in the arrivals area , her daughter @entity7 , had no idea what was going on			1
she was excited to see her mother and had bought her a new cardigan to keep her warm			1
the family had recently renovated the house and added handrails in the shower so she could get around easier			0
reservations had been made for @entity106 lunch			0
looking over the surveillance video , authorities said that she was not visibly in distress or disoriented			0
she is seen talking with people and sitting calmly on a bench			0
in the meantime , her daughter was still patiently waiting			1
luggage from the flight began to arrive along with other wheelchair passengers			0
after a little while longer she began to grow concerned			0
she had mother paged and even asked at the ticket desk			2
nobody seemed to know anything			0
one employee told her that mrs @entity33 was still by the gate whilst another said that she was in the bathroom			0
ms @entity7 called @entity80 's 800 number			0
' please help me find my mom , ' she begged			0
' i ’m screaming mad right now			0
' an hour and a half later , she approached the airport police			2
confusion : mrs @entity33 's family had been waiting to collect her in the baggage claim area of the @entity31 airport but she never appeared concerns : mrs @entity33 's family said that she was suffering from early signs of dementia alone : mrs @entity16 was supposed to be escorted off the @entity20 flight by wheelchair but appears to have wandered off it marked the start of a three day search for @entity16 that involved a boat , dogs , a helicopter , volunteers and cctv video of several different parts of the airport			1
at the weekend , tracking dogs , who had sniffed @entity16 ’s luggage manage to follow her scent to a wooded area about 200 yards from the airport perimeter			1
the area where she was found is just off the walking path where it drops off at a steep angle into an area of growth and leaves			1
she was still long flower - print dress she wore on the flight			0
she had her purse , and there were no signs of foul play			0
@entity167 are waiting for an official cause of death , but relatives said that it appears @entity16 died from the chilly weather			1
her family are devastated but are now planning her funeral			0
her granddaughter @entity174 still has the cardigan she was going to give to her grandma			0
her death has left family members and friends in the @entity80 and @entity18 in shock , she said			0
' in @entity18 , the house is full of people reading the news ... they ’re just devastated ' @entity174 said			0
' we only anticipated she would be a little slower but would still be grandma			0
