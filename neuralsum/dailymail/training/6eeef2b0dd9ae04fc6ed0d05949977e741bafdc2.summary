furious visitors to the new £ 27million @entity2 visitor centre have criticised @entity3 for ‘ chaotic scenes ’ as the site struggles to cope with the crowds			1
tourists have slammed the centre – which opened three weeks ago – on travel website @entity10 , with positive reviews plummeting by almost half			1
most of the criticism centred on the transportation from the centre to the stones			1
visitors have moaned about queuing for more than an hour to board a ‘ land train ’ – three carriages pulled by a @entity20 – which carries 45 people and takes ten minutes to travel to the stones			1
visitors say the system is a ‘ farce ’ and have asked how the centre will cope when thousands a day visit during the summer			0
one reviewer , @entity36 , from @entity37 , said : ‘ there are two @entity20 towing some wagons and some mini-buses that mysteriously are stopped half of the time			1
‘ people were getting angry after one and a half hours of queuing			2
’ others told @entity3 to ‘ learn from @entity45 ’ on how to manage crowds , while more slated the price rise for adult tickets from £ 8 to £ 14.95			1
one volunteer , who declined to be named , added : ‘ when it ’s windy or raining , those in the ticket office ca n’t open the windows to serve people because the rain blows in – it ’s been built facing the wrong direction			0
’ @entity3 asked tourists to be patient while it solved the problems			1
previously , @entity2 enjoyed four - or five - star reviews from 75 per cent of visitors on ratings website @entity10 , despite politicians branding the 1960s visitors centre ' a national disgrace '			1
but in just 21 days , positive reviews have plummeted to 46 per cent			2
negative reviews , giving the site a one - star rating , have jumped from eight per cent to a third			0
delays : visitors waited for an hour - and - a - half for a shuttle bus to take 45 people at a time to the stones even those giving @entity2 a good overall score complaining of the chaos surrounding accessing the stones			1
a section of the @entity78 road , which runs past @entity2 , was permanently closed in june during the construction of the visitor building			0
the centre , designed by architects @entity82 , lies a mile - and - a - half to the west of the stones			1
@entity3 has admitted there have been ' some issues ' and asked tourists to be patient while they solve the problems			1
one reviewer , ‘ @entity36 ’ , from @entity37 , said : ' there are two @entity20 towing some wagons and some mini-buses that mysteriously are stopped half of the time			2
' people were getting angry after one and a half hours of queuing			2
' others told @entity3 to ‘ learn from @entity45 ’ on how to manage crowds , while more slated the price rise for tickets from around £ 8 to £ 14.95 for an adult			1
conflict : the centre had already come under fire from @entity104 for exhibiting the skeleton of a @entity107 man rather than burying him staff and volunteers have also spoken of their frustrations at the new system			0
one volunteer , who declined to be named , said it was immediately obvious the centre would not be able to cope with the numbers of people visiting			0
he said : ' the problem is the transport , getting people to and from the stones			2
' they have abandoned the idea of only using the @entity123 , we ’ve got coaches now , which kind of defeats the object			0
' also , when it ’s windy or raining , those in the ticket office ca n’t open the windows to serve people because the rain blows in , it ’s been built facing the wrong direction			0
' @entity134 , @entity2 ’s general manager , yesterday played down the fiercely negative reviews of the new centre , and asked people to be patient			0
she said : ' there has been huge interest in @entity2 since the new visitor centre opened towards the end of december			0
' on one day alone we welcomed 5,000 visitors which is along the same levels as during our peak summer season			0
' this is a brand new operation , on a completely different scale to the old visitor centre , and naturally during these early days , there have been some issues			0
' but we are solving them , we have increased our shuttle service taking people to the stones and from 1 february , our timed ticketing system will swing into place			2
' the majority of feedback has been overwhelmingly positive ; visitors have been fascinated by our new exhibition and love the sense that the stones are now reconnected with the wider landscape			2
' we appreciate all the feedback we ’ve received and we would ask people to be patient while we iron out the few remaining issues			0

good ratings on @entity10 plummeted by half in just three weeks
most complaints centred around *failure* to get to stones themselves
@entity3 put problems down to ' *teething* problems '
