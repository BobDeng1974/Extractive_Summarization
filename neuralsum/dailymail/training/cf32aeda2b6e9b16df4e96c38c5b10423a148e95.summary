by @entity0 published : 06:55 est , 1 august 2012 updated : 18:20 est , 1 august 2012 a judge yesterday warned of the ‘ utterly destructive ’ effects of drug abuse on families after hearing how billionaire @entity5 hid his dead wife ’s body for more than two months			1
judge @entity8 said the @entity10 heir had enjoyed ‘ every material advantage imaginable ’ before throwing it all away on addiction to hard drugs and descending into a life of squalor			2
after @entity5 ’s wife @entity17 died , he kept her decomposing corpse under a pile of bin bags , bed sheets and clothing several feet deep inside a locked annexe in the couple ’s £ 70million @entity25 mansion , where they lived as virtual recluses			1
' breakdown ' : @entity5 was convicted today at @entity28 of preventing his wife 's burial and driving under the influence of drugs he acted with ‘ deceit and deliberation ’ to prolong the concealment of the mother of his four children , using deodorant to try to disguise the stench and telling people that she was on a trip to @entity43 , @entity28 was told			1
but he escaped jail after the court heard that @entity5 ’s drug abuse meant he had been unable to confront the reality of his ‘ beloved ’ wife ’s death			1
the 49 - year - old , whose family is the 12th richest in @entity53 and whose fortune comes from the £ 4.5billion @entity10 drinks carton empire , told psychiatrists after his arrest : ‘ i know it is sad and selfish , but i just did n’t want her to leave			2
’ he cut a tragic figure as he stood in the dock to plead guilty to the common law offence of failing to prevent his 48 - year - old wife ’s lawful and decent burial			1
dressed in a navy blue blazer and red tie , he repeatedly blinked and twitched as judge @entity8 gave him a ten - month suspended sentence on the condition that he agreed to a ‘ very demanding ’ drug rehabilitation programme			1
' decomposing ' : @entity5 kept the body of his wife @entity17 , right , under a makeshift rug of clothes and bin bags the judge told @entity5 : ‘ if ever there was an illustration of the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families , it is to be found in the facts of this case			1
‘ you and your wife had every material advantage imaginable , and for a time a happy family life			2
your relapse into the misuse of drugs , together with that of your wife , destroyed all that			2
‘ it is graphically illustrated by the contrast between the rooms visitors saw , and the utter squalor of the rooms you really lived in			0
’ glamorous lifestyle : police outside the @entity106 ' @entity105 mansion in @entity25 , where @entity17 was found dead inner demons : @entity108 , pictured as a teenager , , fought a lifelong battle with addiction alongside her husband the court heard that mrs @entity108 was last seen alive on may 3 when she met her financial adviser and confided that she was ‘ worried ’ about her husband ’s ‘ chaotic lifestyle ’			1
four days later her husband found her dead on the second floor ‘ annexe ’ of their central @entity105 mansion , which only the couple were allowed to enter			1
unable to cope with his loss , he hid her body for more than two months until july 9 , when he was stopped by police after driving erratically through morning rush hour traffic in @entity127 , @entity105			1
police who searched his car found a crack pipe , cannabis and white powder in the footwell of his @entity134 and noticed his pupils were dilated and he was unsteady on his feet			0
they also discovered some unopened letters to mrs @entity108 in the boot of the car			1
when asked about the letters , @entity5 ‘ welled up ’ and claimed she had gone to @entity141 two weeks earlier			2
police became suspicious and went to search the home and were let in by staff			0
@entity145 , prosecuting , said : ‘ they were hesitant to allow access to the second floor because part of the premises was an annexe which for some years access had not been allowed to anyone other than mr @entity5 and his wife			1
‘ they decided to force entry but when they were in a lift they noticed the stench of decomposition			0
they entered a room which had been sealed off with locks and gaffer - tape			0
’ the untidy room contained a pile of clothes and other linen on the floor concealing a body in ‘ an advanced stage of decomposition ’			1
post-mortem tests indicated mrs @entity108 probably died on may 7			1
@entity108 ’s parents were in the room as police made the horrifying discovery of their daughter ’s body , the court was told			2
@entity0 and @entity180 are understood to have rushed to the @entity182 home after seeing police cars parked outside as officers searched inside			0
judge @entity185 said @entity5 ’s prolonged concealment of his wife ’s body had already caused ‘ great concern ’ among those anxious about her whereabouts			1
he said this was compounded by the ‘ dreadful shock of discovery ’ in distressing circumstances ‘ for those who had to uncover the body but especially for your wife ’s parents who were in the room when their daughter ’s body was discovered ’			2
after his arrest , @entity5 was transferred to the private @entity206 psychiatric hospital in @entity207 were he later told police in a statement : ‘ i fully understand that my beloved wife of 19 years is dead and i am devastated , particularly for my children , by her death			1
‘ i do not have a coherent recollection of events leading up to and since @entity17 ’s death save to say i have never wished upon her or done her any harm			0
i did not supply her with drugs			0
‘ i do n’t know what caused her death , i did not feel able to fully confront the reality of her death			0
‘ with the benefit of hindsight i did not act rationally			0
i tried to carry on as if her death had not happened , and batted away any enquiries about her			0
i also took measures to reduce the smell			0
‘ i believe in the period since @entity17 ’s death i have suffered some sort of breakdown			0
’ tests after his arrest showed that @entity5 had cocaine , morphine , diazepam , tamazepam and nitrazopam in his body			2
@entity238 , @entity239 , who is @entity240 ’s brother , said in mitigation that @entity5 had no recollection at all about the first ten to 12 hours after his wife ’s death			1
he said : ‘ he did n’t move the body , he described her as appearing quite restful			0
‘ he felt quite unable to face up to the fact that @entity17 had died and almost like a small child could n’t face up to telling anyone else and so took steps to delay the moment of facing up to reality			2
in his own words , he acted in a cowardly fashion			0
’ cocaine , opiates and amphetamines were found in the body of mrs @entity108 , who had an ongoing heart problem and had been fitted with a pacemaker , the court heard			1
tragic : the judge said the case illustrated the utterly destructive effects of drug misuse on individuals and their families drug problems : @entity5 , 49 , has been ordered to live at @entity206 psychiatric hospital in @entity207 , pictured , for two years the judge said he accepted that she died of heart failure coupled with the effects of drugs , telling @entity5 : ‘ there is no evidence to suggest the involvement of anyone else , including you , in her death			1
’ @entity5 also admitted driving under the influence of drugs , for which he was given a two - month sentence suspended for two years			1
his family made their billions through the @entity10 empire , which was founded in 1944			0
the @entity285 exited the @entity286 in 1995 and waived all interests in the company at the time			0
a single glass of champagne to toast the new millennium sent @entity5 and @entity108 spiralling back into a devastating addiction that was to cost them everything			1
the couple had both struggled with drug abuse in their youth but had successfully fought it to form a ‘ loving ’ family before the fateful decision to raise a glass together at midnight on @entity304 in 1999 , the court heard			1
@entity238 , @entity239 , for @entity5 , said his battle with addiction appeared to have started with his extraordinarily wealthy background as the heir to the £ 4.5billion @entity10 drinks carton empire			1
he said : ‘ despite or perhaps because of the economic circumstances of his upbringing the defendant had unusually strong social anxiety , feelings of inferiority , tendencies to medicate by drug taking and he dealt with emotional conflict by denial			0
’ adoring : the couple met in rehab in 1989 before marrying three years later			0
they spent many spells in rehab but also lived drug - free for a period he became addicted to drugs while travelling in his early twenties and met his wife - to - be in rehab in 1989 , when he was 26 and she was 25			1
they married three years later and , with mrs @entity108 taking the lead , they managed to live drug - free for 11 years as they raised four children			1
mr @entity240 said : ‘ they plainly adored each other , they were a loving family and they were extremely down to earth people and nice to work for , their staff said			0
’ they were active philanthropists , with a charitable trust created by the couple giving away £ 2million to good causes every year since 1995			0
the family also enjoyed an affluent lifestyle , spending much of their time in their 11 - bedroom mansion in @entity352			0
but mr @entity240 said : ‘ things started to go wrong around about the millennium when the total abstinence of rehab process was mildly loosened by @entity17 ’s urge to have a glass of champagne on @entity304 of 1999 to 2000			2
‘ needless to say they both did and the addiction slowly and surely began to take hold again			0
’ they lost the support of groups helping them to stay clean , and descended back into drug dependency			2
they struggled on until 2007 when another devastating blow to the family occurred			0
details were not given in court , but it was described as ‘ like the @entity371 ’ to @entity5			2
mr @entity240 said : ‘ from that moment on he has been effectively a recluse			0
’ he said @entity5 spoke only to his wife as the pair barricaded themselves into the second floor ‘ annexe ’ of their 50 - room @entity25 mansion and banned anyone from entering			1
mr @entity240 said : ‘ they were deeply ashamed by their situation and the thought of meeting people and explaining their situation was too much to bear			0
’ he added : ‘ the reaction of @entity108 ’s parents has been laudably understanding , forgiving and supportive			2
‘ @entity391 [ her father ] described the defendant as a wonderful father , a wonderful man , a very good person , but also very ill. ’			0
