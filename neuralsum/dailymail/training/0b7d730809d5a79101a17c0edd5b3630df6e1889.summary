by @entity0 after the wettest january for more than 100 years , we 're all desperately looking forward to any sign that spring is on its way			1
one of the earliest heralds is the snowdrop			1
and since the beginning of february , gardeners with land not swamped by floodwater will have been looking out for the first shoots nervously peeping their heads above soil			1
but gardeners have another reason to feel protective and anxious about their flowers this year			1
@entity16 collecting has seen a boom in @entity18 over the last few years , with sales reaching many hundreds of pounds for just one bulb			1
flower power : @entity22 is spending £ 1,000 to protect his snowdrops the most expensive is a variety called @entity16 @entity25 : just one bulb went for £ 725 last february			1
clearly , this is not a poor man ’s hobby - and that 's the problem			1
thieves have seized upon the desirability of some of the rarest bulbs and are stealing them from verges , private gardens and public parks in worrying numbers			1
now , the gardeners are fighting back with a range of measures to try to deter even the most determined thief			1
some are even installing anti-theft devices worth thousands of pounds to protect their precious plants			1
no one can deny snowdrops are beautiful			1
on a walk in the pouring rain through sir @entity51 near @entity53 in @entity54 , they take your breath away			1
carpets of them grow in the @entity59 , yet only two are labelled			1
this is deliberate , says head gardener , @entity62			1
back in 2008 , she planted out two pots of @entity64 , a rare variety that then cost £ 25 per bulb			1
' both clumps went missing			1
one day they were just gone , ' she says			1
' but the problems really started in the winter of 2011/12			1
we planted out a few rather rare snowdrops from a private collection and within a few weeks we noticed that some had gone missing			1
' we got some more and we ’ve planted them in subterranean cages so you ca n’t just dig them up			1
we do that with all our rare varieties now and we do n’t label them			1
' expensive : @entity16 @entity25 is worth £ 725 a bulb the gardens have 60 of the world ’s 2,000 varieties of snowdrop in a 180 - acre site			1
over the past two years , however , to stop thieves stealing the rarer plants they have been removed from the grounds and rehoused in pots in locked greenhouses			1
the public 's only glimpse of them is at an annual , two - week snowdrop exhibition in the main house			2
this spring some 40 varieties are on view to snowdrop enthusiasts - known as galanthophiles - from the diminutive @entity102 to the foot - tall mrs @entity103 , named after the wife of @entity106 's former head gardener			2
two wardens patrol the room at all times to enforce a strict ' no touching ' rule			2
plants can be inspected only with the use of mirrors , which are provided			2
so far , fingers crossed , nothing has been taken			2
' i think it 's very sad , ' says warden @entity118			2
' they would all look beautiful in their natural habitat			2
they make you think that spring is on its way			2
' but this simply is n't possible : after the exhibition , which ends this sunday , the rare varieties are returned to their greenhouses , the doors locked and alarms set			2
' it 's just awful , ' says @entity62			2
' it 's very disappointing that this has happened and that we have to protect plants in this manner			2
' i can understand that the bulbs are expensive , but you can just buy the cheap ones			1
you do n’t have to buy the expensive ones			2
it ’s like a mania for people			2
' ' @entity22 owns , grows and maintains the @entity147 of snowdrops in his back garden in a hidden corner of @entity151			2
here , over the last ten years , he has amassed the largest collection in the world , numbering some 900 varieties			2
' it looks wonderful at the moment , ' he says			2
' there are snowdrops flowering everywhere			2
' but only @entity22 , his wife and perhaps a few select friends will see his stunning spring display this year			2
the reason is that @entity22 , too , has fallen prey to a snowdrop thief over the last two years			0
' we usually make the gardens available for people to visit , to open up the collection , ' he explains			0
' we got lots of visitors the first time we opened in 2012			0
people brought cameras and took lots of pictures			0
clearly , they marked where things were and came back under cover of darkness			0
' a few weeks after @entity22 ’s open day he discovered that a variety named @entity182 , which was only discovered in 2004 and was consequently very rare , had been dug up			0
sparse : bulbs are disappearing from roadsides and parks too ' it was a particularly valuable variety , ' he says			1
' that theft alone cost me £ 900			1
it 's not about the money ; you do n't look at your garden in terms of monetary value			0
but it did make me sad			0
' last year , the same thing happened			0
he held an open day , and a few weeks ' later discovered another two valuable varieties had been stolen			0
' they just walked in the front gate when i was in bed and took them , ' he says			0
' i do n't know who 's doing it , but it suggests it 's being done by people who know their snowdrops			0
' @entity22 did n't report either theft to the police , but this year his prized garden is closed to the public while he installs security measures to protect his plants			0
four cctv cameras and night - time anti-theft lights are being put in at the cost of £ 1,000			1
' it 's quite annoying , but i have to keep them safe , ' he says			0
@entity222 , proprietor of @entity223 in @entity224 , is known as @entity225 and sells them across @entity227			0
the rarest do not have a price			1
he simply accepts bids for them			0
this is his busiest period of the year , often working until 1am to package and send out plants ' in the green ' ( snowdrops are traditionally sold in leaf as they tend to not prosper as well when planted as bulbs )			1
' i think it 's someone who ’s doing this to stock their own garden , ' he says			0
the plants are so rare no one has them for sale			0
' the thief keeps incredibly good records of what 's growing where			0
they know what 's in each pot and where it is , ' he adds			0
so far , he 's not had any thefts , but is cautious about revealing the location of his nursery , where , he says , there are ‘ people patrolling the whole time ’ to protect the bulbs			1
beautiful sight : but many displays are being ruined thanks to thieves when attending special snowdrop events , he employs security staff to protect his wares			1
' now the ' mania ' for snowdrops seems to be spreading beyond the inner circle of galanthophiles to the general public			0
@entity277 is head gardener at @entity278 on the outskirts of @entity280			0
the gardens have drifts of snowdrops in woodland and attract up to 55,000 visitors per year			0
they have experienced so many thefts - not just of snowdrops - that they have now installed a 600m - long , 2m - high metal security fence , costing £ 25,000			1
' it was necessary to do it , ' says @entity277 , ' otherwise people could just have hopped over a four - foot wall into our snowdrop area and taken them			0
' and it 's not just public gardens that are being targeted			0
online gardening forums are abuzz with people lamenting thefts from their flowerbeds			0
such is the paranoia that all of them hide behind pseudonyms and refuse to speak publicly about their losses , for fear of being hit again			0
bulbs are disappearing from roadsides and parks too			1
on march 22 last year , @entity312 wrote to her local newspaper , the @entity313 , saying that snowdrops had been stolen from @entity316 recreation ground in @entity317			0
' it has upset me greatly , ' she said			0
' i , and no doubt countless others , have enjoyed for many years the snowdrops that come up and flower for weeks , and grow when nothing else is able to			0
' back at @entity51 , i walk back to my car through the @entity325			0
under a hornbeam tree there is a vast carpet of purple cyclamen and snowdrops			0
it is a beautiful sight			0
it ’s hard to imagine who would want to spoil that by stealing some of the plants			0
but somewhere , someone is planning their next heist			0
this year , however , the gardeners are ready for them .			1
