if mankind does ever become embroiled in a terminator - style ' war against the machines ' , we 're really going to have to start doing a few more press - ups			2
researchers have developed a robotic muscle , an incredible thousand times more powerful than that of a human and capable of hurling an object 50 times heavier than itself			0
the breakthrough relies on a material called vanadium dioxide which has a unique ability to change its size , shape and structure when heated			1
the vanadium muscle is capable of catapulting extremely heavy objects over five times its own length in just 60 milliseconds			2
but there 's no need to worry about hoards of herculean robots rising up and taking over the world just yet , the proto - type robo muscle is only micro-sized			2
study leader , @entity42 told nanowerk.com ' we 've created a micro-bimorph dual coil that functions as a powerful torsional muscle , driven thermally or electro - thermally by the phase transition of vanadium dioxide			1
outclassed : even the likes of olympic gold medalist @entity50 ca n't compete with the awesome power of the robotic muscle ' using a simple design and inorganic materials , we achieve superior performance in power density and speed over the motors and actuators now used in integrated micro-systems			0
' what makes vanadium dioxide so unique is that it is an insulator at low temperatures but becomes a conductor when it hits @entity67 , a bit like plastic transforming into metal			1
the scientists hope that this remarkable ability can be harnessed to create far more energy efficient electronic and optical devices			1
when heated , vanadium dioxide crystals change their structural form rapidly , both contracting and expanding at the same time			1
it is this particular trait that the researchers have harnessed to create the robo - muscle			1
dr @entity42 explains : ' multiple micro-muscles can be assembled into a micro-robotic system that simulates an active neuromuscular system			0
' the naturally combined functions of proximity sensing and torsional motion allow the device to remotely detect a target and respond by reconfiguring itself to a different shape			0
' this simulates living bodies where neurons sense and deliver stimuli to the muscles and the muscles provide motion			0
' with its combination of power and multi-functionality , our micro-muscle shows great potential for applications that require a high level of functionality integration in a small space			0

breakthrough made by team at @entity27
robo - muscle is made of a unique material called vanadium dioxide
it has a unique ability to change its size , shape and structure when heated
works as an insulator at low temperatures but becomes a conductor at @entity67
could pave the way to create more efficient electronic and optical devices
