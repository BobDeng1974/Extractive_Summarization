wellness warrior @entity0 sensationally admitted yesterday in a tell - all interview that she had made up her terminal brain cancer diagnosis			1
the 23 - year - old founder of the @entity5 app came clean about her circumstances , telling the @entity7 , ' none of it 's true '			1
in the interview , @entity10 asked her former fans and customers who purchased her app and books to see her as only ' human '			1
leading psychologist @entity16 told @entity17 that this is a common reaction from people who are suffering from anti-social personality and narcissism disorders			1
lack of remorse is a common trait seen in those with anti-social personalities , @entity16 says			1
' a lack of remorse definitely fits in			2
it 's like - you do what you need to do to get what you want , ' she said			2
' so if they need money they will commit fraudulent acts and steal , for example			2
' while other experts suggested to @entity7 that she could be suffering @entity48 , @entity16 believes this is n't likely to be the case for @entity10			1
changing times : ' in the past , a need for that love and attention may have been in less dangerous ways ... but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand , ' says @entity16 ' with @entity48 , they normally do n’t just lie , they go much further to be sick			1
' while they definitely fake illness , they also self - harm and do n’t normally do it for money purposes , they do it for attention , ' she said			0
' for example , they will go to lots of different doctors and shop around until someone believes their symptoms			2
they also might drink poison or swallow things or stab themselves , then ask , " what ’s wrong with me ? '' ' so i think in this particular case , she ’s made up a story for fame , fortune , signing book deals - which suggests more narcissism and anti-socialism , ' added @entity16			1
another common trait shared by narcissists is that sufferers are often very charismatic			0
' a lack or remorse definitely fits in ... you do want you need to do to get what you want ' : leading psychologist @entity16 says that @entity10 's actions point to both a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder ' narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity , wanting fame and fortune			1
they love to believe they are special and need all this admiration and attention , ' the psychologist said			2
@entity16 says this can often be a sign of neglect			2
this fits with @entity10 's account of a troubled childhood - she was quoted in the women 's weekly saying she had to bring herself up - doing the dishes and cooking her own food from a very young age , for example			2
according to @entity16 , the common signs of someone showing an anti-social personality disorder are ... 1			1
they deceive and lie 2			0
they can be impulsive and irresponsible 4			0
they do n’t respect the law 5			0
they do n’t mind if they hurt family and friends , anyone is open to being deceived 6			0
they are very charming and charismatic 7			0
they have a certain attractiveness and draw people in 8			0
they show a real interest in people 9			0
passionate about things ' neglect can lead someone to develop really unhealthy strategies to seek the love and attention they missed out on , ' says @entity16			2
' in the past , a need for love and attention may have emerged in less dangerous ways - a lie here , a lie there - but now technology has allowed it to get completely out of hand			2
' social media has become the perfect way to gain that , we know anyone is thrilled when they get new followers - let alone hero worship , worldwide fans and book deals , ' she said			1
' i worry about future generations with things like @entity167 , @entity168 , @entity169 and people constantly needing excessive praise			0
' @entity16 says our social media culture is fuelling unhealthy expectations for young girls but also a way of accessing information that could be misleading			1
' everyone laughs about dr @entity178 and how if you have some condition you should see an expert but that goes for all these self styled gurus in anything			0
' we might want to buy into a story , it 's very appealing for people to love somebody who can turn something around and survive and particularly so if they are very marketable but any idolisation of someone is n't healthy			0
' with massive followings and a glamorous story , young minds will follow that and believe it			0
our poor doctors must have people coming in every day and people saying this is what i 'm doing and why			0
let ’s look at the science , ' she said			0
' they love to believe they are special ' : ' narcissistic people will lie and build themselves up to be an amazing person full of grandiosity , wanting fame and fortune , says psychologist @entity16 ( pictured left )			1
she believes @entity0 ( pictured right ) may suffer from a narcissism disorder and anti-social personality disorder			1
@entity16 also believes that @entity10 could struggle to change without help			1
' she might change her name and come up with some other scheme unless she shows genuine remorse , seeks help , and develops some insight			0
with what she is displaying , the prognosis is quite poor			0
' according to the interview , @entity10 's new management will be organising for a psychologist to see her .			1

wellness guru and app developer @entity0 lied about having cancer
' no , none of it is true , ' she told @entity7
' i am still *jumping* between what i think i know and what is reality ' , she said
leading psychologist believes @entity10 could be suffering from both anti-social *behaviour* and narcissism disorders
@entity16 says the wide *adoption* of technology and social media mean that small lies can easily get out of hand
