by @entity0 the @entity1 is imposing emergency speed limits on pothole - riddled roads rather than repairing them			1
temporary speed limit signs have appeared alongside miles of badly damaged carriageway			1
in some places signs and bollards have been there for weeks , but there is no evidence of repair work taking place			2
damage : some roads have had their speed limits reduced to limit the impact of potholes ( file photo ) the @entity19 alerted its patrols to the trend last week after it emerged that miles of the @entity22 in @entity23 have been subject to a reduced speed limit because of surface damage			1
a @entity19 spokesman said : ‘ this is a first from our point of view			1
we need to get it stopped			2
’ last summer , the @entity1 , which is responsible for motorways and trunk roads , introduced ‘ less prescriptive ’ road maintenance contracts			2
responsibility for maintaining major roads is split into 14 areas managed by private firms , and their contracts allow more flexibility in dealing with repairs			0
but it is feared the move will lead to a lower quality of road maintenance			0
shadow transport minister @entity44 said : ‘ reduced speed limits add to congestion and to the frustration of the motoring public , who want to see the roads in a decent state of repair			2
’ slow : the measure means it is not necessary to repair damaged roads ( file photo ) the harsh winter is blamed for causing roads to become especially damaged this year			1
at the same time , @entity58 departments have been ordered to make cut - backs			0
the @entity1 said last night it had invested £ 420 million in road improvements last year			0
a spokesman added : ‘ we have always carried out repairs where they are most needed and we will continue to do this			0
’ @entity67 ’s councils , who look after smaller roads , are facing a £ 10.5 billion backlog of pothole repairs after a harsh winter			1
local authorities warn that road networks could be ‘ brought to their knees ’ by more bad weather			0
other roads with stretches subject to long - term restrictions include the westbound @entity80 in @entity23 between @entity81 and @entity82 and the @entity83 south between @entity84 and @entity85 in @entity86 .			0
