it is widely used by patients to seek diagnoses , research drugs and find out details about doctors			1
however , the notion of a medic using @entity8 to research a patient is considered a breach of trust			2
but now , the authors of a new medical paper have claimed that doctors should , in some cases , be able to use the popular internet search engine to seek information on the people they are caring for			1
the reason ? because sometimes it is necessary to protect patients - and others - from harm , say @entity24 and @entity25 , co-authors of the paper in the @entity28 acceptable ? the authors of a new medical paper have claimed that doctors should , in some cases , be able to use the internet search engine , @entity8 , to seek information on the people they are caring for ( file picture ) although the @entity38 's ( @entity38 ) guidelines provide doctors with general advice on the use of the @entity32 , they do not explicitly refer to the practice of ' googling ' , the co-authors claim			1
despite this so - called ' @entity8 blind spot ' , physicians ' use of the search engine to find out patients ' details is typically perceived ( by both the public and doctors themselves ) as an invasion of privacy			1
but in their paper , @entity24 and @entity25 say that there are 10 situations in which it may be ' ethically valid and even warranted ' for healthcare professionals to engage in ' patient - targeted @entity59 '			1
these include when the doctor has a duty to ' warn of possible harm ' , if there is evidence of ' doctor shopping ' , if the patient gives ' evasive responses ' or if they have made claims that ' seem improbable '			1
they also include when the patient 's story is discredited by other ' reliable healthcare professionals ' the doctor suspects physical or substance abuse , or if the patient is believed to be potentially suicidal			1
' notably , all of these potential situations ... are at their core concerned with patient safety , ' @entity24 , a @entity76 genetics counselor , writes in the paper , available online			1
co-authors : sometimes ' patient - targeted @entity84 ' is necessary to protect patients - and others - from harm , say @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) , co-authors of the @entity28 paper speaking to @entity90 , @entity25 , an assistant professor in @entity92 at @entity93 , adds : ' there is something worth protecting in the physician - patient relationship			1
' despite their list of 10 situations , the authors believe that , most of the time , ' patient - targeted @entity84 ' is not acceptable			1
they hope their paper will spark conversation among medical experts about whether the @entity38 's guidelines should be updated in a digital age where search engines are ubiquitous			1
in the document , the pair detail two real - life situations at @entity93 when they felt the practice of ' @entity84 ' was not only warranted , but necessary , to ensure patients ' and others ' safety			1
authors @entity24 and @entity25 claim there are 10 situations in which it may be ' ethically valid and even warranted ' for doctors to engage in ' patient - targeted @entity59 '			1
five of these are as follows : 1			0
the doctor has a duty to warn of ' possible harm ' 2			1
the patient has provided ' evasive responses to logical clinical questions ' 3			0
the patient has made ' improable ' claims about their personal or family history 4			0
the doctor has suspicions ' regarding physical and / or substance abuse ' 5			2
the doctor has concerns over a suicide risk source : ' navigating the @entity133 : an @entity134 to @entity84 '			2
in one of the cases , a 27 - year - old breast cancer sufferer underwent a series of cancer predisposition tests and was counseled about the results			2
but several years later , an amended report was released			0
the new findings showed the woman had a rare bone marrow failure disorder that would affect all of her future children			0
the report also held ' clinically important information ' for the patient 's relatives			2
however , despite repeated attempts to contact the woman , a clinician was unable to do so			0
therefore , ' googling ' was ' viewed as a requirement to fulfill a professional obligation ' , @entity24 and @entity25 write			1
in the other case , a 26 - year - old woman requested that both of her breasts be removed to prevent breast cancer , even though she had not been tested to see if she was at risk for the disease			0
according to the co-authors , she reported an ' almost unbelievable ' family history of breast , ovarian and esophageal cancer			0
she had also sought the same surgery at other hospitals , they write in their paper			0
when a medic ' googled ' the woman , she was found to be ' presenting her cancer story at lay conferences , giving newspaper interviews , and blogging about her experience as a cancer survivor			0
' she was also determined to be ' raising funds , perhaps fraudulently , to attend a national cancer conference '			0
the surgeon subsequently refused to carry out the surgery without formal tests			0
although @entity24 and @entity25 aim to highlight the ways in which ' @entity84 ' patients can be warranted in 10 cases in their paper , they also acknowledge it can undermine trust among the public and medics			1
@entity191 search engine : although the @entity38 's guidelines provide doctors with general advice on the use of the @entity32 , they do not explicitly refer to the practice of ' googling ' , the co-authors say ( file picture ) ' you have a patient wanting to adopt healthy lifestyles , and the doctor helps him on a course of exercise and non-smoking , ' @entity24 explained			1
' but the doctor ' googles ' him and sees pictures he posted on @entity208 smoking a cigar			0
' @entity210 , president of the @entity213 , @entity212 - based bioethics institute @entity211 , congratulated the authors for raising questions surrounding the @entity38 's guidelines			2
however , she said that their ' acceptable ' reasons for searching for patients ' details are too broad			0
instead , she claims the doctor 's intention is the key in determining whether ' @entity84 ' is wrong			2
' why is the physician motivated to do this ? is it going to bring benefit to the patient , or is it something self - serving or out of personal curiosity ? ' @entity225 asked			2
a spokesman for the @entity38 declined to comment to @entity90 , citing the issue as ' unresolved ' by the organization			2
however , a 2013 policy statement from @entity235 notes that physician use of digital tools must evolve as do technology and societal trends			0
it acknowledges the use of ' patient - targeted @entity59 ' in medical crises , such as attempts to identify unconscious patients in emergency departments			1
but , according to the policy , ' it instead can be linked to curiosity , voyeurism and habit			0
although anecdotal reports highlight some benefit ( for example , intervening when a patient is blogging about suicide ) , real potential exists for blurring professional and personal boundaries			2
' the paper 's authors say they wish only for more dialogue about this digital practice			0
' i think this is just a starting point , ' @entity25 said			0
' every conversation has to start with something			0
this is the raw clay that we hope the field sculpts into set guidelines			0
' @entity24 and @entity25 's paper , ' navigating the @entity133 : an emerging need for @entity273 to @entity84 ' , appears in the journal 's january print edition .			1

co-authors @entity24 and @entity25 claim that doctors should , in some cases , be able to use @entity8 to seek information on their patients
list 10 *scenarios* in which this may be ' ethically valid ' or even ' warranted '
these include when doctor has a duty to warn patient of ' possible harm '
also include if healthcare professional suspects physical or drug abuse
but pair say in most cases , ' patient - targeted @entity84 ' is *unacceptable*
they hope their paper will spark debate about current @entity38 guidelines
