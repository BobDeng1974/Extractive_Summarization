a convicted murderer sentenced to more than a half - century behind bars is suing the state of @entity3 , saying its ban on pornography in prison violates his constitutional rights			1
@entity9 , 44 , says in the lawsuit filed in @entity11 in july that guards have used the policy to deny him an art book , @entity14 of @entity15 , which uses nude models to help show how to draw the human form			1
@entity18 says the ban is a violation of his free speech rights and serves no meaningful objective in prison			1
the state filed its response monday , saying @entity18 has not been harmed by the ban and none of his rights were violated			1
my right to porn : @entity32 , 40 , said he is suing the state of @entity3 because the ban on pornography in prison violates his constitutional rights ' any injury or harm , if any , was caused solely by plaintiff 's own acts , omissions , or conduct and was not due to any wrongful conduct by the defendants , ' assistant attorney general @entity35 wrote			1
the state department of correction put out the administrative directive in 2011			0
it bans all material that contains ' pictorial depictions of sexual activity or nudity ' from the prisons			1
but it also says the ban should not apply to ' materials which , taken as a whole , are literary , artistic , educational or scientific in nature '			0
a prison spokesman at the time said the ban was intended to improve the work environment for prison staffers , especially female staffers , who might be inadvertently exposed to pornography			0
it led to a letter - writing campaign and threats of lawsuits from inmates upset with the policy			0
@entity69 , a spokeswoman for the attorney general 's office , said about a half dozen lawsuits have been filed since then challenging the ban in both federal and state courts			2
she said those cases are still being litigated			0
but a judge in 2012 refused to issue a preliminary injunction allowing inmate @entity78 to possess magazines like @entity80			0
' although prisoners do not forfeit all of their constitutional rights upon incarceration , the fact of incarceration and the needs of the prison system impose limitations on prisoners ' constitutional rights , even those derived from the @entity92 , ' the judge wrote in his ruling			2
prison : a convicted murderer at @entity96 in @entity3 thinks he should be able to view sexually explicit materials @entity98 , a law professor at @entity99 , said courts have generally sided with prison officials in such cases if they can prove the ban has a legitimate goal other than to simply suppress material that some people might find objectionable â€” such as maintaining safety in the prisons or keeping the material out of the hands of sex offenders			1
but he said the lawsuit has a chance of succeeding if @entity18 can show it was improperly used in his case to suppress art or literature			2
' i think that 's a much stronger argument than saying the statute itself is facially unconstitutional , ' he said			0
@entity18 is serving a 56 - year sentence for his part in the 1998 slaying of a 35 - year - old father of two in @entity128			1
@entity130 was shot up to five times in the head with two guns and stabbed in the heart seven times with a sword , authorities said			0
@entity18 led authorities to the skeletal remains two years after the killing , which he said was committed by another man .			2
