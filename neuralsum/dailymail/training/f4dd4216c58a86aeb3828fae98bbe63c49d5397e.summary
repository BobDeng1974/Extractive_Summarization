by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 14:13 est , 1 may 2013 updated : 12:09 est , 2 may 2013 military chiefs are urgently reviewing the protection offered by the @entity6 ’s heavily - armoured mastiff vehicles after three @entity8 soldiers were killed in one by a massive roadside bomb in @entity10			1
they are the first troops to have died in one of the 23 - ton personnel carriers which have withstood hundreds of attacks since they were brought in specifically to combat the threat from improvised explosive devices ( ieds ) in 2007			1
six other soldiers were injured by the @entity19 bomb which may have contained up to 440lb of high explosives			2
instead , the casualties were apparently caused by the vehicle being blown into the air and the force of the impact when it landed and rolled on to its roof			1
yesterday @entity41 confirmed he wanted defence chiefs to look into whether the right equipment was being used			0
he said : ‘ we have done an enormous amount to improve the quality and quantity of protective vehicles that our soldiers use out in @entity10 and , as i understand , it had a pretty good record of withstanding blasts from ieds			2
' i ’m sure we ’ll want to look at that carefully and put in place everything we can to make sure that our brave men and women have the best protective equipment they have			0
‘ the troops have said to me they were pretty satisfied with what they had , but we must always look at this			2
’ the prime minister added that the @entity8 had paid a ‘ very high price ’ for the work to stabilise @entity10			0
general @entity71 , the former head of the @entity6 , said : ‘ the @entity19 have found a way of countering the protective qualities of the @entity33			1
it would seem that this was an extremely large bomb that was so powerful it was able to cause fatalities within the vehicle itself			2
’ he warned that @entity8 must brace itself for more bloody attacks in @entity10 before 9,000 combat troops are pulled out by the end of 2014			2
targeted : three @entity8 soldiers were killed in @entity10 when their @entity33 armoured vehicle which was introduced to protect troops was devastated by a huge roadside bomb ( file picture ) killed : the soldiers ( not pictured ) were flown to the military hospital at @entity84 but could not be saved lord @entity71 said the history of any campaign showed that ‘ often those we are fighting increase their efforts towards the end to try and play up the fact that they have driven us out or to increase their hand in bargaining at the negotiating table ’			1
two of the soldiers who died in the attack on tuesday were corporal @entity100 , 30 , and fusilier @entity24 , 21 , from the @entity25 , 2nd @entity30 ( 2 scots )			1
the third was private @entity102 , 25 , a reservist with the 51st @entity103 , 7th @entity104 ( 7 scots ) , who was deployed with 2 scots			1
@entity108 – nicknamed @entity107 – who was born in @entity109 , @entity28 , was described as a ‘ shining example of a soldier and a rising star ’			0
his wife @entity113 , who is expecting their first child , said : ‘ i am completely devastated but extremely proud of @entity107			1
i have lost the love of my life			0
’ fusilier @entity118 , from @entity120 , was described as a ‘ vastly impressive soldier ’			2
his family said they were ‘ completely devastated ’			0
@entity124 had represented @entity28 at lacrosse and was said to have ‘ epitomised everything that is excellent about the reserve forces ’			0
the men and their six comrades were on a routine patrol in the @entity133 - e @entity132 district of @entity135 province when they were attacked			0
the deaths take the number of @entity8 soldiers killed in @entity10 to 444			0
' paying a high price ' : it is the biggest single loss of life inflicted by a buried bomb since six soldiers died when their warrior armoured vehicle ( above ) struck an ied in march last year the ied , which may have been dug into the tarred road surface when it softened during the winter , could have been detonated remotely			1
the @entity33 carries electronic counter-measures to jam remote - controlled ieds , and investigators will check for links between the massive blast and @entity154 which is suspected of providing the @entity19 with bomb training as well as equipment and techniques to avoid jamming devices			1
major @entity159 , an @entity6 bomb disposal operator , said : ‘ the @entity161 are the most heavily - armoured vehicles we ’ve ever used in a counter-insurgency			1
but any system can be overcome given sufficient time , money and resources			0
’ overdue : the @entity169 's other main armoured vehicle , the warrior , was heavily criticised by a coroner five years ago for not having enough protection			1
improvements were finally made in june 2011 defence source lieutenant colonel @entity175 , a former commander of troops in @entity135 , said : ‘ whilst you can do everything possible to try to mitigate the risks , you ca n’t eradicate them totally and nothing is indestructible			0
’ an @entity169 spokesman said : ‘ if you have an explosion that ’s big enough to lift a vehicle and roll it , you always have the possibility that it will lift and soldiers will be killed			2
you can never armour a vehicle enough to withstand every kind of blast			2
’ the attack came three days after the @entity19 launched its ‘ spring offensive ’ against coalition forces			0
the @entity19 said they would infiltrate ‘ enemy ranks ’ to conduct ‘ insider attacks ’ and target military and diplomatic sites with suicide bombers			0
scene : the soldiers were on a routine patrol in the @entity133 - e @entity132 district of @entity135 video : @entity41 reacts to soldier deaths a total of 444 @entity8 troops have been killed in @entity10 since @entity207 forces invaded the country in 2001 in response to the september 11 attacks			1
in addition , more than 2,000 @entity212 troops and over 600 soldiers from other countries in the @entity216 coalition have died as a result of fighting with the @entity19			1
the latest deaths bring the total of @entity8 casualties in 2013 so far to six , all in the dangerous @entity135 which is often considered a @entity19 stronghold			0

while many parts of the country remain unsafe , the rate of @entity8 casualties has been slowing as @entity207 troops have gradually pulled out of their operations in @entity10			0
