a debate in the @entity1 is the last place you expect to hear someone fantasise about making love to @entity6			1
but it is precisely what cheeky typist - turned - @entity9 minister @entity8 did when she persuaded fuddy - duddy peers to back gay marriage laws			1
lords leader @entity12 used @entity6 to explain how a man who married another man could only sue for adultery if his partner had sex with a woman , not a man			1
for example , she told dumbstruck peers , if @entity6 married a gay man and then had a fling with her – ‘ and who could blame him ? ’ she added coyly – @entity6 ’s ‘ husband ’ could sue him for adultery with her			1
crush : @entity12 , who referred to @entity6 in a debate , with a cardboard cut - out of the actor sure enough , a photo of @entity8 alongside a life - sized cardboard cut - out of the star has pride of place in her tennis court - sized , red leather and wood - panelled @entity1 office , where we chatted			1
‘ i ’ve had a soft spot for him ever since i saw him in @entity46 , ’ she says			2
‘ i needed to relax peers who were tense about gay marriage , so i thought , “ i ’ll bring in @entity6			1
” ’ and fantasise about having sex with him ? ‘ a bit of humour helps , ’ she smiles			1
@entity8 is to extend the gay marriage laws in the next few weeks , allowing gay people who took part in civil partnerships before gay marriage was legalised to ‘ upgrade ’ it into a formal marriage			1
‘ it ’s important for them to say not “ i ’m sort of married ” but that they are married , ’ she says			1
when @entity8 was made @entity64 – a cabinet minister in all but name – in july , some grandees were appalled , even more than when she was ennobled three years ago			1
they reacted with the same haughty disdain that @entity68 ’s @entity67 showed sparky kitchen maid @entity69 on learning she was studying maths instead of washing dishes			2
‘ @entity8 should be pushing the tea trolley at @entity78 , not sitting at the table , ’ scoffed one , a reference to her having been @entity74 to @entity75 and @entity76			2
in truth , ‘ the @entity67 of @entity86 ’ @entity80 had exposed her to such insults by denying @entity8 full - blown @entity78 status – and £ 22,000 extra pay – given to her predecessor			2
@entity8 , 5ft 1in , faced a revolt led by @entity12 @entity88 , who accused the @entity89 of ‘ trampling on the constitution ’			2
did n’t little @entity8 feel cowed by all these people fulminating at her ? ‘ i do n’t feel intimidated by anybody			1
i was brought up to believe i ’m as good as anyone else			2
@entity8 's doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause @entity8 , 47 , whose dad @entity99 was a painter and decorator and mum @entity101 worked in a factory in the same street as their terrace house in @entity106 , @entity107 ( ‘ it was posh , we had an inside loo ’ , she laughs ) left her local comp aged 16 with five o - levels			2
she showed her gritty determination aged 14 , landing a weekend job at a cake shop			2
‘ they said i could n’t work out front until i knew the price of all 100 cakes , ’ she says			2
‘ when i went back the next week , they could n’t believe i knew them all			2
’ how much was a doughnut ? ‘ 12p , ’ she answers			2
‘ if i saw a big queue outside i ’d try my hardest to get it down and it brought a big smile to my face when i did			0
’ does n’t it require loftier thinking to be a cabinet minister ? she swats it away like a fly on a sticky bun			0
‘ @entity1 may seem a million miles from the cake shop , but those people in the queue are who i think of when i do my job here , ’ she says			1
her cool confidence and prim porcelain glamour is a far cry from the unworldly lass mistaken for a hooker when , aged 18 , she was dropped off by mum and dad at a hostel in @entity146 , for her first @entity148 job as a secretary			0
‘ i was stopped by a bloke who said “ are you looking for business ? ” i said “ sorry ? ” i did n’t know what he was on about			0
when i told the girls in the hostel , they said “ did n’t you know ? this a red light area ”			0
’ her horizons widened with a stint at the @entity163 in @entity164 , and she joined @entity86 when @entity75 was prime minister			0
she recalls her rage when she overheard a plummy - voiced @entity9 sneer at ‘ ignorant ’ @entity167 , unaware his loyal @entity74 was listening			0
‘ the very things people criticised him for like his humble background are why i admired him			1
i do n’t like snobs , ’ she says			0
she formed the same bond with the next @entity9 leader @entity76 , adding : ‘ when he stepped down , i sobbed my heart out			0
’ but there were tears of joy when , a decade later , now a minister with her own @entity74 , she piloted the gay marriage laws through the @entity1			1
‘ i was choked with happiness , ’ she says			0
@entity12 told dumbstruck peers that if @entity6 married a gay man and then had a fling with her , @entity6 's ' husband ' could sue him for adultery with her first she had to persuade crusty peers to take notice of someone who had never been married herself			1
again she deployed her ‘ friend ’ @entity6 , telling the @entity1 bold as brass in her broad @entity107 accent : ‘ i ’m single but as long as @entity6 is available i ’m prepared to wait			1
’ even peers who raged about the ‘ evils of buggery ’ softened			0
@entity8 ’s doggedness and impish charm was widely credited with wooing reluctant peers to her cause			0
that was a year ago			0
‘ it ’s his loss , there you go , no more excuses , ’ she grins			0
she has never been short of male admirers , so why no marriage ? ‘ no one ever asked me ! ’ you have to go looking			1
‘ maybe i ’ll start			0
perhaps it is the price she has paid for her career ? ‘ no , ’ she says firmly , ‘ i do n’t rule it out , though i ’m probably past having children			0
@entity216 drilled it into me never to be financially dependent on a man , get a job , fend for yourself			1
’ the gay marriage law made her a gay icon , leading to awards from @entity225 and @entity227 magazine			1
@entity8 ’s , dare i say it , rather raunchy , pixie - like @entity231 photo has a hint of the @entity233 in it			0
she is dolled up , albeit on a budget			0
her black and berry @entity236 jacket is £ 79 from the suitably conservative @entity238			0
some gay rights campaigners have speculated whether petite @entity8 is gay ? ‘ oh really ? ’ she replied			1
is she ? ‘ no , ’ she says , her bright blue bush baby eyes gleaming			0
and she is again quick to scotch any idea that she may never marry			0
‘ if a fantastic guy turned up and offered me a life better than the one i have now , why would i say no ? ’ she says			0
‘ now @entity6 is taken , i ’m back on the market			1

@entity64 used @entity6 to explain how a man who married another man could only sue for adultery if his partner had sex with a woman , not a man
she is to to extend the gay marriage laws in the next few weeks
will allow gay people who took part in civil partnerships before gay marriage was legalised to ' upgrade ' into a formal marriage
