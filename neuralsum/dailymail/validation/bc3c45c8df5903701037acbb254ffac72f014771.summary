@entity0 has issued a typically blunt assessment of the @entity3 report into past practices of doping and suggested @entity7 's charity return to the @entity8 ' could be done in a different environment '			1
@entity3 was established to investigate whether the @entity13 , cycling 's world governing body , was complicit in past doping practices , such as the @entity7 affair , which saw the @entity16 stripped of his seven @entity8 titles and banned for life			1
some of the reports findings were scathing but , according to 2011 world champion and 25 - time tour stage winner @entity0 , little was revelatory			2
@entity0 says there were few revelations in the @entity3 report the 25 - time @entity8 stage winner said the report was ' all the s * * * that 's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document ' @entity0 , speaking after announcing he 'll compete in august 's @entity32 , said : ' to be brutally honest , i do n't really think there 's anything new in there			1
' there 's all the s * * * that 's been out there the last few years just compiled into the one document			0
' people talk about the past of cycling like it 's the present			0
it 's a little bit frustrating ; that would be an understatement			0
' as long as cycling 's cleaning up and i 'm racing in a fair playing field in a sport i love , then i 'll continue to be happy with that			0
' one unnamed but ' respected ' professional cyclist told @entity3 that 90 per cent of the professional peloton continues to dope , while another reported the figure was 20 per cent			2
@entity0 does n't see much use in the report , commissioned by new @entity13 president @entity59 @entity0 did not confirm if he had read the report in full or just the media dispatches which followed its publication earlier this month			1
he did not speak to @entity3 and was unaware that riders could approach the commission to share their views			0
asked if he felt the report represented the views of the modern peloton , @entity0 said : ' absolutely not			1
i was n't asked at all to say anything			2
' ninety - five per cent of the peloton will know the one rider who will have said certain comments and the other five per cent wo n't have raced or known that rider , so could n't comment on it			0
' i think certain quotes from unreliable sources do n't really mean anything and completely warp the sense of the whole process			0
' @entity7 plans to return to the tour alongside former footballer @entity83 , another cancer survivor			2
@entity7 ( left ) plans to return to the @entity8 , the event for which he was stripped of seven titles due to doping , as part of a charity ride with former footballer @entity83 @entity83 is riding the @entity8 route one day ahead of the professional peloton , which includes @entity0 , to raise funds for charity and has invited @entity7 to join him			1
@entity0 said : ' there 's no denying what @entity7 did for charity ; he did work a lot for charity			1
' but maybe this situation could be done in a different environment			0

@entity0 *questioned* the use of the *recently* released @entity3 report
he said : ' to be brutally honest , i do n't really think there 's anything new '
@entity0 said he was n't asked to be *interviewed* as part of the report
he added @entity7 's charity involvement with this year 's @entity8 with @entity83 ' could be done in a different environment '
@entity0 will compete in august 's @entity32
