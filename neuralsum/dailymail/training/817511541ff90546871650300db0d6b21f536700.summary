by @entity0 follow @ @ draper_rob managers have a habit of talking up the opposition , especially after they have won			0
it ’s not a particularly subtle way of amplifying your own team ’s qualities			2
clearly if the side you have beaten are excellent , then that only magnifies your own achievement			0
so when @entity14 praised @entity15 at the end his 2 - 1 win over them on sunday night , the warm words had to be filtered through a more cynical prism			1
and yet , even given that proviso , it is worth recording what he said			0
video : scroll down to watch @entity26 's verdict on @entity15 v @entity27 rising star : @entity29 provided huge encouragement for @entity15 in their @entity32 opener raising their game : @entity35 has brought a better brand of football to the @entity15 team ‘ we know @entity15 have changed a lot in the last few years , ’ said @entity14			1
‘ they used to play with long balls and headers			0
now @entity15 are very good playing in triangles and one on one			1
they really have one the strongest attacks in the @entity32			0
' i ’ve been really consistent in what i ’ve been saying : we played against a great team			2
’ perhaps he was ladling it on a little by the end			0
@entity15 are not a great side but they do have the potential to be a good one			1
it is @entity14 ’s line about @entity15 playing in triangles that perhaps offers the most encouragement			1
it was n’t just about the speed of @entity15 on saturday night , which , should they progress , will surely worry any side they face			1
they actually moved the ball nicely at times , engineering their way out of tight spaces with neat passing			0
it ’s not the first time @entity15 have done it			1
foreign coaches once were similarly complementary about the improvements that @entity74 and @entity75 had made to @entity15 ’s style but progressive football was somehow abandoned once the expensive foreign imports took over the reins of management			1
high praise : @entity27 manager @entity14 was full of praise for @entity35 's new - look team passing game : both @entity74 in @entity85 ( left ) and @entity75 at @entity86 98 ( right ) tried to improve @entity15 's style it seems it takes an @entity89 coach to believe @entity89 players can actually play a little : @entity91 and @entity92 never seemed to trust them to do so			1
too often at @entity15 have been like the unwanted drunken guest , stumbling over tables and embarrassing everyone with their inappropriate aggression			2
on saturday , in a @entity32 that has sparkled so far , @entity15 behaved like part of the in - crowd at the party , entertaining and impressing			1
true , they lost , a not inconsiderable draw back			0
but most would take defeat in this manner over the 0 - 0 abject draw with @entity105 in @entity106 in 2010 ; or the laboured victories over @entity108 and @entity109 in 2006			0
who would have known that @entity35 had been repressing these attacking instincts ? like a suburban bank manager who indulges a secret passion for clubbing at the weekends , he indulged every populist call in deploying @entity116 from the start , refusing to kowtow to @entity118 and in bringing on @entity119			1
a few @entity121 fans might be bemused by the manager @entity15 have employed			2
he would argue that he did n’t have these players at @entity121			0
back then : @entity15 played brilliant football at @entity85 but reverted to a long - ball game with foreign coaches pride : even in defeat @entity15 played well and will progress if they perform to that level in the next two games yet on saturday night , @entity15 seemed to play with freedom , as though they embracing the challenge rather enduring it			1
not that the game was without issues			0
ultimately @entity15 ’s failure to pick up @entity136 for @entity27 ’s first goal was inexplicable in a team managed by @entity35 , who is so meticulous on his team shape and player responsibilities			1
good though @entity142 ’s dummy was , @entity136 had a free strike			0
it was a goal that was easily prevented			0
and @entity145 wo n’t relish the re-runs of @entity147 turning him the wrong way to deliver the deep , looping cross for @entity151 to score			0
and then there is @entity118			2
@entity35 defended him on saturday night and it is true that for long periods he performed in his required role as well as delivering a superb cross for @entity159 ’s goal			2
‘ we wanted to get @entity116 around @entity142 because of his agility and of course that meat moving @entity118 and i thought that worked well , ’ said @entity35			1
‘ he set up the goal for us , he worked very hard and did well also when we brought him back into the centre			0
' there ’s always going to be one player who there ’s a big debate around but i think it ’s very harsh to criticise @entity118 ’s performance today because for me he played well			2
’ passing success : @entity35 's decision to get @entity15 playing a more dynamic game will produce results down but not out : @entity118 was disappointing but he offers enough to be picked against @entity178 that said , @entity159 , @entity180 and @entity116 played better			1
the debate for @entity178 now boils down to whether @entity118 is better than @entity182 ? as an attacking threat he is and as such he starts in a game @entity15 must win			1
however , it might be argued that @entity182 would have have dealt with full back @entity187 better and would have had the energy to offer greater protection to @entity145			2
significantly , @entity35 felt the need to switch @entity180 to the left at half time , to curtail the @entity194 right back – though he still popped up providing the pass for @entity147 ’s cross and @entity151 ’s goal			1
and then there is the small matter of defeat			0
under @entity91 and @entity92 @entity15 often looked awful ; but they did n’t lose in @entity32 group stages , though @entity91 did in his first game in @entity203 to @entity86			2
@entity15 could be figuratively packing their bags on thursday , slipping out of the party before the real dancing begins , returning home after briefly dazzling			1
it does n’t feel like that , however			0
not since 1998 and the honourable exit against @entity212 on penalties has defeat felt this good			0
the national mood wo n’t feel quite so generous if the result is the same on thursday ; but if the performance is repeated , there is little chance that it will be .			0

@entity14 's praise shows @entity15 are on the right track
performances of @entity116 and @entity119 encouraging
move towards passing football for the first time since @entity74 and @entity75
*optimism* will *continue* if @entity35 's team repeat *perfomance* on thursday
@entity118 should start - he offers more than @entity182 going forward
