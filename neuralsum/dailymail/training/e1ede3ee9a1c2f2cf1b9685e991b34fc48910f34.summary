@entity1 judges yesterday deprived convicts and their no - win , no - fee lawyers of a seven - figure payout in the long - running saga over prisoner votes			1
a serial killer , paedophiles and child murderers were among 1,015 inmates claiming compensation – estimated at £ 1,000 each – for being denied the vote in general elections			1
at the same time , they and their human rights lawyers were seeking thousands in legal costs , and even submitted a claim to be reimbursed for the stamps and envelopes they used to submit their case , legal papers showed			1
the @entity22 confirmed earlier rulings , dating back to 2005 , that it is unlawful for @entity25 to have a blanket ban on prisoners voting			1
but , in a victory for the taxpayer , the judges rejected the claim for costs and a cash settlement			1
@entity34 has claimed the idea of inmates taking part in elections makes him ' physically ill ' and vowed to challenge any ruling giving a right to vote it is thought that the decision will save the @entity25 £ 1million in compensation alone – and it will be seen as a conciliatory gesture in @entity46			1
@entity47 , a @entity49 firm of solicitors which represented more than 550 of the prisoners , is planning to lodge an appeal			2
effectively , the lawyers have been left to pick up the cost of bringing the claims , and could be heavily out of pocket			2
the claimants include @entity58 , the ‘ @entity65 ’ , who was jailed for a minimum of 30 years for three murders and seven rapes in the 1980s , and @entity62 , 60 , serving life for raping and strangling his seven - year - old niece in 1977			1
the lead applicant was @entity67 , 88 , a sex offender			0
the court ’s ruling has kicked a decision on how to sanction @entity25 over the voting ban into the long grass until after the election in may			1
the ‘ @entity65 ’ , who was jailed for a minimum of 30 years for three murders and seven rapes in the 1980s following conservative threats to leave the controversial court ’s jurisdiction , a string of verdicts have gone @entity25 ’s way – such as last week ’s judgment that it is acceptable to hand whole - life sentences to the worst killers			2
@entity34 , with the backing of a majority of mps , has said that the prospect of giving prisoners the vote makes him feel physically ‘ sick ’			1
yesterday @entity94 , the justice secretary , said : ‘ this issue exactly demonstrates why the @entity96 have pledged in a majority government to make changes to the human rights framework in the @entity25			0
' i believe our @entity101 should have the final say over matters like this			0
’ a senior government source said : ‘ the truth is @entity108 knows the @entity96 are serious when they say they want a fundamental shift in power , so that decision - making happens in this country and not over there			0
‘ which makes the idea of a @entity117 majority at the general election in a few months all the more frightening			2
‘ we ’d be straight back to square one , with the court wanting to flex its muscles , and without any prospect of reform to the human rights framework			0
’ conservative backbenchers said the verdict showed what could be achieved if @entity25 stood up to @entity130 institutions			0
@entity132 mp @entity131 said : ‘ the @entity22 made clear it ca n’t force @entity25 to change its democratically elected law			2
‘ that exposes as nonsense the claim that protecting our democratic rights would cost the taxpayer a fortune or lead to us being kicked out of the @entity140			0
ironically , @entity108 has boosted the case for @entity132 reform of our human rights laws			0
’ the @entity22 in @entity108 ruled the ban breached inmates ' rights , but ruled out awarding compensation @entity148 , of think - tank @entity149 , said : ‘ this verdict , made by an unelected court which has no democratic legitimacy , is wrong and dangerous			1
’ @entity154 , of law firm @entity47 , said it would be seeking a review of the decision not to award compensation			0
‘ we seem to be in the sad position where the government is taking an almost perverse pleasure in ignoring successive court judgments , ’ he said			0
‘ it should be worrying to all of us that the government appears to have so little regard for its international human rights obligations			0
