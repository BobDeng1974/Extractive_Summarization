@entity0 have taken a swipe at exiled loanee @entity2 via their matchday programme – and he will again be forced to train with the reserves should @entity5 , as expected , send him back to @entity6 next month			1
@entity7 will not allow the @entity9 winger , whom he chose to get rid of during the summer after becoming disillusioned with his ‘ lack of professionalism ’ , to disrupt the team spirit he has harnessed on @entity14 this season			1
and @entity0 ’s programme was quick to remind supporters of @entity2 ’s current struggle for form with a page detailing his ‘ torrid ’ performance at @entity22 , during which he was substituted before half - time			2
@entity5 's @entity2 ( left ) was hooked by @entity24 in the first against @entity22 last month @entity0 made reference to @entity2 's ' torrid ' performance against @entity22 in their matchday programme so far , @entity7 and the club have preferred not to mention the 27 - year - old and the boss was a little miffed at one press conference when – amid @entity22 ’s six - match winning run - a @entity9 journalist repeatedly asked questions about @entity2 , forcing @entity0 ’s press officer to intervene			1
but the programme previewing saturday ’s 2 - 1 win over @entity38 made a point of highlighting @entity2 's poor display at @entity41			2
using a big picture of the player for the first time , they wrote : ‘ @entity2 lasted just 35 minutes of @entity5 ’s 3 - 0 defeat at @entity22 last saturday before being replaced by @entity47			0
@entity2 ( centre ) has struggled for form since moving to @entity5 on loan in the summer it is thought that the @entity9 winger could be sent back to @entity0 in january ‘ the @entity9 winger endured a torrid opening half hour at the hands of @entity54 ’s @entity22 before @entity55 boss @entity24 made the change			1
’ @entity24 has since been forced to deny that there was a fall - out with @entity2			0
@entity59 , however , understands the @entity5 boss has lost patience with his deadline - day signing , who has failed to score in eight appearances and has been left out of the last two matchday squads			1
the player ’s work - rate is thought to be a major concern among the management team at the @entity70			0
@entity24 , whose side have slipped into the bottom three after a run of eight without a victory , said : ‘ there is no disputing that he has got ability but ability is n’t enough at this level , so he will be training like everyone else will be training			0
the @entity0 matchday programme took a swipe at @entity2 , describing his display at @entity22 as ' torrid ' ‘ we have now got four or five weeks until january and we could lose three or four players next week and then there is a chance that he might be back in			2
‘ we will see what december and january brings and have a sit down and see where we all are			0
’ @entity2 , via his @entity93 account , says there is no rift with @entity24 : ‘ i just wanted to clarify my situation , ’ he wrote			0
‘ i have no problem with my coach ( @entity24 )			0
this is someone that i love that i respect and i admire ! ’ @entity2 ’s contract at @entity0 is up at the end of the season and , should he return to the club in january , it is thought they will allow him to leave on loan for the remainder of his deal .			1
