by @entity0 with litter strewn across the street and bin bags stacked high , @entity4 was certainly the least likely candidate to win any prizes for looking pretty			1
but the @entity8 residents are hoping to turn that unsavoury reputation on its head by bidding for glory in this year 's @entity13 competition			1
millions watched as @entity4 in @entity15 , @entity8 , became the litter - strewn scene for the most controversial documentary on @entity19 tv			1
digging in : @entity20 pictured with councillor @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 , hopes @entity4 can win @entity19 in bloom no prizes here : @entity4 was depicted as filled with litter in the @entity29 series , @entity4 @entity30 , drug taking , shoplifting and anti-social behaviour attracted hundreds of complaints and helped the five - part series make headlines around the world			1
in the second episode , filmed last year , viewers watched as rubbish was left to pile high in the road after the council 's binmen refused to collect the waste because bags were opened by gangs searching for scrap metal			1
it was amid this battle of the bin bags that determined @entity4 resident @entity50 boldly decided to enter her road in the @entity19 in @entity52			1
now the 79 - year - old is leading her neighbourhood 's entry in this year 's competition			2
the campaign was launched yesterday with a family - friendly big dig day at the community garden on the grounds of @entity62 , situated behind @entity4			1
several of @entity20 's neighbours turned out to support the event , but as they set to work there was no sign of some of the the documentary 's biggest contributors , including @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and young couple @entity74 and @entity75			2
' we 're hoping to do a bit better than eighth place this year , ' said @entity20			2
' @entity19 in @entity24 is 50 this year so we 're trying to make everything gold and will be growing lots of sunflowers			1
' like many of the show 's ' stars ' , @entity20 accused the @entity29 documentary makers at @entity87 of ' cleverly editing ' the series to make it more explosive and appealing to viewers			1
' they did a lot filming here in the garden , but did not put it on tv , which was disappointing , ' she said			0
' it was n't quite as eye - catching as some of the other scenes i suppose			0
' they exaggerated it with all the cigarettes and tinnies in the street - some people said they ( the film - makers ) gave them to residents			2
' the programme showed loads of people spilling out onto the street at night , but it 's nothing like that			2
' controversy : @entity4 and its participants , including @entity71 , sparked debate across the nation the film - makers have insisted that the series was accurate and representative			1
they have also denied giving cigarettes and alcohol to encourage contributors to go before the cameras			0
the show portrayed @entity4 and many of its inhabitants in a poor light , but @entity20 insisted a lot of good had come from it			1
she said : ' i had a laugh when i watched it			0
' i think it 's brought the community closer together			0
' it also highlighted a lot of problems we had concerning scavengers taking rubbish out of the bin bags			1
' since then , the council have been on top of it and the waste collections have never been affected			0
' it was no more damaging than if it had been filmed on any other street in any other major city			2
' we 've had hundreds of people come from all over to visit the street and have their picture taken with us			2
' we have a very mixed community here and there 's no problems with each other , which i think came across on the show			0
' it 's been good publicity on the whole			0
' seeds for success : residents of @entity165 and @entity166 get behind the competition @entity20 said she did not begrudge @entity71 , real name @entity71 , from appearing on other tv shows and writing in magazines			0
' i keep saying to people that with all the tv appearances she 's making she 's likely to come off benefits soon , ' she said			0
' that 's got to be good for everyone			0
' but councillor @entity21 , who joined the @entity177 , said it was people like @entity20 who were the ' true heroes ' of @entity4 - and the @entity15 community			1
' people talk about @entity71 being the mother of the street , but these are the true heroes who give up their time , voluntarily , to enhance the area , ' he said			2
' @entity15 has had a lot of bad press , so it 's time the area moved on and hopefully this @entity19 in @entity24 campaign can help with that			1
' gardening is a recreational activity that is good for health and well - being , but also allows people to grow their own food which is important in the current economic climate			0
' the community garden is an integral part of @entity15 's @entity13 scheme spearheaded by the @entity201 , the local church and ward councillors			0
the once - overgrown site has been transformed since 2009 into a pleasant green space thanks to a Â£ 20,000 injection from various partners and agencies			0
changing the reputation : @entity4 residents are bidding for first prize in the @entity19 in @entity24 competition it now contains a sensory garden , a woodland walkway , a wildlife pond , raised beds suitable for people with disabilities , and a poly tunnel for growing less hardy vegetables			1
project leader @entity23 said some of the soil beds were being used by pupils from three local schools to grow fresh produce			0
he said : ' the area has received some negative press after @entity4 , but the garden has already had such a positive impact on the community			1
' it encourages people of all ages , abilities and backgrounds to gettogether and learn about natural systems and biodiversity			0
' it provides physical health benefits by engaging people in outdoor activity and growing local food using organic methods			0
' the creation of spaces within the garden for quiet reflection and relaxation also provides benefits for mental health and emotional wellbeing			0
' as part of the @entity19 in @entity24 campaign , plant pots will be issued to local residents for them to paint , fill and hang outside their homes			1
mr @entity23 added : ' we 're asking people to sign up for a plant pot. ' it 's all about resident participation , trying to get people to put their rubbish out on the right day and discard of garden waste properly			2
