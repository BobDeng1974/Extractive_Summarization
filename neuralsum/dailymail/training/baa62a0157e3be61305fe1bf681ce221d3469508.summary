@entity40 spokesman @entity39 said the attack on @entity42 last thursday was not a massacre - as activists and many foreign leaders have claimed - but a military operation targeting armed fighters			1
' what happened was n’t an attack on civilians			1
what has been said about the use of heavy weapons is baseless , ” @entity39 told reporters in @entity54			1
he said 37 gunmen and two civilians were killed - a far lower death toll than the one put forward by anti-regime activists , some of whom estimate that up to 200 people were killed			1

the @entity77 said there was evidence that heavy weapons had been used but the @entity77 has already implicated @entity82 ’s forces in the assault			1
the head of the @entity77 observer mission said friday that monitors stationed near @entity42 saw the army using heavy weaponry and attack helicopters			1
although there has been a string of horrific attacks in @entity3 over the course of the uprising , the violence appears to be escalating			1
observers believe more than 150 people were killed , which if confirmed would make it one of the bloodiest episodes of @entity3 ’s 16 - month uprising			1
fifteen more people were killed elsewhere in the country today , activists said			1
among them was a family of four , including a girl whose body was pulled from rubble covered in blood and dust after their house was shelled in the central town of @entity114			1
the claims and counter-claims arose as @entity117 prepared to travel to @entity118 for talks with president @entity120 on the crisis			1
@entity122 has been an ally of @entity3 leader president @entity82 and his government , but has come under increased international pressure to support regime change			2
panic : @entity77 monitors confirmed that they had found pools of blood and a burned school in the village speaking at a news conference in the capital @entity54 , foreign ministry spokesman @entity39 said @entity3 government forces did not use helicopters and tanks in the assault on @entity42 , which happened on thursday			2

defense minister @entity148 and former defence minister @entity149 were also killed in the blast at the national security building in @entity153 interior minister @entity152 was wounded			2
rubble : a picture released by the @entity3 opposition 's @entity155 shows the destruction in the city of @entity13 on the streets : a @entity161 video allegedly shows government tanks on the move in the @entity165 neighbourhood of @entity54 forces loyal to @entity3 's president @entity82 being transported in a military vehicle in central @entity54 residents gather during the funeral of people , whom protesters say was killed by forces loyal to president @entity82 , at @entity175 near @entity54 in this image made from amateur video released by the @entity155 , smoke rises from buildings in @entity13 @entity54 - based activist @entity180 said @entity182 troops surrounded the nearby @entity183 where some officials were taken for treatment			2
the blast came on the same day the @entity187 was scheduled to vote on a new resolution aimed at pressuring the @entity3 regime to comply with a peace plan			2
two brigadier - generals were among some 600 @entity3 who fled from @entity3 to @entity192 overnight , a @entity192 official said on wednesday			2
it brings the number of @entity3 generals sheltering in @entity192 to 20 , including a retired general			2
the official could not immediately confirm if other defected officers had also arrived in @entity192 in the last 24 hours but said a number of lower - ranking soldiers usually accompanied defecting generals			0
the number of @entity3 refugees in @entity192 rose to 43,200 after 600 more arrived overnight , he said			0
but @entity122 remained at loggerheads with the @entity204 and its @entity206 allies over any mention of sanctions and chapter 7 of the @entity77 charter , which could eventually allow the use of force to end the conflict in @entity3			0
besides a government crackdown , rebel fighters are launching increasingly deadly attacks on regime targets , and several massive suicide attacks this year suggest @entity219 or other extremists are joining the fray			0
activists say more than 17,000 people have been killed since the uprising began in march 2011			0
the state - run news agency @entity225 reported that wednesday 's blast was aimed at the national security building , a headquarters for one of @entity3 's intelligence branches and less than 500 meters ( yards ) from the @entity204 embassy			0
police had cordoned off the area , and journalists were banned from approaching the site			0
earlier wednesday , @entity225 said soldiers were chasing rebels in the @entity240 neighborhood , causing ' great losses among them			1
' the @entity243 - based @entity242 said army helicopters attacked the neighborhoods of @entity246 and @entity247			0
stumbling block : @entity122 president @entity120 meets with @entity77 envoy @entity117 yesterday			0
@entity122 and @entity250 continue to the @entity82 regime by opposing @entity77 sanctions residents pray in front of the body of @entity258 , whom activists say was killed by forces loyal to @entity3 's president @entity82 the key stumbling block is the @entity262 demand for a resolution threatening non-military sanctions and tied to @entity209 of the @entity265 , which could eventually allow the use of force to end the conflict in @entity3			0
@entity122 is adamantly opposed to any mention of sanctions or chapter 7			0
after @entity187 consultations late tuesday on a revised draft resolution pushed by @entity118 , @entity122 's deputy @entity77 ambassador @entity274 said these remain ' red lines			0
' @entity122 has said it will veto any chapter 7 resolution , but council diplomats said there is still a possibility of last - minute negotiations			0
while facts on the ground often can not be verified because independent media are largely excluded from @entity3 , the conflict is now seen by observers to have changed from an uprising in poor towns and villages to a civil war that has reached the streets of the capital			0
it has also become a proxy war between @entity122 and @entity295 , which back @entity82 , one one side , and @entity299 powerhouse @entity297 , @entity192 and @entity300 , which are arming and funding the @entity299 rebels on the other			1
the rebels now include the @entity304 , a group of army defectors joined by @entity299 youths , @entity307 , the @entity308 , and local pro-democracy @entity299 liberals			1
weapons are being smuggled across the borders from @entity312 , @entity192 , @entity313 and @entity314			0
' @entity3 ... is clearly right now a battleground for proxy war between @entity297 and @entity317 , reflecting a centuries - old conflict between @entity295 and @entity299 powers , ' said @entity320 of political risk consultancy @entity321			1
while the rebels inside @entity3 are gaining ground , the @entity3 political opposition in exile remains bogged down in factional divisions and is losing influence			1
the government is meanwhile losing its ability to spread fear			0
defections of senior officers and officials have accelerated in recent weeks although the backbone of the military remains intact due to @entity337 solidarity			0
' the @entity3 regime is slowly and totally sinking			0
i do n't know what the timeline will be			0
it is becoming difficult for the state to control the country			0
it is like a fire engine , they extinguish one fire and find that another fire has started in another place , said a senior @entity262 diplomat			0
' the army is overstretched , the government is under sanctions and there is erosion of power , ' he added .			0

youngsters suffered appalling shrapnel wounds after their homes were shelled
rebels now include @entity307 style *jihadists* , the @entity308 , and local pro-democracy @entity299 liberals
