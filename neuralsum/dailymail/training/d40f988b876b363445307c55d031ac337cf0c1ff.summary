this time last year @entity0 was on the verge of something big			1
handed his senior @entity7 debut by @entity8 in october 2013 , the @entity5 winger scored a rasping shot from 25 yards against @entity10 which all but guaranteed the @entity7 ’ place at the @entity12			1
that strike against @entity10 was voted the fans ’ favourite of @entity7 ’s qualifying campaign			1
@entity0 scored with this rasping drive for @entity7 against @entity10 in october 2013 the winger was hailed by fans after his performance that helped @entity7 qualify for the @entity12 @entity0 ( centre ) missed out on @entity7 's @entity12 squad through injury 108 - minutes in the @entity23 234 - minutes in the @entity24 0 - goals 0 - assists ( @entity26 's only goal this season came for @entity7 against @entity28 ) he was a regular under then @entity5 boss @entity29 , a marauding presence on the wing , reminiscent of a certain @entity32 who ’d just moved to @entity33 for a record £ 87million			1
since then , his star has faded			0
an ankle injury hindered the 23 - year - old from ever reaching @entity39			0
and this season the regular outings at @entity41 have become numbered under @entity42			1
all of @entity0 's @entity23 appearances this season have come from the bench he was ruled out for 10 weeks with ligament damage less than two months before the @entity12 began and , with that dream shattered , his luck in north @entity47 has n’t improved since			1
@entity0 has become an unfortunate bit - part player for @entity5 , featuring for just 108 minutes in four @entity23 appearances , starting none			1
he has fallen down the pecking order at @entity41 with @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and now @entity57 preferred by @entity42			2
‘ hopefully , with a few more games in the @entity24 and the cup games , i might be ready to challenge for a @entity23 spot , ’ @entity0 says			2
more than a month has passed since he uttered those words , and the winger remains another young @entity64 player struggling to establish himself			0
it is not entirely dissimilar to the treatment of @entity7 under 21 striker @entity67			2
@entity42 does n’t fancy either in his @entity23 starting @entity68 , and so whets their appetites in the @entity70 and @entity24			1
the winger has had to settle for a starting berth in the cup competitions under @entity42 this season @entity0 is poised to take to that role once more in @entity75 on thursday evening when @entity5 face @entity76 in the @entity24 , and will be keen to score his first goal of the season for the club			1
the competition is arguably @entity42 ’s best chance of qualifying for the @entity82 , with the winner being gifted a place among football ’s elite next year			2
from playing in front of 84,000 fans at @entity88 to about 8,000 in @entity89 , though , can prove frustrating			0
last year he was battling with @entity91 and @entity92 for his right to be in the @entity7 team , now he is warming the bench most saturdays			2
@entity96 said in october 2013 : ‘ i never enjoyed it when he played on the right wing and i was at left - back ( in training )			1
‘ i was asking , “ @entity101 is this guy not playing every week , with this talent ? " ‘ i think @entity0 can be our new @entity32			0
’ the 23 - year - old started both @entity70 ties against @entity106 and @entity107 ( above ) @entity67 ( far right ) is another young @entity64 struggling to get @entity23 action for @entity5 he has not been able to settle at @entity41 , having been sent out on loan to nine different clubs since 2009			0
the man that impressed down the right flank in between injuries last year must be beginning to feel his 15 minutes of fame have been and gone			0
‘ i ’ve been out injured watching the @entity23 and seeing everyone doing well , ’ he said during a previous injury			0
‘ that just gives me an incentive to come back and to play even better than i was before			0
’ chance would be a fine thing for the @entity122 , and less than 30 minutes here and there in the @entity23 may not keep the still - young winger satisfied for long .			0

@entity0 made his @entity7 debut in october 2013
he scored against @entity10 to all but ensure @entity12 qualification
last season @entity0 was a regular in the @entity5 starting *xi*
but under @entity42 has found starts *harder* to come by
