by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 has warned rival clubs they have no chance of prising @entity7 from his grasp this month			1
the highly - rated 21 - year - old underlined his talent with both @entity3 goals in their season - opening 2 - 2 draw with @entity13 in the @entity14			1
the @entity16 striker caught the eye with nine goals last season and @entity20 is anticipating more this term			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity7 discussing his childhood as a refugee spot on : berahino scores the @entity3 equaliser from the spot to score the first goal under @entity2 leading the line : @entity7 celebrates his first goal in what could be an important season for him the downside to headline - grabbing performances is that other managers might be alerted to make a move before the end of the summer transfer deadline , but @entity20 is confident the club would not consider a sale			1
@entity2 said : ' i think everybody should know about him already , but i ca n't see any way this club would be interested in letting @entity7 go			2
you ca n't let top young @entity47 talented players go			0
' it could be a very big season for him			2
he is a terrific lad , he is very talented and he works very hard at his game			0
he is a pleasure to work with			0
' he has got a love for football and with the talent and professional attitude he has got , i think he could be a very good player for this season and beyond			1
' @entity2 himself is under pressure to hit the ground running at the @entity62 having been the club 's surprise choice as new head coach			2
here to stay : @entity2 insists that the young @entity47 is not for sale during this transfer window grabbing the attention : the striker enjoys scoring his second goal and putting @entity3 into the lead the @entity72 was @entity73 ' assistant for five years at @entity74 but his only previous spells as a manager , at @entity77 and @entity78 , were outside the top flight			1
his reign did not start well as @entity81 fired @entity13 ahead with a superb long - range strike after just five minutes			1
but the hosts then settled and deserved their equaliser before the break , although it came in fortuitous circumstances after the award of a contentious penalty			0
@entity89 was adjudged to have fouled @entity90 despite only minimal contact and even @entity2 admitted the decision was ' soft '			2
@entity7 struck from the spot and added a second after 74 minutes but @entity95 snatched a point for the @entity13 by rounding off a fine move five minutes from time			1
@entity2 said : ' the first game of the season is always special because you 've spent a long time working towards it			1
making progress : new signing @entity103 managed over an hour for @entity13 on his debut ' but it was special for me as well , to do it in the @entity14 was something different			1
the actual occasion was similar to a big game elsewhere			0
' record £ 10million signing @entity112 did not get off the bench			0
@entity2 said of the @entity114 : ' he 's been with us for a week			2
he is in good condition physically but i think it would be a big ask for him , physically and in understanding what we need him to do			0
' he is still getting to know the names of everyone			0
it is asking a lot to throw someone into a @entity14 game at that point			0
' the contest , between two of last season 's relegation battlers , was an entertaining affair			0
@entity13 boss @entity135 was pleased with the resilience of his side and saw marked improvement in their attitude			2
good attitude : @entity13 boss @entity135 praised his team 's response once they fell behind he said : ' last year , after conceding the second goal , maybe we would have collapsed and conceded three or four			1
' there is a little bit better , stronger mentality in the team			0
' if you see the reaction of the players on the pitch when we score and the celebration , coming back and trying to go again , i think it is a good sign for the future			2
' @entity135 gave a debut to his £ 10million midfielder , @entity103 , who is looking to rekindle the early promise he showed at @entity74 after two frustrating seasons at @entity162			1
the 23 - year - old played 68 minutes before being replaced by @entity164			1
@entity135 said : ' he started well and then we killed him for 20 minutes without the ball			0
we made him only defend , which of course is going to help us , but we need to give him the ball			0
' in the second half i was very pleased - ( it was ) the @entity103 we want to see , driving with the ball , getting to the edge of the box , winning ( the ball ) , turning , passing			1
' i was tempted to leave him on the pitch for a bit longer but i think it was enough and i think he will get better and better			0

@entity2 says @entity16 striker will be a good player ' this season and beyond '
@entity3 battled back from going an early goal down to lead 2 - 1
@entity13 equalised late on to share the points
