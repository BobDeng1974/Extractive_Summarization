by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 first minister @entity2 has been accused of ' trying to cover up ' expenses @entity3 first minister @entity5 has been accused of covering up a £ 3,000 expenses claim that paid for a four - night stay at a top @entity9 hotel			1
the five - star @entity10 has confirmed that the first minister booked one of its grand deluxe suites when he visited the city to promote @entity3 independence			1
the ‘ @entity19 ’ delegation were there to make a handful of speeches during the time of the @entity24 in 2012 , but the majority stayed in a more modest hotel near the @entity28 course , which charges £ 60 for a room			2
however mr @entity5 and his wife @entity30 chose a suite at the @entity10 – which is popular with such celebrities as @entity33 and @entity34 – even though it was much further away			1
he has consistently refused @entity36 requests to reveal how much he spent at the public ’s expense , dismissing criticism of the trip as ‘ ridiculous frippery ’			0
and deputy first minister @entity42 even claimed that she was ‘ flabbergasted ’ to be asked about the bill during a debate last week			0
but last night , after the hotel revealed how much he paid to stay at the luxury suite , mr @entity5 was facing new calls to ‘ come clean ’ about his use of public funds			1
his suite usually costs guests at least £ 1,164 per night			1
civil servants managed to get the room for $ 1,194 per night – £ 740 using the exchange rate at the time – because they also booked rooms for other members of the delegation at the same time			0
this meant that the bill for mr @entity5 ’s room alone would have come to nearly $ 5,000 , or £ 2,956 , for the four - night stay			1
and the delegation ’s total bill at the hotel was almost £ 10,000			0
the @entity10 has seven grand deluxe suites , which all have more than 1,000sq ft of floor space , a guest ‘ powder room ’ , a spacious living room , a dressing area and a surround - sound stereo system			1
mr @entity5 would have been treated to panoramic views of @entity74 and the city ’s historic @entity75			2
there are also three flat - screen televisions in each suite , mood lighting and @entity82 games consoles			0
last night opponents called for an investigation into his spending , with @entity88 ’s @entity87 saying : ‘ it is time for @entity5 to come clean about his @entity9 trip			2
mr @entity5 stayed here at the @entity10 in @entity9 on a recent trip to the city to promote @entity3 independence ‘ for a year and a half he has refused to say how much taxpayers ’ money he spent on himself			1
‘ now we know that he spent thousands on himself to stay in luxury at a five - star hotel			0
’ he added : ‘ there are still thousands of pounds not properly accounted for			0
everyone in @entity3 will be asking themselves what does @entity5 have to hide			0
‘ if he wo n’t come clean we need an @entity107 investigation into what he spent our money on			0
’ mr @entity5 previously charged the taxpayer more than £ 250 for a pair of tartan trousers on a visit to @entity114 – and then spent the next seven months attempting to hide his failure to pay the money back .			2
