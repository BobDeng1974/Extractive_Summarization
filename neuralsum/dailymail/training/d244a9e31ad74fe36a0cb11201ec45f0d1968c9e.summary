@entity0 has suffered one of its worst ever internet outages , just days after @entity3 warned of a ' proportional response ' to the @entity6 hacking			1
the @entity7 suggested on monday that @entity8 may be behind the virtual attack			0
very few people in the country have access to the internet , with connections often failing			2
however , the continuous problems reportedly being experienced led experts to raise the possibility that it might be under a cyber attack			1
' as the president said , we are considering a range of options in response , ' deputy spokeswoman @entity24 said			0
' we are n’t going to discuss , publicly , operational details about the possible response options — or comment on those types of reports in any way — except to say that as we implement those responses some will be seen , some may not be seen			0
' she added , ' so i ca n’t confirm those reports , but in general , that ’s what the president has spoken to			0
' for nine hours on monday , the hermit regime went completely offline			0
' it 's as if @entity0 got erased from the global map of the @entity63 , ' @entity59 , president of internet security company @entity60 , told @entity64			2
the outage followed president @entity3 's public shaming of @entity0 on friday after the @entity8 government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at @entity70 over the studio 's new film , @entity71 , which depicts the assassination of @entity0 leader @entity20			1
@entity74 , director of internet analysis at @entity76 , said the internet connectivity problems were discovered in the last 24 hours and had gotten progressively worse to the point that ' @entity0 's totally down			1
' internet connection was restored after nine hours on monday			2
@entity74 said one benign explanation for the problem might be that a router suffered a software glitch , though a cyber-attack involving @entity0 's internet service was also a possibility			1
' i have n't seen such a steady beat of routing instability and outages in @entity91 before , ' he told @entity92 ' usually there are isolated blips , not continuous connectivity problems			1
i would n't be surprised if they are absorbing some sort of attack presently			2
' the outage comes just days after president @entity3 's public shaming of @entity0 after the @entity8 government definitively determined that it was behind the hacking of computers at @entity70 although very few citizens in @entity0 have access to the internet , it allows the country 's state media to link to the outside world			1
the communist state 's internet access is wired through @entity113 , which today , in a foreign ministry statement , said it ' opposes cyber attacks and cyber terrorism in all of its forms , ' without referring directly to its ally @entity0			1
the instability is in @entity0 's main link , which runs through the northern @entity113 city of @entity127			0
@entity74 said this applied to @entity0 's main internet connection via @entity113 company @entity130 , although it was possible the country had limited connection via satellite			1
' all i can say is that in the last 24 hours , their communications have been degraded to a point where they are unable to communicate , ' he said			0
' they have disappeared from the global @entity63 presently			0
' @entity76 monitors internet performance though live feeds of router tables from about 450 telecommunications providers worldwide			0
@entity74 said @entity0 's internet connection has historically been stable , although it has come under attack in the past , including during a period of high tension with @entity148 in 2013			1
he said there were a lot of players - including potentially teenage hackers - who could mount a ' distributed denial - of - service ' cyber attack on @entity0 , if this were the cause of the outages			1
' it does n't need to be some big nation state , ' he added			0
another internet technology service , @entity160 , which protects companies against hacker attacks , said its monitoring had detected denial - of - service attacks aimed at @entity0 's infrastructure , which started on saturday and continued into today			2
such attacks transmit so much spurious data traffic to internet equipment that it becomes overwhelmed , until the attacks stop or the spurious traffic can be filtered and discarded to allow normal connections to resume			0
@entity173 has accused @entity174 of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused @entity6 executives to halt the debut of the comedy action film ' @entity71 ' it is not immediately clear if the connectivity problems were an act of retribution for the hack that the @entity186 last week linked to @entity0			1
distributed denial - of - service attacks are a relatively unsophisticated type of cyber warfare , in which a targeted computer system is bombarded with traffic , rendering it temporarily useless			0
asked about the internet problems , @entity0 diplomat @entity194 , said : ' i have no information			2
' @entity173 has accused @entity174 of being behind the hack that led to the release of embarrassing company emails and caused @entity6 executives to halt the debut of the @entity71			1
according to the @entity186 , there is ' significant overlap ' between the @entity70 attack and other ' malicious cyber-activity ' with direct links to @entity174 , including an attack last year on @entity148 banks blamed on the @entity0			1
the hackers behind the attack on @entity70 said they were incensed by the comedy , and the studio pulled the film from distribution after major @entity8 cinema chains declined to exhibit it			1
the film about a fictional @entity218 plot to kill the country 's leader infuriated @entity0 , although @entity174 has repeatedly denied it was behind the cyber assault			2
despite calls from @entity224 critics for a robust response to the alleged hack , @entity3 told @entity64 in an interview that aired on sunday : ' i do n't think it was an act of war			2
i think it was an act of cyber vandalism that was very costly , very expensive			0
we take it very seriously			0
' he also promised to ' review ' the @entity8 list of state sponsors of terrorism and potentially re-add @entity0 , but added : ' we 've got very clear criteria as to what it means for a state to sponsor terrorism			1
and we do n't make those judgments just based on the news of the day			0
' the @entity245 declined to comment today and @entity24 refused to confirm or deny that @entity0 had lost internet access because of a cyber attack			1
@entity0 has threatened to hit back at the @entity245 and other @entity8 targets if it was sanctioned over the alleged hacking			2
today @entity24 said of those threats : ' we have no specific credible threat information that leads credence to these reports			0
' ' obviously , we take very seriously any threats to @entity8 citizens , to @entity8 companies , regardless of what that threat looks like			0
' @entity0 's @entity261 , in a statement on the official news agency , said the country 's army and people ' are fully ready to stand in confrontation with the @entity8 in all war spaces including cyber warfare space to blow up those citadels			2
' meanwhile , @entity148 's @entity269 ( @entity270 ) began conducting drills at its four nuclear plant complexes today after a series of online information leaks by a suspected hacker			0
the hacker , using an account entitled ' president of the anti-nuclear reactor group ' , published a variety of information on @entity282 , including designs and manuals for two reactors as well as personal information on some 10,000 @entity270 employees			0
there did not appear to be any link between the drill and the @entity70 hack , and @entity0 says it has never attempted or made a cyber attack on @entity148 .			1

continuous problems could mean @entity0 was under cyber attack
*cybersecurity* expert says normal internet failings are ' isolated blips '
@entity74 says he ' would n't be surprised ' if country was attacked
outage comes after @entity3 said he would consider labelling @entity0 a state sponsor of terrorism
country has been accused of hacking film company @entity70
@entity309 led to release of comedy film @entity71 being *delayed*
*unclear* if the connectivity problems were an act of retribution for hack
@entity245 has declined to comment on connection outage
