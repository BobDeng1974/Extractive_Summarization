by @entity0 published : 05:20 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 20:30 est , 5 march 2013 @entity1 is up against it in his battle to block @entity5 plans to limit bonuses to a year 's salary @entity1 suffered a humiliating defeat in his bid to block a @entity5 - wide cap on bankers ’ bonuses yesterday – after finding himself outvoted by 26 to one			1
the chancellor had vowed to block @entity15 plans to prevent bankers being paid more than a year ’s salary in bonuses in most cases			1
arriving in @entity19 he declared : ‘ i can not support the proposal currently on the table			0
’ but hours later the @entity22 conceded ‘ a cap of some sort will happen ’			2
the climbdown came after the @entity15 ’s 26 other finance ministers made it clear they would not abandon the plan in the wake of the financial crisis			0
@entity31 has no veto and mr @entity1 was forced to accept a face - saving concession from @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 to undertake ‘ technical negotiations ’ over how the cap will work , in the hope of reaching ‘ consensus ’			1
the defeat is a significant blow to the @entity31 , which had argued a bonus cap would have a disproportionate impact on the @entity45			1
it will raise fresh concerns about @entity31 ’s ability to defend the @entity49 from a wave of financial regulations being plotted by @entity19			1
finance leaders fears the rules will drive away talent and restrict growth			0
employers ’ organisation the @entity58 reacted with dismay , saying : ‘ the proposals will damage the competitiveness of the @entity15 ’s financial services industry , hitting the @entity31 particularly hard , at a time when growth should be the key priority			2
’ @entity66 last week said @entity67 had ‘ real concerns ’ about the proposals , while @entity69 mayor @entity68 said the ‘ deluded ’ plan would simply drive top bankers overseas			2
yesterday mr @entity1 warned a cap on bonuses could result in banks pushing up salaries to top executives , which would be even harder to claw back in the event of failure			2
the chancellor fears capping bankers ' bonuses will lead to an exodus from the @entity45 to other financial centres , like @entity87 ‘ our concern is that it may have a perverse effect , it may undermine responsibility in the banking system rather than promote it , ’ he said			1
but @entity95 finance minister @entity94 said @entity15 ministers were in no mood to give way to @entity31 over the issue			1
@entity95 finance minister @entity94 warned @entity31 there is ' very little room ' to take account of @entity69 's concerns ‘ there is very little further that we can do for them ( the @entity31 ) , ’ he said			1
‘ there is n’t really any more room left			0
’ @entity110 ’s finance minister @entity109 said mr @entity1 would have to ‘ live with what is on the table ’ , adding : ‘ these moral rules apply to everyone , even the @entity49			0
’ @entity115 , the @entity15 commissioner for the single market , said excessive bonuses had fuelled risky behaviour by bankers , with dire consequences for taxpayers			0
we ’ve got to put a stop to that , ’ he said			0
the @entity15 plans , which are now set to come into force next year , will limit bonuses to 100 per cent of a banker ’s annual salary , or to 200 per cent if shareholders approve			1
the @entity22 last night insisted it still hoped to make the cap more ‘ flexible ’ , but conceded it could not now be blocked altogether			0
a spokesman said @entity31 would press for larger bonuses to be permitted on condition they were deferred for several years and / or paid in shares ‘ so that they can be clawed back ’			2
÷ the boss of scandal - hit @entity31 bank @entity140 lashed out at the plans to cap bonuses – while pocketing a £ 2million payout			1
chief executive @entity145 warned a crackdown would make its best staff an ‘ easy target ’ for rivals outside @entity5			0
@entity140 also claimed the £ 440million fine it was forced to pay for breaching sanctions against @entity151 , @entity152			0
@entity153 and the @entity154 was due to ‘ clerical errors ’ .			0

@entity31 *isolated* in *opposition* to plan to cap bonuses to a year 's salary
chancellor fears limits on payouts will lead to exodus from @entity45
@entity95 minister @entity94 says there is ' no room ' to accommodate @entity31 concerns
