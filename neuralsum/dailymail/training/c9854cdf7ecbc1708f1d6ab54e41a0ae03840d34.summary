the 20 - year - old has been earning rave reviews for his outstanding performances in the @entity4 midfield this season			1
in fact , his game has developed so quickly since leaving @entity8 that @entity9 are keen to put together a deal to bring the talented youngster to @entity12 this summer			1
here , @entity14 football writer @entity13 explains what all the fuss is about			2
so who is this guy i 'm hearing whispers about ? name : @entity22 : @entity23 : @entity24 : midfield / defence wanted man : @entity27 has been on such good form this season @entity9 are keen on signing the youngster i ’m going to need more than that ... can is one of the most versatile young players in the @entity34			1
having spent most of his career so far in the youth set up at @entity8 , the @entity39 - born player was one pipped for the top from an extremely early age			1
after only four first - team appearances at @entity8 , though , @entity43 's star faded during the 2012/13 season , and so in the summer of 2013 he chose to make the switch to @entity4			1
it has done him a world of good , and he has developed into an invaluable midfield force for his new club			0
he has also represented @entity51 at every level from under 15 to under 21			0
so why all the fuss ? the @entity14 - @entity55 star is not just on @entity9 's radar			1
when @entity8 sold him for £ 4.5million last summer , they were quick to ensure there would be a buy - back option in the deal			1
the @entity14 giants have a proud history of developing their own players , and for a long time it seemed can would become as much of a @entity8 regular as @entity67 , @entity68 or @entity69			1
should @entity9 manage to snap him up from @entity4 just one year into his four - year contract , it would be quite a coup : much to both @entity4 and @entity8 's disappointment			1
mature : despite being only 20 , the young @entity14 is credited with a calm head when the pressure mounts what ’s his style ? can prefers to play in central midfield - ' either attacking or defending , i do n't care either way ' - but has been employed as a centre - back and a left - back on various occasions			1
as captain of the @entity14 under 17s team , he was the calming influence at the heart of play			2
his physical strength is of particular use going forward , though he is rarely overly reckless			0
it has been remarked on several occasions that can seems to have a maturity beyond his years , and his technical ability as a playmaker , either from the back or the front , is now beyond doubt			0
so , a bit like ? the most commonly drawn comparison is @entity68			0
and not only because the young @entity27 puts as much effort into his hairstye as @entity68 once did			2
his ability to switch effortlessly from defence to midfield , his dangerous shot , and his control over the pace of the game all do remind one of the established @entity8 star			1
for those watching his marauding runs through the centre at @entity4 this season though , @entity115 has always also sprung to mind			1
it is little surprise that these two @entity8 stars have had an influence on can 's play			0
he has trained with them , or at least in close proximity to them , for several of his formative years			0
rise to prominence : can left @entity8 for @entity4 after failing to establish himself in the first team how much is he worth and what happens next ? @entity4 signed him on a four - year contract for £ 4.5million last summer , but his successful season has seen his value shoot up since then			1
@entity136 reported on monday that @entity9 would have to shell out at least £ 12million for him , though even that would undoubtedly be a sensible investment			0
his effect would not only be limited to himself , moreover			0
can was @entity9 academy striker @entity141 's captain in the @entity14 youth teams , and if the young striker were to return to fitness , @entity43 's presence may see him break through at @entity9			1
everyone has a weakness ... some questioned @entity43 's mentality after he failed to break into the @entity8 first team as quickly as predicted , despite public support from @entity152			2
that is a little unfair considering the wealth of talent @entity8 have in that position			0
there would be a similar fight for places at @entity9 , however , and it would be interesting to see how he rises to that challenge now			2
on the field ? there 's little to criticise , though by his own admission , he is not the greatest header of a ball			0
comparisons : can has been likened to @entity8 midfield stars @entity68 and @entity115 what happens next ? the likelihood of can joining @entity9 depends on which way you look at it			1
his agents at @entity177 have a good relationship with @entity179 and were allegedly instrumental in clinching the deals for @entity141 and @entity181 in the past			0
nonetheless , @entity4 will kick up a fight			2
squad manager @entity184 has stated that : ' we will do everything in our power to keep him			0
another year of development here is important for him , ' while director of sport @entity190 has denied any contact from @entity9 so far			2
most experts in @entity51 see little hope that @entity4 will hang onto him			0
the threat from former club @entity8 should n't be an issue this summer , as the buy - back clause can only be activated from 2015			2
anything else i need to know ? his surname is pronounced ' @entity203 ' , like @entity204			0
he also shares his full name with a @entity55 grand master of chess .			0

@entity9 are keen to bring the 20 - year - old to @entity12 this summer
young @entity14 left @entity8 in the summer of 2013 after failing to break into the first team
has since established himself in @entity4 midfield
@entity14 very *reluctant* to lose the player and say they will fight to keep him
can has been likened to @entity68 and @entity115
