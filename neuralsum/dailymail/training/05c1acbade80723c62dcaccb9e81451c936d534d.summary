it was carefully restored only two years ago and takes pride of place in a primary school ’s assembly hall			1
but now a mural featuring a golliwog is at the centre of a remarkable police investigation after a parent made an official complaint			1
@entity11 , 43 , contacted police , councillors and @entity14 after spotting the image during a visit to @entity17 in @entity18 , as she considered applying for a place for her son			1
the mural , which was painted in 1936 by @entity22 and features scenes from @entity24 across nine panels , features a golliwog she said she was astonished to see the mural , which was painted in 1936 by @entity22 and features scenes from @entity24 across nine panels			1
it was restored in 2011 with a £ 17,600 grant from the @entity30 ( @entity30 )			1
@entity31 is now investigating the ‘ hate incident ’ – with the @entity30 also reviewing the situation			1
council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city – but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons			2
mrs @entity11 said she found the image ‘ deeply offensive ’ and would now look for a different school for her son			2
she added : ‘ i raised it with the headteacher and she shrugged her shoulders and did n’t seem to think it was an issue			2
it ’s an inappropriate image for a primary school hall			2
‘ it ’s one thing if it was a museum piece or an exhibition , where you might explain what a swastika was or a @entity55 outfit			2
‘ it goes back to the @entity56 – the blacked - up face			2
’ council bosses have resisted pressure to remove or cover up the artwork at the school in the north of the city - but have introduced extra anti-racism lessons in the mural , the golliwog is sitting on an alcove ledge above the @entity24 figure in the central panel			1
the mural and @entity70 ’s distinctive architecture are well - known in academic circles			1
the school is part of the international @entity75 project set up to study the art and architecture of school buildings , funded by the @entity79			2
experts said they were unclear as to why the golliwog was included in the first place as it does not feature in @entity84 ’s story			1
they have speculated that it may have been added to promote @entity87 ’s jam , which used to feature a golliwog character named golly on its logo			1
a @entity31 spokesman said : ‘ police in @entity18 have received a complaint in relation to a mural at a primary school in the @entity98 area			1
officers are now liaising with the @entity101 ’s education department with regards to this matter			2
‘ @entity31 treats all reports relating to hate incidents extremely seriously and will thoroughly investigate whenever a report of this nature is made			0
’ the @entity30 admitted it was unlikely its staff had inspected the mural , since the grant was a small sum awarded under its fast - track scheme			1
@entity113 , head of @entity114 , said : ‘ @entity115 supported the restoration of a historic mural based on scenes from @entity84 ’s @entity24 at @entity17			1
‘ we will be discussing this issue with the school over the coming week			0
’ the council refused to consider covering up the image but said it would now use additional teaching packs at the school from campaign group @entity126			0
a spokesman insisted that the council and school take diversity and anti-racism extremely seriously			0
she said : ‘ the mural is of both historical and artistic importance			1
‘ while we understand the offensiveness of the image , it is in no way indicative of the attitudes of either the school or the council			0
‘ our equalities policies and approaches are robustly multicultural and anti-racist			0
’ @entity143 , a co-ordinator of the @entity75 project from the @entity145 , said : ‘ this is history			0
if you start painting it out or get rid of it you ’re deceiving people about what views were prevalent in the 1930s			0
‘ i think once children are being taught about issues of race , social issues and human rights – especially as they get to @entity160 6 or @entity161 – that could definitely be the time to introduce it			0
‘ it seems to me to be a perfect tool for that , saying that in the past the establishment did n’t even blink an eye at having this here , but we do now			0
’ councillor @entity171 said : ‘ i have seen this mural before and appreciate this is an awkward one			1
‘ i can understand people being offended given the subject matter			0
however , it ’s complicated by the fact it ’s a part of the history of the school			0
‘ i will raise this with parents			0
there is an argument for using it to educate pupils as to views of the past			0
then again , at primary age this might not be the most appropriate time			0
’ @entity191 of the @entity190 added : ‘ if a parent has expressed genuine concern over such an image , then clearly this needs to be reviewed			0
