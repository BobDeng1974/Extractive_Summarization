by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 7 november 2013 updated : 10:32 est , 7 november 2013 these eerie images show how a gothic manor which was abandoned by its occupants has become a timewarp after being neglected for 20 years			2
the mansion in @entity6 , near @entity7 , dubbed the ' doctor 's house ' by locals , is filled with old magazines , obsolete technology and vintage cars which are rusting away			1
its state rooms are falling apart , while the swimming pool is covered with moss			0
spooky : this manor house in @entity6 , near @entity7 , has been abandoned for nearly 20 years garage : this @entity21 and 1964 @entity22 are two of the five cars found abandoned on the property crumbling : a dust - covered copy of which car is one of many old magazines found lying around the house derelict : the state rooms such as this one are completely empty since the last owner departed in the 1990s the building , which is known as both ' @entity33 ' and ' @entity34 ' , is believed to have belonged to a notorious psychiatrist who once discharged a patient two days before she killed an 11 - year - old girl			1
@entity37 authorised the release of @entity39 from psychiatric care in april 1991 even though she had threatened a young girl with a knife and tried to strangle a medic			1
the 24 - year - old patient then randomly attacked schoolgirl @entity45 and stabbed her to death in a @entity7 shopping centre			1
an inquiry found that dr @entity37 had made ' a serious error of clinical judgement ' and he seems to have moved out of his @entity6 home soon afterwards , although he continued to practice at @entity52			1
grounds : the home is set in an extensive garden which looks overgrown and neglected ' doctor 's house ' : the home is believed to have been owned by @entity37 , a psychiatrist who in 1991 allowed @entity39 to leave hospital two days before she killed 11 - year - old @entity45 overgrown : the swimming pool , overlooked by animals painted on an outside wall , is now covered with a layer of moss rediscovered : a bottle of moutwash was sitting on the shelf when photographers @entity68 and @entity70 visited a hint at the house 's previous occupancy is provided by a crumbling copy of the journal advances in @entity76 which was found in the home			1
there are a number of magazines including copies of which car , a 40 - year - old issue of @entity84 and an edition of the now - defunct today newspaper from october 1991			1
the last occupant 's interest in cars is shown by the five vintage cars left in the garage and elsewhere on the property , including a @entity21 and a 1964 @entity93 a reminder of how long the home has been abandoned is provided by the discovery of a @entity98 tape , a format which went out of fashion nearly 30 years ago			0
rotting away : cars which could be very valuable if they had been kept in good condition are abandoned around the grounds hobby : it is clear that a former occupant of the home was a big fan of cars obsolete : a @entity98 tape was found at the manor even though the format has barely been used for the past 30 years ancient : a copy of @entity84 magazine from september 1973 was another old publication found there photographers @entity68 , 30 , and @entity70 , 36 , both from @entity7 , explored the derelict building which has been left open to the elements			1
' it was very eerie inside , the house was just abandoned , ' mr @entity68 said			2
' it looks as if time has stood still			0
it 's easy to imagine that the previous owner left his life behind to start again somewhere else			0
' there were five vintage cars at the property			0
we got the impression that the old study would have been beautiful before it was abandoned			0
papers had been thrown all over the place			0
catching up with the news : a copy of today , the now - defunct newspaper founded by @entity136 , dates back to october 1991 experience : the photographers said that the scene inside the house ' looks as if time has stood still			2
' stripped : some of the vehicles appeared to have had their most valuable parts removed scrap : the shell of another car with its seat , steering wheel and dashboard all stripped out ' there is a big swimming pool in the back but it 's now full of grass			2
the orangery was smashed to bits - there was glass all over the floor			0
' the @entity162 listed building dates from the early 19th century , although parts of the house are thought to be much older			0
it is not known who currently owns the abandoned home			0
@entity37 , a psychiatrist believed to have lived in the abandoned manor house at @entity6 , found notoriety after releasing @entity39 from hospital			1
the 24 - year - old had been subjected to a 28 - day detention order after threatening a young girl with a knife			1
however , half - way through the order , @entity39 's mother asked dr @entity37 to authorise her release from @entity52			1
two days later , @entity39 went to a @entity7 shopping centre and killed 11 - year - old @entity45 in a random knife attack			1
the killer admitted manslaughter and was ordered to be detained in a mental health unit indefinitely			0
the victim 's family sued the local health authority , and settled out of court for an undisclosed compensation payout			0
dr @entity37 was order to undergo additional training , but kept his job at the hospital			2
unused : it does not seem that any attempt has ever been made to renovate the manor house atmospheric : dozens of photographers have previously visited the house drawn by its eerie reputation book : the art of @entity203 was one volume left behind by the last owner			2

manor house in @entity6 , near @entity7 , is full of 20 - year - old magazines and obsolete technology
it is said to have been owned by psychiatrist @entity37 , who *recommended* release of killer @entity39 two days before she stabbed young girl to death
