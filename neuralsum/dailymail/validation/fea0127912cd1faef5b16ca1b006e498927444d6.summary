it used to be a landmark age when women crossed over from being youthful and desirable to being over-the - hill			1
but today turning 40 , is no longer a harbinger of middle age but for many it 's just another phase of our ever extending youth with all the anxieties of opportunities not taken and plans left undone			1
here three generations of women discuss how they felt about the big 4 - 0 , and how society 's view of women as they age has changed for the better over their lifetimes			1

the 39 - year - old says talking to her mother and grandmother about turning 40 has helped her feel less downhearted about ageing , going grey and being more critical of her appearance @entity23 , right , with her mother @entity32 and one - year - old daughter @entity22 the grandmother @entity35 , 87 , is retired and lives in @entity36 , @entity37 with her sister , @entity38 , 84			1
she says : ' back then , once a woman turned 40 she was expected to dress in a more subdued way , get a shorter haircut and generally become quite staid in appearance			1
' nowadays of course it seems like anything goes on the wardrobe front until you die - i see some old biddies these days who look ridiculous , showing off their scrawny legs in clothes meant for teenagers and coated in thick , gaudy make - up			0
' i 've always liked wearing tailored , comfortable clothes in flattering colours so my appearance has n't changed too much from birthday to birthday			1
' i do n't like the idea of getting older ; i do n't feel 87			2
but i 've always eaten carefully , kept active , travelled the world and spent quality time with my family and friends - and i have my health after getting cancer in my 50s - so instead of moaning about it i just feel very , very lucky i 'm still here			0
' my daughter @entity25 looks in the mirror and ca n't believe there 's an old woman staring back at her , but i 'm used to it so it 's not a shock for me any more			1
' as my granddaughter hits 40 , she should really be thinking " i 'm halfway done now , if i 'm lucky , so let 's enjoy this life ! " four generations together : from left to right , @entity32 , mum @entity35 and @entity23 with her son @entity79 , who 's now three the mother @entity32 , 65 , is retired and lives in @entity36 , @entity37 , with her husband @entity81 , 66			1
' i did n't want a big party for my 40th birthday , so my husband took me for a romantic weekend in a @entity85 , without the children , who were 14 , eight and two at the time			2
' but i was n't depressed			0
in fact i remember feeling happier than i ever had in my life			0
turning 40 coincided with a great sense of relief that my life was stable and on an even keel after a difficult first half			2
' in fact 40 was a great turning point for me , and it 's been good ever since			1
' the catchphrase at the time - on cards , badges and banners - was @entity102 , so i was quite surprised , as the big day loomed , how not elderly i felt			0
' when i was a teen , when someone turned 40 i considered them very much past it and on the verge of old age			1
but physically i looked and felt okay			0
' i had a big @entity110 perm and a penchant for shoulder pads and fuschia , but that was the style of the time			0
my daughter thinks i look better now			2
' in the 1980s , when i turned 40 , i was definitely the oldest mum at the school gates			1
the other fortysomethings waiting there were grandmas			0
@entity32 , now 65 , with her daughter @entity23 , who is about to turn 40 , on holiday in the @entity122 last year			1
@entity25 says that when she turned 40 in the 1980s , it felt like a new phase of her life was beginning , ' if you have good health and enough money to be comfortable , it can be a great phase of your life ' @entity32 , centre , aged 40 with her children , from left : @entity134 , @entity79 ( sitting on her lap ) and @entity23 ' but of course this is all different now , and my daughter @entity23 is not unusual that she is turning 40 with a one - year - old daughter			1
' having a daughter who is turning 40 is quite a milestone for me			1
in fact , it 's a bigger shock to the system than when i turned 40			1
' in my head i still feel about 38 , so to have a child of 40 is a startling reality check			2
but i 'm excited for her to reach this landmark age			0
' if you have good health and enough money to be comfortable , it can be a great phase of your life			0
in fact , in a way , life begins at 40			2
@entity32 holds her new granddaughter , @entity23 's second child @entity22 the daughter @entity162 , 39 , lives in @entity163 with her husband @entity164 and children @entity79 , three , and @entity22 , one			1
' my dad recently told me that 60 is the new 40 , so 40 must be the new 20			2
i think he was trying to cheer me up but i just thought " oh please no , i have n't got the energy to live my 20s again ! " ' but i think that has more to do with having two young children than the amount of candles i 'm about to blow out on my birthday cake			2
' it 's been very reassuring to talk to my mother and grandmother about turning 40 though because i have been surprised at how downhearted it 's made me feel			1
' i feel a real sense of loss , about things gone by , opportunities not taken			0
i feel like i get to turn a giant egg timer over once more and then that 's it			2
i 'm half way done			0
' but as my sensible grandma said to me " darling , the alternative to turning 40 is much worse so just get on with it			2
" @entity20 ( second from right ) , with her daughter @entity25 ( far left ) , sister @entity38 and granddaughter @entity23 ( far right ) says when she turned 40 in 1968 women were expected to dress conservatively and become quite staid in appearance with a shorter haircut , despite the women 's liberation movement sweeping across @entity195 ' i 've never paid much attention to my appearance but suddenly i 'm studying everything in cruel , minute detail			1
' in the last year i 've gone quite grey and i 've started to notice wrinkles and lines that i do n't think were there before			0
they may have been of course , but i just was n't looking for them			0
and i just do n't feel as bouncy			0
' my body definitely takes longer to recover after exercise , and that extra slice of pizza will now puff out the tummy that once stayed resolutely flat			0
' most of my friends have already turned 40 and i 've noticed the trend to throw parties as big as weddings in a giant celebration of yourself			1
' i love going to these things because you really see how far people have come			0
i normally get quite overwhelmed with emotion			0
' my mum said she thinks me and all my friends , many of whom she 's known for over 20 years , look better now than we ever have			0
i do n't think she 's just saying that			0
' i think along with added wrinkles , we 've added confidence - and certainly we 're making better make - up and hairstyle choices			0
