by @entity0 last updated at 7:07 pm on 29th february 2012 a futuristic supersonic weapon which fires ammunition up to 100 miles is another step closer to being deployed by the @entity4			1
officials have revealed an industry - built prototype of the electromagnetic railgun is now being tested at its @entity9 in northern @entity10			1
the weapon , which it is hoped will be fitted on ships from 2017 , uses a magnetic field and electric current , instead of chemicals , to generate energy to fire the rounds			1
scroll down to see video of testing ... sonic boom : an industry - built prototype of the electromagnetic railgun , seen here firing a projectile , is now being tested by the @entity4 explosive : the railgun can be seen flying through the air ( centre of left image ) and milliseconds after it was fired from the cannon ( right ) it will ultimately be used to target enemy ships , provide self - defence against cruise and ballistic missiles and offer support for @entity38 storming a beach			1
five - inch guns on destroyers currently have a range of just 15 miles			0
@entity4 officials said that they were currently focusing on making sure it can safely fire the rounds , which will reach seven times the speed of sound - a staggering 5,600mph			2
they added that more research and development would be needed over the next five years to ensure the weapon can cool down , handle repetitive fire and ensure the 40lb metal projectiles do not disintegrate			0
@entity53 , the @entity55 's electromagnetic railgun program manager , said : ' as you can see , it represents a significant increase in range			0
' loading up : the weapon , which it is hoped will be fitted on ships from 2017 , uses a magnetic field and electric current , instead of chemicals , to generate energy to fire the rounds charged : it will ultimately be used to target enemy ships , provide self - defence against cruise and ballistic missiles and offer support for @entity38 storming a beach he added that , because the gun can fire at such high speeds , it would not necessarily have to shoot an explosive to inflict damage			1
he would only say that it would carry a ' lethal mechanism '			0
the @entity4 has been developing the weapon since 2005 at a cost of about $ 240 million			2
similar funding is expected to keep the programme until 2017 , when the @entity4 anticipates the weapon will be ready			2
but it could still take several more years before the gun is put on all ships			0
monitor : @entity4 officials said that they were currently focusing on making sure it can safely fire the rounds , which will reach seven times the speed of sound - a staggering 5,600mph the 40ft - long gun being tested more closely mirrors a final product than previous versions			1
it has been test fired six times since last week			0
a second industry - built prototype will be delivered to the @entity4 for testing in april			1
@entity105 , one of the companies providing a prototype , has also invested $ 20 million			0
@entity109 , director of the firm 's railgun programme said : ' we believe this is definitely a game changing capability that 'll enable our forward presence and freedom of the seas			0
