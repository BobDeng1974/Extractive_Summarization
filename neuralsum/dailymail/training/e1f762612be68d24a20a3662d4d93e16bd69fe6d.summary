correctional institutions across the @entity2 are bursting at the seams with more than two million americans behind bars			0
the worst hit state , @entity12 , houses 140,000 inmates when its 33 adult prisons are only designed to hold a maximum of 80,000			1
overall , the @entity16 is around 39 per cent over ' rated capacity ' - their highest level since 2004 - with that figure expected to soar to 45 per cent above its limit by 2018			1
the @entity28 has ordered @entity12 to release more than 30,000 inmates over the next two years an inmate stands in his overcrowded cell at the @entity33 jail in @entity34 , @entity12			2
the state 's prisons are so overcrowded that they are said to provide inadequate mental and health care hundreds of prisoners at the @entity39 in @entity40 , @entity12 are also housed in makeshift living quarters in the prison 's gymnasium one inmate is forced to sleep next to phones where fellow prisoners make phone calls home at the @entity33 jail the @entity39 in @entity40 , pictured , is another of those drastically overstretched by increased prisoner numbers so bad is the situation in @entity12 that the @entity28 has slapped an order on the state ruling that 30,000 prisoners must be released by the middle of next year , labelling overcrowded conditions in its jails as ' unconstitutional '			1
the prison system has seen a stream of new offenders in the past five years and is still massively overstretched despite extra space being added			2
wardens and experts now fear that increased overcrowding and an increasing lack of privacy for inmates will see them more prone to lashing out and causing trouble			0
many prisons have had to create makeshift living quarters for detainees in public spaces such as gymnasiums , with some inmates having to sleep in bunks of three , while some cells which are only designed to house one person are home to up to three			0
inmates are being allowed less time in communal areas such as the cafeteria , tv rooms and recreation yards			0
the country is streets ahead of the rest of the world in terms of the number of prisoners per 100,000 population , with @entity92 the second highest and @entity93 in third			0

prisons have had to reduce the amount of time that inmates are spending in public spaces such as the cafeteria or the exercise yard , pictured a makeshift living space for prisoners doubles up as a recreation area at this prison in @entity27 , @entity12 , with a group of inmates using the bed as a poker table prisoners at the @entity113 in @entity114 , seem unfazed despite having to bunk in threes , but the @entity28 disagrees ruling that such overcrowding is ' unconstitutional ' it is feared that prisoners living in such proximity as those pictured could lead to clashes and violence between inmates behind bars this prison , the @entity113 in @entity114 , which houses murderers , child molesters , thieves and other criminals , is one of the most overcrowded in @entity12			1
some inmates have to share triple bunk beds in large public areas ( pictured ) a rare moment of solitude for this inmate at the overcrowded @entity33 jail in @entity34 , @entity12			2
prisons in the @entity2 are their most stretched in terms of capacity since 2004 with the @entity2 prison system bursting at the seams , these inmates have their work cut trying to sort the ever growing piles of laundry caused by increasing inmate numbers this inmate talks on the phone to a loved one in a crowded gymnasium area at a @entity12 prison , but he could soon be back at home with his family with shortened sentences one possible way to cope with unprecedented release numbers wardens warn that less time in recreational areas such as this yard at a @entity12 jail coupled with an increased lack of privacy for prisoners could lead more inmates to lash out this prisoner in @entity27 tries to make the most of the relative open space of the exercise yard , but is still surrounded by fellow convicts this tattooed prisoner at the @entity26 state prison in @entity27 makes the most of stretching out , but the picture shows how close together the beds are inmates are literally living on top of each other as this picture shows , but it could get worse as @entity2 prisons are expected to swell to 41 per cent above maximum levels by 2018 an inmate looks out from his cell in @entity27 , @entity12 - many such prisons have two or three detainees living in a single room designed for one an inmate waits for a visitor at the @entity26 state prison in @entity27 the left hand table shows the increase in prisoner numbers in the @entity2 between 2000 and 2010 while the right hand chart shows that the @entity2 is streets ahead of the rest of the world in terms of the number of prisoners per 100,000 population			1
