the @entity1 has identified five men who might be responsible for the attack on the diplomatic mission in @entity5 , @entity6 , last year , and has enough evidence to justify seizing them by military force as suspected terrorists , officials say			1
but there is n't enough proof to try them in a @entity1 civilian court as the @entity15 administration prefers			2
the men remain at large while the @entity17 gathers evidence			2
but the investigation has been slowed by the reduced @entity1 intelligence presence in the region since the september 11 , 2012 , attacks , and by the limited ability to assist by @entity6 's post-revolutionary law enforcement and intelligence agencies , which are still in their infancy since the overthrow of dictator @entity27			1
the decision not to seize the men militarily underscores the @entity31 aim to move away from hunting terrorists as enemy combatants and holding them at the military prison in @entity35 , @entity36			0
using military force to detain the men might also harm fledgling relations with @entity6 and other @entity55 governments with whom the @entity1 is trying to build partnerships to hunt @entity58 as the organization expands throughout the region			1
a senior administration official said the @entity17 has identified a number of individuals that it believes have information or may have been involved , and is considering options to bring those responsible to justice			2
but taking action in remote eastern @entity6 would be difficult			0
@entity1 's relationship with @entity6 would be weighed as part of those options , the official said , speaking only on condition of anonymity because the official was not authorized to discuss the effort publicly			1
the @entity6 embassy did not respond to multiple requests for comment			0
waiting to prosecute suspects instead of grabbing them now could add to the political weight the @entity5 case already carries			0
wanted : this is one of the five suspects the @entity17 was seeking for questioning in relation to the deadly attack on the @entity1 consulate in @entity5 , @entity6 on september 11 , 2012			1
the men are now identified killed : ambassador @entity87 ( left ) died of smoke inhalation , while agent @entity89 ( right ) died in a desperate battle with insurgents heroic : former @entity92 ( left ) and @entity93 ( right ) were killed in a mortar attack the attack on the @entity1 diplomatic mission killed ambassador @entity87 and three other @entity1 - information management officer @entity89 , and former @entity92 and @entity93 - weeks before president @entity15 's re-election			1
since then , @entity98 in @entity99 have condemned the administration 's handling of the situation , criticizing the level of embassy security , questioning the talking points provided to @entity107 ambassador @entity106 for her public appearances to explain the attack and suggesting the @entity31 tried to play down the incident to minimize its effect on the president 's campaign			0
the @entity17 released photos of three of the five suspects earlier this month , asking the public to provide more information on the men pictured			1
the images were captured by security cameras at the @entity1 diplomatic post during the attack , but it took weeks for the @entity17 to see and study them			1
it took the agency three weeks to get to @entity6 because of security problems , so @entity6 officials had to get the cameras and send them to @entity1 officials in @entity131 , the capital			2
the @entity17 and other @entity1 intelligence agencies identified the men through contacts in @entity6 and by monitoring their communications			1
they are thought to be members of @entity137 , the @entity6 militia group whose fighters were seen near the @entity1 diplomatic facility prior to the violence			2
person of interest : this is one of five men wanted for questioning in connection to the attack on the @entity1 mission in @entity5 dangerous : each of the men in the photos appear to be armed @entity98 lawmakers continue to call for the @entity15 administration to provide more information about the attack			2
the @entity31 released 99 pages of emails about the talking points drafted by the intelligence community that @entity158 used to describe the attack , initially suggesting they were part of a series of regional protests about an @entity165 film			0
in those emails , administration officials agreed to remove from the talking points all mentions of terror groups such as @entity137 or @entity58 , because the intelligence pointing to those groups ' involvement was still unclear and because some officials did n't want to give @entity99 ammunition to criticize the administration			0
@entity1 officials say the @entity17 has proof that the five men were either at the scene of the first attack or somehow involved because of intercepts of at least one of them bragging about taking part			1
some of the men have also been in contact with a network of well - known regional @entity184 , including @entity185			0
the @entity1 has decided that the evidence it has now would be enough for a military operation to seize the men for questioning , but not enough for a civilian arrest or a drone strike against them , the officials said			0
the @entity1 has kept them under surveillance , mostly by electronic means			0
burning issue : ambassador @entity87 and three other @entity1 were killed in a six - hour , commando - style attack on the consulate in @entity5 there was a worry that the men could get spooked and hide , but so far , not even the @entity17 's release of surveillance video stills has done that			1
@entity17 investigators are hoping for more evidence , such as other video of the attack that might show the suspects in the act of setting the fires that ultimately killed the ambassador and his communications specialist , or firing the mortars hours later at the @entity217 base where the surviving diplomats took shelter - or a @entity6 witness willing to testify against the suspects in a @entity1 courtroom			1
but @entity222 , the @entity98 chairman of the @entity223 , said he is concerned the @entity15 administration is treating terrorism as criminal actions instead of acts of war that would elicit a much harsher response from the @entity1			0
' the war on terror , i think , is a war and at times i get the feeling that the administration wants to treat it as a crime , ' @entity222 said tuesday			0
administration officials have indicated recently that the @entity17 is zeroing in			0
tragedy : @entity87 ( pictured in april 2011 ) became the @entity1 ambassador to @entity6 in june 2012			1
he was killed along with three other @entity1 in an attack on the @entity1 @entity238 in @entity5 on sept. 11 , 2012 ' regardless of what happened previously , we have made very , very , very substantial progress in that investigation , ' attorney general @entity239 told lawmakers last week			1
that echoed comments made by secretary of state @entity247 to lawmakers last month			0
' they do have people @entity250 'd , ' @entity247 said of the @entity17 - led investigation			0
' they have made some progress			0
they have a number of suspects who are persons of interest that they are pursuing in this and building cases on			0
' but options for dealing with the men are few and difficult , @entity1 officials said , describing high level strategy debates among @entity31 , @entity17 and other counterterror officials			2
those confidential discussions were described on condition of anonymity by four senior @entity1 officials briefed on the investigation into the attack			2
the @entity1 could ask @entity6 to arrest the suspects , hoping that @entity1 would be given access to question them and that the @entity6 gather enough evidence to hold the men under their own justice system			1
another option is to ask the @entity6 to extradite the men to the @entity1 , but that would require the @entity1 to gather enough solid evidence linking the suspects to the crime to ask for such an action .			1

each of the suspects identified by the @entity17 were seen on the grounds of the consulate during the deadly attack on september 11 , 2012
they all appear to be holding guns in photos released by the bureau earlier this month
four @entity1 were killed in the attack , including @entity1 ambassador to @entity6 @entity87 , @entity89 , @entity298 and @entity93
