after the case sgt @entity238 of @entity239 said : ' having spoken with many of the victims in this case it appears that @entity9 is a charming and charismatic individual who was able to call on his previous football experience and the fact he bears some resemblance to the real @entity4 to deceive them			2
' he was able to trick most people he came across and grew in confidence the longer the charade continued			0
he became so skilled in lies and deceit that his character went from being plausible to unquestionable			0
@entity9 was caught after trying to buy £ 20,000 worth of goods at @entity175 in the @entity62 ( pictured ) @entity9 gave the store his card details over the phone , but just as a chauffeur was sent to collect the items , store security became suspicious and withheld the items ' @entity9 told us that many of his victims treated him so differently because they thought he was a celebrity footballer			1
unfortunately this trust and goodwill was misplaced			0
' while i have some sympathy for the way his career was curtailed , there can be no excuses for the persistent and deliberate frauds that have left numerous people and businesses out of pocket			0

' i hope more businesses are now aware of this scam and have the necessary security measures in place to prevent similar occurrences			0
