@entity0 will be out of action until ‘ early 2015 ’ with a shoulder ligament problem which will require surgery and a lengthy recovery period			1
@entity6 ’s premier no 1 will miss the autumn series against @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 and may face a mad dash to prove he is ready for the @entity13			1
as he contemplates another prolonged injury lay - off , the 26 - year - old @entity15 prop must wonder whether he will ever escape the cyclical spectre of damage , surgery and rehab			1
@entity0 , charging forward against @entity20 on saturday , is out until early 2015 with a shoulder injury the @entity6 prop needs surgery and faces a long recovery period in yet another set - back to his career @entity0 will miss tests against @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 and maybe the @entity13 @entity28 lock @entity27 has also been ruled out of the november matches but he has been available for long periods since emerging as a test player , whereas the same can not be said for @entity0			1
it is a testament to his rare talent as an accomplished scrummager and mobile forward that @entity36 made it to @entity11 last summer and had a major hand in a @entity40 series triumph — starting and excelling in two tests			0
his troublesome knees had so nearly denied him that honour , only for an injury to @entity45 ’s @entity44 to open the door			2
sadly , @entity0 has played just 19 of 40 possible internationals for @entity6 since making his test debut in february , 2011			1
there has been a solitary appearance for his country in the past 22 months , as his knees have required frequent medical intervention			0
now , having missed the summer tour of @entity8 in order to ensure he tackled this season in peak condition , this latest harsh twist of fate consigns him to another long absence			1
while this is an unrelated issue - a different joint - the figures point to a persistent problem in terms of withstanding life at the sharp end of his brutal profession			1
@entity0 played nine times for @entity15 last season , following his transfer from @entity72			1
in six full seasons in the @entity74 he has started a mere 33 games - no more than six in any one season			1
when he left the @entity78 , their director of rugby , @entity77 , claimed his knee problems were ‘ degenerative ’			2
@entity27 ( right ) is another member of @entity82 's @entity6 squad suffering from injury problems @entity27 receives treatment during @entity28 's game against @entity20 last week @entity86 ( @entity87 , full back ) : sore ribs			1
@entity90 ( @entity28 , prop ) : neck surgery			0
return : late november @entity0 ( @entity15 , prop ) : shoulder surgery			1
return : ‘ early 2015 ’			0
@entity95 ( @entity96 , fly - half ) : hamstring strain			2
@entity27 ( @entity28 , lock ) : persistent concussions			2
@entity101 ( @entity28 , lock ) : knee ligaments			2
@entity104 ( @entity28 , centre ) : @entity107 injury			2
return : weekend after next			0
@entity108 ( @entity96 , prop ) : knee surgery			2
@entity111 ( @entity20 , wing ) : foot injury			1
@entity114 ( @entity15 , flanker ) : back injury			1
return : 1 - 2 weeks			0
@entity117 ( @entity28 , hooker ) : shoulder operation			0
the player himself is well aware that @entity122 has established himself as a pedigree test performer and that @entity108 , while also likely to miss the autumn matches , is another high - class alternative			0
no wonder @entity0 recently explained that his priority is simply to play , saying : ‘ my main goal for this season is to stay healthy , stay fit , keep playing and build back my old form and keep improving			1
i ’m in as good a shape as i ’ve ever been			0
’ unfortunately , that positive state was shattered by a collision during saturday ’s home win over @entity20			1
a statement issued by @entity15 on tuesday read : ‘ @entity0 has sustained a ligament tear to his shoulder that will keep the @entity6 prop out of action until early 2015			1
‘ the specialist ’s advice is that the tear needs surgical repair so that he can play to an optimum level in the future			0
’ meanwhile , @entity28 confirmed that @entity27 will take an enforced rest in an attempt to alleviate his recurring concussion problems			1
‘ he saw the relevant specialist this week and will have time out of the game now , ’ said @entity151 , the @entity28 ’ director of rugby			0
@entity104 ( in action for @entity6 against @entity8 ) is recovering from a groin injury ‘ he ’ll probably be another couple of months out - probably three or four weeks of complete down time and then he ’ll be reintegrated into training			2
you ’d like to think that by december he ’ll be playing again			0
and there ’s no doubt about that , he will play again			0
’ on a brighter note , @entity151 insisted that @entity104 ’s groin injury is not serious , even though it will keep him out of saturday ’s trip to @entity166			2
‘ he ’s improving well but he ’s not quite where he needs to be , ’ he said			0
‘ we find that most of the @entity170 boys heal quite slowly			0
@entity104 ’s brothers were exactly the same			0
the @entity173 gene is big , quick and nasty , but slow healers			0
when they ’re fit they ’re dangerous , but when they ’re injured they slow down ! ’			0
