' on this specific issue of stamp duty avoidance , rich people - often foreigners who come to this country but also people here in @entity83 - who put homes into companies to avoid stamp duty , that is completely unacceptable and we are going to come down on that practice like a tonne of bricks			1
' we are going to be extremely aggressive in dealing with it and people are going to face a very punitive charge			0
