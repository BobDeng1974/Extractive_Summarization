@entity0 sharing a cigarette with @entity2 in 1975			2
this was the first occasion the pair - who had an ' amorous friendship ' - had met @entity0 was a sex fanatic who became obsessed with bedding as many partners - men or women - as possible , a new book claims			1
@entity0 's colourful , gender - bending sex life has included rumored relationships with @entity2 and @entity15 as well as ones - which the women have themselves confirmed - with @entity18 and @entity19			1
but he has also been linked with a string of men including @entity23 - rumours that were encouraged by @entity0 's past claims to have been both gay and bi-sexual			1
in a new book , @entity0 , author @entity26 spoke to the singer 's friends , ex-lovers , business associates and industry insiders to ask whether he was a sex addict or a show business star who was keen to make himself seem more exciting to fans			1
nowadays , @entity0 , 67 , is a father and lives in conventional matrimony with his @entity39 supermodel second wife , @entity37			1
however , according to extracts of the new book published in the @entity42 , @entity26 believes that @entity0 was only ready to settle down after satisfying a voracious sexual appetite			1
@entity26 describes how @entity0 and his first wife , @entity47 , ‘ were notorious about weaving a sexual web around those who took their fancy ’ and met while they were having an affair with the same man			1
@entity0 , born in @entity51 and raised in modest circumstances in the @entity54 suburb of @entity55 , was determined to break into @entity54 ’s music scene			2
according to @entity26 he became ‘ adept at playing @entity54 ’s gay elite ’			2
a @entity0 acquaintance from those years put it more bluntly , saying : ‘ i said he would either be a gigantic star or make a lot of money in the @entity65 men ’s loo			2
but according to @entity26 , @entity72 could n't stand @entity0 and helped him only because he feared losing @entity47 if he did n't , says @entity26			1
but @entity47 - who has been credited with playing an instrumental role in moulding @entity0 's flamboyant images in his heyday - was desperately keen to become the girlfriend of an emerging rock star			1
in 1969 - the year of his first hit song @entity83 helped @entity0 move into a crumbling mansion , @entity85 in @entity55			2
there she catered to his every need , treating him as ‘ a pampered prince ’ and even running him a bath every morning			0
according to @entity26 , @entity90 - born @entity47 had an ‘ uncanny ability to bring home the most free - spirited girls ’			1
they were n't ready just to hop into bed with the bisexual couple but even with others visiting the house , she says			0
the couple married and had a son named @entity101 - derived from the @entity103 word for life - on may 30 , 1970			0
when he met @entity37 at a party in 1990 , @entity0 revealed : ' i was naming the children the night we met ' at the same time , @entity0 and @entity47 were working together on his next on - stage and recording persona , the sexually - ambiguous @entity108			1
@entity0 insisted to an interviewer at the time that ‘ i ’m gay and always have been '			2
a former member of staff at @entity0 's record company told @entity26 that @entity0 had bedded pretty much everyone who worked there , sometimes repeatedly			1
but at least one of @entity0 ’s male lovers wondered whether @entity0 was actually gay or bisexual - or hankering for attention			2
the book examines the question whether @entity0 was merely a sexual adventurer or an actual sex addict ‘ when we were in bed together , he was more sensual and narcissistic , ’ said @entity121 , @entity0 ’s ex-assistant			1
‘ to him , it was about being adored ... i do n’t think sex mattered to him			0
’ on a @entity90 tour in 1972 , @entity47 started a relationship with her husband ’s @entity130 bodyguard			2
but , says @entity26 , mrs @entity132 would also join her husband for threesomes with any of the groupies - male or female - who crowded around him			0
in their new @entity54 home in @entity140 , @entity47 attempted to enclose her wayward husband in a ‘ sexual cocoon ’ that kept him close to her while allowing him to indulge his appetites for other sexual partners			2
their home in @entity147 boasted what they called ' the pit ' , a four - foot - deep bed covered in fur in the living room , where they would entertain guests			0
‘ @entity47 and @entity0 used to have the most amazing orgies at @entity158 f * * * * d everybody in the pit			1
@entity23 used to come there and be involved with sexual things , ’ a source told @entity26			1
as @entity0 spiralled into a cocaine addiction and became painfully thin , the drugs fuelled his sex drive and he became ‘ dedicated to having sex with as many partners as possible ’ , says @entity26			1
@entity0 has himself admitted as much , once telling a @entity168 interviewer : ' i was hitting on everybody			0
i had a wonderfully irresponsible , promiscuous time			0
' while the singer 's relationship with @entity47 was never mutually exclusive , she reveals that she felt more comfortable about some of his lovers than others			0
and so while @entity18 had been part of their orgy - pit scene , she was suspicious about his relationship with @entity15 and was upset to see them photographed together shortly after her marriage to @entity23 ended			0
to her , the former @entity70 wife represented a serious threat to their marriage			0
as for @entity15 's ex-husband , @entity47 famously claims she once found @entity23 and @entity0 naked in bed together			1
@entity0 is currently a stay - at - home dad and is so rarely in the public eye now that some call him a recluse although an ageing @entity2 - 15 years his senior - was rumoured to be one of @entity0 's most famous conquests , @entity26 merely describes their relationship as ‘ an amorous friendship ’			1
she was n't the only older woman with whom he was linked			0
@entity0 was rumoured to have started an affair with @entity202 , widow of @entity203 and 20 years older than him , when he was playing @entity204 on stage in 1980			2
@entity26 also describes how the guitarist @entity206 was just eight - years - old when he walked into a room at home and found @entity0 naked with his mother , @entity209			1
@entity211 singer @entity210 , ex-wife of record producer @entity213 , recalled how she was taken to see him after he performed in @entity214 in 1976			0
she was led directly to his hotel suite where he was waiting for her , naked			0
in the late 1970s , @entity0 began denying that he had ever been gay or bisexual , insisting it was an image concocted by his managers			0
his affair with actress @entity19 which lasted three years , after a daliance @entity202 - widow of @entity220 - who was almost 20 years older than @entity0			0
@entity0 , who split up with @entity47 in 1980 , has admitted he has an addictive personality and @entity26 speculates whether it applied not only to drugs but also to sex			1
if so , he shook the habit			0
he certainly seemed to have slowed down considerably in the bedroom department by the time he met @entity37 at a party in @entity228 in 1990			0
he said later : ‘ i was naming the children the night we met			0
‘ it was so lucky that we were to meet at that time in our lives , when we both were yearning for each other			0
