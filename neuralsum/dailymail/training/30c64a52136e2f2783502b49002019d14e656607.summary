an elderly farmer who had his ribcage shattered by a two - tonne bull has made an amazing recovery thanks to pioneering ‘ @entity5 ’ surgery			1
@entity6 , 70 , was left breathless and in agony after his prized @entity8 repeatedly charged into his chest and pummelled him on the ground on a hillside at @entity12 , near @entity13 , @entity14			1
the grandfather sustained life - threatening injuries including 11 broken ribs , a dislocated shoulder , a punctured lung , torn ligaments and a dislocated sternum			1
he only survived because his nine - year - old grandson @entity22 saw the attack and ran half a mile to find help			1
@entity6 , 70 , suffered life - threatening injuries when he was attacked by his two - tonne bull mr @entity6 only survived because his grandson , @entity28 ( pictured with dogs , @entity30 and @entity31 ) ran half a mile to find help as a result of the attack , which took place in october 2011 , he was forced to retire and sell his prize herd			1
however , after pioneering surgery to rebuild his ribcage using plates and screws at the @entity42 , he is now able to breathe properly again			1
the new technique sees tailor made surgical plates pinned to the broken bones to alleviate pain and speed up recovery			2
it can allow patients to escape complications such as pneumonia , breathing difficulties and chest deformity and has a recovery time of just a few days			0
until recently , the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed			2
this could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such as breathing difficulties , pneumonia and chest deformity			0
mr @entity6 had been bringing his herd in for winter when the @entity68 blue bull attacked him			1
during the attack mr @entity6 sustained 11 broken ribs he said : ‘ he crushed my chest ; i could feel my bones breaking			1
he tossed me about ten feet in the air			0
‘ eventually he threw me behind a stone wall , i thought i was dying			0
’ fortunately , his nine - year - old grandson @entity28 saw the attack and raised the alarm			1
but the bull refused to move until the downdraft from the air ambulance 's rotors forced it away			2
@entity22 ran half a mile back to the family farmhouse and flagged down part - time farm worker @entity84 , who called for help			1
‘ my granddad called me to stay with him but i knew he needed help so i ran as fast as i could , ’ said @entity22			0
mr @entity6 was airlifted to the @entity90 where his injuries prompted a transfer to the cardiac care and intensive care unit at @entity42			1
@entity95 , mr @entity96 ( left ) , repaired mr @entity6 's ribs using plates and screws the surgeon likened the procedure ( demonstrated in theory in the image ) to using @entity5 surgeons said he was extremely lucky to have survived the attack			1
‘ my lungs were filling up fast with fluid and i could hardly breathe , ’ said mr @entity6			1
‘ they just got to me in time			0
’ mr @entity6 has nothing but praise for the cardiothoracic surgeon who operated on him			1
‘ the procedure mr @entity96 carried out on me was grand			0
i 'm getting a lot better and it has improved the quality of my life , ’ he said			0
‘ i still get out of breath at times , but i can do so much more than i could			0
‘ i can saw wood and hammer in nails , i even built a shed recently and can take walks again in the fells			0
’ he added : ‘ i retired after the accident because i could n't carry on with the work and sold all the cattle ‘ i had planned to carry on farming for a little longer , but it was n't possible after the attack , but now i feel quite well and i could start again - but i do n't think my wife would let me ! ’ following the surgery the ' @entity5 ' plates and screws are visible on an x-ray of mr @entity6 's chest his surgeon , mr @entity96 , said that pain would have been ' part and parcel ' of mr @entity6 's life without the surgery , flaring up every time he moved			1
however , after the surgery , which ' screwed ' the ribs back into place , he felt the pain relief almost immediately			2
mr @entity96 said : ‘ if the ribs are unstable the patient can not breathe properly			2
the fixator , called a @entity149 , guarantees stability			0
it allows the patient to breathe and reduces the pain level			0
’ likening the procedure to a ' @entity5 ' set , he added : ‘ we now have the technology to stabilise fractures , pulling the ribs back into place using plates which are attached to the bone with screws			1
’ until recently , the only treatment for broken ribs was to strap them up and take painkillers until they had healed			2
this could take months and left the patient in danger of complications such as breathing difficulties , pneumonia and chest deformity			0
the new technique , @entity149 , sees patients undergo a 2 hour operation which is available both on the @entity178 and privately			0
during the surgery , tailor made plates are pinned to the broken bones to speed up recovery and alleviate pain			2
each plate is about half an inch wide and is shaped to match the contours of the ribs			2
the recovery time from the operation is only a few days			0
the plates are left in the body for the rest of the patient 's life .			0

@entity6 was attacked by his bull in a field near @entity13 , @entity14
broke 11 ribs , dislocated a shoulder and his sternum and punctured a lung
his nine - year - old grandson saved him by running half a mile to find help
he has now recovered following ' @entity5 ' surgery using plates and screws
