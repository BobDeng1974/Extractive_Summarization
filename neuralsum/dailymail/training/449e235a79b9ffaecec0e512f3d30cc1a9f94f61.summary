by @entity0 published : 06:07 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 10:52 est , 24 january 2014 a historic chapel is set to be restored following centuries of neglect , after it was sold by the @entity5 for just £ 1			1
@entity6 stands in an abandoned hamlet on the banks of the @entity9 , and came close to falling apart as the area became wild and overgrown			1
but the @entity11 , which manages £ 8billion worth of land belonging to the royal family , has sold it for a nominal sum on condition that it is returned to its former glory			1
historic : @entity6 in the abandoned hamlet of @entity21 , @entity19 has been sold by the @entity11 for just £ 1 setting : the church can be seen at the centre of this photograph of the bucolic landscape which surrounds it on the banks of the @entity9 the church , in the now disappeared village of @entity29 in @entity19 , has been bought by the @entity30			1
they will spend £ 50,000 to ' stabilise ' the 12th - century church , whose origins lie in the @entity35 period , and preserve it for future generations			1
trust chairman @entity38 said : ' it is a hugely important building and its isolation is one of its joys			1
' there was once a little community there			0
traces of former buildings can be identified and there are headstones in the churchyard			0
' but now it just looks idyllic , like a little snapshot of days gone by			0
' empty : the roof has been stripped off the church and all of the fittings removed since it fell out of use in the 19th century in trouble : for decades the church , pictured her in 1985 , has been propped up by wooden beams against its walls renovation : @entity65 from the @entity30 , which has bought the building for £ 1 and pledged to restore it the church , believed to be one of the oldest buildings in @entity19 , is being examined by officials from @entity72			1
restoration experts will be brought in to plan how the church can be saved for future generations			0
the @entity76 has already secured funding from an environmental trust to enable builders to carry out a programme of stabilisation			2
mr @entity38 said : ' it is an important and valuable asset - its roots are certainly pre-norman and perhaps even earlier			0
' we hope further investigation will reveal significantly more of its ancient past			0
' aisle : the church fell out of use after the hamlet of @entity91 lost its final remaining inhabitants and was abandoned decline : @entity6 pictured in 1865 , shortly before it stopped hosting services work : an earlier attempt at preventing the building from falling apart is pictured in 1986 historical sources suggest that there was a church at @entity29 as early as the year 625 , although the present building was constructed in the 12th century , not long after the coming of the @entity100 to @entity101			1
it is thought to have had some connection to nearby @entity104 , a @entity106 foundation which was abandoned after the reformation and made famous by a @entity109 poem			2
one theory suggests that it may once have been a leper colony , which would explain the presence nearby of medicinal herbs such as green hellebore			0
vow : the trust bought the building from the @entity11 on the condition that it preserve the church for future generations eerie : the abandoned church occupies an evocative and romantic setting @entity6 is far from the first property to go on the market for just £ 1 - but most of ultra-cheap homes do not have such a storied past			1
a number of local councils have started selling off rundown houses for £ 1 , in order to regenerate deprived areas by ensuring that enthusiastic new homeowners move in and renovate their properties			1
last year , 35 derelict homes in @entity135 were sold off for a nominal sum to buyers who pledged to do up the houses			2
a similar scheme in @entity140 allowed a taxi driver to move his family into a spacious new home after handing over £ 1 and promising to spend around £ 35,000 on refurbishing the place			1
a boarded - up house in a @entity147 mining village was even cheaper , going on the market with a reserve price of nil - meaning the new owner could move in for free if he was willing to put a lot of work into it			0
the village of @entity29 had 10 houses in 1306 , but in 1750 there were only two inhabited properties			2
by the 19th century the church congregation was so small that services were only held in the summer months			2
it was finally abandoned in 1865			2
the roof and the interior fittings , together with the font , were removed , while the elements chipped away at the building making it appear increasingly desolate			0
the lead font can be dated to between 1120 and 1140 and is now in the @entity167 at @entity168			0
work on restoring the building is expected to start this summer			0
the hamlet now forms part of a nature reserve , with both the river and the nearby woodland providing an important habitat for wildlife			0
among the animals found the @entity9 near @entity29 are porpoises , otters and herons , while the forest is home to a number of rare plants , with the absence of people allowing the area to become a natural haven .			1

@entity6 , on the banks of the @entity9 , was built in the 12th century but has @entity193 origins
it has been *disused* for 150 years after the hamlet of @entity29 was abandoned by its inhabitants
the @entity11 has sold the chapel for £ 1 to a historic trust on the condition that they restore the building
