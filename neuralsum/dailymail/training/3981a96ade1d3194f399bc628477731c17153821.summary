@entity45 boat racing is a motorsport in which crews of two race 13 foot aluminum hulled boats around a small 20 - 30 turn , water filled 12 - 18ft wide track at speeds up to 80mph			1
the boats , powered with @entity57 - style @entity56 engines , can generate from @entity58 to more than @entity59 as they race against the clock around the tortuous courses			1
laps generally take just 45 to 60 seconds			0
the video , filmed by a spectator , shows a boat as it tears around the @entity7 track , kicking up spray			1
however , as it enters a straight pointing directly at the watching crowds , the driver appears to make a miscalculation , hitting a bank at the side of the course and skimming across it			0
when it re-enters the water of the course it is too late for boat 's driver to steer into the next turn and the boat jumps straight onto the bank and skids across grass , slamming into the spectators enclosure			2
the cameraman and a group of other spectators make their way towards where the boat has finally ground to a halt , but he is unable to get the cockpit into the frame , so it is not clear whether the boat 's drivers were injured			2
@entity45 boat racing , or jetsprinting as it 's sometimes known , originated as an organised sport in @entity101 in 1981 , and events were originally held in natural braided rivers			2
a crew consists of the driver and a navigator whoe guides the driver through the course - typically via simple hand signals - pointing the hand in the direction that the boat must go at the next intersection .			0
