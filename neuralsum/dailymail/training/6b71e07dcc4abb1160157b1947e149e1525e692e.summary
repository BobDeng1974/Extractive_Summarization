by @entity0 published : 06:14 est , 14 december 2013 updated : 11:42 est , 14 december 2013 @entity2 is set to be battered by a new freak weather system that could bring 100mph winds and blizzards in the run up to @entity7 , forecasters say			2
a so - called @entity8 could wreak havoc across much of the @entity2 beginning from the middle of next week , potentially toppling trees and tearing off roof tiles			2
@entity14 forecasters are naming the storm after @entity17 author @entity16 , who died 165 years ago next thursday - the day the storm is expected to strike			1
and looking forward to next week there is the chance that potentially strong winds could spread south and east , battering areas still recovering from the worst tidal floods for six decades			1
the unsettled weather is being caused by several low pressure systems sweeping across the @entity48 , between the @entity49 and @entity50			0
poor visibility : this week parts of @entity2 were enveloped by a thick blanket of fog			2
until thursday though most of the @entity55 can expect mild south - westerly winds and temperatures of up to @entity58 @entity35 forecaster @entity59 said this morning : ' through today there 's currently a low pressure system out to the north east that 's why we have that strong wind warning out today			1
' winds potentially up to 80 mph which could bring some disruption to travel and outdoor activities			0
the winds do ease overnight but from tomorrow there 's another low pressure area up to the north west			1
' the location of the low weather system to the north of the @entity2 means that winds will blow in from the south - east , keeping temperatures fairly mild for now at least			1
' through today there 's potential for seeing up to @entity79 to @entity80 in the @entity55 , ' said ms @entity59			0
' the coldest temperatures will be up in @entity34 tonight , where temperatures could drop to freezing			0
' a jogger runs along @entity85 beach near @entity86 at dawn today : the location of the low weather system to the north of the @entity2 means that winds will blow in from the south - east , keeping temperatures mild glorious : the sunrise casts a warm orange light behind wind turbines off the coast at @entity85 beach conditions are likely to remain unsettled throughout the week , but the most disruptive strong winds are likely to remain in the north and the west			1
but by thursday there is the potential for strong winds to spread south and east , perhaps picking up to gale force around coastal areas			1
it could bring fresh misery for people there after last week two people died and thousands were evacuated from their homes after that region was swamped by a record - breaking tidal surge			0
@entity14 meteorologist @entity114 told the @entity115 : ' from thursday to @entity7 there is a high risk of gales			0
' at the moment there is a 30 to 40 per cent risk of severe gales for central and southern @entity2 on thursday			0
' worst case is 70 to 90mph gusts across exposed parts of @entity126 and the south , but even 70mph gusts for central @entity2 would cause a lot of disruption			2
' @entity131 , forecaster for @entity132 , told the @entity133 : ' this weekend we are looking at winds of 70mph , but next week a much wider , deeper system could trigger gusts over 100mph			0

from thursday heavy winds will start to spread across south and east
@entity35 also issues @entity143 for north - western parts tonight
