he was the flawed genius who was famous for his exuberant approach to fashion , his love of the theatrical and his clever grasp of cut			0
now some of @entity10 's most striking designs are to go on display at the @entity12 in @entity13 , among them 30 previously unseen pieces			1
@entity15 originally went on display at @entity18 's @entity17 in the wake of @entity10 's death in 2010 but will relocate to @entity13 in the @entity21			1
finale : @entity10 's s / @entity24 collection explored what people would look like had they evolved from sea creatures new sections will include one that focuses on the early years of his career in @entity13 , as well as garments lent by stylist - and @entity10 's close friend - @entity33 , the @entity34 and the @entity35 of @entity36			1
the @entity37 will be expanded , with pieces created by @entity10 in collaboration with milliner @entity40 and jeweller @entity41 included in the display			1
@entity10 , who was found dead on the 11th february 2010 , was one of the @entity45 's most influential designers and the owner of a little black book that encompassed everyone from royals to first ladies and fashion editors			1
the son of a taxi driver and a social science teacher , the glittering world he came to inhabit was a far cry from the humble terraced home in @entity58 , south @entity13 , where he grew up with his five brothers and sisters			2
striking : a @entity63 pearl necklace from @entity64 and a duck feather dress from the @entity67 collection clever : as this @entity70 collection reveals , @entity10 never lost his passion for the theatrical after leaving school at 16 with a single @entity75 in art , the fledgling designer went on to do an apprenticeship at @entity78 tailors @entity79 , before a stint at theatrical costumiers , @entity82 and @entity83			1
both would have huge influence on his later career			0
@entity10 's big break came following a spell in @entity89 working for @entity90			1
on his return to @entity13 , he applied to @entity92 for work as a pattern cutter			2
impressed by his portfolio , @entity96 , the head of the master 's course , persuaded him to enrol as a student instead			0
his faith in @entity10 paid off			2
the designer 's graduate collection earned him rave reviews and the entire thing was bought by @entity105			2
from there , @entity10 went on to become one of the most influential designers of his generation , designing @entity111 's tour wardrobe in 1996 and following up with his infamous ' bumsters ' - which then sparked a craze for low slung jeans			2
the same year , he was appointed creative director at @entity36 , replacing fellow @entity117 @entity116 , and relocated to @entity118			0
beautiful : a fantastical dress from @entity10 's @entity122 collection and an equally spectacular @entity64 gown genius : @entity10 , who died in february 2010 , was one of @entity45 's most influential designers but despite his success , @entity10 never forgot his @entity13 roots , often speaking of his love for the @entity45 capital			1
indeed , he once spoke of how inspiring he found the @entity12 itself , saying : ' the collections at the @entity12 never fail to intrigue and inspire me			0
' the nation is privileged to have access to such a resource ... it 's the sort of place i 'd like to be shut in overnight			0
' the museum repaid the compliment , first by including the designer 's work in @entity142 : 50 years of @entity143 in 1997 , and then again in its fashion in motion series			1
but it is @entity15 that will be the largest retrospective of @entity10 's work hosted by the museum , with more than 200 different pieces set to go on show			1
wonderful : @entity40 and @entity41 were regular collaborators and made these spectacular hats legacy : although the designer is gone , his label lives on in the capable hands of designer @entity158 among the pieces included are gowns from his 1992 postgraduate collection , as well as some of his a / @entity164 designs - the last he would ever create			0
his final collection was never completed , with just 16 dresses shown to fashion editors in @entity118 a month after he died			0
but while @entity10 might be gone , his brand lives on and , in the capable hands of his former assistant @entity158 , continues to go from strength to strength			0
' @entity174 was a genius and a true visionary who pushed boundaries , challenged and inspired , ' she explains			0
' he believed in creativity and innovation and his talent was limitless			0
@entity15 is a celebration of the most imaginative and talented designer of our time			2

@entity15 , a retrospective of @entity10 's work , will move to @entity13
the show , at the @entity12 from march , will include 30 previously unseen pieces
originally staged by the @entity17 , it has been expanded
celebrates the work of designer @entity10 who died in 2010
