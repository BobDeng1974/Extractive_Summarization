an @entity1 law student is demanding £ 100,000 compensation payment after claiming that his feelings had been hurt by a racist pink children 's crayon sold by one of @entity1 's largest stationery manufacturers ' this can only be explained by the fact that the ' special skin crayon ' which is part of the product line is either defective or labelled misleadingly or both			1
' it is both insensitive and inconsiderate to label one particular shade as ' skin colour ' in a market where a majority of the consumers have skin tones that are either dark or at least different from the shade described as ' skin ' by the company			0

he said he had contacted the maker of the ' @entity43 ' crayons - @entity41 - and had demanded an explanation but said he had not been given one instead he was told that they had always called it that , and had no plans to change it			0
he said : ' i believe that such a crayon will reinforce stereotypes about racial supremacy			0
it is written on the box of crayons that they are meant for four - year - old children			2
what impact will it have on these young minds when they realise that their skin colour is not recognised ? wo n't it reinforce the notions of beauty that fairness products or films seek to impose when they realise that their skin colour is not one that is regarded as the norm ? ' the case has been filed in the consumer court in @entity1 's southern @entity75 city where the trainee lawyer has demanded compensation of £ 1000 gbp from the manufacturer for hurting his feelings and a further £ 100,000 from the @entity80 the racist crayon caused .			2
