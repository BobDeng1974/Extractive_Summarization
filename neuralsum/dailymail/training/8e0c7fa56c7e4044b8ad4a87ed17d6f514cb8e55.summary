security contractors warned @entity2 's @entity1 nearly three months before a deadly 2012 terror attack on its diplomatic outpost in @entity5 , @entity6 that guards were quitting at an alarming rate , leaving the facility vulnerable to assault			1
@entity11 , a center - right watchdog group , said tuesday that it obtained damning emails as part of a @entity15 lawsuit against the @entity1			1
they paint a picture of frantic warnings about armed security personnel not showing up to work and refusing to work night shifts because they were afraid of the @entity23 militia that ultimately killed @entity25 's ambassador to @entity6 and three other @entity25 as they laid waste to the compound			1
the documents refer repeatedly to ' emergency shift ' workers and show 8 - hour windows in overnight security rotations when few if any guards were on patrol			2
the company told @entity1 contract specialist @entity54 security guards were fleeing and leaving the @entity55 vulnerable			1
' due to the amount of local guard force members leaving out of fear of their safety , ' the company reported , ' and the long process to security check individuals , it makes it very difficult to quickly react to a large drop in staff in quick succession as has been occurring with all the incidents			0
' chief among those ' incidents ' was the june 5 bombing of the compound 's outer perimeter wall			1
@entity74 chairman rep. @entity73 , a @entity76 @entity75 , later wrote to then - @entity2 that the attack left a hole described by locals as ' big enough for forty men to go through			2
' @entity82 's reports to the @entity1 included a note that six days later a guard ' did not attend ' his night shift ' and gave no prior warning of absence			2
' ' it is believed that the explosive device set off on the compound perimeter wall had a lasting effect on certain members of the staff , ' the report said ; ' this promoted a fear factor when it came to working the nightshift			1
' three days later the company warned the @entity1 about ' last minute resignations of ... guard staff ' that left the mission 's security even weaker			2
the newly uncovered documents ' show that the @entity25 @entity106 at @entity5 was a sitting duck and that the @entity1 â€™s local militia " security " feared for their own safety and would n't even show up to provide necessary protection , ' @entity11 president @entity103 said in a statement wednesday			1
' all security indicators were flashing red and , perhaps , with a show of strength to secure the @entity5 mission , @entity25 ambassador @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 might be alive today			1
' problems with protecting the compound were apparent in reports filed about incidents going back as far as april 2012			0
aftermath : the compound was destroyed and abandoned quickly as @entity25 personnel scrambled to evacuate one of @entity82 's guard commanders was fired on april 18 after he got into a fight with a soldier tasked to a @entity131 in @entity5			0
another guard ' failed to turn up for duty ' without warning on april 22			0
that left the entire compound in the hands of four men during the perilous hours between midnight and 8:00 a.m. assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs @entity139 , then the @entity1 's chief spokesperson , claimed three days after the sept. 11 , 2012 attack that no outside contractors had been hired to provide security for the @entity5 mission			1
she was forced to retract that statement a week later , conceding the @entity146 was contracted to keep the facility and its personnel safe			0
@entity11 said wednesday that the @entity150 administration has not turned over any documents showing the state of security in @entity5 during the last critical weeks before the attack			0
the group announced three new federal lawsuits demanding those records , and others that relate to the @entity1 's role in crafting a false narrative about the attack 's causes			0
numerous @entity150 administration officials , including the president himself , pinned early blame on a clumsily produced online video that lampooned the @entity167 prophet @entity166			0
while simultaneous protests in @entity170 and elsewhere were in part inspired by outrage over the video , no evidence has emerged to suggest that the militants who attacked in @entity5 were acting as part of a spontaneous mob			0
instead , investigations have consistently shown that the armed assault was a carefully planned and expertly executed military mission , complete with precision mortars that plunged the compound into chaos			0
mrs. @entity2 , now the @entity184 ' front - runner in the 2016 presidential contest , still faces stern questions from members of @entity188 and the press about her role in the security failures and the attack 's pr - nightmare aftermath .			2
