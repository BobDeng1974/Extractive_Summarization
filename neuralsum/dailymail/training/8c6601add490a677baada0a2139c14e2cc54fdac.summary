by @entity0 published : 09:08 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 09:08 est , 8 july 2013 people who achieve better grades at university are more likely to experience feelings of romantic jealousy on @entity6 , according to a new study			1
the study asked undergraduates to imagine scenarios like discovering a message in their partner â€™s @entity6 inbox from a person of the opposite sex saying : ' what are you up to later ? ' they found that those with a higher level of intelligence or grade point average ( @entity21 ) were the most jealous			2
the latest research has found that people who get better grades at university are more likely to get jealous of ambiguous @entity6 messages sent to their partners while the findings are preliminary , researcher @entity27 , an associate professor of psychology at @entity29 in @entity30 , @entity31 , who carried out the study , said : ' it may be that people with high gpas tend to have a personality type that makes them more prone to jealousy			1
' students with higher gpas are often more conscientious , show greater self - control and tend to be perfectionists			0
' the perceived infidelity likely upsets their attempts at perfection across the board			0
' the study also looked at whether adding different emoticons ( like smiley or winking faces ) after the message would affect jealousy levels			0
while it has been found that women are more ' @entity6 jealous ' than men , men feel jealous when emoticons are used at the end of messages to their partners while it has previously been proven that women have higher levels of @entity6 jealousy than men , men were actually more jealous when the message had an emoticon			1
' evolutionary work suggests men are more jealous of sexual infidelity , while women are more jealous of emotional infidelity , ' the winking emoticon was most likely perceived as flirtatious , perhaps even sexually suggestive , which may explain why men were more jealous in this condition , ' @entity69 added .			0

perceived infidelity likely upsets their attempts at perfection , study found
