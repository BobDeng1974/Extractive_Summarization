political leaders and commentators around the world are reacting to news that @entity4 has voted no to leaving @entity5 - as attention turns to other separatist movements fighting for independence			1
while much of the international coverage of the referendum result has been positive , with everyone from @entity14 media to @entity16 ministers cheering the no vote , other countries were less supportive			1
among those criticizing the way the independence referendum was handled are a number of @entity23 figures who have desperately sought to draw parallels with the much - criticized @entity27 referendum in march , which came after @entity28 forcibly annexed the peninsula from @entity30			1
with @entity4 rejecting the opportunity to form an independent nation , attention has now turned to other separatist movements around the world - with nervous @entity36 among those concerned that the referendum will lead to calls for similar votes in regions fighting for self - government in their country			1
speaking to the media today , he described the much - criticized referendum held in @entity27 in march as having been ' fairer ' than the one held in @entity4 and hinted he thought underhand tactics may have been deployed by ' no ' campaigners			1
' in terms of legitimacy and the conditions in which they were carried out , the @entity27 referendum was conducted in a much fairer way than the @entity4 one , ' he said			1
' at least there were no power cuts , there was no fire alarm or halts in the counting of votes and so on , ' he added - apparently referring to a brief power outage in @entity81 , ironically one of only four @entity4 regions where more people voted ' yes ' to independence than ' no '			2
many @entity23 commentators had been passionately campaigning for a ' yes ' vote - ostensibly in the hope that it may have sparked a wave of referendums in former - @entity90 republics that could lead to the countries demanding closer ties with @entity93			2
disappointed : @entity94 , a former politician who supports @entity28 president @entity95 , tweeted the words ' oh , @entity4 , @entity4			1
well , not to worry			0
in 300 years or so you can try again ' difference : following the ' no ' result , @entity99 ( right ) dramatically quit as @entity4 's first minister			2
@entity102 welcomed the outcome - but said now is the time to listen to the voices of @entity106 many of these people expressed disappointment when the vote came in - among them @entity94 , a former politician who passionately supports @entity28 president @entity95			1
having proudly displayed a ' yes ' ribbon to his @entity113 profile in recent weeks , mr @entity94 had removed it by the time he tweeted an image of @entity115 in his @entity117 outfit along with the words ' oh , @entity4 , @entity4			0
well , not to worry			0
in 300 years or so you can try again			0
' all over : a pro-union supporter in @entity121 bursts into tears of relief as fellow no campaigners cheer welcoming the results as @entity4 rejects separation another country less than positive about the referendum result was @entity129 , where leading daily newspaper @entity130 said @entity132 spirit had been ' wounded ' despite the outcome			1
the newspaper also suggested that @entity135 may appreciate the value @entity5 more than @entity132 themselves , saying : ' if @entity4 no longer had a need for @entity5 , at least according to many voters , @entity135 needs @entity5			1
' @entity140 's education minister @entity139 struck a similar tone when she described the result made her happy , adding : ' we never like to see @entity135 nations break up ... the opposite result would have been a negative signal			2
' that sentiment was echoed by governing @entity149 's secretary for @entity135 @entity150 and centrist mp of the @entity153 party @entity154 - both of whom called the no vote a ' relief '			1
the @entity4 ' yes ' campaign had picked up strong support among @entity140 citizens however , who remain sentimental about a medieval anti-english alliance between the two countries			2
@entity135 support : @entity140 's education minister @entity139 ( left ) said the referendum result made her happy , adding : ' we never like to see @entity135 nations break up			1
' @entity169 's foreign minister @entity168 ( right ) said ' the @entity132 stays united			0
so must @entity135 ' decisions : @entity168 appeared to use the result to send a signal to @entity5 to think twice before holding a proposed future referendum of whether or not to leave the @entity174 earlier this week it was reported that there had been ' worry ' and ' mystification ' over the referendum in @entity179			1
@entity181 animation studio tomonews responded by creating a bizarre ' explainer ' video @entity16 media reacted to the @entity4 result positively , with popular tabloid @entity186 headlining its report ' @entity5 stays @entity5 '			1
' the @entity132 can rejoice , the @entity132 remains intact			0
their partners in @entity190 and @entity191 can breathe , @entity5 can continue to fulfill its international responsibilities , ' weekly news magazine @entity188 added			2
@entity169 's foreign minister @entity168 , meanwhile , appeared to use the result to send a signal to @entity5 to think twice before holding a proposed future referendum of whether or not to leave the @entity174			1
' the @entity132 stays united			0
so must @entity135 , ' he said without elaborating on his comment			0
another thinly veiled @entity200 comments came from @entity201 , the president of the @entity202 , who said : the @entity202 welcomes the fact that during the debate over the past years , the @entity4 government and the @entity4 people have repeatedly reaffirmed their @entity135 commitment			2
' the @entity181 animation shows @entity102 , carrying deputy prime minister @entity209 on his front , standing alongside better together leader @entity211 to encourage voters to back the no campaign better together ? @entity115 as @entity217 ( right ) , @entity214 ( centre ) and @entity216 ( left ) all appear in the bizarre @entity181 animation standing in front of a unicorn meanwhile @entity222 secretary general @entity221 said : ' i fully respect the choice that the people of @entity4 have made in yesterday 's referendum			2
i welcome prime minister @entity102 's statement that the @entity132 will go forward as a united country			0
' ' the @entity132 is a founding member of @entity222 , and i am confident that the @entity132 will continue to play a leading role to keep our @entity232 strong , ' he added			0
the independence referendum result also became a hot topic in @entity14 , where one social media user said : ' the @entity132 shows the world its political civilization and shows other regimes , which only show their muscle and use force , how there are alternatives to handling disputes , ' according to the @entity245			0
the official @entity14 state line was more muted however			0
while some politicians welcome the idea of a limited @entity5 , they remain key not to send out too many positive signals about independence movements as a whole so as not to further encourage those who have been fighting for the independence of the region of @entity256 since the 1950s			2
earlier this week it was reported that there had been ' worry ' and ' mystification ' in @entity179 , promoting @entity181 animation studio @entity261 to produce a bizarre ' explainer ' video packed with stereotypes about @entity4 - and even a cameo from @entity268 's charactor @entity216			0
another nation unsurprisingly keen to speak up for the concept of unity is @entity36 , which has long battled against independence movements in a number of regions including @entity274 ( pictured ) mps in the state of @entity274 are today voting on whether to hold their own independence referendum in a move fiercely opposed by the country 's central government in @entity281			1
pictured are pro-independence supporters another nation unsurprisingly keen to speak up for the concept of unity is @entity36 , which has long battled against independence movements in a number of regions			0
in fact @entity275 in the state of @entity274 are today voting on whether to hold their own independence referendum in a move fiercely opposed by the country 's central government in @entity281			1
in a video statement that avoided any mention of @entity274 , @entity36 prime minister @entity291 today expressed his content with the outcome in @entity4 and attacked the @entity4 independence movement			1
' with their decision , @entity4 have avoided the large economic , social , institutional and political consequences that separation would have brought , ' he said			0
' yesterday they chose between segregation and integration			0
between isolation and being open			0
and they chose the best option for everyone â€“ for themselves and for @entity135			0

mixed international response to @entity4 voting against leaving @entity5
most countries in @entity135 *championed* the result as ' positive ' and a ' relief '
but @entity28 mp @entity56 said the vote *compared* *unfavourably* with a much - criticized referendum held in annexed @entity27 in march
@entity36 - which has many separatist *groups* - unsurprisingly cheered result
mps in @entity274 are today voting on whether to hold their own referendum
