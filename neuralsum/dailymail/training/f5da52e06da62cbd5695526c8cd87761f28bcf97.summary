by @entity0 last updated at 5:23 pm on 27th december 2011 travel chaos today affected millions of motorists as @entity4 's roads were filled with those returning from @entity7 breaks			0
although many workers will not return to their jobs until after the new year , huge numbers of @entity4 headed back to the office just two days after @entity7 , as sales and disrupted rail services also led to severe congestion			1
traffic experts reported massive tailbacks and problems on parts of the @entity19 in the @entity20 and @entity21 , as well as the @entity22 in @entity23 and the @entity24 , the @entity25 in the @entity26 and the @entity27 around @entity28			1
jammed : a traffic camera over the @entity31 southbound shows huge tailbacks due to a combination of the sales , lack of trains and people returning from @entity7 breaks tailback : on the @entity40 in the @entity21 , there were similar scenes as the worst incidents saw traffic stretch back for miles at lunchtime today , traffic images showed congestion stretching back for over 30 miles on one stretch of the @entity27 clockwise near @entity49			1
on another section of the @entity27 traffic journeys were slowed by over an hour as slow traffic snailed back for 28 miles , with motorists battling to get in and out of the capital			1
meanwhile on the @entity19 , the regularly - congested section of motorway north of @entity57 was again clogged up with motorists , many of whom were returning from @entity7 breaks			2
further tailbacks of around 10 miles were reported on the @entity25 in @entity63 , along with delayed journeys further north on the @entity40 and @entity65			2
on the @entity27 at junction 5 southbound , drivers faced a battle to get into and out of the capital a spokesperson for the @entity71 said today : ' we are seeing traffic levels on motorways and major a-roads increase after the @entity7 break			1
' we currently have some incidents and congestion on some of our routes , including the @entity25 , the @entity27 , the @entity19 and the @entity22			1
as always , we are doing all we can to clear these as quickly as possible			0
' the increased congestion may also be due to the hugely reduced rail services currently running around the country			2
crawling : a map of the @entity27 , where red and yellow lines indicate incidents or severe delays , shows the congestion motorists had to contend with today delays : a map of other parts of @entity91 shows there were significant delays on the @entity94 in the @entity26 and the @entity19 in the @entity95 and @entity21 before @entity7 , train services started to run down in advance of a complete shut - down of the rail network on the day itself , with services axed in most areas on @entity102 , and a late start to a limited @entity105 service on tuesday			1
@entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 are among those writing off the majority of @entity7 with blank departure and arrivals boards			0
the worst tailbacks on @entity4 's roads were on the nation 's motorways , as motorists struggled in light of rail chaos			1
the @entity27 suffered from slow traffic and congestion for 30 miles clockwise between junctions 7 and 15 , while other sections of the motorway also endured tailbacks over 10 miles long			1
the @entity19 suffered problems around @entity131 between junctions 9 and 11 in both directions , while further up the same motorway in the north west there were also severe delays			2
in the north west , the @entity40 and @entity65 were subject to heavy congestion , while back down in the south and east the @entity25 and @entity94 motorways were packed with motorists			1
and many of those trains which do eventually run between @entity7 and @entity145 will be subject to delays , diversions and cancellations caused by engineering works and the dreaded bus replacement services			0
@entity151 traveled from @entity152 in @entity153 to @entity28 's @entity154 on the first train of the day on tuesday			0
fuming @entity151 , 30 , said : ' i had to fight to get my reserved seat this morning , as the train was absolutely heaving			0
' i sat for almost two hours with a suitcase on my lap while elderly women and children were forced to stand in the aisles - it was chaos			2
' the buffet section closed early because the train was too busy and we had some heavy delays getting across the country			0
' people were getting on and off at every station but once i actually got into @entity28 the traffic was n't that bad - it was just getting towards the city that proved difficult			0
' in @entity176 , railway signal workers started a 72 - hour strike yesterday in a dispute over career progression			0
and to add to @entity4 ' woes , tube services were hit by striking @entity183 workers who wanted extra pay to work on @entity102			0
an @entity186 spokespersons said the return to work after @entity7 was traditionally a time when they have to deal with a lot of breakdowns			0
the spokesperson said the huge amount of traffic on the roads was also a result of the @entity102 sales which started yesterday .			2

thirty - mile tailbacks on @entity27 , huge *queues* on other motorways
traffic experts say rail chaos and sales to blame for congestion
drivers on @entity22 in @entity23 and @entity24 , @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity94 and @entity25 also endure tailbacks
