@entity0 have replaced @entity1 with @entity2 in a late bid to stave off relegation from the @entity5			1
the humiliating 4 - 0 home defeat by @entity7 not only came at the expense of the @entity10 's job , but also leaves the @entity0 a single point above the drop zone			1
here , @entity13 looks at how some other clubs have fared after bringing in a new boss at late notice ... @entity17 @entity2 has nine games to stave off relegation at the @entity20 @entity22 scores as @entity7 humiliate @entity0 4 - 0 in the @entity5 on saturday @entity1 waves as he leaves the field after what would be his last game as @entity0 boss @entity29 - @entity28 and @entity30 ( 6 april 2014 ) @entity28 guided @entity29 to 11th in his first season but struggled the following season and was sacked with the @entity29 five points clear of the drop in 17th , but with @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 as four of their last five games			1
it was always going to be an uphill struggle for youth coach @entity30 and , despite picking up a point against the @entity45 , were relegated			0
@entity46 ran out for @entity28 at @entity29 , but @entity30 ( right ) could n't save @entity29 from the drop @entity48 - @entity47 and @entity49 ( 11 march 2013 ) it looked like a shrewd move when @entity48 replaced promotion - winning boss @entity47 with @entity49 , who had been somewhat harshly binned by @entity52 in january			1
but it was too late for the former physio to heal the @entity48 ' season , winning just one of his eight @entity5 games as @entity48 made an immediate return to the @entity60			0
@entity47 left @entity48 under a cloud but @entity49 won just one game as @entity48 were relegated see how the other seven managers from @entity64 have fared in @entity5 hotseats @entity67 - @entity66 and @entity68 ( 15 march 2010 ) after the half - time team talk on the pitch and singing to celebrate survival in 2009 , @entity66 's luck finally ran out having won just one of his last 15 games as @entity67 boss			0
he was placed on gardening leave and replaced by former @entity78 and @entity79 manager @entity68 , but the rot had already set in and @entity67 collected just six more points on their way to relegation			0
@entity66 lost the eye of the @entity85 while @entity68 could n't claw his way to safety with @entity67 @entity88 - @entity28 and @entity89 ( 1 april 2009 ) when @entity90 was required heart surgery in february 2009 , @entity28 was temporarily placed in charge but only won one of his six games , leaving @entity88 in 18th			1
club legend @entity89 was surprisingly parachuted in to turn things around but his only victory came in a 3 - 1 win against @entity98 and the @entity99 suffered a shock relegation			2
it can work ... but beware short - term fixes : bringing in a legend is no guarantee as @entity88 found after replacing @entity28 with @entity89 @entity0 - @entity105 and @entity106 ( 30 march 2013 ) @entity105 was dismissed with @entity0 16th , a point above the drop zone but having played a game more than fellow strugglers @entity110 and @entity7			1
controversial @entity111 @entity106 quite literally made his mark — ruining his suit with a knee - slide to celebrate 3 - 0 victory over rivals @entity88 — and secured a comfortable 14th place			2
but that was about as good as it got for @entity106 at the @entity20 as he was sacked just five games into the following campaign with his side rock bottom on one point			2
@entity105 could n't find the answers while @entity106 's success at @entity0 was short lived @entity128 - @entity127 and @entity129 ( 10 april 2007 ) they may have gone seven games without a win but it was a shock when @entity127 was sacked with five games to go — especially as @entity128 were five points clear of danger			2
former @entity136 boss @entity129 made a stuttering start but eventually ensured survival on the penultimate day with a 1 - 0 win over @entity35			0
his reign did n't last long , though , as @entity141 came to the rescue in december 2007 with @entity128 still battling against the drop			0
@entity129 ( right ) saved @entity128 on the final day after @entity127 was handed his @entity144			0

@entity0 have replaced sacked manager @entity1 with @entity2
the @entity0 are a point above drop zone after 4 - 0 humiliation by @entity7
managers *including* @entity28 , @entity89 and @entity106 have also answered late sos calls , with *differing* results
