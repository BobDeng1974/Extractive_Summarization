making my way towards the stairs in a town centre camera shop , i almost came to a crashing halt after catching sight of something on display i had n't expected to see			0
no , not a state - of - the - art tripod or elegant pewter frame , but a generous glimpse of a globular breast , crammed into the mouth of a suckling infant			2
breast and baby belonged to a woman in her early 30s who 'd selected the bottom step as a place to feed her baby			1
mothers up in arms : dozens joined in a breast - feeding protest in support of @entity24 feeling queasy at the unanticipated sight , as well as more than a little disturbed by the woman 's apparent indifference to the feelings of everyone else and her unapologetic willingness to feed in the centre of a busy store , i tried to look anywhere other than in front of me			1
this was especially difficult since i had to navigate my way around mother and child before sprinting to the first floor			0
what is it about some breast - feeding mums ? why do they think they have the inalienable right to nurse their babies anywhere they like , without giving any thought to the location or the sensitivities of those around them ? i say this not as some dried - up prude who 's never experienced a cracked nipple			1
no , i say this as a mother who breast - fed four children , but always resisted the urge to do so in anything other than a discreet way			1
aside from not wishing strangers ( or even friends ) to be party to what i believe is the most lovely and intimate of acts , i imagine few would have relished the sight of my hungry infant slurping down its elevenses			0
@entity24 has been involved in a public breast feeding event @entity24 was labelled a ' tramp ' by a photographer who snapped her breast - feeding her baby @entity72 in her local town centre unfortunately , thanks to the increasingly militant voice of the ' breastapo ' , criticising a woman who breast - feeds in public is tantamount to treason			1
after i suggested on a @entity83 radio programme this week that mothers should be circumspect about where they nurse their babies , the response was little short of nuclear , with opprobrium piled on me by the vocal pro-breast - feeding lobby			2
but i was struck by how many messages i received online and in conversation from woman who felt the same way as me			2
they told me i had articulated the views they felt too afraid to express themselves			0
that 's right , too afraid			0
as one said , after finding herself next to a woman at a bus stop feeding her child : ' i felt violated since she had no thoughts for my feelings , but you just ca n't say that nowadays , can you ? ' there has been a rash of stories about women who say they 've been victimised for breast - feeding in public			1
one was ticked off for doing so at a naval museum , another in a hospital waiting room			0
following her appearance on @entity119 , @entity117 was inundated with messages from women who are offended by public breast - feeding last week , 27 - year - old @entity24 was photographed feeding her eight - month - old daughter on the steps of a @entity125 pub while eating a sandwich			1
she was unaware of the photographer who later posted the picture on @entity129 with the charming inscription : ' i know the sun is out ' n ' all that , but there 's no need to let your kid feast on your nipple in town ! ! ! @entity139			0
' to label @entity24 a tramp was a vile insult			0
but when i saw the picture , there was a part of me , while not condoning the language or actions of the photographer , that could see why her behaviour may have triggered an adverse reaction			0
for rather than looking for somewhere low - key to feed her daughter , @entity24 chose to park herself in the middle of a busy town centre , shopping bags sprawled around her feet			2
i would n't do that with just a sandwich in my hand , never mind with a little one to attend to			0
surely where we choose to breast - feed requires more graciousness than that ? ' to all too many breast - feeding mothers , this word ' natural ' nourishes the belief that they have a licence to do it anywhere			1
regardless of who is watching			0
' of course , there 's nothing worse than feeling under pressure to feed a howling , hungry baby , especially since its anguished cry can make your breasts leak like a faulty washer			2
i 've been there myself - many times			2
but i never felt the needs of my baby awarded me the right to breast - feed wherever i chose			1
if i was out shopping , i 'd sprint back to the car , find a seat in the corner of a cafe or retreat to an out - of - the - way park bench			2
yet over and over again i 've had no choice but to been confronted by earth mothers on the train , in restaurants , in the middle of busy shopping centres or at picnic sites breast - feeding in full view , without any attempt to be discreet			1
it goes without saying that breast - feeding - for those who can and want to do it - is a wonderful thing			1
indeed , 81 per cent of women now start their babies on breast milk compared with just 66 per cent in the mid-nineties			2
it 's good for the baby 's health , as well as easier for mum than having to sterilise bottles and buy formula			0
oh yes , and it 's also natural			0
and that 's the killer point			0
to all too many breast - feeding mothers , this word ' natural ' nourishes the belief that they have a licence to do it anywhere			1
regardless of who is watching			0
@entity221 says she feels queasy when she witnesses mothers breast - feeding in public what they are forgetting is that breasts are , by their nature , sexual			1
why else do women crowbar their bosoms into clingy dresses and skimpy bikinis ? they want the world to see that they are attractive			2
but things change when you 're breast - feeding			1
during this time , breasts are not intended to flaunt your sexual availability to the world , but to meet the needs of one little person - your baby			2
that 's why so many women feel unsettled when we see a mother treating breast - feeding like a spectator sport			1
the combative attitude of the breast - feeding lobby is part of the problem			1
@entity24 took , to my mind , an inflammatory course of action when she retaliated to the nasty @entity129 posting by organising a breast - feeding demonstration around the @entity260 pub where she had been photographed			1
the site of a phalanx of women with boobs visible at 50 paces and babies latched on turned my stomach			0
such an aggressive exploitation of a tender maternal act was , to me , the ultimate betrayal of what breast - feeding is all about			1
it should be an intimate , bonding experience , not a show to prove a political point			0
certainly , breast - feeding was a private and special time for me and my babies			1
i especially enjoyed it with my daughter , @entity279 , now nine			0
she was the youngest by six years and , uninterrupted by demanding toddlers as i had been with my other children , i could relax , sit quietly and enjoy the experience , knowing it was what we both wanted			0
i used to love feeling utterly justified in plonking myself in front of some slushy afternoon movie and just letting her take her time			0
no one is suggesting women should n't be allowed to breast - feed their children			1
in fact , the @entity295 states it is unlawful for mums to be discriminated against or treated unfavourably because they are breast - feeding			1
but perhaps the politicians behind this statute should have insisted facilities were made available in shopping centres , supermarkets and department stores to enable mothers to feed in private			0
instead , the rest of us are made to feel like criminals for wanting to look away .			0

@entity117 says she is sick of seeing women publicly breast - feed
she has received many messages from other woman who are appalled by it
she says it is possible to breast - feed while remaining discreet
