@entity0 admits thursday can not come soon enough as he bids to complete the career grand slam by winning the masters			1
the hype surrounding @entity0 's attempt to join @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10 in winning all four major titles has been building since the night before his @entity13 victory at @entity14 last july			1
and although the return of @entity10 to competitive action after two months on the sidelines has taken some of the spotlight off @entity0 , the world no 1 is anxious to let his clubs do the talking			1
@entity0 insists he has arrived at @entity23 ready to mount a serious challenge on the masters the world no 1 shields himself from the rain as he plays a shot during a practice round ' i said in the middle of last week , ' if @entity23 was to start tomorrow , i 'd be okay			1
i 'm ready , '' @entity0 said on tuesday			1
' i think that 's a good indication of where i am with my game			2
i 've been ready for this thing to start for a week already so just trying to keep my game where it is and do some quality work , not overdo it			1
' just do the right amount so that when i got here yesterday for the first time , i was ready to play and just needed to go see the golf course			2
i was n't working on anything in my game , my swing			2
was n't thinking about technique at all			2
just all about hitting the shots i need to and thinking about how to manage my game and get it around here for the next four days			0
' results-wise , the last three tournaments have n't been what i 've wanted			0
i still feel like there 's plenty of positives to take from them , especially @entity53 and @entity54 , i felt like i played pretty good there			0
a couple silly mistakes here and there , but for the most part i felt like i got what i needed out of them			0
' but the last two weeks have been great			0
i 've just practised at home in @entity64 and made another trip up here a couple of fridays ago			0
' i just really felt like spending a couple of weeks away from this ( media attention ) , i guess , and just preparing at home and in private and not really having everything critiqued and analysed and over-analysed			0
i just wanted to get away from it all , and i feel like it 's been a good thing			0
' all eyes have been on @entity10 ' latest comeback , which could take the pressure off of @entity0 the @entity75 speaks to @entity77 's girlfriend @entity76 and his children during practice @entity0 followed @entity80 into the media centre at @entity82 and admitted the presence of the 14 - time major winner - who was relaxed and jovial with the press - could work in his favour			1
' a little bit , i guess , ' the 25 - year - old added			0
' it is such a big story , @entity10 coming back at the masters after a bit of a lengthy period where he has not been around			1
but still i 'm just here to play golf and you guys can write the stories , i wo n't read them and we 'll move on			0
' @entity0 has recorded just one top - 10 finish in six previous appearances at @entity23 - last year 's tie for eighth - although he did take a four - shot lead into the final round in 2011 before collapsing to a closing 80			1
he admits he will have to play the par fives better to have a chance of slipping on a green jacket on sunday , covering them in level par last year compared to eight under by champion @entity111 , who finished eight shots ahead			2
@entity0 led the field heading into the final day of the 2011 masters before suffering a dramatic meltdown @entity0 plays a shot from the azaleas as he recorded his best finish of eighth in last year 's tournament but he also believes @entity82 suits his game if he can take advantage of having a nine iron in his hands for second shots to holes like the 13th and 15th			1
' i think i 've developed a game where i can compete at pretty much any golf course now			0
that might not have been the case two or three years ago , ' @entity0 added			1
' but if you 're looking at the courses , @entity23 's the one that should set up the best for me just with my ball flight and being comfortable off the tee here , especially being able to turn the ball over from right to left			2
' if i can play the way i know i can around here and just have a good week on the greens , then there 's no reason why i should n't have a good chance			0
