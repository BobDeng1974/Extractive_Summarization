a postcard and a calendar from 1974 may finally prove a pensioner 's claim that there has been a mix - up over the true identity of the model in @entity10 's famous ' @entity9 ' poster			1
photographer @entity11 always credited model @entity12 , his then girlfriend , as starring in the dream - like photograph taken on a sunny day in 1976			1
but @entity16 has for 30 years claimed the bare bum in the picture , which became famous in the 1980s and decorated a generation of boys ' bedrooms , in fact belonged to his ex-wife			1
and now , he says , he has found proof			0
the @entity9 : @entity10 's famous poster of a young woman bearing her bottom on a sun - soaked tennis court became one of the most - famous images in the world during the late 1970s and the 1980s controversy : but @entity16 , a pensioner from @entity33 , @entity34 , claims the woman credited with being the model in the photograph , @entity12 , is wrong and that it in fact shows his ex-wife ' @entity12 [ @entity39 ] has always said she had a photo shoot with her knickers off with @entity11 , ' said mr @entity16			1
' she thinks that the photo shoot they had was the one that was used - that 's not the case			2
' exhibit a is a postcard mr @entity16 bought off @entity47 showing the @entity9 picture , but stamped with a 1974 postmark - two years before mr @entity11 claims he shot the photograph			1
exhibit b is a 1974 calendar unearthed by the pensioner			1
it is illustrated with a photograph so similar to the @entity9 shot it seems likely they could have been taken during the same shoot			0
the 72 - year - old also claims that mr @entity11 , who died of cancer in 2010 , had confessed to him in a meeting that ms @entity12 is not the real @entity9			2
' @entity12 was photographed by @entity11 , but that was years after the initial photo was taken , ' mr @entity16 said			1
' @entity11 photographed my ex-wife , and tried to flog it to the poster manufacturer @entity10			2
' @entity10 were n't interested to begin with , but eventually they came back to him and commissioned him to take the photo properly and lent him some professional gear			0
' exhibit a : mr @entity16 claims to have bought this postcard from @entity47			1
postmarked 1974 , it nevertheless shows the unmistakable @entity9 image , which by the photographer 's account was n't taken until 1976 exhibit b : this 1974 calendar shows what appears to be another photograph from the same set as the @entity9 shot , which mr @entity16 says is further evidence that the iconic photo was in fact a picture of his ex mr @entity16 says mr @entity11 did indeed recreate the original shoot four years later with ms @entity12 , who was then 18 and the photographer 's girlfriend			1
but the image that went global and adorned boys ' walls around the world was from the original set , insists mr @entity16 , and shows his ex-wife			2
a best - seller throughout the late 1970s and 1980s , @entity10 's @entity9 poster a worldwide impact			0
it was banned in several countries and even publicly torn to pieces in the @entity100 as an example of @entity103 sexual decadence			0
the girl in the photo , which remains popular to this day , remained anonymous until 1989 , when @entity12 stepped forward to announce that she was the face behind the behind			0
mr @entity11 's story is that the shot was taken at the now defunct @entity111 courts at @entity112 on a hazy september afternoon in 1976			2
chewed tennis balls belonging to miss @entity12 's dog were scattered across the court			0
mr @entity116 went on to sell the image rights to @entity10 but retained the copyright , earning him an estimated £ 250,000 in royalty payments			0
two million copies were sold worldwide			0
miss @entity12 , who is now mrs @entity121 and a mother - of - three , has previously said she had no regrets about posing for the photograph , even though she never earned a penny from it			0
but mr @entity16 believes she had been misled by mr @entity11			1
he says his ex-wife , to whom he was married between 1980 and 1986 , revealed to him during their relationship that she had posed for the photograph while working as a tennis coach			1
mr @entity11 , one of her pupils , talked her into posing for him in a photo shoot in 1972 , he says			1
the ' real ' @entity9 : @entity121 - née @entity12 - poses with an original copy of the poster his ex-wife wishes to remain anonymous , apparently because it was her word against the late mr @entity11 's , who had always refused to publicly acknowledge mr @entity16 's claims			1
but before his death five years ago , mr @entity11 met the pensioner , who lives near @entity140 , @entity34 , and allegedly admitted he had been lying			0
' he confessed i to me - but i ca n't prove it , ' mr @entity16 said			0
' he said that he would give it me in writing , on a postcard , but it never arrived			0
' since mr @entity11 's death the royalties for the poster have been paid to his widow , @entity150			2
the late photographer has previously said of the image : ' if i had a pound for ever model that has laid claim to being the girl , and every photographer that has claimed they took the photo , i 'd be a very rich man			0

@entity16 claims his ex-wife was the photographer 's tennis coach
he says she told him she posed for a shoot with @entity11 in 1972
a postcard of the picture postmarked 1974 seems to back his claim
as does a 1974 calendar showing a photo apparently from the same *series*
