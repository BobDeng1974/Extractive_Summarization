every second of the day you are subjected to radiation from compounds in soil , buildings and even your own body			2
but for people who fly frequently , cosmic radiation can increase this exposure significantly			1
now there is an app that records your personal radiation to reveal how much you are exposed to from from medical examinations , changes in your location , and flights			1
the @entity21 app ( pictured ) was developed by @entity23 - based firm esooka and uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists			1
the £ 1.49 ( $ 1.99 ) @entity28 app keeps a record of a user 's personal radiation including exposure from changes in a person 's location and flights the @entity21 app was developed by @entity23 - based esooka			1
it uses a mathematical model developed by scientists and meteorologists from the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) in @entity23 and the @entity43 , @entity44			1
since 1997 , @entity42 has studied the cosmic radiation at typical flight altitudes and used this to calculate radiation levels			2
to to do this , @entity42 's scientists developed a carry - on ' flight case '			1
using the case , @entity42 's scientists measured more than 2,500 points at flight altitudes between 5 miles ( 8km ) and 7.5 miles ( 12km ) worldwide between 1997 and 2006			1
this covered geographical location , the flight altitude and solar activity			2
6 @entity59 : typical radiation from a dentist 's x-ray 10 @entity59 : average daily natural radiation 40 @entity59 : radiation from flying from @entity65 to @entity66 100 @entity59 : radiation from a 10 - hour flight across the @entity69 2,100 @entity59 : annual radiation of a typical person in @entity72 3,000 @entity59 : radiation from a mammogram 3,600 @entity59 : average annual radiation of a @entity77 citizen 50,000 @entity59 : maximum allowable yearly occupational dose in the @entity77 100,000 @entity59 : lowest yearly dose linked to increased risk of cancer 2,000,000 @entity59 : severe and potentially fatal it can measure all the relevant types of radiation , in particular neutron radiation produced in the atmosphere			1
using the @entity21 app , users enter the details of the airports they are flying from and to and the date they are travelling			1
the current solar activity for the flight is then inputted , using a neutron monitor of the @entity97 in @entity44			0
in addition to tracking cosmic radiation from air travel , the app accounts for gamma radiation and cosmic radiation on the ground and medical examinations with ionizing radiation such as x-rays or ct scans lead to radiation exposure			1
the measurement is called the ' ambient dose equivalent ' and is recorded in microsieverts ( @entity59 )			0
in the @entity77 , this is often measured in a unit called rem and one sievert is equivalent to 100 rem			0
a ten - hour flight across the @entity69 , for instance , results in a radiation exposure of between 50 @entity59 to 100 @entity59			1
by comparison , an x-ray at a dentist exposes patients to 6 @entity59 , depending on the type of x-ray			0
in 2012 , the total annual radiation exposure of a typical person in @entity72 , through naturally occurring radiation , came to about 2,100 @entity59			1
the same year a radiation monitor tracked @entity132 per hour at the site of the @entity135 power plant			2
while the average radiation of someone in the @entity77 is @entity138			2
experts studied the cosmic radiation at flight altitudes between 5 miles ( 8km ) and 7.5 miles ( 12km ) worldwide between 1997 and 2006			2
a @entity21 user enters their flights details and solar activity for the flight is inputted , using a neutron monitor from the @entity97 in @entity44 a 10 - hour flight over the @entity69 , for instance , results in a radiation exposure of between 50 @entity59 to 100 @entity59			1
by comparison , an x-ray ( stock image right ) exposes patients to @entity155 - depending on the x-ray , while a mammogram ( right ) produces 3,000 @entity59			2
a dosage of 2,000,000 @entity59 is considered severe and potentially fatal airline pilots are at risk of deadly skin cancer because they are exposed to cockpit radiation similar to levels from tanning beds			0
pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed			0
and researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields , which can reflect uv radiation a team from the @entity175 measured the amount of uv radiation in airplane cockpits during flights			1
the cockpit radiation was measured in the pilot seat of a general aviation turboprop airplane through the acrylic plastic windshield at ground level and at various heights above sea level			0
@entity188 exposures were measured in @entity189 , @entity190 , and in @entity191 around midday in april			0
they then compared them with measurements taken in tanning beds			0
while short - wave @entity199 ultraviolet radiation can not easily penetrate glass and plastic windows , long - wave uv - a is much more likely to get through			1
both kinds of @entity204 can cause skin ageing and cancer			0
approximately half of this dose comes from x-rays , mammograms , ct scans and similar			0
the other , natural half occurs from radioactive compounds in soil and building materials like concrete and brick			0
the small amount of mineral potassium in the human body is also radioactive			0
of this natural radiation , around nine per cent comes from cosmic radiation			0
particles from space interact with the atmosphere and @entity227 's magnetic field to generate cosmic radiation			1
sources are said to include gamma ray bursts , solar flares and supernovae			0
it is what 's known as ionising , which means particles can alter charged particles from atoms that can potentially cause chemical changes in body tissue			0
exposure to this kind of radiation is more significant at higher latitudes and near the magnetic poles , and many planes take polar routes to cut journey times			1
this exposure is so significant that in 1994 @entity77 pilots and cabin crew were classified as ' radiation workers ' and the maximum allowable yearly occupational does is 50,000 @entity59			2
last year researchers from the @entity175 found that pilots flying for an hour at 30,000ft get the same amount of radiation as 20 minutes on a tanning bed			0
and researchers believe the levels could be higher when pilots are flying over thick clouds and snow fields , which can reflect uv radiation the lowest yearly dose that has been linked to an increase in cancer risk is 100,000 @entity59 , while a dosage of 2,000,000 @entity59 is considered severe and potentially fatal .			0
