by @entity0 of all the kangaroos who live at @entity5 's @entity4 in @entity6 , @entity1 is by far the most affectionate			1
but when @entity7 noticed the big red licking and nuzzling certain spots on her body , she did n't realise the six - year - old was trying to get a message across			1
' i 'd been meaning to get them checked for ages , and i just kept forgetting , ' @entity5 told the @entity16 , talking about some small lesions which she had come across a month or so earlier			1
@entity7 had her life saved by her kangaroo @entity1 after she sniffed out cancerous spots on her face and body			1
she is pictured caring for a new arrival at the orphanage ' she concentrated on these spots , one on my hand , one on my foot and one on my face			0
' she was on a mission to tell me something			0
' when @entity5 finally took notice of @entity1 , saw a doctor and got the spots checked out , she could n't believe what the kangaroo had alerted her to			1
she had three cancerous spots removed from the places on her body @entity1 had been paying attention to , and an additional spot biopsied on her face			2
@entity1 , a six - year - old red kangaroo , paid special attention to spots on @entity5 's face and body which led to her having them checked out and removed the 63 - year - old was lucky to catch the @entity52 cell carcinomas when she did , left any longer and they could have turned much nastier			1
' they 're non-aggressive but still need to be removed			0
they start eating your flesh away if you leave them , ' @entity5 revealed			0
the 63 - year - old had one spot removed and another biopsied on her face , and will undergo surgery in july to completely remove all the cancers ' i 've heard of people who had one on their ear and had to have half their ear removed			0
' though she still needs to undergo surgery in july to completely remove the lesions , the wildlife carer is amazed that @entity1 , who has been at her and husband @entity72 's orphanage since she was a joey , was able to detect the cancer			1
' we 're still in awe ourselves - because if it had n't been for @entity1 i would n't have got it checked out			2
' however , this is not the first time @entity1 has saved a life			0
three and a half years ago , @entity72 had a series of strokes			2
during that time @entity5 said @entity1 , who is normally a ' mummy 's girl ' , paid more attention than usual to her husband			1
big red kangaroos are the most common species in the @entity6 area , where @entity5 and @entity72 run their own art gallery and wildlife orphanage			1
' they 're big sooks , they 're very affectionate , very calm , such a lovely temperament , ' @entity5 revealed			0
' [ but ] prior to him having the strokes we noticed that @entity1 was paying him so much attention , was being a real daddy 's girl			2
' she was licking his arm , lay down next to him			0
but we did n't put two and two together			0
the kangaroo orphanage mostly takes in joeys whose mothers have been hunted or died in road accidents @entity5 ( left ) and @entity72 ( right ) have been caring for wildlife for many years , and opened up their current refuge in 2007 as it turned out , @entity72 was very unwell and @entity1 had sensed a small stroke which was then followed by a larger one			1
' some people who suffer from epilepsy have dogs that alert them when they 're going to have a seizure , maybe it 's like that , ' @entity5 said			2
' i do n't even know that they smell it , i think that they sense			0
' speaking of @entity1 's discovery , the wildlife lover admitted that her and @entity72 would certainly be paying greater attention to the kangaroo 's intuition from now on			1
' we 'll probably be walking on eggshells every time one of them gives us a kiss or cuddle , ' she joked			0
' @entity1 's living up to her name - she is certainly beautiful			2
' @entity1 is one of the most affectionate kangaroos , but also very cheeky , seen her napping in a pile of washing she messed up			0

@entity7 had four skin cancers removed after her kangaroo @entity1 detected them
three years earlier the red kangaroo sensed @entity5 's husband @entity72 having a stroke
the couple run an art gallery and kangaroo orphanage in @entity6 , @entity152
@entity5 is ' still in awe ' and believes @entity1 ' sensed ' she was unwell
