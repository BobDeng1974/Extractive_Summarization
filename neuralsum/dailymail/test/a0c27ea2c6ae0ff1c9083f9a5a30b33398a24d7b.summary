bereaved families say the report is being dragged out so figures like @entity3 can rebut its findings the families of @entity8 ’s @entity7 war dead expressed their disgust last night after learning the long - awaited official report into the conflict may be delayed yet again			1
publication of sir @entity14 ’s inquiry , which began in 2009 and has cost the taxpayer almost £ 10million , had already been pushed back until after the election			1
yesterday it emerged it is unlikely to be published until next year at the earliest			1
bereaved parents said they were disgusted that their suffering was being dragged out to give leading figures in the inquiry , like @entity3 , the chance to rebut its findings			1
they added they were now expecting a whitewash when the report is finally published			1
earlier this year it emerged the report , expected to criticise dozen of senior figures involved in the 2003 conflict , had been pushed back until after the election because it was too politically sensitive to publish so close to a national poll			1
but sources close to the investigation have now told @entity37 ’s @entity36 that ‘ nobody thinks it will come out this year ’			0
in comments that caused anger among military families , the sources suggested that ‘ once they had failed to meet the pre-election deadline , they gave up trying to speed things up ’			1
further delays will fuel speculation that those criticised are trying to bury damning revelations			0
last night @entity50 , whose son @entity51 , 19 , was killed in @entity7 in 2004 , told the @entity52 : ‘ i ’m actually disgusted			2
i now definitely do feel like i am being fobbed off			0
how long do we have to wait ? it has been 11 years since @entity51 died and they are dragging it out for all the families			2
’ @entity56 , whose 20 - year - old son @entity57 died in 2003 , said : ‘ we were told from sir @entity14 that it would be a robust and thorough inquiry and we would get the answers we were looking for			1
this @entity62 inquiry is like an open wound and we need those answers			2
to have to wait until 2016 for them is just ridiculous			2
’ mr @entity56 , 62 , added he thought the final report would likely be ‘ watered down ’			0
@entity68 foreign affairs spokesman @entity67 said speculation about a delay was ‘ deeply concerning ’			2
he added : ‘ hundreds of thousands of families have had their lives torn apart by the @entity73 and deserve answers			2
it is simply not good enough for this process to be continually delayed and the report must be published			0
’ the findings have been held up by the process of ‘ @entity80 ’ – giving individuals in the report a chance to respond			0
@entity36 ’s diplomatic editor @entity84 said it had become a ‘ nightmare ’ , with some of those criticised given drafts running to ‘ hundreds of pages ’			0
delayed : sir @entity14 ( pictured ) began his inquiry in 2009			1
it has cost the taxpayer almost £ 10million , with the findings unlikely to be published until next year at the earliest , it has emerged mr @entity3 has previously denied responsibility for hold - ups to the inquiry – which stopped taking evidence in 2011			1
but bereaved families say they are now expecting a whitewash when the report is finally published wrangling between the inquiry and cabinet secretary sir @entity100 over the publication of @entity103 conversations and communications between @entity3 and president @entity105 has also caused delays			1
@entity107 , 53 , whose son @entity108 , 18 , was one of the youngest to die , told the @entity52 : ‘ it is a total whitewash , i think the longer that it has gone , the longer it is giving people a chance to change their responses			0
it is all lies , lies , lies			0
i do n’t think anybody will get an answer from it			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity119 said he was ‘ dismayed beyond belief that we are having to wait so long – and now , it is being reported , even longer than i had feared – to finally find out the truth of what happened			0
’ mr @entity3 has previously denied responsibility for hold - ups to the inquiry – which stopped taking evidence in 2011			1
neither the government nor the inquiry would comment on any delays .			0
