the first time i saw the young @entity3 bowl , in a televised match for @entity5 , i turned to the @entity7 producer and asked if the speed gun was working properly			1
he assured me it was			0
it said he was bowling at 90mph			0
back then he used to just bowl as fast as he could			0
since then , @entity3 has become an artist — and has answered every question posed of him			1
he put them to bed ; @entity3 can only bowl in @entity19 conditions , it was said			1
it has to swing for him to prosper , it was said			0
now he is rapidly approaching sir @entity26 ’s @entity25 wicket record and has the capacity to go well past 400 wickets			1
@entity32 folk tend not to speak until they ’re spoken to and they weigh up strangers before deciding whether they are worth talking to			0
they have a dry sense of humour			0
@entity44 once said to me : ‘ what can you tell me about this lad @entity3 ? he never says anything			2
’ i said : ‘ @entity50 , you played in the @entity5 @entity51 just up the road			0
you know what they ’re like ! ’ all of which makes @entity3 ’s attitude on the pitch such a contrast			1
to me , he is just like @entity60			0
but @entity3 does not get sidetracked if he loses his rag with someone			2
@entity3 has come a very long way from his @entity32 days			2
and maybe sometimes , like at @entity66 this season , he really does think of himself as the @entity67 ! consider the best fast bowlers @entity69 have had and you think of @entity71 , @entity26 and @entity72			1
well , @entity3 is right up there with them and i ’m thrilled for him			2
i imagine @entity3 is a captain ’s dream because he just gets on with his job			1
he 's up there with the best ever ! @entity3 is similar to @entity81 legend @entity60			1

@entity29 's *premier* bowler has been *fantastic* against @entity33
@entity3 closing in on sir @entity26 ’s @entity25 wicket record
@entity69 *hoping* to seal a series win against @entity33 at the @entity88
