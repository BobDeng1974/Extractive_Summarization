@entity0 drew his first @entity2 derby 1 - 1 in a hard - fought game at @entity4			1
he saw his @entity5 take a third minute lead through top scorer @entity7 but they were pegged back in the second half and despite facing 10 men for the last 10 minutes had to settle for a point			1
the start could not have been better for @entity0			1
he has been urging his full - backs to overlap even giving them the example of @entity15 to follow and when the goal came on three minutes it was a run from right - back @entity18 that started the move			2
he overlapped down the right and crossed for @entity21			0
the @entity23 striker made poor contact with his header but when the ball ran to the other flank @entity26 jinked to the byline and crossed for @entity7 to head past @entity30			1
team - mates rush to congratulate @entity7 after the @entity32 forward put @entity5 in the lead @entity34 equalised for @entity35 in the second - half on sunday night @entity0 issues instructions to @entity21 during the game at @entity4 @entity5 : @entity39 , @entity7 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 ( @entity45 64 ) , @entity46 ( @entity47 64 ) @entity26 , @entity7 , @entity21 subs not used : @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 scorer : @entity7 3 @entity35 : @entity30 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 60 ) , @entity63 ( @entity64 81 ) , @entity65 , @entity66 ( @entity67 78 ) subs not used : @entity69 , @entity18 , @entity70 , @entity71 booked : @entity57 sent off : @entity58 scorer : @entity55 61 athletic could have doubled their lead on 11 mintues when @entity75 headed @entity77 corner just wide			1
@entity35 were struggling to contend with @entity7 and former @entity79 defender @entity78 was booked for clattering the @entity32 striker			1
@entity7 was thrown up in the air again from a challenge with @entity56			2
he was a constant threat and had he , and not his strike partner @entity21 , been on the end of @entity77 ’s cross moments later it would have been 2 - 0			2
the @entity23 is completely lacking in confidence and headed woefully wide			0
@entity5 were not having it all their own way and @entity65 twice tested @entity39			0
he also got down well to his right to save @entity63 free - kick but @entity35 remained in the ascendancy until half time			0
@entity26 shot was saved by @entity30 and @entity7 had the whole of the @entity96 on their feet with a mazy run and shot that deserved a goal			2
@entity35 took the game to the home side in the second half but @entity5 were able to break quickly with the pass of @entity46			2
he was fed by @entity77 but when the cross came in again @entity21 was unable to finish			0
there was always a good chance that they were going to pay for such sloppy finishing and on the hour the equalizer came			0
@entity63 sent a curling cross to the back post and right back @entity34 arrived with perfect timing and conviction to volley past @entity39			1
@entity44 fights for the ball with opposing striker @entity65 at @entity4 @entity43 attempts to tackle @entity35 youngster @entity66 on sunday night @entity118 had not been the same side in the second side			1
@entity63 had time to measure his cross and @entity55 ’ energy to meet the centre from his full - back position ahead of @entity5 full back @entity126 was also telling			0
@entity0 must have feared total capitulation just a week after his team conceded four in the second half against @entity130 but they were up against ten men from 79 minutes onwards when @entity35 centre - back @entity58 was sent off for a second yellow card			1
he elbowed @entity77 as the both jumped for a header and deserved to go			0
@entity5 almost took immediate advantage when a run from @entity46 forced a free - kick on the edge of the area and substitute @entity47 thundered it on to the bar			0
there was still time for @entity144 to squander another chance with a shot well saved by @entity30			0
derby games were never kind to @entity0 in @entity148			1
he lost his first one as @entity151 manager 4 - 1			0
this was an improvement on that – and against @entity156 opponents – but he he will know with better finishing it could have been even better			0
@entity7 holds off the challenge of @entity159 as he looks to make ground in attack @entity0 shouts from the bench during his first @entity2 derby on sunday night			1

@entity7 scored after just three minutes at the @entity4
@entity32 forward headed in a cross after neat play on the right
but @entity34 equalised in the second half
@entity58 sent off with 10 minutes remaining for *visitors*
but @entity0 ' side could *n't* find *winner* in his first @entity2 derby
