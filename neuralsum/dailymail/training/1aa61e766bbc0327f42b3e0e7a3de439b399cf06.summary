not so long ago she was wiggling her way around the clubs of @entity3 as an unknown burlesque dancer			0
then , in a dramatic twist of fate , in 2011 @entity5 discovered she was a distant cousin of one of the most famous women in the world : the @entity7			1
since her discovery , the stripper has pocketed herself six - figure sums posing for a variety of raunchy magazines - including @entity15 - and performing her risque burlesque act across the globe			2
now , her latest magazine shoot , which shows her posing in barely there underwear , proves that she may be related to the future @entity22 - but her behaviour could n't be further apart			2
royal connections : @entity5 , the duchess of @entity26 's second cousin once removed , bared all in her interview with @entity28 @entity7 's racy 22 - year - old relative has shaken off the shackles of regal decorum in her scantily clad shoot for loaded magazine			1
@entity34 , who was revealed ahead of the @entity35 to be @entity7 's second cousin , once removed , poses naked with peroxide blonde hair for the new issue of men 's magazine loaded			1
and the stripper even lets rip at @entity7 's new family in a sensational interview			1
@entity44 all : the 22 - year - old stripper did n't hold back in the interview and proved how comfortable she was in her own skin by posing in next to nothing speaking about her cousin 's father - in - law , the outspoken bombshell said : ' i think prince @entity54 has done a lot of good for people			1
it ’s his prerogative who he dates			0
' some men are like that			0
you ca n’t polish a turd			0
' and she did n't stop at @entity54			2
miss @entity5 also added that she is n't attracted to loveable ginger @entity64 and would n't want to see his ' tackle , ' as she ever so gracefully puts it			1
but if there is one person the tattooed former @entity71 bank employee has some sympathy for her cousin @entity7 , particularly following the publication of her private holiday photographs			1
a born performer : @entity77 began learning burlesque dancing at a young age and performed for the first time topless at age eighteen she told the magazine : ' she was on private land and comfortable being in her own skin			2
' i do n't think she should be scrutinised for being comfortable in her own skin			0
' @entity77 , who hails from the @entity87 , certainly has no hang - ups of her own in that regard			0
she explains that she has always been comfortable with her own body - something that led her to learning the art of burlesque			0
indeed , so comfortable was she that she even performed topless at the tender age of 18 in front of her family			0
sympathy : the stripper has sympathy with her cousin @entity7 , especially after private photographs of her in holiday surfaced ' i do n't feel undressed when i 'm not wearing clothes			1
i feel very comfortable , ' she added			0
@entity34 , who has never made any attempt to contact the @entity109 , previously insisted that she had been a burlesque dancer for years and the recent success and attention is just a happy coincidence			0
the full interview with photographs are in this month 's @entity28			1
