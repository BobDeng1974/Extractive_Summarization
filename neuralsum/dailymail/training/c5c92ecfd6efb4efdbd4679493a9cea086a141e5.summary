by @entity0 the only way is up : @entity3 's new job as head of a charity in the @entity6 is likely to likely to be five times higher than his salary as a @entity9 mp when he swaps @entity10 for @entity11 , @entity3 will be earning more than president @entity12			1
as head of the @entity15 , his pay package is likely to be about £ 300,000 – nearly five times higher than his wage as a @entity9 mp			1
on top of his salary comes complimentary private health care , a gold - plated , tax - free pension and a host of other perks			1
the @entity15 said mr @entity3 ’s pay was ‘ private ’ yesterday , but the organisation ’s outgoing president got £ 295,000 a year for a 37 - and - a - half hour week			1
and , as a former foreign secretary who counts the @entity30 and @entity31 as close friends , mr @entity3 was in a position to command an even more generous deal			0
the @entity15 ’s money comes mainly from grants from taxpayers – including £ 110million of @entity39 aid over the last ten years			1
but from the moment he steps into his well - appointed office , near @entity43 ’s @entity42 , mr @entity3 will be in charge of a vast humanitarian organisation			0
it has 12,000 staff , and spent £ 240million on its programmes last year			0
yet despite the scale of his new job , mr @entity3 is understood to be keeping his lucrative sideline as a director of @entity54 – for which he is paid £ 125,000 for 15 days work			2
the @entity15 , founded at the request of @entity58 in 1933 , helps refugees from 40 countries including @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			2
it is a highly - regarded charity and its directors and ‘ overseers ’ include @entity65 and former @entity67 chief @entity66			2
mr @entity3 is likely to have been offered a number of perks to take up the role			2
these could include a housing allowance , limo allowance and health club membership			0
‘ it is not unusual for the charities to offer help with housing for someone who is moving to @entity43 for the first time , ’ said @entity76 , who has studied the pay of charity leaders for @entity6 watchdog @entity79			0
mr @entity3 ’s salary will be complemented by an estimated £ 8,000 towards private health insurance and a further £ 22,000 a year payment towards his pension			1
a former @entity15 insider said : ‘ he will have a big office in a nice part of @entity43			2
‘ it has a desk with big windows looking out over the city , and a large settee with space for several people to have informal meetings			0
pastures new : @entity3 announced he is quitting politics to become head of a charity in @entity43 connections : as a former foreign secretary who counts the @entity30 as friends , @entity3 was likely to have commanded an even higher salary than his predecessor ‘ @entity3 will be treated as a senior global executive , and in @entity6 such people are revered			2
they have big responsibilities and although they need to have that self - belief they are here to help people , basically they are not doing it “ for charity ”			0
‘ it ’s a big operation and you have got to be on the ball			0
@entity120 : the @entity15 charity was set up by @entity58 ‘ there is a huge competition for funding among aid agencies whenever there is an emergency , and this is where somebody of @entity3 ’s calibre will have the confidence to go into meetings with top people and make them get their chequebooks out			1
’ about two - thirds of the @entity15 ’s £ 260million annual funding comes from @entity6 taxpayers , but over the past ten years @entity39 has donated £ 110million			1
since leaving government , mr @entity3 has earned nearly £ 1million on top of his £ 65,000 mp ’s salary			1
commanding up to £ 20,000 as a speaker , his earnings total £ 985,315 including travel and accommodation for himself and his staff , according to the most recently published commons register			0
flying around the globe , from the @entity6 to the @entity150 , he took more than £ 64,400 from the advisory board of the @entity153 ministry of foreign affairs , and £ 90,000 from the @entity156 - based @entity155 investment firm advising on international energy opportunities			0
he even charged £ 7,650 for a cancelled speech to the @entity159			0
but now mr @entity3 is joining a charity , he could feel under pressure to lead by example – and may be interested to know that in 2007 his predecessor at the @entity15 , @entity164 , and his wife , @entity165 , personally donated $ 1million – worth three years ’ wages .			1
