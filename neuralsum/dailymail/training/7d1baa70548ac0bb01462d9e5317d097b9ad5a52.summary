@entity1 fans who made the 630 - mile round trip to see their side humiliated 8 - 0 by @entity4 are set to receive just £ 24 each in compensation from the players			1
in the aftermath of their embarrassing defeat , goalkeeper @entity7 vowed to speak to his team - mates about refunding the 2,600 supporters who made the journey			1
many had paid £ 152.50 for a return train ticket , but they are set to receive just £ 24 to cover the cost of the ticket for the game and not their rail fare			1
the logistics of working out how much each fan was owed depending on how they got to @entity32 would prove too complicated to refund them for travel			2
the worst moment of the afternoon was when @entity36 scored one of the own goals of the season with a first - time volley , from the edge of the box , past his own goalkeeper			2
that goal , in only the 12th minute , set the tone for the game before @entity1 capitulated to one of the worst defeats in @entity50 history			2
@entity51 celebrates the fifth goal with @entity53 as @entity4 ran riot but the defender has apologised to the club ’s supporters and admitted his mistake had a huge impact on the way the game went			1
@entity36 said : ‘ i take full responsibility for this and after my error the game really did change			0
‘ the account we gave of ourselves was embarrassing			0
we have to look forward now and try to improve for the following game			0
‘ i thank the fans for their excellent support as always and i would really like to say sorry to them for the very poor account we have given of ourselves			0
‘ the first step is to accept the errors we committed and we have to be aware that we are responsible for what happened here			0
