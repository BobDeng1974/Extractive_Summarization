ministers yesterday backed controversial new @entity5 flying hours rules to be imposed on @entity11			1
new transport secretary @entity12 was accused of ‘ rolling over to @entity13 ’ after his department approved the rules despite the concerns raised in a report by the respected commons ’ @entity19			2
jet lag : controversial new rules on flying hours imposed by the @entity5 could see pilots dozing off in the cockpit during flights , pilots ' groups have warned under the new rules , pilots could be landing commercial jets after 22 hours awake - including 11 hours flying , plus stand - by time and travel to the airport			1
mps had warned in their original report that 22 hours of wakefulness was ‘ an extraordinary figure ’ - particularly for night flying - that raised levels of fatigue equivalent to being ‘ drunk			1
’ currently @entity11 pilots are limited to 18 hours without sleep - but more than 4 out of ten pilots ( 43 per cent ) already report nodding off in - flight - of whom a third ( 31 per cent ) awoke to find their co-pilot also asleep , mps heard in evidence			1
despite this , the @entity47 yesterday insisted the @entity5 blueprint would neither compromise safety nor increase the risk of pilot fatigue			0
new transport secretary @entity12 was accused of ¿ rolling over to @entity53 after his department approved the rules in its official response to the mp ’s report published yesterday the @entity56 defended its backing of the @entity5 flying hours plan and insisted : ‘ the government believes that the current draft of the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) proposals will not lead to a diminution of safety in the @entity11			1
‘ the proposals are more conservative than current @entity5 rules which were introduced in 2008 and will result in a significant improvement in safety across the @entity5 as a whole			0
’ but the @entity71 ( @entity72 ) has written to mr @entity12 urging him to ‘ think again ’			0
a @entity72 spokesman said : ‘ it is clear that the government has chosen to ignore the concerns of thousands of pilots in the @entity11			1
it looks like the government are going to roll over to @entity13 on this			0
‘ @entity81 want @entity11 pilots flying more tired more often			1
so the @entity75 response is extremely disappointing			0
we hope the new transport secretary will change course			0
’ the row centres around new rules laid out by the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) which was mandated four years ago by @entity13 to ‘ harmonise ’ flight time limits and shift - patterns across the @entity5			1
since the row erupted , @entity13 has signalled it may compromise on 20 hours			0
and despite accepting the new rules the government did accept some of the mp ’s findings - including a recommendation to investigate ‘ the potential under - reporting of pilot fatigue ’			2
ministers said they would also be seeking a strengthening of specific @entity5 ‘ fatigue ’ rules surrounding flight duties and rest periods and ‘ stricter limits ’ on how frequently airlines could use discretion to exceed maximum levels			0
transport committee chairman @entity107 , @entity109 mp for @entity110 , said of the government ’s response : ‘ there are still areas of concern			0
the proof will be in their actions			0
’ a @entity47 spokesman said : ‘ the safety of the travelling public is paramount and we have been quite clear that we would not support any proposals which the @entity11 ’s safety regulator - the @entity126 - advise do not provide sufficient protection against crew fatigue			2
‘ we are still awaiting @entity65 ’s final proposals , but the @entity126 is satisfied that the latest draft rules now provide a level of safety broadly equivalent to those already in place in the @entity11			2

under the new rules , pilots could be landing commercial jets after 22 hours awake
currently @entity11 pilots are limited to 18 hours without sleep
but more than four out of ten pilots already report nodding off in - flight
