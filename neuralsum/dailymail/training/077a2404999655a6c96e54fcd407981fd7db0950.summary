@entity0 failed to mention the 15 kilometres of water and mud between the tourists and their destination car had to be abandoned as the tide came in by @entity7 published : 05:52 est , 16 march 2012 updated : 07:33 est , 16 march 2012 three @entity9 tourists holidaying in @entity10 came unstuck when their satnav told them they could drive from the mainland to an island – failing to mention the 15 kilometres of water and mud in between			1
as they drove their hired car from @entity17 in @entity18 to nearby @entity19 they started to notice the firm gravel surface they were driving on giving way to the renowned bay mangrove mud			1
however , confident their satnav would direct them to a road soon , they decided to plough on , managing to travel around 500 metres before their @entity24 was up to its axles in mud			2
oops ! : as the tied started to come in , the @entity9 tourists had to abandon their hired car , retrieving some of their valuables first to make matters worse the tide started to come in and soon forced them to seek help and abandon the vehicle			1
just four hours later the car was stranded in two metres of water – to the great amusement of onlookers on the shore and passengers on passing boats and ferries			1
@entity43 , 21 , said she was listening to the gps and ‘ it told us we could drive down there			0
‘ it kept saying it would navigate us to a road			0
we got stuck … there ’s lots of mud			2
’ difficult driving conditions : the tide comes up so high that soon ferries start to pass by the abandoned car sight for sore eyes : passengers on passing boats and ferries were amused when they saw a little stranded @entity24 in the ocean she and her travel companions @entity64 , 22 , and @entity65 , 21 , instead had to ditch their plans for a day trip to the island and headed back to the @entity70 courtesy of a lift from the @entity73 tow truck driver who was called to the stranded car			1
no such luck for the hired car though – after assessing the situation no attempt was made to recover it			2
a four wheel drive owner who saw the incident had considered winching out the car , but abandoned any attempt due to the speed of the oncoming tide			1
plan b : the tourists had to abandon their car and day trip plans when their vehicle became bogged down in mangrove mud the students from @entity94 who are due to return home tomorrow , said the experience would not put them off returning to @entity10 for another visit			1
' we want to come back to @entity10 again			0
everyone is very nice , even today , ' ms @entity43 said			0
remaining upbeat , mr @entity64 joked that the car may have got stuck because it was built in @entity100			0
‘ maybe if it was @entity9 it would be okay , ’ he said			0
scuppered : the three tourists had to rethink their day trip plans , but are keen to return to @entity10 for another visit he added : ‘ it has rained every day on our six day holiday			0
hopefully next time we come back it will be sunny			0
’ the car was covered by insurance , but the tourists will have to pay up about $ 1500 in excess charges .			2
