a megachurch pastor who called women ' penis homes ' has resigned amid allegations of bullying and corruption			0
@entity6 , stepped down from his position as elder and lead pastor at @entity10 , @entity11 , after a group of church elders recently ended an investigation into a series of formal charges brought against him			1
announcing the decision on the church 's website on wednesday , he said : ' it would be best for the health of our family , and for the @entity10 family , that we step aside from further ministry at the church			1
' @entity6 , pictured in 2007 , resigned from his position as lead pastor after allegations of bullying @entity6 , whose church grew to attract more than 12,000 at branches across five states , took a leave of absence in august so church leaders could investigate whether he was fit to lead after accusations that he bullied members , threatened opponents , lied and oversaw mismanagement of church funds , the @entity31 reported			1
but the church 's board said on its website that @entity6 was not asked to resign , and they were surprised to receive his resignation			1
his resignation letter , which was obtained by @entity48 , said : ' recent months have proven unhealthy for our family -- even physically unsafe at times -- and we believe the time has now come for the elders to choose new pastoral leadership for @entity10			1
' there are many things i have confessed and repented of , privately and publicly , as you are well aware			0
specifically , i have confessed to past pride , anger and a domineering spirit			0
' domineering spirit : pastor @entity6 wrote that women were created to give homes to men 's penises the board @entity6 has been ' guilty of arrogance , responding to conflict with a quick temper and harsh speech , and leading the staff and elders in a domineering manner			1
' the board said that while it believes @entity6 needs to address those areas in his life , ' we do not believe him to be disqualified from pastoral ministry			2
' the church noted that @entity6 , the only pastor it has known since it was founded 18 years ago , was never charged with immorality , illegality or heresy			1
it said most of the charges involved the domineering style of leadership , and that they found some accusations ' unfair or untrue			1
' @entity6 founded his megachurch , 18 years ago			2
it has branches across five states but some have been forced to close last month a phone and email message left with the church was not immediately returned wednesday afternoon			2
other charges had previously been addressed by @entity6 , the church noted			1
in 2001 , under a pseudonym , @entity103 , @entity6 wrote : ' the first thing to know about your penis is , that despite the way it may see , it is not your penis			2
ultimately , @entity110 created you and it is his penis			0
you are simply borrowing it for a while			0
' while his penis is on loan you must admit that it is sort of just hanging out there very lonely as if it needed a home , sort of like a man wondering the streets looking for a house to live in			0
' knowing that his penis would need a home , @entity110 created a woman to be your wife and when you marry her and look down you will notice that your wife is shaped differently than you and makes a very nice home			0
' therefore , if you are single you must remember that your penis is homeless and needs a home			0
though you may believe your hand is shaped like a home , it is not , ' he wrote			0
' and , though women other than your wife may look like a home , to rest there would be breaking into another man 's home			0
' the best - selling author has been accused of plagiarism and criticized for his stance against homosexuality and female preachers			2
in july , @entity6 apologized for crude comments he made posting under an alias in an online discussion forum in 2000			2
and last month , his church was forced to close several of its branches after comments @entity6 made calling women ' penis homes ' emerged online			1
since 1996 , the church has grown quickly to attract thousands of followers in 15 branches in five states			2
last month , the church announced it was closing some of its branches and making plans to lay off dozens of employees			0
the @entity31 reported that financial problems in the wake of falling attendance forced the cutbacks			0
combined attendance at all @entity10 branches had dropped from more than 12,000 a week at the start of the year to less than 9,000 , a church spokesman said last month			1
the board now is planning for the future			0
' we would ask for patience as we now make plans for the first transition of pastoral leadership in the history of @entity10 , ' the church 's board said on its website .			1
