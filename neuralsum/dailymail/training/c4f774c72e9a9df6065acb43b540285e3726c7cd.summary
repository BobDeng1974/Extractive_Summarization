mr @entity2 admitted the @entity4 are in a ' critical state ' but he was trying to ' breed and train a bunch of nutters ' willing to work tirelessly to defy the opinion polls and win elections			1
despite being rocked by sex and court scandals , he claimed the party had the resilience and ability to survive of ' cockroaches ' but warned : ' one day someone will stand on us if we are not careful			0
@entity24 : @entity4 president @entity2 warned the party was in a ' critical state ' and future survival could not be guaranteed as the @entity4 prepare for their spring conference in @entity29 , starting tonight , mr @entity2 warned the party faithful that they can not take their future survival for granted			1
it comes as a new poll shows fewer than a third of @entity4 voters at the last election plan to back the party again , a major poll reveals today			1
a survey commissioned by former @entity42 deputy chairman @entity41 suggests there is little room for complacency for @entity46 despite the by - election victory in @entity48 last week			0
mr @entity2 told parliamentary journal @entity50 : ' we are a bit like cockroaches after a nuclear war , just a bit less smelly , we are made of sterner stuff			2
survival : mr @entity2 said the party 's resilience is ' a bit like cockroaches after a nuclear war , just a bit less smelly ' ' the party is in a critical state			1
we may well be cockroach - ish , but we should n't take that for granted			0
one day someone will stand on us if we are not careful			0
we should n't assume our survival is guaranteed			0
' he said the party could not depend on safe seats , so anyone who chose to stand for election needed to be a ' nutter			0
' essentially we are trying to breed and train a bunch of nutters , absolutely dedicated and who have the skill set and understanding that what it takes is not just doing a good hustings , it ’s not just about being able to do a nice tv interview , it ’s actually about having the immense fighting spirit			0
' in recent weeks the party has been rocked by groping allegations - strongly denied by @entity88 - that women activists were sexually harassed by the former chief exeuctive			0
mr @entity2 - who previously appeared to make life difficult for the deputy prime minister by suggesting the party had ' screwed up ' - said the @entity4 ' certainly appear to have let people down ' but insisted it was crucial that they did not now go into ' institutional self - defence mode '			1
he added : ' i think 99 per cent of the people out there just do n't care , it 's not been raised			2
i 've done a lot of door knocking both in @entity48 and in my patch this last week			0
it was mentioned to me once , and that was in sympathy			0
' however , the @entity41 poll reveals the @entity4 have a real fight for survival			2
while many left - leaning former @entity4 voters want the party to be more vocal in opposing the @entity42 , such a move would put off more moderate , @entity115 - leaning voters who might otherwise stay with the party or even switch to it			1
research : there is little room for complacency for @entity46 despite the by - election victory in @entity48 last week , according to a survey commissioned by former @entity42 deputy chairman @entity41 ( right ) lord @entity41 ’s research , based on a poll of more than 20,000 voters , finds that only 29 per cent of those who voted @entity4 in 2010 say they would do so again tomorrow – just 5 per cent of the electorate			1
the other 71 per cent say they would vote for another party , or do n’t know			1
however , nearly a quarter of those who say they would vote @entity4 in an election tomorrow did not vote for the party in 2010 – indicating the party has picked up significant support since entering government			1
the party 's reputation for scandal has also been bolstered by both the @entity88 scandal and the resignation of cabinet minister @entity145 , who now faces jail after admitting perverting the course of justice over his wife @entity149 taking his speeding points			0
today sir @entity151 , the former @entity4 leader said : ' obviously we ’d have much preferred that neither of these things should have arisen			2
' but he told @entity155 : ' rumours of our death are grossly exaggerated			0
' according to the @entity41 poll , some 29 per cent of @entity4 voters in 2010 now say they would vote @entity160 or @entity161 – with many angry that the party joined the @entity163			1
another 8 per cent of 2010 @entity4 voters would now vote @entity115 , with 7 per cent backing @entity165			1
more than a fifth – 22 per cent – of those who voted @entity4 in 2010 do not know how they would vote tomorrow			1
though many have lost confidence in the @entity4 , they are resistant to @entity160 and do not know who to trust on the economy			2
the @entity4 ’ flagship economic policy – raising the income tax threshold to £ 10,000 – is backed by an overwhelming 85 per cent of voters , but four in ten think it was a @entity42 proposal			1
the most recognisable @entity4 policy is an amnesty for illegal migrants , which only 25 per cent of voters support and has not been implemented in government			1
lord @entity41 , who is now a leading pollster , said : ‘ after the @entity48 by - election @entity4 activists will be relieved to think that despite the polls , strong local government and an invincible leaflet - dropping network will see most of their mps safely back to @entity190			2
‘ but that is not the whole story			0
@entity194 matters , but a general election decides who walks up @entity197			0
@entity46 must have something to say about the @entity4 and government			0
’ lord @entity41 warned the @entity42 would learn the ‘ wrong lessons ’ from the @entity48 by - election if they chased the @entity165 vote as this would leave moderate and centre - right voters ‘ wide open to the @entity4 ’			2
