by @entity0 a @entity2 man has come up with an ingenious way to beat the thieves - winching his beloved motorbike up to his third floor window to lock it away safely at night			1
after having two motorbikes stolen in quick succession it seemed @entity10 , 56 , from @entity11 in @entity12 would have to give up on two - wheeled transport altogether			1
but when his wife joked that the only way to keep a bike safe would be to keep it indoors it gave him a flash of inspiration			2
he said : ' i had my first bike locked up with three padlocks but it was still stolen			0
' the second bike i bought i had only had a day , and was planning to buy extra strong padlocks for it , but it disappeared that night as well			0
safe and sound : mr @entity10 purchased an electric motor and connected it up to a steel cable which he fixed on the wall , and now every time he needs the bike he simply presses a button and lowers it down mr @entity10 's first bike was stolen from outside his apartment block despite being locked up with three padlocks			1
he had the second for just one day before that too was stolen investment : the heavy - duty winch that mr @entity10 uses to haul his motorbike to safety every night ' after that i decided i needed to come up with something else and my wife jokingly said the only safe place to keep it would be indoors â€“ and i thought why not ? ' then in the evening he winches the vehicle backup to the third floor balcony in his flat in the @entity2 city of @entity11 and sleeps well at night knowing that it is safe and will not be stolen			1
he said : ' it is not much more work than putting three padlocks on the bike , and it 's a lot more secure			0
' police in @entity11 said that motorbike theft was a growing problem with professional gangs targeting even low value machines which were usually quickly resold for their spare parts after being broken up			0
easy rider : mr @entity10 can sleep soundly at night knowing his motorbike is safe			2
