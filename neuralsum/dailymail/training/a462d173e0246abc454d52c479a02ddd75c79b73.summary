' the way people respond is remarkable			0
treehouses bring together families , friends and even entire communities , ' mr @entity2 told @entity53			1
this is certainly the case for mr @entity2 's family			1
his fascination with treehouses began when he was five - years - old and his father helped him build one			2

although treehouses are considered a den for children , mr @entity2 admits many of his customers are adults who are looking for a retreat from the world			1
' i get calls all the time for kids ’ treehouses			0
but i think the adults who are placing the calls are hiding the fact that the treehouse is for them , ' he told @entity89			2
' some people look at these treehouse books and say , " i want one of those "			2
or they ’re architecture buffs			0
they do n’t have the skills to create it , but they want it			0
' whereas mr @entity2 's first treehouse that he built with his father was a simple affair , his designs today are spectacular			1

the biggest was built on seven oaks in @entity131 , but it was destroyed in wildfires			0
' the owner said that after the wildfire , you could n’t fit the ashes in a bottle			0
it was that gone , ' mr @entity138 told the @entity89			0
an integral part of mr @entity2 's business is selecting the perfect tree or trees for his buildings			1
he says the @entity147 fir and red cedar trees are the best , being both strong and beautiful			0
' i think my greatest strength in this fun little biz is interpreting what they 're giving us , ' he said			0
however , the cottonwood is considered too dangerous to build in , mr @entity2 said , adding : ' on the most calm and beautiful days , there will be a gunshot sound , and a massive limb of a cottonwood tree will fall down			1
' mr @entity2 , who has produced coffee table books of his designs , added : ' the energy a tree emits is undeniable			2
it 's the sort of energy that makes the hairs stand up on your neck a little bit			0
' while mr @entity2 may be in an expert in picking the right tree to build around , his company must also negotiate planning regulations			2
@entity175 who wrote @entity176 , told @entity53 : ' some areas do n't consider treehouses to be a building at all , whereas others specifically mention them with maximum - height and floor - size limits			2
' mr @entity2 's love for treehouses has also led him to open a unique bed and breakfast in a @entity23 forest			1
with his wife @entity188 , he runs @entity189 , a collection of amazing lodges high in the trees , where people can stay , or hold weddings and concerts			0
hanging out : @entity2 and his son @entity72 work on a treehouse at @entity189 , the family 's holiday park while mr @entity2 's design cost anywhere between $ 80,000 and $ 200,000 to create , his passion for treehouses is such that he encourages like - minded people to create their own			1
websites such as @entity205 can be a great source of materials for a treehouse and , with a little help from the whole family , it should n't take long to create a retreat			0
' treehouses are priceless , especially the simple one that dad builds in the backyard , ' mr @entity2 said .			2
