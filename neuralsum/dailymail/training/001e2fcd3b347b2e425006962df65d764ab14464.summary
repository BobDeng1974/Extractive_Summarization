for all that they may exist at different levels , work with different budgets and different players , the challenge facing just about every single football manager is broadly the same			0
it is to be seen to be making progress or - at the very least - maintaining the status quo			1
as he tries to negotiate a way through his second season in @entity14 football , this is most certainly the challenge facing @entity16 manager @entity15			1
that is why what happened in the @entity19 on wednesday night may transpire to be so significant			1
during a season that has seen @entity16 struggle at times , @entity15 and his players have needed something to build on , something tangible			1
it is best to disregard the line credited to @entity16 chief executive @entity52 in the days before @entity15 was appointed in the summer of 2013			1
‘ five trophies in five seasons ’ was a handy soundbite but it was never meant to be taken seriously			0
@entity57 , at whatever level , is usually more nuanced than that			0
it is about results , of course , but it ’s also about progress made by individual players , about baby steps taken in different competitions			0
when the ever - admirable @entity38 sealed @entity16 ’s remarkable victory in the closing moments here , his team had secured something that had appeared beyond them for so long this season			1
@entity16 travelled to a hostile environment and saw off @entity27 , who have been impressive at home this season @entity78 punches clear as his defence held firm with @entity16 showing impressive savvy on the continent @entity78 picks up and displays an object hurled onto the pitch with the @entity27 fans showing partisan support @entity16 ’s manager has never admitted it publicly but a sense of stagnation has seemed to characterise the @entity14 champions at times this season			1
that may have worried him a little ahead of this game in @entity94			0
other managers in the @entity96 will feel this , too			0
@entity98 at @entity99 , certainly , and also @entity100 at @entity101			0
@entity15 , however , may have sensed something turn his way on wednesday night			1
city are @entity96 champions and still very much in touch with @entity106 at the top end of the table			0
now they are in the knockout stage of the @entity111 , too , and the restorative power of that achievement may be measured in full over the weeks to come			0
@entity114 currently the team they were this time last year ? the answer to that question has to be no , both in the manner of their football and their results			2
although they were almost overhauled by a charging @entity99 towards the end of last season ’s domestic campaign , there were times when @entity15 ’s team played with an authority and a momentum that has so far eluded them this time around			1
@entity134 was substituted during the game as the @entity94 side were outwitted by @entity15 @entity137 watches from the bench , with @entity139 and @entity140 also missing from the team @entity142 gets stuck in during a gutsy outing for the @entity96 champions however , @entity16 have a result behind them now which is perhaps as important as anything they have managed during @entity15 ’s time at the club			1
some may look back at @entity139 ’s late goals that brought @entity16 unlikely victory at home to 10 - man @entity154 last month and talk of greater significance			1
certainly the @entity159 cause would already have been lost without them			2
on wednesday night , however , @entity16 won as a team and they also won without four of their best players			1
so perhaps this means more			0
take international footballers such as @entity139 , @entity166 , @entity140 and @entity137 out of any starting line - up and the capacity to win big games will perhaps drop by as much as thirty per cent			1
that only serves to make this result even more impressive			0
@entity16 ’s issues this season have not centred around player injuries but more elusive factors of form and confidence , both individual and collective			2
some of @entity15 ’s best players have not been consistently at their best and that has damaged @entity16			2
on wednesday night it was a little different			2
@entity16 rode some good fortune at times - particularly early on - but who is to say they did n’t deserve it ? @entity184 was a menace early on with the @entity186 proving a thorn in @entity16 's defence @entity189 was stout in defence and promising in attack , with @entity192 thwarting this cross in @entity139 's absence , @entity194 led the line as @entity16 played a blinder in the @entity94 capital @entity27 needed to be more clinical - @entity199 the statistics released after the game showed @entity27 had more shots , made more passes and won more corners			1
but they also showed that @entity16 ’s players had run further			2
as such , this was an away win founded on old - fashioned principles			0
the size of the task facing @entity15 ’s team was huge			2
despite their 7 - 1 humbling here by @entity154 , @entity27 ’s home record this season is actually very good and if @entity16 were to take the win they needed they knew they would have to find something rather special			1
early on , they struggled a little			0
@entity27 left back @entity220 almost scored and @entity184 troubled @entity16 in a fashion alien to those who watched him labour as an @entity224 player			2
@entity16 did improve , though , and were reasonably robust in central areas while , in the attacking third , @entity189 and @entity226 looked dangerous on occasion			0
ultimately , @entity16 produced something that has eluded them for so long , namely a ‘ proper ’ @entity159 performance			1
they defended stoutly and broke to steal the lead with a stunning goal			1
after that , there were scares			0
there were always going to be			0
@entity78 made some saves that he will remember for a while just as @entity27 ’s forwards missed some chances they perhaps should n’t have			0
over in @entity243 , things went @entity16 ’s way , too , but we should n’t dwell on that			0
instead , we should dwell on what was a huge performance and a huge result for @entity15 and @entity16			1
this is what grown - up @entity159 teams do			2
it has been a while coming and it will be interesting to see if it proves to be a catalyst for change or something less meaningful .			0

@entity16 beat @entity27 2 - 0 on wednesday night at @entity256
now in his second season , @entity15 must show the team is making progress
will @entity28 's opening goal prove to be the catalyst in @entity159 which @entity16 are looking for ?
while not as good as last year 's team , they now have a significant result behind them
and all without @entity137 , @entity139 , @entity140
@entity16 produced something that has eluded them for so long : a proper @entity159 performance
they defended stoutly and broke to steal the game with a stunning goal
@entity38 added a second late on to cap a memorable victory
