by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:16 est , 22 december 2013 @entity2 : 05:34 est , 23 december 2013 @entity5 and @entity6 migrants coming to @entity7 in the @entity8 could put huge pressure on housing , schools and hospitals , a major report warns today			1
the study by the centre - left @entity14 says most of the new arrivals will settle in @entity17 and the @entity18 – meaning public services in these areas will be most affected			1
it warns that @entity7 could see an increase in anti-social behaviour , aggressive begging , rough sleeping and criminality from next week			1
under fire : the report from the @entity14 said that @entity30 's changes to benefit rules - designed to discourage migrants - are ' largely symbolic ' and it says @entity30 ’s much heralded changes to benefits rules are ‘ largely symbolic ’ and will make little or no difference			1
the report will ratchet up the pressure on ministers ahead of january 1 , when the remaining controls on working rights for nationals of the two countries will expire			1
mr @entity30 has resisted calls to face down the @entity45 and extend the controls , despite opinion polls showing huge public support for such a move			2
the report calls for ‘ urgent action ’ to deal with the wider housing crisis			1
it states : ‘ future migration to the @entity54 from @entity6 and @entity5 is likely to place added pressure on the lower - end of the private rented sector , particularly in the areas of @entity17 and the @entity18 where most @entity5 and @entity6 migrants currently live and where housing is already in high demand			1
’ the report warns schools – which are already facing huge pressure due to existing population growth – and hospitals will also bear the brunt of a surge in numbers			1
‘ in the short term , the need for extra school places and additional usage of @entity75 services in some areas are likely to be the main consequences , ’ it says			2
it concludes that crime could increase because @entity5 are ‘ disproportionately reflected ’ in the crime statistics			2
crime : the report says lawbreaking could increase as @entity5 are ' disproportionately reflected ' in crime statistics			1
pictured are two @entity5 travellers with a policeman in @entity17 's @entity88 they are second only to @entity89 in terms of foreign national arrests since 2008 – despite being far fewer in number			1
the report warns of potential problems with ‘ anti-social behaviour ( including aggressive begging ) , rough sleeping and even criminality ’			1
it is scathing about the changes to benefit rules , which were much heralded by @entity102			2
they will mean @entity45 migrants can not claim out - of - work benefits for three months after arriving			0
the political response , it says , has been ‘ more symbolic than substantive ’ – and it accuses ministers of ‘ rushing through last minute measures limiting access to entitlements ’			0
ministers should set up a dedicated fund of millions of pounds and use it to help communities where pressure on public services is particularly acute , the report says			2
it is published as mr @entity30 faces criticism from the president of @entity6 over efforts to restrict future @entity45 migration			0
@entity123 accused the @entity124 of trying to build an ‘ iron curtain ’ in @entity126 and pandering to nationalist sentiment			0
in an interview with the @entity130 newspaper , he called on @entity7 to stay true to its legacy as ‘ a great global power that pioneered integration ’			0
mr @entity123 added : ‘ @entity7 and damaging @entity7 ’s reputation is not the right history to write			0
’ a third of @entity141 sellers are from @entity126 , the magazine ’s founder has revealed			0
@entity142 , 67 , said of that group , more than half are originally from @entity146 communities			0
he said there had been a rise in the number of immigrant vendors in recent years as more migrants came from @entity126			0
many @entity146 turned to selling @entity141 to escape lives of ‘ feral poverty ’ he added			0
controversially , he also said their reasons for choosing @entity7 were ‘ made up maybe of [ claiming ] social security , maybe the ability to beg , maybe the ability to thieve ’			0
one in three of the babies born in @entity161 and @entity162 last year had at least one parent who was born overseas			2
in @entity17 , almost seven in ten babies had at least one @entity166 - born parent , and in parts of the capital it was nearly 90 per cent			1
the @entity170 figures show the stark changes in the number of migrants having children in this country over the past decade			0
since 2000 , the proportion of babies with foreign - born parents has increased by half			0
then , 21.2 babies had at least one , but by last year that figure stood at 31.4 per cent .			2

major report by the @entity14 gave a warning
said that @entity17 and the @entity18 will be particularly at risk
there could also be more aggressive begging , anti-social behaviour , rough sleeping and criminality from the new year , when restrictions are lifted
