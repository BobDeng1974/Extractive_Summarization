by @entity0 published : 10:47 est , 15 march 2013 updated : 04:38 est , 16 march 2013 its garish interior would surely make @entity3 scream ' lovely - jubbly '			0
but for visitors to this year 's @entity6 , the recreation of one of @entity10 's most famous living rooms will probably serve as a lesson in how not to decorate a home			1
the home of the @entity15 family from the comedy classic @entity16 has been lovingly replicated for the exhibition			2
architect and tv presenter @entity27 proved he was no plonker as he came up with the space - saving ideas			1
the tv replica flat has been furnished with only the finest of 1980s interior design ; from faux fur animal print rugs ( complete with the creature 's head ) , to the epitome of home - entertaining - a mini-bar			2
chairs surround a glass - topped table , which is nestled alongside the palm - tree printed wallpaper , which has sadly been concealed by a wall dresser			0
thankfully , the brown and yellow curtain still manage to catch the eye , along with the chintzy chairs and swirling patterned carpet			0
only fools would criticise the way the ceramic animal statue pairs with the traffic cone , which leads to @entity3 's bedroom that has a tiger skin throw			0
actor @entity69 - who played sneering car dealer @entity70 in the hit show - and a @entity74 lookalike sampled a few cocktails as they viewed the new and improved living room			0
@entity27 is an architect and tv presenter , who has appeared on @entity79 's @entity78			1
he 's also featured on the @entity80 and @entity27 ’s @entity81			1
due to @entity10 homes being amongst the smallest in @entity83 , mr @entity27 hopes the famous tv living room will draw attention to his scheme			2
his modernised council flat hopes to demonstrate how to ' rearrange , and reorganise the space to make it more efficient and functional '			1
@entity20 palace : the home has been given a makeover alongside another similarly - sized property that has been given a modern twist , showing what can be done with space actors @entity69 - who played @entity99 - and a @entity74 lookalike pose in a recreation of the set of ' @entity16 ' the @entity6 has showcased how to make the most of your living room - and used the beloved @entity15 home as a comparison the update uses the same structure and footprint of the @entity112 ' flat but the internal layout has been changed to ' reflect the demands of @entity116 living '			1
mr @entity27 said : ' when it comes to our homes , conventional wisdom dictates bigger is better			2
but with housing stock in short supply and the cost of space at such a premium , those wanting to get onto the property ladder are looking for smaller , more affordable alternatives to becoming homeowners			0
' but small spaces need n’t be full of clutter or chaotic			0
it ’s not about the space that you have , it ’s actually about how creative you are with it ; living big in small spaces			0
' double trouble : @entity136 and @entity74 as @entity15 and @entity137 ' @entity138 in a 1982 episode of @entity16 and horses nice wheels : @entity143 's @entity142 hangs above the @entity16 stand at the @entity6 bustling : an overview of the show at @entity146 today the iconic @entity10 @entity6 is at @entity146 , @entity36 for its 105th year , and suggests design ideas and home improvement tips			1
the wheeler - dealer duo , from @entity20 , south @entity36 , were well - known traders on the market , constantly trying to sell broken or useless goods to unsuspecting customers			0
they eventually became millionaires and bought upmarket apartments - before losing it all again and returning to their faithful flat			0
the show was actually filmed in @entity34 in @entity35 and later @entity161 – with his much younger brother , @entity15 ( @entity136 ) , and their elderly @entity164 , and later @entity165			1
the exhibition is full of authentic retro items , including a mug with the faces of @entity170 and @entity171 ( left ) and a framed picture of @entity165 , one of the show 's main characters some of the items from @entity3 's minbar , including a bottle of @entity178 and a halved pineapple , possibly holding a @entity180 in keeping with the programme , the room is full of the kind of junk @entity3 sold to make a living a faux fur rug in the only @entity16 living room the designer hoped to accurately recreate the 80s living room with a dated bottle of @entity192 's vinegar and party poppers in the background the living room features the ' latest in designer wear ' as sold by @entity112 ' independent traders the flat 's designers have gone to all lengths to make the room look realistic a leopard print ashtray complete with @entity3 's favourite cigar a retro @entity206 sound system has been included in the living room some bottles of @entity20 's finest @entity209 ' in front of some of @entity3 's calculator stock a similar room appears next door to the replica @entity15 flat which the designer has used to showcase how space can be used in a modern council flat even more junk can be found nestling in very corner of the flat @entity170 and @entity171 make a second appearance on a tin of travel sweets a mantlepiece displaying an eclectic range of bits and bobs another two royal references can be spotted as @entity170 and @entity171 make yet another appearance a porcelain pooch only the finest artwork on @entity3 's wall			1
