@entity9 graced some of opera ’s finest concert halls and had sung at leading sporting events			2
for several months she had been complained of shortness of breath and tiredness			2
@entity9 , 38 , died after doctors failed to spot a grapefruit sized tumour growing behind her heart in december 2012 she went to her gp who prescribed antibiotics and , when these failed to improve her condition , eventually referred her for a ct scan at @entity25 , in @entity26 , in february 2013			1
her condition worsened but the tumour , which measured 10cm by 7cm and was forming behind her heart , was not spotted on the ct scan			1
it was only picked up by doctors five days before she died on april 9 , 2013			1
ms @entity9 was admitted to the @entity31 when the tumour was discovered but nothing could be done to save her			2
her father , @entity34 , told @entity35 his daughter had been ill since august 2012			0
‘ the first time i was aware there was a problem was august 2012 when she referred herself to a chiropractor , ’ said mr @entity34			0
miss @entity9 , an opera singer , was initially given antibiotics but these failed to improve her symptoms so she was referred for a ct scan but doctors failed to spot the tumour on the scan ‘ she had a complaint of pain in her shoulder and a tight chest and a stooping posture			1
‘ in november 2012 we attended the @entity53 vs @entity55 rugby match and went home afterwards			0
‘ we were walking up a steep hill and she was lagging far behind me - i had never noticed that before			0
‘ there was another instance when i took her back to @entity63 - she was walking up the stairs to her flat and she began violently vomiting - i had never seen anything quite so bizarre			0
’ the inquest into her death heard that the tumour could have been spotted sooner but that there was no guarantee that this would have enabled doctors to save her life			2
dr @entity73 claimed doctors probably should have realised there was a tumour behind her heart long before it was eventually found just five days before ms @entity9 ’s death			1
but she said there was no evidence to suggest doctors would have found a way to save her life			0
tributes flooded in for @entity82 , of @entity63 , @entity83 , after her death			0

‘ she was a successful professional in her music and was a fit and healthy young woman with the rest of her life to look forward to			0
miss @entity9 would have been diagnosed sooner if doctors at @entity25 had spotted the tumour on her ct scan results but the coroner accepted that this might not have allowed them to save her life ‘ this was a highly unusual tumour and a very rapid deterioration in her condition			1
‘ she strikes me as the sort of person who did not wish to make a fuss to the point it was detrimental to her and she was a brave soul who did not want to trouble anyone			0
’ she added : ‘ doctors had difficulty in understanding the underlying condition and she had a lack of response to conventional treatment			0
december 2012 : miss @entity9 visits her gp suffering from tiredness and shortness of breath			1
the antibiotics failed to work so she was referred for a ct scan			1

april 4 , 2013 : miss @entity9 's tumour is finally detected			1
april 9 , 2013 : miss @entity9 dies at the @entity31			1
‘ gp enquiries as to who the best person to send her to ended up with her being sent to the hospital to review this unusual condition			0
‘ events took a turn for the worse - she was quite clearly unwell and doctors felt she required a ct scan but it was not entirely clear as to how quickly that should be done			2
‘ she was discharged and in the meantime became yet more unwell and again ended up in hospital this time in @entity167			0
‘ she was seen in @entity168 and the following morning was seen by a doctor who felt her condition could be dealt with by waiting for her planned ct scan that was coming up at @entity25 on march 21			1
‘ she became severely ill on 9 april and went to @entity25 where her symptoms had worsened - in view of her discomfort doctors thought it was a pulmonary embolism but the scan revealed a tumour			1
’ the coroner explained that abnormalities were visible on the ct scan , which took place on march 21 and that an independent expert believed the tumour should have been spotted at this point			1
however , the expert accepted that the tumour was hard to see because of its position			0
dr @entity107 concluded : ‘ this was a very complex situation but one could only think that an earlier diagnosis would give a possibility of a better outcome but it is not possible to say for sure in her case			0
