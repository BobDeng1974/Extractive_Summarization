but @entity5 hit back with three touchdowns in five minutes to make it a contest , before @entity18 completed his hat - trick and @entity24 got in on the scoring , with @entity26 getting a late consolation try for the visitors			1

@entity18 then returned the compliment to his centre with another neatly taken try three minutes later to leave the @entity44 reeling			2
but the visitors managed to enjoy a blistering five - minute spell after getting themselves on the scoresheet for the first time on 50 minutes when they moved the ball well to create space for @entity66 to power over on the left			0
spectacular : @entity0 ' @entity18 completes his hat trick against @entity5 virtually from the restart the @entity44 were in again with a long range movement that was polished off by @entity72 as he completed a quick - fire double			1
a long delay followed after scrum half @entity34 was carried off on a stretcher with his legs strapped together			1

@entity86 slotted the goal and the score was pegged back to 32 - 16			0
after that @entity14 managed to stem the flow and showed plenty of urgency when they countered , with @entity92 helping the forwards to march the ball downfield			2
and from a repeat set , after @entity96 's fingers had nudged @entity98 's high kick , @entity14 moved the ball well with @entity18 going in at the corner for his third			1
four minutes later the @entity5 backline was breached again , with @entity24 pouncing on an attempted clearance to go over the line			0
