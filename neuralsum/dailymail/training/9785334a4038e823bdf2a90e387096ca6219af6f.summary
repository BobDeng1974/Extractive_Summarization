‘ you have the prisoners who have all this knowledge in their head , but are not necessarily going to give it out in interrogation			0
@entity9 has three sites - he started in the @entity128			1
‘ then he moved out to @entity73 near @entity129			0
he then took over @entity21 , but the prisoners were only there for two or three days			1
the third place was @entity78 , near @entity79			0
’ she said that the prisoners would be bugged from ‘ when they woke up in the morning to when they went to sleep ’ , adding : ‘ the impact of this on the war is hugely significant and underrated			1
