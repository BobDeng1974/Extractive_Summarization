one day @entity1 will stop writing tennis history but , at 33 , there is absolutely no sign of it yet			1
his huge list of tennis achievements already reads like some kind of biblical scroll lengthwise , and on sunday he helped @entity9 to win the @entity11 title for the first time by defeating @entity13 3 - 1 before a world record crowd			1
of course it had to be @entity1 himself to strike the winning blow , finding himself charged with clinching the 114 year - old @entity11 when walking out to face @entity19 amid the feverish atmosphere of the @entity21			1
video : scroll down to watch highlights of @entity1 winning the @entity11 @entity1 drops to his knees after beating @entity19 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 2 in @entity25 to win the @entity11 @entity1 hugs @entity9 coach @entity26 after his superb display secured the team tournament title @entity1 looked overcome by emotion in the immediate aftermath , after this rare new new experience for him he duly did so with a minimum of fuss , dispatching the @entity13 – a late substitute for @entity36 – 6 - 4 6 - 2 6 - 2 to put the outcome beyond any doubt			1
to 17 @entity44 , 302 weeks as world number one , an @entity40 ( in doubles , but let us not split hairs ) , winning every different @entity45 and a multitude of other things add the sport 's premier team competition , claimed this year in the company of @entity51			0
it was only this time last week that the scale of the two players ' argument at the @entity56 in @entity57 was becoming apparent , after the calling out from courtside of his wife @entity59 during their saturday semi-final			0
seven days and one repaired back on from there he was in scintillating form , taking the pivotal doubles point on saturday and then finishing the job off in solo combat against the unfortunate @entity19			1
@entity1 and @entity26 are joined by @entity51 as the @entity68 struggles to contain his emotion @entity51 was the first onto the court to celebrate with his team - mate and their coach @entity51 and @entity1 put aside their high - profile row last week to come together and win the trophy the pair are all smiles , just a week after falling out in @entity57 , with their trophies in hand the @entity9 team celebrate on court after winning their country 's first ever @entity11 @entity86 ( left to right ) , @entity87 , @entity51 , @entity1 and @entity26 recieve their trophies @entity1 celebrates winning a point during his @entity11 final victory in @entity25 if anything was going to galvanise @entity1 it was his highly polished status taking something of a knock from the events of the previous weekend			1
he disappointed fans at the @entity97 when pulling out of the final and then got caught up in the fallout from his argument with his old friend / rival / team - mate			2
@entity59 was not there to witness this redemption , having stayed back at home in @entity9 to avoid any distraction			1
on friday he had looked somewhat immobile in being hit off the court by @entity107 , although by the end of that match he was moving better , a trend that continued in the doubles and inexorably on sunday			0
the @entity9 star , who had won everything in the sport bar the @entity11 before this , completed the trophy set the @entity117 2 was back to his imperious best after a difficult friday to swat away @entity19 ' not for me , this is for the boys			1
i have won enough in my career that i do n't need this to complete my everything – ticking off the boxes			0
we put in so much hard work			0
i am happy i was able to stay calm and play a good match , ' he said in the emotional aftermath			0
we may never know how bad his back really was , and it was certainly transformed from the final 's opening day , which increasingly looks like it was a practice session for the second two matches he was to play			2
@entity136 mischievously tweeted afterwards : ' amazing how long a couple of days is in sport … ' it seemed @entity51 thought the same			0
as the @entity9 celebrations got into full swing the @entity9 no 2 later joked ' @entity142 '			2
whatever , @entity1 clearly trusted his back completely against a player he knows he should beat , having amassed at 12 - 2 career record against the talented but introverted @entity19 , who is not known as the fiercest competitor			1
@entity36 ( right ) who was dropped for this match , and @entity107 , can only look on during the final @entity19 , a late replacement for @entity36 , was unable to prevent @entity1 's comfortable win it was not entirely clear why @entity19 was promoted over @entity36 to try and keep the final alive			1
conflicting accounts from the @entity13 team and their officials had him being plain dropped or nursing an injured elbow			0
but in truth , neither he nor @entity19 would have been expected to beat @entity1 in fully restored fitness and on this form , with the @entity9 having ended the season as the world number two by force of results rather than any accident			1
his mountain of big match experience was bound to serve him well in the bear pit atmosphere that greeted him , with his every shot in the warm - up greeted with a boo			0
@entity1 was stretched occasionally , but he had more than enough to see off @entity19 and secure the win @entity9 coach @entity26 celebrates as his no 1 produces a brilliant display to seal the trophy once it got going he always looked the winner , by virtue of him doing the same things as @entity19 does but a bit better , aided by the fact that he remains quicker around the court than the man five years his junior			1
he broke for 4 - 2 in the first set , and broke twice more to forge ahead to 5 - 2 in the second set			0
@entity185 umpire @entity184 had his work cut out controlling the excitable @entity13 captain @entity187 , who protested about several line calls , but @entity1 remained serene			2
another couple of breaks saw him serve out for the match and he finished it in glorious style with an exquisite drop shot , before falling onto the clay face forward and being hugged by his team - mates			0
@entity1 looked overcome by emotion at the end , after this rare new new experience for him			2
he is a remarkable athlete for our times			0
having drunk some champagne with his teammates @entity1 later said ' on monday or tuesday i thought there was no way i could play three days this weekend , it was after friday 's match i felt more confident			2
' he would not commit to whether or not he would help defend the title next year .			0

@entity1 beats @entity19 in *straight* sets to seal win
@entity1 *shakes* off back injury to clinch trophy for the first time
@entity9 win final 3 - 1 with a game left to play
