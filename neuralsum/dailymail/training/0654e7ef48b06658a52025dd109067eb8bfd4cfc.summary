by @entity0 more than 80 elephants were killed when ivory poachers poisoned their watering holes with cyanide			1

@entity20 : more than 80 elephants have been killed after ivory poachers in @entity17 poisoned their watering holes with cynanide , endangering one of the world 's biggest herds			1
( @entity28 image ) @entity17 is home to some of @entity31 ’s largest elephant herds , with half of its estimated 80,000 population thought to be in @entity16			1
the sprawling 5,657 - square mile park is one of the few places in @entity31 to have escaped the rapid decline in the continent ’s elephant population			0
police said the poachers mixed a cocktail of cyanide with salt and water and poured it on to about 35 salt licks – exposed deposits of minerals that animals use to get nutrients vital for their survival			2
the poachers also buried containers of their deadly mixture on the edge of watering holes , where elephants drink and bathe , to contaminate the water supply			2
when police arrived at the sites they found the mutilated bodies of elephants strewn around			0
however , some of the smaller elephants still had tusks in place – apparently because it had not been worth taking them			2
the poachers were said to have been paid £ 450 for every nine large tusks			2
the poisonings occurred in july when the national park ’s security forces , which protect herds from the ever - present threat from ivory poachers , were switched to covering the @entity17 general election and its aftermath			1
majestic : elephants taking a mud bath at @entity16 , home to 40,000 of the massive animals , where poachers struck as security forces were preoccupied with policing the recent contested election there had been fears of violent demonstrations amid allegation that president @entity90 ’s landslide victory was rigged			1

‘ we are declaring war on the poachers , ’ he said			0
‘ we are responding with all our might because our wildlife , including the elephants they are killing , are part of the natural resources and wealth that we want to benefit the people of @entity17			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity126 said hundreds of animals were now at risk as a result of the contamination mr @entity109 said he would push for stiff penalties for convicted poachers , who routinely get less than the nine - year jail term imposed for cattle rustling			0
a wide range of other animal carcasses were also found near the contaminated watering holes , including buffalo , lions , vultures , antelopes and jackals			0
and last night there were fears that more animals could die in coming weeks as anything that feasted on the elephants ’ toxic carcasses could have also become poisoned			0
a spokesman for the @entity126 said : ‘ when other animals and birds feed on the rotting elephant carcasses , they will also die from the poison			0
hundreds of animals are now at risk			0
’ @entity157 , which accounts for 40 per cent of the world ’s trade in elephant tusks , is said to be one of the main markets for the @entity17 ivory , where it has been regarded as a symbol of wealth and status for thousands of years .			2
