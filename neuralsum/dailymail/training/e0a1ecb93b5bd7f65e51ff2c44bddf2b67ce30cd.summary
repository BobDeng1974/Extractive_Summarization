a man has been ordered to pay his ex-girlfriend £ 28,500 in a landmark ruling for unmarried couples because he promised her ' the security a wife would have '			1
@entity6 , 55 , said he had never envisaged marrying @entity7 and had never promised her anything when they began their relationship in 2000			1
the court heard the businessman had paid for the £ 240,000 home they shared in @entity15 , @entity16 , and also covered the £ 100,000 mortgage , intending it should always stay in his name alone			1
@entity22 judges have ruled that unmarried man @entity6 should pay his ex-girlfriend £ 28,500 in a landmark ruling after she was left ' effectively homeless ' following their break - up but the court heard miss @entity27 and her two daughters were left stranded after the acrimonious break - down of their relationship in 2012			1
ruling on the case last year , judge @entity34 - @entity33 said that mr @entity6 was ' shrewd , cautious and guarded ' and had not wanted to marry miss @entity7 because he knew what she would be able to claim should they break up			1
now a judge has ruled mr @entity6 , a claims handler , should give miss @entity27 a £ 28,500 stake in the property to uphold his previous promise of security			1
dismissing the appeal lodged by mr @entity6 , @entity44 said that to go back on the assurances he gave her would be ' unconscionable '			2
insisting he should not pay her the money , mr @entity6 claimed he had no legal obligation to ms @entity7 after their relationship ended			1
but the judge ruled that he ' did reassure her that she would always have a home and be secure in this one '			0
lord justice @entity44 said mr @entity6 had told her that he was ' taking on a long - term commitment to provide her with a secure home '			2
he added that miss @entity27 had ' abandoned her secure home ' , in which she had invested what little money she had , to move in with mr @entity6			2
during the case , the court heard how miss @entity27 , a divorcee , had taken a ' big risk ' in giving up her job and home to move in with mr @entity6			1
the court heard he had ' reassured ' her she would be secure after the couple made a joint decision to buy the house in 2002			0
the court heard that @entity7 was left effectively homeless when their relationship broke down in 2012 ( file picture posed by models ) but mr @entity6 ' made sure she was kept away from any paperwork that might suggest she had an interest ' , the court was told			1
judge @entity76 had previously said : ' he led her to believe that she would have the sort of security that a wife would have , in terms of accommodation at the house and income			0
' and she relied on that '			0
judge @entity76 added it was unlikely mr @entity6 would have promised miss @entity27 an equal share in the house , knowing it would have been ' against his interest to do so '			1
he said : ' he did not envisage marriage because he was aware that , as a wife , miss @entity27 might have a substantial claim against him in the event of a breakdown			0
' he was prepared to provide a home to miss @entity27 and her two daughters , but it was to be on his terms			0
' both parties may have been ' in love ' , as they claim , believing that their relationship would never end , but i do not believe that either of them were blind to the realities '			0
the court heard that , with the benefit of hindsight , miss @entity27 realised that she had been ' too trusting and foolish ' in failing to secure her rights			0
but judge @entity76 said mr @entity6 made ' reassuring promises to persuade her to move '			2
he said added : ' he thought he was taking on a long - term commitment to provide her with a secure home and said so to her			0
' he made such reassuring promises as were necessary to persuade her to move , and thereby give up her own independence and security			0
' she was taking a big risk , moving from a secure rented house on which she had spent a lot of money , leaving her job and moving her children			0
' without trust in mr @entity6 and reassurances from him she would not have moved as she did ' .			2
