children 's minister @entity0 is this week set to explain details of a @entity2 to protect children against sexual exploitation the government has finally answered the call to protect vulnerable children in danger of sexual exploitation			1
it will , this week , publish a @entity2 designed to make the issue a ' top priority ' for every local authority			1
the news comes amid a devastating report into the failures of police and care agencies to protect teenage girls who have been groomed , raped and sold by male gangs , most of whom are @entity23			1
the mother of one teenager from @entity26 , who attempted suicide after a gang rape , said her daughter was the victim of a ' broken system			2
' ' everyone failed her , ' she told @entity34			2
' there was no sharing of information			2
' they ( police ) had the names and knew where they ( abusers ) worked yet the men who did this have never once been arrested or spoken to by the police			1
' @entity46 vowed to look again at the case to see if ' there is evidence that can help bring evil men to book '			2
growing worry : @entity54 footage shows now jailed gang members @entity55 and @entity55 meeting girls as they cruise the streets of @entity59 in a @entity60 jailed : @entity55 , left , and @entity55 , right , were leaders of the paedophile ring in @entity59 and committed a catalogue of offences against vulnerable young girls children 's charity @entity68 has been calling on the government to take action on child exploitation since january with its @entity73 campaign			1
other caregivers have also suggested that political sensitivities are to blame for a near paralysis of the systems designed to keep children safe			1
like most little girls , @entity79 lived for horses			1
she had an exemplary school record with 100 per cent attendance rate			2
but at 13 , the teen from @entity85 , @entity86 , was given a laptop and quickly became addicted to @entity88			2
her father was then warned his daughter was spending a lot of time with older @entity23 men			2
one even told the father he would ' slit his throat ' when he answered the phone to him			2
from there it got worse			2
@entity79 started disappearing overnight and began drinking			2
yet , when her father locked his daughter in her room to protect her , it was he who got into trouble with the police for false imprisonment			1
he told @entity34 he has since collected every scrap of evidence to prove his daughter is being sexually exploited by gangs			0
' the police kept saying that they 're waiting until @entity79 realises it 's wrong , ' he said			1
' is that really the best they can do ? when the father of 14 - year - old @entity114 looked at his daughter 's @entity88 profile , he discovered ' loads of male , @entity23 friends			0
' concerned , he started to restrict his daughter 's activities			0
the teen from @entity85 , @entity86 , then went to live with her mother			0
he tracked down all the names and addresses of her friends he believed were involved and passed them on to police			1
meanwhile her school was reporting @entity114 had begun arriving looking ' dirty and extremely thin '			0
she was going missing for days at a time , according to agency notes			0
by october last year she ' admitted she has slept with different @entity23 males			0
' the police told @entity114 's father they hoped to take action against the men			1
that was 17 months ago and he is still waiting			0
' there 's no will to deal with this issue in @entity85 ' he said			0
' what chance have these kids got if that 's the attitude of the police ? ' there is a culture ' which assumes that once a girl gets to 14 she 's beyond hope of intervention - it 's too late , ' a source told @entity34			1
police and care agencies often say that they can not take action against suspects without the victim 's co-operation			1
however , a 2008 protocol established by the force and @entity86 's five local authorities states : ' adults involved in child sexual exploitation ... should be treated as child sex abusers and subjected to the full rigour of the criminal law			1
' @entity165 is the only case in six who was groomed by a gang of white men			0
the abuse began when she was 12 after a visit to @entity26 from her family home in @entity174			0
@entity165 had thought they were ' really nice people ' but by 13 she was doing drugs - ' everything but heroin '			0
the first time she was ' drugged up to the eyeballs ' and remembers being dragged into a bedroom and gang raped			0
afterwards her mother took @entity165 to the police station , only to be told that ' we do n't deal with that here '			1
in desperation @entity165 's mother took her daughter to @entity189 and away from the gang			0
she let her return four months later			0
@entity165 did return to her old haunts but discovered it was n't really what she wanted			0
' i used to think it was so exciting , ' she told @entity34			0
' but after @entity189 , it was like seeing them with another pair of eyes			0
' she has n't been back since			0
children 's minister , @entity0 , suggested two weeks ago that the plan will call on councils to act with a ' much greater urgency ' to identify victims of sexual exploitation while taking ' robust action against those who commit these appalling crimes			1
' as well as the gang rape case of the girl in @entity26 , five new cases have been highlighted by the @entity34 ' investigation			1
no one has been prosecuted for sex exploitation in any of them			1
only one of the girls in the six cases had been in care			1
one was groomed by white students , but in all the other cases , the perpetrators were @entity23 , mostly of @entity225 origin			0
this pattern of abuse at the hands of male @entity23 gangs in the @entity86 area has been highlighted before , but never formally acknowledged			1
in january the @entity23 ringleaders of a gang in @entity59 , who brought a ‘ reign of terror ’ to a city ’s streets , targeting and grooming young girls for horrific sexual abuse , were jailed			2
@entity55 and @entity55 were told they would serve a minimum of 11 years and eight years respectively before they could be considered for release			0
a @entity244 spokesman refused to reveal the contents of the @entity2 but said : ' we are publishing an action plan this week and that will draw on work around the country to prevent sexual exploitation , identify those at risk and support victims			1
' it will address the challenge of securing prosecutions and the need for robust action against perpetrators			0
' child sexual exploitation is an appalling form of child abuse and we are determined to do everything possible to stamp it out			1
