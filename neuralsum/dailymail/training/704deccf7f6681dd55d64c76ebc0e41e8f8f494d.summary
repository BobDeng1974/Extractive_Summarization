by @entity0 the general consensus is that this year 's @entity2 was one of the best ever , with a clutch of talented young designers injecting extra energy and brio into the 101 - year - old event			1
purple , magenta and claret were the dominant colours , closely followed by blue , while softly swaying grasses and umbellifers were interspersed with perennials to gorgeous effect			1
if you 've been inspired to recreate some of that @entity2 magic in your own garden , here are some of the key plants from this year 's show			1
tall , graceful @entity23 ( see main picture ; available from www.woottens plants.com ) cropped up in many of the show gardens , most strikingly in the immaculate gold - medal - winning @entity29 - inspired garden by @entity31 and @entity32 , where the blue flowers contrasted beautifully with lime - green euphorbias and box hedging			1
@entity23 thrive in sun or shade , need no staking , and also come in luscious shades of purple , white or yellow			2
@entity23 thrive in sun or shade so are fairly low maintenance their garden also used @entity46 ' , which has one of the most intense blues of any summer - flowering plant			2
the flowers , rather similar to forget - me - nots , are held on upright stems and set off by coarse , rather hairy leaves			2
this perennial , which needs free - draining soil and is fairly short - lived , is available from www.hardys-plants.co.uk			2
the youngest ever winner of a show garden gold medal , 27 - year - old @entity60 , made a big impression with the @entity63 garden			1
he used plenty of the deep - crimson loosestrife , @entity66 ' , and with its silvery foliage and very small , pineapple - shaped flowers , this perennial is an absolute stunner			2
@entity71 is available from www.crocus.co.uk , or it can be grown from seed in spring			0
the @entity76 garden , which won @entity77 , featured graceful planting of foxgloves , verbascums and aconites interspersed with the buttery - yellow lupin , @entity83 ' ( available from www.claire austin - hardyplants.co.uk )			0
@entity85 – magenta ones this time – also popped up in the exuberant @entity88 show garden , confirming that this humble cottage garden favourite is now the height of fashion			0
@entity92 , or white laceflower , is a hardy annual with ferny flowers and flat umbels of pure white flowers throughout the summer			1
it 's a great plant to use in a romantic , airy design and it was used to great effect in the @entity102 garden , which won a silver - gilt medal			1
seeds are available from www.chilternseeds.co.uk			0
the graceful @entity107 communis subsp			0
@entity108 was used in several show gardens and on the @entity110 stand in the marquee , which won a gold medal			1
this gladiolus is a world away from the familiar florist 's gladiolus ; it 's a slender plant with sword - shaped leaves and reddish - purple , funnel - shaped flowers that bloom throughout summer			1
although several new roses were launched at @entity2 , one of the most striking varieties on show is actually a couple of years old			1
@entity126 ' , bred by @entity127 ( www.david austinroses.co.uk ) has buds that start off as red before opening to a rich salmon colour			0
the unusual colour made it a hit with designers , and it looks set to become a classic			0
