anywhere else , a property developer who buys a bundle of foreclosed houses , abandoned factories and disused churches for a mere $ 500 a piece would be hailed as a genius			1
and @entity11 's $ 3.2million purchase of 6,350 homes is being called foolhardy			1
to be sure , there are plenty of gems in the city 's ' blight bundle			0
' a 170,00 - square - foot factory that 's still in good shape , a three - story brick home built in 1915 that most recently sold for $ 185,000 , a lovely @entity21 that 's ready to move into and a five - bedroom that simply needs a new roof			0
but city officials tell the @entity25 that 2,000 of the properties are vacant lots			1
more than 3,000 will need to be torn down immediately			2
instead it was going to be transferred to the @entity34 and the home would have been individually dealt with this property contains nothing more than a charred ruin of what was once a house in once a nice neighborhood it is estimated that only 1,000 of the properties have salvageable homes			1
and many of those will require significant work to make move - in ready all of the properties in the ' blight bundle ' have been foreclosed , though some are in better shape than others it costs an average of $ 10,000 to demolish and clean up the wreckage of a house in @entity9 - leaving @entity11 on the hook for more than $ 30million the @entity58 show the ' blight bundle ' properties in red , spread across the city of @entity9			1
other foreclosed homes that are in better shape are in blue hundreds more need so much rehab work that it 's not worth the effort			0
and only 1,000 are salvageable houses			1
the @entity58 has attempted to document all of the foreclosed and blighted houses in the city - tens of thousands of properties			1
what 's more , the city never intended anyone to buy its ' blight bundle			0
' it offered the properties up for auction so that they could then be given to the @entity34 , which would take care of selling the worthwhile properties a few at a time and cleaning up the rest			2
the city put strenuous rules on the buys of the ' blight bundle ' requiring the buyer to either demolish and clean up all 6,350 properties within the next six months or offer a development plan			2
' now what we have to do is find out if indeed this group is serious about taking on such a task			2
and if they 're willing to do so , we 're willing to listen , ' @entity93 chief deputy treasurer @entity92 told the @entity95			0
@entity11 , a @entity9 real estate developer , is leading the group of investors who paid $ 3.2million for the foreclosed homes more than 2,000 of the properties are simply vacant lots			1
some 3,000 more must be demolished included in the bundle in the former @entity102 , which closed in 2010 also in the package is this 170,000 square foot factory that 's still in good shape some of the blighted homes are really blighted at all all of the houses in the packaged have been seized by the city for nonpayment of property taxes the costs involved with the purchase of the ' blight bundle ' are already slated to be many times the $ 3.2million price tag			1
it costs $ 10,000 to demolish a house in @entity9			0
mr @entity11 and his investors are likely to be required to demolish all 3,000 - at a cost of more than $ 30million			1
many of the homes have fire damage , have been vandalized or have squatters living in them			0
countless hundreds have been stripped of pipes and anything valuable			0
many are in various states of disrepair			0
' i think i was born to do it			0
the idea of redevelopment in my community would be a work of love , ' he told the @entity95			0
the developer , however , has far from a perfect track record			2
he led a group of developers who tried to return the @entity140 to glory			2
in 2009 , the group defaulted on an $ 8.7million loan			0
this brick house looks in mostly good conidtion fixer - upper ? @entity147 has entirely consumed this property and it remains to be seen whether it can be salvaged room with a view : this house will almost certainly have to be torn down some of the homes can be quickly resold to owners the overgrown hedges and boarded - up windows show this property has been a blight on the neighborhood for some time falling down : @entity9 is hoping to clear away as many of the blighted properties as quickly as possible			1

developer @entity11 is leading a group of investors who bought 6,350 blighted properties
more than 2,000 are vacant lots and more than 3,000 of the houses must be demolished
