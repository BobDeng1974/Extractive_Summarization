a brave 18 - year - old man has braved the jaws of a tiger shark to film video of it eating a beached whale off the coast of @entity7			1
@entity8 waded in knee deep into the ocean at @entity11 - on the state 's south coast - to shoot the footage			1
residents who had gathered in crowds at the beach told @entity19 's @entity18 at least four sharks were seen feeding on the whale			2
at one heart stopping moment , the teenager loses his footing - slipping on seaweed - while he is up - close and personal with the predator			2
' it took a bit of guts to get in there and have a crack at it , ' mr @entity8 told @entity18			1
' my girlfriend 's right into her footage , i thought i 'd get this for her and she 'll be happy			0
' but mr @entity8 was not the only one curious about the whale and the sharks			2
one resident had come down to the beach with his daughter to check out all the action			0
the man 's child barred him from taking a dip but it did not stop them from spectating along with tens of others			0
a local @entity11 resident and his daughter were some of the crowd that gathered to watch the sharks feeding ' the shark would come and chomp on the whale , swim away 20 minutes later roughly and come back and chomp on it again go digest it , come back			1
it was quite amazing , ' he said			0
shark experts closed off the beach until the sharks had dispersed			0
they said it was common for sharks to feed off a carcass as they were known as the ' garbage cleaners of the sea '			0
after first circling around , the sharks dive down to bite off pieces of the dead whale			1

@entity8 waded into the water at @entity11 on the @entity7 south coast
the 18 - year - old said he did it because he just *wanted* to ' have a crack at it '
in footage , the tiger shark can be seen circling the beached whale carcass
the shark then dives down to take a bite of the dead *mammal* on the rocks
