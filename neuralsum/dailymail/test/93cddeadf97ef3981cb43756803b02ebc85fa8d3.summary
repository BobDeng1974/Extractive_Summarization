bumping into @entity0 in @entity1 in @entity2 just over a year ago was not such a big surprise , since we both have houses in @entity6 where i now live most of the year			1
however , it was a scene that would have amused anyone who had known us both , or had read about us in gossip columns , in our heyday in the @entity12			1
there we were , two gentlemen in our 70s ; me , a former newspaper editor and @entity0 a well - known businessman , with more than our fair share of silver hair			1
we were both pushing a buggy with a tiny baby inside : me , my son @entity21 , now four , who was born when i was 73 ; @entity0 , his daughter @entity23 , who arrived when he was 72			1
our beautiful and much younger wives ( a 40 - year gap in his case , 25 in mine ) were there too and it was smiles and congratulations all round			1
@entity31 ( left ) had his son @entity21 ( back right ) when he was 73 and his daughter @entity33 ( held by @entity31 ) when he was 76 - years - old since then @entity34 , 52 , and i have had a second child , @entity33 , while it has just been announced that 74 - year - old @entity0 and @entity37 are expecting a sibling for their 20 - month - old daughter			1
i was 76 when @entity33 came along last may , making me , i believe , the oldest living @entity42 new father			1
so what advice could i give to other would - be septuagenarian fathers ? well , i know from experience that two children are more than twice the work of one			1
you have two minds and sensitivities to cope with , so to prevent jealousy equal attention is essential			1
for example , as she is only ten months old , @entity33 ’s cot is in our bedroom			1
much effort is required to stop @entity21 thinking he is being excluded when he sleeps on his own			1
then there ’s the feeding , the nappy changing , the crying in the night and the wearying lack of sleep			1
the sheer physical effort of coping with children at this age can be demanding			1
so much so that i have to take a brisk daily walk and use an exercise bike and some modest weights to revive my shrinking muscles			1
after all , toddlers can be heavy and buggies even heavier			1
then there is the manhandling of a mountain of luggage whenever we travel : suitcases , car seats , pushchairs , carry - cots and toys			1
travelling with children is not easy , anyway , as i once discovered when i was bringing @entity21 back to @entity6 on my own after a family trip to the @entity42			1
we were in the two seats nearest the window , with a rather formidable - looking lady , casually flicking through the pages of a style magazine , in the aisle seat			2
the plane had just taken off and was still climbing ( with the lavatory off - limits ) when i detected a terrible smell			2
@entity21 ’s nappy had overflowed on to the seat ( note to nappy manufacturers : make them higher at the back )			2
i worked away frantically with wet wipes and a plastic bag , worrying about the people sitting nearby			2
fortunately , the lady in the aisle seat appeared to be lacking any sense of sight , hearing or smell			2
@entity31 ( pictured with @entity21 ) says the physical effort of coping with young children at his age can be demanding but he takes daily walks and uses an exercise bike to keep fit @entity21 and i managed to edge our way to the loo without making eye contact with other passengers and thankfully things were soon put right			1
i know @entity121 has hundreds of planes ; even so , if any reader is flying with them , i would avoid seat @entity125 , just in case			2
besides the occasional blip , raising a child , no matter your age , is a huge pleasure			1
feeding a baby its bottle is one of the great joys of life for a father and one of the few things one ever does that is unquestionably useful			1
however , when you are in your 70s , levering yourself out of a deep armchair afterwards and transferring baby to cot without waking it is quite a physical achievement			2
i think it should be included as an @entity149 event for the over- 75s			2
now i am 77 and i can think of many moments i have shared with my young children which never fail to bring a smile to my face ; mainly because i never dreamt i would be experiencing such moments at this age			2
there was the afternoon i spent catching popcorn fired from a cannon in a @entity160 square while being jostled by screaming infants			2
one morning , i dodged moving traffic to rescue a balloon for my son before the car wheels crushed it — or me			2
during a lively fiesta i paraded one child dressed as an ant and another as a strawberry before bumping into my @entity160 bank manager , herself dressed as a plum			2
then there is the novelty of exchanging pleasantries in halting @entity160 at my son ’s school gates with yummy mummies who must be at least 50 years younger than me			1
@entity6 is thankfully a marvellous place for bringing up children , and not only because the @entity160 simply idolise them			2
@entity34 and i began going there for holidays shortly after we met in 1997 and eventually we decided to make a permanent move			2
we now live in a beautiful finca , or country estate , on the side of a hill with mountain views all around and the sea only a few miles away			0
there is a big garden with an orchard , in which @entity21 and i pick oranges off our trees and he takes them away in his little wheelbarrow and puts them though the juicer himself while standing on a kitchen stool			0
you could n’t do that in @entity205 , my birthplace			0
when @entity21 started at the @entity207 ( nursery school ) , i used to take him there in a pushchair , then go into the main square for a coffee with the empty chair			0
on one of these journeys , a friend who understood the @entity214 spoken there says she heard an old @entity6 woman say to her neighbour : ‘ the old man has forgotten the baby again			0
’ surprisingly , i have been mistaken for @entity21 ’s grandfather only twice ( at least to my face )			0
i have four grown - up children from earlier marriages			0
once , during a get - together in a restaurant , some pushy and very nosey @entity42 tourists at the next table insisted on knowing more about the puzzling family beside them			0
i declared proudly : ‘ this is my son @entity231 — he is 44 ; this is my son @entity21 — he is two			0
’ in fact , the gap between my oldest and youngest daughters is even bigger : 49 years			1
thankfully , the older children are very happy about the new arrivals and could n’t wait to see them			0
the eldest of my six grandchildren , who is 14 , sent his new - born @entity241 a note : ‘ hope the birth went well			0
’ my youngest grandchild is one - month - old			0
the biggest drawback with a baby at this age is the freedom it steals			0
the new arrival needs constant attention			0
whereas before i could write if i felt like it , or go for a walk , or read a book , or watch some sport on tv , there is now a prior , and sometimes rather insistent , call on my time			1
even though you have been through it before , there are always anxieties with tiny babies			0
before @entity33 was born , we were warned she might not survive due to a medical condition suffered by my wife			0
when @entity33 arrived fit and healthy via a @entity266 , the doctors had to give @entity34 emergency pain relief for several hours , during which time i was left holding the baby			1
talking to her during those first hours was a strangely surreal , precious experience			0
before leaving the hospital in @entity2 we had to complete some forms but the officials flatly refused to believe my date of birth and would n’t let us go until i had dug out my passport to prove it			0
thankfully , @entity34 and @entity33 both emerged none the worse for their respective ordeals			0
there had always been a nagging doubt in our minds that , given our ages , there was a risk of abnormality , but both our babies are strong and beautiful			0
along with the inevitable anxieties there are many small pleasures of late - life parenthood : the warming smile of recognition in the morning , that look of unconditional love , the noisy ecstasies of splash - time in the bath , the heart - bursting pride as baby takes its first steps			1
i look at @entity21 ’s face sometimes , his stubborn assertion of his identity , and feel a surge of love that comes from somewhere very deep inside			0
there is a sadder side to having tiny children at my age , in that i wo n’t live to see them as adults , maybe not even in their teens			0
i also have to face the fact that they may hardly remember me at all in later life			0
for them , too , there is the inevitable trauma of losing a parent while they are young			1
but then some children lose their parents anyway ; i have known two fathers who died at 51 , one of them before seeing his child			0
to say that i should not have had children at my age would have left my wife childless , for she has not been married before nor had any previous children			0
that is a big call for anyone to make about other people ’s lives			0
a curious family oddity is that my father was born in 1911 and @entity21 in 2011 ; my mother was born in 1914 and @entity33 in 2014			1
we called her @entity33 before realising how appropriate a name it was for someone born on the centenary of @entity343 i have to admit that it can be a strange and unsettling experience being so old a new father , especially when both children look like me ( friends call @entity21 ‘ a little @entity31 ’ )			1
you ca n’t help thinking : ‘ in my end is my beginning			0
’ whatever happens , one can only hope that these late - coming @entity351 will get as much fun out of life as their old man .			0

what *'s* it like to become a new parent in your seventies ?
@entity31 became a father for the sixth time aged 76
he shares the pain and pleasure of raising two toddlers in the *twilight* years
