it 's not exactly a competition for the faint - hearted , but let 's hope there was no sting in the tale for any of these brave bee beard growers			2
the remarkably daring men and women have got @entity10 all abuzz after taking part in the tenth annual @entity12			0
the contest sees four teams of competitors entice swarms of bees to the head and torso of a ' beard grower ' before two winners are chosen by the audience and the official judges			1
@entity41 is thought to date back to the 1700s when an @entity44 beekeeper discovered he could create a beard of bees by tying the queen to a thread around his neck and would parade through the streets wearing the unusual costume			0
at the @entity56 competition however , once in place , the beards are weighed before each wearer goes on to strut their stuff and perform a little dance in front of the watching crowds			2
the @entity62 is then chosen by judges , while the audience is also able to pick their @entity65			1
to bee the best , you 've got to beat the best : @entity27 ( left ) gets his bee beard groomed by @entity68 during the annual competition @entity70 of @entity71 shows off her bee beard for the competition			0
each team consists not only of the beard model , but also a ' bee whisperer ' , who is able to groom the insects into the required shape once in place , the beards of the competitors at @entity56 are weighed before each wearer goes on to strut their stuff and perform a little dance in front of the watching crowds @entity34 co-owner @entity86 told the @entity88 blog of the @entity89 : ' @entity62 beards are wonderful , but they ’re really tickly			1
' it takes well over a thousand stings in one shot to kill a person , so if you get a sting or two it ’s no big deal			0
' the competition at @entity56 sees $ 2,500 donated to the champion 's charity of choice , while $ 2,000 is given to the @entity65 's charity and $ 500 is offered to charities chosen by the remaining two competitors .			1
