by @entity0 the biggest collection of @entity2 posrcards by prolific artist @entity3 is going on display for the first time - on monday , the anniversary of the start of the conflict			1
the artist is famous for his comic seaside postcards , but he also helped the war effort by producing an incredible 1,500 different designs of patriotic postcards			1
@entity3 , known as the @entity13 , portrayed @entity15 soldiers in a bad light early on in his career , with cards showing them drunk , stealing and seducing women			1
this @entity21 postcard features a wounded @entity22 showing compassion to the @entity24 despite being at war but after war broke out he showed full support for the soldiers and thousands of his cards were sold in @entity30 and @entity31 , with many even translated into @entity31			2
‘ @entity3 lost his foot in a rugby accident so he could n't partake in the fighting , but he did a big effort for the war by producing thousands of patriotic cards , ’ said @entity33 , the owner of the @entity34 in @entity35 , @entity36			1
‘ most people have heard of him for his seaside postcards but , in fact , he has done much more than that			0
the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) was a @entity50 defensive position of the @entity2 , built during the winter of 1916 - 1917 on the @entity52 , from @entity53 to @entity54 , near @entity55 on the @entity56 ‘ as soon as the war began he started drawing cards and he produced 1,500 different designs , which is phenomenal and shows just how much they were in demand			1
‘ many of the cards featured sentimental poems and would have been sent from soldiers to their loved ones			1
the cards show @entity3 is not just sauce and seaside , he did his own bit for the war			1
’ postcard publishers and artists took the opportunity to increase sales during the @entity2 by commenting on both military and civilian events as they unfolded			0
ooh saucy : a @entity3 postcard often had a double meaning beach boy : @entity3 could even get away with penis jokes two old men ogling a young lady but that 's all they 're doing			2
age is against them ... @entity3 ’s cards show the men serving at the front as well as the realities facing their families at home			1
his designs cover issues such as rationing , home service , war profiteers , recruitment and soldiers in training			0
one postcard shows a soldier at an army camp carrying buckets of food , with the caption : ‘ what did you do in the @entity2			0
’ a policeman gives information to a volunteer on the look out for the enemy			0
note the wanted for murder poster of @entity115 on the wall by the policeman entente cordiale : a @entity22 snuggles up to his @entity31 belle self - portrait the artist as an old man : @entity3 as seen by himself saucy seaside fun was the hallmark of @entity3 's humour like this image of a young swain teaching his belle to swim another card features two young children huddled under an umbrella with the slogan : ‘ we ’re prepared for @entity135 raids			1
’ a soldier is seen cuddling a @entity31 woman in another card , which has the words : ‘ @entity30 and @entity31 will always " pull together "			0
’ whilst a sailor is seen kissing a @entity142 soldier in a kilt in another of @entity3 ’s humorous cards , which has the slogan : ‘ i ’ve sworn to kiss the first thing i meet in skirts when i come ashore			1
’ a soldier looks exhausted in another card which shows how busy army recruits are kept and is accompanied by the words ‘ - and then we have the rest of the day to ourselves			0
’ @entity3 's humourous take on the @entity22 's day with a little patriotism thrown in no nudity but @entity3 did n't always need to flash the flesh to make his point @entity158 : even though the @entity160 did n't enter the war until 1917 according to @entity3 the @entity159 wanted the @entity50 to lose @entity3 went to art school in @entity163 and began his professional career as a naval architect , then as an engineering draughtsman			2
but in 1904 at the age of 30 his postcard career kicked off by accident when he sent a cartoon to a nephew in hospital of a man up to his neck in a frozen pond			0
the caption read ‘ hope you get out ! ’ and was forwarded to a publisher who commissioned his work			0
two war scenes from the pen of @entity3 , both portraying @entity50 on the defeated side @entity3 quickly became an expert in the art of the postcard double entendre and his designs were ingenious , twisted and often downright rude			2
he produced a massive 12,000 different seaside postcards throughout his career but in 1954 he was charged with publishing obscene images and four of his cards were banned immediately and 17 more banned once existing stocks had been sold			1
he died in 1962 at the age of @entity196 career spanned seven decades , with his cards charting the changing times			0
two adorable small children show that they may be young but they are prepared fro @entity115 's onslaught this jolly jack tar returns home to his sweetheart with tales of @entity50 seafaring cowardice in honour of @entity206 : @entity206 was a warrior - class armoured cruiser built for the @entity209			0
she served with the 2nd @entity211 for most of the @entity2			0
the ship did not participate in the @entity213 in 1916 , but did sink the @entity50 raider leopard in 1917 @entity3 's postcards inspired those on the home front by showing the derring do of military men at home and abroad even @entity115 has someone to love him - even if it is the devil in this cartoon by @entity3 not so friendly - in this cartoon @entity115 is compared to an irritating fly by @entity3 at the height of his fame @entity3 only earned three guineas a design , but today his postcards are highly sought after with his original artwork going for up to £ 1,700 in auction and up to £ 2,500 in @entity233 .			2
