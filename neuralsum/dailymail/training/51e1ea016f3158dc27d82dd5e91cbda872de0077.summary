by @entity0 published : 17:08 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 04:42 est , 25 january 2014 a little girl in a white silk dress poses shyly with a basket of flowers , in a garden bordered by a neat privet hedge			1
the roofs of terraced houses can be seen beyond			1
she is about to attend a church parade			1
a small boy , of perhaps the same age , stands to attention in a double - breasted coat and school cap outside the bay window of his redbrick home			1
his shoes and shirt are immaculate and only an errant right sock , which has begun to wrinkle and slide down his leg , suggests anything less than a dedication to military smartness - by his parents , at least			1
both photographs were taken in the same street , in the same period of immediate post-war @entity31			1
both evoke an urban working - class pride in family , home and hard work , as well as a sense of community and making the best of a tough situation			1
in that respect the photographs are wholly unremarkable			1
thousands like them must exist			1
and yet they are not mundane			2
in their modest good order they are both shocking and sad , because the street in which they were taken is today the most notorious in @entity31 ; made so by a television programme which has shown the current residents ’ lifestyles , squalor , habitual criminality and an overall social disintegration			1
@entity71 in @entity73 , @entity74 , is infamous after being featured in @entity75 ’s highly controversial series @entity71			1
today the majority of residents in the @entity79 terrace houses claim benefits			1
the road is filthy , with rubbish strewn across the street and dirty mattresses abandoned on the pavements			2
many of those featured are criminals , drunks or class - a drug addicts			1
@entity90 rob each other and children fend for themselves while their parents smoke and drink outside			2
@entity47 , aged 6 , pictured middle , with her family all dressed up for the church procession but it was not always this way			2
this week , we spoke to members of families who lived in the ‘ golden age ’ of ‘ @entity71 ’ in the @entity104 through to the @entity105			1
they have long since moved away and now say they are saddened by how far their former home has fallen and the ‘ scrounging vermin ’ who live there now			2
@entity44 was the small chap in the cap and wrinkled sock			2
his family lived two doors away from the house now inhabited by the mother known as @entity119			2
his great - grandparents , grandparents and his mother @entity123 all lived on the road , the family having settled there at the start of the 20th century			1
mr @entity44 , 65 , said the family all worked in manual jobs , some from as young as ten years old , and moved to the area from @entity131 because @entity74 was renowned as the ‘ city of 1,000 trades ’			1
the women would work in cafes or wash neighbours ’ clothes for change , he recalled			1
‘ everybody was working , ’ he said			2
‘ people had to because there was no welfare			2
there ’s a lot of people on benefits today			1
my parents and grandparents would n’t believe it			2
when they were alive , if you did n’t work you did n’t get anything			1
’ the retired engraver , who now lives in @entity154 , @entity155 , with his wife said he was dismayed at the state of the street and how moral standards have disappeared			2
‘ nobody ever swore like that when we were there			2
if you were caught swearing in the street and a passer - by heard you , he ’d give you a clip round the ear			1
that ’s how it was			2
‘ the way they now swear at the young kids is dreadful			2
‘ i ca n’t remember as a kid any robberies or thefts			0
i never knew anyone who was a drunk			0
there was n’t anyone taking drugs			0
there was never rubbish on the road like there is now			0
‘ you kept your doors open			0
it used to be a nice road , with privet bushes outside every house			0
people had pride in their appearance			0
‘ it was a community — a village within a city , really			1
changes : the street is now featured in @entity75 documentary benefits street ‘ a lot of people i know ca n’t bring themselves to watch the programme			1
we ’re shocked at what has happened to the street			0
’ @entity47 was six when her photograph was taken as she wore the parachute silk dress , made by her mother			0
in the @entity104 she lived with her parents and two brothers a few houses away from where @entity119 now lives			0
‘ our house was a small grocer ’s shop , ’ she said			0
‘ i was only five or six at the time but i remember it so well , cigarettes kept under the counter for regulars , sacks of liquorice root , the fish and chip shop around the corner where you could get free scratchings			0
’ @entity224 , 56 , lived on the street in the @entity226 and @entity105 before leaving to join the forces			0
he is now a bricklayer and lives in @entity228 with his wife , with whom he has three adult children			0
he said : ‘ it infuriates me that these people are wallowing in their mire			0
they enjoy the lifestyle they are leading			0
it just dismays me to see what sort of vermin have colonised the area			1
they have turned it into a cesspit			0
‘ it is such a shame because of all the happy memories i had growing up there			0
i am ashamed to tell anyone i spent my childhood there because people will think i am as bad as the people in the programme			0
but my parents and their neighbours were a world apart			0
two residents sit drinking beer on their doorstep while talking to a child on a bicycle piles of rubbish are often seen scattered all over the street - which was very different in the post-war era ‘ my parents would be disgusted if they saw what it was like now			1
’ mr @entity224 was brought up with his three siblings on @entity71 by his father @entity268 , a lathe turner , and mother @entity270 , who worked in a factory			1
he said all the residents worked , even most mothers , and they took pride in their children ’s discipline and appearance			1
‘ my dad worked all the time			0
my mum was also at work			1
they could n’t afford not to			0
‘ you never swore in front of your parents because you knew what you were going to get if you answered back			0
now the children are effing and blinding , and that ’s even the toddlers			0
‘ i ca n’t believe how bad it has got			0
there is this greed — people want something for nothing			0
’ the road is believed to be named after @entity296 , a 19th - century master at the local @entity297 , who never missed a day of work			1
‘ he went out , worked hard and earned that honour , ’ says mr @entity224			0
‘ now his name is associated with everything he was not			0
