that ’s how the @entity3 kicker might introduce himself to a beautiful blonde or buxom brunette at a roulette table			1
although the 32 - year - old probably would n’t win any @entity8 lookalike contests on his own , @entity0 might have a shot if he pulled up in his ride			1
the @entity11 he drives is similar to the one 007 drove in @entity13			1
in addition to driving like @entity8 , @entity0 is also cool under pressure			1
@entity0 ( right ) met @entity17 's @entity16 at a training session on monday @entity0 ( no 10 ) is congratulated by center @entity19 ( 66 ) after kicking a field goal against @entity21 the @entity3 all - time leading scorer with 984 points , @entity0 has kicked seven - game winning field goals during his career - including a 59 - yard blast to defeat the @entity28 in 2010			1
as anyone who watched the last @entity32 game in @entity33 between the @entity34 and @entity35 can attest , the difference between winning and losing can all come down to one kick , a reality that @entity0 is certainly aware , but not afraid , of			1
the 11 - year pro played at @entity39 last season during @entity3 ’s 42 - 10 loss to the @entity42 and he ’s more than ready for the international stage once again			1
he said : ‘ it looks a little slippery but that ’s how it was last year			2
we know what to expect			2
the @entity49 have n’t played here yet			2
they ’ll find out it ’s something different that they ’ll have to adjust to			0
’ ‘ the footing is going to be different and the elements are different but at the same it ’s just snap , hold and kick			2
we ’re doing the same thing , just in a different place			0
’ ‘ you have to be focused and take each kick individually			1
go into it with the same mindset and confidence level whether you ’ve missed the last one or made the last one			0
’ like @entity8 , @entity0 is the proud owner of an @entity62 @entity0 is one of the @entity32 's most consistent kickers @entity0 has every reason to be confident			1
he ’s made 225 of 279 field goals in his career ( 80.64 percent ) and hit on 23 of 25 attempts ( 92 per cent ) last season			2
that sort of reliability has made him somewhat of an anchor , albeit an unlikely one , for @entity3 ’s young special teams unit			1
however , instead of calling himself a leader , @entity0 simply refers to himself as the ‘ oldest ’			1
he said : ‘ unfortunately the kicker is n’t always looked at that way			0
i try to be that person and be responsible for special teams			0
’ his role as an elder statesman has also made him responsible for advising the younger players about what to do in @entity33 , or more specifically , what not to do : ‘ do n’t go in strange places around the city where people might not like @entity87			0
’ despite that advice , @entity0 has n’t had any issues			1
‘ i ’ve been in the city walking around and enjoying the random things in @entity33			0
we do n’t have a lot of this stuff in @entity3 – all the old traditions			1
’ ‘ meeting people is a lot of fun			0
the different ways that people talk and the slang they use			0
you find yourself using a @entity104 accent after a little while , or at least trying to			0
it ’s a lot of fun			0
’ @entity0 has also had time for sightseeing			1
given his secret agent sensibilities , the destinations have been somewhat predictable			0
‘ i went to an @entity11 dealership			2
then i went to the @entity112 and saw all of the @entity8 cars			2
my favourite was the @entity117 from @entity118			0
i have a picture of it on my phone somewhere			0
’ it ’s unclear whether the phone he was referring to was supplied by @entity125			0

@entity0 has played in the @entity32 for 11 years and kicked at @entity39 last season
32 - year - old is a @entity8 *fan* and even drives an @entity11
@entity0 is @entity3 's all - time leading scorer by more than 200 points
says *key* to *success* is being ' focused ' and treating each kick ' individually '
