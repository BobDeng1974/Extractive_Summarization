by @entity0 published : 06:00 est , 1 april 2013 updated : 07:06 est , 1 april 2013 this morning we revealed the sensational news that an animal sanctuary had trained owls to deliver the mail in a development worthy of @entity7			1
the innovation could revolutionise how our postal system works - but do n't get too excited , because now that midday has passed it 's time to come clean and admit that it was in fact an @entity14 's joke			2
while the pictures may have looked convincing , the clue was in the name of the reporter - ' @entity19 ' is , sadly , not a real person			2
prank : the @entity22 reported that owls had been trained to deliver the post just like in @entity7 in full flight : but unfortunately these amazing pictures were mocked up - there 's no @entity22 yet ! but the @entity22 was not the only newspaper to pull the wool over its readers ' eyes - many of our rivals also played along with the spirit of the day			1
the @entity35 roped in its editor @entity36 to announce the launch of ' @entity38 ' , a parody of @entity40 glasses which apparently allows its users ' to see the world through the @entity35 's eyes at all times '			1
the jokey story pokes fun at the left - wing newspaper 's reputation for earnest commentary , saying the device is useful ' because life 's too short to think for yourself '			1
the @entity53 revealed that austerity had even hit the @entity55 , with @entity56 renting out its @entity58 suite to wealthy tourists for £ 10,000 a night at @entity60			0
guests will supposedly be allowed to join the @entity62 at breakfast ' for an all - you - can - eat buffet selection ' - but they will be strictly forbidden from accessing the @entity56 's wine collection			2
a wizard idea : but perhaps the hoax was too close to @entity70 's hit @entity7 series revolutionary : but it might take some time for owls to displace traditional methods of postage the @entity77 took a political tack , claiming that theatre impresario sir @entity79 was about to launch the coalition : the musical , by @entity82 composer @entity81			1
the composer supposedly told the paper : ' it focuses very much on the relationship between @entity86 and @entity87 and it has a big , operatic feel to it – i mean , it 's a sort of love story that 's gone wrong			2
' and the @entity93 made a literary joke with its @entity14 's gag as it announced the discovery of a cache of papers belonging to captain @entity99 , who supposedly fought in all of the @entity103 's major battles			0
the paper linked the adventurer to @entity106 , the fictional hero of @entity108 's popular series of novels			0
parody : the @entity35 poked fun at its own earnest reputation with ' @entity38 ' , inspired by @entity40 the @entity114 's prank story will send a chill down the spine of nervous flyers , as it announced the launch of a glass - bottomed plane allowing @entity121 passengers to watch the world go by during their flight			1
the paper reported that planes would be diverted over @entity126 to survey the spectacular scenery - and provided a clue to the story 's purpose by saying that ' more glass floor jets will be introduced from april 1 , 2014 '			1
on its website , the @entity114 indulged in a second joke by allowing users to apply ' @entity136 - style filters ' which change the look of the homepage			0
the filters included a vintage @entity140 look , a mirror image of the mirror page , and a ' drunk ' view to replicate the experience of trying to read the paper after a night out			0
filter : the @entity114 introduced @entity136 - style viewing options to its online homepage showbiz : the @entity150 roped in @entity151 to help it trick its readers this @entity153 for its own @entity14 's jokes , the @entity150 turned to the world of showbiz and roped in model @entity151 to play a prank on readers			1
the tan addict announced that her brown skin was thanks to ' @entity163 ' , a new skin product from @entity165 , better known for its diy wood stains			0
another @entity150 story reported that the @entity168 had gone on a camping holiday ( at the ' @entity171 ' campsite ) in order to prepare for the rigours of headlining @entity174 this summer			1
online news site @entity175 flexed its @entity178 muscles to post a picture of ' the @entity180 ' , a helter - skelter slide newly built around the @entity182 in @entity183			2
and venerable leftist magazine the @entity184 joked that it would adopt the hated @entity186 font to celebrate its 100th anniversary , describing the typeface as ' jaunty , fun and frolicsome '			0
sniffing it out : @entity191 , where users can search the ' @entity193 ' for smells and then inhale through their computer and phone screens , was launched on april 1 @entity40 is always an enthusiastic participant in @entity153 , and this year posted a number of pranks including @entity191 , supposedly a scent - based search engine			0
@entity200 , the video site owned by @entity40 , announced that it was shutting down after the conclusion of its eight - year quest to find ' the best video in the world '			1
and users of @entity208 were today allowed to apply a ' treasure ' filter to their browsing , rendering the world in an antique style			0
