on @entity0 by @entity1 from our @entity10 home , along the old @entity13 - @entity12 ( now the @entity14 )			1
each time we passed @entity0 , i would gaze up in fascination at the extraordinary , large tump at the side of the road , while my father hazarded guesses as to who built it and for what purpose			2
he liked to read about ancient history , and had a good line in ghostly speculation , too			0
was it once an island , part of a sacred complex , or a resting place for the long - dead ? what would it be like to climb it , at night , in a howling wind ? the dark secret of the purpose of pre-historic @entity0 , in @entity10 , still remains unknown we know that @entity0 is the largest prehistoric man - made mound in @entity40 — covering an area the size of three football pitches and probably built over a period of 100 years			1
but deeper certainty has always eluded those who have dug , tunnelled , photographed and studied it , from generations of archaeologists to writers such as @entity1			1
the enigma of this hill has inspired artists and poets , simply because people like mysteries			0
and what could be more mysterious than an upside - down pudding basin of earth and grass , a layer - cake of history plonked ( by the devil , they used to say ) at the side of an ancient route by the @entity66 ? in his prize - winning book @entity67 , poet , novelist , playwright , and teacher ( and not to mention one - time actor and puppeteer ) @entity1 gave us a brilliant overview of rural history			1
now , he offers an equally creative , personal panorama of the hill he fell in love with as a boy			1
at nearby @entity81 , he suffered the rules , torments and privations long - associated with @entity86 boarding schools , but escaped whenever possible into the surrounding downlands to climb strange @entity0 and set his imagination free			0
that sense of wonder remains : ‘ she was constructed without earth - movers or diggers , without power tools , without iron tools , without rulers and surveying instruments and hard hats , with only antler picks and ox shoulder blades and wickerwork baskets , plus human muscle			0
the hill is equivalent in size to a 13 - storey building and yet was created without the aid of modern day tools ‘ at around 130 feet high , she is equivalent to a 13 - storey building			1
if the @entity111 sailed just behind her in your dreams , you would only see the smoke from the funnels			0
’ @entity1 ’s narrative is as meandering as a walk up a tor , looping around and along tracks created by fox and badger , retracing steps , stopping to gaze at the surrounding landscape , and always entertained by reminiscences , happy and sad alike			2
in that sense , on @entity0 is another example of what might be called the new nature writing : unashamedly idiosyncratic and deeply personal , yet as well - researched as any historian would wish			0
@entity1 ’s memories take us from @entity133 bullies to episodes in @entity135 and @entity136 , as well as stories from his days as a travelling player and neo-hippy			2
but , always , @entity0 is the lodestone that draws him back , and he wanders afresh around the surrounding countryside , taking in the dark secrets of @entity142 , and speculating on both those ancient stones and the ones at @entity145 — feeling ill at ease ( it seems ) in this modern world			0
@entity0 is located near to the ancient route of the @entity66 , which has long since dried up ( left ) and the mound has always intrigued author @entity1 ( right ) in a fascinating series of interwoven strands , this book blends history , myth , archaeology , topography and poetry , and always leads us back to the haunting beauty of the question : ‘ why ? ’ @entity0 will keep its secrets — but , on the subject of beauty and history , i must add that , in this era of digital downloads , it ’s a real delight ( and relief ) to hold in my hand a small volume as perfect as this one , a work to treasure , part of the series of @entity176 , published in @entity177 , and worthy of its subject			1

author @entity1 fell in love with the hill as a schoolboy
