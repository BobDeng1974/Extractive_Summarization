@entity0 was in @entity3 ’s @entity2 squad that reached the semi-finals			1
wolves ’ striker @entity5 was in the @entity3 squad that only missed out on a @entity9 final in 1990 after another penalty shootout failure			1
i applaud them , and i certainly do n’t mean any disrespect , but if you ’re honest you ’ll agree it ’s hard to believe what @entity0 and @entity16 achieved			0
@entity3 are looking strong and should have a good chance at the @entity19 next year @entity20 has an exciting squad at his disposal and @entity3 should go deep into the tournament @entity3 players head out of the @entity26 tunnel for the second half of their @entity29 qualifier with @entity30 what it shows is that you do n’t have to have 23 truly top class players in your squad to make an impact at a tournament			1
so what ’s stopping @entity3 next summer ? history – that is all			2
and the right partner for @entity41			2
if one of @entity44 , @entity45 or @entity46 – or maybe a centre half who might burst on to the scene next season – can show the quality and consistency needed to make himself a regular in the @entity3 team then that ’s @entity20 ’s last problem solved			1
all other departments are looking healthy , fitness notwithstanding			0
goalkeeper @entity57 is looking the best he ’s ever looked			0
finding a partner for @entity41 in central defence is @entity20 's main concern ahead of the tournament @entity45 played alongside @entity41 against @entity30 but the place is far from nailed down goalkeeper @entity57 has performed consistently well for club @entity63 and country we have athletic young full backs who thrive in the modern game at club level ; @entity41 is still trusted by @entity70 , and has another year of learning off @entity71 to come in midfield it ’s now a shock if @entity75 does n't start for club and country ; @entity78 is looking a class act after an injury - hit difficult start at @entity81			1
@entity82 is at last being trusted by an @entity3 manager and if @entity20 keeps ignoring those who say he is n't quick enough ( his reading of the game more than makes up for that ) or does n't score enough goals ( the goal counters playing @entity90 have a lot to answer for ) he may well be rewarded			1
@entity92 looks at home in an @entity3 shirt if he keeps his discipline and then there are other talents like @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			2
up front @entity3 have their best options since @entity2			1
@entity102 has work - rate in abundance , he also has quality and goals			0
@entity75 has tied down his place in the centre of the @entity3 midfield @entity82 appears to have won the trust of manager @entity20 at last @entity111 was electric on friday and if he can replicate that at the @entity113 , then he certainly is a player opponents will be scared of			1
look at his trick and cross for @entity117 ’s goal – that ’s top class			0
@entity122 is on the brink of becoming an @entity3 legend , his focus and ambition has been sharpened by the captaincy and by the reality that he ’s running out of time to make a significant impact at a major tournament			1
@entity131 ’s pace could be useful , and of course @entity117 is ripping it up whenever he sets foot on a football pitch			0
when i think about the players @entity3 have , i feel optimistic			2
these players are playing in a way that is pleasing on the eye , credit to @entity20 for that			2
but then i think of the @entity9 and how horrible that was from the fans ' point of view			0
and then i remember every other tournament we ’ve been in since @entity2 and we ’ve either not played very well , or not got very far			1
@entity111 capped an electric performance against @entity30 on friday with a goal captaincy has improved @entity122 even more and he is on the verge of becoming an @entity3 legend @entity117 , who scored on debut against @entity30 , provides further reinforcement up front history demands a negative outlook and it ’s up to the manager and the players to prove that wrong			2
they ’re playing some good stuff , albeit in some straightforward qualifiers , but then some big nations are not sitting top of their groups right now - @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and @entity169 most notably			2
and @entity3 ’s group may be comfortable , but arguably the best performance came in the toughest game since the @entity9 , away to @entity173 , a team who got further at the @entity9 and who are above us in the world rankings			1
the challenge for @entity20 is whether he can maintain those standards when the opposition is tougher in @entity182 2016			0
there is one thing @entity20 has that so many previous @entity3 managers lacked			1
he has the trust of the players and that could be vital			0
@entity3 imploded in @entity189 in 2010 when @entity190 picked the wrong players and then treated them appallingly at the tournament			1
unlike @entity190 in 2010 , @entity20 has the complete trust of his squad @entity20 resisted calls to replace the in - form @entity102 with @entity117 and was proved correct for the @entity30 game on friday , @entity20 ignored the calls to start @entity117 and that was exactly the right thing to do			1
not because @entity117 is n't good enough – far from it			0
but @entity20 knew that if he dropped @entity102 the rest of the players would not – could not – respect that decision			0
@entity102 has been excellent in qualifying so far for @entity3 – there was no reason to drop a man who scored both goals in our toughest qualifier so far			0
if a player has done the job asked of him , there is no reason to drop him			0
if a manager drops that player , that decision instantly affects the relationship between players and manager			0
at international level , with limited time to nurture or repair relationships , a manager can not afford to lose the trust of his squad			0
there are lots of positives about the current @entity3 situation			0
but as fans can we afford to be positive when we ’ve been let down so many times in the last 20 years ? i want @entity3 to win the @entity19 , but until it happens it will always be an unrealistic dream .			1

@entity3 have their strongest and most talented squad in many years
@entity20 's team should be among the *favourites* for @entity29
the one weak link is alongside @entity41 in central defence
going forward , @entity3 have their best *attacking* options since @entity2
but @entity20 must dispel the *memories* of previous tournament failures
read : @entity166 vs @entity3 is the real test for @entity20 's new wave
