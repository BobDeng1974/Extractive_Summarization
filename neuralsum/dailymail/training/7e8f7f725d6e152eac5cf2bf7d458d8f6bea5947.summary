it will cost the federal government – taxpayers , that is – $ 50,000 for every person who gets health insurance under the @entity7 law , the @entity0 revealed on monday			1
the number comes from figures buried in a 15 - page section of the nonpartisan organization 's new ten - year budget outlook			0
the best - case scenario described by the @entity0 would result in ' between 24 million and 27 million ' fewer @entity14 being uninsured in 2025 , compared to the year before the @entity7 took effect			1
pulling that off will cost @entity17 about $ 1.35 trillion – or $ 50,000 per head			1
@entity19 to read the report the $ 2 trillion dollar man : president @entity22 was in @entity23 on monday when the @entity0 reported the federal government 's gross costs for a decade of @entity7 will be $ 1.993 trillion promises : @entity22 pledged in 2009 during a speech before a joint session of @entity29 that his health insurance proposal would cost $ 900 billion over ten years – a far cry short of current numbers the numbers are daunting : it will take $ 1.993 trillion , a number that looks like $ 1,993,000,000,000 , to provide insurance subsidies to poor and middle - class @entity14 , and to pay for a massive expansion of @entity40 and @entity39 ( @entity39 ) costs			1
offsetting that massive outlay will be $ 643 billion in new taxes , penalties and fees related to the @entity7 law			1
that revenue includes quickly escalating penalties – or ' taxes , ' as the @entity14 @entity49 described them – on people who resist @entity52 's command to buy medical insurance			1
it also includes income from a controversial medical device tax , which some @entity57 predict will be eliminated in the next two years			0
if they 're right , @entity7 's per - person cost would be even higher			0
president @entity22 pledged to members of @entity29 in 2009 , as his signature insurance overhaul law was being hotly debated , that ' the plan i 'm proposing will cost around $ 900 billion over 10 years			2
' it would be a significant discount if the @entity66 could return to that number today			0
@entity68 : the federal government will spend $ 50,000 for each person recruited to buy insurance or neroll in free medicaid through the @entity7 exchanges in that same speech , @entity22 claimed that there were ' more than 30 million @entity14 citizens who can not get coverage			1
' $ 900 billion spent on those people would equate to no more than $ 30,000 each – less than two - thirds of what the @entity0 now says the program will cost when the dust settles			2
the @entity0 and the @entity83 , a group of members from both houses of @entity29 , prepared monday 's report on the overall direction of the federal budget			0
they estimated that ' the net costs of the coverage provisions of the @entity92 ] will rise sharply as the effects of the act phase in from 2015 through 2017			0
' those costs will ' rise steadily through 2022 ' before leveling off for three years , the groups ' economists determined			0
but even at that point , the @entity7 program will cost the governemnt ' about $ 145 billion ' each year			2
that number does n't include the insurance premiums and out - of - pocket health care costs paid by @entity14 – only the government 's role in implementing the law and paying for its guarantees			2
and the law will still leave ' between 29 million and 31 million ' nonelderly @entity14 without medical insurance , says the @entity0			1
@entity0 january 2015 outlook on @entity7 uploaded by @entity110			0

*stunning* figure comes from @entity0 report that revised cost estimates for the next 10 years
government will spend $ 1.993 trillion over a decade and take in $ 643 billion in new taxes , penalties and fees related to @entity7
the $ 1.35 trillion net cost will result in ' between 24 million and 27 million ' fewer @entity14 being uninsured – a $ 50,000 price tag per person at best
the law will still leave ' between 29 million and 31 million ' nonelderly @entity14 without medical insurance
numbers assume @entity7 insurance exchange *enrollment* will *double* between now and 2025
