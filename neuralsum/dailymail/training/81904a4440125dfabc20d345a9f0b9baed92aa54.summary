@entity1 's @entity0 , 31 , pictured celebrating after coming 19th in the ladies ' downhill at the @entity4 for skier @entity0 the 19th place in the women ’s @entity6 downhill on the mountains above @entity9 today was as good as a gold medal after the glamour girl dubbed @entity1 ’s ‘ bionic woman ’ defied medical science to compete in @entity13			1
the 31 - year - old is a testament to the skill of surgeons and her own courage having overcome an astonishing 42 fractures and four career threatening breaks - one where her ankle bone ripped through her ski boot - to ski in her fourth @entity25			1
she only returned to the competitive ski slopes in january after a broken leg and took part in an historic race that saw the first ever tie in the history of the @entity25 when @entity31 , of @entity32 , and @entity34 @entity33 recorded exactly the same time to share the gold medal in the alpine downhill			1
miss @entity0 , who credited her friend @entity37 with helping her overcome her horrific injuries and reach @entity9 , finished 1.86 seconds behind the pair but was jubilant as she finished , breaking into a huge smile , punching the air three times and shouting : ' yes , @entity43 ... ’ still beaming minutes later , she said : ‘ i know it sounds crazy to some people , especially when we have such a strong team here in @entity9 , but 19th is a gold for me			1
‘ after what i ’ve been through , it ’s amazing justice			2
i ’m swelling with pride and i ’m on a buzz			2
’ seven other skiers fell yesterday in difficult conditions , and miss @entity0 admitted she had been as ‘ loose and a goose ’ on the course			1
she added : ‘ when i made the commitment to come here it was about personal goals			2
i never put any statistics on it , if i had then top 20 would have been massively over super-ceding what i expected			2
i ’ve done this against all odds and i ’m very proud			0
’ determined : miss @entity0 has been dubbed @entity1 's ' bionic woman ' because of her injuries miss @entity0 only returned to competing on the slopes in january after breaking her leg delighted : miss @entity0 said 19th place was as good as gold after what she has been through those odds could not have been more heavily stacked against the @entity75 on @entity76 , who finished 11th in both the @entity78 and @entity79 , after a life of crippling injuries that began at the age of 12 when she broke her neck and had two vertebrae fused together			1
in @entity9 , she carries around an x-ray of her neck in case she is in an accident and doctors want to prize the vertebrae open			0
other injuries sustained since she first put on a pair of skis at the age of 18 months have injured a broken jaw , broken bones in both arms and legs , damage to the head and face - her goggles cut into her left eyebrow - back and pelvis			1
she needed surgery on bone spurs in her feet , broke an ankle and has other problems with damage to her feet			0
she has broken her right leg three times and three years ago feared she might die after an 80mph crash on the slopes in @entity115 , @entity116 , that saw her airlifted on a stretcher from the slopes			1
‘ when i was coming down the mountain , on a stretcher beneath the helicopter , i thought i was dying			0
i have never known pain like it , ’ she said			0
crippling injuries : miss @entity0 has broken her right leg three times action shot : @entity0 during her run in the women 's @entity127 at the @entity129 miss @entity0 's first serious injury came when she was just 12 - years - old and broke her neck ' i did it ! ' : miss @entity0 gives a thumbs up to a photographer after her run ‘ i could feel my leg was hot and moist ... from photographs , i have been shown that my ski boot liner had become lodged inside my leg with bones and blood everywhere			1
the doctors were pretty shocked			0
’ a 38cm rod holding her bones together was locked inside her leg			2
‘ it goes all the way from my ankle to my knee , and i have a few screws in there , ’ she said , ‘ but i will do anything for the sport			0
’ that determination was to be again threatened in august when she broke the same leg again , an injury that put her @entity9 place in doubt until the last minute			2
she took the highly unusual move of writing to the ski team ’s chief , asking for a @entity9 place and promising she would be fit to compete despite medical fears			2
she pays tribute to the @entity168 ’s daughter @entity37 , an @entity6 equestrian medallist in @entity169 , as playing a key part in her recovery from the worst of her injuries			1
@entity0 after the @entity173 at the @entity174 on monday patriotic : miss @entity0 shows off her nails complete with @entity178 designs held together : @entity0 tweeted a photo of her leg that had stood up to the challenge of the race proud : miss @entity0 says she is ' swelling with pride ' at her achievement miss @entity0 said : ‘ after my first big accident , which was back in 2010 , i felt like i wanted to escape a little bit			1
@entity37 invited me to come and stay with her for a while and watch her train			0
well , i have never seen anyone train as hard as her			0
‘ we would get up at 6.30am most mornings			0
i would watch her train for an hour and a half on one horse			0
i ’d say : ‘ that ’s great			0
can we can get some breakfast now ? ’ but she ’d reply : “ i have got four other horses to do this on ”			0
i could n’t believe it			0
‘ as an athlete , you always think you work harder than everyone else			0
but when i saw @entity37 and what she does , i just had a massive respect for her as both an athlete and as a person			0
’ however , it is not only physical injury that miss @entity0 , whose full name is @entity212 after @entity214 ’s character in the 1961 film ‘ @entity215 ’ , but also finding the money to chase her @entity6 dream			1
apart from renting out a room in her @entity222 home , she and her fiancé , alpine skier @entity218 , organised @entity224 - themed black - tie dinner for more than 170 guests , including fellow stars of @entity227 , that raised £ 36,000 to pay for training			2
miss @entity0 ’s final race - she has said this is her last @entity25 - will be in the @entity232 slalom on saturday			1
