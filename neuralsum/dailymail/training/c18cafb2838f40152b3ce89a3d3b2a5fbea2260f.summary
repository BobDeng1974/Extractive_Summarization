@entity0 is getting tough with his under - performing @entity2 squad and insists that player reputations mean nothing to him			1
the @entity2 manager won his first four matches in charge at the club , after taking over in the summer , but has since lost two and drawn two			2
they now face a tricky tie against @entity12 on wednesday night in the @entity13 to turn that form around , where places for saturday 's north @entity17 derby against @entity18 are up for grabs			1
@entity0 passes on instructions to his @entity2 side during the home defeat against @entity23 @entity0 expresses his frustration during @entity2 's defeat to @entity26 on sunday one of the difficulties the former @entity29 boss faces is utilising a squad largely assembled under @entity31 , in a period when chairman @entity33 sanctioned more than £ 100million worth of transfers after @entity35 moved to @entity36 for a world record fee			1
some of the larger deals included signing @entity39 from @entity40 for £ 26million @entity41 from @entity42 for £ 25.7million and @entity43 from @entity44 at a cost of £ 17million			0
but when asked if reputations meant anything to him , @entity0 replied : ' no , i select the team , but they , the players , show me			2
we have 25 or 26 players and they are all in the squad			0
if i decide you play , you play , but the name is nothing for me when i pick my team			0
' their recent poor form was particularly apparent in the shock slump at home to @entity26 on sunday , when they lost 1 - 0 to a side bottom of the league			1
@entity0 revealed that he has been ' straight ' with his players that the performance , in which they had 63 per cent possession but only one shot on target , was not acceptable			2
' to build a winning mentality and a winning team , sometimes you need to lose , you need a big hit in your face to change sometimes the energy and realise that you need to fight every game , ' @entity0 added , displaying an adept understanding of metaphor despite his , at times , patchy @entity80			1
@entity81 scored the only goal of the game on sunday as @entity26 condemned @entity2 to defeat the @entity2 manager celebrates their last - gasp winner at @entity86 on the opening day of the season ' you need to fight every training session , you need to play like a team and you need to show more energy like a team in the competition			1
' the @entity12 match is the players ' last chance to impress upon @entity0 that they deserve a place in the side for the derby match at the weekend			1
and the @entity100 has no problem with dropping those who he feels are not playing to the standard he expects , regardless of their price tag			0
he added : ' we analyse every game and every performance and after we decide			0
for me , when i pick the best players for playing in each game , always i analyse how was the last performance			0
' and i have no problem to pick different players in different competitions or if it 's not in a good moment , if you need to change , you change			0
it 's not a big problem			0

@entity0 expects his under - performing @entity2 squad to raise their game after a poor run of form
