by @entity0 prince @entity1 has called for @entity3 's cities to abandon glitzy skyscrapers in favour of smaller ' mid-rise ' buildings in order to ease the housing crisis and allow more young people to own their own homes			1
the heir to the throne added that young people were being ' driven away ' by spiralling house prices , saying that the dream of buying a home was ' becoming further and further out of reach '			1
a report released by one of @entity1 's charities today warns against the influx of high - rise buildings into @entity24 , which it claims are making the @entity3 's capital indistinguishable from cities such as @entity28 and @entity29			1
plea : prince @entity1 has warned that young people are being frozen out of the housing market plan : a report compiled by one of the prince 's charity demanded a change to how @entity24 is built inspection : @entity1 inside a flat in @entity40 examining the living conditions of a local resident the prince was talking at the @entity44 in south west @entity24 , to mark the launch of the report by the @entity47			1
the report suggests mid-rise buildings should replace high - rise skyscrapers which it describes as ' glittering towers of exclusivity and luxury living '			2
@entity24 has recently seen the construction of prestigious but unaffordable buildings such as one @entity57 , the @entity58 and @entity59			2
statistics : @entity3 is not building enough new homes to meet the demand from citizens developers involved with the skyscrapers have been criticised for selling much of their space to foreign investors who do not intend to live in their multi-million - pound flats all year round			1
instead , the report calls for the construction of ' mid-rise ' buildings between five and eight storeys high - and the creation of community squares with mansion blocks which are affordable			1
across the @entity3 there is an annual need for 250,000 to 300,000 new homes , but only between 100,000 and 150,000 are being built each year			2
it has been predicted that be 2021 there will be a backlog of 1.1million homes			0
although one @entity57 is a lower - rise block , it was built in @entity86 , one of @entity24 's most expensive property markets , and marketed solely at the super rich , with owners of the 86 luxury apartments including oil barons and @entity93 sheiks			1
last year one of the apartments in the complex was on the market for £ 65million , while ten flats in the @entity58 have price tags of between £ 30million and £ 50million			0
prince @entity1 said today that the focus on ultra-prime housing had damaged young people 's prospects of buying a home			1
he said : ' home ownership for this generation is seemingly becoming further and further out of reach			2
' he added : ' @entity108 estimates that in only six years ' time the average @entity24 house price will have risen 40 per cent to £ 650,000			2
' this is n't sustainable and risks driving away talented young individuals who are starting their careers in @entity24 and spending most of their income on rent			2
' the prince suggested that high - rise buildings divorced from their surrounding created a sense of ' alienation and social dysfunction ' because they lead to social segregation with some areas dominated solely by the ultra-rich			0
he added : ' mid-rise buildings of between five and eight storeys make ecological sense too as they are more adaptable than high - rise , easier to build out of natural materials , are easier to repair and still work for people when the lift is broken or there is a power cut			0
' on the building side , mid-rise buildings also allow a greater diversity of developers and builders as the initial outlays required by high - rise buildings make it the business of relatively few			0
' criticism : buildings like one @entity57 are closed off to all but the wealthiest people in @entity3 society @entity147 : but the @entity58 does little to help most @entity148 , according to the new report @entity150 , executive director of the @entity47 , insisted that abandoning skyscrapers and restoring parks and gardens would be truer to @entity24 's original character			1
' @entity155 looks like @entity24 - not @entity28 or @entity29 , ' he told the @entity156			1
' if you have six or seven floors you can still get light on the other side of the road , you can still create green spaces and it fits with the existing vernacular			0
what we are really saying is " more @entity24 please "			0
' the report also uses @entity168 as an example of success , with classic haussman era apartment blocks in the centre of the city are only around six storeys high			0
mr @entity150 also suggested that new developments should be accessible to mix of people from different backgrounds , including key workers living in affordable homes			0
last week a leading planning expert warned that parts of @entity3 would soon resemble ' bland homogenous metropolises ' thanks to an emphasis on office blocks and shopping centres at the expense of more organic neighbourhood growth			0
contrast : areas such as @entity193 are popular because of their ' mid-rise ' scale , the report says the foundation 's report recommends the use of brownfield sites and increasing the density of the inner city , as well as building major new developments and restoring housing estates			0
it focuses primarily on @entity24 , where inflation in house prices has been even higher than elsewhere , but suggests that its conclusions are widely applicable across other parts of the @entity3			1
the report reads : ' the problem of housing failures , either in quality or quantity - as well as of the ubiquitous skyscraper model that is beginning to render city skylines indistinguishable from one another , while on the ground streetscapes are brutalised - can be recognised in cities the world over			0

prince warns buying a home is ' further and further out of reach ' for young @entity3
calls for more community - focused neighbourhoods with parks and gardens
speaks out as charity report calls for end to expensive new homes which only super rich can afford
report *author* says @entity24 is becoming a clone of @entity28 and @entity29
