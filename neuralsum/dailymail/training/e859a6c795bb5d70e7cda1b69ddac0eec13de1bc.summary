@entity0 has released a stunning new image of a mysterious galaxy that could help reveal how the universe formed - and looks like a still for a sci - fi classic			1
called @entity9 , this new @entity8 / @entity7 @entity6 image shows the galaxy in front of a backdrop of distant galaxies			2
@entity9 335 is part of a galaxy group containing three other galaxies , and located in the @entity16 60 million light - years away			1
called @entity9 , this new @entity8 / @entity7 @entity6 image shows the galaxy in front of a backdrop of distant galaxies			2
a lenticular galaxy is a type of galaxy which is intermediate between an elliptical galaxy and a spiral galaxy in galaxy morphological classification schemes			1
they are disc galaxies ( like spiral galaxies ) which have used up or lost most of their interstellar matter and therefore have very little ongoing star formation			2
they consist mainly of aging stars ( like elliptical galaxies )			0
as @entity34 galaxies have only ill - defined spiral arms they are easily mistaken for elliptical galaxies if they are seen inclined face - on or edge - on as @entity9 here			1
experts say it is a type of galaxy known as a @entity34			2
as seen in this image , the disk of @entity9 appears edge - on from the vantage point of @entity44			2
this makes it harder for astronomers to classify it , as most of the characteristics of a galaxy â€™s characteristics - the arms of a spiral or the bar across the center - are only visible on its face			1
@entity34 types are lenticular galaxies are an intermediate state in galaxy morphological classification schemes between true spiral and elliptical galaxies			1
they have a thin stellar disk and a bulge , like spiral galaxies , but in contrast to typical spiral galaxies they have used up most of the interstellar medium			0
only a few new stars can be created out of the material that is left and the star formation rate is very low			0
hence , the population of stars in @entity34 galaxies consists mainly of aging stars , very similar to the star population in elliptical galaxies			0
as @entity34 galaxies have only ill - defined spiral arms they are easily mistaken for elliptical galaxies if they are seen inclined face - on or edge - on as @entity9 here			1
and indeed , despite the morphological differences between @entity34 and elliptical class galaxies , they share some common characteristics , like typical sizes and spectral features			0
both classes are also deemed " early - type " galaxies , because they are evolving passively			0
however , while elliptical galaxies may be passively evolving when we observe them , they have usually had violent interactions with other galaxies in their past			0
the @entity99 ( @entity100 5866 ) , a lenticular galaxy in the @entity103 constellation			1
in contrast , @entity34 galaxies are either aging and fading spiral galaxies , which never had any interactions with other galaxies , or they are the aging result of a single merger between two spiral galaxies in the past			0
the exact nature of these galaxies is still a matter of debate .			0

@entity116 located in the @entity16 60 million light - years away
is a ' lenticular galaxy ' which has no spiral arms
