by @entity0 published : 11:41 est , 7 may 2013 updated : 19:53 est , 7 may 2013 a headmistress wrote to a mother telling her to postpone her daughter ’s birthday party because it is on the night before her younger sister ’s exams			1
@entity7 was outraged when she received a letter from @entity9 suggesting the party for her older daughter @entity11 , who is no longer a pupil at the school , might prevent 11 - year - old @entity13 from preparing for her year 6 sats			1
to add insult to injury , the letter was riddled with errors			2
miss @entity7 , with daughters @entity11 and @entity13 , was asked to consider postponing the birthday party miss @entity7 , 50 , claims teachers at @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 , found out about @entity11 ’s grease - themed 13th birthday party and quizzed @entity13 about who was going and how long it would last			1
some of @entity13 ’s classmates had also been invited			2
miss @entity7 then received a letter from mrs @entity9 , suggesting that the timing of the two - hour party , due to end at 9.30pm on sunday , was inappropriate			1
miss @entity7 , of @entity23 , said : ‘ they are blowing the whole thing out of proportion			1
i am a responsible parent and said to other parents that if they did n’t want their children to come , or if they wanted to pick them up early , then i would n’t be offended			0
‘ but i feel very strongly that this is a parental matter and not something the school should get involved in			2
‘ the kids have worked extremely hard for these tests and there ’s nothing wrong with a bit of rest and fun to let their hair down			0
it might even improve their performance			0
‘ now @entity13 is upset about it and thinks we ’ve done something wrong			0
when she was taken out of lunch and asked who was going she did n’t know what to say , she told me she was so embarrassed			0
’ @entity9 of @entity22 in @entity23 suggested to miss @entity7 that her timing could be better the council housing officer added : ‘ the teachers are worried about @entity61 results , which are more about the school ’s reputation than anything else			1
’ miss @entity7 also pointed out grammatical errors made in the letter , including misplaced apostrophes and a lower case letter at the start of a sentence			2
it also makes reference to @entity13 ’s ‘ brother ’ even though she has two sisters , @entity11 and @entity75 , who is 16			0
miss @entity7 said that the party had been all but ruined by the school			1
she said : ‘ there was going to be about ten girls going in all and now it looks like there will be just five			0
some of the mums have stopped their daughters going			0
school head mrs @entity9 wanted to ensure all pupils at her school , right , were rested and ready to sit their sats ‘ @entity11 has said she ’d rather not have the party now but it ’s still going ahead			1
’ mrs @entity9 said she was concerned about the party and had merely suggested another date might be more suitable			1
‘ sats are the culmination of our pupils ’ primary education and i wanted to make absolutely sure that the family were aware these important exams begin the next day			0
they can then make their own choices based on all the information , ’ she said .			0
