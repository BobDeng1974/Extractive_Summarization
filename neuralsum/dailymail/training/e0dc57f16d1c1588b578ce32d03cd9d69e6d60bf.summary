@entity5 , 29 , smashed the existing record for acceleration over a mile - long stretch while driving a highly - tuned @entity9 in @entity10			0
the daring motor sports enthusiast rocketed to an incredible 257mph in the humble car , which has been souped up with a 5.4 - litre v8 engine and two massive turbo - chargers			2
it was not even the @entity10 's car - with mr @entity5 driving the @entity4 for local businessman @entity33			2
the @entity9 was built by @entity34 , with the @entity36 company saying the car 's power was ' conservatively estimated ' at around 2,000bhp - twice as much as a @entity39			1
but while a @entity39 will set its owner back £ 1million , the @entity4 will cost a mere £ 275,000			1
yet despite going faster than any other car over the distance , adrenaline junkie mr @entity5 is confident he can do even better			0
highly tuned : the car 's power is ' conservatively estimated ' at around 2,000bhp - twice as much as a £ 1m @entity39 designated daredevil : mr @entity5 was driving the @entity4 for local businessman @entity33 revved up : the adrenaline junkie was already doing more than 200mph at the halfway stage gear shift : next , the car lovers hope to take the @entity4 to a eyebrow - raising 260mph using the lower gears he said : ' i was impressed with how hard it pulled in fourth and fifth gears on that run			1
' i think i can do better in the lower gears next time and we can run an even better speed			0
' we want to go 260			0
' the previous record on a mile - stretch was 250.1mph , set by a similarly tuned car			0
