by @entity0 a psychopathic sex criminal described as being ' very high risk to women ' and subject to three restraining orders can appeal against wearing his tag after claiming it violates his human rights			1
@entity11 , 47 , has argued that when magistrates forbade him from stepping outside his home without the device they breached his right to a private and family life			1
@entity19 , from @entity18 , is now at the centre of a vital test case , after a judge ruled he may have cause for complaint , opening the way for him to argue his case before the @entity27			1
argument : sex criminal @entity11 , 47 , is to appeal against wearing as tag as it violates his human rights diagnosed psychopath , @entity19 , who has an antisocial and narcissistic personality disorder , has a long history of offences of violence , kidnapping , dishonesty , harassment and no less than 12 sex crimes			1
reports have assessed him as ' a very high risk ' to women and he is one of only a handful of sex offenders on the @entity50 ’s ' critical public protection ' list on the basis that he represents an ' imminent risk of serious harm '			1
drug user , @entity19 , who is currently in custody , having breached the terms of a sexual offences prevention order ( @entity58 ) , is already subject to three restraining orders made to protect adult women who had been harrassed or subjected to violence by him			1
medical evidence indicated that he displayed high levels of deceit and manipulation and minimal emphathy or remorse for his crimes			2
@entity19 is subject to a @entity58 which forbids him from approaching , enticing or otherwise seeking to communicate with any female he knows or suspects to be involved in prostitution without reasonable cause			2
he was arrested for a suspected breach of that order in october 2012 , after he was spotted in a red light district			2
that was 11 days after magistrates ordered him not to leave his home without wearing a tag , formally known as a @entity85			1
example : @entity19 is now at the centre of a vital test case , after a judge ruled he may have cause for complaint , opening the way for him to argue his case before the @entity27 @entity19 says the indefinite requirement to wear a tag every time he leaves his home amounts to a violation of his right to respect for his home and privacy , enshrined in @entity102			1
his complaints were rejected by the @entity104 last year			0
however , in a case which is bound to have a crucial impact on treatment of dangerous sex offenders in the community , he has now been granted permission to appeal			1
describing the facts of the case as ‘ very stark indeed ’ , @entity111 said it was arguable that the requirement to wear a tag indefinitely , and thus submit to ‘ continuous surveillance ’ by the police , went beyond the terms of the @entity119			1
@entity19 was also granted leave to pursue his human rights arguments before a three - judge @entity122			1
his counsel , @entity124 , argued that indefinite tagging was ‘ a very substantial interference with his right to personal autonomy ’			0
he added : ' @entity19 had no choice as to whether to wear a monitor			2
the monitoring allowed the police to locate him at all times			0
' that meant that there was potential to gain substantial data regarding his activities			0
that was a denial of privacy			0
' it also meant he was unable to undertake lawful actions that he did not wish the police to be aware of			0
' no date was set for the full hearing of @entity19 ’ appeal			2
article 8 of the @entity151 states that : everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life , his home and his correspondence			0
there shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security , public safety or the economic well - being of the country , for the prevention of disorder or crime , for the protection of health or morals , or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others			2
controversially , the article has previously been cited by foreign criminals fighting deportation at the completion of their prison sentences , claiming they have a right to family life in the @entity187			0
it is thought there are currently about 4,000 overseas convicts living in the @entity187 that the government wants to remove but is blocked from doing so by human rights laws			1
@entity194 rapist , @entity193 , 31 , who held a knife to a pregnant woman ’s throat as he assaulted her , is among the many criminals who can not be deported from @entity187 because of rules on a right to family life			0
@entity193 was jailed for ten years in 2007 after he threatened to kill his ‘ vulnerable ’ victim and repeatedly raped her in her own home			0
he was set to be deported on release and @entity205 lawyers warned immigration judges of his dangerous nature and a continued lack of respect for the law			0
but in december last year he was deemed to have a right to a family life under @entity150 and released			0
@entity193 does not have any children or a wife in @entity187 , but his mother and siblings live here .			0
