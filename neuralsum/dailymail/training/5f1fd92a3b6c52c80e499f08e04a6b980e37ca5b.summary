@entity8 , also a guest on the talk show , said that he too became upset at @entity10 and might have hit him had @entity3 not lashed out			1
@entity3 faces up to five years in jail if convicted of politically - motivated hooliganism in a trial his supporters fear has overtones of media censorship			1
@entity18 media magnate @entity3 , pictured left arriving at a court in @entity4 , is on trial for allegedly punching businessman @entity10 , pictured right , because of political hatred @entity8 was one of the first millionaires after @entity23 crumbled and previously knew both mr @entity3 and mr @entity10			1
asked if he was surprised construction tycoon @entity10 seemed ' high ' , he said : ' no - as far as i know it was quite a typical state for @entity10			1
' questioned on what he meant by ' high ' , @entity8 said : ' i meant that he was under the influence of drugs			2
' asked if he was a specialist in understanding the influence of narcotics , he said : ' sadly i had tragedies linked to moments when people went under the influence of drugs			0
' i am not an expert - but i can understand when a person is on drugs			0
' @entity3 owns a @entity18 investigative newspaper and later bought the @entity40 titles and the @entity41 , before handing control of his @entity44 interests to his son amid fears he could be jailed			1

they point out @entity53 leader @entity52 accused him of behaving like a hooligan			0
the hearing went ahead today as previously without @entity10 , who said he could not come to court because he was in @entity57 on strict bail conditions			1
bizarrely , it now appears he is relaxing by the sea in @entity61			0
@entity8 told the court that on the tv show - before @entity3 threw his punch - ' there was a moment when @entity10 got very close to me , very close and sort of reached towards me with an offer to massage me '			1
he stressed : ' had he come a bit closer it would be me answering the court today , not @entity3			1
' asked by @entity10 's lawyer if throwing punches was the right way to resolve a dispute , @entity8 - who several years ago gave up business for a time to live like a tsarist peasant - said : ' the way i was brought up , i find it the most adequate answer one man can give another man when he was offended in such way			1
show : mr @entity3 ( left ) lashed out at @entity10 during a @entity18 tv debate in 2011 excuse : mr @entity10 is said to be unable to attend the trial as he is stuck in @entity57 ' i find it a very soft way of stopping another man from not going further			1
' @entity3 acted as a man that stopped in as soft as possible a manner a rude and offensive person			2
' on the show , there were ' moments when @entity10 was constantly throwing his arms about - and he 's got long arms , so when he gesticulates his arms reached out almost to the faces of people sitting next to him			1
' at some point his arms were close to @entity3 's face			1
' judge @entity103 asked the witness if he was in friendly relations with mr @entity3			2
' no , if anything i 've got a little grudge against him - but it wo n't influence my testimony			0
i have known @entity3 for some time			2
' he added : ' he is quite a calm man - it is impossible for me to imagine him starting a conflict			0
' even when me and him had a conflict , he sent complaints to the police			0
this is his way , to always act within the legal boundaries			0
he is a person of a system			0
' backstage before the programme started @entity10 was saying ' how long should we stand people like @entity3 with his constant lies and tricks , ' he said			1
' i felt uncomfortable , i did n't like it			0
he was hopping around , he was interrupting people , he was running around			0
' he told the judge there was no political element to the tv show or the dispute			0
the co-presenter of the show , @entity130 , also claimed @entity10 ' behaved provocatively '			2
' @entity3 was calm enough until a certain moment and nothing predicted such behaviour , ' he said			2
just before @entity3 's infamous attack - which was seen worldwide on the web - @entity130 said @entity10 had told him to ' shut up ' while swinging his hand towards the media owner			1
@entity10 also muttered about ' wanting to punch him in the face ' , he said			2
' i thought it was offensive , ' @entity8 said			2
he was ' invading @entity3 's personal space '			1
seconds before striking , @entity3 asked who he wanted to strike in the face , he told the court			1
he told the judge @entity3 did not talk about politics - a key point because he is accused of hooliganism based on political hatred			1
today was the first time @entity3 had called witnesses			0
he was accompanied yesterday in court by his wife @entity153 , the @entity154 - born model and fashion icon			0
prosecution witnesses included people who had seen the two punches on tv			0
one was stopped randomly as she was getting off a bus in @entity4 and asked if she would testify			0
