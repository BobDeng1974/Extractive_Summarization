long - term use of hormonal contraceptives can double the risk of brain cancer , a study has found			1
but scientists stressed that the likelihood of any individual woman developing the disease was in reality extremely small			0
researchers used health data from @entity12 to compare 317 women diagnosed with glioma , a type of brain tumour , and 2,126 who were free of the disease			2
all were aged 15 to 49 , and therefore young enough to be using contraceptives			0
women who had ever used an oral contraceptive or hormone - releasing intra-uterine device ( @entity23 ) , or coil , were 50 per cent more likely to develop brain cancer than those who had not			1
risk : long - term use of hormonal contraceptives can double the risk of brain cancer , @entity28 scientists say the difference in risk increased to 90 per cent , just under double , for women who had used one of the contraceptives for five years or more			1
@entity37 - only contraceptives were most strongly associated with glioma , raising the risk almost three-fold			1
in terms of cancer type , the risk was greatest for gliobastoma multiforme , the most aggressive type of primary brain tumour			2
@entity12 lead researcher dr @entity46 , from @entity47 and @entity48 , said : ' it is important to keep this apparent increase in risk in context			1
' in a population of women in the reproductive age , including those who use hormonal contraceptives , you would anticipate seeing five in 100,000 people develop a glioma annually , according to the nationwide @entity12 @entity61			2
' while we found a statistically significant association between hormonal contraceptive use and glioma risk , a risk - benefit evaluation would still favour the use of hormonal contraceptives in eligible users			1
' the findings are reported in the @entity71			0
the hormone progesterone is known to increase proliferation of high - grade glioma cells called astrocytomas in the laboratory			2
it is also thought to raise levels of growth factors , natural substances that stimulate cell growth			0
but the scientists said it was impossible to form any conclusions about how progesterone - containing contraceptives might influence brain cancer development			1
experts commenting on the results emphasised the importance of keeping them in perspective			0
sir @entity91 , @entity92 at @entity93 , said : ' glioma is fortunately very rare			0
hormones : women who had ever used an oral contraceptive or hormone - releasing intra-uterine device ( @entity23 - pictured ) , or coil , were 50 per cent more likely to develop brain cancer than those who had not ' even if oral contraceptives did increase the risk to the extent suggested by this study , it would only mean one extra glioma each year for every 50,000 women taking the pill			1
' suppose , however , all these women changed to a less effective form of contraception and 10,000 of them got pregnant : we would then expect one extra mother and 40 extra babies to die			0
' statistician professor @entity115 , from @entity116 , said : ' previous scares about possible increased health risks from contraceptive pills have had bad consequences for public health			0
' on hearing that taking the @entity123 might lead to an increased risk of certain diseases , some women switched away from the @entity123 to less reliable forms of contraception , or none at all			2
' that increased numbers of abortions , and exposed the women to health risks from pregnancy and abortion that were generally far greater than any reduction in risk from the diseases in the scare			2
' brain tumours are not at all common			0
' so even if long - term pill use does double the risk , well , twice a very small risk is still a very small risk			2
' cancer : in terms of cancer type , the risk was greatest for gliobastoma multiforme ( pictured ) , the most aggressive type of primary brain tumour @entity152 , professor of cancer epidemiology at the @entity93 , said : ' it is important to remember that association does not necessarily imply causation			1
' this type of study is particularly prone to bias as it relies on routine data and information on other possible risk factors was not available			0
' it may be that pill use is simply correlated with another important risk factor			0
' moreover , the findings are somewhat contrary to the findings of other studies which have reported either no association or a small reduction in risk of brain tumours associated with oral contraceptive pill use			1
' he added : ' even if the results are taken at face value the findings have limited implications for women who take the pill			0
' the chance of a woman developing a brain cancer in he lifetime is approximately 5 in 1000			1
this would be increased to just 8 in a thousand			0
' the oral contraceptive pill has many other beneficial effects			1
' for example , a 20 - year - old woman who takes the oral contraceptive for ten years will reduce her chance of getting ovarian cancer by about 15 in 1000			1
' a much bigger reduction than any possible increase in the risk of brain cancer			1
' women should not base their decision on whether or not to take the contraceptive pill on the results of this study			0
