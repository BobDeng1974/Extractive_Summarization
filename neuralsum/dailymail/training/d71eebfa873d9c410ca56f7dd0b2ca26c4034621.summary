in @entity27 , the only other state to legalize marijuana , existing medical marijuana dispensaries can begin selling for recreational use in january			1

@entity48 , 50 , however , does n't like pot himself			2
he said : ‘ if people are going to eat a stupid drug , they should eat my stupid drug			1

’ pot and patisseries looking to cook up a profit : @entity83 , a @entity85 - trained @entity84 pastry chef @entity83 had swapped her three - decade - old home - furnishing store and interior design business in @entity27 for a life of world travel when she learned some devastating news : her eldest daughter had leukemia			1
