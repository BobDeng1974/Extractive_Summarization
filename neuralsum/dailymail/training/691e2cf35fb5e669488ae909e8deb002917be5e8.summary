by @entity0 published : 09:27 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 10:42 est , 16 october 2013 staring into the camera , the girl 's striking blue eyes are full of unshed tears			0
and she is n't alone			0
the girl in the polka dot headscarf and her family are just some of the thousands of people who have crossed the border into @entity12 in a bid to escape the slaughter in @entity15			1
although the raging civil war has cost her family their home , the girl is luckier than most			0
an ethnic @entity20 , she has managed to escape the fighting that has taken the lives of thousands of her compatriots as well as the bouts of ethnic violence that have taken the lives of @entity20 in @entity15 , @entity12 , @entity28 and @entity29 over the last century			1
now she and other @entity20 refugees are the subject of a series of stunning photographs by @entity36 snapper @entity34 who travelled to @entity12 last month to meet them			1
refugee : this girl , a @entity15 kurd , was forced to flee with her family to a refugee camp in the @entity12 @entity20 city of @entity43 after her home was bombed @entity45 : the raging conflict in @entity15 has spared no one , young or old , and as a result , vast numbers have been forced to make the perilous journey into @entity12 ' we know the @entity20 people well because they suffered a lot under the @entity55 regime , ' he explains			1
' they were killed with chemical weapons in @entity57			0
' since the fall of the dictator , @entity12 has become a safer place for @entity20 thanks to the creation of a @entity20 statelet within the country where many of those fleeing violence in @entity15 have taken shelter			1
' nowadays , many @entity20 @entity15 refugees have found shelter in @entity70 , ' adds @entity34			1
' it was interesting to meet people who have led such a difficult life and who are trying to build a new nation			0
' the girl in the polka dot scarf lives in a refugee camp in @entity43 [ in @entity70 ] and had to leave her village [ in @entity15 ] two months ago after it was bombed			1
they have nothing , just the help of the other @entity20			1
' haunted : this young boy 's face bears traces of his recent ordeal			0
his blond hair and green eyes are thought to be the result of @entity90 who married @entity20 women pretty : this little girl is now safe in @entity70 but it was n't always the case - @entity12 @entity20 became victims of @entity55 's chemical weapons in 1988 tough times : for this boy and his family , the onset of winter is something to be dreaded thanks to the precarious nature of life in the refugee camps and life in the refugee camp is far from easy			1
' @entity110 will come with the rains , and everybody fears the worst , ' explains @entity34			2
' her beauty hides a cruel reality			0
' despite their difficult circumstances , @entity34 reveals that not only were the refugees happy to let him photograph them , they proved generous and welcoming hosts			2
' they all welcomed me as a friend and offered me food and drink , even when they had nothing for them , ' he remembers			0
other portraits in the series include that of an older woman , in a vibrant cerulean headscarf , and a little blond boy whose face still bears traces of a recent ordeal			0
most striking of all is the fact that nearly all have stunning blue eyes - unusual among @entity141 peoples for whom liquid dark brown is the norm			0
' they are not @entity145 , ' explains @entity34			2
' they do not want you to call them @entity149 are @entity20 and it is different			2
their story is a mix of migration and invasion			0
' many say that @entity90 came during the last century and felt in love with @entity20 women , which is where the blue eyes are thought to come from			2
' all smiles : despite their precarious existence , photographer @entity34 says the @entity20 refugees were wonderfully kind and welcoming cruel reality : the story of the @entity20 people is one of invasion and migration with the majority of @entity20 now split between @entity28 , @entity12 , @entity29 and @entity15 the 30 million strong population of ethnic @entity20 originated in @entity29 and now live mainly in @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity12 and @entity15 , although a significant diaspora is also to be found in @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity90 and @entity177			1
an ancient people , the first mention of the @entity20 came in 3000 @entity180 , when a @entity182 tablet spoke of the land of ' @entity184 ' and referred to the ' @entity185 ' [ mountain ] people			2
there are also numerous legends associated with the origins of the @entity20 , including one which claims they are the descendants of @entity194 € ™ s angelic servants or @entity195 , who were sent to @entity196 to find 500 beautiful maidens for the king 's harem			1
but by the time the @entity195 returned , the king had died and the servants settled in the mountains , married the women themselves and founded the @entity20 people			2
by the early mediaeval period , the @entity20 clans ruled mini-kingdoms across the @entity141 before coming under the rule of the @entity209 sultans of @entity210			2
although the @entity20 had lived peacefully for much of the @entity209 period , the 19th century brought the birth of the @entity20 nationalist movement which first reared its head as a political entity in 1880 under @entity216			0
the uprising was suppressed but nationalism was not forgotten			0
in the years after the @entity221 and the end of the @entity209 , repeated rebellions in @entity220 led to the imposition of martial law while in @entity12 , @entity20 nationalism was met with the tanks and bombs of the ruling @entity228			1
by the 1970s , the @entity229 or @entity229 , had become entrenched in eastern @entity28 , fighting running battles with @entity220 armed forces and considered a terrorist organisation by the @entity233 and many @entity235 nations			0
but it was in 1980s @entity12 where the @entity20 would meet their deadliest enemy - the chemical weapons of @entity55 which killed more than 5,000 people in a 1988 attack on the town of @entity242			1
today , the @entity20 are still spread far and wide but the peace process in @entity28 is beginning to improve the lot of those living between the @entity220 army and the @entity229			0
in @entity12 meanwhile , the autonomous region of @entity70 in the north has provided a haven for local @entity12 @entity20 and those fleeing from the conflict in neighbouring @entity15 .			1

@entity36 photographer @entity34 travelled to refugee camps near the town of @entity43 in northern @entity12
@entity43 is part of @entity70 , an *unrecognised* autonomous statelet handed to the @entity20 after @entity55 's defeat
many of @entity34 's subjects have been forced out of their @entity15 homes after being bombed out of their homes
