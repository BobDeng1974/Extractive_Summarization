by @entity0 a-list celebrities are regularly pictured with flawless make - up - free skin day after day			1
so for us lesser mortals , it comes as some relief to learn that it 's not just good genes causing their healthy glow			2
@entity11 dermatologist @entity10 , who counts @entity12 among her clients , has revealed that there is a whole host of cosmetic treatments that allow stars to embrace the no - make - up look with such confidence			1
dr @entity10 tells @entity20 that increased volume ( or plumpness ) , muscle tightness and removal of imperfections are the three key principles to follow in order to give the face a more youthful appearance			1
flawless : many stars use cosmetic procedures such as @entity33 to restore their skin without having to go under the knife and with a combination of dermal fillers , toxins , ultrasound therapy and topical treatments , she can restore tired , lined and blotchy skin without the client having to go under the knife			1
@entity45 fillers $ 558 ( average ) dr @entity10 says dermal fillers , such as @entity48 , are used to restore fullness to the face			1
' if you 've lost volume , you want to give the volume back where you lost it , ' she explains			2
typically this occurs in the upper part of the cheek , around the temples and in the hollow in front of the ear			2
‘ you fill that hollow , you lift the jowl that occurs at the lower part of the jawline			0
you ’re filling to lift the line , to lift the fold , ' she says			0
toxins $ 328 ( average ) if the patient ’s problem is in the facial muscles , typical of very expressive people , who are prone to squinting or raising their eyebrows , dr @entity10 says @entity33 and @entity73 are ideal for lifting and tightening – though , she adds , she will never administer a toxin to someone too young			1
' when we get someone who ’s in their twenties who comes in and says they want toxins to prevent lines , it ’s too early , ' she says			0
' when people start doing procedures before they even see problems sometimes that can lead to negative results because you are weakening the muscle with the toxin			0
and if you ’re going to start in your twenties and live to your nineties you ’re going to end up with a very thin , tissue paper - like skin			2
and i think we all know examples of certain celebrities who ’ve done that , ' she adds			0
i woke up like this : @entity12 ( left ) , dr @entity10 's client , and @entity104 ( right ) , @entity102 's client , appear effortlessly glowing @entity105 $ 1,000 and up for patients seeking results similar to a facelift without having to go under the knife , dr @entity10 recommends @entity110 , a non-invasive procedure that delivers ultrasound energy at two different layers of the face			1
' the first is the layer of the muscle that would be cut if you were having a facelift , ’ dr @entity10 says			1
‘ you ’re actually stimulating the production of new collagen , and over several months the face is lifting and that muscle is tightening			0
it ’s like shrink - wrap			2
' the second part of the energy , dr @entity10 explains , is delivered to the deep part of the skin , the dermis			1
‘ if you ’re tightening the muscle , you want to make sure the skin is tightening over it , ’ she says			0
‘ in tightening the skin , you see a new tone , a new texture and even improvement in the fine lines and wrinkles			0

laser treatment is favored by dr @entity10 too , who says : ' @entity159 resurfacing has almost zero downtime			1
it just makes microscopic tunnels in the skin that grow new collagen that 's not sun - damaged			2
' @entity166 toning $ 220 for home use , ms @entity102 , who works with @entity104 and @entity167 , recommends a product she sells on her website , called the @entity171			0
it uses ultrasonic 1 mhz technology for the face and body to help stimulate new collagen , elastin and cell renewal , resulting in a more contoured appearance			0
@entity180 treatments $ 15 and up for removing spots and imperfections , dr @entity10 suggests products with glycolic acids , skin lightening products like hydroquinone and even botanicals such as bayberry			1
