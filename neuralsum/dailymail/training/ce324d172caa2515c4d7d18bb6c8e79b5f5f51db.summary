by @entity0 a 10 - year - old primary school pupil weighs an astonishing 20 stone , figures have revealed			1
the child , who has not been named , narrowly topped the list of the most obese children in @entity7 and @entity8 , where the data was collected			1
the @entity11 pupil tipped the scales at 19st 7lbs , making them one of the heaviest children in the country			2
another child of the same year weighed just over 18st , a third weighed 18st 6lbs and a fourth weighed 16st 7lbs			1
shocking : the 10 - year - old child , who has not been named , is one of the fattest children in the country ( file picture ) the children were weighed at school as part of an annual child measurement programme and it is now known if they were male or female			1
the latest data has been supplied by the @entity28 , the official source of @entity31 data			2
@entity32 estimates there are about 10,000 primary school children in the area who are classed as either overweight or clinically obese - including a handful of local youngsters who weighed in at more than 16st during health checks in year 6			1
many will grow to become obese adults , increasing their risk of diabetes , heart attacks , strokes , cancer and other killer diseases			0
national figures released by the @entity28 in december revealed the proportion of @entity11 primary school children who are obese or overweight had actually fallen for the first time in six years			1
a third of year 6 pupils - 33.3 per cent - measured for the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) in 2012/13 were obese or overweight , compared to 33.9 per cent in the previous year			1
in reception , the number of obese and overweight children also fell in 2012/13 compared to the previous year and is lower than seven years ago			1
and in december , it was revealed a ten - year - old schoolgirl in @entity59 weighed at 22 stone 11lbs , closely followed by six youngsters of the same age who weighed 19 stone			2
@entity65 , of the @entity66 , told @entity67 : ' it is a truly horrific problem we have			0
the government says obesity is falling in children , which it might be in affluent areas			0
denial : experts say many parents believe nothing needs to be done about their overweight children - because they ' look healthy and happy ' ' but in many cases , it 's about volume - fat people are getting fatter			1
also , many parents do n't realise their child is overweight - quite often because they are fat themselves			1
' it is horrific figures such as these which show just how big the problem of childhood obesity is becoming			2
' @entity90 , public health consultant for @entity32 , said the main challenge is changing the attitudes of parents with overweight children who believe nothing needs to be done because theirchild looks healthy and happy			1
a recent survey suggests most parents ignore advice offered by the @entity53			0
she added : ' we ’ve become accustomed to the overweight because it ’s so common in our society			0
' we are not recognising it when we see it because people only hear about the extreme cases , people think it ’s an extreme state			0
' the 19 - and - a - half stone child is not the problem , although it ’s a problem for them			0
' the problem is the [ other ] children ... who are either overweight or very overweight			2
worry : millions of schoolchildren will grow to become obese adults , increasing their risk of diabetes , heart attacks , strokes , cancer and other killer diseases ' but we should n’t focus on weight , we should focus on the behaviours , their eating and the activity			2
' if we did this healthy weights will naturally follow			0
' a spokesman at @entity132 said : ' children identified as overweight or obese through the programme are pro-actively offered weight management support			1
' there are protocols in place to ensure that the family / carer receive an individual child ’s results within three weeks of being weighed and measured			0
' up to three weeks after this , the school health team ’s @entity143 will telephone the family and offer weight management support			0
' if calls are not returned , the school health team will follow up in writing , but it is ultimately the family ’s decision whether to take up the offer of help or not			0
if any safeguarding issues are considered , a referral to @entity157 may be made			0
