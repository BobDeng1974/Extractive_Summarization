by virtue of the fact he arrived at the club costing the square root of zero , @entity0 gains an exemption from the debate over @entity8 ’s greatest pound - for - pound signing on a technicality			1
were the issue to be widened to simply the best bargain the club has ever landed , however , there is no question the 31 - year - old ’s name is fast approaching being used in the same breath as the likes of £ 650,000 @entity18 and £ 900,000 @entity19			1
there ’s a clear distinction to be made between the backdrop to @entity0 ’s arrival and that of those heroes of yesteryear			1
@entity18 may have been unhappy and under - utilised while at @entity27 but he had had no serious injuries at that stage			1
likewise @entity30 ’s emerging @entity32 powerhouse			2
@entity0 ( right ) returned to playing with @entity8 this summer after two years out of the game with injury the former @entity36 stopper was released by @entity36 and suffered career - threatening knee injuries by contrast , @entity0 had n’t played a competitive game in two years			1
the toll of a broken arm and a knee injury sustained while at @entity36 cast a shadow – and many a question mark – over his suitability			1
for those critics of a transfer policy that was obviously ushering @entity50 to the exit door , the acquisition of a free - agent like @entity0 seemed further evidence of downsizing			1
how wrong they have been			2
in the aftermath of a flawless display against @entity57 on thursday , @entity0 ’s contribution was underscored by the embraces of his grateful team - mates			1
the @entity61 , as the @entity60 called the mighty @entity50 , may now be stationed on the @entity62 but @entity0 already appears to be an equally formidable barrier			1
so much for the old wisdom about getting nothing for free in this life			1
‘ i just keep trying to improve , ’ he reflected			1
‘ i ’ll do that regardless of whether i ’m playing well or poorly			0
@entity0 ( centre ) pulled off wonderful save after wonderful save against @entity57 on thursday ‘ i always want to improve my game			1
there have been a few difficult games especially in @entity72 where i ’ve had to produce a few saves but that ’s what i ’m there for			0
‘ i ’m feeling more comfortable every week			1
it ’s small things like decision - making – when to come out and when to stay in – that can be more difficult sometimes than making instinctive saves			0
‘ it ’s those small things in the game that people maybe do n’t realise			2
they are the last things to come back when you ’ve been out for so long			2
‘ judging the flight of cross balls , balls over the top of the defence – when to come out and when to stay , just getting your angles right for shots from different places on the park , and just really knowing where the goal is behind you			0
‘ these are just little things that come with playing the position and getting games under my belt			0
’ as @entity57 found to their cost , @entity0 ’s shot - stopping powers appear to be returning to the level that persuaded @entity36 to make him @entity107 ’s most expensive goalkeeper at £ 9million seven years ago			1
the former £ 9million @entity107 record goalkeeper rushes out to punch the ball clear against @entity57 time and again the @entity110 asked questions of the giant figure clad in green but by the end of the night his heroics had demoralised them			1
@entity115 , their @entity116 winger , spurned five opportunities and will be seeing @entity0 in his nightmares for some time to come			1
but if the keeper never doubted that he still had nuts and bolts in his toolbag to do the physical side of the job , he admitted he harboured concerns as to how he ’d handle the mental side of returning after such a lengthy hiatus			0
‘ i honestly never thought it was there			2
but perhaps subconsciously , without really thinking about it , i had to cross a bridge psychologically , ’ he added			0
‘ i was nervous when i first played again as i was concerned with how things would go			0
i still get nervous before every match but that ’s getting less with every game i play now			2
‘ i ’m just going out there and training as much as i can to try and improve			2
’ little wonder @entity138 and his players spent the aftermath of the game praising their no 1 to the high heavens			2
the history books will show that @entity146 ’ sweet early strike was the difference between the teams but even the goal - scorer was anxious that the real accolades went to the man between the sticks			0
@entity0 dives to his right and sticks out a strong arm to deny @entity115 from scoring on thursday coupled with a fine opening draw in @entity157 , @entity138 ’s men now have something tangible to build on			1
no matter that the season so far has felt stop - start in nature , four - points gained from sides of considerable calibre nods towards progress being made			0
‘ after the disappointment of going out of the @entity169 , this has turned out to be another really difficult group with some real quality teams in it , ’ @entity0 continued			1
‘ i do n’t think the teams we ’ve played so far would be at all out of place in the @entity169			0
‘ in fact , the boys were saying in there that the past two games we ’ve played in this competition were maybe of a higher standard than the games we played to try and qualify for the @entity169			0
‘ so it ’s good teams we are playing against			0
there are no poor teams at this stage			0
they ’re of a standard where it ’s still extremely hard to get points on the board			0
‘ it ’s a great result and one which puts is in a very strong position now			0
‘ we feel in the games coming up ( against @entity197 ) we can get six points to get to the 10 point mark and that would give us a great chance of going through			0
the @entity203 international is adamant that @entity8 must continue their positive form in the @entity205 ‘ we ’ve made a really good start but we ’re taking nothing for granted			1
‘ we know we ’ve got to go on and pick up a few more wins to make sure we get out of the group which would be a fine achievement			0
’ having done the hard part , @entity0 stressed how imperative it is that a promising start to the group is n’t undone in the double - header against the outsiders from @entity216			1
‘ something we have to be careful of is being caught on the counter-attack at home			0
you saw tonight that we let that happen , ’ he went on			0
‘ we ca n’t take anything for granted from the two games that are coming up			0
‘ it ’s easy to go into a game against a so - called lesser team only to lose the first goal			2
at this level it ’s always hard to get back and then win the game			1
‘ we have to do what we do best and try to come out on top			0
@entity8 and @entity0 will be looking to make it four wins in a row against @entity236 in the league on sunday ‘ if we were to get through this group it would give us something special to look forward to in the second half of the season but that ’s a long way away yet			1
’ for the first time since @entity138 arrived at @entity245 , his side have strung together three successive wins			2
look closely enough and there might even be a hint of a feel - good factor emerging			0
for the momentum to build and for the many floating voters on the new regime to be won over though , victory against @entity236 on sunday is mandatory			1
‘ they ’ve been doing brilliant and have been playing some really good stuff , ’ @entity0 offered			1
‘ we ’re under no illusions that ’s it ’s going to be a difficult game			2
they are up there on merit by playing some great football			0
‘ it ’s will be a difficult game for us but it ’s one we are desperate to win so we go into the international break in a better position .			2
