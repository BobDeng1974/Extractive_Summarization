@entity0 may be to blame for the four - car crash that left one person dead and seven injured , according to sources who said that the pattern of damage on the car he rear - ended suggested that impact was the very first in the sequence			1
former @entity10 , 65 , smashed his @entity11 into the back of the victim 's white @entity13 on the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , on saturday			1
according to previous reports , the @entity13 had been in @entity20 's path after coming to a halt when it hit a prius travelling ahead			1
the @entity13 was then pushed into the path of a @entity25 coming the other way , leaving the vehicle a crumpled wreck and the sole occupant , 69 - year - old @entity29 , dead			1
investigators are now trying to determine the cause and circumstances surrounding the crash and plan to look at the cellphone records of all four drivers and check for any video evidence now , sources have told @entity33 that , rather than the chain reaction being caused by the victim 's @entity13 hitting the @entity31 in front of her , @entity20 may have hit both cars			1
they claimed that because the @entity13 had been travelling in a straight line before being rear - ended by @entity74 , if the @entity13 had first struck the @entity31 , there would have been the same amount of damage to the left and right sides of the front of the @entity13 before he hit it - but pictures of the incident suggest there is not			1
a representative for the @entity31 also driver told @entity33 that there is an imprint of @entity20 's license plate in the car			1
law enforcement sources told the celebrity news site that one operating theory is that the @entity31 had been stopped behind cars and , as a traffic light turned green , vehicles began moving			2
it was at this point , sources say , that @entity20 rear - ended the @entity13 and when the @entity13 cleared his lane , his car kept moving and crashed into the @entity31			1
@entity33 reported that police say when @entity20 hit the @entity13 , it veered left while his @entity11 moved to the right			2
the woman who died in the four - car crash was 69 - year - old widow @entity29 , a neighbour of the @entity106 @entity0 was pictured holding a cigarette out the window of his @entity11 before the crash here , a zoomed - out version of the image shows @entity20 's suv before it sustained dents to the bonnet detectives in @entity16 have opened a vehicular homicide investigation			1
if any of the drivers in the crash are found criminally negligent , felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison			0
if it is determined that @entity20 's @entity11 struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely , it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely than if he was just part of the chain reaction			2
@entity20 , who was involved in the fatal crash on saturday , is seen taking a sobriety test in front of officers @entity20 co-operated with officers , walking in a straight line at their instruction			2
he passed the test the @entity52 family patriarch was towing a dune buggy at the time of the crash , pictured right investigations will determine if @entity20 , or any of the other three drivers involved in the collision , were texting or on their mobile phones at the time of the collision			0
it is illegal to text while driving in @entity17			0
the star 's representative has denied that he was texting behind the wheel			0
breaking his silence on the crash the following day , @entity20 said in a statement : ' my heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones , and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident			0
' ' it is a devastating tragedy , and i can not pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time			0
i am praying for them			0
i will continue to cooperate in every way possible			0
' but three days after the crash , @entity20 was seen talking on his phone while driving in @entity170			2
the reality star had the device pressed to his ear while behind the wheel in @entity175 , @entity17			0
@entity20 's @entity11 hit the back of the victim 's white @entity13 on the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , which then reportedly hit a @entity31 before being pushed into the path of a @entity25 the @entity15 was shut down as detectives opened a vehicular homicide investigation if it is determined that @entity20 's @entity11 struck both cars and authorities find he was following too closely , it would make prosecution for vehicular manslaughter more likely an aerial view of the crash scene on saturday shows the damaged cars , and police markings as they work to establish the cause @entity0 , pictured above with his olympic gold medal for the decathlon in the 1976 @entity195 games @entity0 married @entity196 , pictured together , in 1991 , but their divorce is expected to be finalized next month @entity0 ( back center ) is ex-husband of @entity196 ( back row with @entity0 ) and father to @entity200 and @entity201 ( right of @entity196 )			1

@entity20 , 65 , smashed his @entity11 into the back of victim 's @entity13
previous theory suggested @entity20 had been unable to avoid @entity13 after it ran into back of @entity31 travelling ahead
but sources suggest @entity20 's car may have struck the @entity13 first , before driving on and hitting the @entity31
pictures of incident suggest lack of damage to @entity13 that would be expected if it had rear - ended another car , sources claim
