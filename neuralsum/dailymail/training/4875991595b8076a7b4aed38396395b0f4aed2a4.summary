@entity1 manager @entity0 feels @entity2 are no worse offenders than any other side when it comes to diving			1
a number of incidents from last weekend 's @entity10 fixtures brought the topic of simulation back to the fore once again			1
and three of those involved @entity2 players going to ground in their 2 - 0 home win over @entity17 , with @entity18 and @entity19 being booked for diving either side of @entity22 apparently throwing himself to the turf but going unpunished			1
@entity2 centre back @entity22 ( centre ) was not booked for this dive against @entity17 last saturday @entity26 was furious that @entity22 was not punished for an apparent dive against his side last weekend @entity29 boss @entity26 described the @entity22 incident as being ' like something out of @entity32 '			1
but when @entity0 , whose 12th - placed team are table - topping @entity2 's next league opponents , was asked ahead of that meeting if he thought the @entity36 were particularly guilty of diving , he said : ' no - they are no worse than anyone else in my view			1
' speaking at his press conference ahead of monday 's clash at the @entity45 , @entity42 striker @entity0 admitted referees currently have a tough task on their hands trying to distinguish between incidents where a ' soft ' foul has been committed and where there has been no contact , with a player going down deliberately			1
at the same time , though , the @entity54 - who in october defended @entity55 , the winger on loan at @entity1 from @entity2 , amid accusations he dived in a victory over @entity59 - does not regard simulation as ' a problem right through the game '			2
@entity0 said of the diving debate sparked by last weekend 's incidents : ' there is a focus almost every week , and more often than not it changes from one week to the next			1
@entity1 manager @entity0 says @entity2 are no worse offenders of diving than any other side ahead ' an incident in a game will be highlighted and people will surmise there is a problem right through the game , but i do n't think that is the case			1
' i think there will always be players maybe anticipating tackles coming in , and when a defender does n't , then that can lead to embarrassing situations for the people involved because it looks like they are trying to gain an advantage			2
' it is important that if somebody is fouled , the right decision is made , even if it is a soft foul - a correct decision is a foul , or a penalty			0
that is not simulation in my view			0
' so it is about getting the right decisions from referees , although it is not easy for them to deal with			0
' i think more and more these days there is more skill in it , with players prepared to go down to gain an advantage even when there has been absolutely no contact whatsoever - that is incorrect , and should not happen			0
' there is a grey area in terms of players having contact and players just going down without any , so that is what needs stamping out			0
' @entity118 ( right ) with @entity120 boss @entity0 says he wants to stay at the club for the rest of his career meanwhile , @entity120 midfielder @entity118 has indicated he wants to stay with @entity1 for the rest of his career			1
@entity118 , with the club since 2008 , is out of contract next summer and @entity0 said on thursday that an offer of a new deal has been made to the @entity128 international which he is yet to respond to			1
quoted by @entity130 on friday , @entity118 , who last started a @entity1 game in early october , said : ' i will be just keeping my head down and working as hard as i can to get back in the team , and see where it takes me			2
' that has done all right for me since i 've been at @entity1 so i 'm sure i 'll be okay come the end of the season			2
' i would definitely like to stay			2
i have always enjoyed coming in for training and pulling on the red and white jersey			0
that 's no different now			0
' it 's difficult because i 'm not in the team at the moment			0
i have n't actually sat down with the manager or anyone on the board , so where the stories have come from of late i 'm not sure			0
they have n't come from me			0
' if we can get something sorted out , it 's not me wanting to leave			0
for as long as i still have a chance of playing i 'll be doing all i can to spend the rest of my career here			2

diving has again been a topic of debate in the @entity10 recently
@entity17 boss @entity26 described @entity2 defender @entity22 's *tumble* in the *box* against his side as ' something out of @entity32 '
however , @entity1 boss and former @entity36 forward @entity0 believes @entity171 's @entity2 side are no worse offenders than any other side
@entity1 face @entity2 on monday night at the @entity45
@entity118 says he wants to stay at the club for the rest of his career
