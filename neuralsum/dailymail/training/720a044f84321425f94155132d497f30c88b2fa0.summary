by @entity0 published : 04:16 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 04:20 est , 29 may 2013 even day - to - day tasks like dealing with bills causes a fifth of @entity4 to feel anxious and unconfident in a disturbing glimpse of the country ’s mood , it seems a quarter of @entity10 never feel good about themselves and are riddled by insecurities			1
new research reveals that the country seriously lacks confidence with our appearance , our ability to parent , and basic tasks like paying bills correctly all causing us anxiety			2
a survey of 2,033 respondents revealed that for over a quarter , facing themselves in the mirror ranked highest in terms of situations where confidence escaped them , with 33 per cent saying their body is the thing they would most like to change to improve their self - assurance			1
other things that left @entity10 insecure were dealing with bank or utility companies , which left nearly one fifth of adults feeling unconfident , and taking children to the local swimming pool at the weekends ( 30 per cent )			2
the research also showed that while women battled with confidence more than men ( with 10 per cent of more women admitting to never feeling good about themselves , and 15 per cent more with little or no confidence ) there is one situation that turns both sexes into nervous wrecks - parental insecurities			1
a similar number of men and women ( 21 per cent ) face similar concerns when it comes to measuring up against other parents at the school gate and at children 's ’ parties			0
although those with children fared better than childless respondents in terms of feeling good , it was an even playing field when it came to confidence with virtually the same amount admitting to having little or no confidence – in fact , a worrying 35 per cent of parents felt they had none to pass on to their children			0
the research supports the old adage that we get more confident with age , with those respondents in the 55 - and - upwards age bracket citing the here and now as the time they felt their best			0
regional differences in confidence were also revealed by the survey , which casts doubt over the perceived self - assurance of the @entity88			1
despite living in a city renowned for its party atmosphere , results have shown that the ‘ @entity98 ’ may be all for show , with @entity93 having the highest percentage of those who never feel good at 30.8 per cent , closely followed by their @entity96 neighbours , @entity97 at 26.8 per cent			2
insecurities over parenting abilities is one of the greatest causes of lack of confidence for both men and women with children , though overall they are more confident than childless couples the ‘ @entity115 ’ must count for something though , with @entity110 and @entity111 ranking low in terms of respondents , with only 12.8 per cent claiming they never feel good			1
a spokesman for the @entity117 who conducted the study commented on the findings , saying : ‘ the research commissioned has thrown up some pretty shocking statistics with regards to just how low some of us are feeling on a daily basis , and how little confidence we have			0
‘ most startling is how a lack of confidence can result in a total inability to complete simple tasks , and undertake every day activities			0
sadder still , is the high percentage of respondents who find looking at themselves in the mirror as the biggest blow to confidence			0
