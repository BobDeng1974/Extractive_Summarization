@entity0 and his seven - year - old brother @entity13 first hit the headlines when videos showing their intense training regime went viral in 2010			1
the tiny muscle ' men ' have been performing amazing acrobatic feats and lifting weights since they were toddlers			0
his parents have denied forcing him to train for hours and mother @entity47 said of her sons : ' they have a natural ability for this , nothing is forced , it is what @entity52 intended for them ' but the shocking latest photos - posted by their dad @entity54 - showing @entity0 balancing on two bottles using only his hands have been criticised as extremely dangerous			1
the youngster is precariously balanced , and the pictures show that he could easily slip on the bottles which could smash and cause massive injury to his hands and face when he came crashing down			0
one user wrote : ' and what if the bottle cracks ? what chance is there that he would n't get a serious injury on the way down ? ' a @entity70 user called @entity71 wrote , ' this is idiotic , what if the bottle breaks ' , while another user called @entity76 wrote : ' you are destroying his body ! please , it 's not ok for the kid			0
' on previous videos posted by the father , other uses have accused him of ' child abuse ' but the criticism has been ignored by the family , and it is not the first time that the boy has been shown doing risky exercises			2
in a video posted recently , @entity0 is seen performing 25 push - ups on his hands on a horizontal bar and with his head down			2
his younger brother @entity96 does the same exercise , but only manages to make 12 push - ups			0
balance : the youngster is capable of extreme shows of strength and performs push ups while balanced on two glass bottles , which prompted criticism on social media dangerous : @entity0 performs push ups on the bottles , causing one social media user to comment : ' this is idiotic , what if the bottle breaks ' @entity0 has already broken two world records for 90 - degree vertical push - ups and another for holding on to a pole like a human flag			1
@entity13 soon followed suit , starting at the age of 18 months , and is already performing handstand push - ups on a bar and learning the same terrifying flag trick			0
father @entity54 , 38 , was determined to make them famous and put them through a gruelling two hour regime each morning in @entity124 , in central @entity125 , where his family lived			2
his plans went awry and he was forced back to @entity34 , where he has now makes a living selling scrap metal and trading in the southern village of @entity132			0

the boys are clearly capable of extraordinary feats , but it has been suggested that it is cruel to expect children of their age to train so hard			0
