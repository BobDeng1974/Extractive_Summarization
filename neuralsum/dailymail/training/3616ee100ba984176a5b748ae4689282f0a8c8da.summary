' ' mrs @entity9 ’s death was contributed to by neglect			2

mrs @entity9 's husband , sergeant major @entity41 , of @entity13 ’s 7th @entity42 , @entity43 , told police : ' no one knew what the hell was going on			1
' mrs @entity9 , a police constable based near to her home in @entity13 , @entity14 , had successfully given birth to her baby daughter by ventouse at 8.20pm on 18 september 2011 following a failed forceps delivery			2
but problems arose soon after as staff noted pc @entity9 was suffering ‘ torrential bleeding ’ in the aftermath of the birth			2
estimates made at the time placed the bleeding at around 2.4 litres , while the real figure was more than double that , the inquest into mrs @entity9 's death heard			1
@entity13 : the coroner accused staff there of ' very serious failings ' in the care given to mrs @entity9 @entity69 was pronounced dead at 11.57pm with a post-mortem giving the cause of death as a massive haemorrhage which triggered cardiac arrest			1
the three - day inquest , held at @entity76 , heard damning evidence from staff who admitted failing to replace lost blood			0
dr @entity80 , consultant anaesthetist on the night , admitted to the court : ' i would feel much more comfortable if i had given more blood			0
' @entity13 released a statement apologising to the family , saying : ' unfortunately , a massive haemorrhage can occasionally occur during natural childbirth and we deeply regret that mrs @entity9 was not given the highest quality of care			1
' ' my family has been devastated by the errors made by the hospital which has taken a wonderful mother and wife away from us			0
' - sgt major @entity41 , widower the statement said a raft of improvements had been implemented at the hospital but added : ' nothing can now change the tragic events of september 2011			0
' the damning case comes just months after an inquest into the death of baby @entity107 at the same hospital in april 2012 - staff were criticised for using ‘ poor technique or excessive force ’ with forceps , resulting in a fatal fracture to the child ’s skull			0
after the inquest into mrs @entity9 's death , her widower spoke of his ' devastation ' at his wife 's death			1
sgt @entity123 , whose daughter survived the birth , said : ' my family has been devastated by the errors made by the hospital which has taken a wonderful mother and wife away from us			2
' i had many unanswered questions before the inquest and i am pleased that the coroner has carried out such a thorough review			0
' she identified a succession of very serious failings in @entity9 's care but my family will now have to deal with the consequences			0
' i can only hope that the hospital learns from its mistakes so that the same does not happen to someone else			0
' @entity144 , clinical negligence lawyer with @entity146 , said : ' it is difficult to understand why anaesthetists failed to respond to mrs @entity9 's very extensive blood loss and to give her adequate replacement fluids			2
' it seems clear that with adequate management she would not have died and proper care would have avoided such a catastrophic loss to her family			0
