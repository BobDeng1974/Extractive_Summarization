by @entity0 published : 23:59 est , 31 july 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 1 august 2013 the hot weather has been blamed for a host of travel problems - from tarmac melting , to train tracks buckling			1
but now it would appear that @entity8 's heatwave has caused planes to become ' too heavy ' to take off			0
safety concerns about the plane taking off has led to passengers being blocked from boarding their plane , and in some cases passengers are being forced to disembark to lighten the load			0
@entity17 is allegedly suffering more than others because it has a smaller runway , and in hot weather planes need more time to take off passengers were removed from a @entity24 flight between @entity17 and @entity25 on sunday , the @entity21 reported			1
the airport is allegedly suffering more than others because it has a smaller runway , and in the hot weather planes need a longer amount of time to take off			1
because warm air is less dense than cold air , subsequently there are fewer air molecules in a given volume of warm air than in the same volume of cooler air			0
as temperature and humidity rises , the air becomes less dense , and therefore the air creates less lift for the airplane			0
as temperature and humidity rises , the air becomes less dense , and therefore the air creates less lift for the airplane ' as a result , on a hot day , an airplane will require more runway to take off , will have a poor rate of climb and a faster approach and will experience a longer landing roll , ' pilot friend explained			1
on sunday , 15 passengers were asked to disembark a @entity60 flight out of @entity17 because the plane was too heavy to take off , @entity57 reported			1
' due to weather conditions , the take - off weight of the aircraft had to be reduced due to safety reasons , ' a spokesman for @entity24 told the @entity21			0
' in very high temperatures it usually takes longer until the aircraft can actually take - off , and since @entity17 has a short airstrip the take - off weight needed to be reduced , ' they said			2
however , a spokesman for the airport said that the heat had not caused any airplanes to be grounded , and suggested that the plane was overweight			0
a spokesman for @entity17 said : ' @entity17 is a @entity79 ( short take off and landing ) but very little stops the planes that are certified to fly in and out of here doing so - and hot weather is n't one of those factors			1
' sounds like the plane was overweight , pure and simple - something that happens to all planes at all airports regardless of runway size			2
' larger airports , like @entity91 and @entity92 , have far longer runways , giving the planes the time and length they need to safely take off			2
the hot weather which has grounded planes shows no sign of abating			1
this month has been the hottest and driest july on record since 2006 , forecasters have confirmed.and while the prolonged hot spell will continue to peter out as temperatures slump to normal levels , the @entity8 can look forward to one more scorcher with the mercury set to soar to @entity108			0
temperatures could even top that level in the south - making it the hottest august day in a decade .			0
