by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor labour grandees were accused of showing contempt for the public last night after they dismissed calls for an @entity7 referendum			1
arch - @entity8 , some in the pay of @entity11 , rejected calls for a vote as the @entity14 debated plans to enshrine in law @entity17 ’s pledge to hold a referendum in 2017			1
former @entity21 commissioner @entity20 , who will get a lucrative pension from @entity11 at 65 , said politicians should not entrust the public with an in - out vote on the @entity7 as the outcome would be a lottery			1
@entity20 , @entity28 's former business secretary , said @entity30 s @entity7 membership is ' absolutely fundamental ' and must not be put ' in the hands ' of an unpredictable referendum @entity33 , whose family is reported to have received £ 10million in pay , perks and pension entitlements while he and his wife @entity38 worked in @entity11 , attacked the plans as an appeasement to @entity41			1
they spoke in a seven - hour @entity43 on a @entity44 , introduced by @entity46 mp @entity45 , which sailed through the @entity48 after @entity49 and @entity50 declined to block it			1
but @entity28 and @entity53 peers yesterday launched a coordinated assault			1
the @entity55 passed its second reading without a vote – the convention in the @entity14 – but critics are now expected to table hundreds of amendments in a bid to derail it			1
the @entity64 was introduced into the @entity65 , who said : ‘ nobody below the age of 60 has ever had a chance to have a say on this issue			1
this @entity64 is needed and it is very much wanted			1
‘ a referendum is about democracy			2
it is not about being in @entity21 , it about allowing people to decide their own future			2
it would be a brave man who denies them that choice – and an even braver unelected peer			0
’ @entity83 , pictured with @entity84 and @entity85 , is missing the @entity86 for the debate @entity88 creator @entity83 missed the @entity86 to battle for an @entity7 referendum			1
the best - selling author of the acclaimed political thriller is leading piloting the @entity7 referendum @entity64 through the @entity14			1
the trilogy @entity88 featured scheming chief whip @entity93 plotting the downfall of his rivals in the @entity48 to become prime minister			0
it became a hit miniseries for the @entity99 in 1990s and last year was remade by the @entity100 with @entity84 playing central character , @entity103 @entity102			0
the series won three emmys and this weekend is nominated for four @entity86 including best tv series			0
however , @entity83 will not be in @entity107 for sunday 's ceremony , because today 's @entity7 debate did not give him time to travel			1
ahead of the debate he said : ' i 'm about to make the biggest speech of my life ( or at least since the one i made proposing to my wife )			0
' i am the sponsor of the @entity117 that is designed to give everyone a vote on our membership of the @entity7 at some point in 2017			1
it 's time for the people to decide			2
' but @entity20 told the @entity99 : ‘ membership of the @entity7 is absolutely fundamental to @entity128 interests and therefore we should be very wary about putting our interests in the hands of a lottery			1
’ in the @entity14 , he said mr @entity17 had been ‘ taken hostage by the militant tendency ’ of the @entity46 party			1
when he left @entity11 , @entity20 received £ 234,000 ‘ top - up ’ salary payments and a £ 15,000 resettlement fee			2
under the terms of his pension he has to continue to show a ‘ duty of loyalty to the @entity142 ’			0
the @entity99 was accused of ‘ unbelievable bias ’ over @entity21 yesterday after a presenter branded a referendum a ‘ charade ’ and suggested it would be ‘ stupid ’ to give the public a say			1
radio 4 broadcaster @entity149 was accused of repeatedly interrupting @entity46 lord @entity83 on the today show but let @entity28 ’s @entity20 twice speak for almost two minutes			1
mr @entity149 also predicted a @entity28 victory in 2015 that made a @entity64 over the referendum pointless			1
@entity153 complained , but the @entity99 last night said it was ‘ satisfied ’ its coverage was fair and balanced			0
@entity155 , @entity46 mp for @entity156 , said : ‘ @entity20 thinks that the @entity128 people ca n’t be trusted			1
he believes the @entity21 political elites know best			0
’ former mandarins and pro-eu politicians condemned the @entity161			0
@entity33 said that , when elected @entity46 leader , mr @entity17 had pleaded with his party to stop ‘ banging on ’ about @entity21			1
‘ mr @entity17 ’s appeal to stop the “ banging on ” has been greeted daily by the war drums of the unyielding @entity165 inside , and @entity166 outside , his party , and to the detriment of our country , he has pranced to their rhythm , ’ @entity33 said			0
but former @entity28 foreign secretary @entity173 , who now sits as a crossbencher , said that while the @entity64 was a gimmick it was essential to placate the public			1
and former @entity177 and @entity178 said @entity128 ’s future did not lie in the @entity7			1
the @entity64 must still go through committee , report and third reading stages in the @entity14 before returning to the @entity48			1
because it is a @entity44 , it can be heard only during friday sessions – the last of which in the @entity48 in this parliamentary session is february 28 – but senior @entity46 sources say they will not let it be killed off			1
gosh , the @entity187 were worried			0
they had been asked to look at a @entity190 for a referendum on the @entity7			1
on a friday ! what a blazing affront			0
fridays are for doing the crossword at home			0
fridays are for martinis before lunch , canasta and filling in one ’s parliamentary expenses claims			0
they certainly are n’t for discussing our possible departure from the greatest gravy boat of all time , the ultimate bateau de jus , le grand paquebot de sauce bearnaise , the @entity7			1
@entity17 has ordered all conservative mps to back legislation paving the way for a referendum on @entity128 's membership of the @entity7 to take place by the end of 2017 these @entity217 lordships considered the @entity55 both tyrannous and trifling			1
it was dangerous but it was also ‘ otiose ’			0
is n’t it a beaut ’ ? it means ‘ functionless , futile , superfluous ’			0
so why do they complain about it ? if something is truly otiose , it can be ignored			0
the foot - stamping protestations of a railway passenger left on the platform as the train pulls out of the station are otiose			2
yet the @entity187 were not ignoring this @entity64			2
ooooh no. queued up , they did , the former @entity235 grandees , the failed mps , the onetime @entity236 and @entity238 officials and quangoland worthies who nowadays fill the increasingly rotten @entity240 , to moan like the @entity242 chorus in an amateur production of @entity244			0
worried about the hoi polloi ? @entity20 was one of those leading the way against a referendum ‘ @entity249 , ’ said @entity251 - flavoured @entity250 ( con )			2
‘ @entity249 ’ said @entity252 ( @entity53 )			2
@entity253 of @entity254 , the @entity255 mp who defected to @entity257 ’s government ( was a peerage part of the deal ? ) used words such as ‘ squalid ’ and ‘ scandalous ’			0
lord @entity262 , once a grand fromage of the @entity238 , was a living bifurcation of ennui and vexation , disdain and dismay brought together in the same vinaigrette bottle and given a brisk shaking			0
it did not help that someone had forgotten to put old @entity262 on the list of peers to speak			0
there was apparently much behind - the - scenes harrumphing			2
then someone noticed that @entity278 ’s name had been included by mistake , so maybe one of the clerks misread @entity262 ’s handwriting and put down @entity278 instead			0
lord @entity262 , who wasted a quarter of an hour at the start on a silly ( i nearly said otiose ) procedural point , complained that the @entity14 was being asked to rush the @entity64			1
this was a line of argument used by other @entity8			0
that absurd and actually unpleasant man @entity291 ( @entity292 lookalike ) gave a warning that he had cleared all his coming fridays			0
this was a coded way of saying that he may try to talk out the @entity64			2
lord @entity297 ( @entity298 ) , making his first speech since stepping down as @entity300 , said it would be a truly bad idea for an unelected @entity14 to try to prevent the people of @entity128 having a vote on @entity21			1
lord @entity305 ( @entity306 ) , one of those who promised to subject the @entity64 to as much scrutiny as he could manage , said ‘ i am as passionately pro-european as i am committed to @entity310 ’			2
given that @entity305 is reputed to sleep in a pair of pyjamas printed with the red dragon , and that his home ’s loo chain may well ring ‘ @entity317 ’ every time it is yanked , this was quite a declaration			0
defence : lord @entity297 , pictured , said the people should n't be denied a referendum - and was ignored the @entity64 was put by its proposer , @entity83 ( @entity298 ) , author of @entity88			1
@entity28 ’s opposition was led by @entity324 , whose wife used to be no 3 at the @entity99 ( she left with a stonking payout )			2
@entity324 was onetime @entity11 bag carrier to @entity20			0
@entity20 himself spoke , as did @entity33 , another @entity329			0
what an acidic speech he gave , attacking eurosceptics as ‘ europhobes ’			0
did we hear these @entity11 pensioners declare their continuing financial interests ? we did not			0
the best speech was from former foreign secretary @entity173 ( @entity338 ) , who said that a referendum was now the ‘ settled will ’ of the people			2
but it is not the settled will of former @entity235 wallahs such as @entity344 , who wanted foreigners in @entity128 to be given a vote in the referendum			2
eh ? the drawling , patronising @entity8 intend to fight and fight dirty			0
they hate the idea of giving hoi polloi their say			0
they may well block this @entity64			2
but their stubbornness will only help @entity17 delineate positions and will only increase public anger with the @entity7 – and this @entity14			1
i started watching the debate uncertain how i might vote in a referendum			2
the more i listened to these imperious @entity8 , the more i leaned towards the exit .			0

@entity28 grandee warns @entity7 membership must not be ' in the hands ' of voters
*ex-business* secretary says @entity49 must not promise a referendum
@entity46 - backed @entity64 clears its first *hurdle* in the @entity14
@entity28 and @entity53 expected to attempt to unite to kill it off later
@entity374 's @entity149 suggests @entity28 would be ' stupid ' to back in - out vote
