the @entity1 's shopping spree is set to continue today as experts predict cyber monday will see consumers spend another £ 650 million online within 24 hours			1
following the chaos and flashes of violence that marred @entity8 , today 's event is based around online purchases although many stores are still offering bargains			1
internet shopping figures consistently peak on the first monday in december , thought to be a combination of the last payday before @entity16 falling on the previous friday and a weekend spent browsing the shops before buying from home			1
below are the best deals according to @entity21 's experts : 1			1
is the @entity22 ? it should include the retailer ’s name , address and email address			2
check for a tiny padlock or unbroken key symbol before the web address , and be sure the address begins with https : / / ( the ‘ s ’ is for ‘ secure ’ )			2
genuine firms wo n’t feature the names of popular items or cheap prices in their web address			2
@entity39 if you ’ve spotted a gift from a relatively unknown company , @entity43 it and see what comes up			2
when browsing for goods , do n’t be fooled by a site ranked highly in search results			2
@entity49 for goods costing £ 100 - plus , a credit card gives more protection than a debit card , prepaid card or @entity55			1
if an order goes astray , the goods break or the firm goes bust , you can claim from the card provider			0
never pay by cash transfer			0
@entity63 £ 50 on anti-virus protection from ‘ phishing ’ emails to spyware , fraudsters are adept at hacking online accounts , so get an up - to - date firewall from the likes of @entity72 or @entity73 for £ 20 to £ 50			1
@entity74 should not be too personal avoid obvious names or dates , and try not to use the same password for all sites			0
to create a complex password , use a mnemonic : for example , pick a song , the year it came out , and stick a £ sign at the end			1
you can vary it for different websites by adding the first two letters of the site you ’re visiting			0
@entity92 @entity91 turn off a pc if you ’re not using it , especially after a browsing session ( a favourite time for hackers )			0
if a site offers you a choice of storing your payment details or making a one - off purchase , go for the latter			0
@entity105 ’s @entity104 if you ’re buying gifts and using your smartphone , do it on the retailer ’s app rather than using the main website			0
a dedicated app , if available , offers greater software protection than a web browser , especially if you ’re in a public place			0
if you ’re still nervous choose websites that allow you to order online but pay only when you pick up the goods in person			1
@entity120 names including @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 now offer this .			0

@entity1 consumers are *expected* to spend £ *600million* in 24 hours on what could be come *busiest* online shopping day '
