by @entity0 a new treatment could bring hope to thousands of shingles sufferers with long - term pain			1
trials of the experimental drug @entity6 found it cut pain levels by at least 30 per cent for more than half of sufferers - some of whom had been in agony for years			1
pain relief was experienced after just four weeks of taking two pills a day , according to a study published in @entity18 medical journal			1
a bout of shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later , a study shows @entity27 researchers behind the study hope the breakthrough will benefit patients with post-shingles pain , and many more with other intractable pain conditions			1
because the drug works in a different way to conventional painkillers , it may be able to treat chronic nerve pain from diabetes , @entity40 , nerve injury and cancer chemotherapy			2
shingles is caused by reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox and affects 190,000 @entity27 each year , most of them aged over 50			1
after a case of chickenpox the virus is not eliminated but retreats to clusters of sensory nerve cells , usually near the spinal cord , where it remains in a dormant state			2
but , as immunity weakens with age or as a result of stress , the virus can reactivate , leading to a painful rash			2
for one in 10 patients , the permanent nerve damage caused by the virus results in post-herpetic neuralgia ( @entity64 ) , the medical term for post-shingles pain			1
this can be severely debilitating , causing burning , throbbing and stabbing pain which is difficult to treat			2
pain relief was experienced after just four weeks of taking two pills a day , according to a study conventional painkilling agents often fail to work , and can have unpleasant or disabling side effects			1
the study involved 183 patients aged 22 - 89 years in six countries who had had @entity64 for at least six months			2
the study compared @entity77 with a placebo or dummy treatment , with participants taking two pills a day for four weeks			1
altogether 58 per cent of participants taking the drug found it effective , reducing pain by at least 30 per cent by blocking pain pathways in a novel way			1
it did not cause any serious side effects			0
study leader professor @entity89 , from the @entity90 at @entity91 , said ‘ conventional painkillers do n’t tend to help people with severe chronic neuropathic pain and most available treatments have modest efficacy and / or are limited by side effects			0
‘ we are therefore keen to find new ways of providing these people with some relief			0
‘ a positive trial like this in such a challenging condition as post-herpetic neuralgia , for a drug that acts in a new way , is unusual and very exciting			0
‘ we hope that the new drug will ultimately offer hope for patients who are n’t helped by current treatments			0
’ prof @entity89 said neuropathic was caused by hyper - excitability of the nerves			0
he said ‘ the drug is probably blocking the hyper - excitability associated with nerve damage			0
’ he said it would be taken long - term by patients , in the same way that arthritis patients need regular medication			0
@entity123 from the @entity124 said ‘ this is a positive development and we very much welcome it			0
research carried out so far seems to indicate that the treatment is safe , so we hope that new trials with higher doses can make it even more effective			0
’ she added ‘ @entity132 , or @entity64 mainly affects the elderly			0
it can render a patient ’s final years an unendurable misery			0
prompt treatment may help to prevent this , so we urge anyone who thinks they may have shingles to go to the doctor immediately			0
’ @entity142 , the @entity143 based company which owns the drug , now plans a larger trial testing higher doses of the drug for longer periods of time			0
prof @entity89 said ‘ we are looking forward to seeing how @entity6 performs in a larger trial in people with post-herpetic neuralgia , where we will explore higher doses , and in trials where we will analyse its efficacy in other chronic pain conditions			1
‘ identifying the characteristics of the patients who do get good pain relief from @entity6 will also be an important avenue for research			1
’ @entity163 , ceo of @entity142 , said ‘ there is a clear need for new treatments that bring patients pain relief with fewer side effects			1
‘ in addition to post-herpetic neuralgia , we see broad potential for @entity6 to treat a range of chronic painful conditions such as pain due to osteoarthritis and diabetes			1
’ since september certain older people qualify for one - off vaccination against shingles on the @entity179 - those aged 70 or 79			2
research last month found having shingles puts you at higher risk of having a stroke or heart attack years later , particularly when the attack occurs before the age of 40 .			2
