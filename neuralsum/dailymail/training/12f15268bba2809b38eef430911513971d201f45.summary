it ’s a debate that divides people the world over : is the @entity4 shroud a genuine relic or just an elaborate fake ? according to one expert the answer is very much the latter , and he is baffled that no one has noticed irregularities before			1
he says that aside from radiocarbon dating in 1988 showing it originates from the 14th century , there is evidence that it has been altered over time and that it was used specifically during medieval @entity17 rituals			1
he analysed the cloth and found no mention of it from before 1355			1
this split screen shows the likeness between the @entity21 and a portrait of @entity28 by @entity29 the analysis comes from @entity20 scholar and author @entity19 writing for @entity33			1
looking through historical texts , he found no mention of the shroud before 1355 - somewhat odd for an item of such apparent religious significance			1
writer @entity39 has claimed that there is little evidence for a person known as @entity28 existing in history			1
@entity28 is thought to have lived from about @entity44 to 33ad in the @entity45			1
however @entity39 says he found little to no mention of the supposed messiah in 126 texts written in the first to third centuries			1
only one mention of @entity28 was present , in a book by @entity54 historian @entity53 , but he says this was added by later editors			1
he says this is surprising despite the ‘ alleged worldwide fame ’ of @entity28			2
this has led him to believe that @entity28 was a ' mythical character '			2
he then notes that the artefact was acquired by the @entity62 - one of the oldest royal familes in the world - and turned into a ‘ high - prestige relic ’ in 1453 , reports @entity66			0
but following this he found that depictions of the shroud , including an engraving by artist @entity71 in 1613 , were different from the shroud we know today			0
they focused on features that are no longer easy to spot , including the @entity77 and long hair on @entity28 ’s neck			2
in addition , it is no longer easy to see that the figure in the shroud was once covered in blood and marks from where he had been struck			0
‘ astonishingly , few researchers appear to have grasped that the shroud looked very different in the 16th and 17th centuries from the object we see today , ’ @entity19 writes			2
this leads him to believe that the shroud was mostly likely just a prop used in medieval @entity17 rituals			2
he believed it was used in a ceremony called the ‘ @entity99 ? ’ or ‘ whom do you seek ? ’ this ceremony involved re-enacting gospel accounts of the resurrection			0
‘ they would enter a makeshift tomb and bring out the grave clothes to show that @entity28 had indeed risen , ’ @entity19 says			1
the shroud is set to be exhibited next year in @entity4 for the first time in five years , with two million people expected to visit it			1
the linen cloth , believed by some to have wrapped the body of @entity28 , has captivated the imagination of historians , church chiefs , sceptics and @entity118 for more than 500 years			1
there are no definite historical records concerning the shroud prior to the 14th century			0
although there are numerous reports of @entity28 ' burial shroud , or an image of his head , of unknown origin , being venerated in various locations before the 14th century			2
but there is no historical evidence that these refer to the shroud currently at @entity132			0
a burial cloth , which some historians maintain was the @entity21 , was owned by the @entity136 emperors but disappeared during the @entity137 in 1204			1
historical records seem to indicate that a shroud bearing an image of a crucified man existed in the small town of @entity143 around the years 1353 to 1357			0
it was in the possession of a @entity147 @entity146 , @entity148 , who died at the @entity149 in 1356			0
however the correspondence of this shroud with the shroud in @entity4 , and its very origin has been debated by scholars and lay authors , with claims of forgery attributed to artists born a century apart			2
some contend that the @entity143 shroud was the work of a confessed forger and murderer			0
the history of the shroud from the 15th century is well recorded			0
in 1532 , the shroud suffered damage from a fire in a chapel of @entity170 , capital of the @entity173 region , where it was stored			0
a drop of molten silver from the reliquary produced a symmetrically placed mark through the layers of the folded cloth			0
poor @entity181 attempted to repair this damage with patches			0
in 1578 @entity184 , @entity185 ordered the cloth to be brought from @entity170 to @entity4 and it has remained at @entity4 ever since			1
the shroud has had many notorious admirers			0
it even obsessed @entity189 dictator @entity188 , who wanted to steal it so he could use it in a black magic ceremony			0
in may 2010 , five years after he became @entity194 , @entity193 authorised a public viewing of the @entity21 - the first since 2000			2
@entity19 believes that the shroud was mostly likely just a prop used in medieval @entity17 rituals ( stock image shown )			1
he believed it was used in a ceremony called the ‘ @entity99 ? ’ or ‘ whom do you seek ? ’ this involved re-enacting gospel accounts of the resurrection this picture from @entity4 in 1967 apparently shows the profile of @entity28 from the @entity21			1
radiocarbon dating in 1988 , however , suggested the @entity21 was no older than the 14th century			0

@entity20 scholar @entity19 says @entity21 is a medieval prop
he analysed the cloth and found no mention of it from before 1355
it had been altered since then , though , suggesting it was a prop
he says it was used in plays depicting the resurrection of @entity28
some believe the linen cloth wrapped the body of @entity28
next year more than two million people will descend on @entity4 to see it
