@entity1 political editor @entity0 has apologised for directly quoting a source who used the phrase ' of @entity5 appearance ' the @entity1 's political editor has apologised for directly quoting a @entity8 source who described the @entity10 killers as being ' of @entity5 appearance '			1
@entity0 said he was sorry for using the phrase , which ' was both liable to be misinterpreted and to cause offence ' , during the @entity13 at six broadcast yesterday			1
the corporation received dozens of complaints after he used the comment just hours after @entity19 soldier @entity18 , 25 , was brutally murdered in the street			1
@entity0 today took to his @entity1 blog to apologise for using the phrase			1
he explains how he was informed by a senior @entity8 source just minutes before the @entity24 yesterday that the incident was being treated as a suspected terrorist incident			1
he wrote : ' the police had , i was told , described the attackers as being " of @entity5 appearance " and shouting " @entity30 "			2
on air i directly quoted a senior @entity34 source saying that the police had used that description			1
' that phrase " of @entity5 appearance " clearly offended some who demanded to know what it could possibly mean			2
others were concerned that it was a racist generalisation			2
' the @entity1 received a total of 43 complaints after @entity0 used the phrase , @entity46 has reported			1
@entity0 's report was also picked up by other media organisations who reported it as evidence that the incident was a terror attack			1
the dead soldier , who was wearing a @entity56 top , was hit by a @entity57 on the pavement before two crazed men attacked him with knives			2
witnesses said the suspects ' hacked and chopped ' at his body and were shouting ' @entity30 ! ' - an @entity5 phrase meaning ' @entity65 is great ' - and yelling ' this is what @entity65 would have wanted			2
' one of the men was identified as @entity69 , 28 , who ranted on camera with a clear south @entity72 accent saying ' you people will never be safe '			0
the suspected killers were later shot by police and will be questioned by anti-terror officers once they have recovered			0
@entity0 took to his @entity1 blog today to apologise for using the phrase one of the alleged attackers ( left ) rants at the camera while holding bloodied weapons			1
a second suspected killer ( right ) speaks to @entity84 who jumped off her bus when she saw the dead man @entity0 wrote on his blog : ' the reports of eye witnesses and the video of the attacker demonstrated that the attack had been carried out by those claiming to be retaliating because " @entity95 are dying daily by @entity19 soldiers "			1
' despite this and the fact that i was directly quoting a source i 'm sorry for using a phrase that , on reflection , was both liable to be misinterpreted and to cause offence			1
many muslims were quick to condemn the attack and to distance themselves and their religion from the brutal savagery seen on the streets of @entity10			0
' the comment yesterday sparked complaints from users on social networking and micro-blogging sites , including @entity113 , a film reviewer and panellist on @entity116 's @entity115 , who wrote on @entity117 : ' whatever just happened , @ @entity119 , it is entirely not ok for your correspondents to refer to anyone as " of @entity5 appearance "			2
' a picture of victim drummer @entity18 , of the @entity126 's @entity125 , is displayed with flowers left by mourners outside an army barracks near the scene of his killing in @entity10 a @entity56 t - shirt was left among the floral tributes in recognition of the top the soldier was wearing at the time of his death it was a barbaric attack carried out in broad daylight on the streets of @entity72			1
a man hacked to death			0
the attackers had been shot by the police			0
an extraordinary and horrific story but not one , you might think , for the political editor of the @entity1			2
however , the fact that the victim was wearing a ' @entity56 ' t - shirt and was walking near an army barracks raised the possibility that it was something else as well - an act of terrorism with implications for the country as a whole			0
that was my instinct as soon as i heard about the story , but instinct is not enough			0
i started to try to establish whether the government was treating it that way			0
with minutes to go before the @entity13 at six i was told by a senior @entity8 source that the incident was being treated as a suspected terrorist incident and being taken very seriously indeed			1
this information changed the news from a crime story to something of more significance			0
the police had , i was told , described the attackers as being ' of @entity5 appearance ' and shouting ' @entity30 '			0
on air i directly quoted a senior @entity8 source saying that the police had used that description			1
that phrase ' of @entity5 appearance ' clearly offended some who demanded to know what it could possibly mean			2
others were concerned that it was a racist generalisation			0
my report and the quotation were picked up by many other news organisations as evidence that this was a terror attack			0
the reports of eye witnesses and the video of the attacker demonstrated that the attack had been carried out by those claiming to be retaliating because ' @entity95 are dying daily by @entity19 soldiers '			0
despite this and the fact that i was directly quoting a source i 'm sorry for using a phrase that , on reflection , was both liable to be misinterpreted and to cause offence			1
many muslims were quick to condemn the attack and to distance themselves and their religion from the brutal savagery seen on the streets of @entity10			0
the overnight protests of the @entity212 and attacks on some mosques lead some to fear the consequences for community relations			0
this all makes people understandably sensitive about anything which could be used to justify hostility to people on the basis of their appearance or religion .			0

@entity0 used the phrase hours after soldier @entity18 was murdered
he has now apologised after the @entity1 received dozens of complaints
he said he used the phrase while directly quoting a @entity8 source
