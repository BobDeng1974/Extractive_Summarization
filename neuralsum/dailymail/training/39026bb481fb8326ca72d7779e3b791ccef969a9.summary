by @entity0 published : 18:54 est , 22 july 2013 updated : 09:58 est , 23 july 2013 @entity0 and son @entity1 in the same @entity3 wing as the @entity4 , after @entity1 comes out of the @entity5 in @entity6 looking at tv footage of the @entity9 at @entity11 ’s @entity10 , chosen by the @entity4 for the birth of her first child , i could n’t help but smile			1
seeing it brings memories flooding back of the six days i spent there when i became a first - time mother 13 years ago			2
terrified and totally unprepared for childbirth on my arrival , i experienced warmth , kindness and love there			2
when i left with my new baby , i was set up for life			1
quite simply , the @entity27 taught me everything i needed to be a mother			1
it ’s the best baby boot camp in the world			1
the secrets of the @entity3 are not high - tech. indeed , they ’re unorthodox : from red wine for dinner and a surprising use for grated carrots to grandmotherly care and a constant supply of cabbage leaves			1
i never expected to give birth at the private hospital favoured by royals			2
i was fortunate my father - in - law insisted on paying the cost			2
the @entity3 is the specialist private maternity and obstetrician unit at @entity10 in @entity47 , @entity11			2
princess @entity48 gave birth to @entity50 and @entity51 there			2
a normal delivery sets you back at least £ 6,000 , but costs can spiral to an eye - watering £ 10,000 if you need a caesarean section , as i did			2
what do you get for that ? well , there ’s a tv , jewellery safe and fridge in every room , and the food and wine list is restaurant standard			2
but what makes the @entity69 unique is the exclusive attention of the most skilled obstetricians in the country			1
@entity4 has been attended by @entity73 , the @entity74 ’s gynaecologist			1
from the moment she arrived at the @entity69 , she will have been lavished with care by a team of dedicated nurses and midwives			1
the practical , old - fashioned tenets i was taught there — such as introducing a strict routine with my baby from day one — have n’t just helped me raise confident , happy children , they ’ve also helped make us a happy , united family			1
a @entity90 flies outside the @entity91 of @entity10 , where @entity92 , @entity4 gave birth a designated midwife tended me throughout my stay			1
she helped turn me and my husband from a frightened couple into confident parents			2
@entity99 , a photographer , and i met at the newspaper where i was an executive : our son @entity1 was conceived on our wedding night			2
three months into my pregnancy , i put myself under the care of obstetrician @entity107 , who shares consulting rooms in @entity109 with @entity73			1
he recommended i book the @entity3			2
high profile : members of the media outside the @entity9 this week as the new baby prince was born i saw mr @entity107 every two weeks and my pregnancy went smoothly			1
i did n’t read a single baby book or attend an antenatal class , having decided to leave all that until my maternity leave			1
@entity1 was due on may 17 , 2000 , and in early april i stopped working , preparing to put my feet up and start reading baby books			1
i ’d not even finished the first chapter when , six days later , on april 27 , my waters broke			2
trying to control my rising panic , i rang mr @entity107 , who urged me to go straight to the @entity3			2
it took 12 minutes to get there — the longest 12 minutes of my life			1
the huge wooden doors opened and a nurse in a navy uniform and sensible shoes greeted me with a warm smile			2
she took my arm and guided me gently inside			2
‘ it ’s @entity0 , is n’t it ? ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m looking after you and i promise you ’ll be absolutely fine			0
you need some rest before the baby comes			1
’ in that second , my fear floated away and this lovely middle - aged woman became my guardian angel			0
by the time mr @entity107 arrived at 11pm , i was tucked up in soft white sheets , with fresh flowers on my bedside table			1
less hectic : police officers stand outside the @entity91 of @entity10 , a favourite with @entity147 my room was just how i imagine @entity150 maternity units used to be , with everything spotless			0
hooked up to monitors and checked constantly , the hours passed in a blur as i drifted in and out of sleep , desperately hoping the contractions would start			0
i ’d been there for more than 24 hours when i was told i ’d need a @entity158			0
the baby was vulnerable to infection without his sac of amniotic fluid to protect him			1
squeezing my hand , the midwife reassured me : ‘ it will all work out well			0
you ’ll soon have the loveliest baby in your arms			1
’ our son was born at 4.16am on april 29			0
though he was three weeks premature , he weighed a healthy 6lb 1oz			0
but he was so fragile i was allowed to hold him for only a few minutes before he was taken to the intensive care unit			1
the nurses comforted me until , 12 hours later , he was back in my arms			0
and then it hit me that i was responsible for the tiny creature i was cradling			0
i felt a mixture of unbelievable joy and terror			0
but that ’s when the @entity27 comes into its own			1
i was put in the care of @entity184 — a @entity185 in her mid- 60s who had more experience than an army of grannies			1
i was guided through everything , from what i should eat to produce the best breast milk to bedtime rituals			0
soon after the @entity4 was admitted to the @entity9 at @entity10 in @entity11 , police control the crowds in order to speed up the production of milk and reduce swelling of the breasts , @entity184 had shown me how to place cabbage leaves inside my bra			1
it worked a treat and i was able to feed him within hours			0
as @entity1 was premature , @entity184 advised me to feed him for 15 minutes from each breast every three hours			1
as he gained weight , i was to increase this to every four hours			0
this old - fashioned routine worked like a charm			0
he fed easily and slept beautifully			0
she also showed me a great trick to prevent my breasts getting sore — sleeping with grated carrot inside my bra			0
the carrot toughened up the nipples , meaning that when @entity1 was placed on my breast in the morning it did n’t hurt			0
@entity184 instructed me and @entity99 how to wind our baby by putting him across our knees , then gently rubbing his back			1
her lessons were invaluable : @entity1 never had colic			0
she also advised me to sleep when @entity1 took his nap			0
‘ your body needs to rest in order to produce good milk , ’ she said			0
i carried on this ritual until i went back to work when he was ten months old			0
perhaps the best thing about the @entity3 is the way it forges a bond between father and baby			1
every day , @entity99 and i had lessons together in the creche			0
@entity184 insisted we took turns changing nappies and cleaning @entity1 ’s bottom , using dampened cotton wool pads rather than baby wipes , which can be too harsh			1
best of all , @entity184 suggested @entity99 make a habit of bathing @entity1 while i rested			1
‘ it will be your special time with him , ’ she said			0
i ca n’t thank her enough			0
@entity99 never felt pushed out and would rush home to be with @entity1			0
hearing our son gurgle with glee as his father bathed him was magical			0
i expect @entity3 staff will be sending out prince @entity50 to buy a case of expensive red wine — not for him , but for @entity4			1
‘ @entity262 needs to drink half a glass of good red wine every evening with her supper , ’ @entity184 told @entity261 ‘ it will relax her , so she produces lots of lovely milk for @entity1 ’s last feed of the day			1
that will help him sleep through the night			0
’ when i walked down the steps of the @entity3 with five - day - old @entity1 in my arms , it was a wrench to leave , but i knew i ’d been given something precious — instruction in how to be a good mother .			0

i was put in the care of @entity184 , in her mid- 60s who had more experience than an army of grannies
when i left with my new baby , i was set up for life . quite simply , the @entity27 taught me everything
from the moment @entity4 arrived at the @entity69 , she will have been lavished with care
