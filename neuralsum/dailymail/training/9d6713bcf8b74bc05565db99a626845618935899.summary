by @entity0 there 's no need to be disappointed about this week 's news that resveratrol wo n't help you live longer , as scientists are now championing a different antioxidant in the fight against ageing			1
called glutathione , it is molecule produced by the body to fight free radicals			1
dr @entity17 , a @entity18 plastic surgeon and founder of a new supplement containing the ingredient , said : ' glutathione is the body 's most powerful antioxidant and detoxifying agent , but outside the science community , few people have even heard of it			1
beauty boost : three 111skin capsules must be taken a day to stimulating the production of glutathione - which is said to combat the signs of ageing ' it 's now time to raise awareness on thismolecule that delivers incredible health benefits , and even helps slow the aging process			2
' glutathione has such a powerful regenerative effect on cells , when someone takes a paracetamol overdose and the liver goes into failure , to reverse the effect and ultimately stop them dying , they are given a pure @entity39 drip			2
but the makers of the new supplement , @entity52 , have used it to create a product aimed at those who want younger looking skin			2
three capsules must be taken a day to stimulate the production of glutathione , with the theory being that the body 's cells ability to fight free radical damage is then strengthened , and the ageing process is delayed			1
as with much of the 111skin range , the supplement was developed with the help of astronauts			2
dr @entity17 explains : ' my team of scientists previously worked on the @entity72 , and their role was to keep astronauts in orbit in peak health and this meant harnessing the ability to raise the levels of the most powerful antioxidant in the body			1
111 @entity83 capsules , left , contain @entity39			0
it can also be found in fruit and vegetables including avocado ' they discovered that @entity90 supplements combined with key vitamins in their purest form , effectively stimulated the production of glutathione , and they patented their formula unique to @entity95			0
' dr @entity17 claims their formula is more effective than other glutathione supplements currently on the market which have been found to be ineffective when taken orally because it is poorly absorbed and broken down by the stomach			0
@entity52 launches at @entity102 in august with a bottle of 90 capsules costing £ 75			0
in the meantime , it 's available via their website 111skin.com			0
dr @entity17 said : ' it 's always been our goal to bring these supplements to a wider market , and as environmental and lifestyle aggressors increase on earth , we knew that space would dictate the future for wellbeing			0
' for those who would rather not take three tablets a day - or shell out £ 75 for the capsules - but still want to see if they can tackle the signs of ageing with glutathione , simply eat more foods containing the antioxidant			1
glutathione can be found in numerous fruit and vegetables including broccoli , brussel sprouts , cabbage , red peppers , avocados , peaches , watermelon and tomatoes .			0
