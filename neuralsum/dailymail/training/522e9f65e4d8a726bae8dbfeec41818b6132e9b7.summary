demands : @entity1 mp is leading a @entity3 backbench attack on @entity4 @entity5 should have the power to give a ‘ red card ’ to @entity8 proposals and existing laws and limit the right to freedom of movement across the @entity13 , according to the leader of a group of 100 @entity17			1
@entity1 , co-founder of the @entity19 group of @entity20 , said that without such changes there would be overwhelming calls for @entity5 to exit the @entity8			1
her intervention comes ahead of a major speech tomorrow by @entity26 on @entity5 ’s future in a reformed @entity28			1
@entity29 is struggling to maintain @entity3 unity on the issue , with more than 90 backbenchers this week backing a call for @entity34 to gain a unilateral veto over new @entity8 laws			2
foreign secretary @entity37 yesterday dismissed that idea , saying it would undermine the single market and make even a @entity42 or @entity43 - style trading relationship with the @entity8 impossible			2
but he suggested the government is ready to back the idea of allowing a bloc of ten or fewer @entity8 states to veto unwelcome laws in the renegotiation talks promised by mr @entity29 to claw back powers before an ‘ in / out ’ referendum on membership			2
mrs @entity1 , writing for @entity53 , argued @entity5 should demand the creation of a ‘ permanent means by which a group of member states ’ can reject @entity8 proposals or existing laws which undermine their interests or are no longer necessary ’			1
other reforms suggested by the @entity19 group include the rejection of the @entity8 ’s founding principle of ‘ ever closer union ’ , which she says is ‘ no longer relevant or necessary ’			1
foreign secretary @entity37 yesterday dismissed the idea of a unilateral veto , warning it would undermine the @entity8 single market free movement legislation , which enshrines the right of all @entity8 citizens to move to other countries and work and settle there , should be amended to eliminate ‘ unintended consequences ’ , she adds			1
ministers are backing the idea that the right of citizens of new member states to migrate elsewhere should be blocked until average incomes reach a certain point			0
the group of mps also wants to scrap @entity8 quangos , introduce ‘ severe penalties ’ for fraud and error in @entity8 budgets and see @entity4 agree to a ‘ full review of how taxpayers ’ money is used by the @entity8 ’			2
‘ the way the @entity8 works now fails to meet the aspirations of the @entity5 people on crucial levels			1
if the @entity8 is not fundamentally reformed , the clamour for @entity5 withdrawal may become overwhelming , ’ mrs @entity1 said			1
‘ the @entity8 is at a fork in the road			0
if there is not meaningful reform of the @entity8 over the next few years it will continue to lose out against emerging , more competitive countries			2
as an organisation , it is over-regulated and bureaucratic and it lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many citizens in @entity8 countries			0
’ mr @entity37 yesterday said the idea of every nation being able to go it alone and reject any @entity4 edict would be unworkable ‘ in any system which relies on common rules ’			0
mr @entity37 clashed with @entity117 - who dismissed suggestions the @entity8 is to blame for unsustainable levels of immigration but he suggested @entity3 plans to renegotiate @entity5 ’s @entity8 membership before an in - out referendum would include a ‘ red card ’ system that would allow fewer than ten nations to reject @entity8 laws outright			1
‘ we do want a much bigger role for national parliaments , ’ the foreign secretary said			0
‘ it ’s common ground not only in the @entity3 but in the country that the powers of the @entity8 have increased too much , that they are too great , that they must be diminished			2
’ mr @entity37 clashed with former @entity3 chancellor @entity117 , who dismissed suggestions that the @entity8 is to blame for ‘ unsustainable ’ levels of immigration			0
mr @entity117 , who sits in the @entity138 as the prime minister ’s trade envoy , said : ‘ i just do n’t think it ’s true that the @entity8 is responsible for unacceptable waves of migration			0
the idea that you can have some fundamental debate that somehow stops all these foreigners coming here is rather typical right - wing , nationalist escapism			0
’ mr @entity37 insisted the lifting of controls on incomers from eastern @entity28 countries who joined the @entity8 had triggered ‘ large - scale migration ’ and had been a ‘ mistake ’			1
but @entity158 , the @entity8 ’s social affairs commissioner , suggested @entity5 were ‘ emotional and misguided ’ over the issue and would ‘ pay more attention to the facts ’ in the absence of a big influx from @entity164 and @entity165			1
chief secretary to the treasury , @entity166 , said the idea of a national veto against @entity8 proposals was ‘ potty ’			1
@entity170 , one of @entity172 ’s closest advisers , agreed			0
he said : ‘ the impossible @entity3 demands of @entity28 must leave @entity8 allies thinking : “ the conservatives do n’t want @entity8 reform			1
they want to wreck it or leave it ”			0
’ by @entity181 way the @entity8 works now fails to meet the aspirations of the @entity5 people on crucial levels			1
if the @entity8 is not fundamentally reformed , the clamour for @entity5 withdrawal may become overwhelming			1
the next few years present a unique opportunity for such reform			0
the eurozone crisis means that the status quo in the @entity8 is no longer an option — those countries who use the euro are moving towards closer fiscal and financial integration			0
so where does that leave the wider @entity8 , and the 175 million citizens of countries who are not euro members ? even without that elephant in the room , the @entity8 is facing a crisis of competitiveness and a crisis of legitimacy			0
mr @entity29 is said to be struggling to maintain party unity on the issue the @entity8 is at a fork in the road			0
if there is not meaningful reform of the @entity8 over the next few years it will continue to lose out against emerging , more competitive countries			2
as an organisation , it is over-regulated and bureaucratic and it lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many citizens in @entity8 countries			0
the @entity5 can be pivotal in securing profound and necessary reform			0
the prime minister is rightly leading the debate on @entity8 reform with calls for greater competitiveness , flexibility and democratic accountability			2
however , there are many on the continent who continue to regard the @entity5 with deep suspicion			2
on a recent visit to the @entity235 to discuss @entity8 reform with @entity235 parliamentarians , they showed how wary they are of @entity5 motives : ‘ we are your allies , but do n’t hug us too close , ’ they say			1
mr @entity26 is set to delivery a major speech on @entity5 's future in a reformed @entity28 tomorrow as @entity5 politicians , we need to engage better with our @entity28 colleagues to understand where their interests are , and to persuade them of the merits of the case for reform			1
this week , i am co-hosting a conference in @entity250 to discuss detailed proposals for reform of the @entity8			2
it will bring together participants from over 30 countries , including all 28 @entity8 member states , and will feature keynote speeches from ministers , commissioners ; mps ; @entity260 ; and leading business figures			0
my discussions with mps from other @entity28 member states often start with a degree of scepticism on their part — they say ‘ you are just cherry - picking the best deal for the @entity5 ’ or ‘ you just want to leave the @entity8 , so why should we bother			1
’ following discussion of specific proposals however , we discover there is a great deal of common ground			0
we are pressing for : incorporation into the @entity8 's fabric acceptance of the principle that ever closer union is no longer relevant or necessary the creation of a permanent means by which a group of member @entity284 ' governments can reject @entity8 proposals or existing laws which undermine their interests or are no longer necessary far - reaching reinforcement of the @entity290 , particularly in services , which is a @entity5 strength strengthening of accountability between voters and those who represent them at @entity28 level strong commitment to improving the performance of the @entity8 through scrapping @entity8 quangos , agreeing severe penalties for fraud and error in @entity8 budgets and committing to a full review of how taxpayers ' money is used by the @entity8 elimination of the unintended consequences of the free movement legislation			1
of course not everyone will agree with everything			0
the art of negotiation is to craft a deal that will satisfy most people			0
the challenge is to develop a reformed @entity8 that is globally competitive and democratically accountable			1
if we do this , we will have a union that is fit for the @entity321 , and one that the @entity5 people can be comfortable with at last .			0

group of @entity325 want to limit free movement across continent
also want to ' give red card ' to @entity8 proposals and existing laws
group headed by @entity1 , who says without change there would be ' overwhelming ' calls for @entity5 to exit @entity8
in @entity53 piece , mp *outlines* what @entity19 group are pressing for
says challenge is to make a reformed ' competitive and accountable ' @entity8
@entity26 will tomorrow speak about the country 's future in @entity28
