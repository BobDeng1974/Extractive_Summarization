@entity1 boss @entity0 was linked to a special school at the centre of one of @entity6 ’s worst child sex abuse scandals , @entity7 can reveal			1
methodist minister @entity0 was vice-chairman of @entity9 ’s social services committee which oversaw @entity10 , during a time when it was described as a ‘ sweet shop for paedophiles ’			1
yet a series of damning reports – at least one sent to @entity0 – about the crimes at @entity10 were hidden from the public			1
@entity0 was vice-chairman of @entity9 ’s social services committee which oversaw @entity10 , during a time when it was described as a ‘ sweet shop for paedophiles ’ @entity10 the residential unit for boys aged seven to 16 with learning and behavioural problems is now subject to a police investigation into the sexual and physical abuse of former pupils			1
meanwhile @entity9 is conducting its own inquiry into @entity0 ’s years as a councillor in the light of his drug - taking , exposed by @entity7 last month			1
the @entity10 scandal broke last year after the @entity35 accepted that the school ’s founder , the late @entity37 mp @entity36 , who knew @entity38 through the council , should have been prosecuted for child abuse			1
the school , founded in 1969 , eventually closed in 1995 , after a member of staff alerted council bosses to ongoing problems			1
yet alarm bells were being rung constantly by health professionals from 1988 to 1992 when @entity0 held key council posts			1
@entity51 , whose appointment as the school ’s head of care heralded its closure , said : ‘ @entity0 was one of many people in power in @entity9 who knew what was happening and yet did not act to close the school down			1
he was vice-chair of the social services committee in 1991 when the first of three reports was circulated internally about the risk to pupils in terms of sexual and physical abuse			1
he knew what the parents of pupils were never told – that the school was basically a sweet shop for paedophiles			2
’ the current storm surrounding 63 - year - old @entity0 ’s shocking drugs habit prompted his arrest by police on suspicion of supplying @entity76 drugs , including cocaine and crystal meth			1
the @entity79 is holding an inquiry into the @entity1 , where he was chairman until his resignation in june , and the bank has launched its own internal review			2
flowers was suspended by the @entity85 and the @entity86 for which he was a minister in @entity88			0
by the time @entity0 moved to @entity9 in september 1986 to take over the @entity86 at @entity89 in @entity90 , he was already a controversial figure			1
in 1981 while ministering in @entity92 , he was fined £ 75 for ‘ gross indecency ’ in a public toilet with a trucker and was moved to @entity96 by the church			0
four years later , he was chosen as a @entity85 prospective parliamentary candidate for @entity99 , in the @entity100 , but he resigned three months later when his criminal record surfaced			0
' @entity102 ' : mp @entity36 in 1972 with @entity9 children not from @entity10			1
@entity0 has been linked to @entity10 , founded by @entity36 and at the centre of a sex abuse scandal once in @entity9 , @entity0 , an ardent @entity85 supporter , was elected to the council in 1988 and joined its education and social services committees			1
in 1988 dr @entity110 , a child psychiatrist at the town ’s @entity111 , first alerted the council to possible sexual abuse at @entity10			1
three years later , @entity115 , of the @entity116 , was asked to go to the school to carry out a ‘ sexuality ’ training day with staff			2
his discoveries , penned in a report to council bosses , were shocking : ‘ one boy who is homosexual has contact with an adult outside the school			1
several of the senior boys indulge in oral sex with one another			0
‘ reputedly five of the junior boys have been or are involved in “ cottaging ” in and around public toilets			0
men as far away as @entity134 are believed to be aware of this activity and travel to @entity9 to take part			2
power : the @entity38 in 1990 when he held key @entity9 posts one eight year old is thought to have been involved			2
some boys have been “ forced ” to have sex with each other			0
’ he concluded : ‘ we are committed to preventing the spread of @entity147			0
the boys in this school look to us to be increasingly at risk			0
’ one former pupil , @entity152 , now 41 but aged seven when at the school , told the @entity153 : ‘ our lives were a living hell			2
teachers would take pupils to a public toilet in @entity159 where the boys would have sex with men who had travelled from all over the @entity163			2
men would come to the school and we were made to have sex with them			0
i was forced to perform a sex act on the late mp @entity36 who we called the @entity169			0
‘ it had such an effect on us that some of the boys have either committed suicide or are in prison			0
‘ i feel let down by the council because we were vulnerable children and they were supposed to be taking care of us but instead we were exposed to the most horrible acts of depravity			0
’ the @entity7 has seen a letter , dated april 16 , 1991 , concerning this report from the director of social services to the local health authority , copied to @entity0 among others			1
by then , @entity0 and his colleagues on @entity9 social services committee were already facing calls to resign over the satanic abuse scandal when 16 children were wrongly taken from their parents and rehomed , some in @entity10			1
last week , @entity9 announced an inquiry into his time at the authority			1
a spokesman said : ‘ we have nothing to hide and want to move on from the past			0
it was a dreadful period and unfortunately @entity199 was around at the time , although whether he was calling any shots is another matter			0
’ there is no suggestion that @entity0 was in any way involved in criminal activity at @entity206 , @entity0 had been going through a turbulent time			2
in october 1990 , he suffered a suspected heart attack a day after his car was stolen and his house burgled			0
the following month , he was forced to come out as gay after his gross indecency conviction came to light			0
last night , the @entity153 put the @entity214 ’s link to @entity10 as well as the latest text message revelations to his lawyer			1
solicitor @entity217 said : ‘ i can make no comment whatsoever			0
it would be in everybody ’s interests if the spotlight was turned off to let the police make their inquiries			0
’ since @entity7 first revealed his debauched lifestyle , the reverend @entity0 ’s fall from grace has been accompanied by lurid text insights into a man obsessed by drugs and sex			2
now a series of text messages between the @entity86 minister and a male escort throws a fresh light on the depths of his depravity and prove that his use of hard drugs was no aberration			0
as these messages show , immediately after the story of his shocking lifestyle first became public , he was planning a trip to @entity245 with two rent boys			1
and his favourite method of payment for the services of young men was telephone banking			0
we join the minister on october 29 , after he has spent the day waiting in vain to give evidence to the @entity256 , only for his appearance to be @entity258 is reclining with one escort while making plans to see two more the following night ... @entity0 surfaced mid-afternoon and once he transferred the money for sex , his mind was soon back to his other preoccupation			2
it 's the following wednesday and his appearance before the @entity269 is over with a prayer to read later that morning at @entity88 ’s @entity272 service , @entity199 limbered up with an alarming unholy trinity of mind - altering substances			1
his @entity277 bender still ongoing , a friend helps the @entity199 find a novel new way of imbibing his favourite horse tranquilliser , ketamine			0
worried by the sudden break of contact , his friends ask if something ’s wrong			0
his double life has been exposed by @entity7			0
ever the forward - planner , @entity0 is soon thinking ahead to when the story is all forgotten and holidays can be taken			2
