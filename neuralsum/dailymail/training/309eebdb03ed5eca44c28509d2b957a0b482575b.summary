a giant 18 - metre tall @entity0 that has watched over a capital city each festive season since the 1960s may have seen in his last @entity5			1
looking down on busy @entity7 in the city of @entity9 on @entity11 's @entity10 , the huge icon has been deemed unworthy of the $ 180,000 bill it takes to care for him each year			1
locals know the figure for his ' creepy ' winking eye and wagging finger , the @entity20 reported , but they 're also devastated to see him go			0
but according to the website , @entity27 announced they were no longer in a position to foot the bill and gave @entity0 to the city of @entity9 as a gift			1
from then the city centre business association @entity33 ( @entity34 ) partially funded the creepy statue 's existence with the help of some sponsorships			0
he has been looking over @entity9 , @entity11 for more than half a centurt the jolly man had a make - over and his disturbing winking eye was fixed so his presence was a little less frightening			2
but despite this a few years back he was voted the world 's creepiest @entity5 ornament by an @entity47 website			2
@entity11 's prime minister @entity48 spoke to more fm on thursday morning , calling the demise of the special @entity0 a national outrage			1
' i remember that @entity0 there with the slightly dodgy winking eye and the finger			2
but apparently the winking eye has been fixed up			0
it 's been around since 1960 for goodness sake			0
' a few years back he was voted the world 's creepiest @entity5 ornament by an @entity47 website he added that a working bee could be a good idea to help cover the costs , as the government would n't be able to help the city out and fund the friendly figure			1
in a bid to try and save the @entity0 the @entity70 hotel in @entity9 has kicked off donations with $ 50,000 , and encouraged other businesses to join			1
but for now , the jolly statue is in pieces in storage , and will be kept there until it 's decided what to do with him			0
but one thing is for sure , locals are very upset about the loss of the statue that 's knows when they 're all sleeping , and knows when they 're awake for now , the jolly statue is in pieces in storage , and will be kept there until it 's decided what to do with him			0

the huge @entity0 figure has looked over @entity9 since the 1960s
he may not see another @entity5 because he costs $ 180k a year
@entity11 's prime minister *suggested* a working bee to save @entity5
