by mail online reporter the @entity1 claims a thorough search of their archives revealed no evidence of tapes showing @entity7 bomber @entity6 had a accomplice the @entity1 has dismissed claims they are withholding security camera footage that proves a second man was involved in the @entity7 bombing , insisting agents searched their archives thoroughly and found no evidence of any such material			1
@entity17 lawyer @entity16 has launched a freedom of information lawsuit against the @entity1 and the @entity19 , demanding they release the alleged videos which supposedly show a man alongside @entity6 when he parked a truck outside the @entity7 federal building and detonated a bomb that killed 168 people			1
but yesterday , on the first day of the trial , @entity27 , a longtime @entity1 employee who became the point person for the collection of evidence after the bombing , said she is ' completely confident ' the agency has found every video of the bombing that exists			1
@entity1 attorney @entity36 argued additional searches for videos would be burdensome and fruitless , and would take a single staff person more than 18 months to conduct			2
she said : ' the plaintiff has refused to accept that the 30 tapes he got are the only tapes '			0
mr @entity16 believes the presence of a second suspect in the truck explains why his brother , @entity16 , was flown to @entity7 several months after the bombing , where he died in a federal holding cell in what was labeled a suicide			1
his belief that the tapes exists stems from a @entity52 document written shortly after the bombing that describes security video footage of the attack that shows suspects - in plural - exiting the truck three minutes before it went off			2
@entity16 bore a striking resemblance to the police sketch that officials sent out after the bombing based on witness descriptions of the enigmatic suspect ' @entity64 no. 2 , ' who was the same height , build and complexion			2
the suspect was never identified			0
the @entity1 already has provided videos and paper documents that correspond with @entity16 's @entity86 request , ms @entity36 said			1
the trial continues today and will run at least through wednesday before the judge makes a ruling			0
he could wait until a later date to decide			0
if mr @entity16 wins , he hopes to be able to search for the tapes himself rather than having to accept the @entity1 's answer that they do n't exist			1
mr @entity16 is acting as his own attorney and tried to show that the @entity1 has not adequately followed up on information that could lead to the discovery of other videos			1
he asked @entity98 of the @entity1 about why the agency had not done more to search for a tape mentioned in a @entity52 log			2
it describes security video footage of suspects — in plural — exiting the truck three minutes before the bomb went off			0
' did n't it come to your mind that that tape may exist ? ' mr @entity16 asked			1
ms @entity98 said she did n't know the authenticity of the @entity52 document and that @entity114 told her she did n't know of the existence of such a tape			0
mr @entity16 asked if ms @entity98 had asked @entity1 headquarters about the tape , citing documents that show it had one tape and 300 pages of documents			1
she acknowledged she had not asked headquarters about those items as part of the @entity86 request			0
the wreckage of the @entity129 building burned itself into the national psyche in 19956 but did @entity6 have company when he planted the bomb that did it ? was another man involved ? @entity135 ( left ) was sentenced to life in prison for helping @entity6 plot his terrorist act			1
@entity140 , the star witness in the @entity7 bombing trials , was released from federal prison in 2006 after serving a sentence for failing to inform authorities of what he knew about the bombing plot a @entity52 agent testified in 2004 that the log does exist , but its information was pulled from reports that were never verified , said @entity152 , who was then the assistant to the special agent in charge of the @entity1 's intelligence division			1
several investigators and prosecutors who worked the case told @entity159 in 2004 they had never seen video like that described in the @entity52 log			0
@entity163 and @entity114 described how employees searched automated systems and by hand			0
@entity114 said she spent 85 hours searching three computer databases created to track all the evidence			0
the judge at one point asked @entity163 why the @entity1 never responded to a letter from @entity16 asking about a video that seemed to be incomplete			1
' you basically did nothing ? ' @entity174 asked			0
' we did nothing because we were confident in our search and what we located , ' @entity163 said			0
later , he questioned why @entity181 neglected to send several documents to @entity16 that mentioned videos , despite her previous claim that she erred on the side of inclusivity if she was n't sure whether something fell under his request			2
@entity16 's 44 - year - old brother , who was a convicted bank robber and construction worker , was brought to the @entity194 @entity193 in @entity7 after being picked up for probation violations while coming back to the @entity194 at the @entity197 border , @entity16 said			2
taking the feds to court : now @entity16 is on a mission to reveal the truth about his brother 's death and his suing the @entity1 to get answers unsatisfied by the @entity1 's previous explanations , @entity194 district judge @entity174 has ordered the agency to explain why it ca n't find videos from the bombing that are mentioned in evidence logs , citing the public importance of the tapes			1
' i did not start out to solve the @entity7 bombing , i started out for justice for my brother 's murder , ' @entity16 said			1
' but along the way , every path i took , every lead i got , took me to the bombing			0
' the @entity1 says it ca n't find anything to suggest the videos exist , and says it would be ' unreasonably burdensome ' to do a search that would take a single staff person more than 18 months to conduct			0
@entity227 and @entity228 , who both lost grandchildren in the bombing , are grateful for @entity16 's pursuit of the case			2
@entity227 said she 's been waiting 19 years to see the tapes .			0

@entity16 is demanding @entity1 release footage proving a second man was involved in the *atrocity*
but @entity1 agent tells court their archives have been searched thoroughly and no evidence of the material was found
mr @entity16 believes his brother @entity245 was arrested by the @entity1 after the 1995 bombing in the belief he was @entity6 's accomplice
@entity16 was found dead in a federal holding cell after authorities say he hanged himself
@entity16 is suing the @entity1 to try to get them to reveal information he believes they *'ve* withheld from the public for nearly 20 years
the @entity1 now maintains @entity6 acted alone on the day of the bombing , but had an accomplice in @entity135 and confidante in @entity140
