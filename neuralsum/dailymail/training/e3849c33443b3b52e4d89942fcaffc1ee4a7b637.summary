in a wide - ranging economic stump speech wednesday , president @entity0 focused laser - like on the growing gap between @entity3 's rich and poor , despite polling that shows hardly anyone believes it 's the most pressing issue facing the @entity3 the issue - pivot was an effort to help him move away from the drumbeat of criticism of his policies on health insurance reform and @entity17 's nuclear program , one @entity8 insider said on background			1
' rising inequality and declining mobility is bad for our democracy , ' he said during an event hosted by the far - left @entity24			0
' people get the bad taste that the system is rigged			0
' ' i believe this is the defining challenge of our time , ' @entity0 said of income inequality			1
' it drives everything i do in this office			0
' but according to @entity37 polling from november 7 - 10 , the most recent numbers available , only 1 per cent of @entity3 believe the ' gap between rich and poor ' is the ' most pressing issue ' facing the country			2
yet @entity0 promised on wednesday that ' for the rest of my presidency , that is where you should expect my administration to focus all of our efforts			2
' wage issues , ' @entity37 reports , also rate just 1 - percent support when @entity3 are asked to identify their most pressing concern			2
the @entity62 was quick to pounce			0
a spokesman for sen. @entity64 , the @entity65 's ranking @entity62 , complained that @entity0 's focus on increasing immigration rates has been ' a major factor in the decline of workers ’ wages			1
' ' this trend would be accelerated dramatically and painfully by the president ’s proposal to double the number of guest workers – including h1b workers who will compete directly with struggling college students – while tripling the number of people granted permanent residency			0
' @entity0 's speech was hosted by the liberal @entity24 , a group founded and run by @entity85 white house chief of staff @entity86 but few @entity3 , just 2 per cent , are most concerned about immigration			1
in the fifth year of @entity0 's presidency , ' dissatisfaction with government ' is the single highest - rated @entity3 worry , with 26 per cent saying it makes them more uneasy than any other issue			1
and amid @entity96 's disappointing rollout and early implementation failures , 19 per cent of @entity3 believe healthcare is @entity3 's most important problem			1
wednesday 's speech was a decidedly conscious attempt to pivot away from the singular focus on defending @entity96 that has engulfed the @entity8 for two months			1
the president claimed on wednesday that before his @entity96 became law , 14,000 @entity3 ' lost their health insurance every single day , ' but did n't mention that at least 5 million have lost their medical insurance this fall			0
another 80 million or more are expected to lose their small group insurance coverage , according to 2010 regulatory projections from inside the @entity0 administration			0
unemployment is the most important issue among 13 per cent of @entity3 , according to @entity37 , and the @entity3 budget deficit is feared most by 12 per cent			2
both issues are persistent thorns among @entity0 defenders			0
physician , heal thyself ? twenty - six per cent of @entity3 are more worried about their dysfunctional government than anything else , a number that beats every other specific issue elephant in the room ? @entity62 warn that loosening immigration policy has already driven wages down , and opening the floodgates will make things worse in january 2009 , @entity0 's transition team projected that a broad stimulus spending approach would drive @entity3 's unemployment rate down to 5 per cent by july 2013			1
but even with modest declines , friday 's jobs report is expected to show a 7.2 per cent unemployment rate			0
the so - called ' @entity134 ' unemployment rate , a more realistic measure which also includes @entity3 who have given up searching for work , hit 13.8 per cent in november			2
the federal deficit , while shrinking year - on - year from an all - time high in 2009 , is projected to explode again after 2016 because of the growth of health care , @entity142 , and @entity144 spending			0
the years of president @entity0 's presidency have seen more added to the national debt than in all the other presidential administrations combined			1
dwarfing the class - warfare fight : for every @entity3 who ranks income inequality as the most pressing @entity3 issue , 19 put healthcare at the top of their lists @entity0 pivoted away from @entity17 and his health insurance overhaul law , pointing to an economic agenda that he hopes captures @entity3 ' imagination -- and distracts them from his administration 's missteps the @entity8 told reporters that 400 people attended the president 's speech , which was hosted by the @entity24 , a far - left think tank founded by former clinton white house chief of staff @entity86			1
it has drawn the ire of progressive purists for accepting funding from giant corporations including @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177			0
by the 15 - minute mark of @entity0 's 50 - minute , 6,575 - word address , only one of the three major @entity3 cable news networks – the liberal - leaning @entity182 – was still broadcasting it live			1
both @entity184 and the @entity185 switched to other programming .			0

*gallup* polls show income inequality hardly registers on @entity3 ' worry - meter
the top concerns of @entity3 – dissatisfaction with government , the national deficit , unemployment and healthcare – are @entity0 's weak spots
@entity0 's speech wednesday ran so long that two out of the three major @entity3 cable news channels stopped covering it *mid-way* through
