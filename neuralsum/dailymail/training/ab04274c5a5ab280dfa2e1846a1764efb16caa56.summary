by @entity0 published : 20:49 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 03:16 est , 19 november 2013 the deputy prime minister revealed chancellor @entity2 is actively considering imposing @entity3 on foreign oligarchs foreigners blamed for inflating the @entity8 property market are set to be hit with new tax raid , @entity5 indicated yesterday			1
the deputy prime minister revealed chancellor @entity2 is actively considering imposing @entity3 on foreign oligarchs , who are currently exempt from the charge when they sell a home in the @entity15			1
@entity15 homeowners are only exempt from the levy on their main property			1
basic rate taxpayers pay 18 per cent , while higher rate payers pay 28 per cent			1
mr @entity5 said foreign millionaires should prepare to pay more since they are fuelling a housing boom which is pricing @entity15 customers out of the market in large parts of the capital			1
he said : ‘ we certainly need to make sure that people who invest very large amounts of money into property in central @entity8 locations , which more often than not then stand empty , pay their fair share of tax in those transactions			2
‘ that ’s why we are looking at things like a differential application of capital gains tax to those transactions			0
’ blaming foreign investors for the house price boom , the deputy prime minister added : ‘ there are parts of the @entity8 property market which are entirely divorced , dislocated , from the rest of the economy , certainly the rest of @entity8 ’s economy , and still more from the rest of the nation ’s economy			1
that ’s partly because they are driven by market forces which are global			0
’ mr @entity5 said ‘ decisions have not yet been made ’ about changing the rules on @entity3			2
but senior coalition sources say the plans are highly likely to be unveiled in the @entity61 next month			0
another option would be for mr @entity2 to increase the rate of stamp duty charged on the sale of expensive properties			1
last year , he increased to 7 per cent the stamp duty charged on the purchase of homes worth more than £ 2m and closed down loopholes that allowed buyers to avoid stamp duty by putting their homes into corporate ' envelopes '			0
mr @entity2 was willing to do a deal on a @entity75 , but @entity76 has repeatedly blocked it to avoid upsetting rich @entity79 donors the chancellor needs cash to fund two party conference spending commitments : the @entity79 plans for a marriage tax allowance , which costs £ 600m and a @entity85 promise to give free school meals to all infants			2
@entity89 and @entity85 sources say the @entity3 move is ‘ not a huge revenue raiser ’ but it is seen as a low risk move that will show voters the coalition is serious about making the rich pay and levelling the playing field between @entity15 and foreign investors			1
mr @entity5 again repeated calls for new property taxes and made clear that the @entity85 will continue to argue for a mansion tax on properties worth £ 2m or more or new @entity103 bands on high value properties			0
but his aides conceded there is little prospect of convincing senior @entity108 to back the plans			0
mr @entity2 was willing to do a deal on a @entity75 , but @entity76 has repeatedly blocked it to avoid upsetting rich @entity79 donors			2
‘ they have set their faces against it , ’ the @entity85 said			0
‘ does anyone think it ’s reasonable that if you live in a family home worth £ 700,000 in @entity118 you ’re paying the same council tax as a millionaire in a £ 40 million mansion ? ‘ we have a significant number of property taxes but for reasons of history and accident , or downright prejudice on the part of my conservative colleagues , who simply do n’t want to ask people in very high value properties to pay a bit of extra , we ’re saying to hard pressed families : “ you have to pay property tax but someone in a multimillion pound mansion down the road does n’t			2
” ' that strikes me as unfair			0
’ treasury sources refused to comment on ‘ speculation about the @entity61 statement ’ but pointed out that the chancellor has ‘ already taken action in this area ’ .			0
