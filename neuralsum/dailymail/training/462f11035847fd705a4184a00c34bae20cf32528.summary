by @entity0 for much of human history , people have attempted to find the elixir of life			2
and now , scientists believe they have found a chemical that could eventually get them one step closer to unlocking the secret to eternal youth			0
they discovered that a supplement used by bodybuilders could increase life expectancy			1
a supplement used by bodybuilders could increase life expectancy , new research suggests ( file picture ) a study revealed @entity19 ( alpha - ketoglutarate ) increases the life expectancy of roundworms by up to 50 per cent			1
and , scientists say this finding is offering new hope of an anti-ageing drug for humans			0
the supplement is used to reach peak athletic performance and it can also help treat erectile dysfunction			0
but now , researchers say the chemical - which is involved in the metabolic pathway that generates energy - seems to delay ageing in a similar way to being on a diet			1
the discovery , reported online in the journal nature , could suggest new strategies for the prevention and treatment of age - related diseases			1
dieting has been shown to improve longevity and stave off diseases in a range of organisms - including humans			0
one study found reducing calorie intake by only 10 per cent could make people live longer			0
and now , it seems @entity19 mimics dieting by helping people burn fat			2
drugs or gene therapy that disrupt nutrient or energy metabolism can also provide similar benefits , but although several chemicals that regulate ageing have been found , the details of how they work are unclear			2
the latest experiments on the tiny lab worm @entity67 showed @entity19 delays ageing - and determines the mechanism by which it imparts these effects			1
@entity19 can increase the life expectancy of the worm , @entity67 ( pictured ) by up to 50 per cent the worm - the first animal to have its entire dna mapped - has been widely used in studies of ageing and lifespan			1
worms are useful for studying ageing as they only have a life expectancy of two to three weeks so the effects of supplements can be established quickly			1
despite its small size , more than a third of the worms ’ genes are also the same as humans ’ - and many mutants are already known to lengthen lifespan			0
the researchers said @entity19 acts on an energy producing protein to produce a body state that is the same as being on a diet			1
taking @entity19 extends lifespan in the worms by regulating energy metabolism - and this could offer a target for therapeutic intervention			2
professor @entity104 , of the @entity105 in @entity106 , said : ‘ metabolism and ageing are intimately linked			0
‘ dietary restriction consistently extends lifespan and delays age - related diseases in evolutionarily diverse organisms			1
‘ similar conditions of nutrient limitation and genetic or pharmacological perturbations of nutrient or energy metabolism also have longevity benefits			0
here we show @entity19 extends the lifespan of adult caenorhabditis elegans			2
‘ our analyses uncover new molecular links between a common metabolite , a universal cellular energy generator and dietary restriction in the regulation of lifespan suggesting new strategies for the prevention and treatment of ageing and age - related diseases			1
’ while it could take years to extend lives dramatically the study raises the prospect of humans one day simply popping pills to live longer			0
she said : ‘ longevity molecules that delay ageing and extend lifespan have long been a dream of humanity			0
‘ metabolites such as @entity19 that can alter c elegans ’ lifespan suggest an internal mechanism may exist that is accessible to intervention			2
‘ whether this can translate into manipulating the ageing process in humans remains to be seen			0

@entity19 increases the life expectancy of roundworms by up to 50 per cent
it does this by delaying ageing in a way similar to being on a diet
it is not known exactly how it works but the discovery could eventually lead to the development of a pill to prevent age - related illnesses
