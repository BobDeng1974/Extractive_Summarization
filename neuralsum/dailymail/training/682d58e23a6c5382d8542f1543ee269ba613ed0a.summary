the iconic cereal brand is hoping to crack the overseas market by adapting the traditional cereal to the @entity10 preference for savoury tastes he said : ‘ we ’re having a think about what we ’d add to @entity2 to make it savoury			1
‘ in the same way as we ’ve added chocolate chips or golden syrup or banana to cereals here , you could add other savoury flavours , like green tea , sesame seeds , cranberries and other fruits			1
’ while the plans were still in their early stages , the research department in the @entity44 is currently working with the flavour houses in @entity10 and consumer panels to test the flavours , he said			2
