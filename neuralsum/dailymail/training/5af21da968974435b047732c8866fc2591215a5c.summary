but now the money has gone and he has been forced to take a job in a biscuit factory for just £ 204 a week			1
his ignominious journey from rags to riches and back again has included squandering money on fast cars , huge quantities and drugs and drink and has even included two spells in prison			1
divorced from his wife , @entity21 , the man dubbed the ‘ lotto lout ’ has now had to move north to @entity5 to be near his 10 - year - old daughter , @entity23			1
and at one stage he was so broke he was forced to sleep rough in a forest while looking for work			2
but despite the wasted money , the stints behind bars and the broken marriage , @entity2 , 30 , - who styled himself as the @entity28 - says he is happier now			1
he said : ‘ i moved to @entity5 to be closer to @entity23 and to get out of my drinking - friends said the drink and drugs would have killed me within six months and i ’ve been clean of drugs for over two years			1
‘ i ’d had 10 years of doing what a rock star does and i had to sort myself out so i decided to head up to @entity5 and it ’s great – i love it up here			0
‘ in @entity41 i crashed on a mate ’s sofa but i ’ve got a two - bedroom council flat just outside @entity45 so i ’m well sorted			2

by february 2010 , he was declared bankrupt and was back on @entity67 after admitted blowing the fortune			2
today @entity2 has swapped high rock star lifestyle for a hairnet and white overalls to turn out tartan tins of shortbread at the @entity75 factory in @entity45 , @entity76			1
lifestyle change : @entity2 now lives in @entity5 and works packing and stacking shortbread write caption here tattooed @entity2 , who has shed five stone after taking part in a tv fitness documentary , said : ‘ i get £ 204 every week for packing and stacking shortbread and cookies and i love it			1
i treasure those wages more than any £ 9million fortune			0
‘ i ’ve got all i need so this is a new start for me			0
when i first moved up i was in a tent for a week in the woods because i had nowhere to go and had n’t started at the factory			0
‘ sitting there in the woods was when i first thought i could sort myself out properly			0
’ two months ago he got a job as a packer with @entity75 and now works a six - hour shift , five days a week with more than 200 colleagues on the production line , boxing up biscuits and shortbread			1
the products are then shipped off around the world			0

i ’m definitely happier because i ’m back to reality			0
a few people recognised me when i started but everyone ’s been brilliant			0
i had lots of questions about the money in the first few days and where it all went			0
‘ i said i was a 19 - year - old d * * * head who went nuts – what teenager would n’t ? but now i ’m 30 it ’s time to grow up			0
i love the work – i could n’t sit here on benefits			0
he says he cycles almost everywhere after being banned for drink - driving and enjoys nothing better than playing games on his x-box in the evening			1
he said : ‘ i used to arrange banger - racing in the field behind my mansion but these days i just play @entity136 and grid 2 on my x-box			0
@entity2 said he still plays the lottery but says he would spend the mney on helping others if he won again			2
he said : ‘ the only thing i ’ve won recently is my life back			0
but if i won £ 9million again i ’d help kids on drugs – then emigrate to @entity146 , buy some properties , rent them out and sit back and wait on the money to come in			2
do n’t get me wrong , though – i ’d still have a few parties			0
