by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 published : 12:39 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 13:42 est , 7 march 2014 the ‘ spoiled ’ cheerleader fighting a bitter law suit against her parents previously threatened to sue a teacher for kicking her out of the @entity9 dance because he thought she was drunk			1
senior tutor @entity11 spotted @entity12 out in the parking lot with a group of boys – including her boyfriend @entity16 – and thought they were acting suspiciously			2
earlier in the evening @entity12 , now 18 , had apparently been hard loudly boasting that she had @entity18 , a brand of vodka			2
entitled : @entity12 , left , threatened to sue her school after she was kicked out of her @entity22 because she was strongly suspected of being drunk of vodka bragging : @entity12 was heard bragging by teachers that she had a bottle of @entity18			1
they searched her car , did n't find any and the teacher who hauled her into an office was convinced she was drunk above the law : @entity12 , pictured in her @entity34 dress , felt she had a case against the teacher she was hauled into a school office and questioned while teachers searched the car she had been standing near			1
they did n’t find any alcohol and she was cleared of drinking , but in tuesday ’s court hearing a lawyer representing @entity12 ’s parents @entity46 and @entity47 revealed mr @entity48 had told them he was convinced she was drunk and would have been able to prove it ‘ if he ’d had a breathalizer ’			1
despite that @entity12 was insistent she was completely innocent – even though she was suspended for two days in the aftermath of the incident			2
she was so angry that , according to her parents , she started to threaten legal action against mr @entity11			0
in court documents seen by @entity59 , @entity46 wrote : ‘ @entity12 also had starting threatening filing a lawsuit against mr. @entity11 from @entity61 for making her miss her @entity22 ’			1
explaining the incident she went on : ‘ on october 12 , 2013 we were contacted by @entity61 , and spoke with mr @entity11 , who advised us that @entity12 was suspected of drinking and had been heard bragging loudly , inside the @entity34 , and having ‘ @entity65 ’ , a grain of vodka alcohol			1
‘ mr @entity11 relayed to us that @entity12 had been seen in the parking lot with her boyfriend and several other boys acting in a suspicious manner , which caused the @entity61 authorities to search their vehicle			2
she added : ‘ mr @entity11 also related to us that they had discovered plans for a post-homecoming dance alcohol party , presumably at our house , hosted by @entity12			2
not impressed : the judge hearing her claim that her parents should pay her school fees and maintenance even though she refuses to live by their rules took a very dim view of her case support : @entity85 is pictured with @entity12 at her hearing this week			1
the powerful attorney is funding her case and letting her stay at his mansion ‘ @entity12 was suspended for this behavior for two days by @entity61 , being placed on probation for the rest of the fall semester and not being allowed to participate in the @entity94 because of her behavior			2
’ @entity12 ’s version of events was very different			0
she wrote : ‘ there was an incident where i was accused of being intoxicated at my high school ’s homecoming dance			2
i was found not to be intoxicated			0
’ but her alleged reaction to threaten legal action seems to demonstrate the kind of mentality that has led her to sue her parents for maintenance , college bills and legal fees , after claiming they abandoned her			2
she even went on to allege that her mother was the cause of her bulimia because she called her ' porky ' and that her father had an ' inappropriate affection ' for her			0
however , mrs @entity12 said the girl developed a ' hatred ' for her mother because all she did was try to get her treatment for her eating disorder			0
and a @entity120 investigation cleared mr @entity121 of any claims of abuse , with @entity12 's parents claiming an official assigned to the case came to the conclusion she was just ' spoiled '			1
her pleas for immediate financial assistance were denied in a hearing at @entity131 on tuesday , but judge @entity132 set a trial date for april 22			0
@entity12 ’s controversial legal battle is being funded by the father of her best friend , millionaire lawyer @entity85			1
the @entity137 believe he is enabling their daughter ’s behavior and encouraging her to take the matter to court			0
she is currently living in their large mansion in @entity145 , @entity2			0
war : @entity46 and @entity121 are n't just fighting with their daughter , but the @entity150 - in whose home they claim @entity12 had her first drink - and with the parents of her boyfriend @entity16 princess : @entity12 even accused her mother of being the cause of her bulimia , claiming that mrs @entity12 had called her ' porky ' and ' fat '			1
mrs @entity121 because she tried to help , @entity12 developed a ' hatred ' towards her @entity121 wrote : ‘ the fact the @entity85 family has subsidized a lawsuit , rather than providing responsible guidance in abiding by a parent ’s rules is not an acceptable society norm			1
’ yesterday we revealed the parents claim in court papers that @entity85 , the managing partner at @entity171 , @entity172 & @entity173 and a member of gov. @entity176 ’s @entity175 – allegedly allowed @entity12 to drink in his house			1
apparently when @entity12 was a 15 - year - old freshman she got so drunk on vodka at @entity85 ’s home that she was sick all over the sidewalk and into a garbage can after her dad @entity47 picked her up for a basketball game			1
and according to the @entity121 family , @entity85 ’s wife @entity183 gave @entity12 and her friends wine coolers in the back of a limo bound for @entity189 on her daughter ’s 15th birthday			1
in an excerpt from explosive court documents , @entity47 – a retired police chief from @entity1 – wrote : ‘ the @entity85 household , according to @entity12 in the past , is more lenient			1
she would often tell us how the @entity171 parents would allow alcoholic parties to be held at their house …			0
‘ @entity12 ’s first time drinking alcohol was at the @entity171 house , in march of 2011 and on other occasions including their daughter ’s 15th birthday where they have freely provided alcohol			1
‘ @entity12 came home bragging saying that during the limo ride to @entity189 , mrs @entity206 gave all the girls wine coolers to drink			2
this type of behavior we did not condone			0
’ the war of words between the @entity150 and the @entity137 is not the only family feud to have developed during the bitter legal dispute			0
on wednesday @entity59 exclusively revealed that the parents of @entity12 ’s boyfriend @entity16 are furious the @entity137 are blaming him for making her ‘ obsessed with alcohol ’ and getting her suspended from school			1
corrupting ? @entity16 , right , has been accused of leading @entity12 astray with drink , parties and even getting her suspended from her @entity61 in @entity2 they also dragged his dad @entity222 and mom @entity223 into the battle , saying they regularly brought the boozed - up pair home well after curfew , turning up at 3.30am on one occasion			1
they gave @entity12 an ultimatum that she had to either split up with her boyfriend , or move out			0
in one exchange between the @entity235 girl and her father last november she wrote : ' well i 'm not coming home if i ca n't see him '			0
@entity12 refused to dump @entity16 and actually moved in with his family for two nights , before relocating to the @entity242			0
but @entity243 defended his son and his wife , @entity223			0
he said : ‘ my son has been painted in a questionable light by some of the comments from the @entity137			0
' their only experience of him is that he met the father long enough to shake hands			0
that 's the only interaction they have ever had			0
they made their decision about him from that			0
' if you read the court papers you can see the trend is with every boyfriend she 's had it 's always the boyfriend who 's the bad influence			1
we have been dragged into this			0
’ @entity12 ’s chances of winning against her parents look slim after tuesday ’s initial hearing , especially after her pleas for immediate financial aid were shot down in flames by @entity277			2
he was incredibly vocal in his criticism of the high school student			0
after reading an expletive - laden and vicious answerphone message left by @entity12 , from @entity1 , @entity2 to her mother , in which the girl said : ' i wan na s * * * all over your face ' , he said : ' have you ever in your experience seen such gross disrespect for a parent ? i do n’t see it in my house			1
’ if looks could kill : @entity85 's children @entity292 , left , and @entity293 , right , glower at @entity12 's father , @entity47			1
the @entity137 claim their daughter once came back from a party at the @entity171 house so drunk she vomited on the sidewalk the judge added that @entity12 had given her mom and dad : ‘ the proverbial f you ’			1
he also warned he must consider the ' slippery slope ' where ' we open the gates for a 12 - year - old to sue for an @entity309 , a 13 - year - old to sue for an @entity310 … what about a 15 - year - old asking for a 60 inch tv ?
