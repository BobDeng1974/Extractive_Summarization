it is now hoped the studies will help lead to countermeasures for illness by @entity5 published : 12:46 est , 3 april 2013 updated : 01:58 est , 4 april 2013 there are some spectacular images captured by astronauts in outer space			1
but these images of inner space , of human cells taken on the @entity14 , offer a truly unique insight of how the body reacts in orbit			1
this image , titled ' @entity19 ' by scientists , reveals a monocyte immune cell as a translucent , burnt - orange vision flecked with green			1
the internal structure of a human cell in simulated gravity taken on the @entity14			1
pictured here is a monocyte immune cell that plays an integral role in protecting our bodies from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses to record this image , immune cells were placed on gold - coated slides inside @entity39 ? s @entity41 incubator			2
as the cells grew they removed the gold , allowing researchers on @entity46 to measure their movements in space			2
antibodies that light up under a fluorescence microscope were added to reveal colours and identify specific proteins			0
the human cell photo in space was taken under ' simulated gravity ' conditions using the @entity39 's @entity41 incubator , which uses a centrifuge to mimic gravity in the weightlessness of space			1
immune cells were placed on gold - coated slides inside the incubator			2
as the cells migrated they removed the gold , allowing researchers on @entity46 to measure their movements in space			2
the cell picture was taken using the @entity39 's @entity41 incubator			0
it contains a small centrifuge to simulate @entity46 - like gravity to record this image , antibodies that light up under a fluorescence microscope were added to reveal colours and identify specific proteins			0
the @entity39 said : ' some cells , such as those in muscles and our immune system , are mobile			0
' others , such as those in our bones , are fixed			0
' knowing how spaceflight affects the mobility of cells is important for astronauts and mission designers			0
' on earth , cell motility depends on the integrity of the internal cell structure , which is known as the cytoskeleton			0
researchers from the @entity98 , @entity100 ’s @entity99 and @entity101 found that cytoskeleton changes in weightlessness lead to reduced motility			0
this process may be one of the reasons why astronauts suffer from weakened immune systems when living in space , the @entity39 said			1
it added : ' humans bodies have evolved to live on @entity113 gravity			0
astronauts ’ bodies adapt to living in weightlessness in many ways			1
' comparing human cells in weightlessness and simulated gravity in space allows researchers to understand how gravity affects the inner working of our bodies , which may help to prepare astronauts for further exploration of our @entity129			1

pictures taken on @entity14 under ' simulated gravity '
many astronauts suffer from weakened immune systems when living in space
it is now hoped the studies will help lead to countermeasures for illness
