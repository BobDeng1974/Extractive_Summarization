@entity0 is a prop and a born - and - bred @entity2 stalwart , so making a song and dance about having neck surgery is not the done thing			1
he settles for : ‘ it ’s not ideal			2
’ no fuss — as ever			2
the 27 - year - old broke off from preparations for the @entity2 ’ @entity12 clash with holders @entity13 at @entity14 on sunday to reflect on his decimated year and he was typically matter of fact , despite the extreme circumstances			1
having become a fixture up front for his club and for @entity21 , and having shown remarkable physical resilience at the sharp end of the scrum duel on a weekly basis , @entity0 ’s serene progress was abruptly and worryingly interrupted at the start of this year			1
a loss of power alerted medics to a problem which turned out to be very serious			2
@entity0 ( right ) made his comeback from neck surgery in november , earlier than scheduled @entity2 prop @entity0 talks to @entity34 's @entity33 during a break in preparations for match against @entity13 @entity0 missed most of the year after he required surgery on a bulging disc in his neck he said : ‘ i had a stiff neck after we played @entity43 in the @entity12			1
when i woke up the next morning i was even more stiff than usual			0
i went away with @entity21 and played a couple of @entity45 but when it got to the third week i tried to do a bench press in the gym and basically had no power in my left arm			0
that flagged up something neural so i was sent off for a scan which showed i had a bulging disc in my neck			1
‘ you do n’t really want to have surgery on your neck so i went to the specialist , who recommended three months of rest			1
i did that but it did n’t really do anything so they operated in may			0
it was meant to be a six - month recovery period but i ’ve come back a bit quicker			0
’ having made his return ahead of schedule last month , @entity0 insists he feels ‘ better than ever ’ following his extended break			1
but being forced to address the grim fact that his job had caused spinal damage was not a comfortable process			0
@entity0 said that he was nervous about his return , but only that he would be rubbish after the lengthy lay - off the @entity21 international said he ' feels better than ever ' after rest and rehabilitation ‘ it ’s not ideal , ’ he said			1
‘ i understand the forces that come through your neck			2
you do n’t want to mess around with it			0
but a fair few people have had the surgery i had			2
the surgeon has operated on most of the @entity2 team ! he ’s done @entity88 ’ back , @entity90 ’s neck , @entity91 ’s neck , @entity92 ’s neck ... seeing them come back and play , you know you ’ll be all right			1
it ’s reassuring because it ’s your livelihood			0
’ rest and rehab was a new and unwelcome scenario for @entity0			1
the disruption to his daily routine was hard to take			0
there was little motivation to climb out of bed in the mornings			0
he would go to the club , watch video footage of matches , sit in on team meetings and enjoy a free lunch			0
in hindsight , he admits he could have made better use of his time off but he did n’t know then just how much of it he would have			2
‘ i was n’t doing weights and you ca n’t really do any rehab on your neck at that point because they do n’t want you to activate your neck muscles , so it was … boring — massively boring , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ everyone says , “ why do n’t you go away travelling ? ” but you ca n’t just go abroad for three months			2
i ’m not really a beach person anyway ! ’ @entity0 gets stuck into the scrum during the @entity128 match between @entity2 and @entity129 @entity0 sat out @entity21 's summer tour of @entity131 and admitted it was difficult to watch the slog of rehab has been worthwhile			1
having spent a lot of time this year helping @entity2 ’s other props , notably @entity137 and @entity138 , @entity0 began to focus on his own game again			1
due to carefully monitored resumption of contact work , he had no concerns about subjecting his neck to set - piece pressure again , but he was slightly on edge before his comeback in the 29 - 13 @entity147 win against sale on november 9			1
‘ before the game there was a bit of nervousness , not about the neck but about being rubbish ! ’ he said			1
‘ you ’ve been out for 10 months and you do n’t have a clue			2
thankfully , i got thrown straight into a scrum and after that you ’re on auto - pilot			0
you just get on with it			0
since then i ’ve played 65 minutes and 80 minutes			0
’ @entity0 had been missed by the @entity2 , with director of rugby @entity160 suggesting that his @entity162 at @entity163 spreads ‘ fear in opposition teams ’			1
@entity21 have also felt the loss of their premier tighthead , although @entity168 has done a sterling job in his absence			0
the 27 - year - old has been capped 45 times for @entity21 and he knows a return to the squad is not guaranteed @entity0 is tackled by @entity176 's @entity175 during the @entity178 match in february this year for his part , @entity0 found it tough to watch the national team ’s june tour of @entity131 from afar			1
‘ it was difficult because i wanted to be involved , ’ he said			0
‘ i was sat on my backside , doing nothing , feeling a bit sad because i was sat on the sofa , watching @entity21 play			0
’ in recent weeks , @entity21 ’s forwards stood tall against their rivals from the southern hemisphere , despite losses against @entity131 and @entity193			0
@entity0 feels that the @entity195 pack is now one of the leading set - piece units in the world and he knows that his return to the starting xv for the @entity178 will be no foregone conclusion			1
but that personal battle can wait			0
sunday 's clash with @entity13 will be a club match with the intensity and class of an international			0
‘ you can come across international packs at club level , but it ’s very rare you come across an international squad from 1 - 23 , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it could be as good as a test match and knowing the way the @entity176 play , it ’s potentially more forward - dominated , so in some ways , it could be tougher than a test match			0
’ @entity0 will relish that challenge			2
he has a chance to end his less - than - ideal year in fine style .			2

@entity0 had surgery in may after scans revealed bulging disc in his neck
the issue was *spotted* earlier in the year but three months rest did not help
