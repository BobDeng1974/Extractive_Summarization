in its quest to bring home the last remaining captive solider from @entity5 , the @entity1 administration reportedly did not follow standard detainee release procedures and ignored concerns voiced by the intelligence community that the inmates selected for the trade may be too dangerous			1
the release of @entity13 militants from @entity14 in exchange for army sgt @entity16 was orchestrated by president @entity1 's national security team comprised of @entity21 , @entity19 and @entity20 officials			1
' there was no dissent on moving forward with this plan , ' @entity23 @entity22 told @entity27			0
an official familiar with the interagency discussions told the publication there were members of the @entity1 administration and the @entity19 who argued that the military should ' suck it up and salute ’ on this controversial issue			1
by all accounts , president @entity1 was determined to secure @entity53 's release after five years of captivity			1
the idea to swap the kidnapped soldier for enemy combatants first came about in january 2009 , when then - newly elected president @entity1 ordered the @entity58 to assess all 240 @entity14 detainees and select candidates for a potential prisoner exchange			1
the review found the five @entity64 fighters too high - risk to be released because they were likely to return to the fight against @entity67 forces in @entity5			1
' these five are clearly bad dudes , ' an official told @entity27			0
the @entity1 administration has formed the @entity71 to debate and handle the release of detainees from the military prison in @entity75			2
over the past five years , the group made up of @entity21 , @entity19 , @entity77 and the @entity20 officials has signed off on 82 detainee releases			0
the fate of the five @entity64 militants , identified as @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , has been the subject of heated and recurring debates in the intelligence community			1
celebration : a pro-taliban website has published a video that claims to show @entity64 detainees arriving in @entity94 after being released from @entity14 as part of a prisoner exchange the @entity97 and some officials in the @entity19 saw the release of the high - risk detainees as the cornerstone of a possible peace agreement with the @entity64 more than a decade in the making			1
those who opposed the plan , however , pointed to top secret intelligence showing that the @entity107 posed a serious threat to @entity67 interests , @entity27 reported			2
in the months leading up to the prisoner swap , the @entity1 administration and its supporters allegedly pressured officials on the other side of the debate to come up with evidence proving that the @entity14 inmates were , in fact , dangerous			1
until this year , a law passed by the @entity121 - controlled @entity120 required the @entity1 administration to meet a set of stringent conditions in order to release anyone from @entity14			1
but a few months ago , @entity127 senator @entity126 was able to weaken the certification standards , allowing prisoners to be set free if it benefited national security			0
prisoner swap : @entity133 , left , and @entity83 , right , have been freed from @entity14 former combatants : the prisoners , including @entity85 , left , and @entity84 , right , will remain in @entity94 for at least next year as part of the terms of their release released : @entity82 is believed to have been at the command of a mass killing , and the @entity141 has sought his prosecution for war crimes this week , the @entity14 quintet were shipped off to @entity145 , @entity94 , where they are expected to remain for a year before being allowed to return home to @entity5			1
president @entity1 promised tuesday that the @entity67 will be keeping an eye on the @entity5 ' movements , but a @entity150 official stated that the former inmates will be allowed to roam the country free			1
following the deal that freed @entity53 , the last @entity67 soldier held in @entity5 , concerns have been expressed by some @entity67 intelligence officials and congressional advisers over the role of the @entity158 as a bridge between @entity160 and the world of radical @entity107			2
the @entity150 official said the @entity64 men , who have been granted @entity94 residency permits , will not be treated like prisoners while in @entity145 and no @entity67 officials will be involved in monitoring their movement while in the country			1
‘ under the deal they have to stay in @entity94 for a year and then they will be allowed to travel outside the country ... they can go back to @entity5 if they want to , ’ the official said			2
speaking during a press conference in @entity177 tuesday , president @entity1 defended the prisoner swap , saying that the @entity67 had an obligation not to leave any of its service members behind			1
' is there a possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us ? absolutely , ' @entity1 told reporters			0
' that 's been true of all the prisoners that were released from @entity14			2
there 's a certain recidivism rate that takes place			0
' but he then added : ' i would n't be doing it if i thought that it was contrary to @entity67 national security			0
' the five traded @entity14 inmates include former ministers in the @entity64 government , commanders and one man who had direct ties to the @entity207 chief @entity206			2
the prisoner exchange has been scrutinized by @entity121 leaders , especially in light of revelations that @entity53 may have deserted his post in 2009 before he was taken captive			0
senator @entity213 described the @entity64 militants as the ' hardest of the hard core			0
' ‘ these are the highest high - risk people			1
others that we have released have gone back into the fight , ’ said @entity213			0
days after his rescue , @entity16 ( pictured in a video released by the @entity64 in 2010 ) was in stable condition at a @entity67 military hospital in @entity225 the @entity21 concluded in 2010 that @entity16 walked away from his unit , and , after an initial flurry of searching , the military curbed any high - risk rescue plans @entity67 defense secretary @entity230 said he hoped the exchange might lead to breakthroughs in reconciliation with the militants and rejected accusations from @entity121 that it resulted from negotiations with terrorists , saying the swap had been worked out by the government of @entity94			1
‘ we did n't negotiate with terrorists , ’ @entity241 said in an interview on @entity244 's @entity243			0
‘ as i said and explained before , sergeant @entity16 was a prisoner of war			0
that 's a normal process in getting your prisoners back			0
’ @entity16 , 28 , was handed over on saturday to @entity67 forces who had flown in by helicopter			0
the @entity64 said they had released @entity16 near the border with @entity254 in eastern @entity5			0
@entity67 officials said the restrictions placed on the five @entity5 militants included monitoring of their activities			2
those assurances were greeted with scepticism by @entity67 republicans and some @entity5 officials , who voiced concerns that the men would rejoin the insurgency			2
in @entity160 , some @entity121 suggested the administration had bypassed a legal requirement to notify @entity120 30 days in advance about prisoner releases from @entity14 and said the deal amounted to a negotiation with terrorists			2
@entity121 senator @entity121 of @entity274 called it a ‘ dangerous price ’ to pay			0
but @entity1 's national security adviser , @entity277 , said the administration was concerned about @entity16 's health and did not have 30 days to wait in light of the urgent situation			2
some members of the @entity120 worried even before the prisoner exchange took place over the release of the five			0
@entity21 documents released by @entity287 said all five were sent to @entity14 in 2002			0
they were classified as ‘ high - risk ’ and ‘ likely to pose a threat ’ to the @entity67 , its interests and allies			1
from left , sen. @entity293 , @entity294 , @entity296 vice chairman sen. @entity295 , @entity297 , and @entity299 minority leader @entity298 of @entity300 , disparage the decision to swap sgt. @entity303 for high - level @entity64 militants president @entity1 defended his decision to release five detainees from @entity14 in exchange for @entity309 sgt. @entity16 , saying today that the country had an obligation to not leave military personnel behind republicans in @entity120 criticized the agreement and complained about not having been consulted about the terms of @entity16 's release			1
members of the @entity318 said the @entity21 notified the panel by phone on saturday that the exchange was occurring in the next five hours .			0

@entity1 administration viewed release of five militants as first step toward peace deal with @entity64
@entity58 review from 2009 found the @entity64 leaders were too high - risk to be released

@entity150 official said @entity64 fighters wo n't be treated as prisoners while living in @entity94 , and no @entity67 officials will be *tracking* them
it 's ' absolutely ' possible the prisoners the @entity67 released form @entity14 could rejoin terrorist cells , president @entity1 said today
@entity1 suggested that he did not violate *federal* law by making the trade without congressional *approval*
