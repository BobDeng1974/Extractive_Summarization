@entity1 has been dropped as a @entity2 because of her ' difficult reputation ' , it has been claimed			1
the @entity5 supermodel , who is married to @entity7 actor @entity6 with whom she shares two - year - old son @entity8 , has been let go as one of the main faces of the lingerie brand after her $ 1 million , three year - contract ' was not renewed '			1
have her wings been clipped ? @entity1 in the 2012 @entity2 catwalk show in @entity15 in november a source told @entity18 's @entity17 that the 29 - year - old beauty ' has a difficult reputation ' and suggested it was the main reason she will no longer walk the company 's star - studded annual catwalk show wearing a prestigious pair of angel 's wings , an honour reserved for just a handful of the brand 's top faces			2
another source suggested the brunette model is ' not a big seller for @entity2 ' , compared to its other @entity34 like @entity35 , 31 , @entity36 , 24 , and @entity37 , 31			1
@entity1 will reportedly still walk in the company 's runway show later this year and will also appear in its catalogue			2
frosty ? sources claim the model is n't very friendly with her fellow @entity34 the source said : ' they can still use her for catalogue , where she will get a day rate , but she does n't have to be an @entity48 to do that			1
' a separate insider tells people she is known in the industry as a diva , adding : ' she can be difficult at shoots and appearances			2
she 's not very timely			2
she 's standoffish with the rest of the girls			1
' but one source added : ' if @entity1 and @entity62 's @entity61 part ways it 's not because of her behaviour			0
she 'll be coming back for the show but it 's unclear if she 'll be in future campaigns			0
but she is definitely one of the most popular models and in high demand			1
' keeping his cool : @entity1 's husband @entity6 was spotted in @entity74 - without his wife - on wednesday executives from @entity2 did not deny that @entity1 's contract has not been renewed , but chief marketing officer @entity78 insisted he has already invited her to walk in the 2013 runway show in @entity15 in november			0
he said : ' @entity1 is one of the best models in the history of the business - and easily one of the most popular			1
she is also a consummate professional			0
' ' any rumours to the contrary are simply untrue			0
while her international commitments have kept her away from us more than we ’d like over the past few years , she will always be an @entity48 to me … in fact , i ’ve already invited her to walk the runway in this year ’s fashion show and , happily , she ’s agreed			0
' other @entity34 include @entity93 , 27 , @entity94 , 20 , @entity95 , 28 , and @entity96 24			0
