a predicted rise in pests could cause vast bread and potato shortages and force the nation to change its diet , scientists claim			1
according to a study , @entity9 ’s farms could be ‘ overwhelmed ’ by pests within the next 30 years and the risk to crops has been ‘ significantly underestimated ’			1
one in ten pest types are already present in half the world ’s crop - producing countries			0
however this is set to increase dramatically as a result of climate change and inadequate biosecurity measures meant to protect species from disease			1
researchers predict a rise in pests could cause vast bread and potato shortages and force nation change diet and researchers at the @entity29 say the @entity9 is particularly vulnerable having ‘ significantly underestimated ’ the risk that crop pests pose to crops including wheat and potatoes			1
the study forecasts that factors including climate change , inadequate biosecurity measures and other new variants will help pests spread in the next three decades			1
professor @entity40 , of the @entity29 and @entity41 , said : ‘ the @entity9 has significantly underestimated the scale of the threat			2
‘ this is a huge problem that is lacking in public and political awareness			0
‘ people are absolutely paralysed with fear of diseases like @entity50 , but while they are extremely dangerous , the need to tackle crop diseases is just as pressing			0
‘ we are not spending enough on research , on training , on surveillance and on biosecurity			0
‘ unless we significantly step up our efforts we could be forced to change our diets in the future as crops come and go			0
’ potential threats include fungi , bacteria , viruses and insects , with powdery mildew and leaf blotch posing a danger to wheat			1
items like bread and potatoes are said to be at risk of pests in the @entity9 after threat was ' underestimated ' potatoes are at risk from new variants of @entity79 – the blight which caused the catastrophic @entity82 potato famine of the late 1840s			1
professor @entity40 said that if pests go on to spread at their current rate , then a large proportion of the world ’s biggest food - producing countries will be inundated with pests			2
dr @entity90 , of the @entity29 , who also worked on the report , told the @entity92 this would pose a ‘ grave threat to global food security ’			0
more than one in 10 pest types is already present in about half the crop - growing countries , but that level is set to increase dramatically , the report states			0
a spokesman for the @entity102 said : ‘ we take the issue of plant biosecurity very seriously and have appointed a chief plant health officer to oversee our work			0
' this includes a plant health risk register and biosecurity strategy for the @entity9			2

researchers say @entity9 is particularly vulnerable after underestimating risks
climate change and inadequate biosecurity measures will help pests spread
potential threats include fungi , bacteria , viruses and insects with mildew
