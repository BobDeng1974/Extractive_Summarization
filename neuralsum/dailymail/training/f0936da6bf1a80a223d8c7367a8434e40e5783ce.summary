@entity0 succumbed to a painful 24 - 21 defeat against @entity2 at @entity3 on saturday - their fifth in succession against the @entity2			1
@entity7 's men went ahead early on when @entity8 scored a wonderful try to get his first test score before @entity2 fought back			1
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 all crossed the whitewash for the @entity2 to put the game beyond @entity0 , with the hosts ' late penalty try not being enough to claim victory			1
here , @entity19 looks at five positive things @entity0 learned from the match			1
videos scroll down to watch @entity0 players look dejected during the demoralising defeat against @entity2 at @entity3 @entity0 went in at half time with the lead but ultimately lost out to an impressive @entity2 team 1 ) may can score tries at test level question marks have been raised about the @entity33 winger 's ability to score on the international stage but he answered those with aplomb just four minutes into the encounter at @entity3			1
the 24 - year - old received the ball 30 yards from the tryline but he completely burned @entity41 for pace on the outside before brilliantly finishing in the corner			1
no - one has ever doubted his pace and ability but there had been concerns about whether or not he had the mental capacity to be a test finisher			0
saturday 's try will have given may plenty of confidence and ensures the tricky runner will be given more time to develop into an international - standard wing			0
@entity8 scores a sensational solo try for @entity0 after three minutes at @entity3 may celebrates after his superb try against the @entity2 that saw @entity0 take an early lead may and @entity61 celebrate the opening try of the match between @entity0 and @entity2 2 ) @entity0 's semi-reserve side can push the @entity2 all the way @entity67 's side had been ravaged by injuries this autumn and it was a semi-reserve xv who took to the field at @entity71 on saturday			1
despite that , @entity0 came extremely close to beating the @entity2 and were certainly the better side in the first half			1
once @entity75 replaced the injured @entity76 , @entity0 had their fifth and sixth - choice second rows from last season on the pitch - and neither looked out of place			2
@entity80 was magnificent and @entity75 also showed he has a lot to offer this side			0
with the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 to return - not to mention the possible integration of rugby league convert @entity94 in the future - then @entity0 have an extremely competitive squad which runs deep with talent			2
you need a squad to win a @entity100 , and @entity0 most certainly have more than 30 players worthy of being in the side next year			0
@entity0 had lots of injuries heading into the game yet they still matches the @entity107 toe - for - toe @entity7 's squad has plenty of strength with @entity75 ( right ) coming on in the second row 3 ) @entity112 again proved he is certainly worth his place in the side he has so many critics but the @entity0 captain was magnificent in defeat once more			1
the @entity119 flanker got through an astonishing amount of work and was certainly not out - shone by opposite number @entity12			2
yes , @entity112 is not your archetypal ' openside ' but he does a tremendous and tireless job for @entity0 at @entity126			0
with @entity127 doing the dirty work and @entity129 the bulk of the carrying , @entity0 's back three complement each other extremely well and should retain their places against @entity134 next week			0
@entity0 captain @entity112 proved again that he is a class operator and deserves his place @entity112 ( centre ) led from the front and got through a tremendous amount of work for his side 4 ) @entity67 's men need to be more clinical when they are on top what will frustrate @entity67 and his coaches - as well as the players - more than anything else was that @entity0 did not take their opportunities when they were presented with them			2
@entity0 were tremendous in the first half , particularly in the opening 20 minutes , but they only came away with one try to show for it			0
@entity2 did not make that mistake and , most notably , @entity112 and his troops can look to their opponent 's third try as something to learn from			0
the @entity2 worked through 22 phases before replacement prop @entity13 bundled over the line			2
that is the art of clinical finishing - keep the ball alive and make sure you take your chances			0
this is something @entity0 need to rectify during the @entity167 to build confidence leading up to the @entity100			0
@entity2 were clinical , like for @entity13 's ( centre ) try , and @entity0 must learn from this a spell of pressure for @entity2 saw @entity12 gather the ball and drive over the line at @entity3 5 ) @entity175 's scrum can be a potent weapon going forward in the last 10 minutes @entity0 utterly destroyed @entity2 at the set piece			1
the replacement front row of @entity179 , @entity180 and young @entity181 prop @entity182 - who was playing on the opposite side to where he has been deployed all season - bullied the @entity2 in the scrum			2
a penalty try eventually ensued , albeit too late for @entity0 to win the match , such was their dominance in this area			1
with so many front rowers missing through injury , including the destructive @entity87 , @entity67 and scrummaging coach @entity192 can continue to hone @entity0 's scrum and ensure it will be a useful weapon next autumn			0
@entity0 were dominant in the scrum and won penalties even when their reserves came on going forward @entity0 scrum coach @entity192 will be pleased with the scrum 's success			0

@entity0 lost 24 - 21 to @entity2 at @entity3 on saturday
@entity8 scored first try for hosts who also got penalty try late on
