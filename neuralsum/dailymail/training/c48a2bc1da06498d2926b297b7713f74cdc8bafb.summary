by @entity0 saints : the basement in the home of @entity5 , 65 , and his wife @entity6 , 63 , in @entity7 , @entity2 is dedicated to his favourite club football - mad husbands can be trying			1
they monopolise the tv when matches are on , squander money on memorabilia and bore for @entity14 on subjects such as the transfer market			0
yet all that pales into insignificance compared to what @entity19 has put up with to satisfy her husband @entity21 ’s obsession with @entity1			1
her tale of woe begins in 2001 when @entity21 was about to start building a new family house in the tiny hamlet of @entity7 , in @entity2			1
he heard that his beloved @entity1 , who were moving from their ground , the @entity30 , were auctioning off their fixtures and fittings and decided to go along , hoping to buy some cheap timber			1
while there , two far more interesting items caught @entity21 ’s eye – the deep touch - line dug - out used by managers and reserves , and an 1898 vintage turnstile			1
‘ i found myself bidding , and before i knew it i ’d paid £ 410 for the pair of them , ’ says @entity21 , 65 , who was a mechanical engineer			1
‘ when i got home and told @entity6 , she said , “ what the ’ eck are you going to do with those – grow tomatoes in the dug - out and get people to pay to see them grow ? ” ’ in fact , @entity21 had already worked out a plan			1
he had previously intended the basement of his new house to be a store room			2
but he phoned his architects and told them to make something far more ambitious			0
with the dug - out as the centrepiece , he wanted the room to double as a shrine to the @entity1 and a games room , complete with snooker and darts			1
it would be somewhere to party , watch matches on a big screen and spend time with his sons , @entity70 , 41 , @entity71 , 37 , and @entity21 , 36 – and his daughter , @entity72 , 27			1
by 2004 the house was built , with the dug - out and turnstile taking pride of place in the basement			1
a neighbour , author @entity78 , heard about it and arranged for his friend , legendary former @entity1 manager @entity80 , to give it a grand opening			1
to @entity21 ’s amazement , his basement appeared on @entity86 television news			1
today it has the feel of a miniature museum , its walls lined with items such as the official team sheet from the day @entity1 were promoted to the @entity93 two years ago , signed photos of @entity1 stars past and present , signed shirts , and framed newspaper reports of big games			1
as we sit in the dug - out , i ask him what sparked this obsession			1
pride and joy : the deep touch - line dug - out was used by @entity1 managers and reserves at the club 's old ground , the @entity30 vintage : visitors enter the @entity1 shrine basement through a 1898 turnstile ‘ it all started in about 1960 when i was a lad and my father began taking me to see the @entity1 , ’ recalls @entity21			1
‘ we ’d go to the games on the back of his motorbike and , one day , we passed this white @entity120 with a red stripe on it and i thought it was absolutely fantastic			0
then the driver wound down the window and shouted “ up the @entity1 ” at us			1
my dad said , “ that ’s @entity128 , son – the @entity1 winger			2
” i was hooked for life			0
’ we walk around the wall with the big screen to the snooker room , then pass through the turnstile and head upstairs to the rest of the house			2
score : @entity139 , in @entity7 , @entity2 is on the market for £ 695,000 @entity21 has done well from the property booms of the past 30 years			1
he and @entity6 , 63 , lived in a three - bedroom semi in @entity143 , @entity1 , until 1987 , when they upped sticks to @entity7 to be near her parents			1
they bought a plot of land for £ 500 and built their own house , living in a caravan for a year			2
in 2003 they sold it for £ 375,000 , bought the plot next door and built their present home			2
this house , @entity139 , has an @entity160 feel			0
its wide living room has a bare brick fireplace , matched by a brick serving area in the open - plan kitchen / diner			2
high ceilings , windows and light oak balustrades in the hall create the feel of an atrium , and all the bedrooms are good - sized			2
and there are glorious views over @entity175			0
now the children have left home , the house is too big for the @entity179			2
it is on the market for £ 695,000 and @entity21 plans to build another , smaller house nearby			1
what will become of his beloved dug - out ? ‘ i ’m open to offers if someone wants to buy it , ’ he says			1
@entity188 , 01264 810702 the passion for moving to the country is having an unexpected effect on quiet village life			0
more than 100,000 people are leaving @entity14 cities for life in the countryside each year			0
and as many of them are well - off , can - do individuals , they are having quite an impact on the communities they move to – as sleepy village shows are ousted in favour of far more lively events			2
in @entity206 near @entity207 , villagers have in the past two years put on shows featuring comedian @entity209 , guitar virtuosos @entity210 and @entity212 , 1980s and 1990s stars @entity213 and @entity215 and blues legend @entity216 , to name but a few			0
the @entity218 , as the shows are called , are largely down to @entity219 , an ‘ incomer ’ to the village who has worked in the entertainment industry for years			0
@entity224 , former chairman of the village hall committee , says : ‘ the shows have brought the whole village together and inspired us to apply for and get a £ 500,000 lottery grant to restore the hall			2
’ the @entity230 have also boosted the local housing market			0
‘ about 80 per cent of buyers come from outside @entity235 and can be nervous about moving to a small village , ’ said @entity232 , the local estate agent with @entity233			0
‘ the sessions are living proof that this place is buzzing with life			0
’ the number of village impresarios such as @entity219 is growing			0
typical of their number is former insurance broker @entity245 , who moved to @entity246 in the @entity247 , four miles outside @entity248 , from @entity249 , @entity250 , in 2009			0
no sooner had @entity245 settled into running the village stores than he set about organising folk - rock gigs by two of the country ’s most highly regarded artists – @entity256 and @entity257			0
‘ we sold the 200 tickets for each show almost as soon as they were printed and they were very successful evenings , ’ said @entity219			0
putting on top acts in the village hall originated in @entity264 ’s commuter belt			0
in @entity265 - on - @entity266 , a successful jazz club has been running since 1999			0
it was set up by two local men , @entity270 and @entity271 , fed up with having to run for the last train home when they were enjoying a night at @entity273			0
they decided to arrange for musicians to come to them – and since then @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 and @entity280 have all trodden the creaky boards at the village hall .			0
