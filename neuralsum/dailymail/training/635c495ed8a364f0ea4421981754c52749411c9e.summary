@entity0 takes a look at 10 things we have learned from a weekend of incredible @entity5 shocks , as well as intriguing matches in the @entity7			0
@entity9 ’s heading ability makes him feared as a striker , and he was crucial in setting up @entity12 ’s winning goal at @entity13			1
but the giant @entity14 forward is just as important to @entity15 for his defensive work			1
the goal line clearance that stopped @entity18 putting @entity13 in front was one of 12 headers that @entity9 won out of 19 he contested in the @entity5 tie			1
more than half of those were in @entity15 ’ own penalty box helping deal with corners and free kicks , rather than when the team were attacking			1
@entity9 's ( left ) strength and height becomes a welcome addition to @entity15 when they defend corners @entity12 ( c ) celebrates with team mates @entity35 ( @entity36 ) and @entity9 as @entity15 take the lead 2			1
@entity38 was still at the @entity39 with @entity40 and yet to take over at @entity41 when @entity42 paid £ 30million for @entity43 and it ’s beginning to look as if he was a player the @entity44 did n’t really want			1
the 25 - year - old @entity45 got on for only the last 23 minutes of the 0 - 0 at @entity46 and that ’s typical of how rarely he has figured for @entity38			1
he has had injuries – but even when fit all but two of his last nine appearances in a @entity42 shirt have been as a substitute			0
@entity43 has struggled to impress @entity38 and was only used as a sub against @entity56 @entity43 arrived at the club before @entity58 took charge and reports suggest he is willing to let him leave 3			1
one of the reasons @entity38 is said to be willing to let @entity43 move on is that he wants more pace in wide areas – so he ’ll be pleased to note the sudden progress being made by @entity65 since @entity66 took over at @entity67			1
the 22 - year - old , loaned out for the season by @entity42 but never a regular when @entity71 was in charge , has started three of the four games under @entity66			2
it ’s clearly helping his confidence , involved in the creation of all three goals in the @entity5 win at @entity79			2
@entity58 will be pleased to hear that on loan winger @entity65 has upped his game under @entity66 4			0
if @entity82 is really going to step up as the @entity84 successor to @entity85 he needs to add more regular goal scoring to his repertoire			1
there were other players who were more guilty of missing chances in the 0 - 0 draw with @entity92 , but 24 - year - old @entity82 had two good openings and failed to convert them in the way @entity85 in his prime would have led the side			1
@entity82 has just two goals in all competitions from 31 appearances this season , after hitting five in 39 last term			1
@entity82 is being touted as the next @entity104 captain but critics feel he needs to score more goals @entity82 shakes hands with former @entity104 youngster @entity108 during their 0 - 0 draw with @entity92 5			1
there ’s been much talk of how @entity112 need to keep @entity113 and @entity114 fit for their assault on multiple silverware but it is @entity118 who remains the real heartbeat of the side			1
at 34 the @entity123 skipper sat out of the @entity5 clash with @entity125 for a rest – only the fifth of @entity112 ’s 34 matches so far this season he ’s not figured in			1
but it ’s hard to imagine @entity132 ’s side would have fallen apart so badly against @entity134 opposition of their captain , leader , legend had been on the pitch			1
@entity132 would 've been shocked to see how badly his @entity112 side were dismantled at @entity138 keeping @entity140 fit will be a huge bonus for @entity112 , but it was @entity118 they missed in @entity125 loss 6			1
former england under 21 defender @entity145 started the season as first choice partner for @entity149 at @entity150 but lost his place in early december			0
the 24 - year - old who began life playing part - time football while working in a pub collecting glasses is clearly determined to show new boss @entity157 he should get another chance			2
he was @entity150 ’s best defender at @entity159 , making 14 clearances as his team fought off a second half onslaught from their @entity164 neighbours to hang on to a 2 - 1 win			2
@entity157 celebrates @entity150 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity164 side @entity159 7			2
winger @entity168 could finally be about to get a proper chance to force his way into @entity172 ’s team after a disappointing time since moving from @entity174 in search of regular first team football			0
the 25 - year - old has started only two games all season – ironically one of them being the 1 - 0 win t ’s against @entity174			2
but his 17 minute cameo at @entity183 was crucial to the comeback mounted by @entity186 ’s side , involved in the build - up to the equaliser and then hitting the cross for @entity192 ’s dramatic injury time winner			2
@entity172 's @entity192 celebrates his winning goal ( middle ) as @entity195 ( left ) looks on dejected @entity168 was given the chance to shine against @entity183 and he certainly did as he set up @entity192 8			0
@entity197 had a huge reputation for bringing through young players at @entity200 and he ’s doing the same thing at @entity202			0
the @entity204 boss made eight changes at @entity206 from the side which had performed so heroically at @entity183 a few days earlier in the @entity208			0
curiously one of the three whose legs were felt fresh enough for two big cup ties just three days apart was 17 - year - old @entity213			0
already the youngest ever to play for @entity42 when he made his debut at 16 and 257 days , the midfielder easily got through 90 minutes as his side fought back from a goal down to earn a replay			0
@entity197 ( left ) gave the kids a chance of first team football and they earned a replay away at @entity206 9			0
caretaker @entity223 is doing his chances of landing the job at @entity227 permanently after seeing his side beat @entity228 to score back - to - back home @entity7 wins for the first time since last march			2
@entity232 chairman @entity231 is still searching for a boss after @entity234 and his number two @entity236 chose to stay at @entity237			0
that ’s given an extended chance to 54 - year - old @entity223 , who played 233 games as a striker for the @entity232 in the late 1980s and has made it clear he wants to stay in charge			0
@entity244 celebrates @entity227 's winner as the @entity247 club continues its resurgence under @entity223 10			0
@entity249 performed miracles to rescue @entity251 from relegation last season and is beginning to drive them on again this term			0
@entity249 has brought in three new players on loan in january to revamp his side , and the 3 - 0 over promotion chasing @entity260 was his side ’s third win in a row			0
it leaves them just seven points from the play - offs			0
@entity249 performed miracles at @entity251 last season to avoid relegation , now they are on the up			0

@entity9 cleared a first half header off the line before setting up @entity12 to score a late winner in @entity15 's win against @entity13
@entity43 is looking like a player @entity38 could do without - playing just 23 minutes of the draw with @entity56
@entity82 needs to add more goals to his game if he is to replace @entity85 as @entity104 captain next season
@entity112 fans are reminded how important leader @entity118 is as they fall apart against @entity134 outfit @entity125 at @entity138
