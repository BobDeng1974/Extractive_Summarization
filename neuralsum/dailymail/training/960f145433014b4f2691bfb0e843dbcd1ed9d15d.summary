by @entity0 published : 19:26 est , 22 august 2013 updated : 19:26 est , 22 august 2013 the @entity1 is on a mission to record the flocks of migrating birds at a nature reserve in @entity6 , @entity7			2
at the centre of the project is the @entity11 family which consist of @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15			1
all these species roost in high numbers on the reserve over summer before continuing their migratory route back to @entity20			0
delicate job : after a night catching @entity13 , volunteer @entity22 collects other migrating birds at first light @entity13 is caught in a mist net as it came in to roost on a private reserve a warbler hangs in a mist net put up by ornithologist so they can measure it before releasing it to continue its migration to @entity20 another warbler is caught by experts studying the migratory birds on a reserve in @entity7 up close and personal : a @entity39 is examined and it 's measurements recorded volunteer @entity42 , who manages a local factory that manufacture bird rings holds a nightjar at the ringing hut close to the @entity48 coast the reserve is the perfect habitat for migratory bird who seek out its low lying reedbeds and marshy peat bog			1
volunteers use long mist nets which are erected on rods to capture the birds in the reedbeds before they come in to roost every evening			2
student @entity60 from @entity61 releases a bag of @entity13 after they spent a night resting in bags nestled in the heart of the @entity7 countryside the reserve in @entity6 is one of the best places to spot migratory birds after a night catching @entity13 , @entity71 student from @entity61 @entity72 collects other migrating birds from the nets at first light resting space : once the birds have been weight they are placed in ' sleeping bags ' for the night , these bags contain @entity13 after a night in the resting bags the @entity13 are released to continue with their migration to @entity20 resting : with as many as a 1000 birds being caught a night every last bit of space is used to house them including in this case a washing line the site is one of the worlds largest ringing stations , and with the help of @entity1 staff , trained ringers and volunteers as many as 1000 hirundines can be measured in one evening at this time of year			1
the birds details are then recorded before it is then released the following morning to contiinue its journey			0
the information gathered including age , weight and sex allows the @entity1 to monitor long - term population and global migration patterns which is important for conservation			0
other species are captured as part of the study are @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			0
@entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 are all part of the @entity11 family which are of particular interest as they pass through southern @entity119 on their way to @entity20 research student from @entity61 @entity122 rings a @entity13 at the ringing hut on a private reserve in @entity7 @entity13 sit in a bag at the ringing hut waiting to be released back into the wild a warbler being weighed as part of an effort by the @entity1 to measure migrating flocks a volunteer from @entity61 blows on the underside plumage of a warbler to gauge it 's maturity swallows are caught in a mist net as they came in to roost for the night @entity137 : a warbler watches the activity around it as it waits to be rescued from the nets			1

up to a thousand birds are caught a night by volunteers and experts
swallows , @entity14 and @entity13 are caught in nets
they are then weighed and measured as part of an *ongoing* research *prohect*
