by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor one day before the guffaw - inducing october 1 launch of the @entity7 program 's healthcare.gov website , white house chief of staff @entity2 was telling friends that ' when we turn it on tomorrow morning , we 're gon na knock your socks off			1
' less than three weeks later , president @entity13 asked @entity2 whether it would ever be possible to make the website function reliably			2
' can it be patched and improved to work , or does it need to be scrapped to start over ? ' the top @entity19 aide recalled the president asking him on october 17			1
@entity13 ' wanted to know if this thing is salvageable , ' he told @entity22			0
@entity13 took a victory lap in a brief speech , launched into bilateral talks with @entity52 's prime minister , and handed the hot potato to press secretary @entity54			0
a frazzled @entity54 faced a hostile briefing room that afternoon , a gathering of dozens of reporters eager to move past the back - and - forth of shutdown politics and headlong into @entity7			1
' i think that the president ’s goal is that there ’s a process in place through the various ways that people can get access to the information they need to enroll , ' he rambled during one sustained run - on , ' so that everybody who needs affordable health insurance in states across the country can look at the options available to them because of the @entity7 , because of the marketplaces , because of the increased competition created by the marketplaces , and make choices that fit their budgets , that work for them because of the subsidies available for those who have low incomes			1
' @entity88 senior @entity19 correspondent @entity86 asked about her network 's medical correspondent @entity89 , who had already gone on the air twice to demonstrate the ' fixes ' that had been applied to healthcare.gov			2
both times , on live television , @entity89 could n't log on			0
@entity54 told @entity86 that the president was personally engaged in fixing the problems			2
' nobody is more insistent that that work be done and the experience be improved than the president , as he has made clear , ' he said , adding later that ' the people who are responsible for making it work are hard at work fixing the problems that need to be fixed , and that is the focus of the president ’s attention			0
' @entity13 brought in @entity108 to supervise the repair process , but he did n't know at the outset whether it was an impossible job @entity113 administrator @entity112 has been accused of keeping the @entity19 in the dark about just how desperate the @entity7 website situation was -- and later stonewalled @entity116 about early enrollment numbers covering those first hectic weeks wunderkind : @entity19 chief technology officer @entity119 may haev saved @entity13 's legacy by springing into action , recruiting tech - savvy veterans of the president 's political operation , and patching enough software holes to get healthcare.gov working but that focus , it turns out , was on determining whether the repair was feasible at all			1
when @entity13 addressed the nation that morning after signing the bill that sent government employees back to work , he did n't mention health care reform at all			2
but three days later the president delivered a passionate stemwinder in the @entity26 , an event that @entity19 sources at the time told @entity139 was hastily assembled			1
as a newly recruited team of young tech gurus worked 18 - hour days to learn whether the online project should be patched or scrapped , @entity13 de-emphasized healthcare.gov entirely – almost telegraphing a future where call centers , walk - in appointments and paper applications would become more and more important			1
' we ’re also redoubling our efforts to make sure you can still buy the same quality , affordable insurance plans available on the marketplace the old - fashioned way – offline , either over the phone or in person , ' he said			1
' and , by the way , there are a lot of people who want to take advantage of this who are more comfortable working on the phone anyway or in person			2
' and in a moment that earned him mockery around the world as ' the @entity171 president , ' @entity13 leaped into infomercial mode			0
@entity174 secretary @entity173 ( 2nd l ) has been all smiles while hawking @entity7 -- except when testifying before @entity116 about it all was not well : by november 7 the @entity7 website was spewing gibberish instead of communicating with medical insurance customers ' the point is , the call centers are available			1
' he assured his audience			0
' you can talk to somebody directly and they can walk you through the application process			0
' ' and i guarantee you : if one thing is worth the wait , it ’s the safety and security of health care that you can afford , or the amount of money that you can save by buying health insurance through the marketplaces			0
' he even offered house calls of a sort			0
spear - catcher : press secretary @entity54 took flak from all sides on oct. 17 , 2013 , the day the president asked his chief of staff whether he should scrap the @entity7 website and start it from scratch ' if you ’ve already tried to apply through the website and you ’ve been stuck somewhere along the way , do not worry , ' the president said			1
' in the coming weeks , we will contact you directly , personally			0
' while the president papered over the technical failures of the @entity113 , @entity19 chief technology officer @entity119 was building a dream team to right the ship , time notes			1
but one recruited engineer looked at @entity7 's digital mess and delivered a stinging assessment : ' maybe we had to tell the world we 'll be back to you in six or nine months with a new site			1
' with turnaround specialist @entity108 as point man in the @entity19 , @entity226 's group took baby steps toward making healthcare.gov a workable site			2
ten days into the project they told @entity233 that they could have it shipshape by the end of november			0
that intermediate deadline became a @entity239 talking point , delivered by everyone from @entity54 to @entity174 secretary @entity173 , who was desperate for good news			0
on oct. 30 , while she was preparing to testify before a congressional panel about the project 's sequence of disasters , the website went down again – turning the computer engineers ' punch list into yet another punchline			0
the @entity19 did not respond to requests for comment about the president 's deliberations in mid-october when he learned that healthcare.gov might not be fixable .			2

@entity19 chief of staff told friends the day before launch that ' when we turn it on tomorrow morning , we 're gon na knock your socks off '
but by october 17 , the president was asking his top aides to determine whether or not the website was worth saving
three days later , he was in the @entity26 *defending* @entity7 but *boasting* how easy it was to sign up on the phone , on paper or in person
a young tech dream - team brought the website in line , but not before the online disaster set the program back by millions of needed enrollments
