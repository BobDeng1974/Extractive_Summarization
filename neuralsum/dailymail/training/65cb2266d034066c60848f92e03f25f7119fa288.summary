the @entity9 began shutting down its eight nuclear reactors almost as soon as it arrived at its pier at @entity13 in @entity14 , where thousands of cheering family members and friends welcomed the ship home from its 25th and final deployment after nearly eight months at sea			1
' it 's exceptionally emotional and exceptionally satisfying , ' rear adm. @entity21 , commander of the @entity22 , said as @entity13 came into view and his sailors manned the rails			1

copies of the ship 's daily newspaper , @entity50 , were in short supply as sailors looked for memorabilia to take with them			2
countless personal photos were taken by sailors throughout the ship as it approached shore			2
however , adm. @entity21 is the first to say that the @entity9 's final deployment was anything but a sentimental victory lap. love : people waved signs for the @entity9 's return and fought for any scrap of memorabilia from the historic ship @entity69 : the gargantuan ship 's fighter planes flew more than 2,200 combat sorties and dropped 56 bombs in @entity74 during her service the ships ' fighter planes flew more than 2,200 combat sorties and dropped 56 bombs in @entity74 while supporting @entity80 and international ground troops			1

seven boats carried the name enterprise until in 1954 , @entity95 agreed to build the world â€™s first nuclear - powered aircraft carrier			1
eight nuclear reactors were needed to power the giant ship - a new but dangerous approach because it required reactors to be harnessed together which had never been done before			1
@entity9 was built with 60,000 tons of steel ; 1,500 tons of aluminium ; 230 miles of pipe and 1,700 tons of welding rods			2
more than 800 companies provided materials for the boat which was worked on by 900 engineers			0

after returning home to @entity13 , @entity14 to have extensive repairs , @entity9 deployed for the 21st time in january 2011 and carried out multiple anti-piracy missions			1
november 25 , 2011 marked the remarkable boat 's 50th anniversary , making it the oldest ship on duty in the @entity80 fleet			0
the @entity9 has been a frequent traveler to the @entity130 over its career			0
it was the first nuclear - powered carrier to transit through the @entity136 in 1986 , and it was the first carrier to respond following the 9/11 attacks , changing course overnight to head to the @entity118			1
an entire room on the ship serves as a museum to its history , which includes a large photo of the burning @entity143 placed in a timeline that wraps around a wall			0
the @entity89 will officially deactivate the @entity9 on december 1 , but it will take several more years for it to be decommissioned as its reactors are taken out			0
about 15,000 people are expected to attend the deactivation ceremony , which will be its last public ceremony after several days of tours for former crew members			0
those who have served on the ship have a unique camaraderie			0
it is the second - oldest ship in the @entity89 after the @entity154 , and its age has frequently shown			1
sailors who work on the @entity9 have a saying : ' there 's tough , then there 's @entity9 tough			0
' things frequently break down , and spare parts for a ship that 's the only one in its class are n't made anymore			0
' she 's just old , so you got to work around her , ' said @entity167 , an electronic technician			0
' we have to make our own parts sometimes because it just does n't exist			0
' those deployed on the @entity9 knew life would n't be easy at sea , a fact highlighted last year when former commanding officer capt. @entity176 was fired for airing raunchy videos that he said were intended to boost morale			0
during a hearing in which honors was trying to avoid being kicked out of the @entity89 , he and his lawyers frequently referenced the difficult conditions on board			0
honors was found to have committed misconduct , but ultimately allowed to stay in the service			0

some of the ship 's original crew members from 51 years ago - known as plank owners - were among the 1,500 civilians who joined the @entity9 for its last two days at sea , known as a @entity195			1
' this is the end of an era that i helped start , so i was just honored that the captain invited me on board			1
there 's no way i 'd turn that down , ' said original crew member @entity204 of @entity205 , @entity206 the aircraft carrier is the eighth @entity80 ship to bear the name enterprise , with the first one being confiscated from the @entity92 by @entity210 in 1775			1
current sailors and alumni like @entity204 are lobbying to have a future carrier also named @entity9			2
the ship 's crew created a time capsule to be passed along to each @entity89 secretary until a new ship carries its name			0
other memorabilia on the ship , such as a pair of black fuzzy dice that hang in the ship 's tower that were donated by the film crew of the 1986 @entity228 blockbuster movie ' @entity229 , ' will be stored by the @entity230			2
tough : because of her advanced age the @entity9 had a reputation as a hard ship to work on , needing constant repairs - with engineers having to make parts because they are not in circulation reunited : @entity239 kisses her husband petty officer 2nd class @entity241 as the @entity9 returns to @entity13 daddy 's home : @entity243 kisses her father @entity244			1
@entity245 at the @entity9 's return celebration : three - year - old @entity248 welcomes back her cousin airman @entity249 first of her kind : the @entity9 was the world 's first nuclear - powered aircraft carrier when it was built in 1954			1
