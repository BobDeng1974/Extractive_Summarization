by @entity0 published : 19:44 est , 19 august 2013 updated : 03:08 est , 20 august 2013 lack of confidence : labour leader @entity2 fewer than half of @entity5 supporters want to see @entity2 lead the party into the next election , according to a devastating poll last night			1
just 46 per cent of those who voted @entity5 in 2010 said they would like to see him still in post in two years ' time			1
thirty - four per cent said he should go , with the rest saying they were undecided			1
the humiliating @entity18 poll , published in the @entity19 , will further add to pressure on the beleaguered @entity5 leader , who has been accused of allowing the @entity22 parties to snatch the political initiative during the summer political recess			1
last night @entity5 mp @entity25 accused his party 's leadership of spending too much time obsessing about policies designed to impress ' tofu eaters ' rather than ordinary voters			1
the @entity18 poll showed that across all voters , just 26 per cent want mr @entity2 to continue leading the party , with 40 per cent saying he should go			1
only 21 per cent of voters say they are satisfied with mr @entity2 's performance , but even @entity5 supporters are not impressed			1
less than half of those who voted for the party in 2010 - 45 per cent - are satisfied with him			1
some 31 per cent are dissatisfied			0
the poll does at least show that mr @entity2 has more backing than anyone else - including his brother - to be @entity5 leader			1
but he trails @entity45 on several aspects of leadership including ' tough decisions ' , running the economy and foreign affairs - but beats him on honesty and ' being in touch '			2
@entity5 mp @entity25 ( left ) says that the party leadership is out of touch with ordinary voters , while former @entity58 mayor @entity57 has been defending @entity2 yesterday @entity60 mp @entity25 launched an attack on the @entity5 leadership , singling out for criticism the plan to bring in votes for 16 year olds , announced at the weekend by the party 's justice spokesman @entity67			1
he suggested that @entity5 should be taking its cue from issues in its mailbag , not middle - class dinner party goers			1
@entity73 , he said : ' it may well be that when @entity67 opens his mail in the morning , almost all his correspondents are demanding that a priority of the next @entity5 government must be to lower the voting age to 16			2
after all , what else would they have to complain about in @entity82 ? on @entity86 's today programme @entity83 , senior minister throughout the @entity85 years , explained what @entity5 - and @entity2 - needs to do to rally support			1
he defended the beleaguered leader by saying that public opinion fluctuated , arguing that the poll 's depended on ' what month you take it '			0
' not a few months ago he was being praised for tackling issues and his conference speech , ' mr @entity83 said			0
' the worst job in politics is leader of the opposition			0
' he said that @entity5 now had some strong policies after its disaster at the voting polls			2
' we lost a large number of elections before we got our act together , ' he said			0
he claimed the real challenge for @entity5 now was not it 's leader or the people in the party , but making sure the public had an idea of what its policies were and eradicating the idea that @entity5 was responsible for a slew of problems			2
he accused the coalition government of developing since 2010 ' a clever mantra that everything that was wrong was down to @entity5 - we need to get out of this perspective that we were to blame			1
' ... we should be proud of what we did and learn from our mistakes			0
' he said the government needed to get a ' hearing ' about what it had achieved , and what its policies are in time for the 2015 election			0
he said : ' we need to work out how to get a higher profile in circumstances that make it hard to get a hearing			0
' we need to be clear and make sure we join our policies up so they are linked and people can see what the party wants and looks like			0
' ' but in 12 years representing @entity60 , i 've received precisely no requests from constituents - including younger ones who might actually benefit - to support such a move			0
' and when i 've been given the chance to ask classrooms of teenagers what they think of the idea , they 've generally been apathetic or opposed			0
' mr @entity25 said that people the policy was labelled ' progressive ' , those who opposed votes at 16 were caricatured as ' nasty reactionaries who hate young people ' , when in fact he just was n't impressed with a policy whose justification goes no further than ' it will engage young people '			2
he said the @entity5 leadership seemed to be more interested in persuading the @entity164 to enter into a post- 2015 coalition than in garnering support among the people			2
' @entity172 is n't being demanded by anyone , least of all 16 - year - olds who , oddly , have more important things to do with their time than worry about who to vote for			0
teenagers , eh ? @entity175 ! ' but it 's exactly the kind of middle - class dinner party issue that tofu eaters throughout the country get really excited about			1
and that certainly includes @entity185 's minions			0
not for them the irritating and , frankly , dull issues of employment and the cost of living			0
' if @entity5 is starting to move away from talking about real - life issues to talking instead about irrelevant , niche subjects that will imprss and affect nobody , then that 's sending a very clear message to the @entity164 : you can do business with us			2
' mr @entity2 did at least get some backing yesterday - from @entity57			1
the lefty former @entity58 mayor launched a scathing attack on @entity200 after he criticised @entity5 's summer performance , and told the peer : ' you screwed it up - do n't try and wreck it for others			2
' he urged mr @entity205 to ignore @entity200 , saying : ' for @entity200 to criticise anyone else given his record in government is just ridiculous			0
the last thing @entity2 needs to do is take advice from him			2
' mr @entity57 hailed mr @entity2 as a ' the most impressive @entity5 leader ' since @entity212			1
' he is a genuine @entity5 leader			0
he is not obsessed by short - term trivia , he is thinking about how @entity214 should be in 25 years ' time , ' he added .			0

thirty - four per cent of @entity5 supporters want @entity2 to go
mp @entity25 accused leadership of *focusing* on impressing ' tofu eaters '
across all voters , just 26 per cent want mr @entity2 to lead the party
