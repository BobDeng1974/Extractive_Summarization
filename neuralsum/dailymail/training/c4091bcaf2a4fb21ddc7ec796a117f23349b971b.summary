when @entity1 , 28 , crossed the finish line in an 800m race last wednesday , the crowd gave her a standing ovation			1
as i watched them leap to their feet to cheer the @entity8 , the fastest 800m runner in the @entity9 , i was baffled by their applause			1
@entity1 is 34 weeks pregnant , her unusually small bump crossing the finish line in front of her			1
afterwards , the mum - to - be said she ' deserved ' to take part in the race			2
her medical team had approved of her decision , which she claimed was all about empowerment			0
baby on board : @entity1 taking part in an 800m race when 34 weeks pregnant but as i watched her stride confidently around the track , all i felt was horror			1
watching her race was almost as shocking as seeing a pregnant woman light a cigarette			1
instinctively , i felt that this was a selfish act			0
where will it all end ? pregnant heli - skiing ? pregnant sky - diving ? bump - tastic @entity37 ? and how does it make other pregnant women feel ? the non-superwomen among us who ca n't make it to the third step of the stairs in our first trimester without an arm to lean on and a fresh supply of nibbles ? can we bear any more alpha females to measure ourselves against ? any more giant shadows to walk in on our path to motherhood ? @entity56 mum : the @entity9 athlete shows ' running like a girl ' means being strong sprint 800m six weeks before giving birth ? i struggled to get my flip - flops on in less than an hour when i was pregnant			1
but maybe my instantly negative reaction was wrong			0
maybe i was judging @entity1 harshly when , actually , i should praise her , if only to smooth the path through life of my three daughters , who i hope will one day be mums , too			1
now that my eldest is nearly 12 , i 'm beginning to imagine her as an adult - and it 's terrifying			0
only ten minutes ago i was blowing raspberries on her chubby baby thighs and sniffing her soft , gingery head as she slept on me			0
i would hate other women to criticise any of her future decisions			0
after all , @entity1 is a career athlete ; she was simply doing the job she has trained for all her life			2
it 's her body and her baby ( her husband backed her up ) , so surely i should n't even question her decision as aggressively as i did ? i was still contemplating this later in the week when a video called ' running like a girl ' became a news story			1
my moody pre-teen daughter and i watched it together , given that it was doing the rounds at her school			0
business as usual : @entity1 , right , pictured running in the @entity89 , has grown up doing sport the three - minute film shows how the phrase ' like a girl ' turns from being a positive description for any female under 13 to an insult for anyone over that age , undermining the confidence of a generation of young women			1
it showed pre-teen girls racing their hearts out to demonstrate what the phrase meant and older girls performing some form of parody of @entity110 prancing about on stage			0
' i do everything like a girl because i am one , ' my daughter said , a little confused by the debate			2
what a shame we have to keep reminding ourselves that being a girl does not mean being weak			2
if you made a film called ' giving birth like a girl ' , it would be pretty obvious how far from feeble women really are			2
so i have reversed my opinion of sprinter @entity1			2
she has become a hero in our overwhelmingly female household for giving new meaning to the phrase ' running like a girl '			1
although mr @entity131 did point out that pregnant women are prone to making inexplicable and unusual decisions			0
he used the phrase ' unstable ' , which i chose to ignore on this occasion			0
' if you recall , ' he continued , with no thought for his own safety , ' you spent the last week of your first pregnancy up a stepladder painting a ceiling until the early hours , or checking the skirting boards for holes in case a rat could get in and steal our baby			0
' you put the phone in the fridge every day , left your keys in the front door several times and once walked to the shop without your shoes on			0
if someone had asked you to run an 800m race , you may well have said yes , too			1

i was *initially* *concerned* when i saw pregnant @entity1 running
she completed an 800m race when 34 weeks pregnant
now i *'ve* realised what a hero the @entity9 *olympian* is
she proves ' running like a girl ' does n't mean being weak
