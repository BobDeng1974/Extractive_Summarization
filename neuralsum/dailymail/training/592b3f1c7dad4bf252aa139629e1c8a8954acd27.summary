by @entity0 published : 07:59 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 12:12 est , 3 january 2014 a baby girl has undergone a life - saving procedure while still partially inside her mother 's womb			2
doctors feared a rare condition meant @entity8 would not be able to breathe when she was born , so conducted the emergency procedure before her birth			1
a team of 20 medics were involved in the two - hour operation			2
@entity8 ( pictured with her parents , @entity16 - @entity15 and @entity17 ) had to have a life - saving procedure before she was born because a swelling on her neck could have prevented her breathing first , they performed a caesarean section and then inserted a breathing tube before the umbilical cord was cut and @entity8 was fully removed from the womb			1
her parents , @entity28 and @entity17 from @entity29 , were warned their baby might not survive			0
planning for the operation began after a swelling was spotted on @entity35 's neck at a 20 - week scan			1
it was pressing on her windpipe and doctors knew if the swelling was a tumour it could prevent @entity35 breathing when she was born			1
the operation was conducted by ear , nose and throat surgeon @entity47 who had never attempted it before			0
dr @entity47 said : ‘ if she was born naturally , there was a high chance she would not be able to breathe and we would not be able to help her			2
surgeons carried out a caesarean section , but before @entity8 was fully removed from the womb , they inserted a tube to allow her to breathe when the umbilical cord was cut after @entity8 's birth , the swelling in her neck subsided , allowing her to breathe normally ‘ we knew something in her neck was pressing on her windpipe and we needed to plan her delivery very carefully			1
’ mr @entity47 and his colleagues decided @entity35 's best chance was to have an @entity68 intrapartum - procedure to insert a breathing tube while she was still connected to the umbilical cord			1
they wanted to leave @entity35 in the womb for as long as possible , but not so long she might be born naturally			2
as a result , they decided to go ahead with the operation at 37 weeks			0
after opening ms @entity15 ’s stomach , they lifted @entity8 's head so a tube could be inserted into her throat			1
it was vital to keep her attached to the umbilical cord to maintain her oxygen supply			1
doctors feared @entity8 's neck swelling might be caused by a tumour , but further tests after her birth revealed the cause to be related to a thyroid problem mr @entity47 said : ‘ it is a very rare condition and we prepared for every eventuality , including her not surviving			1
‘ in the past , babies with conditions such as this would have died , but due to advances in technology we can spot problems early			0
’ as soon as the tube was inserted , the swelling which had been compressing @entity35 's windpipe subsided , allowing her to breathe normally			1
mr @entity47 , who performed the operation , said : ' the best thing was seeing @entity35 in her mum 's arms after the operation ' on further investigation , the swelling turned out not to be a tumour but a goitre , an abnormal swelling of the thyroid gland			1
mr @entity47 said : ‘ i 'm really pleased to have completed the first operation of its kind here			0
‘ the best thing was seeing the baby in her mum 's arms after the operation			0
’ @entity8 was born on april 16 , weighing 5lb 6oz			2
ms @entity15 , 30 , said : ‘ we are so grateful to mr @entity47			0
‘ we can not thank everyone enough for our beautiful daughter			0
‘ at first , @entity17 and i were told if the lump was affecting @entity35 's airways there would be nothing they could do if they could n't get a tube in to let her breathe when she was born			2
then we would have to let her go			0
‘ the operation had never been done before and we and the doctors just did not know what they would find			0
‘ @entity35 has to take medication but she has reached all her milestones and is doing everything she should			0
‘ she is trying to crawl and loves doing actions to songs as well as playing with her toys			0

@entity8 was found to have a swelling on her neck during a scan
medics feared it would *squash* her windpipe , *stopping* her breathing at birth
they performed a caesarean section but before fully removing her from the womb and cutting the umbilical cord , they inserted a breathing tube
after her birth , the swelling subsided , allowing her to breathe normally
instead of being a tumour , as doctors had feared , the swelling turned out to be a goitre - an *enlarged* thyroid gland
