by @entity0 for @entity1 yet another revolutionary tradition has been broken in @entity3 - a lawmaker voted ' no ' in parliament			1
and it was n't just any lawmaker			0
@entity8 , the daughter of president @entity9 and niece of @entity11 , gave the thumbs - down to a workers ' rights bill that she felt did n't go far enough to prevent discrimination against people with @entity17 or with unconventional gender identities			1
while it is the first time in living memory that anybody can remember a lawmaker voting against a bill , critics say the vote has more to do with @entity11 's unassailable position , rather than a changing attitude towards democracy on the island			1
precedent : @entity8 gave the thumbs - down to a workers ' rights bill that she felt did n't go far enough to prevent discrimination against people with @entity17 or with unconventional gender identities none of the experts contacted by @entity36 could recall another ' no ' vote in the 612 - seat @entity38 , which meets briefly twice a year and approves laws by unanimous show of hands			1
' this is the first time , without a doubt , ' said @entity43 , a historian and former @entity3 diplomat			1
he said even measures that were widely criticized in grass - roots public meetings , such as a law raising the retirement age , had passed unanimously in the @entity38			0
few in @entity3 were even aware of the vote until after the measure was enacted into law this summer , at which point activists publicized the vote by @entity11 - the island 's most prominent gay rights advocate			1
@entity57 , a @entity3 analyst who lectures at the @entity58 , suggested it might ' open doors for other important initiatives			2
' @entity8 herself seemed to hint there could be more debate in the assembly			2
' there have been advances in the way things are discussed , above all the way things are discussed at the grass - roots level , in workplaces , unions and party groupings , ' she said in an interview posted in late july on the blog of @entity78 , a pro-government gay rights activist			0
' i think we still need to perfect the democratic participation of the representatives within the @entity38 , ' she added			0
campaigner : @entity8 is @entity3 's most prominent gay rights advocate			1
few on the island were in @entity3 were even aware of the vote until after activists publicized it this summer others are skeptical it will set a precedent			2
' i would say that this is more a sign of what @entity8 can get away with than a sign of what your everyday parliamentarian can get away with , ' said @entity98 , a professor of @entity100 studies at @entity101 in @entity102			2
in her crusade for gay rights , @entity11 has often taken stands that challenge the social status quo , while firmly supporting the @entity108 government			2
the new labor code bans workplace discrimination based on gender , race and sexual orientation			2
but it has no mention of hiv status or gender identity			0
' i could not vote in favor without the certainty that the labor rights of people with different gender identity would be explicitly recognized , " @entity11 said in the blog interview			1
@entity9 himself has been slowly shaking up @entity3 's system by allowing some limited private - sector activity and scrapping a much - loathed exit visa requirement			1
he 's made it clear , though , that the @entity129 will continue to be the only one permitted			0
@entity8 is the daughter of @entity3 president @entity9 ( left )			1
in recent years , her uncle @entity11 ( right ) - president between 1961 and 2011 - has expressed regret about past treatment of gays on the island the vast majority of assembly members keep their regular jobs and are not professional lawmakers			2
laws are generally drafted by a handful of legislators and discussed with @entity3 before being presented to parliament			0
there was no response to requests for an interview with @entity8 , who heads @entity3 's @entity149 , an entity under the umbrella of the @entity151			1
she has spoken in the past about wanting to legalize same - sex unions , though concrete legislation to that effect has not materialized			0
that lgbt rights is even a matter of debate is a sign that much has changed since the 1960s and ' 70s , when gay islanders were routinely harassed and sent to labor camps along with others considered socially suspect			0
in recent years , @entity11 expressed regret about past treatment of gays , and today @entity3 's free and universal health care system covers gender reassignment surgery			1
but activists say old attitudes and prejudices die hard so the lgbt community needs more legal protections			0
@entity78 and about 20 others from @entity175 , a group that advocates for sexual diversity , recently sent a public letter urging @entity8 to introduce legislation to amend the labor code			0
' these are not minor details , ' @entity78 said			0
' they are social problems we have in contemporary @entity3			0
