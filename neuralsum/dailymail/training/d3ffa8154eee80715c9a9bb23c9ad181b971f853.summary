what 's in a name ? not much , it seems , as far as @entity4 chiefs are concerned : they have invited @entity5 to take part in this year 's notionally pan-european singing contest			1
organisers said they are inviting an act from @entity10 to be fast - tracked to the final this may in @entity12 , in a special move to mark the 60th anniversary of the competition			1
broadcasters hailed the ' historic ' move and said it would elevate the show to a ' new global level '			0
it is our way of saying " let 's celebrate this party together "			0
' @entity5 has until march 16 to decide who will represent them at the show , which has previously accepted entries from outside @entity43 but none from so far away			2
@entity5 singer @entity45 was a guest performer at @entity4 in @entity46 in 2014 although the country 's entry will pass straight through to the competition 's grand final , @entity5 will still be allowed to vote in both semi-finals as well			1
the country will convene a panel of judges , but organisers are considering a phone in to allow the @entity5 public to help decide 50 per cent of the votes dished out to other countries			2
but there is no chance of the @entity63 entrant will wrest this most - @entity43 of institutions to the other side of the world ; organisers promise that even if @entity5 does win it will not host next year 's show , as tradition dictates of regular entrants			1
@entity5 's participation is being touted as a one - off initiative to mark the show 's anniversary			1
however , if they do clinch the title they will be allowed to defend their crown			2
it is not the first time a country from outside @entity43 has taken part in @entity4			2
@entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , in @entity83 , have competed since 1973 , 1981 and 2006 respectively ; and @entity87 , in @entity88 , in the 1980 competition alone several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in @entity43 have also competed : @entity93 , since 1975 ; @entity94 , since 1994 ; @entity95 , since 2007 ; and @entity96 , which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition			0
@entity102 in @entity83 , @entity103 in @entity88 and even @entity104 , in the heart of the @entity101 , have all previously tried to enter @entity4 but ended up not competing after complications			0
last year 's winner : @entity107 , a bearded drag queen from @entity108 , clinched the title with her belter rise like a @entity111 at the final in @entity113 @entity114 , managing director of broadcaster @entity115 , which airs the show in @entity5 , said : ' we are very excited to have secured this historic opportunity for @entity5 to be represented on the world 's biggest stage at the 60th anniversary of the @entity4 and are honoured that the @entity31 has supported us to achieve this ambition			1
' @entity115 has been broadcasting @entity4 for over 30 years and we have seen how @entity5 ' love of the song contest has grown during those years			1
' @entity126 , director general of host broadcasters @entity127 , said : ' the song contest has developed in its history to become the biggest tv entertainment event in the world			0
' with the participation of @entity5 , together with our partners at the @entity31 and @entity115 , we have succeeded to lift it to a new global level and to build another bridge for the 60th anniversary - a bridge that spans the globe , starting from the heart of @entity43			1
' @entity139 was tonight abuzz with comment on the surprise addition to the @entity4 roster			2
' @entity5 in the @entity4 ? @entity143 is just trolling @entity43 now			2
pure humiliation , ' wrote @entity145 , an account which usually posts investment news in @entity148			0
other users questioned @entity4 chiefs ' grip of geography			1
' erm ... australia are to compete in the 2015 eurovision song contest ? ? seriously ... what ? ? did they confuse it with austria ? ? ' wrote one tweeting under the pseudonym no. another using the name @entity162 said : ' so @entity5 are gon na be in the @entity4 song contest , but they 're in ummmm okay , yeah f * * * it whatever # logic			1
' @entity167 echoed the notion , saying : ' i can kinda understand how @entity87 & @entity84 have been in the @entity4			0
but @entity5 being in it			0
that is a different story			0
' australians using the microblogging platform seemed pleased with the development			0
@entity176 gushed : ' our dream has come true ! @entity5 to compete in # @entity4 this year ! ' but others were more guarded			1
@entity180 posted a pictured of @entity107 , the bearded drag queen from @entity108 , with the comment : ' @entity5 enters @entity4			2
hope we do n't make embarrassingly kitsch spectacle of ourselves			0
' other tweets called for the further extension of @entity4			0
@entity187 wrote : ' @entity5 invited to join # @entity4 ? @entity84 already competes			1
@entity189 , surely , for @entity188 to get the green light			0

@entity5 to be fast - tracked to this year 's final to mark 60th anniversary
but if the @entity63 entrant wins next year 's contest will not go to @entity196
however , @entity5 would then be invited back again to defend its crown
