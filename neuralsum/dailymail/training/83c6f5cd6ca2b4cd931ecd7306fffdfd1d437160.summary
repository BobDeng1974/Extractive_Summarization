@entity0 , the man who struck the most famous cross in @entity3 history , was in the press room at the @entity5 on tuesday night poring over some statistics			1
he observed in the matchday programme how his club still holds the fourth highest total of major honours in the history of @entity13 football , with only @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 collecting more silverware			1
@entity3 have won seven @entity18 , seven @entity19 , five @entity20 , and of course , in 1982 , one @entity22			2
in the final against @entity24 , @entity0 delivered the ball converted by @entity26 to seal forever a moment to cherish for @entity3 fans			1
@entity29 ( left ) and @entity30 ( right ) look dejected during @entity3 's defeat to @entity32 goalscorer @entity26 ( l ) and @entity33 ( r ) pose with the @entity22 after beating @entity24 1 - 0 @entity34 is under pressure at @entity3 with the fans on his back @entity38 have been able to call on £ 65,000 - per - week @entity39 , who has commanded almost £ 50m in transfer fees during his career , during a loan spell in the @entity43			1
the @entity44 international has scored four goals in five games , after @entity34 lost trust with the striker , who cost @entity3 £ 24m			2
throw in the @entity50 secured the following season and it is 21 genuine trophies , one ahead of @entity54			0
those positions will surely be reversed by this season ’s close			0
two clubs going in opposite directions , much of @entity3 ’s success came many years ago – six league crowns before 1910			1
eleven of @entity54 ’s honours have come since july 2003			0
it does not take the sharpest brain to spot the correlation between that growing trophy cabinet and @entity69 ’s enormous investment			0
@entity3 believed they had their own sugar daddy when @entity72 @entity71 came to town in august 2006			1
initially , they very much did			0
@entity71 pumped in many millions during @entity75 ’s reign , signing the likes of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 for eight - figure fees			1
three consecutive top six finishes followed and a place among the gilded corridors of @entity22 football seemed close , as recently as 2010			0
but @entity71 felt compelled to run his ship on more streamlined terms , falling out with @entity75 in the process			2
still , @entity39 arrived for a club - record transfer , initially worth £ 18m , in january 2011 under @entity89			2
even out on loan at @entity91 , @entity3 pick up more than two thirds of his £ 65,000 per week wages			2
@entity39 fell out of favour at @entity3 but has scored four goals in five games for @entity91 @entity3 spent many millions during @entity75 's reign , including on @entity77 from @entity98 the @entity3 fans present a ' @entity101 ' banner at the @entity5 on tuesday night overall @entity71 is estimated to have ploughed into the club £ 300million of his own money – racking up sizeable @entity3 losses			1
these funds have declined in recent years as @entity71 has lost interest , but he has opened the cheque - book on occasions too			1
@entity34 ’s record purchase is £ 7million @entity30			0
@entity110 would have been bought for £ 8m had @entity112 ’s late interest not materialised forcing the loan option			0
@entity114 arrived for £ 3.2m this january			0
frees such as @entity29 , @entity116 and @entity117 were brought in for this season , and @entity120 ’s january move from @entity121 stalled at the £ 2.5m asking price , before an initial temporary switch was agreed			0
@entity124 ’s £ 80,000 per week wages were not even countenanced , but a £ 5m bid for @entity127 was made on deadline day			0
@entity34 ’s net spend at @entity3 stands at £ 44m , with much dribbled away on @entity131 gambles such as @entity132 , @entity133 , and @entity134			2
that total is more than @entity112 have paid and recouped over the same period , more than @entity137			0
@entity3 ’s failure to sell any players of great significance over this time is key , and @entity34 can not compete with the wages on offer at @entity144			2
( @entity145 ’s @entity32 have a net spend greater than £ 60m			2
) @entity3 slipped into the relegation zone of the @entity148 after the defeat @entity150 of @entity32 celebrates after scoring the second goal of the game @entity71 wants out , make no mistake			1
after searching privately for many months , he publicly placed the club up for sale last may and , despite claims he subsequently became ‘ re-energised ’ , continues to invite a buyer			0
just who would be interested at the £ 200m price @entity71 wants as @entity3 dip below the dotted line of relegation remains to be seen			1
these are critical times and an asset in the @entity43 plunges in value , particularly in light of the astronomical domestic television deal struck by the @entity148 worth £ 5.1billion			2
quite when @entity71 will study @entity3 ’s utterly rudderless 2 - 0 defeat at @entity32 from his residence across the @entity170 is uncertain			1
he last attended a @entity3 match in september , the visit of @entity16 when @entity34 ’s side had won three , drawn one of their opening four @entity148 fixtures			1
that was @entity71 ’s first game in person in two years and it seems unlikely he will be returning to ‘ enjoy ’ his club any time soon			1
they have not won in ten @entity148 games , failed to score in 15 all season			2
@entity186 has only been present at one game this season , the 3 - 0 home defeat to @entity16 @entity71 installed a new chief executive last summer in @entity189 , drafted from @entity16 , to raise the commercial pull of a club rich in history			1
the idea was for @entity34 to push @entity3 up the @entity148 table while @entity195 implemented changes to make the club self - sustainable			1
that plan is under serious threat			0
@entity34 faced renewed calls for his head from @entity3 fans at the @entity5 , a banner unfurled reading “ @entity101 ’ and chants to the same effect			1
after the game , a group of travelling supporters waited by the team bus to confront the squad			0
@entity3 will remain in the bottom three for ten days at least , with @entity211 in the @entity212 next on sunday			0
@entity189 said it was a ‘ false narrative ’ to blame the manager , but that provided little succour to supporters long starved of aspirations			0
@entity3 are in a downward spiral with a shortage of hope			0
while this trouble has been a long - time coming , something now has to change , and quick			0
@entity224 ( @entity148 - only teams present in all three seasons )			1

@entity3 hold fourth highest total of major honours in @entity13 football
but club are now *languishing* in the relegation zone of the @entity148
fans *unveiled* ' @entity101 ' banner in 2 - 0 defeat to @entity32 on tuesday
owner @entity71 has **n't** visited a @entity3 game since september
@entity3 's statistics over the last three years are **n't** for pretty reading
