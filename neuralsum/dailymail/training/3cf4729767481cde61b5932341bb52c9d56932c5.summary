by @entity0 published : 11:48 est , 31 march 2013 updated : 14:13 est , 31 march 2013 a rector who handed out 550 pounds in tenners to his congregation in the hope that they would invest it was handed back nearly £ 10,000 on @entity6			1
the staggering return on his generosity , which amounted to over sixteen times his original outlay , not only humbled reverend @entity10 but meant that much needed renovations can now be completed			1
@entity13 , 55 , rector at @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 , decided to put his hand in his own pocket last november to help with a final push to raise £ 73,000 to help with the building work			1
generous : rev @entity10 gave out crisp ten pound notes to his parishioners last year so that they could invest and make money to help pay for church renovations payback : @entity13 received £ 10,000 from his parishioners today after they invested his generous donation taking his cue from the @entity29 in the @entity30 - where @entity31 tells the story of a man who entrusts money to his servants - @entity13 wanted to see some creative ideas for a return on his investment			1
@entity13 said he had never expected such a huge response to his ten pound giveaway			2
speaking on @entity6 , he said : ' the whole thing has been fantastic and very heartwarming			0
' everyone involved has dug deep and been very , very thoughtful			0
charity : the money and gifts were handed over at a special service held at the church on @entity6 , three months after he gave out the original tenners imaginative : after giving out £ 550 pounds @entity13 has now been given back £ 10,000 in cash and goods from his canny parishioners who invested the cash ' one 11 - year - old girl handed me £ 550 , she has been making homemade cards and selling them for 75 pence each , that is a lot of cards			1
' another woman just handed me £ 50 , she said she did n't know what to do but works as a volunteer and sometimes she gets paid so she gave me a day 's wages			1
' one man was left some jewellery after his mother died and has been selling pieces of it , he gave £ 500			1
@entity70 : the reverend has thanked his parish for being as inventive as they where in paying back the money ' nine thousand pounds is such a tremendous total and much of it has been raised by the congregation , along with gifts and donations from others			1
' the whole process has been really life inspiring to those taking part			0
' i just want to say a huge thank you to the congregation			0
they are a fantastic bunch of people			0
' the handing out of the money was a good idea as a lot of these things would n't have happened if i had n't			0
there are people from eight to 80 who would n't have been able to give anything unless they had that little bit to get them started			0
' i gave £ 10 to a woman on thursday so maybe it will keep on going			1
' engineer @entity104 , 49 , was one of the congregation who took a tenner and it helped him start making birdboxes , a surprisingly lucractive sideline that has brought in over £ 700			1
he said : ' the £ 10 spurred me on to get started			2
' everyone seemed to want one once they heard about them , all the business has just been through word of mouth			0
' i 've made about 30 and i am stopping taking orders after @entity6			0
' @entity104 's sister , @entity117 , also took a £ 10 note at the service and like her brother felt compelled to put it to good use			2
faith : @entity124 @entity10 hands out the £ 10 notes to his parishioners to invest in the hope that parishioners will make a fortune to help with church repairs			1
parable : the rector has taken inspiration from the biblical tale where a man entrusts money to his servants she said : ' once people heard about it they kept coming up and asking what i was going to do with the money			0
' if i had n't taken the money i would have probably just baked a cake or something but i decided to make chocolate truffles instead			0
' i made one batch before @entity148 and another for @entity6			0
' with the @entity148 batch i made £ 280 and i still have to count up what it will be for @entity6			2
' i did n't realise how much attention it would get but it has been great for the church and people have really taken notice and helped			2

reverend @entity10 gave out £ 550 to his parishioners in november
