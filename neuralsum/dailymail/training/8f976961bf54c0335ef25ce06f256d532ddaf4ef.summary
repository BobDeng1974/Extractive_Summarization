by @entity0 under pressure : @entity2 with model @entity3 @entity6 shareholders have voted against an ‘ obscene ’ £ 28million pay package received by the new boss of the fashion house			1
chief executive @entity2 was handed 1.35million shares in the business prior to taking the top job earlier this year			1
but in a humiliating blow for the company , 53 per cent of investors voted against the controversial measure – one of the biggest revolts in @entity20 boardroom history			1
it is only the sixth time that a major @entity20 firm has seen its pay arrangements defeated in a ballot			1
however , it is likely mr @entity2 will get to keep the awards because the vote is not binding			2
the @entity6 boss , who had been creative director at the design label , was appointed to the top job earlier this year , replacing @entity31 who left to join technology giant @entity32			2
from the outset mr @entity2 ’s pay and perks have raised eyebrows			1
as well as a base salary of £ 1.1million and pension contributions of £ 330,000 , he was entitled to receive up to £ 6.6million from two annual incentive schemes			1
he was handed free shares worth £ 1.8million when he took the post and an executive discount of 80 per cent			1
mr @entity2 also receives an unexplained ‘ cash allowance ’ of £ 440,000 , which is paid in monthly instalments			1
the company refused to say what this was for			0
but the measure that galled shareholders was free shares worth £ 20million , handed to him before he took the job and only disclosed once he became chief executive – a post that requires the firm to reveal his rewards			1
unlike most schemes used by other companies , mr @entity2 is due to receive a payout from these shares irrespective of @entity6 ’s performance , providing he stays with the firm for five years			1
the @entity64 , which advises pension funds on how to vote , gave the company an ‘ amber ’ warning over the scale of its pay deals , and corporate governance group @entity67 labelled the payouts ‘ excessive ’			0
@entity6 chairman sir @entity73 , who is now facing calls to resign , told shareholders at the @entity77 meeting that it was ‘ essential that we retain @entity2 in the business ’			2
he warned that a rival firm had tried to poach the executive , who will also keep his position as creative director , and that @entity6 had to open its cheque book to keep him			0
@entity2 with model @entity3 and actress @entity88 at the @entity89 in 2011			2
the pay package included a base salary of £ 1.1million and pension contributions of £ 330,000 warning shot : experts say that investors , 53 per cent of whom voted against the group 's pay arrangements for mr @entity2 , were sending a message to the company - one of its stores , pictured salary : £ 1.1million ( base figure given annually ) cash allowance : £ 440,000 ( paid in monthly installments			1
the company refused to say what this was for			0
) pension : about £ 330,000 ( ceo is entitled to pension contributions equivalent to 30 per cent of his salary ) performance - based @entity113 : up to £ 7million ( based on 500,000 shared in the company ) other share options : up to £ 20million ( @entity117 to be the initiative that really galled investors			1
was handed to him before he took the job and only disclosed once he became chief executive ) potential total : £ 28million but the argument did not wash with shareholders and 53 per cent of them voted against the group ’s pay arrangements of the past year			1
speaking after the meeting , sir @entity73 said it was ‘ disappointing ’ that shareholders did not back the awards – but pointed out there was nothing they could do to stop them			0
’ he added : ‘ what we have to do is reflect on that and talk to shareholders			0
’ shareholders vote twice on pay – once on the directors ’ rewards from the past year and once on the company ’s pay policies going forward			2
the vote on pay from the past year is only symbolic , because the directors have already received the money and it would be impractical to claw it back			2
but the ballot on future pay arrangements is binding			0
yesterday only 16 per cent of shareholders voted against @entity6 ’s forthcoming pay policies			0
@entity150 , director of the @entity151 , said : ‘ the message to @entity6 is loud and clear – multimillion - pound pay packages are obscene , unnecessary and will damage the economy in the long - term			0
‘ if those at the top are seen to grab such vast rewards while wages stagnate for everybody else , it completely undermines public faith in business			0
’ chief executive : @entity2 , who was appointed to the job earlier this year when he took the job as boss of @entity6 , @entity2 knew he had one man to thank more than any other			1
the fashion veteran ’s interest in design and technology was sparked by his electrician grandfather , who bought him the latest gadgets as he was growing up – as well as his first @entity6 trench coat			0
the son of a carpenter , mr @entity2 studied at the @entity178 before being headhunted by @entity179 for the post of creative director of women ’s collections			0
the @entity185 fashion designer was so taken with the young graduate ’s work that she is said to have stripped in front of him just three minutes into their meeting in order to try on his collection			0
mr @entity2 rose to senior designer at @entity194 before being poached by @entity6 in 2001 , when he became part of a team that increased the value of the business from £ 1.1billion to £ 6.5billion			2
now 43 and in a civil partnership with actor @entity200 , he has taken one of the most prestigious jobs in the fashion world by becoming chief executive			0
but he will also keep his position as creative chief			0
part of his success in the role was linking the firm to its @entity20 heritage while modernising the brand			1
he has said he will donate 10 per cent of his salary after tax to the @entity215 which supports disadvantaged children .			0
