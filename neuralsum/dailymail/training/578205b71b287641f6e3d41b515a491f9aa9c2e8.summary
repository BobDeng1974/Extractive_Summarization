by @entity1 reporter published : 21:20 est , 10 february 2014 @entity3 : 08:06 est , 11 february 2014 @entity5 's vast surveillance infrastructure has been glimpsed for the first time after an artist took photos of three of the @entity5 ' most powerful intelligence sites - including the @entity11 - and making the images available to the public			1
the photos were taken last year by @entity16 , who used a helicopter to shoot the top - secret bureaus at night , @entity14 reported			1
the shots were published this week in the inaugural issue of new digital magazine @entity21			0
the three agencies captured are the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) , the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , and the @entity24 ( @entity24 )			2
the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) : with a 2013 budget request of approximately $ 10.8 billion , the @entity11 is the second - largest agency in the @entity5 intelligence community and is headquartered in @entity27 , @entity28 up until these photos were released , the media have been forced to use images of the @entity11 headquarters provided by the @entity11 themselves , which are thought to have been taken in 1970s the @entity23 : the @entity23 is in charge of developing , deploying and operating secret reconnaissance satellites and is headquartered in @entity36 , @entity37			1
spooky : the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) is responsible for collecting , analyzing and distributing intelligence derived from maps and imagery			0
according to documents provided by @entity44 , the @entity24 's budget request was $ 4.9 billion last year ¿ more than double its funding a decade ago			2
it is headquartered in @entity47 , @entity37 @entity16 said he took on the project because , as classified documents exposed by @entity11 whistleblower @entity44 dominated headlines for the last eight months , the one image being used by the media in the accompanying stories was one provided by the @entity11 themselves			1
the image , available on @entity56 , appears to have been taken in the 1970s , @entity16 said			2
' my intention is to expand the visual vocabulary we use to ' see ' the @entity5 intelligence community , ' @entity16 explained to @entity21			1
' although the organizing logic of our nation 's surveillance apparatus is invisibility and secrecy , its operations occupy the physical world			0
' digital surveillance programs require concrete data centers ; intelligence agencies are based in real buildings ; surveillance systems ultimately consist of technologies , people , and the vast network of material resources that supports them			1
' outdated : this image of the @entity11 headquarters in @entity27 and used in many of the articles featuring @entity44 , is believed to have been taken in the 1970s			1
the facility , just outside of @entity85 , has been expanded extensively and received billions of dollars of grants crucially , @entity16 has donated the images to the public domain and made them available on @entity90 and @entity91			1
he wants people to know the agencies exist , and to feel civic ownership over them in the same way they feel ownership over their local library			1
' the scale of @entity11 's operations were hidden from the public until august 2013 , when their classified budget requests were revealed in documents provided by @entity44 , ' @entity16 said			1
' three months later , i rented a helicopter and shot nighttime images of the @entity11 ’s headquarters			1
' i did the same with the @entity23 , which designs , builds and operates @entity5 ’s spy satellites , and with the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , which maps and analyzes imagery , connecting geographic information to other surveillance data			2
' the @entity113 — the largest member of the intelligence community — denied repeated requests for permission to take aerial photos of its headquarters in @entity120 , @entity37			1
' more : the @entity121 , near @entity122 , was rumored to be one of the sites where personal data extracted by the @entity11 was stored storage : an aerial photograph shows the center stash : the government has been tight - lipped about what will be stored in the center 's four ' data halls ' in june of last year , photos emerged of the one million square - foot , $ 1.9 million facility being constructed by the government in the @entity138			1
the release coincided with the revelations that @entity5 intelligence agencies had been extracting audio , video , photos , e-mails , documents and other information to track people 's movements and contacts			1
@entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and the lesser known internet company @entity158 were revealed as all involved in the program @entity161 , which the government insisted was for national security			0
officials were tight - lipped about what would be stored at the @entity121 based in @entity166 , on the @entity169 - @entity168 line			0
plans released by the @entity171 at the time of its construction showed the center had four ' data halls ' to store information and two substations to power the facility			0
powerhouse : these images were released last year as it emerged the government is secretly collecting the telephone records of millions of @entity186 customers , as well as data from companies including @entity151 and @entity153 the spy center is estimated to have cost $ 1.9 billion and is said to employ 100 to 200 permanent employees			2
the prism program was launched in 2007 with the blessing of special federal judges under the @entity194			0
it has been described by @entity11 officials ' as the most prolific contributor to the president 's @entity198 ' and the ' leading source of raw material ' , the @entity195 reported			0
in practice , if collection managers in the @entity11 's @entity204 , which manages @entity161 , have suspicion that their target is a foreign national engaged in terrorism or a spy , they move ahead to draw in all the data which would often net in information on the suspect 's contacts			2
president @entity215 has maintained that data mining ' was worth us doing ' to halt national security threats ' i think it ’s important to understand that you ca n’t have 100 percent security and then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience , ' president @entity215 said of the program last year			0
' we ’re going to have to make some choices as a society			0
' @entity215 said the prism program does not involve monitoring the email content of @entity5 citizens or anyone living in the @entity5 , and he repeatedly stated that both programs - the phone spying and @entity161 - have been approved by @entity235			2
since then , @entity215 has revealed a ' series of concrete and substantial reforms ' he believes will address public concerns			0
the proposals include changing the controversial section 215 metadata program , and what @entity215 described as the ' unprecedented ' extending of rights around monitoring to @entity245 citizens outside of @entity5			0
@entity215 contrasted the @entity11 's data collection with how corporations like @entity153 mine metadata for information around which advertising campaigns can be built			0
however , ' the standards for government surveillance should be higher ' the president conceded , admitting that ' history has too many examples of when trust has been breached ' .			0

revelations that @entity5 intelligence agencies had been extracting personal information from people across the country were exposed by @entity11 whistle - blower @entity44 last year
the one photo the @entity11 have provided of their headquarters in @entity27 , which is thought to have been taken in the 1970s
*inspired* by the ' invisibility ' of the @entity5 intelligence community , artist @entity16 rented a helicopter and took photos of three of the most powerful intelligence sites in the country
he has released the images into the public domain so that people can understand the agencies exist
