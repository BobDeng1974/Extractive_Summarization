@entity1 added the @entity3 middle name by deed poll in 2008 ‘ for a laugh ’ after joking with friends about her love of lead character @entity11			1
but the joke backfired when officials took eight weeks to refuse her passport application - meaning @entity19 missed out on a summer break to @entity21			1
the 29 - year - old was told by passport officials that her new signature @entity25 infringed on a trademark - despite it previously having been accepted for her driving licence			1
she said : ‘ it 's absolutely ridiculous			0
they told me the issue was with my signature because @entity25 is trademark			2
‘ i have the same signature on my driving licence , bank cards and everything else			0
‘ how can everybody else be happy with that signature , apart from the passport office ? ‘ @entity11 is a trademark but not my signature “ @entity42 ”			1
‘ it 's been extremely stressful trying to sort all this out and i 've now missed my trip to @entity21			1
‘ the whole application process has been an utter shambles from start to finish			0
‘ i never knew a little joke between friends was going to cause this many problems			0
’ miss @entity1 sent off for a new passport in may ahead of a pre-planned trip to @entity21 on july 16			1
but despite numerous calls to follow up the application , she was only told this week that her application had been refused			2
‘ i really like @entity7 and me and a friend were joking about what silly name we would have if we could choose one			0
‘ i just did it for a laugh as it only cost £ 49			0
it 's just a middle name so i never realised it was going to cause all this fuss			2
‘ i 've been chasing the passport office up since the beginning of july but they have been hopeless			2
’ @entity7 fan : @entity1 changed her middle name to @entity11 after @entity90 's ( pictured left with @entity88 and @entity89 ) character miss @entity1 has since been told she will need to reapply for a new passport with her old signature			1
she added : ‘ i just wish they had told me all this sooner so i did n't have to miss out on my holiday			1
‘ they knew this was a problem at the beginning of july - if they had told me then i might have been able to sort it out in time			2
‘ now i am going to have a driving licence with one signature and a passport with another			0
‘ the whole situation is a complete mess			0
’ a @entity106 spokesman said they ‘ will not recognise a change to a name which is subject to copyright or trademark ’			0
he added : ‘ we have a duty to ensure the reputation of the @entity116 passport is not called into question or disrepute			1
