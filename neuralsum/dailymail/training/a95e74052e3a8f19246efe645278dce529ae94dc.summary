the note that a @entity6 student wrote to her teacher after he told her class that he was gay			1
the man came out after learning every pupil had heard ' gay ' used as an insult he was stunned to receive the letter from the child afterwards , which described him as ' fantastic and awesome			1
' it read in full : ' dear mr @entity28 ' even though you 're gay , i will always treat you the same way as i do now			2
' i still think about you the same way as i used to			0
' you 're a great teacher and these are just some of the words that i would describe you as : great , amazing , fantastic , brilliant , awesome and brave			1
' the reason why i say brave is because you shared a personal secret which was very brave			2
' you do n't have to feel scared because i know that everyone in the class feels the same way as i do			2
' from a x x ' ps. we are all proud of you ' the teacher then shared the letter on social media			1
he told @entity12 : ' as a primary school teacher , i 'd always worried about mentioning my sexuality , despite the fact that my colleagues talked about their husbands , wives and significant others all the time			1
' then , as part of anti-bullying week , i 'd asked who 'd heard ' gay ' being used as an insult			1
almost every one of my class put their hands up			0
' the teacher , who preferred to stay anonymous , said that he welled up after reading the letter ( picture posed by models ) he continued : ' then i asked who thought that people who were gay or lesbian were bad or wrong in some way , again almost every hand went up			1
' after speaking to my @entity68 , who was very supportive , we agreed i could tell the class that i 'm gay so they at least knew one gay person and hopefully explain that when people use that word they 're talking about me			2
' ' the reaction was fantastic – there were a lot of gasps and shocked looks and some basic questions – do you have a boyfriend , etc – but after a couple of minutes they were over it and we moved on to the rest of the lesson			0
' the letter came a couple of days later			0
the little girl who wrote it gave it to me at the start of the day with all the other slips about dinner money , school trips and doctors appointments			0
' reading it brought tears to my eyes and it took me a little while to compose myself			0
when i thanked her she just shrugged and repeated something one of the boys in the class had said during the lesson , ' it 's just your life '			0
then she went back to her maths			0
' for my class it was a surprise sure but , to them , it was just something simple and easy to file away as another piece of information			0
there was no judgement , no follow - up , just acceptance			0
' now , i can mention my fiance as easily as any other teacher and my class know me a little better			2
i 've had a lot of letters and cards over the years , but this one i know i 'll keep forever			0
