@entity1 , who was forced to live on benefits of £ 71 a week after becoming unemployed , argued that he had sacked because he complained about being paid less than the firm had agreed			2
today the @entity11 ruled that his sacking was ' procedurally unfair ' , and ordered the @entity14 bank to pay mr @entity1 compensation			1
the trader was seeking a £ 1million payout , but the final amount of compensation has not been disclosed			2
' we rule that the claimant was unfairly dismissed , ' the tribunal panel said today			1
' the claimant was employed from 1998 until his dismissal from redundancy , which involved the redundancies of other individuals			0
' he claimed he was unfairly chosen for the redundancy process and the allegation was that when he had been in negotiations with @entity31 , the respondent orally agreed to increase remunerations and increase his responsibilities			2
' the dismissal was procedurally unfair			0
the respondent agrees to pay an undisclosed amount for unfair dismissal and there is no application for costs			2
' mr @entity1 dropped claims of breach of contract and whistleblowing after evidence emerged which suggested that @entity5 's promise to match the pay packet he could have received at another bank was not legally binding			1
mr @entity1 , of @entity50 , @entity51 , said he had been headhunted by @entity31 in 2010 and offered a deal worth $ 1.1million ( £ 670,000 ) a year			1
but he agreed to stay at @entity5 after his bosses promised to match the offer , he claimed			0
however , not only did his bosses fail to make good on the deal , they cut his wages from £ 533,000 to £ 518,000 , he said			1
mr @entity1 , 39 , had worked at @entity5 for 14 years when he was made redundant in january 2012 he was made redundant in january 2012 after 14 years at the bank , having worked his way up from analyst to senior trader in the company ’s derivatives division			1
he said the culture at @entity5 was such that it only allowed people to speak out if they agreed with senior bosses			0
mr @entity1 told the panel yesterday : ‘ despite my good performance , i was a squeaky wheel who was not prepared to put up and shut up			1
‘ this effectively was me signing my own death warrant at @entity5			1
that was the deal , $ 1.1million , they offered when i turned down @entity31 , and i would not just keep quiet about it			0
i was made assurances by my senior manager at @entity5 , @entity76 , that they would match this offer			0
‘ i asked for a written contract from mr @entity76 that he would match the $ 1.1million offered by @entity31 , but he told me due to the @entity80 50 per cent bonus tax at the time , he would not provide one			2
‘ when i was paid $ 850,000 [ £ 518,000 ] the following year – not the deal agreed – i was told there was not enough money to pay what was agreed			1
’ but @entity31 never put its offer in writing either , and was not ‘ hammering on his door ’ to hire him , the tribunal heard			0
mr @entity1 told the tribunal he signed his own ' death warrant ' with the company by complaining about pay @entity94 , representing @entity5 , said mr @entity1 had never received a written contract agreeing the new job or terms of the offer			1
during a heated exchange , mr @entity99 claimed : ‘ the truth is you did n’t have an offer to match			0
it is quite common for bankers at bonus time to say “ it is n’t enough ”			0
i do n’t think i ’ve ever met a banker who thinks he is overpaid			0
’ the trader replied : ‘ i have written my witness statement and sworn an oath and you keep asserting i am lying			0
‘ i do n’t think anyone can sit and say being paid $ 800,000 is being underpaid , but it just was not what was agreed			0

@entity1 was unfairly dismissed by @entity14 bank , tribunal rules
he is awarded undisclosed payout from the bank following *judgment*
mr @entity1 told tribunal he had ' signed his own death warrant ' by arguing over £ 518,000 salary after he was headhunted by rival
