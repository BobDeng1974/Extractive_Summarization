by @entity0 published : 09:57 est , 5 december 2013 updated : 12:47 est , 5 december 2013 a coroner has called for all nursery staff to undergo paediatric first aid training following the death of a nine - month - old baby			1
the plea came as an inquest concluded little @entity9 's death was due to ' misadventure ' , after she choked on mashed up shepherd ’s pie on only her third full day at nursery			1
her grieving parents have blamed a ' catalogue of errors ' for the death of their daughter , who had started coughing during her lunchtime feed from a supervisor at @entity21 in @entity22 , @entity23			1
however , an expert witness said @entity9 had suffered a rare condition as a result of choking , which meant she could not have been saved , and that nursery staff could not have recognised the problem			1
tragedy : @entity31 died after choking on shepherd 's pie during her third full day at nursery , prompting a coroner to suggest all nursery staff should undergo first aid training the inquest was told that the supervisor at the privately - run nursery - whose basic first aid certificate had expired - shouted for help and passed her on to a colleague who did have paediatric first aid training			1
@entity9 was pulled from her high chair and given five slaps on her back - instead of a repeated sequence of chest thrusts and further back slaps			2
her condition fluctuated and then deteriorated as an ambulance arrived 10 minutes after staff dialled 999 on october 23 last year			0
the emergency call was wrongly graded as ' serious but not life threatening ' situation - which usually results in a response time of 20 minutes - when it should have been graded as an ' immediately life - threatening case			0
' ruling : the inquest jury concluded little @entity9 's death was misadventure , after she choked while she was being fed on her third full day at a nursery grieving : @entity9 's parents @entity64 and @entity66 grieving parents have blamed a ' catalogue of error 's for their daughter 's death and an emergency call handler who had no clinical training and who sent the ambulance to the nursery ended the call by saying : " jeez , stop giving me information "			1
the hearing was told the call handler @entity82 made her comment after she put down the phone - unaware she was still being recorded			0
during the call she had used scripted questions and felt ' bombarded with details '			0
she did not give evidence in person after the court received a doctor 's note saying she was ' medically unfit '			0
no disciplinary action will be taken against her			0
there were no signs of life as @entity9 was taken to @entity97 and she was pronounced dead soon after arrival			0
it emerged during the hearing at @entity101 ’ court that @entity9 suffered a rare complication as a result of the choking in which air was able to get into her partially blocked airway but not out			1
the trapped air placed pressure on her heart which led to a fatal cardiac arrest			2
loved : @entity9 as a newborn with her father @entity114 , left , and right with both her parents , who said they had expected nursery staff to be trained in first aid an expert witness in paediatrics told the inquest that the condition was uncommon			1
the only effective treatment would have been a medical procedure where a needle is inserted to the chest to release the air pressure			0
paramedics are trained to carry out such a procedure but it would have been difficult to make the correct diagnosis in such a young child			0
the inquest heard that nursery staff could also not be criticised for not recognising its nature			2
in returning its verdict of misadventure , the jury said @entity9 had inhaled a particle of food into her left lung causing in a rare and difficult to detect condition - pneumothorax			1
the panel said they did not believe she could have been saved			0
@entity21 did fulfil its legal requirements in ensuring at least one staff member with a paediatric first aid training certificate was on the premises at any given time			1
it emerged that all nursery employees had to undergo paediatric first aid training in the wake of @entity9 ’s death			1
scene : along with paramedics , police were also called to @entity155 , in @entity22 , where @entity9 choked in october last year following the verdict , @entity157 coroner @entity156 said he would write to the secretary of state for education @entity159 to ask that all nursery staff have such training			1
he said sending the letter ' as a matter of national importance '			0
he also vowed to write to the chief inspector of the @entity167 calling for better training for call handlers			0
following the inquest @entity9 's parents @entity171 , 28 , a quantity surveyor and @entity114 , 40 , a a building inspector , hit out at the nursery			1
in a statement the couple said : ' from the moment @entity9 started choking , she was totally reliant on the nursery staff until the ambulance arrived			1
the appropriate first aider should have dealt with the incident and not left @entity9 's side			2
' if she had continued as she had been trained to do we believe @entity9 would have had a better chance of survival			0
a number of nursery staff noticed that @entity9 was in a serious condition			1
' as parents when we drop off our children with anyone who looks after them who have relevant qualifications especially in paediatric first aid , that when a critical incident happens we would expect them to use their first aid training to help our child in distress			2
in memory : the couple have started a charity in her name , @entity205 , to offer free first aid training for anyone who looks after young children ' we believe a catalogue of errors of judgement and failing to follow training led to a situation where once the paramedics attended it was too late to save our beloved daughter			1
' mr and mrs @entity9 have started a charity in her name , @entity205 , to offer free first aid training for anyone who looks after young children			2
in a statement @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity155 said : ' while today 's outcome is comforting in that it confirms our understanding that we did everything we could to save @entity9 , it does n't alter the fact that she 's no longer with us and we 'll continue to miss her and think of her family every day			0
' this has been a devastating time for everyone involved and we would like to thank our parents , past and present , as well as the local community for all of their words of support and comfort which have helped sustain our dedicated nursery team , who 've been heartbroken by @entity9 's loss			2
' at the time of the incident , @entity155 already exceeded the number of trained paediatric first aiders required by the @entity244			0
' @entity245 , director of emergency services for the @entity247 , said : ' @entity248 would like to express its sincere condolences to @entity9 's family for their very sad loss			0
we accept the jury 's conclusion and would like to thank the coroner for his handling of this sensitive case - we are now considering his helpful recommendations			2
