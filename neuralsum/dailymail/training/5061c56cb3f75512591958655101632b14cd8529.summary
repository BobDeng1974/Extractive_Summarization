by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity4 's @entity3 title hopes have faded dramatically following wednesday ’s 2 - 2 draw at home to bottom - of - the - table @entity7 , a result described by midfielder @entity10 as ' a complete disaster '			1
a team that not so long ago were chasing an unprecedented quadruple now look like finishing @entity15 ’s first season in charge with just the @entity17 to show for their efforts			0
@entity20 assesses where it has gone wrong for @entity4 , and what @entity15 must put right in the summer			1
falling short : @entity4 's title hopes have taken a tumble following a difficult week on the pitch living on a prayer : @entity15 needs a minor miracle to overtake @entity28 and @entity29 now @entity31 's @entity30 the failure to sign a world - class central defensive partner for captain @entity35 has dogged @entity15 from the start			1
having spent more than £ 100million in other positions and then failed to prise @entity39 from his old club @entity40 , the @entity4 boss settled on @entity41 , a cut - price alternative at £ 4m			2
inspiration and exasperation : @entity35 ( left ) is world class but @entity41 ( right ) is a liability the criticism levelled at the @entity48 has not always been entirely fair , but he has emerged as the weak link in the team , despite the almost blind faith shown in him by the manager			2
city are already making plans to address the issue with talks over a £ 35m deal for @entity60 ’s @entity59 well advanced			0
@entity61 @entity15 insists that he will not curb his attacking instincts but he might have to think again if he wants to get @entity4 over the line next season			1
you can not fault his team 's attacking flair this season in terms of entertainment ; they have put six past @entity71 , seven past @entity72 , 11 past @entity73 over two games and demolished @entity75 twice in the derby			0
blow : @entity4 were outfoxed by @entity29 at the @entity78 in february , when @entity79 scored the winner however , all six @entity3 defeats this season have been by one goal			2
against @entity29 at the @entity78 in february , @entity83 outfoxed @entity15 with a counter-attacking masterclass while , at @entity88 on sunday , @entity4 ’s refusal to sit on a 2 - 2 draw that would have suited them far more than @entity28 cost them dear			1
a little less cavalier , a little more caution might go a long way next time			0
@entity91 no - one can question that the £ 30million deal for @entity10 last summer was money well spent			0
the @entity94 has been a key figure for @entity4 this season , anchoring the midfield and allowing @entity99 the freedom to shine			2
but @entity4 need another defensive midfielder , either to fill in for one of those two or to give @entity15 the option of pushing @entity99 into a more advanced position where he can do more damage			1
@entity105 has shown a slight improvement but @entity107 has never settled since moving from @entity108 , and both players could be offloaded in the summer			0
@entity4 pursued @entity110 from @entity60 in january and it would be a surprise if they did not try to resurrect that deal			0
set him free : @entity99 has been @entity4 's driving force ... but only when he is allowed to roam the pitch free strike - out it ’s a sign of how much @entity4 ’s breathtaking goal output has dropped off since the end of january that @entity120 was still the team ’s top scorer when he returned to the starting line - up against @entity7 despite a third lengthy layoff of the season			1
keeping @entity120 free of soft tissue injuries will obviously benefit the team in future , but they may also need to look at bringing in a world - class striker to help him			1
fragile : @entity120 is @entity4 's star striker but the @entity48 has spent three long spells on the sidelines @entity134 , @entity135 , seems to have lost his bite after a ferocious start , @entity133 continues to divide opinion and may well be sold in the summer despite talk of a new contract , and a succession of injuries have prevented @entity143 from living up to expectations since his arrival from @entity146			2
@entity147 , @entity148 and @entity149 could all be on the market this summer , and it will be interesting to see if @entity4 are among the bidders despite the constraints of @entity154			0
matter of trust @entity15 acknowledged at the start of the season that he had the strongest squad in the @entity3 ; he has two top players in each position			1
and yet , when it has come down it , the manager appears to have had a problem trusting fringe players like @entity105 , @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168			0
on the fringes : @entity166 has not been trusted by @entity15 , despite several crucial contributions this term with @entity4 chasing trophies on four fronts for much of the season , it has piled the workload onto his key men , and it is perhaps no coincidence that @entity99 , @entity178 and @entity35 are among those struggling with injuries as the title race hits the home straight			1
@entity15 must either learn to trust his squad players or replace them with some he can .			0

@entity4 are now third *favourites* to win the @entity3
@entity35 has no support in central defence
@entity15 has been too cavalier in his approach
@entity10 needs top - class partner in defensive midfield
@entity120 carries too *big* a *goalscoring* burden
key players have been *overworked* by @entity15
