by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 01:47 est , 23 december 2013 @entity3 : 01:48 est , 23 december 2013 fire stations across the country are in financial limbo as they wait for the @entity8 ruling on whether they have to provide volunteer firefighters medical insurance under @entity12			1
according to the @entity12 , businesses with more than 50 full - time employees are required to provide health insurance for them , a full - time employee defined as someone who works over 30 hours a week			1
@entity19 representative @entity18 , a @entity20 , says that having to provide insuance will ' threaten public safety ' by putting ' unbearable financial burdens ' on already cash - strapped stations			1
financial burden : @entity19 representative @entity18 visits the @entity26			0

' so , we 're left to try to pave over the potholes			0
and this is a big one - possibly affecting fire stations nationwide			2
' @entity29 says the broad definition of full - time employee is hard to apply to a fire station staff			1
' does it mean when a volunteer is wearing a beeper or carrying a fire department cell phone ? ' @entity18 asks			2
' does it include downtime at the station house ? listening to a scanner ? these are all legimimate questions raised since @entity12 has been forced on @entity55			0
