by @entity0 published : 18:46 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 06:14 est , 18 january 2013 urgency : @entity1 called off a long awaited speech on @entity3 @entity1 dramatically called off a long - awaited speech last night in which he was due to warn @entity5 is heading towards the @entity7 exit unless key powers are returned			1
in the wake of the bloodbath in @entity12 , the prime minister abandoned a planned trip to the @entity14 , where he had been due to deliver a landmark address on @entity5 ’s future in @entity3			1
mr @entity1 had initially been expected to make the speech at last autumn ’s @entity19 conference , but it has been repeatedly delayed			1
it is now not clear when it will happen			0
the prime minister plans to promise the first referendum on @entity5 ’s place in @entity3 since 1975			1
when the speech is finally delivered , he will say the @entity5 no longer accepts one of the founding principles of the @entity7 – that membership means ‘ ever closer union ’ , according to senior sources			1
he will insist that powers must flow in both directions between member states and @entity34 , setting out plans to renegotiate the terms of @entity5 ’s membership before asking voters to accept or reject it in a vote expected to take place in 2018			1
@entity42 , including @entity43 and @entity44 , are content with mr @entity1 ’s stance			1
but the long - delayed speech will lead to demands from dozens of @entity48 for the prime minister to legislate for a referendum before the next election – even without the support of the @entity53			0
@entity48 are also insisting a referendum pledge must be a ‘ red line ’ in any future coalition negotiation with the @entity53 , warning it can not simply be ditched if mr @entity1 fails to win an outright majority and seeks a new power - sharing deal with @entity59			1
but he risked infuriating @entity75 by warning them that their union could fall apart unless they addressed a growing democratic deficit felt not just in @entity5 but across the continent			0
in extracts released by @entity81 before the speech was called off last night , mr @entity1 said : ‘ i want to speak to you today with urgency and frankness about the @entity7 and how it must change – both to deliver prosperity and to retain the support of its peoples			1
‘ i come here as @entity5 prime minister with a positive vision for the future of the @entity7			2
a future in which @entity5 wants , and should want , to play a committed and active part			0
’ mr @entity1 was to argue that there were three challenges that threatened the @entity7 – the eurozone crisis , competitiveness and public support – which must be addressed			1
‘ why raise fundamental questions about the future of @entity3 when @entity3 is already in the midst of a deep crisis ? ' why raise questions about @entity5 ’s role when support in @entity5 is already so thin ? ’ he was due to say			2
‘ there are always voices saying , “ do n’t ask the difficult questions ”			0
but it ’s essential for @entity3 – and for @entity5 – that we do because there are three major challenges confronting us today			0
‘ first , the problems in the eurozone are driving fundamental change in @entity3			0
second , there is a crisis of @entity3 competitiveness , as other nations across the world soar ahead			0
‘ and third , there is a gap between the @entity7 and its citizens which has grown dramatically in recent years and which represents a lack of democratic accountability and consent that is – yes – felt particularly acutely in @entity5			2
’ the prime minister had been expected to point to a rise in @entity132 sentiment in countries that have been forced to implement austerity measures in order to remain in the union			0
‘ there is a growing frustration that the @entity7 is seen as something that is done to people rather than acting on their behalf , and this is being intensified by the very solutions required to resolve the economic problems , ’ he was due to say			2
under siege : the gas field in @entity147 , @entity12 where militants held a number of workers including some @entity5 hostage			2
the situation has forced mr @entity1 to abandon his speech in the @entity14 he believes the best opportunity to reshape @entity5 ’s relationship with the @entity7 will be offered by treaty change to allow the countries of the eurozone to forge a closer economic and political union designed to keep the single currency together			1
repatriation of powers on social and employment law and a @entity5 opt - out from policing and criminal justice measures are seen as key areas			2
last night former @entity169 pm @entity168 , a leading federalist , likened the prime minister to ‘ a suicide bomber threatening to blow himself up unless he gets his own way ’			0
he added : ‘ @entity1 will not succeed if he attempts to hold his @entity3 partners to ransom			0
’ provocative : @entity178 @entity177 's @entity176 a @entity53 mep provoked widespread disgust last night when he claimed the terrorists had won by forcing mr @entity1 to abandon his speech in @entity182			1
sir @entity177 , leader of the liberal grouping in @entity34 , tweeted : ‘ @entity184 1 , @ @entity185			0
’ a senior @entity187 source said : ‘ that is completely inappropriate			0

@entity1 was to warn that @entity5 could exit the @entity7
he wants powers to flow in both directions between @entity34 and the @entity5
he abandoned a planned trip to the @entity14 due to the @entity12 crisis
eurosceptic senior @entity42 are backing mr @entity1 's stance
the pm plans to offer @entity5 it 's first @entity7 referendum since 1975
