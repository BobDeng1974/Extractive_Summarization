@entity1 women living in the @entity2 gave birth to 23,000 children last year immigrant mothers : more than a quarter of births in @entity2 last year were to mothers born outside the @entity2 a record number of nearly 200,000 babies were born to immigrant mothers last year , figures revealed yesterday			1
the children of women who were themselves born abroad made up nearly a quarter of all the babies born in @entity2			2
the report by the @entity17 pointed to the growing impact on the population of the historically high levels of immigration in recent years			0
it said understanding the impact of childbearing among migrants is ‘ essential for planning services such as maternity provision and schools ’			0
the figures showed that 24 per cent of births in 2011 were to women who had not themselves been born in @entity2 , which is the best indicator statisticians have for who is an immigrant			2
in @entity37 , where a high proportion of migrants choose to live , the share of births to foreign - born mothers was well over half , 57 per cent			2
the five countries from which the greatest numbers of foreign - born mothers came were @entity1 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			2
the share of new babies born to migrant mothers has more than doubled in 20 years and continues to shoot up			0
figures : graph showing live births in @entity2 between 2007 and 2011 to women from the top five countries ( @entity17 ) according to the @entity17 analysis , the number of babies born to @entity2 - born mothers barely changed in the five years from 2007 to 2011 , up from 603,000 to 612,000			1
however migrant mother births went up from 169,000 to 196,000 , an increase of 16 per cent			0
the report said there had been a 24 per cent rise in the number of women of childbearing age who were born outside the @entity2 and a fall of 5 per cent in the number of @entity2 women of childbearing age since 2007			2
it added that mothers from @entity1 , who gave birth to 23,000 children in @entity2 last year , are now at the top of the league table of foreign - born mothers in @entity2 even though birth rates in @entity1 itself are low			1
on the rise : a graph showing the percentage of live births in the @entity2 to @entity84 born mothers between 2001 to 2011 marked difference : pyramid of the female population living in the @entity2			1
it shows the number of births for @entity2 born women and non-uk born women , between 2007 and 2011 ‘ this can be explained by the younger age structure of the population born in @entity1 and by timing effects , given that the majority of those born in @entity1 will be people of young working age who have migrated to the @entity2 since @entity102 accession in 2004			1
’ nearly 6,000 babies were born to mothers who were themselves born in @entity105 , enough to put @entity105 seventh on the list of countries from which migrant mothers come			0
however the report pointed out that ‘ many of those born in @entity105 will be @entity2 nationals whose parents were serving in the armed forces in @entity105 at the time of their birth ’			2
general fertility rates for the top five @entity84 maternal countries of birth and for @entity2 born women in 2011			1
@entity43 is markedly highest , followed by @entity46 baby boom : more than four out of ten births to foreign mothers last year were in @entity37 ( file picture ) the @entity17 added : ‘ the increase in the proportion of births to @entity84 born mothers living in the @entity2 illustrates how the demographic make - up of the @entity2 is changing			1
’ the report said there were marked regional differences in the fertility rates of women , both of those born abroad and those born in @entity2			1
overall , foreign - born women were likely to have 2.28 children during their lives , while @entity2 born women could expect , at 2011 fertility rates , to bear 1.89 children			1
but there was a bigger gap in @entity37 , where fertility rates were higher for foreign - born women and where fertility rates for @entity2 - born women were ‘ well below average ’			1
this may be because a higher proportion of @entity2 - born women in @entity37 than elsewhere are pursuing education and careers and delaying childbirth and families			1
@entity155 and family @entity157 - born @entity155 , 34 , gave birth to her son @entity159 in july at the @entity160 in @entity37			1
miss @entity155 , who works in banking , arrived in @entity37 in 1996 as an 18 - year - old looking for a better future			2
six years later she met her partner , 39 - year - old @entity164 , and the couple now live in @entity166			0
miss @entity155 said when she first arrived there were more opportunities for her in @entity37 than in @entity157			0
but she added : ‘ the opportunities seem to have reversed			0
if there was something for us to do there we might consider going back			0
all my family still live there			0
’ the couple are acutely aware of the pressure childcare costs will have on their finances			0
mr @entity164 , who works in the media , said : ‘ a nursery will cost us £ 1,200 per month			0
i ’d like a second child , but it ’s so expensive			0
