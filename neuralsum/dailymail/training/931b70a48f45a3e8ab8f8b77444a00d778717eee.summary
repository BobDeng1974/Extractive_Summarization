mr @entity2 , 39 , contacted the park ranger but remained unconvinced by his assurance the birds were being relocated to a country park - even after the ranger sent him a picture of them supposedly being released			1

’ in large numbers @entity65 can have a detrimental impact on their environment , producing large numbers of droppings which contain bacteria and phosphates blamed for polluting watercourses , and dispersing native species			0
