the @entity0 will revive their £ 1million inheritance tax pledge at the next election			1
@entity3 said yesterday the threshold should rise to ensure only the rich pay death duties			2
without action , the number of families paying the 40 per cent levy will double to one in ten over the next five years			1
yesterday mr @entity3 said the issue was ‘ something we ’ll have to address in our manifesto ’			2
‘ i believe in people being able to pass money through the generations and pass things on to their children , ’ he said			1
‘ you build a stronger society			2
inheritance tax should only really be paid by the rich – it should n’t be paid by people who ’ve worked hard and saved and who bought a family house			2
’ mr @entity3 ’s intervention is part of a deliberate pitch to ‘ grey voters ’ who have been hit by low interest rates			2
in last week ’s @entity61 , @entity60 targeted a series of measures at the over- 60s , including ‘ pensioner bonds ’ offering market - leading rates , increased @entity68 savings limits and opt - outs from pension annuities			0
the prime minister suggested the @entity0 could revive their ‘ brilliant ’ pledge from the last election to raise the inheritance tax threshold to £ 1million when challenged over the broken promise by a prominent @entity77 councillor			1
during a question - and - answer session with @entity80 members in @entity19 , @entity81 , he said the policy had been impossible to deliver because the @entity83 were ‘ very opposed ’ to it in coalition negotiations			1
but he acknowledged that rising house prices had put it back on the agenda			0
mr @entity3 stressed that mr @entity60 ’s proposal for a higher threshold had forced the then @entity91 government to effectively double the existing allowance for married couples			1
mr @entity3 also hinted that he would protect benefits for wealthy from cuts in the next @entity77 manifesto the move is also widely credited with killing off @entity99 ’s plan to call a snap poll – ‘ the election that never was ’ of 2007			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ one of the reasons @entity60 made that pledge was this point about property			1
‘ when the limit was £ 300,000 , quite a lot of hard - working families , who worked hard and saved and put money into their house , were being caught by inheritance tax			1
tax rates by the numbers ‘ the ambition is still there – i would like to go further ... it ’s something we ’ll have to address in our manifesto			0
’ mr @entity3 appeared to be unsure of the existing rules – suggesting couples have a joint threshold of about £ 750,000			0
in fact the figure is £ 650,000 , twice the £ 325,000 for a single person			0
@entity77 sources yesterday said precise details of the party ’s new stance would not be revealed until closer to the election			0
experts also pointed out that the @entity132 has frozen the threshold until 2017/8 to help pay for the introduction of the new cap on the cost of social care			0
but mr @entity3 ’s statement of intent will cheer many traditional conservatives			0
@entity77 mp @entity142 said : ‘ it is very encouraging			0
the prime minister is starting to show us what a proper @entity77 government would look like			1
‘ this is becoming a big issue again because rising house prices mean that a lot of people who are not rich are being caught up by a tax that was meant for the very wealthy			1
‘ it is a natural urge to want to leave something for your children and it is wrong that people of average means who have worked hard all their lives are facing these punitive tax rates			0
’ former @entity77 cabinet minister @entity163 gave a more cautious welcome to the announcement , warning that other tax cuts , such as raising the 40p threshold or reducing capital gains tax , might take priority			1
he said : ‘ all tax cuts are good news , but there will be plenty of competition for which will be the best tax cuts			0
’ @entity176 , deputy chairman of @entity177 , who challenged mr @entity3 over the issue yesterday , said a person ’s main home should be excluded from inheritance tax altogether			0
mr @entity176 , son - in - law of @entity183 , said : ‘ i understand why we have not been able to keep our promise on this but it is disappointing			0
‘ @entity188 prices are rising year on year , if not month on month , and people who want to leave something for their children or grandchildren are being caught up by this			0
’ the @entity195 warned last week the proportion of estates hit by death duties was set to double from almost one in 20 to nearly one in ten during the next five years			0
the independent forecaster said revenue from inheritance tax will soar by an average of almost 11 per cent a year as ever more families are dragged into it			2
mr @entity3 also hinted yesterday that he will repeat his manifesto pledge to protect pensioner benefits such as the winter fuel allowance and free tv licence at the next election			2
the @entity91 lead over the @entity77 has narrowed dramatically in recent days , and is down to just one point in three different polls , including this one from @entity214 for the @entity215 he said a final decision had yet to be taken , but he added that scrapping it would ‘ save a tiny amount of money and introduce another complexity into the system ’			1
the prime minister also insisted that the new £ 75,000 cap on the costs of social care would prevent people having to sell their homes to pay for end - of - life care .			1

prime minister expresses *regret* that @entity83 killed off idea in 2010
tells a saga event in @entity235 families should be able to pass money down
also hints he wants to continue protecting benefits for wealthy pensioners
@entity0 buoyed by @entity243 , with @entity91 lead down to one point
