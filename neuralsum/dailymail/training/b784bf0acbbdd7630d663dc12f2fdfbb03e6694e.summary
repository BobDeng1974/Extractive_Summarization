postboxes are so often spotted in our cities and towns that we rarely hail them as feats of craftmanship			0
but these pictures show the skilled work which goes into creating a @entity10 icon			2
the classic pillar box has rarely changed in the 160 years since they were introduced as a modern experiment in the channel islands in 1852			0
in fact , the most recent alteration to the roadside pillar box has not been in its design , but in its status - post boxes are now private property after last month 's sell off of the @entity22			0
the men and women responsible for shaping the country 's most familiar roadside fixture work for @entity27 in @entity28 , @entity29			1
pride of place : a new pillar box stands proudly on a @entity10 street			0
this year the iconic boxes are 160 years old after being inspired by @entity36 and @entity37 versions famous cast : pillar post boxes wait to be assembled in the dressing shop of @entity41 in @entity28 , @entity29 flat pack : as well as making the famous pillar box , @entity27 also produce wall boxes and lamp boxes , which can be seen laid and ready for assembly , above heavy duty : the pillar boxes were designed to be sturdy to prevent them being taken or tampered with			1
their narrow slits are also designed to keep out rain hands on : although they are cast to shape , the boxes still need to be ' dressed ' by skilled staff at the workshop , here , @entity54 , gets to grips with the base of a box @entity27 manufactures all the post boxes for the @entity22 in the @entity10 , and has done for over twenty years			1
they shape the cast iron structures to order , making both the classic pillar box and also wall boxes which are placed into the side of buildings			1
the famous receptacles are moulded before being shaped and welded together in the company 's workshop just outside @entity71			1
they are then given the famous lick of red paint which makes them the most famous of @entity10 street furniture			1
special delivery : lamp boxes , like the ones being made by @entity80 , above , have to be made specially so they can be attached to fixtures like lamp posts seal of approval : the post boxes of @entity22 bear the mark of the monarch reigning at the time of manufacture			1
here , @entity89 refers to the queen production line : @entity27 have been the sole maker of the @entity22 post boxes for more than 20 years , they also refurbish old red telephone boxes for @entity96 classic : a painter applies the famous red paint to a pillar box			1
post boxes were first green , but people complained that they blended in with the countryside try again : the @entity104 then decided to try painting their boxes a shade of chocolate brown but the added varnish meant the maintenance of boxes was too expensive the post boxes came into the hands of shareholders earlier this month when @entity22 was privatized			0
initial share prices of 330p rocketed after the sell off , their current worth is 540p			0
that steep rise led to criticism of the government for selling the historic mail service too cheaply			0
post boxes were first places on our streets after the famous novelist @entity124 , who once worked as a @entity125 at the @entity104 , suggested to his bosses that @entity10 needed fixtures similar to those he had seen on @entity36 and @entity37 streets			2
in 1952 , the state owned service agreed to trail three cast - iron pillar boxes on @entity132			1
later that year a further four were introduced on @entity133			0
@entity135 solution : in 1874 , it was finally agreed that all post boxes in @entity10 should be painted red			2
it would be another 10 years before the repainting project was finished work in progress : the boxes are stood on batons to keep them from sticking to the factory floor as painters work their way through a batch old hand : experienced craftsman @entity149 paints the last few spots of a post box by hand at the factory , which is just outside @entity71 work in progress : the first undercoat applied to the boxes makes them look a shade of pink			1
hard wearing red paint is added later to minimise the need for touching up drying time : the iron shapes are stood up to dry in great lines of red at the factory			1
they will eventually be shipped off to destinations all over the country the first trial was considered a success and boxes began appearing on the @entity10 mainland from 1853 , but it was not for another five years that a standard design began to emerge with local authorities agreeing on the most practical shape for ease of use and keeping out rain			0
post boxes got their famous colour after a certain amount of trial and error			2
the earliest boxes were green so as not to be an eyesore in the landscape , but they were so effective that the @entity104 was flooded with complaints from people who could not find their local drop off point			0
inside job : all parts of the pillar boxes have to be treated , as above , to prevent letters which have been posted being effected by oxidisation hung up : lamp letter boxes like the ones seen above are common in country villages were they are suspended from utility poles or lamp posts the next incarnation of the boxes were chocolate brown , but these were more expensive to upkeep so , eventually , in 1874 , it was agreed that the standard colour of the postbox should be red			2
there are few exceptions to the famous colouring			0
most recently in 2012 , it was agreed that the local postboxes of victorious @entity10 athletes at @entity214 would have their postboxes painted red			0
that saw the more than 100 pillar boxes across @entity218 , @entity29 , @entity219 and @entity220 turn gold in recognition of @entity224 's record breaking summer			1
modern technology : lamp letter boxes first began to appear in @entity228 's affluent squares in 1897 , much later than their free standing predecessors boxed off : before the post boxes can receive any mail , they have to be sent themselves to their final destination where they will be hung and fitted with collection times sign of an icon : despite the changing nature of the @entity22 and the @entity104 , the traditional red post box exists as a reminder of its great history			2

amazing picture show how famous red boxes are made in a workshop in @entity29
the iron structures are cast before being *reshaped* by craftsmen in @entity28 , near @entity71
they are then *sprayed* in the iconic paint before being touched up by hand and dispatched
