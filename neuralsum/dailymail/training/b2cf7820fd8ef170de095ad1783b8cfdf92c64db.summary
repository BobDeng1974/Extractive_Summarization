by @entity0 published : 12:33 est , 3 december 2012 updated : 12:35 est , 3 december 2012 @entity2 governor @entity1 : ' [ it 's a ] consequence of the choice by the @entity5 to remain outside the euro area ' @entity8 's most senior state banker was today accused of a ‘ naked attempt to steal @entity11 ’s financial crown ’			1
@entity1 , 62 - year - old governor of the @entity2 , said the @entity13 should be stripped of its status , and the bulk of its business be transferred to mainland @entity17			1
but a furious @entity18 , mayor of @entity11 , said : ‘ this is a desperate @entity8 attack in an effort to make something out of the @entity23 crisis			1
’ mr @entity18 added that the move ‘ shows utter contempt for the principles of the single market and it will not succeed			1
’ mr @entity1 , a @entity28 - born career financier who has worked in @entity29 , insisted there was ‘ no rationale ’ for allowing the @entity23 ’s main financial centre to be ‘ offshore ’			1
@entity5 has never signed up to the single @entity17 currency , mr @entity1 argued , and ‘ most of the euro business should be done inside the euro area			1
‘ it 's linked to the capacity of the central bank to provide liquidity and ensure oversight of its own currency , ’ mr @entity1 told the @entity36			1
‘ we 're not against some business being done in @entity11 , but the bulk of the business should be under our control			2
that 's the consequence of the choice by the @entity5 to remain outside the euro area			0
’ @entity49 , @entity5 ’s business secretary , also attacked mr @entity1 , saying : ‘ i do n’t think his analysis is correct			1
’ during a visit to @entity28 , mr @entity49 said other ‘ serious @entity8 bankers ’ believed that ‘ having a strong @entity5 financial sector is important for @entity17			1
it is not a zero sum game			0
we want to be part of a single market in financial services			0
’ the @entity13 has served as @entity17 ’s main financial centre since the setting up of the single @entity17 currency			1
lord mayor of london @entity18 and business secretary @entity49 both criticised my @entity63 's words today more than 40 per cent of euro foreign - exchange transactions are conducted in @entity11 , a bigger share than the rest of the @entity23 combined			1
mr @entity1 ’s attack is the latest in a long list which have been launched by @entity8 financiers on @entity5			1
shortly before @entity71 ’s stripped @entity8 of its @entity73 credit rating in january , mr @entity1 said that @entity5 ’s rating should be cut before that of @entity8 as the @entity5 had ‘ as much debt , more inflation , less growth than us ’			1
@entity80 – @entity81 , the head of the @entity8 financial regulator , has also described the right – wing of @entity5 politics as ‘ the world 's stupidest ’			1
@entity89 leaders meet on tuesday to try to broker a deal on giving the @entity91 ( @entity91 ) sweeping powers to supervise lenders			0
the move , which will not include @entity5 , will be the first step towards creating a @entity23 banking union			2
@entity97 , @entity5 's chancellor , backs a union in principle , but has pressed for safeguards to stop the new bloc from forcing its rules on non-members			0
@entity1 has come into criticism in the past for not revealing his salary , which is said to be well into six figures – making him one of the highest paid civil servants in @entity8			1
after studying in @entity109 and @entity28 he did his military service in the @entity111 , and then became a treasury secretary before spending two years as a @entity8 respresentative to the @entity89 in @entity29 in the early 80s			2
he was vice-president of the @entity91 for four years up until 2002 , and was appointed governor of the @entity2 in 2003			0
fiscal tactics : an @entity91 scheme that allows it to purchase a eurozone country 's sovereign debt , is vital to restoring the functioning of monetary policy and dispelling fears that the euro currency block could break up @entity1 , a @entity91 governing council member , also defended the tactic of pumping money into ailing economies			2
warning that global economic growth remained sluggish and fragile , he said : ' expansion in central bank money has not affected inflation expectations , which have remained well - anchored			2
' @entity1 poured cold water on perceptions that central banks may have lost some independence after the global financial crisis in 2008 , arguing that the non-conventional measures taken by major central banks were never imposed by governments			2
' in all countries , non-conventional measures and the consecutive expansion of balance sheets were a deliberate and voluntary response to financial market developments that threatened their integrity , their functioning and overall economic stability			0
' @entity148 governor @entity147 , who spoke alongside @entity1 in @entity149 , also appealed for understanding that the @entity148 does n't adjust monetary policy to match investors ' expectations			2
' while central banks should have deep respect for financial markets ... they should be willing to stand up to the market from time to time , ' he said			0
the @entity148 has been under intense political pressure to take bolder action to beat deflation that has plagued @entity162 for more than a decade			0
@entity163 , the head of a main opposition party set to win next month 's general election , has called for ' unlimited ' easing to achieve 2 per cent inflation and a possible revision to a law guaranteeing the @entity148 's independence			0
in any case , central banks have ' many tools ' available to mop up liquidity when needed , he added			0
an @entity91 scheme that allows it to purchase a eurozone country 's sovereign debt , known as outright monetary transactions ( @entity178 ) , is vital to restoring the functioning of monetary policy and dispelling fears that the euro currency block could break up , he said			0
@entity1 said it was also up to eurozone governments to improve public finances and use structural reforms to make the region 's economies more competitive as a sovereign debt crisis that started in @entity190 is poised to enter its fourth year			2
' it has always been perfectly clear that the responses to the real roots of the crisis can only be provided by the governments themselves and that monetary policy can never durably mitigate political shortcomings			0
' @entity1 also rebuffed criticism that the @entity91 's government bond purchases could be equivalent of monetising public debt , saying that the central bank is allowed under law to conduct such purchases from the secondary market			1
the @entity178 can only be enacted if a country applies for a bailout and agrees to improve public finances and implement sometimes painful structural reforms , he said , so the strict conditions will help bolster confidence in the region			0
@entity91 policymakers hold their regular monthly policy meeting on december 6 and are widely expected to leave interest rates on hold at a record low of 0.75 per cent			0
economists are divided on whether the central bank will cut next year .			0

@entity1 said @entity13 should be stripped of its status - with businesses moving into @entity23
