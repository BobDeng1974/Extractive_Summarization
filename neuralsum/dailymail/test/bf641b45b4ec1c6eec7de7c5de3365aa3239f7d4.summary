@entity0 believes @entity2 would now struggle to attract top players thanks to financial restrictions players such as @entity28 's @entity17 ( left ) and @entity29 midfielder @entity16 would prefer to go to one of @entity2 's @entity5 rivals , according to @entity0 @entity0 believes @entity2 need to be bold and take on @entity33 's @entity24 regulations ' unless @entity2 are bold and decide to take on @entity33 ’s @entity24 regulations , they will find it difficult to compete with @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 for the players i believe could make the difference in next season ’s title race , ' said @entity0			1
' if any of the top four is able to add @entity44 , @entity45 and / or @entity16 and @entity17 to their squad this summer , they would instantly become front - runners to win the @entity5 next year			0
' there will be an intense fight between all of the top four clubs to secure the best players , but if that battle takes place on an even playing field , i do n’t see how @entity2 can come out on top			0
' the landscape has changed since @entity2 were able to blow everybody out of the water by paying big fees and big wages to sign the likes of @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			2
' @entity2 have previously manager to attract the likes of @entity65 and @entity63 @entity7 had to blitz the market and sign the likes of @entity71 last summer he added : ' @entity24 has reined @entity2 back in and @entity7 and @entity9 have upped the ante by spending big themselves and raising the ceiling of their pay structures			1
' when @entity7 were faced with the doomsday scenario of being out of the @entity78 last summer , they had to blitz the market to sign the likes of @entity71 , simply because they had to throw money at the problem they found themselves in			0
' and that is big issue facing @entity2 this summer -- @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are now all capable of taking them on in the transfer market and , if a player has a straight choice between the four clubs , @entity2 will come fourth every time			0
