by @entity0 @entity1 remained on course to take on 2013 winner @entity3 in wednesday 's @entity5 as @entity6 turned on the taps			1
clerk of the course @entity10 was due to irrigate ‘ about 75 per cent of the course ’ which had turned good to firm under the baking sun on day one of the meeting			1
the @entity5 is already down to four runners after @entity14 , one of @entity17 ’s two entries , was pulled out lame			1
foregone conclusion ? @entity19 winner @entity1 will take some beating in the @entity21 with @entity23 - trained @entity1 having had a chip from an ankle joint removed last year , there were fears that owner @entity27 might pull out his @entity29 2,000 guineas and @entity31 winner			1
those concerns were heightened when @entity34 ’s @entity33 slipped and fractured a knee in the @entity36 , won by @entity38 ’s @entity37			2
but @entity27 ’s racing manager @entity39 said : ‘ the intention remains to run as long as it is not rock hard			2
then there would have to be a discussion but hopefully they will be watering the course			2
’ whether @entity46 , @entity33 ’s jockey , will play any further part at the meeting is dependent on x-rays he was due to have on his left arm last night			0
after inconclusive assessment at the track , he flew back to @entity53 with his arm in a sling			0
gone with the wind : trainer @entity57 is hoping @entity58 can change his fortunes at @entity6 the fall has already cost the rider , who won saturday ’s @entity62 at @entity19 on @entity63 , a winner with @entity64 deputising on @entity65 in the @entity66 at @entity67			1
@entity46 is due to ride @entity63 in next month ’s @entity68			0
meanwhile , @entity3 ’s trainer @entity57 will hope for better fortune on day two after having two odds - on favourites beaten			0
@entity73 was twice hampered when third to @entity75 ’s @entity74 in the @entity76 but @entity77 travelled well before being beaten fair and square in the @entity78 by @entity80 ’s @entity79			0
the latter ’s jockey @entity81 is facing a lengthy ban over his use of the whip .			0

@entity1 will race at @entity5 in @entity6 after course was watered
2013 winner *tornado* provides main *competition* for @entity19 *champion*
race is already down to four runners after @entity95 pulled out
