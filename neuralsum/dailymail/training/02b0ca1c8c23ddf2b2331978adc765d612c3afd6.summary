a woman in her fifties feared for her life after weight gain sent her blood pressure to dangerously high levels			1
@entity6 , 51 , from @entity7 , was dependent on various medications due to her ill - health and feared her days were numbered			2
she told @entity10 : ' i was being monitored weekly for my dangerously high blood pressure			1
i took five tablets a day and i was very worried			0
i was afraid i was going to die			0
' slimmed down : @entity6 now weighs 11st 5lbs and is a dress size 10 - 12 , left			1
before , right , she was 17st 5lbs and a size 20 growing up , @entity6 had always been fit and active but in 2006 she had an accident where she damaged her shoulder and so was unable to exercise			1
her weight crept up until by the time she was aged 50 , she tipped the scales at 17st 5lbs			2
she said being a dress size 20 made her feel self - conscious and unhappy			1
she explained : ' i was morbidly obese and depressed - i was at my lowest point in my life			0
i sat at home with the blinds closed and would n't want to see or speak to anyone			0
' my damaged shoulder gave me constant pain so i could n't exercise to lose the weight			0
but my weight made me feel depressed and lacking in energy , i could n't be bothered to do anything anyway			0
' but when @entity6 heard how her raised blood pressure was endangering her life , she knew she had to do something to become healthier			1
concern : @entity6 's weight sent her blood pressure to dangerously high levels she decided to try the ' body by @entity43 ' after her daughter , @entity44 , 29 , lost 2st 4lb on the diet plan which involves substituting some meals with replacement shakes for 90 days			1
@entity6 said : ' i was sceptical about the challenge at first , but my daughter had great results so i had nothing to lose - apart from the weight ! i convinced my husband to follow the plan with me			1
' just ten days into the diet , @entity6 began to notice a change in her well - being after she lost 10lbs			1
her weekly blood pressure check - up with her gp revealed it had dropped for the first time in eight years			2
more confident : @entity6 said losing six stone has given her a new lease of life , left			0
she said before , right , she felt low on energy and depressed			0
she recalled : ' my gp took my blood pressure five times on one arm and with two different machines			2
he was n't saying anything and i was starting to get worried about what he was going to say			0
' finally he explained that my weight loss had a huge impact on reducing my blood pressure - even my gp was shocked at how much it had reduced			1
' the improvement was the incentive @entity6 needed to stick with the plan and she went on to lose a total of six stone			2
she now weighs 11st 5lbs and is a dress size 10 - 12			1
changed her life : as a result of her weightloss , @entity6 's blood pressure has come down and she feels happier and healthier @entity6 said her new slim figure has made her feel young again and full of confidence			1
she said : ' now i feel 21 not 51 ! as a result of losing the weight i am now able to run around with my grandchildren			0
i 'm out partying meeting lots of people and helping them improve their lives			0
' best of all , she said dieting has been ' like a miracle ' as her blood pressure has reduced so much , she no longer needs to take medication			2
