preventing your mind from wandering from an important task may be as simple as putting on a pair of glasses			1
the inventor of smart spectacles called @entity7 , claim they can train your brain to stay focused			2
they use sensors to monitor a wearer ’s brainwaves and alert them if they start to daydream and let their attention drift elsewhere			1
when they start paying attention again , the lenses clear			1
@entity31 , the inventor of @entity32 , claims that with repeated use , the glasses can train a person ’s brain to focus for longer periods of time as well as help them relax and get a good night ’s sleep			1
the 28 - year - old , explained : ' the @entity7 ' sleep training programme is designed to improve the performance of a brain pattern known as @entity42 ( sensorimotor rhythm ) which is related to relaxation			2

here , a woman has lost focus on her book , indicated by the lenses on the glasses turning opaque the glasses are designed to use neurofeedback technology , which relays the information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head ( illustrated right ) , to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness			1
an app will record a user 's progress in improving their concentration @entity32 is a headset that uses sensors to measure a user ’s brain patterns and send these signals to a set of electrochromic lenses			1
when a wearer ’s attention drifts , the lenses darken and when they focus , the specs clear			1
users will be able to train their brains by practicing keeping the lenses clear			1
the idea is that with work , they will be able to stay focused for longer and even learn how to shift into a state of focus at will			2
by doing two 30 - minutes training sessions a week , they will start to see improvements in their brain 's overall performance , mr @entity31 ’s @entity85 page claims			1
‘ through repeated training sessions , you can learn how to encourage good habits and discourage bad ones , ’ it says			0
‘ the calming program is designed to help manage stress by regulating the level of alpha and theta waves which have been linked to anxiety , panic disorder , and obsessive compulsive disorder			0
’ the glasses are designed to use neurofeedback technology , which relays the information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head , to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness			2
mr @entity31 , from @entity106 in @entity107 , said : ‘ @entity108 has proven to be a useful tool in helping people improve their concentration , sleep , memory , anxiety and self - esteem			2
' ‘ @entity32 brings neurofeedback out of the clinical setting and into your living room , office , air plane seat , park bench or anywhere you are			0
’ mr @entity31 ’s @entity85 page says : ‘ by doing just two short training sessions a week , you can improve your brain 's performance ’ and that just 10 sessions are needed before users start noticing a difference in their ability to concentrate			1
' @entity32 will come with five training sessions : one to boost a person 's ability to concentrate and learn and retain information , one to boost creativity and hand - eye coordination and another to help wearers fall asleep more easily			0
@entity32 will come with five training sessions , including one to boost a person 's ability to concentrate and learn and retain information , one to encourage creativity and hand - eye coordination and another to help wearers fall asleep more easily			0
one of the exercises is shown users will have to wear a connected armband - which holds a battery and extra electronics to provide a @entity148 connection – as well as the glasses , which have three sensors attatched the @entity7 system uses neurofeedback , which is described as exercise for the brain			1
the neurofeedback technology in the glasses relays information from the adjustable sensors that rest on the head , to the electrochromic lenses that can change darkness			2
studies have shown that neurofeedback training increases neuroplasticity , or the brain ’s ability to form connections between brain cells , according to mr @entity31			0
the training has been proven to significantly improve people 's day to day lives by helping with concentration , sleep , anxiety , memory , self - esteem , fine motor skills , and overall mood			1
‘ significant results have been achieved in slowing the cognitive effects of ageing and improving learning challenges with lasting effects , ’ the @entity85 page says			2
there will also be a programme to boost self - confidence and self - awareness , as well as managing stress more effectively			0
users will have to wear a connected armband - which holds a battery and extra electronics to provide a @entity148 connection – and will be able to monitor their progress in exercises using an accompanying app and set goals for themselves			2
the neurofeedback system was originally developed by mr @entity31 ’s parents , @entity200 and @entity201 , in partnership with @entity203			0
in 2009 , @entity200 was diagnosed with the degenerative disease als but continued to work on the @entity108 system with his son until he died in 2013			0
‘ it was the best opportunity of my life to work with my father on developing neurofeedback systems , ’ @entity31 said			0
‘ i could n't have asked for a better partner and mentor			0
my father was a leader in his field and a true visionary			0
’ he is raising money to put his glasses into production on crowd sourcing website @entity85 , where they can be pre-ordered from $ 295 ( £ 199 )			1
‘ @entity7 development is completed and we are ready to begin production , ’ he said			0

narbis glasses have dry sensors to monitor a wearer 's brainwaves
lenses will darken if the system *detects* a user has lost focus on a task
when they start paying attention again , the lenses will clear
exercises improve concentration , sleep and stress levels , inventor claims
glasses system can be pre-ordered on @entity85 from $ 295 ( £ 199 )
