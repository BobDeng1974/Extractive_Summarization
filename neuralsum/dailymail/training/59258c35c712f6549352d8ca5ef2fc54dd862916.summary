@entity0 has been accused of ' hypocrisy ' for ignoring @entity4 's @entity3 crisis while trying to reap electoral profit from @entity8 's @entity7 problems			1
more than 100 patients have signed an open letter to the @entity4 leader claiming he has ' turned a blind eye ' to more serious failings in @entity14			1
they also demanded a full inquiry into the @entity3 's troubles – a call echoed by one of @entity20 's most respected surgeons			1
@entity0 has been criticised for ignoring @entity4 's @entity3 crisis while trying to gain electoral profit from @entity8 's @entity7 problems former @entity23 president professor sir @entity22 said there were enough worrying ' smoke signals ' to justify holding an independent inquiry into potential problems in the @entity3			1
he pointed to previous concerns raised by @entity4 mp @entity29 , the @entity30 , @entity8 medical director sir @entity31 and the @entity23			2
sir @entity22 suggested the review should be like the one carried out by sir @entity31 in 2013 into @entity37 hospitals with high mortality rates			0
he said : ' i feel there may be issues in @entity14 that are similar to issues found in @entity8 some time ago			2
rather than sweep it under the carpet or deny it , the sensible thing would be to consider investigating it properly			0
' when we had similar problems in @entity8 , sir @entity31 was asked to look at those hospitals where there appeared to be a higher mortality rate			1
' it seems to me that that is the responsible way to handle it			0
the problem is that it 's a political football at the moment			0
' mr @entity0 has repeatedly vehemently criticised the @entity57 ' handling of the @entity7 in @entity8 in recent months			1
but he has refused to deny claims that he said he wanted to ' weaponise ' the @entity3 to help win the @entity59 in may			0
now 131 patients in @entity14 have backed a letter organised by the @entity62 that condemns the ' scandalous postcode lottery ' in waiting times , ambulance delays and @entity67 standards			0
they tell mr @entity0 in the letter : ' you regularly claim that the @entity70 is in a state of ' crisis '			1
however , you have consistently refused to comment on the situation in @entity14 , where you lead the party that runs the health service			0
' as the leader of the @entity4 , we are asking you to take responsibility for this state of affairs , to back a public inquiry into the condition of the @entity3 , and to commit to work with @entity82 to increase the budget and restore equality of care standards across the @entity20			1
' it is simply hypocrisy to call it a crisis in @entity8 and then turn a blind eye to the more serious situation in @entity14			0
' a new poll shows the @entity3 will be the top issue for voters at the election , and mr @entity0 has sought to capitalise on the problems in @entity8 's @entity7			1
the @entity4 leader tweeted this month : ' the @entity57 ' @entity3 crisis means more patients than ever on record are waiting over 4 hours in @entity67			2
only @entity4 will protect our nhs			0
' but new statistics show that only 81 per cent of patients visiting @entity3 emergency units in december were treated within four hours , the lowest rate since records began in 2009			2
@entity62 leader @entity106 said it was a disgrace for mr @entity0 to speak of a crisis in @entity8 when he refused to call @entity4 to order in @entity14 in @entity8 90.2 per cent of people were seen within this time limit against a target of 95 per cent , although the numbers are not directly comparable because of differences in how they are recorded			1
last month , 2,420 patients at major @entity67 units in @entity14 had to wait more than 12 hours before being treated , and over the past year there were 15,895 such waits			0
@entity62 leader @entity106 said it was a disgrace for mr @entity0 to speak of a crisis in @entity8 when he refused to call @entity4 to order in @entity14			1
' @entity0 is making a grave mistake in seeking to ' weaponise ' the @entity3 as an election issue , and @entity3 patients in particular will be furious at his double standards , ' he added			1
' every time he speaks about health , people are reminded of the devastation that the @entity4 has unleashed on the @entity3 after years of savage budget cuts			0
' a @entity4 spokesman said : ' @entity131 attacks @entity14 to run away from his own record in @entity8 , where @entity133 are in crisis and patients are waiting longer for operations and cancer treatment			2
' the independent @entity138 found that no one part of the @entity20 has a health service that is consistently ahead or behind			0
the @entity3 improved dramatically in the past 15 years			0
when the @entity57 were last in charge in @entity14 , patients waited two years for operations – that 's why people do n't trust them with the @entity3			1
' @entity146 , director of the @entity147 in @entity14 , yesterday criticised the rival parties for using the @entity7 as a ' political football '			2
she told @entity14 ' @entity151 programme that @entity14 needs more than 2,500 extra nurses , including 1,000 in acute care to tackle the @entity67 crisis .			0
