a showdown over the passports of so called ' foreign fighters ' – @entity3 and other westerners who have joined the @entity6 terror army in @entity7 and @entity8 – came to a head on thursday when a @entity3 senator killed legislation aiming to strip them of their citizenship			1
democrat @entity14 , a freshman senator from @entity15 , objected on the @entity17 floor when @entity18 sen. @entity18 of @entity19 tried to fast - track his ' @entity20			1
’ @entity18 bypassed the @entity17 's committee process in order to rush the legislation to a vote , meaning that any single senator could block it			2
since the @entity17 is sprinting through its final days in session this year , he said , putting the bill through committee ' would mean that it could not pass in time to prevent @entity3 fighting right now with @entity6 from coming back and murdering other @entity3			1
@entity14 said she chose to throw up a road block because ' legislation that grants the government the ability to strip citizenship from @entity3 is a serious matter raising significant constitutional issues			1
' she also cited letters of objection from the @entity63 and the @entity64			0
the question of what to do about @entity6 - aligned foreign fighters who have @entity3 passports has occupied the attention of the @entity70 , the @entity71 and the @entity72 , which issues passports and can revoke them if a judge agrees there 's a compelling reason			1
in testimony thursday before the @entity78 , secretary of state @entity77 argued that the @entity3 needs ' to stop the foreign fighters who carry passports from countries around the world including the @entity3			1
' ' what i want to make certain , @entity77 told the congressional panel , ' is that anybody who has a passport [ and joins with @entity6 ] ' who returns , returns in handcuffs – not through customs with their passport			1
' ' i do n't think these guys are ten feet tall , ' he said later			0
@entity78 chairman rep. @entity94 , a @entity95 @entity18 , agreed			0
' i think we need a way to approach this to make certain that their ability to come into the @entity3 is made a hell of a lot more difficult than it is right now , ' @entity94 told the secretary			2
but @entity77 warned about the possibility of interfering with law enforcement , saying that canceling a passport could give suspected terrorists a heads - up that they 've been identified in @entity109			2
' we ... need to do that with sensitivity to certain investigations that may be going on , ' said @entity77 , ' because you do n't want to flag something			0
' in the same hearing , homeland security secretary @entity115 said that ' the suspension of passports should be considered on a case - by - case basis , ' not with a law that drives every circumstance toward a single outcome			0
' suspension and revocation of passports can be done on an expedited basis when the situation warrants , in a matter of hours or days , ' he said			0
not just @entity6 : @entity129 , an @entity130 affiliate active in @entity131 , has seen several @entity3 join their fight , mostly from a @entity134 suburb with a high concentration of @entity136 and @entity131 immigrants secretary of state @entity77 told the @entity78 on thursday that he wants to see @entity3 ' foreign fighters ' coming back to the @entity3 in handcuffs , not through customs fbi director @entity141 ( left ) and homeland security secretary @entity115 ( right ) said immediately canceling passports of @entity6 foreign fighters might interfere with law - enforcement investigations @entity70 director @entity141 said passport revocation is ' of interest to us , ' but added that the @entity3 ca n't do much to stop foreigners from friendly nations entering the @entity3 – even if they 're aligned ith @entity6			1
the @entity3 and its allies have identified people of @entity156 , @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 origin who are confirmed to be @entity6 - aligned foreign fighters			1
without a safeguard , they would be able to enter the country without travel visas			0
@entity141 said the @entity70 might encounter ' due process ' challenges trying to persuade a court to cancel a passport for terrorism - related reasons , since much of the evidence in such cases would consist of secret intelligence			2
' how would i protect sources and methods ? ' he asked			0
' how would we be able to use , if at all , classified information to make the showing that would be necessary ? @entity141 also said a one - size - fits all mandate to strip the citizenship of foreign fighters might impede law enforcement investigations			2
' sometimes it makes sense under limited circumstances , ' he said , ' to let somebody back in and cover them very closely to see who they connect with			0
' ' sometimes , ' he added , ' it makes sense to let them come back in the country and lock ' em up right away			0

sen. @entity14 , a @entity15 @entity193 , stood to object when @entity19 @entity18 sen. @entity18 asked for ' *unanimous* consent ' to pass his bill quickly
the measure would have terminated the citizenship of any @entity3 who joins or assists a terror group that 's likely to attack @entity3 interests
@entity14 *insisted* that the bill raised constitutional questions and cited complaints from the @entity64
secretary of state @entity77 told @entity208 that ' foreign fighters ' who help @entity6 should return ' in handcuffs – not through customs with their passport '
@entity77 said he has *authority* to cancel passports ; the @entity70 director said it 's sometimes useful to let terrorists back into the country and watch them
