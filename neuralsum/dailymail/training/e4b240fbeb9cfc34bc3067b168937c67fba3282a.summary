picture this : you 've taken the week off work and booked a holiday on a remote tropical beach			0
you land , drop of your things and walk down to the shore ... only to find a formidable mountain of thongs , plastic bottles and false teeth			1
late last month , three tonnes of junk washed up on @entity15 beach , a remote and tropical area in far northern @entity17 a team of @entity20 rangers and workers from the @entity22 spent five days clearing the seven - kilometre shoreline a turtle hatchling scrambles for the surf on @entity15 beach			1
it is believed that a third of turtle deaths in @entity30 happen from plastic ingestion late last month , three tonnes of junk washed up on @entity15 beach in northern @entity17			1
a team of @entity20 rangers and workers from the charity @entity22 spent five gruelling days cleaning the seven - kilometre shoreline			1
amongst the expanse of waste they found fishing nets , false teeth , bags full of plastic bottles ( some filled with urine ) and an enormous army of toy soldiers			1
@entity48 , the co-founder of @entity49 , said her company got word of the waste from a local team of rangers			1
‘ we work closely with the local waste rangers			2
they said they had seen a lot of waste washing up in the direction of @entity15 beach , which is a hotspot for @entity65 debris			0
‘ it ’s a very desolate area without many communities , so the rangers were naturally overwhelmed by the project and they called on us to come and help out			0
’ @entity70 is on the @entity71 , which gets a large amount of stray waste from the @entity74 in @entity75			1
the current then moves on towards the @entity77 , harming all marine life in it 's path			1
@entity48 said the labels on much of the waste showed it had come from foreign shores			2
‘ the labels suggest the waste was predominantly from south - east @entity75 , which is consistent with our prior experience			1
’ @entity48 said that since much of the waste was plastic , it can stick around in the ocean until a big tide comes and washes it ashore			1
' the fact that most of the waste is coming from international waters certainly makes it more difficult to tackle as an issue			0
@entity48 , the co-founder of @entity49 , said her company works closely with the local waste rangers ( pictured above ) who advise her when there is significant waste buildup a team of @entity20 rangers and workers from the @entity22 sorts through 6000 thongs that washed up on the beach @entity70 is on the @entity71 , which gets a large amount of stray waste from the @entity74 in @entity75			1
when it 's not strewn with waste , @entity70 is a beautiful site a ranger 's four wheel drive transports ecotourist volunteers along @entity15 beach looking for turtle nests ' it 's a serious problem			0
it 's impacting the marine life across the whole of the @entity122			1
' it is believed that a third of turtle deaths in @entity30 happen from plastic ingestion			0
amongst the masses of junk on the beach , the remains of local turtles were found			2
' we need to work at this from a federal level using government agencies			0
it 's the only way we can really have an impact on the waste disposal from our neighbouring countries			2
' some of this waste is coming from third world countries where there is barely no recycling institutions			0
the only way to impact this is through government co-operation			1
' @entity48 says the issue is only going to get worse			2
' the bottom - line is that our population is increasing			0
and more people means more waste			0
' tackling pollution needs to be a two pronged approach			0
we need to continue to build teams to clean up the areas that are badly effected , but we also need to look at the data and put pressure on the companies that are producing the most waste and ask them to take more responsibility			0
' @entity22 , the name for the god of the ocean in @entity166 mythology , has been operating in @entity30 since 2004			2
the foundation has reportedly removed 3 million pieces of marine debris from the @entity30 coastline			0
