@entity2 's @entity1 sprint supremacy continued in @entity4 country on thursday as @entity5 triumphed in @entity6			1
the 194 - kilometre sixth stage from @entity8 took place on wet roads , with crashes accounting for a number of riders			1
it was @entity5 ( @entity43 ) , left out of position in the first three sprints of the @entity1 , who benefited , the @entity2 champion finishing arms aloft for the sixth tour stage win of his career			1
@entity47 ( @entity48 ) was second , with @entity49 ( @entity50 ) third , while @entity22 ( @entity51 ) finished safely in the pack to retain the race leader 's yellow jersey he claimed on stage two in @entity56			1
after a chaotic and epic day over the cobbles of stage five which accounted for defending champion @entity60 , there were further victims of crashes on thursday			1
@entity64 's problems continued as @entity66 @entity65 joined @entity60 in exiting the tour with a suspected broken collarbone			2
tricky : the 194 - kilometre sixth stage from @entity8 took place on wet roads @entity60 abandoned on wednesday 's fifth stage after the pain caused by three crashes in two days , with @entity75 following after being caught up in a crash after 79km			1
it means @entity78 , who inherited the leadership of @entity64 from @entity80 , now has just six team - mates to call upon with the race less than a week old			1
@entity83 ( @entity48 ) also quit after the large crash , which also caught up @entity85 ( @entity86 ) , while @entity87 ( @entity88 ) , a key mountain domestique for @entity90 , abandoned soon afterwards			1
race leader @entity22 called a temporary truce as the peloton slowed to allow those riders embroiled in the crash who were able to continue to rejoin the main bunch			1
the accidents happened as the speed was increasing in preparation for the intermediate sprint			2
slog : the pack rides up a slight gradient during the sixth stage to @entity6 the feared crosswinds on the route did little to separate the peloton on a stage which was destined to end in a bunch sprint			1
the day 's four - man breakaway of @entity110 ( @entity111 ) , @entity112 ( @entity113 ) , @entity114 ( @entity115 ) and @entity116 ( @entity118 - @entity117 ) led by around one minute 30 seconds with 65km to go			1
@entity110 and @entity114 tried to prolong the breakaway as their fellow escapees were swept up with 19km remaining , but their forlorn effort did not last long			2
the sprinters ' teams were to the fore in the final 10km , with @entity126 working on the front for @entity128 in the absence of @entity130 ( shoulder )			2
picturesque : the feared crosswinds on the route did little to separate the peloton there were nine roundabouts in the final 5km , but the road was drying out after the wet @entity139 , @entity135 and @entity48 were prominent in the finale , with some interlopers , as @entity142 dropped back with an apparent problem			1
@entity144 ( @entity126 ) broke clear as the peloton passed through the flamme rouge at 1km to go on the uphill finish and stole some metres , but he was swept up with 300m to go as the sprinters took over			2
@entity128 burst clear , but @entity5 accelerated off his wheel to cross the line arms aloft , leaving everyone else in his wake			1
after finishing a best of sixth in the previous sprints , @entity5 was a relieved man who will have another opportunity on friday 's 234.5km seventh stage from @entity159 to @entity160 , which is expected to end in a sprint			1
memorial : the pack in front of a @entity166 military cemetery during the 6th stage urban to country : the pack passesover a bridge with a flooded sidewalk @entity5 told @entity174 @entity173 : ' first of all it was a really nervous day			1
we had to stay all the time in front			2
i had a good position all the time			2
' at the end maybe it was not a leadout train , but with all the roundabouts it was not possible			0
' i had a good wheel with @entity128			0
with 250 metres to go i just said to myself i go full now			0
whatever will happen will happen			0
' there was a lot of pressure on us			0
' the confidence was always there			0
okay it was not easy			0
we just said to ourselves we 'll stay calm and go for it			0
' for @entity64 's porte it was a difficult day			2
@entity78 told @entity174 @entity173 : ' it was such a stressful day			0
' we lost @entity197 to the crash , but the rest of us kept out of trouble and we 're here to fight now			0
