@entity0 , 95 , has often spoken of his years as a prisoner in @entity2 - and the terror of cutting camp commander @entity4 's hair on an almost weekly basis there are few people who survived more than a few months living in @entity2 : @entity0 - who lived for four - and - a - half years within the walls of the death camp , is the exception to the rule			1
but in order to do so he had to take a weekly task which terrified him : become the personal barber to camp commander @entity4 , one of the most cold - blooded and sadistic mass murderers in @entity18 's regime			1
in the years after he was rescued , he has had to face one question : why did n't he slit the throat of the man sending hundreds of thousands of innocent people to their deaths at the largest and most notorious @entity26 death camp ? his answer has been searingly honest : ' i thought about it			1
but when i realized what the consequences would be i simply could not do it			0
' @entity0 , now 95 , was just out of his teens when he arrived at the camp 's notorious entrance in june 1940			1
he had been trying to flee @entity36 , to join the @entity36 army which was regrouping in @entity38			0
he was arrested after crossing into @entity39 and was taken in the first transport to @entity2 , becoming prisoner number 121			0
the camp had opened just months before , in april , and he was on the first transport with 728 other young people			2
and then , one day , @entity4 himself showed up and ordered the ' small pole ' — ' der kleine pole ' — to come to his home			2
it was with terror that @entity0 went to the villa on the outskirts of the camp , escorted by a guard			1
' @entity4 ' wife let me in the house , ' he told an audience in @entity36 last month			1
' my voice was shaking , my hands were shaking and my legs were shaking			0
' his wife led me to the first floor and into a bathroom			0
there was a mirror and a chair and within a moment @entity4 arrived			2
he did n't speak a word to me			0
' but i said ' bitte schoen ' to him and he sat down and i cut his hair			2
' in fact , @entity4 would never speak a word to the man who would cut his hair until 1944			1
but he was soon asked to cut the hair of the commander , making regular trips to @entity4 's home on the outskirts of the camp @entity0 witnessed people being rounded up and gassed , watching from the barbers - which was next door to the crematorium			1
pictured : women in @entity2 the day it was liberated but he obviously felt @entity0 did a good job , getting him to return every seven to 10 days			1
even after he was sent to @entity105 , @entity4 would always ask for a haircut from ' der kleine pole ' when he arrived back at @entity2			2
all the time , though , @entity0 knew what was happening in the camp			1
he had been told , when he arrived , that the guards did n't expect people to live more than three months - and even less for @entity112			2
more horrifying for @entity0 , who had been a captain in the @entity36 army , was the fact the barbers shop was next door to the crematorium			2
he has , in the years since , described watching the guards at work - pushing the herded people into the cell , before one of them began pouring powder into an opening			1
tellingly , he was wearing a gas mask			0
speaking in @entity125 10 years ago , he recalled : ' although the walls were very thick , i could hear loud screams from there			2
it lasted 15 minutes , then after , complete silence			0
' two engines were put to work on the sidewalk at the fullest so the screams would not be heard			0
' yet still , he did not move to kill the evil commander ordering the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people			1
he decided not to kill @entity4 - pictured here after he was captured following the war - because he thought the implications for his family and the camp would be too severe ten years ago , he elaborated on his reasons why			1
' all my family and half of the camp would be killed , ' @entity149 reported him as saying			1
' and of course i realised if this silent son of a bitch would go , there will be another man who will take his place			0
' but @entity0 was also privy to another side of the murderous camp commander - who was , he believed , ' an ideal father and an ideal husband '			1
' he was a man of very few words , ' @entity0 said			0
' and he would never actually hit a prisoner			0
' @entity0 eventually left the confines of @entity2 on january 18 , 1945 - moved out by the @entity162 days before the @entity164 army liberated the camp			1
he had to wait to be freed - finally being liberated by @entity167 soldiers in @entity125			0
as for @entity4 , he was tried by @entity36 authorities after the fall of @entity125			0
he was found guilty of murder after a year on the run , and hung next to the crematorium where he had put so many to death in april 1947			0
@entity174 - pictured here next to @entity176 , 81 , a @entity112 survivor of experiments by the sadistic @entity125 doctor @entity47 - was eventually marched out of the camps by the @entity162 in january 1945 , days before the soviets arrived to free the remaining prisoners			0

@entity0 survived four - and - a - half years in the @entity26 death camp
was forced to visit @entity4 's house to cut his hair every seven to 10 days
listened to screams of people being gassed on evil commander 's orders
but still chose not to use his sharp barber 's implements to kill @entity4
' they would have killed my family and half the camp , ' he has *explained*
