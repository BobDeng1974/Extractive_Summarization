in a move that could escalate tensions around the @entity6 world , the leader of the @entity2 militant group called for protests against the movie and said the @entity9 must be held accountable for the film			1
in a televised speech , @entity2 leader sheik @entity11 pushed for the creation of an international law that would ban insults of @entity16 and other religions , citing similar laws that exist to prevent anti-semitism			1
his outrage stems from the anti-islam film produced by a mysterious convict based in @entity23 , that has since sparked protests outside @entity9 embassies in the @entity26 and across the globe			1
arguing for action : @entity2 leader sheik @entity11 pushed for the creation of an international law that would ban insults of @entity16 in wake of the offensive film that prompted global protests ' those who should be held accountable , punished , prosecuted and boycotted are those directly responsible for this film and those who stand behind them and those who support and protect them , primarily the @entity9 , ' mr @entity11 said			1
he called for protests on monday , wednesday , friday , saturday and sunday , urging protesters to call on their leaders to express their anger too			2
' we should not only express our anger at an @entity9 embassy here or there			2
we should tell our rulers in the @entity6 and @entity51 world that it is " your responsibility in the first place " and since you officially represent the governments and states of the @entity51 world you should impose on the @entity9 , @entity58 and the whole world that our prophet , our @entity61 and our holy places and honor of our @entity64 be respected , ' he said			0
in @entity66 , police fired tear gas and water cannons at the protesters in @entity70 after they broke through the barricade and reached the outer wall of the @entity9 consulate			0
the protesters threw stones and bricks , prompting the police to beat back the crowd with their batons			0
the police and private security guards outside the consulate also fired in the air to disperse the crowd			0
one protester was killed during the clash , said @entity86 , spokesman for the @entity87 that organized the rally			0
the protests were set off by a low - budget , crudely produced film called ' @entity92 ' , which portrays @entity93 as a fraud , a womanizer and a child molester			1
tensions flare : @entity66 @entity51 protesters throw stones toward the police as they attempt to reach the @entity9 consulate during a rally against an anti-islam movie in @entity70 emotions run high : thousands of protesters shout slogans during a march in @entity108 , @entity66 , against an anti-islam film made in the @entity9 call for action : protesters in @entity108 are demanding that the @entity66 government immediately end diplomatic relations with all @entity115 countries and recall its envoys to protest the film a 14 - minute excerpt of the film , which is both in @entity120 and dubbed into @entity121 , has been available on @entity122 , although some countries have cut access to the site			1
the violence began tuesday when mainly @entity128 protesters climbed the @entity9 embassy walls in the @entity131 capital of @entity132 and tore down the @entity9 flag from a pole in the courtyard			0
@entity136 , the @entity9 ambassador to @entity137 , also was killed tuesday along with three other @entity9 , as violent protesters stormed the consulate in @entity140			0
president @entity141 has vowed that the attackers would be brought to justice but also stressed that the @entity9 respects religious freedom			0
the president 's response was echoed by former prime minister @entity147 , who called into @entity149 's @entity148 monday morning to discuss the continued violence			1
mr @entity147 , now @entity26 envoy for the quartet of powers , said : ' the film , it may be wrong and offensive but it is also laughable as a piece of film - making			1
urging understanding : former prime minister @entity147 said ' the film , it may be wrong and offensive but it is also laughable as a piece of film - making			1
' ' what i am afraid is very dangerous and actually is wrong is the reaction to it			2
' mr @entity147 said such problems were an inevitable consequence of the @entity172 that has overthrown repressive regimes in @entity137 and elsewhere			1
' i just see a region that is in the process of huge transition			0
there is essentially a struggle between the forces of modernisation , who want an open society , a properly functioning economy , who recognise the 21st century is the 21st century , and then those of reaction based on a perverted view of religion , that want to pull the whole thing backwards , ' he said			0
' when you lift the lid off the repression what comes out are a whole lot of religious , ethnic , tribal influences that themselves have to be countered and moulded into something that is compatible with the modern world			0
' going global : the protests spread to @entity200 as @entity9 flags were burned outside of the @entity9 embassy in @entity203 aiming for @entity9 : by protesting with @entity120 posters , these @entity66 students tried to get their point across to an international audience mr @entity147 said he had changed his view since his time in @entity210 , when he used to avoid discussions about faith			1
' what the politicians often want to do - for totally understandable reasons , i used to feel this myself - is religion is such a tricky subject for us that we want to stay away from it , ' he said			2
' but one element of resolving this is about a view of religion that is also open - minded and pluralistic			2
' and what you actually require for democracy to function properly is a view of democracy in which religion has its place but where you have democracy - friendly religion as well as religion - friendly democracy			2
' he added : ' in the end we need both the leadership within those countries and within @entity16 to stand up and say ‘ look , there is a proper modern way of reconciling religious faith , democracy in society ’ , and we need ourselves from the outside to engage with this process of change in a way that ’s constructive			0
