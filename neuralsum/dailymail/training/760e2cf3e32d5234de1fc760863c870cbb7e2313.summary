' we ’re not even building half the homes we need to keep up with demand			0
’ chancellor @entity55 launched the multi-billion pound help to buy scheme to help people struggling to afford a deposit onto the housing ladder			0
@entity10 housing minister @entity9 accuses the @entity12 of paying ‘ lip service to aspiration ’ but @entity2 claims the scheme , which has helped thousands of people buy their first home , has only fuelled demand without addressing the shortage of properties available , pushing up prices			1

' the only way to ensure more people can buy their own home is to build many more homes			0
that is the litmus test of aspiration today			0
' latest figures from @entity18 said property prices rose by 0.1 per cent month - on - month across the @entity26 , marking the smallest rise seen in 15 months as stricter mortgage lending rules helped to fuel a slowdown in activity , the building society said			2

' there is still more to do , but the real threat to this recovering housing market would be a @entity146			0

' the @entity154 has suggested interest rates will rise before the election , with house prices soaring by 10 per cent year - on - year			2
but yesterday @entity2 's shadow chanellor @entity158 said the hike in mortgage bills was the fault of the government			2
