gruesome stash : dr @entity1 , a former medical examiner , kept human brains , lungs , hearts and tissue in a storage unit in @entity7 for years a former medical examiner stashed human brains , hearts and lungs from more than 100 people in soda cups and food containers inside a storage unit , authorities have said			1
the remains , which included tissue samples and 10 brains , were found in a unit in @entity21 , @entity7 that had previously been rented by dr. @entity1			1
a man made the grisly discovery when he bought the contents of the unit at an auction last week after @entity27 stopped paying his rent - but he immediately called police after opening its doors to a pungent smell			1
investigators found formaldehyde , which is used to preserve bodies , leaking from a 32 - ounce drink cup with a cracked lid - and opened it to find a human heart inside			1
no charges have been filed against @entity27 but officials are trying to determine if he broke any laws regarding biomedical waste and the storing and disposing of human remains			0
medical examiner dr. @entity45 told the @entity46 the remains appear to be from private autopsies @entity27 performed at local funeral homes between 1997 and 2007			1
' it ’s a horrible thing to know that your uncle ’s brain is sitting in some storage shed that got sold at an auction , ' dr. @entity45 said			0
@entity1 worked at the medical examiner 's office from 1997 until 2003 , when he was fired for failing to complete autopsy reports			1
he also conducted private autopsies in the area			0
@entity63 , director of the @entity64 , added : ' how horrible it is for the families of these deceased to think that someone 's loved one 's organs are basically rotting away in a storage unit somewhere			2
' the medical examiner 's office is now cross-referencing names in their database during that time period to try to locate exactly where the organs came from , @entity63 said			1
scene : the organs were discovered when @entity27 's unit at @entity79 's @entity78 , pictured , was auctioned off			2
the new renter noticed a pungent smell inside and called authorities @entity45 added there is a good chance that none of remains are from cases that @entity27 handled as a medical examiner as the numbering system he used was not the same as their office			1
officials are also trying to find relatives of the victims , but admit they could struggle			0
' the unfortunate thing is several of the tissue buckets and several of the brains do n’t have any labels on them at all , so we have no idea who they would have belonged to , ' she said			0
it is not known why @entity27 was storing the organs there ; @entity63 said it is unlikely he was selling them as they were so crudely preserved			0
some were in @entity112 containers and ' a lot of those containers were emptied because they had cracked through so all of those caustic chemicals were leaking out somewhere , ' @entity63 said			1
@entity116 , the company that runs the unit , said @entity27 claimed he would use the space to keep household goods and office furniture there			0
' we never had any indication that anything was out of the ordinary , nor did anyone on our management team ever notice anything amiss during daily property checks , ' @entity122 , vice president of corporate communications , said			0
unsettling : the organs had been stored in formaldehyde solution , as seen in this file picture , but in many cases it had leaked out of the food containers			2
officals are now trying to identify the victims state attorney @entity140 added : ' we ’re in the process of reviewing the facts and researching the law to determine whether a crime has been committed			0
we do intend to talk to dr. @entity1 - it is my belief he is still local - and learn his reasons for keeping body parts there			1
' @entity7 was not the only place @entity27 ran into trouble over his work			2
in 1996 , he was fired as a contract medical examiner in @entity159 , @entity160 , in a dispute over his autopsy reports			1
@entity27 had incorrectly stated on the reports that he had taken sections of several brains to be preserved as specimens for medical conferences and teaching purposes , @entity163 reported			2
he claimed they were ' proofreading errors ' and the @entity160 attorney general 's office found they did not jeopardize any criminal cases			0
@entity1 complained the actions against him were unfair because he was unable to present evidence in his defense			0
his doctor 's license was ultimately revoked there .			0
