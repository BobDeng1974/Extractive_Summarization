by @entity0 weight - loss surgery could be turning patients into alcoholics , researchers claim			1
they say gastric bands and other operations used to treat obesity can make people dependent on alcohol			1
scientists in @entity11 are about to begin a study on 30 patients undergoing weight - loss surgery to see if it changes their body ’s reaction to alcohol			1
turning to drink : a new study will look at whether people undergoing weight loss surgery are more likely to develop alcoholism they suspect it may alter the body ’s chemistry making alcohol seem more satisfying and rewarding			1
a number of patients have reported drinking considerably more following surgery and a study in @entity33 in 2012 suggested it may double the risk of alcoholism			2
@entity36 , from @entity37 , in @entity38 , @entity11 , who will lead this new study said : ' some complications with this surgery are known , but an increased risk of developing alcoholism caught most of us by surprise			1
' it seems it increases the availability of alcohol [ to the blood ] , and , to make things even worse , from normally reaching a peak alcohol concentration at about 30 minutes , it can happen within the first five to 10 minutes after swallowing the drink			2
' hence , the effect of alcohol is dramatically altered , with the maximum concentration being both much higher and coming much sooner than before			0
' he said he had met several patients who had developed alcoholism following surgery			0
‘ they are , of course , not that obese any more , but are dealing with a serious new problem which jeopardises their very existence			0
‘ i have also spoken to former patients who are not abusing alcohol , but have damaged their social reputation because they suddenly get blackouts when drinking			0
’ the most common type of obesity surgery are gastric bypass operations whereby the stomach is made smaller so patients feel full more quickly			1
around 5,400 procedures are performed on the @entity74 each year along with around 1,300 gastric band operations - which also shrinks the stomach			2
they are so effective that patients normally lose around half to two thirds of their body weight			0
switching addictions : researchers want to find out if weight loss surgery makes people turn to another addiction , such as alcohol referring to the @entity11 project , professor @entity88 , chairman of the @entity89 , said : ‘ this is a very interesting study and i look forward to seeing the results of the trial			1
‘ @entity94 can be an addiction and if we mechanically take away or reduce the ability to eat food , they may turn to something else , like alcohol			0
' only last month researchers at @entity102 claimed that 2million @entity103 are now so fat they qualify for obesity surgery			0
those fitting the criteria for were more likely to be women , retired with lower educational qualifications and having lower socio - economic status , the study found .			0

researchers claim gastric bands and other operations to treat obesity might alter the body **'s** chemistry and make alcohol more satisfying
scientists in @entity11 will study 30 patients to see if their surgery changes their body **'s** reaction to drink
fears patients may be swapping one addiction - food - for another
