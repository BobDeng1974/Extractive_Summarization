the @entity6 confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in the last three months of 2012			1
poor wages and dire weather in the start of 2013 means growth is not expected to have returned			1
the news will pile pressure on chancellor @entity14 who was last week forced to admit growth predictions for the whole of this year had been dramatically halved - down from 1.2 per cent to just 0.6 per cent			1
figures published by the @entity6 confirmed the economy shrank by 0.3 per cent in thj final quarter of 2012 , with figures for the start of 2013 due in april gdp figures for the current quarter are due to be released at the end of april , with the recent cold weather increasing the chances of two successive quarters of contraction , which would represent a return to recession			1
the country 's stagnant performance reflects a fall in industrial production of 2.1 per cent in the fourth quarter - including a 10.7 per cent slump in mining and quarrying - and the biggest fall since the first quarter of 2009			0
@entity38 , head of research on @entity41 economies at @entity42 , told @entity43 : ‘ the real weak spots of the economy are manufacturing and construction			2
employment is still rising , but wages are weak			0
the economy is moving ahead but there is a lot of stopping and starting			2
‘ we wo n't avoid a triple - dip recession			2
we are at risk , but we 'll see a pick up later in the year			2
’ in one glimmer of good news for mr @entity14 , the @entity6 said it now thinks the @entity4 economy grew by 0.3 per cent across the whole of last year , rather than previous guidance of 0.2 per cent			1
household spending in the fourth quarter increased by more than previously thought , up 0.4 per cent from an earlier 0.2 per cent reading			0
total disposable incomes rose by 2.1 per cent during the year as a whole , but slipped back 0.1 per cent in the fourth quarter			2
chancellor @entity14 admitted in his budget last week that the forecast for growth in 2013 had been halved to just 0.6 per cent @entity69 economist @entity68 said : ‘ it looks touch and go whether the economy can avoid further contraction in the first quarter of 2013 , and hence a ' triple - dip ' recession			1
’ he said heavy snowfall , which has hit parts of the @entity4 in recent days , increased the chances of another quarter of falling output			0
marginal growth of 0.3 per cent in 2012 compared with 1 per cent in 2011			1
the figures also showed a household savings ratio of 7.1 per cent , the highest since 1997 , as people choose to save rather than spend			0
this figure was boosted by a £ 20.1 billion increase in wages and salaries versus 2011			0

companies exported 1.6 per cent fewer goods in the fourth quarter , while services exports fell 1.8 per cent			0
dr @entity68 said : ‘ this export performance is really disappointing , even allowing for the problems in the eurozone and generally muted global growth , and is a blow to hopes that the economy can rebalance			1
’ the @entity4 's persistent economic weakness has already led to the loss of its prized @entity111 rating			0
former @entity113 trade minister lord @entity114 yesterday played down the idea that the atrocious weather made a triple dip recession more likely			0
