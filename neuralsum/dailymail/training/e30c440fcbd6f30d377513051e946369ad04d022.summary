the following day , the writer was found dead at her home in @entity35 , @entity36			2
she left a note which read : ' i ’ve had enough			0
' now mr @entity27 is now calling for an independent inquiry to be launched following his wife 's death - and says he is ' determined to get justice ' for the freelance journalist			1
mr @entity27 said today : ' we were out walking in a wood near @entity9 when @entity7 slipped and broke her left ankle badly			1
mrs @entity7 's left ankle was operated on several times by medics following her fall in 2006			1
her husband says none of them were successful ' she had to be airlifted to @entity54 , where she was operated on			2
unfortunately the operation was not successful , and @entity7 underwent a number of further operations which saw various plates , screws and bolts fitted			0
' ' she suffered serious , recurring infections and developed septicaemia , which i believe was caused by a reaction to the metal that had been inserted in her ankle			0
' we were advised that she was too young for an ankle replacement			0
in may 2010 @entity7 suffered a severe stroke , which added considerably to her medical complications			2
' by 2011 she was suffering from delusions and was sectioned under the @entity24			0
she had recurring mental health problems that arose from her physical suffering			0
' mr @entity27 says during this time he wrote to @entity75 and its predecessor to try and secure better treatment for his wife			1
but , he said , mrs @entity7 struggled to cope with the pain throughout the process			2
speaking of her final day alive , mr @entity27 said : ' we received an email reply to our latest complaint around teatime from [ an official of the health board ] advising she would look into the matter on returning from her annual leave			2
@entity7 was totally deflated by yet again being brushed aside			0
' [ by 11.30pm she had ] a really black mood , saying she was a burden and i would have been better if i had never met her			0
' i told her not to be so stupid and we would get through this together ... but she was very upset and said she was just so very tired and frightened she may lose her legs			0
' she asked me to help her to bed and i helped her undress and get into bed , telling her to get a good night ’s sleep			0
mr and mrs @entity7 pictured together before her accident			1
mr @entity27 says his wife suffered numerous infections following her accident in 2006 , which he believes was a reaction to metal plates put in her ankle ' just before midnight i took her the antibiotics and asked if she wanted a glass of milk or anything else but she said she was tired			1
' the following morning mr @entity27 said he took the dogs out for a walk			1
when he returned he went to see if @entity7 was up and wanted a cup of tea , but found her dead			0
mr @entity27 said : ' i am now determined to get @entity7 the justice she did not get when she was alive			1
there must be an independent inquiry into the treatment she received			0
' mr @entity27 says he complained to the board about various aspects of his wife ’s treatment in numerous letters			1
the couple on their wedding day			0
mr @entity27 says his wife 's mental and physical health deteriorated severely while the couple attempted to appeal for better treatment he also wrote to officials pressing them to authorise procedures which would help her recovery			1
when he complained to the @entity132 last year , he was told his wife ’s case could not be investigated because the first operation on her ankle had taken place too long before			2
on june 19 last year , the health board ’s chief executive @entity138 wrote to mr @entity27 in response to a complaint he had made about his wife ’s orthopaedic treatment			1
he conceded the first operation had n’t cured the problem , but said he did not agree that metallic fragments remained in mrs @entity7 ’s ankle after the later operations			1
mr @entity27 is now calling for an independent inquiry into his wife 's case he therefore took the view the health board had not been responsible for failings that could result in a civil claim against it			1
one of mr @entity27 ’s many concerns was the time it took for the health board to respond to his complaints			1
last june he received an apology from mr @entity138 for a delay of more than five months in replying to an email			0
@entity164 , the assembly member for for @entity165 & @entity166 , said : ' tens of letters have been written by myself and my staff to the health board about mrs @entity7 ’s case			1
my impression has been that not as much was done to help her as should have been			0
' i was not happy with the board ’s approach and in early february i asked for a meeting			0
i have n’t received a response , and sadly mrs @entity7 is no longer alive			2
i certainly believe there should be an independent inquiry			0
' a spokeswoman for @entity75 said : ' we have carefully reviewed the care given to @entity7 and have been in regular contact with her husband			0
we offer our condolences to mr @entity27 and the university health board will fully co-operate with @entity187			2
' a spokesman for the @entity189 said an inquest was opened on the day of mrs @entity7 ’s death and will re-open after toxicology tests have been completed			2
