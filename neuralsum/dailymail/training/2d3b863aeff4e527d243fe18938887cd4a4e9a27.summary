' i said we ought to go and although he was n't keen , @entity4 reluctantly agreed			0
' i got him on a runaway mine train and all i could hear was him screaming " woo - hoo " , ' mrs @entity5 said			2

they are very popular among theme park staff right across the world , as their age sets them apart from the other 1,500 members of the @entity44			2
' we buy the ride operators little gifts and they will give us special allowances when we go to any of the parks without our group , ' mrs @entity5 said			1
' we have known them for such a long time and it 's nice to see a familiar face when you travel around the world to all these fantastic parks			2

' it 's always completely thrilling			0
' ' completely thrilling ' : the @entity40 take time out to enjoy a less nerve - wracking ride at the @entity192 theme park in @entity129 in 2001 long - time hobby : mr @entity17 is seen on a ride at @entity197 in @entity198 back in 1998 , not long after the couple first fell for rollercoaster rides the fearless pensioners say they will try any rollercoaster , no matter how fast the ride or how steep the drop			1
