by @entity0 published : 16:10 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 11:38 est , 19 november 2013 it 's the start of a $ 671 million space mission that will take almost two years to complete - but the results are expected to show how @entity4 , the planet most like earth in the solar system , lost all its water			1
the latest in @entity9 's @entity4 probes , the @entity10 - officially kicked off this morning as an unnamed @entity12 rocket blasted off from @entity13 in @entity14			1
the first phase , which will take 10 months , is for @entity16 - a satellite tucked inside the rocket under protective layers - to reach the @entity4 orbit in space			1
once there , @entity16 will fire off its braking rocket and be launched into orbit around @entity4 , allowing it to dip down and get as close to the planet as 65 miles from the ground in order to gather air samples for analysis			1
it will monitor @entity4 for one year			2
@entity16 is the first spacecraft devoted to exploring and understanding the planet 's @entity4 upper atmosphere this november 18 , 2013 video image provided by @entity39 shows the @entity41 rocket with @entity42 ( @entity16 ) spacecraft onboard at the @entity13 she 's off : the unmanned rocket blasts off from @entity13 in @entity14 on monday , sending a @entity4 orbiter on its way to study how the planet most like @entity49 in the solar system lost its water but unlike previous @entity4 probes , @entity16 will not land			1
instead it will scan the remains of the dusty , thin atmosphere and watch in real - time how it is peeled away by killer solar radiation			0
at its highest point , @entity16 will be about 3,728 miles from the surface of @entity4 , a vantage point for measuring how much and what types of radiation are sweeping past the planet from the sun and cosmic sources			1
the point of the project is to determine how much of the atmosphere is being lost to space today and extrapolate back in time to figure out what was happening in @entity4 ' past			2
in the 49 years since @entity9 's @entity78 spacecraft flew by @entity4 for the first time , an increasingly more sophisticated series of orbiters , landers and rovers have amassed solid evidence that the fourth planet from the sun was once much more like @entity49 , with oceans , rivers , rain and snow			2
' we see a lot of evidence for liquid water having flowed over the surface in ancient times , ' said lead scientist @entity92 from the @entity93			0
the plan : this artists impression , devised by @entity96 , shows what @entity9 have planned for @entity16 to do once it reaches @entity4 ( pictured ) and breaks away from its rocket shell			1
it will orbit the planet for one year @entity16 ( center right ) is fitted inside the spaceship before take off ' we see river channels , features that look like there have been lakes inside of impact craters			1
' we see minerals that form only in the presence of liquid water			0
' all of these suggest that there has been water on the planet early in time and today of course we see a cold , dry , desert - like planet			2
' figuring out what happened to @entity4 ' climate hinges on learning what happened to the planet 's water and the once - thick atmosphere needed to keep @entity4 warm enough for surface water			2
the information is also expected to help scientists home in on when in @entity4 ' history it may have been most suitable for life to evolve			0
@entity9 's ongoing @entity132 mission is scouting for potential habitats that could have supported microbial life			0
' water is a requirement for life and if we understand where the water has been and why it 's not there anymore we can learn more about what the history of the potential for life has been , ' @entity92 said			0
there are two options for where the planet 's missing water and atmosphere went : down into the ground or up into space			0
scientists know some of the planet 's carbon dioxide ended up on the surface and joined with minerals in the crust			0
unique : unlike previous @entity4 probes , @entity16 will not land on the barren planet , but take samples and analysis from above fire up : @entity16 , is the first spacecraft devoted to exploring and understanding the @entity4 upper atmosphere but so far , the ground inventory is not large enough to account for the early , thick atmosphere @entity4 would have needed to support water on its surface			1
@entity16 is designed to explore the other option , that the water and atmosphere were lost into space , a process that began about 4 billion years ago when the planet 's protective magnetic field mysteriously turned off			2
' the sun , the solar wind can drive processes that remove gas from the top of the atmosphere , ' @entity92 said			0
' we want to understand whether the sun was able to remove gas from the top of the atmosphere and how much			0
' @entity16 is due to reach @entity4 on september 22 , 2014 - two days before @entity187 's @entity186 , which launched on november 5			1
@entity187 's probe has been raising its orbit around @entity49 and should be in position on december 1 to begin the journey to @entity4 .			0

phase one of the @entity194 - was launched monday at @entity13 in @entity14
@entity16 , a satellite that will spend one year orbiting @entity4 , was tucked away inside a rocket that blasted off at *1.28pm*
it will take 10 months to reach the @entity4 , with the rocket shell then breaking off
unlike other @entity4 probes , @entity16 will never land on the planet , but take samples and analysis from above
