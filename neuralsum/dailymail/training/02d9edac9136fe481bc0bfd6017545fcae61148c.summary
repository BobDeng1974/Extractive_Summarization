by @entity0 published : 08:22 est , 18 october 2013 updated : 10:38 est , 18 october 2013 a boy who developed anorexia after being bullied as a teenager has overcome his eating disorder to become a personal trainer and model			1
at his lowest weight last year , @entity8 , 22 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , weighed just 5st @entity12			1
he would closely monitor what he ate , measuring out tiny portions , and then exercise as much as he could to burn off calories			0
he would also avoid mealtimes in an attempt to conceal his problem from family and friends			0
buffed up : @entity8 once weighed 5st 5lb , left , but now he has a six pack after beating anorexia he said : ' i use to do whatever i could to avoid food and sometimes avoided coming home just not to eat			1
i was addicted to the scales and if i was n't losing weight i would increase my exercise			1
sometimes i would go through the day with just a banana and cereal bar			0
' i was obsessed with weight and measuring my food			2
i would eat the same things everyday as my body felt comfortable consuming these foods			0
' @entity8 explained how his anorexia started after he was bullied at school and he ' saw food as the only thing that i could control			1
' transformation : he was once bullied at school and skipped meals to gain some control over his life but now has the confidence to model in october 2012 , he spent a month in a rehabilitation centre for people with eating disorders after doctors were concerned at how skinny he had become and feared his could only have months to live			1
the stay helped him change his attitudes towards food and set him on the road to recovery			2
he then became interested in bodybuilding after seeing how a friend had transformed their physique after taking up the sport			0
he realised if he wanted to get a buff body , he would have to eat more - to give his body fuel to work out and protein to build muscle and aid his recovery from exercise			0
he said : ' i knew things had to change and i had always admired the bodybuilding physique			0
i knew if i was to get that kind of body then i would need to eat and supplement properly so i started going to the gym			0
i took it easy at first and built my way up learning and taking advice from friends and other gym goers			0
changed man : @entity8 now knows the importance of a healthy diet to give him a lean , toned body before breakfast : cereal @entity87 : one @entity89 : nothing or a salad now breakfast : @entity93 : chicken breast sandwiches with @entity95 : @entity96 : steak , potatoes and vegetables supper : a protein shake			1
he will also take a variety of @entity103 supplements throughout the day ' i was doing a lot of exercise when i was ill whereas now i know the importance of resting and eating properly to let the body recover and grow			2
' @entity8 's self - esteem grew as well as his muscle tone and he decided to make a career out of his new hobby by qualifying to be a personal trainer			1
he loves being able to help other people get the physiques they want through a balanced diet and sensible exercise			2
he said : ' i now help and encourage others to beat their eating disorder as skipping meals is not the way forward			0
' he now weighs 10st and said his confidence is ' sky high ' - so much so that he has taken up modelling for brands including his sponsor , @entity103 , and his new goal is to compete in fitness competitions .			1
