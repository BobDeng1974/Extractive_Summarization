hospital waiting room magazines , surfaces and toilets are known to harbour germs			2
but a new study has revealed a little - known germ hotspot : the hospital elevator button			0
research , conducted by physicians in @entity9 , compared the amounts of bacteria living on 120 elevator buttons and 96 toilet surfaces at three hospitals			1
the objective of the study was to estimate the prevalence of bacterial colonisation on lift buttons in large urban teaching hospitals			2
results : the presence of bacteria was 24 per cent higher around lift buttons than on toilet surfaces to find out just how the dirty hospital surfaces were , researchers took samples from two interior buttons and two exterior buttons			1
for the toilet surfaces , swabs were taken from the exterior and interior handles of the entry door , the privacy latch , and the toilet flusher			1
they found that the prevalence of colonisation of elevator buttons was 61 per cent , while in and around toilet surfaces it was just 43 per cent			1
scientists said the kinds of bacteria most commonly found - @entity46 - negative staphylococci - had ' low pathogenicity , ' so are unlikely to make people unwell			2
but , patients may still be at risk from disease , they warned			0
' patients remain at potential risk of cross-contamination because of the frequent use of these buttons by diverse individuals , ' the study authors wrote			0
' in addition , a visitor is more likely to come into contact with an elevator button or a toilet than with inanimate hospital equipment and may transmit organisms if interacting with inpatients			0
' killer bugs : the study found superbugs , like @entity69 , pictured , and @entity70 were among the infections lurking on the button panels the researchers suggested placing more alcohol - based hand sanitisers in hospitals , specifically outside lifts , as they are effective for removing surface bacteria			1
they also put forward the idea of enlarging elevator buttons to allow for elbow activation or installing touchless proximity sensors			0
increased public education about hand hygiene was also suggested .			0

physicians in @entity9 compared bacteria found on toilet surfaces with those *extracted* from the button panels in lifts
findings revealed the prevalence of germs in lifts was 61 **%**
compared to 43 **%** bacteria colonisation on toilet handles and flushes
scientists suggest elbow activated buttons could be safer *reducing* bacteria
