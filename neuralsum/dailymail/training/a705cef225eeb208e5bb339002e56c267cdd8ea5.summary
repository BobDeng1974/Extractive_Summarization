@entity0 has lifted the lid on his exit from @entity3 , revealing that he spoke to @entity4 in the summer and told him to move to @entity5			1
speaking to @entity6 on @entity8 's @entity7 , @entity0 told of @entity3 's trip to @entity10 in his first game as @entity3 manager			1
' you 'll laugh at this but when we were at @entity16 , @entity4 was getting so much stick there , ' @entity0 said			1
' i remember pulling him after the game and said , " this is the club for you , your next club			1
he 's a good manager and it 's beneficial for everyone - @entity16 as well			0
it 's great for him to go to @entity34 ; i would have liked the chairman to tell me they had a chance of getting @entity4 and ( ask ) would i mind stepping down			1
' @entity0 appeared happy at his current situation , admitting that he knew his tenancy at @entity3 was only temporary			1
his sacking , though , did come as a shock			2
' it was really sudden , a phone call late on before i was leaving to go to @entity45			1
the chairman just said it and it came as a shock			2
as things have panned out [ with @entity4 ] , it 's not as much of a shock now			1
' @entity55 , when i was clearing my desk , he said , " @entity57 , they 've got someone else			0
" ' i only wanted this season to help them stabilise when @entity60 [ @entity61 ] left			0
there were no standout candidates			0
i said to the chairman then , " you may as well put me in charge and then wait for a good candidate to come along "			0
' @entity3 drew 3 - 3 with @entity16 at @entity10 , after @entity68 scored a last - minute equaliser @entity4 has been widely criticised by the @entity16 supporters , but will now join a club where he is loved a reason for @entity77 ' sudden departure , just two days before the start of the @entity74 season , was transfer dealings - something which @entity4 will now be tasked with in the january window			1
' i think [ @entity81 ] will [ spend ] with @entity4 , now			1
it 's difficult to get your transfer targets			0
the problem is the chairman is trying to do everything			0
he 's not got round to replacing @entity88 so he 's got a lot on his plate			0
@entity4 is a good manager who will take a lot off him			1
' the fans are unbelievable , so in the fight for survival i think we 'll have miles more than anyone else			0
i can even see them going as high as 11th or 12th ... @entity3 are the best team in that bottom eight			1
' @entity0 's sacking proved to be a decisive factor in kick - starting the managerial merry go - round this season			2
@entity104 has gone from @entity105 , while @entity16 will also be searching for a new manager with @entity4 heading south			2
@entity0 took over from @entity77 , who left @entity3 two days before the start of the season @entity81 ( left , pictured with @entity109 - who played with @entity4 at @entity3 ) has appointed @entity4 the former @entity3 man believes that @entity111 should take the job at @entity10 , while former @entity114 manager @entity113 is a perfect fit for @entity105			1
' you 've got to be in front as a manager , when 's the right time ? i looked at [ @entity111 ] last season and i thought , " it ca n't happen again			0
" if he gets offered the chance at @entity16 , he 'll have to take it			0
there 's a time to move , and in @entity4 's case - and @entity81 's - the time is now			2
' @entity113 fits the bill at @entity105 too			0
' but what next for @entity0 ? he remains happy with the four - month job he did at @entity5 , but will there be another quick appointment for him ? he is , in fact , second favourite with some bookmakers to take the vacant manager 's job at @entity135			1
@entity104 ( right ) was the second manager to leave his post , after @entity0 's sacking at @entity3 @entity0 feels @entity113 , former @entity114 manager , would be a perfect fit at @entity105 ' oh , my goodness ... that is great			1
i 've watched seven episodes of @entity143 in the last few days - you miss out on things like that ... things are not all doom and gloom			0
' it was great to go back to @entity3 and i feel we can hold our heads up			2
we 've given them a fighting chance , they 've got a hell of a chance			0
' i miss this [ punditry ] , i had great time with you guys [ @entity8 ] and @entity163 was great			0
i appreciated the opportunity to steady the ship [ at @entity3 ]			2
the club can move forward in every situation now			0
