by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 04:44 est , 2 november 2012 updated : 20:47 est , 2 november 2012 the new airport tsar clashed with @entity3 yesterday by announcing that all options for expansion are ‘ on the table ’			1
sir @entity7 said these included controversial extra runways at @entity10 and @entity11			1
but this put him on a collision course with the @entity15 mayor , who backs a so - called ‘ @entity17 ’ mega-airport in the @entity18			1
@entity15 mayor @entity3 today said he would not necessarily accept the conclusions of the government 's airport capacity review , which is being carried out by sir @entity7 mr @entity3 warned that going into the next general election , due by 2015 , with the prospect of a third runway at @entity10 still on the agenda would be ‘ toxic and disastrous ’ for the @entity26			1
sir @entity7 , chairman of the @entity28 , accepted that the @entity29 has ruled this out for this @entity31 and that no second runway can be built at @entity11 until after 2019			1
but , he declared : ‘ options after that are open			0
a third runway at @entity10 is on the table			0
’ sir @entity7 will also look at other radical suggestions			1
these include creating a four - runway @entity10 to the west of the existing site and proposals for the estuary airport in @entity44 or expansion elsewhere in the country			2
his six - strong commission will produce an interim report next year on future aviation policy			2
this will set out ‘ options ’ and some short - term action , including making better use of existing runways around the capital and regions			0
but the final report , with more significant and controversial plans for the longer term , will not appear until summer 2015 , after the last possible date for the next election			2
any proposal to expand @entity10 would prove controversial for people living in homes in west @entity15 sir @entity7 said he would ‘ make best use of time in the long grass ’ to give the next government ‘ a flying start ’			1
mr @entity3 , however , wants sir @entity7 to ‘ accelerate his timescale ’			1
he derided the @entity29 for ‘ a policy of utter inertia ’ and described delays to deciding aviation plans as a ‘ fudgerama ’			2
‘ it ’s going to be toxic and disastrous to go into the election of 2015 with @entity10 runway three still on the agenda , millions of @entity80 still in a state of great anxiety and uncertainty about whether or not they are going to suffer from severe noise pollution , ’ he said			1
but sir @entity7 stressed : ‘ the @entity29 is prepared for us to look broadly at all the options on the table as well as some that are not so a government can come to it after the election with an open mind			1
’ the aim would be to build ‘ political consensus ’ which is currently lacking , he added			0
other options he will examine include expanding @entity97 , @entity98 or @entity100 airports			0
critics have questioned the impartiality of some members of his commission			0
they include sir @entity105 , former @entity106 and @entity108 chief , who is currently undertaking policy work for @entity111 leader @entity110			2
sir @entity7 also pledged to look at potential compensation for homeowners living around @entity10 if he backs a third runway			1
‘ we need to look at that , ’ he said			0
‘ we could try it out on @entity118 who lives in @entity119			0
’ so too does former transport secretary @entity120 , who also opposes the third runway because of the noise blight for her constituents			0
the prime minister ’s office denied the issue had been kicked into the long grass			0
@entity127 ’s spokesman said : ‘ people on different sides of the debate have particular entrenched views			0
‘ often those different options and different ideas about how we should approach the issue of airport capacity are put forward without the evidence			0

@entity15 mayor makes new attack on government over ' toxic ' air policy
he tells airport tsar sir @entity7 to speed up and decide before 2015
and warns that @entity146 could cost @entity26 the election
