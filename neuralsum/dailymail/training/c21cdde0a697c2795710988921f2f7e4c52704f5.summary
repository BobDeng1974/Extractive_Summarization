brave @entity8 was best man for his father @entity10 when he tied the knot with his mother @entity12 last month			1
he delivered the rings and smiled for pictures with guests			0
the couple , both 30 , brought their wedding forward after @entity8 was given just weeks to live by medics who were treating their son for acute myeloid leukaemia			1
new hope : @entity23 fan @entity8 with his big sister @entity24 , mother @entity12 and grandfather @entity12 with her son in hospital ( left ) and on her wedding day last month ( right )			1
the wedding was brought forward after doctors said @entity8 had weeks to live but despite the odds of survival being stacked against him , @entity8 has been given fresh hope after being given the go ahead to take part in the trial of a revolutionary new drug			1
last week he started @entity38 treatment , a drug which is administered over 72 hours every 21 days via intravenous infusion			2
the drug is intended to inhibit cancer growth by blocking the enzymes which cause cancer cells to grow			1
if the treatment is successful , it could pave the way for @entity8 to undergo radiotherapy treatment in the future			2
today mrs @entity8 said : ' if this goes well is would give a partial remission which would then mean that he can have radiotherapy and a bone marrow transplant			1
' the hope is that in the end we will be able to get rid of the cancerous cells			0
i do n't want to say it will be a cure , because i want to take every day as it comes			0
' none of this would have come about without @entity63 , it is a treatment that is only available abroad - they helped bring it to the @entity65			0
' it 's very hard , especially at @entity7 , i want our daughter to have a normal @entity7 but with the treatment we have n't had a chance to even go shopping for presents yet			0
' @entity72 acts as best man during the wedding of his parents @entity12 and @entity10			2
pictured also with his sister @entity24 special day : @entity8 with his father ( left ) and arriving in his car with the rings ( right ) the family hope @entity8 will have recovered enough from his treatment to be allowed home in time for @entity7 but if not they will spend the day in @entity84 with their battling son			1
@entity8 , from @entity86 , @entity87 , was first diagnosed with aggressive myeloid leukaemia on @entity89 last year			2
in october he underwent a ground - breaking transplant using stem - cells from an @entity94 baby 's umbilical cord			0
but weeks later doctors told his parents they could do nothing more to help him and said he had just weeks to live			1
however , they never gave up hope and started ringing hospitals all over the world to see if there were any pioneering treatments that might help @entity8			2

it ’s a long shot but we ’re trying to still keep going and see if we can find something			0
' to find out the cancer had returned was absolutely devastating but we ca n’t give up			0
