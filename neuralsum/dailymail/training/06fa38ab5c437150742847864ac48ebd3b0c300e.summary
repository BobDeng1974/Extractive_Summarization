by @entity0 @entity1 visited royal @entity2 on saturday afternoon in order to step up his preparations for next week 's @entity6			1
woods returned to action two weeks ago following back surgery - but failed to make the cut for the @entity10			1
the 38 - year - old , who underwent surgery at the end of march , will be hoping he can secure his 15th major title at @entity15 this month			1
back in the swing : @entity1 practices at the @entity2 ahead of @entity15 good spirits : @entity1 smiles as he walks alongside chief executive of the @entity20 @entity19 recovery : @entity1 will be hoping to get back up to speed ahead of next week 's @entity10 @entity22 believes @entity1 will provide compelling viewing at @entity15 next week , whether he produces good , bad or ugly golf			1
woods won his third @entity26 the last time the @entity10 was staged at @entity2 in 2006 , but has not tasted victory in a major since the @entity28 and only returned to action last month following back surgery on march 31			1
and even though the former world number one missed the cut in the @entity33 at @entity34 and has not played competitively since , @entity22 will be watching the 14 - time major winner with interest when he is not competing himself			2
excited : @entity22 , pictured in 2006 , can not wait to watch @entity1 in action at the @entity6 friendly rivalry : @entity22 shakes @entity40 's hand at the @entity2 in july 2006 ' @entity1 is the most compelling golfer in the world			1
you want to watch and study everything , good , bad , ugly and everything in between , ' three - time open champion @entity22 said			2
' it 's amazing that he 's played two rounds of golf and he 's the favourite			0
if he feels he 's come with the right game plan , we shall see			0
' it 's a tough game to play when you are rusty			0
you learn from every day , you pick something up			0
it 's not so easy for him , he 's nearly 39			0
but he 's @entity1 , you never know what he 's going to do			2
' the old days : @entity1 puts on the green jacket with the help of @entity22 in the 1997 masters tournament woods famously only used his driver once in 2006 , working out in practice that for all the extra distance it could give him , what mattered on the rock - hard links was position and precision , not power			1
the same conditions are not expected next week but @entity22 believes many players will still adopt similar tactics as @entity1 did eight years ago			2
' i 'm sure it will be narrow , i 'm sure the rough will be thick and i 'm sure there will be a little breeze , ' @entity22 , who will celebrate his 57th birthday on friday , told @entity83 radio			0
' there are dozens of bunkers left and right , they put them in so many spots			0
it takes the driver out of the bag for most of the long hitters			2
' @entity22 spends most of his time as a television commentator these days but returned to the @entity10 after a two - year absence at @entity96 12 months ago and prepared for @entity15 by playing the @entity97 on the @entity98 and this week 's @entity10			1
the six - time major winner missed the cut in both events , but was going well in the second round at @entity103 before a poor back nine saw him miss out by two shots			1
' it 's good exercise			0
it 's burning good calories and i 'm curious to see what i could do , ' @entity22 said			0
' it 's a tough game to do a fast - track to become a golfer again			0
on the downwind holes i was motoring along nicely but i made a couple of bad swings and you lose your trust completely			0
' back in action : @entity22 prepared for @entity15 by taking part at this week 's @entity10			1
