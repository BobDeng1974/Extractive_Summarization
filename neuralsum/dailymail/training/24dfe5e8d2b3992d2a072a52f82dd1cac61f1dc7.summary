by @entity1 reporter published : 08:20 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 15:02 est , 4 october 2013 a woman has been rushed to hospital with potentially life threatening injuries after falling head - first off the back of a new routemaster bus			1
the passenger , aged in her thirties , fell from the platform of the double - decker in @entity13 at 7.20am			1
paramedics treated her for a head injury at the scene in @entity17 , near the junction with @entity19 road			1
@entity20 : the new generation of @entity22 were nicknamed ' @entity23 ' after the @entity25 mayor @entity24 , pictured , introduced them she was then taken to @entity27 in @entity28 where she was in a potentially life - threatening condition			1
police are investigating the accident on the @entity33 bus - which was heading south on the route between @entity35 and the @entity36 - at the junction with @entity17			2
it is not being treated as suspicious			2
a @entity40 spokesman said : ' police were called at approximately 7.24hrs on friday 4 october to reports that a woman in her mid 30s had fallen from the rear of a double decker bus in @entity19 road , @entity47 at the junction with @entity17			1
' the woman was taken by @entity48 to a west @entity25 hospital with head injuries which are described as potentially life threatening			1
' injured : the women is thought to have fallen from one of the @entity55 buses on route number 24 , similar to the one pictured			2
( file photo ) the incident has led to a call from one @entity60 to halt the introduction of the new @entity62 across the capital on safety grounds			1
@entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 said : ' in light of today ’s tragic incident as well as concerns raised by disability and other campaign groups , the mayor should order an immediate halt to the production of these vehicles			1
' @entity78 ’ safety must come first and there are serious doubts hanging over the mayor ’s flagship bus today			2
' he added : ' one of the main reasons why hop - on hop - off buses were phased out of @entity25 ’s transport system years ago was that they are not appropriate for a modern , accessible public transport system			0
' the original routemasters were built between 1965 and 1968 and operated in regular @entity25 passenger service until 2005			0
the @entity55 withdrawal coincided with the introduction of @entity25 's single - deck bendy buses , however these proved accident prone and unsuitable for @entity25 traffic			2
despite making up just 5 per cent of the @entity25 bus fleet , the bendy buses were involved in 20 per cent of all bus - related deaths in the capital			0
scene : the accident took place as the number 24 bus headed south along @entity17 , pictured , the incident happened in @entity17 , pictured on the map here in his mayoral campaign ahead of the 2008 election , @entity24 pledged to return the @entity55 to rid the capital of the accident prone bendy buses			1
the mayor of @entity25 hit back at @entity65 's critique , accusing the @entity116 member of speaking without knowing the whole story			0
‘ my primary concern is for the well - being of the woman who was injured in this incident , ’ @entity24 told @entity118			0
‘ a @entity124 investigation is underway but it would be wholly inappropriate to comment further until all the facts are known			1
' it ’s a sad indictment of @entity65 that he has chosen to pre-empt that investigation without knowing all the facts , and instead has used this passenger ’s misfortune to try and score political points			2
' the second staff member whose job it is to guard the back platform comes at a cost of £ 62,000 per bus per year - £ 37m in total across the 600 buses in operation – but even with this extra staff member , a passenger fell onto the road and suffered serious injuries			1
@entity124 also said it would carry out a ' thorough investigation '			1
@entity147 , @entity124 ’s director of buses , said : ' our first concern is , of course , for the passenger and we can confirm the emergency services attended the scene			1
there will be a thorough investigation into this incident			2
' destruction : the collision on @entity160 , @entity25 , left twisted wreckage strewn across the carriageway the new generation of @entity164 , nicknamed ' @entity23 ' after the @entity25 mayor who introduced them at a cost of £ 354,500 each , came into service last year after replacing the iconic old version , which was phased out in all but a few tourist routes in 2005			0
but since the latest incarnation of the popular buses were reintroduced they have been hit by problems before			0
three people were hospitalised last month after being injured when a new @entity55 bus smashed into a queue of stationary traffic			0
the number 11 bus was on its first day in service which it slammed into a two other buses and a line of cars during the six vehicle pile - up			0
@entity124 has confirmed the bus was not following its normal route - between @entity188 and @entity190 @entity189 , on september 21 - when the crash happened at about 1pm on @entity160			1
and in july , the buses left passengers fuming after faulty air conditioning caused temperatures on board to soar			0
heat levels on some of the buses were found to have exceeded the maximum allowed for transporting farm animals across @entity201			0
upper - deck heat levels were recorded at more than @entity203 , according to an @entity205 investigation			0
