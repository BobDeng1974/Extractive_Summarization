@entity111 viewers of @entity2 who spotted his latest @entity4 theme before the presenter 's confession on @entity57 took to social media to share the song titles			1
the first to catch on and announce their suspicions on @entity57 was @ daveboy79 who posted : ' not even 5 mins in to @ @entity120 and @ @entity121 is quoting madness			0
' in a tweet sent to the host , @ zillionairemark said : ' loving the @entity4 references , nice to hear " yesterday 's men " get a mention , one of their most underrated			2
