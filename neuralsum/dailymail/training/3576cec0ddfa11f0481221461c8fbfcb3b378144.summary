the @entity1 sagas of the norse people are 1,000 - year - old chronicles of brave deeds and timeless romances , but how true to @entity7 life were they ? to find out , physicists professor @entity9 and student @entity10 created a statistical network of associations between characters in ancient texts including @entity15 , @entity16 as well as @entity17			1
these were then compared to the characters mentioned in five of the @entity1 sagas , believed to be loosely based on fact			1
this network combines the character associations between the five major @entity1 sagas , including overlapping characters in @entity25 ( blue ) , @entity29 ( yellow ) , @entity31 ( green ) , @entity26 ( turquoise ) and @entity28 ( red )			1
white nodes represent characters who appear in more than one of these sagas the @entity15 is a legendary tale from early @entity39 literature			1
it details a war against @entity42 by the @entity45 queen @entity43 and her husband @entity46 , set in the 1st century @entity47			0
beowulf is an @entity50 epic poem set in @entity51			1
in the poem , @entity16 , a hero of the @entity54 poeple in @entity51 , helps @entity56 , the king of the @entity57 , when he comes under attack by the monster @entity60			1
beowulf later becomes @entity61 in @entity62			0
he dies after a battle with a dragon fifty years on			0
the @entity17 is an ancient @entity66 poem set during the @entity67			2
it details the the ten - year siege of the city of @entity71 , as well as the battles between @entity73 and the warrior @entity74			0
these tales are n't @entity1 , but were studied because the @entity1 sagas are said to have borrowed from these , and similar , stories			1
by exploring the number of interactions between protagonists , the researchers built a network of recurring characters , which in turn helped to reveal if the stories were pure fiction or if they are based on a historically accurate society			1
in 2010 , professor @entity10 and @entity89 studied the historical tales in the @entity15 , @entity16 , and @entity17			1
these tales are n't @entity1 - the @entity15 is @entity39 , @entity16 is @entity51 , and @entity17 is an ancient @entity66 poem - but they were studied because the @entity1 sagas are said to have borrowed from these , and similar , stories			1
the researchers made a note each time a character appeared , and each time he or she interacted with someone			2
they then compared these to data from 18 narratives , five of which contain over 100 characters each			2
these included the @entity105 saga , @entity31 saga , @entity108 saga , @entity111 saga @entity109 and @entity26 saga @entity26			0
these five tales were examined individually in order to compare different sagas to each other			0
they also studied the sagas collectively , and from a network of 1549 individual characters , were able to gain insight into the structure of the overall saga society			1
the network described in @entity17 , for example , was relatively similar to what is known about the ancient @entity66 society that historically existed			1
@entity16 also had references to factual networks			1
whereas , @entity15 's network appeared more artificial			1
the researchers concluded that while that does n’t mean the events were based entirely on fact , or were entirely fictional , they resemble how modern - day social networks function and appear as statistical networks			1
for social networks , nodes represent people or characters in a text and the links denote interactions			1
network theory attempts to show how these relationships are distributed			0
in this simplified version , examples of friendly relations are shown in green , and red connections are hostile physicists @entity9 and @entity152 created a statistical network of associations by studying characters mentioned in the @entity15 , @entity17 ( pictured ) and @entity16 manuscripts			1
these were compared to data from 18 narratives , five of which are @entity1 sagas and contain over 100 characters each they also discovered that many of the secondary characters were better connected than protagonists , suggesting these people were more influential to plots , or in real life , than first thought			1
‘ we can conclude that whether the sagas are historically accurate or not , the properties of the social worlds they record are similar to those of real social networks , ’ said @entity89			1
‘ although one can not conclusively determine whether the saga societies are real , on the basis of network theory we can conclude that they are remarkably realistic			2
’ in the @entity105 saga , warrior @entity182 is exiled from @entity1 but refuses to leave and is killed			2
his friend @entity184 is later burned alive as part of a vengeance campaign			0
the saga dates to the late 13th century , but is set between 960 and 1020			0
laxdæla saga was also written in the 13th century and is set in @entity189 , @entity1 from the late 9th century to the early 11th century			2
the saga focuses on a love triangle between @entity192 , @entity193 and @entity194 , which leads to a feud , and ultimately the death of @entity193 and @entity194			0
in @entity105 saga , @entity182 is exiled from @entity1 but stays , and is killed			2
his friend @entity184 is later burned alive as part of a vengeance campaign			0
the saga ( illustration pictured left ) is set between 960 and 1020			0
@entity201 tells the story of @entity1 viking @entity203 ( illustration pictured right ) in @entity208 saga , written in the 13th century , was set in a valley south of @entity210 in the north of @entity1 in the late 10th century			2
it follows the story of @entity214 and his family			0
@entity214 was the grandson of chieftain @entity216 and fought for @entity61 @entity217 of @entity218 at the battle of @entity220			0
@entity201 was written in 1240 ad , but the story begins in @entity218 in 850			0
it tells the tale of @entity1 farmer and viking @entity203			2
@entity26 tells the story of @entity227 between 940 and 984			0
@entity227 is told he must kill one of his brothers - in - law to avenge another			0
he is outlawed and forced to stay on the run for thirteen years before he is finally hunted down and killed			0
it was made into a film called @entity233 , or @entity234 , in 1981			0
other findings , which suggest the stories may have biographical elements include the number of recurring characters			1
for example , the pair found a large overlap between the @entity28 , and the @entity31 which has n’t been spotted before			0
the @entity31 also featured more interactions with women than had previously been discussed			0
this means previously unknown patterns had been revealed , and because the sagas are thought to have been written using genealogical reports , they may have been based on factual connections .			2

physicists studied the historical texts of the @entity15 , @entity17 and @entity16
these texts are said to have influenced @entity1 sagas , even though they *originated* in @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity51 respectively
they created a statistical network of associations between characters
by exploring interactions between protagonists , the researchers built a network of recurring characters
this was done to try and reveal if stories were *invented* or based on fact
pattern of nodes is similar to those seen in *analysis* of modern networks
researchers claim this suggests some characters may have been real
