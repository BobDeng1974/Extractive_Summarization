hours before their secret reunion on tuesday , @entity12 's high court faulted the acquittal of @entity29 and @entity0 by the appeals court for the murder of miss @entity63			1
the court ruled that the 21 - year - old 's death was a ' sex game gone wrong ' and ordered the couple back for trial			1
this has resulted in @entity0 launching a desperate $ 500,000 online appeal for donations to fund his retrial			1

in an appeal posted on his @entity81 page @entity0 wrote : ' well guys , the problem for me now is pretty tough			1
' i 'm deeply concerned not just for the issue i 'm facing and most of you already know about , but also because i do n't have resources anymore to fight this injustice			0
' i badly need to be able to hire experts , when needed , or pay my attorney fees , documents fees , and so on when the new appeal will start			2
' i hope to not bother you , but i need your collaboration to face this ordeal			0
otherwise i do n't want to forced to give up just for financial reason			0
' i hope you will understand			0
i 'm just asking if you , buddies , know how to build up a non-profit raising funds foundation			0
' @entity0 is thought to have been paid $ 1 million for @entity100 tv news interviews and an advance on his book @entity103 to @entity104 with @entity6 , which was published last year			1
crime scene : this is the flat in @entity108 where @entity16 was found dead however a sizeable proportion of that was swallowed up in legal fees to his team of lawyers including @entity12 's high flying @entity115 who is said to have the highest fees in the country			1
on his @entity81 page he invites potential donors to help him out via a page called @entity122 and on it he adds : ' this new trial will take other 6 or 7 years more with witnesses , transfers , documents , experts and everything will be discussed all over again			0
' i 'll use and certify all the expenses paid with this funds			0
if in the future , i will not need this funds anymore for legal expenses , i 'll donate the rest of the funds to a research foundation			0
' his urologist father @entity139 said : ' this is an initiative of @entity0 's but it has my full support			1
i 'm no longer in a position to fund a trial which could last another two years			2
' witnesses will have to be reheard and there is a good chance that new forensic tests will have to be carried out and as such experts and consultants will have to be paid			0
' we are both very grateful for the high attention that has been paid to this case by his lawyers @entity115 and @entity157			0
' close : @entity6 and @entity0 are pictured outside the rented house shortly after miss @entity63 was found dead as of early today , 31 people had donated with the largest amount being $ 1,000 from an anonymous donor and the total standing at more than $ 4,000 - at that pace he will have made his target by the time the trial starts			1
the site was also subject to fierce criticism with several people posting comments expressing their outrage one woman @entity171 wrote in @entity12 : ' why do n't you ask @entity6 for money ? or better still why do n't you kill yourself ? ? ? murderer			0
' another called @entity175 said : ' scandalous			0
a killer asking for money ... where have we ended up			0
' the @entity180 on tuesday said the ruling was full of ' deficiencies , contradictions and illogical ' conclusions and ordered the new appeals court to look at all the evidence to determine whether @entity29 helped kill the teen			1
in march , the @entity188 overturned @entity29 's acquittal in the 2007 murder of flatmate @entity16 and ordered a new trial			1
on tuesday , the high court issued its written reasoning for doing so			1
@entity63 's body was found in november 2007 in her bedroom of the house she shared with @entity29 in @entity108 , a central @entity12 town popular with foreign exchange students			0
@entity29 , now 25 , and her @entity12 ex-boyfriend , @entity0 , 29 , were initially convicted and sentenced to long prison terms , but a @entity108 appeals court acquitted them in 2011 , criticizing virtually the entire case mounted by prosecutors			1
decision : @entity12 's judges have ruled that the possibility that @entity16 died during a sex game which went wrong needed to be looked at again the appellate court noted that the murder weapon was never found , said that dna tests were faulty and that prosecutors provided no murder motive			1
a young man from @entity214 , @entity16 , was convicted of the slaying in a separate proceeding and is serving a 16 - year sentence			1
in the 74 - page cassation ruling , the high court judges said they ' had to recognize that he ( @entity222 ) was not the sole author ' of the crime , @entity12 news agency @entity218 reported			2
the judges though said he was the ' main protagonist '			0
they said the new appeal process would serve to ' not only demonstrate the presence of the two suspects in the place of the crime , but to possibly outline the subjective position of @entity222 's accomplices '			2
it said hypotheses ran from a simple case of forced sex involving @entity63 ' to a group erotic game that blew up and got out of control '			0
the high court faulted the @entity108 appeals court for ' multiple instances of deficiencies , contradictions and illogical ' conclusions			2
the new court must conduct a full examination of evidence to resolve the ambiguities , it said			2
@entity29 and @entity0 denied wrongdoing and said they were n't even in the apartment that night , although they acknowledged they had smoked marijuana and their memories were clouded			1
miss @entity63 was found semi naked and with her throat cut in the bedroom of the house she shared in the @entity12 hilltop town of @entity108 with his @entity100 former girlfriend			0
he was given a 25 year jail term while @entity29 was given 26 years but in 2011 the verdicts were overturned and they were released on appeal			2
however , three months ago @entity12 's highest court ruled there should be a fresh trial for both of them			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
