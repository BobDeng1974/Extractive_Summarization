by @entity0 a sea creature that looked like a stack of tiny ice cream cones has given researchers new insight into the dawn of animal life on @entity8			1
@entity10 researchers said they have found fossils of the oldest - known animal - made reef in @entity13			2
it was built by a small , filter - feeding seabed creature called @entity16 548 million years ago			1
a section of reef that was built 550 years ago by tiny animals known as @entity16			1
the oldest - known animal - made reef was found in @entity13 @entity16 , one of @entity8 's earliest - known animals , was the first one with a hard skeleton , in this case an outer shell			1
its fossils have been found in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 but it had not been known that it built reefs - a collective activity that helps gain protection from predators and improves food gathering			0
@entity16 , perhaps related to jellyfish , corals and sea anemones , was up to six inches long ( 15 cm ) with a diameter of about three - tenths of an inch ( 8 mm )			2
the discovery indicates that important evolutionary developments were unfolding millions of years before the so - called cambrian explosion when many of the major animal groups first appeared			2
it also showed that reef building by marine invertebrates , akin to today 's coral reefs , began 18 million years earlier than previously known			1

its fossils have been found in @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 but it had not been known that it built reefs - a collective activity that helps gain protection from predators and improves food gathering			0
the reefs - now on dry land in southern @entity13 - were small , about three to six feet across ( 1 to 2 meters ) , and stood alongside larger ones made by microbes			0
@entity16 , perhaps related to jellyfish , corals and sea anemones , was up to six inches long ( 15 cm ) with a diameter of about three - tenths of an inch ( 8 mm )			2
' @entity16 's key innovation was the skeleton â€“ it is the first animal known to have produced any kind of biomineralized skeleton			1
' skeletons have been especially important in the history of animal evolution , providing support , protection and mineral storage , ' @entity76 geoscientist @entity75 said			0
' the skeleton is made up of a series of long , nested conical structures which fit one inside another , a bit like a stack of ice cream cones			0

scientists think the animal itself occupied only the top cone of the stack so that - like some modern corals - a small living animal was supported by a larger , unoccupied skeleton that grew over time			2
it lived during the @entity111 , a remote time in @entity8 's history that preceded the torrent of animal evolution seen in the @entity115 that followed			1
the oldest animal fossils date from the @entity111			0
' traditionally , the @entity111 period has been viewed as a time when animal ecologies were quite simple , ' @entity76 geoscientist @entity117 said			0
' it 's becoming clear that some of the evolutionary innovations of the @entity115 had precursors in the @entity125			0
' the discovery of reef - building animals in the @entity111 adds to that picture of early animals dealing with a wider , more complex range of ecological pressures than we expect for the @entity111			1
' reefs gave the creatures access to nutrient - rich water currents amid growing competition for food and living space			0
they attached to fixed surfaces and to one another with a natural cement of calcium carbonate to make rigid structures and aligned with a current to filter out passing food particles			0
life on @entity8 emerged in the primordial oceans			0
these @entity16 reefs were the earliest know animal - built structures			1
the earliest reefs of any kind were built by microbes more than 3 billion years @entity154 study was published in the journal @entity156 .			2

built by a small seabed creature called @entity16 548 million years ago
one of @entity8 's earliest - known animals and the first with a hard skeleton ,
shows reef building began 18 million years earlier than previously thought
