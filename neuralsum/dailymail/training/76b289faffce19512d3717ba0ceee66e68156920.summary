by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 15:31 est , 24 october 2013 president @entity1 has returned to his favored campaigning style as he gave a speech about the need for immigration reform to a group of advocates at the @entity8 today			1
the president spoke about the need for @entity11 to move past the unpopular shutdown infighting and called upon politicians to unite behind substantive immigration reform			1
‘ rather than create problems , let ’s prove to the @entity20 people that @entity11 can actually solve some problems , ’ he said during the speech in the @entity16			1
watch the video here moving on : president @entity1 gave a speech in the @entity8 on thursday pushing for a united vote following the shutdown over the budget battle ‘ let ’s see if we can get this done and let ’s see if we can get it done this year			1
we ’ve got the time to do it			0
@entity34 in the house including the speaker have said we should act so let ’s not wait			0
it does n’t get easier to delay			0
’ the @entity39 already passed their version of a bill in june - which the president conceded was not perfect in anyone ’s view - and now it is up to the @entity47 to set a date for a vote			1
speaker @entity50 , whose approval ratings dropped dramatically during the shutdown that was viewed by the public as largely being caused by the @entity34 , said that there would be enough support in the @entity8 to pass a bipartisan immigration bill but likely not the one that president @entity1 supports			1
that came as little surprise to the president , as he even said that there is a sentiment for some people in @entity11 that their policy decisions are seen in a binary way : ‘ well , if @entity1 's for it , then i 'm against it , ’ he joked			1
faces of immigration : the president stuck to the talking points but had a hand - picked crowd of immigrants and issue advocates standing behind him and vice president @entity74 eyes on the prize : immigration reform was a major campaign promise of president @entity79 and a number of his supporters have been critical of the fact that it has taken him a year into his second term to address the issue @entity50 's spokesman put out a statement immediately following the speech saying that the speaker does want to approve a ' common sense , step - by - step approach ' but is vehemently opposed to ' massive ' legislation			1
if passed , the proposed law would allow certain immigrants six years to apply for a work or family visa to gain legal status in the country within			1
that is just the beginning of a 13 - year path that is proposed by the bill			2
in order to be given legal approval , they will have to prove that they are not a burden to the @entity20 economy , or else they will be deported to their home countries			2
it will also add billions of dollars to increase border control as part of a way to appeal to hard line conservatives			0
president @entity1 focused on the talking points of the @entity39 bill - touting the fact that independent economists have said that the measure would help grow the economy and shrink the deficit by nearly a trillion dollars			1
he used a crowd of unnamed immigration activists standing on risers behind him to put the personal face on the issue			2
' it does n't make sense to have 11 million people who are in this country illegally without any incentive or any way for them to come out of the shadows , get right with the law , meet their responsibilities and permit their families then to move ahead , ' he said			0
' it 's not smart ; it 's not fair ; it does n't make sense			0
we have kicked this particular can down the road for too long			0
the question of training highly - trained workers at @entity20 universities but then forcing them to leave the country and use their skills elsewhere because of visa concerns is an issue that has been brought up by many business leaders , including @entity156 's @entity155 and outgoing @entity158 mayor @entity157			2
‘ it 's not smart to invite some of the brightest minds from around the world to study here and then not let them start businesses here			0
we 've sent them back to their home countries to start businesses and create jobs and invent new products someplace else , ' the president said in his thursday speech			2
reaching out : the president shook hands with hand - picked supporters after the brief remarks , though their names were never revealed , nor were any reasons why they were chosen facing the issue : the president is pushing for the bill to be passed in the @entity8 this year ‘ it would make sure that everybody plays by the same rules by providing a pathway to earned citizenship for those who are here illegally , one that includes passing a background check , learning @entity191 , paying taxes , paying a penalty , getting in line behind everyone who is trying to come here the right way			1
‘ obviously just because something is smart and fair and good for the economy and fiscally responsible and supported by business and labor , the evangelical community and many @entity203 and many @entity34 , that does not mean that it will actually get done			0
this is @entity11 , after all			2
’ try as he may , the president was playing a bit of politics himself as he had vice president @entity74 at his side throughout the event			0
@entity74 is in a tight private competition with former secretary of state @entity210 to take the party 's reins when the president 's second term comes to a close in 2016			0
@entity216 is widely seen as the one to beat , but @entity74 has been making his intentions known with trips to pivotal primary battleground states like @entity220 in recent weeks .			0

president @entity1 gave a speech calling for the immigration reform bill to be passed through the @entity8 by the end of this year
it already went through the @entity39 in june by a wide margin
stressed that it was *important* for @entity20 to see that @entity11 can work after the shutdown *debacle*
