by @entity0 action : more men should work part - time to end the stigma that blights many women 's careers when they switch from full - time work , an academic claims more men should work part - time to end the stigma that blights many women ’s careers when they switch from full - time work , a leading academic will say today			1
dr @entity13 slammed a culture in which too many able and well - qualified women are ‘ under - promoted and under - paid ’ in their jobs			1
he has coined the term the ‘ @entity19 ’ , which states that most women work at below their level of competence - that is , doing less than they are really capable of doing			2
it is the opposite of the ‘ @entity24 ’ , dreamed up in the @entity25 , which states that men are typically ‘ promoted to their level of incompetence ’			0
that is , a man continues to be promoted until he is doing a job poorly enough not to be promoted any further			0
dr @entity13 , a visiting professor at the @entity36 ’s @entity35 , said : ‘ many women are consequently working below their true level of competence			1
’ he said there are many reasons for this widespread problem , which affects women in many different types of careers in @entity46			0
while some women choose not to be promoted , others are held back by ‘ covert or overt ’ discrimination , a lack of self - confidence and insufficient contact with a senior manager who can mentor them			2
another major hurdle for women is their caring responsibility , not just for their young children but also for their elderly parents who can need as much help as a newborn baby			0
around 2.2 million men work part - time in @entity46 , according to the @entity63			1
they are over-shadowed by an army of six million women working part - time			1
concern : dr @entity13 , left , says too many females are ' under - promoted ' and ' under - paid ' , while timewise founder @entity69 , right , has urged businesswomen who work part - time to speak openly about their jobs dr @entity13 said there is a widely - held view that anyone working part - time is ‘ not serious about their work and not serious about their career			1
’ he warned : ‘ this will only really change when more men work part - time or do not stick to the conventional model of a continuous , full - time career			1
’ dr @entity13 , who is speaking on the issue in @entity86 tonight , said : ‘ men ’s career patterns will need to change too			1
too much of the emphasis on gender equality involves helping women to work more like men			0
‘ it is time to enable more men to work in ways that are currently the preserve of women			2
‘ men need to stop thinking about a career only in terms of continuously moving up a vertical ladder and think positively about lateral moves , perhaps working part - time			1
‘ above all , choosing work which uses their competences but does not go beyond them			0
’ widespread problem : dr @entity13 believes many women are working ' below their true level of competence ' it comes after a report , published last year , found the majority of mothers have never been promoted since they switched to working part - time after the birth of their children			1
the report highlights the career crisis facing mothers around @entity46 , many of whom say they feel ‘ trapped ’ in jobs for which they are ‘ over-qualified ’ and ‘ over-skilled ’			0
around 1,000 people who work 30 hours or less a week - eight in ten of them women - were asked : ‘ since working part - time , have you been promoted ? ’ in a sign of the dead end which part - time work represents for many women , a staggering 73 per cent said they had never been promoted since switching to a part - time job			1
the independent research , commissioned by the flexible working champions @entity135 , only looked at part - time workers with well - paid jobs which pay up to £ 100,000 a year on a full - time equivalent basis			1
@entity69 , founder of timewise and a mother of three boys herself , said : ‘ millions are hitting a wall at key points in their careers when they want to progress or move to a new role			0
‘ doing so , without losing their flexibility , presents a real challenge , leaving many feeling trapped in their current jobs			0
’ she urged high - powered women who work part - time to speak more openly about their jobs , rather than keeping ‘ under the radar ’ , and for firms to advertise if a job could offer flexible hours			2
she said : ‘ many women worry about being seen as less ambitious and less committed if they reveal they work part - time			2
the word ‘ part - time ’ is seen negatively			2
‘ it is seen as a different track that you are going on - the ‘ mummy track ’			0
’ mrs @entity69 said one mother was told to leave her cardigan on her chair on her day off to pretend she was working			0
a @entity170 spokesman said : ‘ it is simply bad business sense to overlook women ’s skills in the workplace			0
‘ the key to ensuring we can continue the economic recovery is ensuring everyone can contribute fully at work , and that means ensuring the workplace is modernised to enable that			0
