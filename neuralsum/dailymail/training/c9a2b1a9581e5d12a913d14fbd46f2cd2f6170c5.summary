by @entity0 it might sound like something from a science fiction novel but technicians at beauty giant @entity5 claim to have unearthed the secret of thicker hair - in the garage			1
according to experts working for the brand , filloxane , an ingredient used in an upcoming haircare range , works like silica gel which is used to fix cracks in car windscreens			1
named ' sol - gel ' technology by its creators , the thickener works by inserting itself into the hair shaft , bulking it up from within			1
the dream : eight million @entity26 women suffer from thinning hair but filloxane could be the solution by contrast , conventional hair thickeners work by coating the outside of the hair strand and can only manage temporary results			1
the new technology , which could offer a solution to the estimated eight million @entity26 women who complain of having thinning hair and hits the shelves as part of @entity5 's new @entity41 range this month , has even received a cautious welcome from hair experts			1
speaking to the @entity44 , @entity45 , a professor of fibre and textile technology at @entity48 , described the new wonder ingredient as a ' breakthrough '			0
he added : ' what makes it interesting from a chemical point of view is that they have produced this glass - like three dimensional structure that gets into the hair because it is positively charged and hair is negatively charged , so it sticks there			2
' sealant : @entity62 works in a similar way to silica gel which is commonly used to fix cracked car windscreens according to data released by @entity5 , using a shampoo with a 10 per cent concentration of filloxane could expand individual hair strands by 60 per cent - an effect that remained for a further 10 washes			1
but it seems that not everyone is convinced			0
in an interview with the @entity44 , @entity76 , the head of the centre for skin sciences at @entity80 , said : ' it would be difficult to see how the highly compact nature of the hair cortex could tolerate an expansion equal to 62 per cent			2
' a key measure would be to see a side - by - side comparison of the hair fibre before and after treatment			2
' it might not have the eye - catching technology but if the claims are to be believed , all - natural @entity26 brand , @entity93 , could give limp locks an equally impressive boost			0
the new range , which launches at @entity98 this week , contains @entity100 maca , which has been clinically proven to stimulate growth by a massive 93 per cent , all while protecting it from environmental stress and reducing hair loss			1
swell products also contain blue lupin , which helps lock in colour , and @entity109 apple , an old - fashioned fruit thought to increase hair growth and reduce loss by 50 per cent			2
speaking about the brand , the famously fine - haired @entity113 said : ' i like using natural products on my hair and @entity93 ’s volumising system makes my hair fuller , thicker and stronger naturally as well as smelling divine			0
' and she 's not the only celebrity fan of the range , which includes shampoo , £ 23 , conditioner , £ 26 , and ' @entity125 ' , a £ 30 volumising styling spray			0
model , athlete and tv presenter @entity127 , is also a fan and says it has given her fine hair an impressive boost			0
' i have struggled with fine thin hair for my entire life			0
after using the swell 3 - step system for 3 months my hair feels fuller , thicker , and has been left in incredible condition			0
