a @entity1 homeowner was shocked to discover a naked neighbor performing sexual acts on her ' aggressive ' female pit bull in her backyard while raving about @entity6 and @entity7			1
the disturbing incident took place last thursday at the @entity11 home of @entity12 , who came to her dog 's defense by grabbing her gun and pointing it at the 22 - year - old intruder			1
but the man , who is believed to be mentally ill , was not impressed by @entity12 's show of force			1
at one point , @entity12 told the station wtnh the naked intruder declared himself to be the anti-christ , spread out his arms and started coming at her			1
a police officer eventually responded to the scene and chased off the suspect			0
he was later captured and taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation			2
speaking to the station , the shaken mother of two said when she first spotted a stranger lying prostrate under her 12 - year - old pit bull , her initial thought was that the aggressive rescue dog had killed someone who had wandered into the yard			1
but when she came closer to the animal , who is kept tethered to the porch by an 800 - pound tow chain , she discovered that a naked man was raping the pooch inside a circle of his discarded clothing			0
‘ i had a citronella candle and i threw it at him , screaming , ‘ get off my dog , you have to get out of here			0
’ he said , ‘ no ! today is the day we are going to spend the rest of our lives together , ” ’ ms @entity12 recalled			0
disturbing : the 22 - year - old suspect claimed he had infected @entity23 with @entity7 @entity75 : @entity12 marveled at how the neighbor was able to come near the pit bull , whom she described as very aggressive the 22 - year - old suspect was described as prancing around the yard in the buff and making incoherent statements			1
‘ ” today is the day ! ” and “ i am the anti-christ and you ’re going to die with me , ” ’ @entity12 told the @entity83			2
‘ he kept saying he was with @entity6 and he had @entity7 , that he gave the dog @entity7			1
’ ms @entity12 ran inside the house to grab her gun , which she leveled at the intruder in a bid to scare him off			1
‘ he kept saying this is the plan , that we were going to die today in a massacre			0
he did n’t seem to care that i had the gun , and i kept it down , ’ she said			0
‘ then i gave him a warning and shot the gun to the right into the dirt			0
’ on the road to recovery : the pet has been giving antibiotics and is said to be doing fine			0
but the gunfire did nothing to deter the crazed neighbor , who proceeded to advance on @entity12 with his arms outstretched , urging her to kill him but warning her that as soon as he was dead , everyone else would follow			2
‘ honestly , the whole time i thought there was a bomb or gun and he was going to take it out and do a massacre , ’ @entity12 said			2
as someone who has worked in the mental health field for many years , @entity12 said she was scared for her life but also filled with compassion for the intruder who clearly needed help			2
all the while , an emotional @entity12 said she had one thought running through her mind : ' lord , do n't let me shoot him … do n't let me take somebody 's life			0
' when a police officer arrived on the scene , he spotted the 22 - year - old suspect lurking in the bushes and ordered him to come forward , but the man bolted ' like a gazelle ' and took off running barefoot			1
he was apprehended after a two - hour search and taken to a hospital			1
the man now faces charges of animal cruelty , sexual assault and breach of peace			0
when police searched the man 's discarded belongings , they found bizarre notes that read , ' now , now , now , ' police ‘ external ’ and ‘ internal			0
’ @entity12 said she had never met the man in person until last thursday , but she knew his family and even cared for one of his relatives at one time			0
as far @entity23 , the plump 12 - year - old canine has been given antibiotics as a precaution and is said to be doing fine .			1
