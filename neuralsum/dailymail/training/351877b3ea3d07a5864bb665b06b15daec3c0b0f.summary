by @entity0 an amateur astronomer has captured incredible images of space - from his garden shed			2
@entity5 , 31 , took advantage of several rare clear nights to peer into the night sky using his telescopes			1
he took a number of images , captured over four days , and was amazed by the stunning pictures that emerged			2
astronomer @entity13 took photos from his home in @entity16 , @entity17 over the course of four days			1
among the images was the @entity20 ( pictured ) , that looks as it was taken by a @entity23 probe mr @entity5 , from @entity24 , @entity25 , said : ' it is not very often i use my telescope because we do not get very many clear nights here			1
' i use the equipment at my parents ’ home in @entity16 for better views			1
' it can take four nights to capture one image			2
the raw data then goes onto the computer and using different software it [ is translated into one large ] photo			2
' mr @entity5 captured stunning pictures of the @entity20 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and the moon during his all - night viewing using several of his @entity49 telescopes			1
desolate : the photographer also captured an incredibly detailed image of the moon ( pictured ) , revealing its incredibly pock - marked surface @entity54 struck : this image of the @entity44 was taken from @entity5 's parent 's home in @entity16 , @entity17			1
the @entity44 , meanwhile , is located about 9,200 light years from @entity58 and , remarkably , almost 1,000 light years above the plane of the galaxy @entity20 - 1,800 light years away from @entity58 @entity43 - 1,800 light years away from @entity58 @entity44 - 9,200 light years from @entity58 @entity45 - 2,400 light years away from @entity58 his black and white image of the @entity43 shows billowing gas 1,800 light - years away from @entity58			1
the nebula is located within the same spur of the @entity67 spiral arm of the @entity68 as @entity58			2
the @entity44 , meanwhile , is located about 9,200 light years from @entity58 and , remarkably , almost 1,000 light years above the plane of the galaxy			1
this gives astronomers a nearly unfettered view of the star formation within it			0
another image of the @entity45 shows an elongated dark globule within the constellation of @entity79			0
this nebula is thought to be around 2,400 light years away from @entity58			0
striking : this stunning black and white image shows the @entity43			1
the nebula is located within the same spur of the @entity67 spiral arm of the @entity68 galaxy as @entity58 glittering : @entity5 image of the @entity45 shows an elongated dark globule within the constellation of @entity79			1
this nebula is thought to be around 2,400 light years away from @entity58 mr @entity5 's passion for astronomy began when he was a child			1
he said : ' ever since i was small i wanted a telescope , then one day i decided to buy one			0
' it cost £ 400 , which was expensive at that time			0
since i bought it three years ago i have had five different ones			0
' i was a little bit disappointed when i first bought one as the views were not very clear because of light pollution			0
' i then took up photography to help me create better angles and help me understand light pollution			0
' i now have different pieces of equipment which help me capture images at different wavelengths			2
my favourite type of photo to capture is nebula			0
