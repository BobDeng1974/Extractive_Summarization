that is when it becomes real			2
the second act of @entity4 's life			1
on saturday he will dismount from the bay gelding @entity5 after the 4.25pm at @entity6 – the @entity7 – and it will begin			1
perhaps it will not quite sink in , at first , amid the cheers and roars , the hoopla and a presentation from @entity14 , an @entity15 hero , as befits @entity4 's club allegiance			1
yet the following morning , when @entity4 awakes an ex-jockey , he will understand there are no more competitive rides , no more races , no more @entity23 or @entity24 or even modest little handicap hurdles to separate him from the field			1
just entries in record books and the fact he will never have to put his hand in his pocket at any racetrack in @entity34 or @entity35 to remind him of what was			2
@entity4 will race at @entity6 on saturday for the last time before he retires after a successful career to date , @entity4 has 4,357 winning memories			1
@entity39 had 4,779 , including five @entity40			2
he was known as the master in @entity43 racing , comparable in his field to baseball legend @entity45 and golf 's @entity46			2
' i liked being a celebrity , if i 'm being honest , ' @entity39 said			2
' when a jockey retires he becomes just another little man			2
' @entity39 was retired 36 years before succumbing to liver cancer in 1997			2
it can not be said that @entity4 has courted celebrity , or that he will ever be regarded as a little man by racegoers , yet as he scurries to his new life , minus its thrills , spills and the snap of broken bones , one can not help but ask : why ? to be a jockey is to live a life of denial , early nights , early mornings , restraint at the dinner table , water at the bar , long , hot baths to sweat out the weight that , in @entity4 's case , lowered his sperm count			1
his children were born through ivf treatment			2
yet not one of @entity4 's thoughts on retiring has centred greatly on the inconveniences or even the pain of injury			1
he does n't now talk excitedly of lavish lunches or late nights , of never having to look at a fractured vertebrae via x-ray ; there is no hint of the social whirl experienced by sir @entity87 on stepping down at @entity88			2
@entity4 will host a party at home on sunday for family , friends and his closest racing colleagues , and the next day travel to the @entity96 festival with @entity97 , as a spectator			1
the rest of his retirement talk amounts to wishful thinking			2
@entity4 simply reiterates he would still like to be riding			1
if he could ride in disguise for another three years he would do just that			2
@entity4 ( left ) and wife @entity104 will host a party at home on sunday for family and friends and why would he need a mask ? that is the puzzle of @entity4 's decision : the fear that appears to be at the heart of it			1
he is genuinely , unfathomably , unnerved by the thought of staying too long , of not going out a winner			2
true , @entity118 was relegated in his final season at @entity120 , @entity122 's last comeback of four ended in an early stoppage , @entity117 travelled to pitifully obscure outposts trying to cling on to what remained of his professional career			2
yet , another year of @entity4 ? another year of the man who currently leads the @entity128 by an insurmountable margin ? random misfortune aside , we know full well what would happen if he stayed on another year			1
he would be champion jockey a 21st time			1
to put this view into perspective , the gap between @entity4 and @entity134 , who is in second place in the jockey 's table , is 82 wins , while the gap between @entity134 and third - placed @entity142 is two			1
between @entity142 and @entity144 it is four , between @entity144 and @entity145 , 37			0
there is no margin anywhere comparable to the distance @entity4 and the rest			1
there is no - one on his shoulder , no - one breathing down his neck , no - one gaining on him up the hill			1
what worries him – that people may think he is not the rider of old – is several years away , at least			0
hence his fantasy of racing in disguise , without the burden of history			0
' i 'd ride forever if i could , ' he explained			0
@entity87 got out of @entity88 at the right time			1
he could not have foreseen the calamitous fall of @entity163 ' first season , but he must have had an inkling that his team might find it hard to retain their title			0
a businessman , too , @entity87 would have known the commercial cache in leaving a winner – the opportunities in the world of publishing , or at @entity174 and beyond			0
here was his chance – and who knows when the conditions would be right again ? a man of many interests , and past retirement age , he stood down and prepared to enjoy life			0
it was absolutely the right thing to do			0
@entity4 is unnerved by the thought of staying too long , of not going out a winner yet @entity4 's farewell is almost troubling			1
' when he retired , they should have shot him , ' said @entity187 of his brother , @entity188			0
' i 've never seen anybody so unhappy			0
' sir @entity188 has , thankfully , since made the second life all great sportsmen crave , as an ambassador for @entity88 and the @entity194 , and a voice of reason within the boardroom at @entity198			0
@entity4 , almost certainly , will find a berth in racing where his expertise will be valued , no doubt with @entity97			1
yet it still wo n't be @entity204 on a wet thursday – it wo n't be the @entity206 at @entity207 , in which @entity4 piloted his 4,000th winner , @entity209			1
for an athlete at the top as @entity4 has been for so long , nothing can quite compare to the thrill of competition			1
for @entity4 , any competition			1
the sheer number of times he took a race on sets him apart			1
in 2001 - 02 , he rode over 1,000 times in @entity34 alone and since @entity221 claimed 160 winners to be crowned champion jump jockey in 1994 - 95 , @entity4 has surpassed that total in each of his 20 seasons			1
there will never be another like him – a fact he wanted to make sure of before retiring			1
it was important he would go to his grave unmatched			0
@entity118 was relegated in his final season as manager at @entity120 yet it is that determination , the desire for the victory no matter how small , that can not be replicated in retirement			0
@entity236 is very serious about his media work and won a broadcast award given by the @entity239 in march			0
his bosses at @entity241 wanted him to make a fuss about it			0
he would n't even recognise the news on his @entity246 page			0
it was clear he did n't feel this achievement compared to those in his playing career			0
then last week , when @entity252 – the club he owns along with other members of the class of 92 – won @entity251 , @entity236 was all over it			0
whatever @entity4 's place in the world from here , it can not compare to the thrill of the chase			1
that is why punters loved him , why his farewell at @entity6 has long been a sell - out			1
this is a jockey who – on at least two occasions – rode winners that had drifted to 999 - 1 on @entity270 at the midway stage			1
he was unseated by @entity272 at @entity273 in 2002 but kept watching the race and , on seeing the other four competitors variously fall or retire , remounted and won			2
two years later , on the aptly named @entity276 at @entity277 , he almost lost touch with the field with a circuit to go , before hitting the front 50 yards out			0
@entity276 had recorded eight straight losses going into that race			2
@entity117 ( left ) travelled to pitifully obscure outposts in the twilight of his career @entity4 's wife , @entity104 , will be pleased her husband no longer risks adding to a roll call of injuries that make the longevity of his time at the top all the more remarkable – and @entity4 's father says he no longer enjoys watching him race			1
maybe , deep down , even @entity4 himself wondered how long he could continue to dodge the big one – the fall that might challenge his champion status			1
' one minute you 're a world - class athlete , walking down the road , holding your head up , feeling bullet - proof , ' said @entity300 , former @entity301 light - welterweight champion , now retired			2
' you 're @entity300 the @entity302			0
then , in an instant , just @entity300			0
' @entity4 has been trying to prepare himself for that moment all week			1
he turned down rides at @entity305 to give him the feel of spare time before sundown at @entity6			1
he is not looking forward to the weekend after , when he feels it will truly hit home			0
' a lot of people wanted me to go to @entity305 , ' @entity4 said , ' but if i went to @entity305 i could think ' why not do one more week at @entity96 ? ' a lot of days i wish i was n't doing it , that i had n't said it			1
but i 'm not changing my mind			0
i 'm too stubborn for that			0
' legendary manager sir @entity87 got out of @entity88 at the right time he leaves having transformed his sport , having helped create four - day festivals that capture the imagination like at no time in history			1
he leaves having dominated for 20 years – a feat unparalleled , setting records that will not be so much as glimpsed at a distance , let alone challenged in his lifetime			0
and he leaves sounding every bit as certain as @entity328 quarterback @entity327 did in 2008 , bringing the curtain down on a career of similar achievement			0
' i 've given everything i can possibly give to this organisation , ' @entity327 said			0
' i do n't think i have anything left to give			0
as hard as it is for me to say , it 's over			0
i will wonder if i made the wrong decision			0
i 'm sure on sundays i will say i could be doing that or i should be doing that			0
but all good things must come to an end			0
' the world agreed , and wished him well			0
the next year , he was back .			0

@entity4 finished well ahead of rivals in @entity128
there is no - one on his shoulder , no - one breathing down his neck
he will race at @entity6 for the last time before retiring on saturday
