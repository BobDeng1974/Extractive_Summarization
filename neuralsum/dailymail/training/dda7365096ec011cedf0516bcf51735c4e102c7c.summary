he and @entity8 met almost two years ago at a support group for transgendered teenagers and bonded through their shared stories			1
while @entity8 has fully transitioned , thanks to a $ 35,000 donation form an anonymous donor who read her story in a local newspaper , @entity30 is still awaiting sex - change surgery			1

@entity30 's mother , @entity123 said : ' seeing @entity8 go through her surgery was helpful to @entity30			1
' it was being around it and seeing her getting to transform			0
and being a couple at the time was i think just the cherry on the cake			0

' but i got the chance to open her eyes and show her i 'm still a good person			0
i 'm still the person i was , i just look different			0
' she was gone for a while but then she came back			0
' it taught me that the people who really love you need some time , but they 'll always come back around			0
' after he began dressing as a boy , @entity30 also lost a new male friend who learned about his past as a girl			1
' he said : '' i pictured you as a girl , and i ca n't do it anymore , '' ' said @entity30 , adding : ' you ca n't just force people to be your friends			2
