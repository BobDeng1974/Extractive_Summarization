@entity0 was born in a boat			1
his mother was trying to make it from her home on the island of @entity6 , only a mile across the @entity7 , to the mainland			2
but she was too late			2
and so a boy came into this world at sea , and there was only one life he was fated to live			2
a snooze in the sunshine : the @entity17 hotel is a fine escape zone for family holidays today , tall and bronzed , like a warrior from the legions of @entity23 , @entity20 is at the wheel of a speedboat thrumming across the sparkling seas off the @entity28 peninsula in north - eastern @entity29			1
as we fly along like a turbo - charged bronco , dolphins breach the surface and plunge below , and then a sea turtle , almost 5ft long , slides alongside			1
@entity0 's eyes instinctively scan the water — and then he shouts with delight			2
the man who has sailed these waters all his life has n't seen a turtle here in 25 years			2
@entity20 is the boatman at the @entity17 , a long - established family hotel designed to look a little like one of the many monasteries further along the coast			1
it is 90 minutes ' drive from the airport at @entity51 , along a road that meanders through olive groves and low - lying wooded valleys , into a corner of @entity29 that is a world away from the fleshpots of the party islands far to the south			1
we are afforded the warmest of welcomes			2
@entity63 : the @entity17 hotel occupies a pristine location 90 minutes ' drive from @entity51 set on tumbling levels down to its own beach , the hotel is a labyrinth of terrace restaurants ( serving food and wine from local farms , vineyards and its very own olive grove ) , cooling courtyards , beach bars and a large saltwater pool			1
the beach itself shelves gently into water , which is astonishingly clear because the @entity7 sweeps into the bay and then out again every 20 minutes			2
there is a kids ' club , though it seems more suited to children younger than our son , @entity91 , 11 , and daughter @entity92 , seven			0
@entity93 is the man if you want to take out a sea kayak or do some light paddle - boarding or more strenuous mountain - biking			1
taken for a ride : guests can head out on jetskis - although watersports at the hotel are not entirely cheap unlike most dudes you meet at a watersports hut , he has an mba from @entity108 - oh , and he runs ultra-marathons , too			1
he does a brilliant job of shepherding @entity91 on his first sea kayak outing , helping him to steer his boat nimbly around rocks jutting from the sea bed			0
@entity93 has just introduced a specialist course for children , which will see them developing their skills on the water as the week goes on			0
if @entity93 is the urbane young face of adventure sports , mr @entity121 , the watersports supremo , is the salty sea dog who looks as though he might have sailed in his youth with @entity126			0
crucial credentials : @entity128 is an awarded member of the @entity131 group @entity133 blue eyes smile out from under his weather - beaten cap as he waves his walnut arm and asks : ' what will it be today ? ' mind you , the watersports do n't come cheap - € 70 for two people for ten minutes ' parasailing , and € 50 for quarter of an hour on a jet ski			1
but , hey , you 're on holiday			0
while @entity148 yells to go faster on the jet ski , @entity91 chooses the more sedate but vertiginous thrills of parasailing			0
as he is winched up into the piercing blue sky attached to a harness in front of his nervous mum , his face cracks into a huge grin and , despite his legs jiggling around like a demented frog , he calls it the ' best fun ever '			0
a place to let a week slide by : the hotel has a gently shelving beach lapped by the @entity7 this area of @entity29 is known for its astonishing panoply of monasteries			1
prince @entity170 is a regular visitor , spending time in the company of the monks in the @entity174 monastery , which crouches on top of a rock high above the sea			0
such is said to be @entity170 's fascination with the @entity180 religion that he has installed byzantine art in his @entity183 garden			0
far above the twinkling domes , on the peak of @entity28 itself , sits a stone building			1
who would build a chapel on top of a mountain 6,000ft high , i wonder out loud ? ' they have faith , ' @entity0 tells me later			0
then , he recounts the story of the monk who tumbled over a cliff face and plunged 150 metres straight down			0
surely , his fellows thought , he is dead			0
but he dusted himself off and trundled back up the hill			0
miraculous , you might say			0
a view like few others : the @entity174 monastery towers some 800 feet above the @entity7 one morning , @entity93 takes us boys on bikes into the town of @entity207 - where an ancient watchtower stands sentinel above seafront tavernas			1
then we head out along a gravel track			0
here , trees heavy with wild figs strain over the roadside and olive trees offer dappled corners of shade			0
and at the end of the path ? a monastery which is probably 10th century , and the first of all those built along this peninsula			1
it is a reminder of the history which seeps through the earth in this land - and courses through the veins of @entity229 and the other descendants of the ancients who shaped this @entity29 marvel			1
seven nights at @entity234 ( 0030 23770 311014 , www.eaglespalace.gr ) for a family of four costs from £ 1,628 on a half - board basis , including flights and transfers .			1
