by @entity0 published : 06:47 est , 23 january 2013 updated : 19:35 est , 23 january 2013 changes : supercop @entity2 , pictured running @entity4 police , says he would love to run the @entity5 as @entity6 is changing rules to allow foreigners to run @entity10 forces @entity12 supercop @entity2 has revealed that he wants to be the first foreigner to run the @entity5			1
mr @entity2 , who tackled gang crime and reformed policing in @entity16 and @entity4 , was courted by @entity17 to run @entity18 in 2011 , but was blocked from applying because of concerns about appointing a foreigner to a post with national security responsibilities			1
however , home secretary @entity23 intends to change the law to allow foreign candidates to apply for top policing jobs in @entity10			1
that will pave the way for a renewed interest in mr @entity2 , 65 , who said that leading the @entity5 is ‘ the only job ’ that interests him in the @entity10			1
the move will unsettle @entity32 , @entity5 commissioner since september 2011 , who has faced criticism over his handling of the ‘ plebgate ’ affair involving former chief whip @entity37			1
mr @entity2 , who was consulted by mr @entity17 over tackling gangs after the summer riots in 2011 , was credited with halving the murder rate in @entity16 and cutting violent crime in @entity4			1
he advocates a zero - tolerance approach to policing			0
he said running the @entity5 was a unique and internationally important post			1
‘ there are three @entity47 police agencies that have great significance in international policing – @entity50 , @entity16 and @entity4 , ’ he said			1
‘ i ’ve had the privilege of leading the two police departments in the @entity12 that have that international impact and that is something that is part of my interest in the @entity5			1
’ a consultation period on mrs may ’s proposed police recruitment reforms will begin next week			0
the proposals will also suggest allowing talented recruits to join police forces at inspector and superintendent level instead of having to work their way up from the rank of constable			2
fear : the @entity50 riots , which spread across the @entity10 , shocked the nation and @entity2 's track - record in @entity4 and @entity16 is seen an ideal way to prevent a repeat friends : @entity5 chief @entity32 listens as @entity2 speaks in @entity50 after the 2011 riots , sharing his expertise on crushing gangs @entity2 was credited with cutting crime in both @entity16 and @entity4 - including halving the @entity78 's murder rate and violent crime in the @entity4			1
the ' supercop ' is the only person to ever serve as chief executive of @entity83 and @entity84 and his international reputation was established when he re-engineered police departments in the 1990s			0
he advocated a ' zero tolerance ' approach to policing and believed all offences - however small - should be investigated			0
mr @entity2 stood by the ' broken windows ' philosophy which argues minor criminal damage impacts on morale in an area which can lead to an increase in crime			1
explaining it he said : ' @entity99 is the theory first put forward by two academics in the early @entity102			0
by cracking down on minor quality - of - life crimes – such as graffiti or breaking windows – police can reduce serious crime as well			0
' in a country that loves gardening ( @entity10 ) , you fully appreciate the idea if you do n’t weed a garden , that garden is going to be destroyed – the weeds are going to overrun it			1
' from 1996 he worked in the private sector and formed his own private consulting company			0
he is a @entity120 @entity119 veteran and began his policing career in 1970 with the @entity122 rising to superintendent of police in just 10 years			0
mr @entity2 was police chief in @entity124 , @entity16 and @entity4 and won acclaim for his zero - tolerance policy to beating crime			1
the prime minister wanted him to replace sir @entity129 but instead brought in as an adviser on gangs after riots tore through @entity10 's major cities in the summer of 2011			1
at the heart of @entity2 's policing tactics are the use of injunctions , which restrict the movements of those accused of being in gangs or involved in organised crime			2
he also uses the ' broken windows ' theory - where he demands every crime should be investigated , however small , as he believes it will also reduce more serious crimes too			0
in using injunctions he widened their use so , for example , criminals could not congregate at certain times of day or in certain areas and could not carry mobile phones if it was proved they are being used to further criminal activity			0
gang injunctions are brought under civil law , as opposed to criminal law , allowing police to use a lower burden of proof to get one			0
much of his theory was adopted to create @entity165 in @entity10 , which did not go as far as his tactics and not enforced as strictly			2
they were then scrapped last year as they were considered too weak			0
in a piece for the @entity170 during the riots mr @entity2 wrote : ' i know about gangs			2
i understand the way they operate , the fear they generate and the urgent need for the government to tackle them head on			0
' in more than 30 years as the chief of police in three of @entity12 ’s most troubled cities , @entity16 , @entity4 and @entity124 , i have learned lessons and come up with initiatives , many of which work and some of which may be applied to your situation			2
' @entity23 will next week open the door to foreign stars like @entity2 , after she was the person who blocked his appointment around 18 months ago			2
ms may was said to have had no problem with mr @entity2 personally , but was uncomfortable with the idea of ending the tradition of @entity10 citizens heading @entity10 police forces			1
however , there has been a sea - change top officers from @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 will also be invited to take over forces across @entity206 and @entity207			2
ministers also want direct entry into the police at superintendent level for ‘ exceptional ’ people from the forces , the security services , industry and the professions			2
currently , all police must enter at constable rank , but mrs may hopes that allowing new recruits to skip the compulsory two years on the beat will attract talent			0
up to 80 of the brightest graduates will be recruited at inspectors level and groomed to become chief constables			0
but @entity227 , president of the @entity226 , said : ‘ we do n’t accept the premise that there is a shortage of talent in the police service			0

@entity17 wanted @entity2 for @entity50 in 2011 but was stopped
@entity6 is changing rule that blocks foreigners running @entity10 forces
now the @entity12 citizen says he wants to take over the @entity5
