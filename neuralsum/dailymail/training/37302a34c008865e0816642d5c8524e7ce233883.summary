half of drivers ignore speed limits on @entity5 ’s motorways and town centre roads , shocking new figures show			1
last year 47 per cent of cars travelled faster than the 70mph limit on motorways , but the government has ruled out doing anything about it			1
motoring groups said the ‘ default limit ’ was now 80mph , because drivers know they will avoid prosecution			1
in 2013 , 47 per cent of cars , 46 per cent of motorbikes and 48 per cent of vans broke the 70mph limit in free - flowing traffic			1
it also shows that in built up areas where the limit is 30mph , drivers are just as willing to speed			2
there are fears that the reluctance of police forces to stop people speeding on motorways could be encouraging drivers to think they will escape a ticket in residential roads , where speeding is more dangerous			1
the government has announced plans to increase the speed limit for @entity49 on single carriageway roads from 40mph to 50mph			2
it follows data showing that 73 per cent of lorries breaks the current limit			2
transport minister @entity55 said : ‘ there are a variety of reasons why it is appropriate to change the national @entity49 speed limits on single and dual carriageways			2
‘ one is that the low level of compliance with them is symptomatic of their being set at the wrong level compared to other limits			2
‘ so on single carriageways the non-compliance level for cars is 7 per cent and buses and coaches 26 per cent , compared to 73 per cent for articulated lorries			2
’ however , the government insists it is not reviewing national speed limits for other types of vehicles			0
the last transport secretary @entity77 announced plans to raise the motorway limit to 80mph			1
but the proposals have been shelved by his replacement , @entity82 , with officials saying it is not a priority			0
almost half of cars , motorbikes and vans break the 70mph speed limit on motorways in free flow traffic there are fears that the ' flexibility ' in motorway limits encourages people to break the law in built up areas where the speed limit is 30mph @entity101 , president of the @entity102 , said : ‘ in decent weather in a modern car at a good distance from the care in front , 80mph is probably a safe speed			1
‘ but 50mph in an old car , on a pot - holed motorway , too close to the car in front is probably too fast			0
’ he said the ‘ default speed limit ’ on motorways is now 80mph			1
‘ one is rarely if ever stopped by the police and prosecuted between 80 and 80mph			1
@entity102 president @entity101 warned drivers now think they can get away with speeding ‘ therefore it is almost accepted as the common law speed limit			1
that ’s why half of drivers tend to break it			0
’ but mr @entity101 warned the flouting of the law on motorways risked creating a precedent in built - up areas , where ignoring the 30mph limit could become the norm			1
‘ if drivers are of the opinion that there is some flexibility around speed limits the danger is that when it comes to lower speed limits , which are much more crucial in road safety , we do n’t want drivers to have that same flexibility			0
‘ driving at 40mph in a 30mph area is incredibly dangerous			0
’ he called for variable limits for different times of the day			0
‘ in the @entity5 we do n’t trend to treat our drivers as intelligent			0
‘ there is probably a good case in some of our urban areas for a different limit during the day time when more people are around and in the middle of the night when no - one is around			0
’ @entity161 ’s shadow transport secretary @entity160 said : ‘ road safety and law enforcement should be a top priority for any government			0
sadly , more than 10,000 frontline traffic police posts have gone since 2010			0
‘ instead of increasing @entity49 speed limits , ministers need to take concrete steps to make our roads safe for all users , particularly children , older people and cyclists			1
’ a @entity22 spokesman said : ‘ most drivers know that keeping to the speed limit can mean the difference between life and death in a collision , regardless of the road type			0
‘ we want people to drive safely at all times , which is we recently increased the fixed penalty to £ 100 for several driving offences , including careless driving , and why we have given local councils more flexibility to implement 20mph limits and zones			0

47 ***%*** of cars , 46 ***%*** of motorbikes and 48 ***%*** of vans break 70mph limits
@entity102 claims the ' default limit ' is now 80mph because police *wo* *n't* prosecute
ministers are increasing limit for @entity204 because so many ignore it
but they rule it out for motorways despite fears it *legitimises* speeding
