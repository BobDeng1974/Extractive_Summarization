the reality of life on @entity3 's railroads has been captured in a series of moving and stunning photographs by @entity7 - born photographer @entity6			1
thousands bedded down on the country 's train tracks during @entity13 of the 1930s , many of whom had no where to go			2
nearly a century on and the tracks remain alive with some of the country 's poorest people or simply those that are enchanted by the romance of the railroad			1
running from poverty or chasing their dreams , stunning photos show what life is like for @entity3 's train hoppers who , more than 100 years on from the @entity13 , are still in thrall to the country 's railroads many of the youth who take to the tracks zig - zag across the country in freight trains , travelling thousands of miles at a time and without a final destination in mind the photographer , @entity6 , now 27 , spent 10 years jumping freight trains to compile his images , which he has put in a new book , a period of @entity46 mr @entity6 began taking the photos in 2002 and covered 50,000 miles and 46 states on more than 170 freight train rides			1
he says he was unable to stop as his life with the hoppers increasingly revealed a curious portrait of the country 's youth , which are to feature in his new book , a period of @entity46			1
mr @entity6 said in the @entity57 : ' i never knew what these photos were going to turn into , what they were going to represent			2
riding the railroads is n't without its risks , as this striking image of a train - hopper leaping daringly between carriages shows			0
the photograph is one of many taken by a 35mm @entity67 in what is maybe the most iconic of his images , a young man by the name of soup mimics @entity73 with an outstretched middle finger while hanging off the back of a speeding train a graffiti artist gets a leg up to do his work on one of the freight trains			0
many of mr @entity6 's subjects used the trains as a way of escape and experiencing the ' free lifestyle and @entity3 adventure ' mr @entity6 has become a favourite among @entity3 's photographic elite , who have been blown away by the talent of someone who was self - taught ' it was intuitive - photographing things near to me , things attractive to me , things that seemed important at the time , but i always wanted to photograph the train hoppers			1
' amazingly , mr @entity6 is entirely self - taught and has stunned @entity3 's photographic establishment with his technical accomplishment			1
' i learned it somehow - training myself and seeing other things quite randomly i wanted to copy , ' he said			0
beginning in 2002 , @entity6 covered 50,000 miles and 46 states on more than 170 freight train rides			1
the period from 2006 - 09 is documented in his new book , published by @entity109 and tbw books despite his success , mr @entity6 now works as a truck mechanic and still sleeps in a sleeping bag every night			1
he still thinks about riding the trains the journey took mr @entity6 to all corners of the country and through some of its harshest weather			0
his pictures are being exhibited in @entity122 and @entity123 this month although many of his subjects used the trains as a form of escapism , mr @entity6 was n't doing likewise			0
' i ca n't speak for everyone but the majority just wanted a taste of that free lifestyle , that @entity3 adventure			0
' as for myself , i was naturally drawn to go and ... check some things out			0
' now 27 , humble mr @entity6 is now a car mechanic and still sleeps in a sleeping bag every night and will only start snapping again ' once he makes a life for himself '			2
a period of prosperity by @entity6 is published by @entity140 at $ 65			0
