in a bid to deter speeding on motorways police in @entity8 , @entity9 province , have placed virtual police vehicles on the hard shoulders			1
they even have solar - powered lights on top , for extra realism			1
@entity17 you believe it ? a @entity20 police car on duty near a tunnel in @entity8 , @entity9 , province however , whether these cardboard cut - outs will have any effect remains to be seen			1
@entity26 , director of policy and research at the @entity28 , insists that wooden police cars are ineffectual			1
he told @entity30 : ' forces in the @entity1 have tried this on motorway bridges			2
but basically it 's a waste of time			1
once one person has gone past it , everyone realises it 's a joke , so any effect tails off very quickly			2
the real deal : this picture shows the police vehicle the 3d models are based on ' drivers are very savvy			2
they can spot these things a mile off			0
there might be an effect for an hour or two , but it soon wears off			0
' it 's like these signs that light up to tell motorists to slow down			0
these things do n't really work			0
' and the carboard cutouts could be distracting			0
if you put them in the wrong place you could be causing more problems than you 're solving			1
' manufacturing fake items appears to be something of a @entity3 speciality			0
they ’ve invented pirate brands such as @entity65 and @entity66 , built entirely convincing @entity68 stores , shopping streets boasting @entity70 – and even entire fake towns			0
the town , which reportedly cost £ 500million to build , is officially called @entity73 and sits 19 miles outside of @entity74 .			0

the cardboard cars have been put up in @entity8 , @entity9 province
the @entity28 says they 're a waste of time
