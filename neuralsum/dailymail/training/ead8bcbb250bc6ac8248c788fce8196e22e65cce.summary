by @entity0 a study has claims that honeybees rely on a built in ' sat - nav ' system to find their way home it has been claimed that bees solve difficult maths problems and that their tiny brains are better than computers			1
and now a new study suggests that the insects rely on a built in ‘ sat nav ’ system to find their way around			1
honeybees make ‘ mental maps ’ of their home ranges allowing them to pinpoint destinations miles away from their hives			2
while humans , sharks and even pigeons are known to use this technique , it was popularly thought that bees rely solely on the sun ’s position to find their way back to their hive			1
dr @entity32 of @entity33 in @entity34 , said : ‘ only 50 years ago the claim any non-human animal had a cognitive map was deeply controversial because it suggested a computational theory of mind			1
the question of whether insects do is a frontier question			0
’ to come up with their finding , scientists captured and anaesthetised honeybees and shifted some of their circadian ( body ) clocks by six hours to disorientate them			1
they fitted them with tiny radar transponders to track their movements after releasing them in a different location			0
the researchers reasoned that if the bees did rely on the sun as a compass , then the alteration to their body clocks would disrupt their ability to find their way home			1
they found that when the bees with altered body clocks were let out in a field in @entity65 , @entity66 , they returned with similar speed and accuracy as those that had not been put to sleep , according to the study published in the journal @entity74			1
although @entity77 / @entity76 was carried to the brain of the honeybee ( stock image ) , it had no effect on the insect , which suggests the highly selective spider venom toxin does not interact with the calcium channels in the bee bees can solve complex mathematical problems which keep computers busy for days , a 2010 study showed			2
the tiny insects learn to fly the shortest possible route between flowers discovered in random order			0
effectively , they are capable of solving the ' travelling salesman problem ' - unlike any other animal known besides humans , scientists said			2
the classic conundrum involves finding the shortest route that allows a travelling salesman to call at all the locations he has to visit			0
computers solve the problem by comparing the length of all possible routes and choosing the one that is shortest			0
bees manage to reach the same solution using a brain the size of a grass seed			0
artificial flowers were used to test bee behaviour			0
the researchers wanted to know whether bees would follow a simple route defined by the order in which they found the flowers , or look for the shortest route			0
after exploring the location of the flowers , bees quickly learned to fly the best route for saving time and energy			0
dr @entity32 said : ‘ the results suggest bees may navigate by a mental terrain map in addition to learned sun - compass directions			1
’ it is known that mammals can navigate areas by making cognitive maps - a mental representation of landmarks like rocks , trees and rows of bushes			2
but it was unclear as to whether insects possess the same skill			0
‘ the results we report imply the bee is like mammals and birds in that its brain constructs an integrated , metric cognitive map , ’ he said			2
the discovery is remarkable because the brain of the bee is tiny and lacks structures such as the hippocampus , which is used in navigation			1
but the insects must somehow construct a type of map that includes information on directions , distances , diverse landmarks , feeding sources and terrain features to permit the complicated computation of an efficient journey home			2
in the experiment , when the bees with altered body clocks were released , they returned with similar speed and accuracy as those that had not been put to sleep , suggesting bees may navigate by a mental terrain map in addition to learned sun - compass directions			1
a stock image of a honeybee is pictured			0

it was thought that bees rely on the sun ’s position to find their way home
scientists from the @entity33 altered bees ' body clocks to show that they could find their way back from an *unfamiliar* *environment*
study suggests bees create a ' mental map ' like humans and other mammals instead of solely relying on the position of the sun
@entity206 is remarkable because bees ' brains are tiny and lack structures such as the hippocampus , which is used for navigation
