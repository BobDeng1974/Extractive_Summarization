by @entity0 for @entity1 scientists have developed a new technique that could see reading glasses banished forever			0
the operation involves placing a tiny implant - known as a ' @entity8 ' inlay - underneath the cornea in a bid to reverse vision problems associated with ageing			2
it is hoped the painless procedure will combat a condition known as presbyopia , which diminishes our ability to focus on close - up objects as we get older			1
the procedure - which costs £ 2,495 - takes around 10 minutes and involves placing the tiny implant underneath a flap in the cornea it is common among the over 40s and is one of the main reasons we are forced to buy reading glasses			1
the technique was pioneered in @entity30 , but has made its way across the @entity32 and is now being used at @entity33 in @entity34 , @entity35			0
it could replace laser surgery , which until now has been deemed the only long - term treatment , even though it leaves some recipients requiring reading glasses in dim light			1
the new technique could replace laser eye surgery - which can leave some patients still needing glasses the procedure also takes just 10 minutes , whereas laser surgery can last for up to an hour			1
anaesthetic droplets are inserted into the patient 's eye so they remain conscious throughout as the implant is placed under a flap of the cornea , the clear part of the eye			1
it corrects near medium vision by changing the shape of the cornea , with the central section becoming steeper			0
@entity61 , 57 , a school bursar from @entity63 , was the first person in @entity64 to undergo the procedure			0
she told @entity66 : ' it was driving me mad , having to hold books further and further away from me and squinting to try to read them			0
' ' it felt like my arms were too short and i was diagnosed with presbyopia – losing my near sight			0
' it ’s an age - related thing and meant i had to wear glasses more and more which was awful because , being a school bursar , i have to deal with a lot of close work and spreadsheets on computers			2
the procedure costs £ 2,495 and is not currently available on the @entity82			1
@entity83 , an opthalmic surgeon who has completed the surgery on a handful of patients , told the paper : ' @entity8 ca n't stop eyes from ageing			2
but it can help deterioration in eyesight caused by the ageing process			0
the new procedure offers hope to the 32million spectacle wearers in the @entity64 and could reduce the £ 2.7billion a year spent on optical products - including contact lenses .			2

procedure would help an ageing patient 's ability to focus on close up objects
implant would combat long - sightedness which is common in over 40s
would replace laser surgery - which can leave patients still needing glasses
procedure costs £ 2,495 and is currently not available on the @entity82
