it is amazing what you can achieve in sport ‘ in extremis ’ and although @entity6 did n’t land the championship which they craved , they will have learned a great deal about what can be achieved when you really want it — and need it			1
@entity6 were fantastic on saturday and if they can draw from the experience , this can be a fantastic year for @entity15 rugby — and indeed @entity17 and @entity18 rugby , because @entity20 and champions @entity19 were quite exceptional as well on the final day of the tournament			1
@entity6 cut loose in thrilling fashion and they will never be quite the same players again			1
they know now for certain that there is another level they can perform to and the @entity29 crowd know that as well			1
@entity6 can hold their heads high and go forward with real confidence after near miss the shackles really came off and it was really great to watch			1
@entity20 and @entity19 also found a new level — 211 points in total were scored in the three games — to set what looked like a nigh on impossible target			0
very few pundits would have predicted that @entity6 would kick off needing to beat @entity43 by 26 points , which was a huge ask but a very useful exercise in concentrating the mind on a very specific task when you feel free to empty the tanks and leave nothing on the pitch			1
@entity52 jumps for joy after scoring the first try of the match on saturday evening although @entity6 started with the encouragement of an early try , they started chasing the big score a little bit too early and got too loose			1
you want the game too open up a little to create space but you still have to remember defensive discipline and in the first 20 minutes @entity6 missed nine tackles , which is always going to spell trouble against any @entity68 side			1
@entity43 nipped in for those two tries from @entity70 — even if he was taking the concept of going in under the posts a little far for the second ! and that rocked @entity6 back a little but they stayed positive and did really well , firstly to get back in the game and then to chase for the title			1
@entity78 slides on to his right side as he scores @entity6 's fourth try of the afternoon 1 there is a chance @entity6 ’s @entity84 pool will be decided by points difference			1
games between @entity6 , @entity87 and @entity20 are likely to be close which places an onus on big wins over @entity90 and @entity91			1
2 the @entity6 pack are n’t quite as dominant as we thought			2
they need to go up a gear and the return of @entity96 and @entity97 should help			0
with the @entity6 forwards controlling affairs up front — as they did in the last autumn against the @entity100 — i would be confident of @entity6 beating @entity87			2
3 @entity6 have found their @entity84 fly - half in @entity78 and pretty much have the back division in place except for the debate over the 12 slot			2
a fit - again @entity107 would come into the equation as will @entity109			0
4 @entity6 ’s backrow still lacks pace and can look unbalanced			2
lesser teams can be overpowered but is hugely important against the very best			0
the only readymade solution is bringing @entity114 in but unless the @entity115 invoke their curious ‘ special circumstances ’ clause that is n’t going to happen			0
5 look out for @entity20			0
they have taken the long view this year and are determined to peak in @entity120 which is possibly why the intensity was n’t there against @entity6 in february			2
they are beginning to get the bit between their teeth			0
they all stuck with the task superbly well			0
@entity52 was the catalyst for everything good and had a quite stunning game — it was brilliant to watch			0
his second try summed it up perfectly			0
if you look at the replay today you will see that it was @entity52 who took the quick , surprise line - out throw , right back on his line and it was the @entity140 scrum half who finished off @entity6 ’s sustained attack 110 yards upfield under the @entity68 posts			2
it was inspired play , the stuff of champions and exactly the kind of bold , positive play that will be needed for 80 minutes to win a @entity84			0
the crowd got right in behind it all with their support and there was an energy at @entity29 i have n’t felt for a while			0
this must be the norm in terms of intensity and atmosphere at every @entity6 game from now on			2
ultimately , it was n’t quite enough , not least because this was the day — and the ‘ loose ’ occasion — on which @entity43 seemed to rediscover their attacking mojo			1
some of their handling and attacking play was out of the top drawer			0
@entity174 ’s yellow card in the second half did n’t help and towards the end there when @entity6 were pressing hard again two line - outs went @entity179			0
these are the things that @entity6 must still work on but they can hold their heads high and go forward with real confidence			1
@entity184 finishes off another flowing @entity6 move to score his country 's fifth try against @entity43			1

@entity6 cut loose in thrilling fashion against @entity43 on saturday
players know now that there is another level they can perform to
coach @entity195 can move forward with real confidence
