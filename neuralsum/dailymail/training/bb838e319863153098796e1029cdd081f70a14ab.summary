former @entity1 candidate in @entity2 has attacked the ' fools ' who run the party the @entity1 councillor ousted by rebel mp @entity6 as the party ’s candidate in @entity10 has quit , with a bitter departing shot at the ‘ fools ’ who turfed him out			1
@entity2 was forced aside after mr @entity6 – the sitting @entity15 mp in the @entity17 seat – last week defected to @entity1 and stood down from @entity18 to fight a by - election			1
@entity1 leader @entity20 announced that mr @entity6 would stand for @entity1 in the resulting october 9 by - election , despite mr @entity2 having already been selected as the party ’s candidate			1
after mr @entity6 announced his intention to stand for @entity1 mr @entity2 angrily threatened to ‘ rip his throat out ’			1
but mr @entity2 has said it is ‘ time to draw a line under this ’			1
he said : ‘ in mountaineering terms it ’s time to cut the rope and touch the void , and see what life brings			1
’ he added : ‘ i was talking to @entity20 three or four weeks ago , telling him what i was doing in @entity10 , and he said ‘ i very much doubt @entity6 can be unseated ’			2
‘ it was not a targeted seat for @entity1 , but i said i could win			2
but @entity20 did n’t let on and he knew from the off			0
' i think he could have confided in me and told me not to waste my time , instead of me being deselected as candidate and told to quietly shuffle off			2
‘ according to the rules i have the right to address the national executive but i was rung up and sworn at and told to shut up			0
i do n’t want to deal with fools like that			0
‘ there are bigger things in life and i do n’t want to sink to that level			0
i know they say politics is a dirty game , but it is not really , it is an intellectual battle between two parties			0
’ he added : ‘ what insults the people of @entity10 is that this was a deal made during a discreet meal in @entity63 in @entity64			0
‘ but will @entity65 [ a key @entity1 donor ] come down to @entity66 in @entity67 and tell people how their future candidate was decided ? ’ mr @entity2 , of @entity70 , is now backing liberal democrat @entity71 , @entity72 district councillor for @entity73 , to take his county council seat			1
he accused him of simply ‘ looking after himself ’			0
but mr @entity6 defended his decision to join @entity1 and rejected accusations that he had been disloyal to the prime minister			1
he said : ' i stab people in the front , not the back '			0
mr @entity6 returned to his @entity10 constituency last week with @entity1 leader @entity20 amid speculation eight more conservative mps considered defecting			1
he said : ‘ i like @entity89 , he 's a nice guy , he 's actually good fun			0
‘ i do n't think i 've ever stabbed anybody in the back , maybe i occasionally stab one or two people in the front but i 've been frank and straight with people			0
mr @entity6 's decision to fight a by - election as @entity1 ’s candidate - instead of sitting in @entity18 until the general election next year - was described mr @entity20 as the most honourable decision in his life time			1
it came amid claims up to eight more conservative mps have held intensive talks with @entity1 about defecting			2
@entity1 is targeting a host of seats in the south and east of @entity108 in a bid to break into @entity18 at the next election @entity111 @entity10 - @entity111 @entity112 & @entity113 @entity114 - @entity111 @entity115 and @entity116 forest of @entity118 @entity119 - @entity111 @entity120 - @entity111 @entity121 - @entity111 @entity122 - @entity111 @entity124 - @entity123 @entity126 - @entity125 @entity127 - @entity125 after the shock defection of mr @entity6 a source told the @entity130 that the threat of a mutiny went far beyond just one mp			1
it is understood that mr @entity6 was among nine @entity135 wined and dined by millionaire @entity1 donor @entity65 at a series of discreet lunches in @entity63			1
‘ @entity65 is quietly confident that more may follow @entity6 , ’ a source said , adding that the @entity139 were happy to talk to mr @entity65 – a former @entity15 who defected to @entity1 – ‘ because they knew he understood their sense of divided loyalty ’			1
‘ @entity65 understood what they were going through because he had been on the same journey , ’ the source said			0
mr @entity89 was ambushed by the defection of mr @entity6 – a serial rebel – who quit the party with a parting blast that questioned the prime minister ’s policy on @entity154			1
the mp announced he was joining @entity1 and forcing a by - election in his @entity10 constituency in @entity17 , which will be a nightmare for the @entity135 to defend despite their 12,000 majority in 2010			1
mr @entity89 was given no prior warning of the announcement and could only watch as mr @entity20 triumphantly paraded mr @entity6 live on tv			2
the dramatic move has increased pressure on the prime minister to toughen his stance on immigration and @entity154 to stem the risk of further defections			0
@entity15 whips were scrambled to ring round @entity172 mps to shore up support			0
a senior @entity15 source insisted that mr @entity6 appeared to be a ‘ lone wolf ’ and played down the prospect of further departures			2
and mr @entity89 angrily dismissed mr @entity6 ’s move as ‘ self - defeating ’			1
‘ it is obviously deeply regrettable when these things happen and people behave in this way , ’ he said			0
‘ but it is also , in my view , counter-productive			0
’ mr @entity20 claimed he had been involved in talks with a number of @entity15 @entity139 over the past six months who ‘ very strongly support everything @entity1 is trying to do ’			2
he predicted that further defections will follow if mr @entity6 triumphs in the by - election , which is likely to be held in the week after the @entity15 party conference			1
‘ the real answer to the question about how many others will join , will all depend on this by - election , ’ he said			2
‘ this by - election is going to be a @entity200 moment			2
’ former conservative mp @entity6 defected to @entity1 last week and is the firm favourite to hold his seat in next month 's by - election mr @entity6 , an early supporter of mr @entity89 ’s leadership bid , said the prime minister was ‘ not serious about change ’ when it came to the @entity206 and was only interested in doing the minimum needed to win an election			1
speaking at a press conference in @entity64 alongside mr @entity20 , he said : ‘ the problem is that many of those at the top of the @entity15 are simply not on our side			0
they are n’t serious about the change that @entity218 so desperately needs			0
of course they talk the talk before elections			0
they say what they feel they must say to get our support ... but on so many issues – on modernising our politics , on the recall of @entity139 , on controlling our borders , on less government , on bank reform , on cutting public debt , on an @entity206 referendum – they never actually make it happen			0
’ mr @entity6 ’s decision to trigger a by - election leaves the @entity15 facing a huge battle to prevent him becoming @entity1 ’s first elected mp			1
he has built a @entity15 majority of over 12,000 in what had been a @entity123 seat .			0
