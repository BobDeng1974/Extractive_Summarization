@entity9 ( left ) and @entity24 ( right ) have been jailed after printing £ 1.3 million worth of fake £ 10 banknotes the @entity25 and their brothers - in - law , @entity28 and @entity29 , printed the notes over the festive period the @entity32 brothers and their brothers - in - law , @entity28 and @entity29 , were all convicted of conspiracy to produce counterfeit notes following a five - week trial which ended in december			1
the trial heard @entity32 and @entity10 , from @entity11 ; @entity28 , of @entity37 ; and @entity29 , of @entity38 , @entity8 , even worked through the night to print fake £ 10 notes worth at least £ 1.27million			1
@entity32 , 45 , @entity10 , 43 , @entity28 , 40 , and @entity29 , 44 , used specialist paper , inks and foil to run off the near - perfect forgeries at a print - works in @entity45 , @entity8			1
judge @entity16 told them : ‘ people who commit offences of this type must realise that those who counterfeit currency must expect long sentences of imprisonment			1
‘ in this case the amount of money produced and disseminated into general circulation was enormous			2
‘ production of counterfeit notes undermines the whole economy of the country			1
essentially it undermines the whole integrity of the currency system			0
‘ it is so serious that only lengthy custodial sentences can be justified			0
’ brothers - in - law @entity28 ( left ) and @entity29 ( right ) were jailed for four - and - a - half years jailing both @entity29 and @entity28 for four - and - a - half years , and barring the @entity32 brothers from acting as company directors , judge @entity16 said the offences were motivated by greed			1
he told the defendants : ‘ all four of you knew what would happen to the notes			2
‘ you knew that if you were caught it would affect your wives and your children and other members of your immediate family			0
‘ knowing , as you did , the consequences of being caught , you ignored your families			0
the risks taken in this case were high and you must personally take the blame			0
’ the @entity87 ( @entity87 ) said @entity88 and @entity89 had legitimate business contracts but the four men had used the firm ’s computers and machinery to counterfeit notes in late 2010 and early 2011 - over the @entity6 and @entity97 break			1
the vast majority of the ‘ extremely high quality ’ notes even had individual serial numbers , and were only identified as fakes as they were sorted by banks to be loaded into cash machines			2
although the notes ’ holograms were easily identifiable as bogus , the other security features were so convincing that only 10 per cent of them were spotted by members of the public			2
a spokesman for the @entity87 said the men were caught after ' intelligence ' was passed on from the @entity87 's @entity114 for the @entity115			0
he said : ' the @entity87 then used traditional investigation methods including analysis of communication data , phone data , and numberplate recognition to pinpoint where they were working			0
' in a statement issued after the case , the @entity87 said forensic analysis of the printing firm ’s equipment showed exactly when it was being used and what was being produced			2
mobile phone data and automatic number plate recognition evidence were also critical to the success of the investigation , an @entity87 spokesman said			0

’ the fake notes have been found all over the country but the most significantly affected areas were the @entity12 , @entity165 and @entity166			2

it takes money out of the pockets of individuals and businesses			0
