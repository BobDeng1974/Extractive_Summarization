by @entity0 council workers are being told to own up about any office romances or affairs as part of a new code of conduct requiring them to confess ' close personal relationships ' to their bosses			1
employees of @entity11 in @entity12 have been told to discretely let their line manager know of any trysts or other ' close relationships ' after a new code of conduct was brought in			1
the fresh set of rules was designed to combat ' conflicts of interest ' at the local authority , and to give ' very clear details of what is and is not acceptable '			2
confess : workers at @entity11 have been told to reveal ' close personal relationships ' to their bosses ( posed by models ) the code , introduced in march , even extends to people who do not work for the council , but do business with it in some other way			1
however , the change has sparked concerns that the authority could end up prying into the personal lives of staff			0
employment lawyer @entity37 from @entity11 - based @entity38 , said staff codes of conduct are common , but could later land the council in legal trouble			1
she said : ' i can see what the council is trying to do by introducing this code of conduct and i can understand that they see it as necessary			2
' however i think it is almost certain that someone somewhere will challenge a code like this under human rights legislation			0
' but the council denies claims of snooping and says the code only applies when there is a risk of a conflict of interest arising			0
council leader @entity59 insisted the rules are merely a matter of ' common sense '			1
crackdown : @entity11 brought in the tighter rules to combat ' conflicts of interest ' he said : ' this is really in place to protect our staff against claims that they might show favour to someone they are close to - it is really a matter of common sense			1
' it is something that is fairly common			0
we are not banning relationships - but we need to know if they are going to impact on council business '			0
the new code states : ' employees must declare any @entity84 where the relationship could cause , or be perceived to cause , a conflict of interest '			0
' in such instances there may be a need to consider alternative employment for one of the employees concerned '			0
@entity11 council recently pledged to tighten up its staff rules after a report recommended a more stringent code of conduct			1
it said the new ' rules - based ' code would make it easier to ' monitor compliance ' and would give ' very clear details of what is and is not acceptable '			0
a council spokesman said : ' the code only requires employees to disclose , in confidence , to their line manager any close personal relationships where there is a risk of a conflict of interest arising			1
' examples where an employee would be expected to disclose a close personal relationship include cases where an employee â€™s spouse or partner is the managing director of a company bidding for a council contract			2
' internally the code would be applied where two employees who both work for the council are in a close relationship and one is responsible for managing the other or could be involved in selection for promotion or redundancy '			0
@entity132 , @entity11 representative for @entity133 , said the union was consulted on the changes to the new code of conduct and she has received no complaints .			2
