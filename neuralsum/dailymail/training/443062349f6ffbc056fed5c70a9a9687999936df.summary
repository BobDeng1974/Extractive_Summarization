a @entity9 panel has concluded that a ‘ tipping point ’ has been reached and that the very future of humanity is doubt unless developed nations rethink the way they live			1
sir @entity16 , who led the 23 - strong group of academics from around the world who produced the report , warned that ‘ we are reaching a critical time in the development of humanity on the @entity26 ’ and that continual economic growth ‘ is not sustainable ’			1
double trouble : the @entity9 says that developed nations consume too much and that the world 's population is too high he said : ‘ the human world lives in a framework called global economics			1
we live in a system based on gdp , which drives consumption			2
it causes people to compete with each other through trade in a way that they all grow			2
all governments say : “ we must grow			2
” but it ’s not sustainable			1
‘ the strong evidence is that we ’re running out of space			0
we ’re collectively affecting the world ’s climate			0
this is due to the still growing human population and our increase in consumption			0
’ the report highlights the fact that the world ’s population passed seven billion recently and that developing countries will be building the equivalent of a city of a million people every five days from now to 2050			0
food for thought : some people eat too much than is good for them , while others starve , says sir @entity16 sir @entity16 said : ‘ the world now has a very clear choice			0
we can choose to address the twin issues of population and consumption to rebalance the use of resources to a more egalitarian pattern of consumption			0
‘ or we choose to do nothing and to drift into a downward vortex of economic , socio - political and environmental ills , leading to a more unequal and inhospitable future			1
’ he added that some people in the world are consuming far too much food than is good for them , while others starve .			0
