@entity0 started looking forward to his first @entity2 appearance with @entity3 after going through a night of mixed emotions at @entity5 on monday			1
@entity0 sent @entity3 through to an @entity6 semi-final against either @entity8 or @entity9 with a 61st - minute winner that came as a result of a clanger by @entity14 right - back @entity13			1
for @entity14 boss @entity17 , watching the man he sold last summer score the winner at @entity5 must have been hard to take			1
@entity0 was jeered by a minority of fans after being replaced but most gave him a good reception @entity0 netted the winning goal as @entity3 progressed to the @entity6 semi-finals with a 2 - 1 victory @entity0 celebrates after scoring against his former club @entity14 , but admitted he found it hard but it was also a difficult night for @entity0 , the @entity27 lad who came through @entity14 's academy and still considers himself to be a big fan of the club			1
' @entity14 is a club that means so much to me , ' said @entity0 , who spent 15 years at @entity14 having joined them at eight			1
' i 'm a fan and it 's hard to knock them out			0
i was just doing my job			0
' it was about being professional , keeping my focus and motivation			0
i kept plugging away and then got on the end of @entity13 's backpass , beat @entity40 and got the winning goal			0
@entity0 spent six seasons at @entity14 after coming through the club 's youth system the 24 - year - old shakes hands with former team - mate @entity46 ( left ) after the game ' i 'm just really pleased we 're through to the next round			1
' @entity0 's name was cheered by the home and away support when it was read out from the @entity3 team sheet pre-match and he received a largely warm reception when he was substituted in the 74th minute			1
' i 'll always respect the fans , i had a lovely reception from them and i 'm thankful for that , ' the @entity56 forward said			2
@entity3 are now favourites to retain the @entity6 after their first victory at @entity5 in nine years			1
they will be big expected to overcome whichever opponent they face in the next round and @entity0 is looking forward to stepping out at @entity2 in an @entity3 shirt for the first time			1
@entity0 celebrates in front of the @entity14 fans , but for the most part the @entity5 crowd was kind to him the @entity3 star celebrates with full back @entity70 , but admitted it was tough to play against @entity14 ' it 's good for the team that we 're through to the next round , and we 're in the semi-finals at @entity2 , ' the 24 - year - old said			1
' to get the goal was good for me but it was all about the team performance			0
' @entity3 return to @entity5 in the league on the penultimate weekend of the season			2
although they suffered a crushing home defeat to @entity85 in the @entity86 recently , their league form has been impressive			0
@entity88 's men are up to third having won seven of their last eight @entity91 games and @entity92 , who scored the first goal in monday 's 2 - 1 win over @entity14 , hopes @entity3 will be able to keep that momentum going until the end of the season			1
' we are in a good dynamic in the last few games , ' the left - back said			2
@entity92 , scorer of @entity3 's first goal on monday , praised his team 's recent form @entity3 have been excellent in recent weeks , aside from a difficult defeat at home to @entity85 ' except for @entity85 when we did n't play really well , in the rest of the games we have played well and won most of them			2
this is the style now to keep going			0
' we are @entity3 and we have very good players			2
obviously everyone had memories of last season that we lost all the games against top teams			0
' this season we played really well against ( @entity117 ) @entity116 , we won and it was fair and this ( against @entity14 ) is the same			0
we played really well and are very happy for the victory			0
' we want to finish as high up as possible and the best way is to keep going in this dynamic , keep focusing in each game and have commitment			0
we have to win as many games as we can			0
