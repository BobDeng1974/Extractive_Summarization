the @entity1 , who was jailed for nine years in 2003 for inciting @entity3 violence , says the hardline nationalist party should be applauded for ' not carrying out violence , but protecting the public '			1

' [ but ] do you know the @entity11 ? we would like to be like the @entity11			1
not carrying out violence , but protecting the public			1
' the ' 969 ' group was behind last month 's riots that saw intense clashes between its members and @entity54 that left 43 people dead in the city of @entity57			1
and only yesterday , hundreds of @entity0 men on motorcycles waved iron rods in a northeastern town in @entity5 before setting fire to a @entity20 - owned cinema in the latest incident to spill over from simmering religious tensions in the country			1
the intimidating display in @entity68 came a day after a mosque and a @entity20 orphanage were torched after reports that a @entity20 man set fire to a @entity0 woman			0
residents said a cinema was burned as the mob sped around the town as part of a new wave of violence targeting the religious minority			0
odd comparison ? @entity1 says he wants his gang members to be more like the @entity11 , who last week organised a protest in the wake of the killing of drummer @entity29 in @entity30 , southeast @entity88 beer swilling protest : last week 's @entity11 protest saw more than 1,000 of its members march on @entity26 swilling beer and chanting anti @entity20 slogans protective ? @entity1 says he wants to be like the @entity11 because they ' protect the public ' @entity1 is a firmly anti-islamic monk who was jailed in 2003 for inciting @entity3 violence , but was released last year as part of the broader amnesty for prisoners and admitted being at @entity57 , although insists he played no part in the violence			1
' we buddhist @entity5 are too soft , " he told the @entity102 in a recent interview			1
' we lack patriotic pride			0
he urges @entity10 all over the country to boycott @entity20 businesses and hands out stickers printed with the number ' 969 ' , which symbolise elements of @entity10			2
@entity111 accuses @entity20 men of repeatedly raping @entity0 women , of using their wealth to lure @entity0 women into marriage , then imprisoning them in the home			2
but it seems a fear of @entity20 success is driving the discrimination			0
' they - the @entity54 - are good at business , they control transport , construction			2
now they are taking over our political parties			0
if this goes on , we will end up like @entity132 or @entity133 , ' he said			0
@entity5 is a mainly @entity0 country , but nine per cent of its 60 million people are @entity20			2
however , there is an open resentment of @entity54 , openly expressed and they are referred to with the derogatory term ' kala			2
' motorcade : hundreds of @entity10 on motorcycles armed with sticks patrol in the streets of in @entity68 , @entity5 the men became angry after rumors spread that a @entity20 man had set fire to a @entity0 woman people celebrate around the burning mosque			2
an @entity7 school and orphanage were also torched last month , horrifying footage emerged of police officers standing by while @entity0 rioters belonging to the'969 squad ' set fire to a @entity20 man watched him slowly die			0

his body is charred , but he is clearly still alive and moves slowly as a crowd surrounds him			0
several policeman can be seen looking on			0
a voice can be heard calling for water , to which another voice replies ' no water for him			0
' the clip surfaced as @entity175 published a report which concluded @entity5 authorities and members of @entity180 groups have committed crimes against humanity in a campaign of ethnic cleansing @entity54			1
the sectarian violence , the worst seen in @entity187 's fledgling democracy since last year 's conflict , was sparked after an argument between a @entity20 gold shop owner and his customers in the city of @entity57			2
agony : a horrifying moment in the clip is when a man , almost certainly a @entity20 , is seen rolling around on the ground having been set alight slow death : his body is charred , but he is still alive and moves helplessly as a crowd surrounds him and several policeman watch slow death : buddhists with sticks are the unleashing of ethnic hatred , suppressed during 49 years of military rule that ended in march 2011 , is challenging the reformist government of one of @entity187 's most ethnically diverse countries			2
jailed dissidents have been released , a free election held and censorship lifted in @entity5 's historic democratic transition			1
but the government has faced mounting criticism over its failure to stop the bloodshed between @entity10 and @entity54			0
