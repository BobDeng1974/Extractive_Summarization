up in the expensive seats , @entity0 looked down on another fruitless appeal for a @entity4 penalty and blew out his cheeks			1
this was one of those days at @entity8			0
for all their improvement in the second half of the season , @entity4 are still capable of throwing in a performance like this from time to time			1
there are still days when the cogs in the machine do n’t run smoothly , days when the absence of any kind of @entity19 hurts @entity4 and hurts them badly			1
they defended brilliantly , ran hard and stuck to a game plan devised by manager @entity23 to deny @entity4 the space between the defensive and midfield lines that their playmakers love to work in			1
@entity20 defended stubbornly to stop players such as @entity29 ( centre ) from having an impact for @entity4 @entity0 ( left ) was in the stands watching the game at @entity8 , as was former team - mate and @entity36 columnist @entity35 @entity0 did not play for @entity4 due to injury but the supporters are desperate to get to @entity39 in his final season at the club @entity42 ( right ) landed awkwardly and play was halted for eight minutes as he was treated by medical staff @entity42 lies on the ground after contesting a header with the @entity20 forward @entity47 @entity49 ( centre ) stands over @entity42 before calling for medical assistance for his @entity4 team - mate @entity42 was moving his arms as he was carried off on a stretcher in the 11th minute of @entity4 's @entity56 tie a week earlier here at @entity8 , @entity58 champions @entity57 found it impossible to plug those gaps			1
as a result , @entity4 ’s @entity62 @entity29 won that game almost on his own			1
here , though , @entity20 found the key and , as a result , @entity4 ran out of ideas			1
the visitors ’ formation squeezed the life out of @entity4 while their two central defenders @entity72 and @entity73 cleaned up everything that @entity76 ’ team did manage to throw in to the penalty area			1
on the break , @entity20 were dangerous too			2
without their much - discussed centre forward @entity82 – who was injured - the @entity80 side relied heavily on the imposing figure of @entity47 and he worried @entity4 ’s back three all afternoon but especially in the first half			1
perhaps @entity4 were unsettled by a nasty injury to their own defender @entity42 in the very first minute			1
a header from @entity72 ( second left ) brought a fine save from @entity89 at the start of the second half @entity89 ( centre ) made a superb save to tip the header from @entity95 away at the beginning of the second half @entity97 ( left ) hit the back of the net in the first half but his strike was ruled out for offside @entity97 ( right ) replaced the injured @entity42 and also hit the post with a header in the second half @entity103 came on in the second half for @entity4 but was unable to find a way through the @entity20 defence @entity4 : @entity89 6.5 , @entity107 6 , @entity42 6 ( @entity108 , 6 ) , @entity109 6 , @entity110 6.5 ( @entity103 59 , 6 ) , @entity111 6.5 , can 6 , @entity112 5 , @entity113 5.5 , @entity114 6.5 , @entity29 5.5 subs not used : @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120			1
bookings : can @entity20 : @entity122 7 , @entity123 6.5 , @entity72 7 , @entity73 7.5 , @entity124 6.5 , @entity125 , @entity126 6 ( @entity127 68 , 6 ) , @entity128 7.5 , @entity129 6.5 , @entity130 6 , @entity47 8 subs not used : @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137			2
bookings : @entity125 att : 43,820 * ratings by @entity140 at @entity8 the @entity141 fell awkwardly in a challenge with @entity47 and was treated for what looked like a neck injury for eight minutes			0
happily he was okay by half - time and able to watch the rest of the game			0
no doubt he found it as frustrating as the majority crammed inside @entity8			0
they were the better team			0
but by their own improving standards , their football lacked crispness and rhythm and as such they found it difficult to ever gather momentum			0
@entity20 were actually the first to show after @entity42 ’s injury and @entity47 was the game ’s most influential player for 25 minutes			1
the manner in which he forced @entity4 goalkeeper @entity89 in to a mistake under a high ball seemed portentous while the dummy he sold @entity113 to give @entity130 a sight of goal on the overlap soon after was terrific			1
sadly for @entity20 , @entity130 ’s shot flew high and wide			2
there was the occasional moment of cohesion from the home team but far fewer than we would have expected			0
@entity4 may have had a penalty in the 19th minute when @entity73 appeared to bundle over the largely ineffectual @entity112 in the penalty area			2
did the defender ’s toe just touch the ball first ? perhaps			0
that apart , there were a couple of long shots from @entity29			0
after his recent success from distance , nobody could blame the @entity62 for having a go			0
on this occasion , his range was set too high , however			0
@entity42 ’s replacement toured did have the ball in the net in the 34th minute after a free - kick dropped invitingly to him six yards out but he was a yard offside			1
then , during the eight extra minutes added for @entity42 ’s injury , @entity110 and @entity114 brought saves from @entity122			2
it was notable that they were the first two the @entity20 goalkeeper had been asked to make all half			1
@entity4 attacker @entity112 ( right ) was denied a penalty after tumbling from a challenge by @entity73 of @entity20 can ( left ) battles for the ball with @entity125 of @entity20 as the first half ended goalless at @entity8 can ( right ) , who was playing in midfield on sunday for @entity4 , challenges for the ball with @entity128 of @entity20 @entity4 playmaker @entity29 ( left ) tries to escape the attention of @entity20 's @entity128 but the @entity209 struggled going forward @entity114 ( centre ) is tackled by @entity72 as @entity4 's attack toiled against a stubborn @entity20 back four @entity110 ( left ) of @entity4 chases down @entity20 's @entity126 during the @entity56 quarter - final at @entity8 @entity20 's @entity213 ( right ) turns away from @entity4 captain @entity111 in the game at @entity8 @entity113 leaps over the challenge from @entity123 ( left ) of @entity20 but the ball rolls out of play after the interval , @entity4 did build pressure			1
as @entity20 ’s energy levels dropped , they found it harder to break			2
still , though , @entity20 had the best chance as @entity72 ’s header from a corner in the 48th minute was brilliantly touched over by @entity89			1
beyond that fright , @entity4 ’s football was undeniably quicker , neater and indeed more progressive			2
still , though , they found it hard to penetrate the wall of blue			0
indeed , all that @entity76 ’ team really had to show for their efforts as the game reached the last 20 minutes was a shot by @entity114 that was blocked by @entity72 and a follow up from @entity29 that must have landed somewhere in the environs of @entity235			0
@entity20 manager @entity23 shouts instructions to his players during the @entity56 game against @entity4 @entity4 manager @entity76 will be frustrated by his team 's lacklustre performance on a frustrating afternoon amid all this , though , there was a more convincing penalty shout , @entity114 going down as @entity73 sought to impede his run with an outstretched arm			1
it was the type of penalty appeal that generally tends to be ignored			0
the use of the arm by defenders is not in the rules			0
in the last ten minutes there were two more saves for @entity122 to make , one from substitute @entity103 and one from @entity111			0
in all , @entity4 had 21 shots			2
that , however , suggests @entity4 were better than they actually were			2
there were some bright spots , such as the performance of @entity49 at the base of the midfield			0
the @entity263 has a superb passing range and it will be a surprise if he does n’t develop in to a very good player			0
on this occasion , however , the glory was all @entity20 ’s			2
they may have to be slightly more expansive when it comes to the replay in april but they deserved this draw and will relish 90 minutes against @entity4 at @entity273			1
by then @entity0 will expect to be back in the thick of it			0
if he wants to get to @entity39 for his birthday @entity276 , he is going to have to do his bit .			0

@entity4 's @entity42 was carried off on a stretcher early on after landing awkwardly
@entity97 had a goal ruled out for offside in the first half and hit the post with a header in the second
@entity20 ' defence held strong and they will now host @entity4 in a replay at @entity273
