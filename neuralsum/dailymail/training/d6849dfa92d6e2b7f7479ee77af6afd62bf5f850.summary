by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 expects @entity3 to be challenging for the @entity5 title this season			1
the sense of optimism around @entity3 is growing as the 2014/15 top - flight campaign draws ever nearer , with new manager @entity10 having come in and so far seen his team emerge victorious from all five of their pre-season friendlies			1
the @entity13 are looking to bounce back after the debacle of 2013/14 , when they struggled under @entity16 and finished seventh in the table - a year on from being crowned champions in sir @entity21 ’s last season in charge			1
the 39 - year - old said : ' the new manager is in charge now , we are on an unbeaten run and now we are looking to make a good start to the season with the first five games we have got ( @entity36 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 )			1
' everyone expects @entity3 to contend for the title			1
' we finished as low as we have done last season , but when the season starts again , everyone will expect			1
i am a fan , and i will expect us to be challenging again			1
' @entity2 , a @entity3 player from 1992 to 2004 , knows the strong desire within the club to respond after disappointing periods and has no doubt there will be that kind of feeling in the dressing room at the moment			1
great presence : @entity2 says @entity10 has an aura about him huge desire and success : @entity2 says there are similarities between sir @entity21 and @entity10 ' it ( that desire ) is immense , ' @entity2 said			1
' in days gone by it has sometimes been when @entity3 are at their strongest - when they have had setbacks			1
' we were always told in no uncertain terms that you had to step up to the plate , otherwise you were not going to be at the club for very much longer			2
' i ’m sure the new man in charge will say the same thing to the players			2
hopefully the players will react , and i ’m sure they will			2
' @entity2 worked with @entity3 ’s youth set - up last term and asked about his current role under @entity89 he said : ' it is a bit of a wider remit now - i ’m looking over all age groups			1
but that needs to be finalised in the next few weeks			2
' back in action : @entity2 played for a class of ' @entity97 team against @entity98 the famous class of ' 92 team : @entity2 stands alongside @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 and @entity105 then asked for his impressions so far of the @entity107 , @entity2 said : ' @entity108			2
he is obviously a very in - control man			2
' he has an aura about him - when he walks in the building , you know who the boss is , and i think that is very important			1
' we had that with sir @entity21 for all those years and i think we have that now with @entity89			1
he walks into the building and he commands your respect			2
' all the players look up to him as the leader and that is how it should be			0
from afar , when i ’ve looked at him it looks like he takes no messing about and if anyone does n’t toe the line , i ’m sure they will be out of the team			0
' @entity2 was speaking at the @entity132 , where he , @entity101 , @entity105 , and @entity103 and @entity104 rolled back the years as they lined up together in a ‘ class of 92 and friends ’ xi for a friendly against @entity98 , the non-league outfit they bought between them this year			0
confident : @entity139 enjoyed a brilliant pre-season in the @entity141 and is excited for the new campaign the quintet went on to enjoy trophy - laden careers with @entity3 after all graduating from the club ’s academy in the early 1990s - something @entity2 thinks is unlikely to be replicated			1
' it is possible - there are a lot of great young players out there , ' the @entity150 international said			0
' but we just need to give them a chance			0
we had a manager in charge and a club that believed in that , but it is harder now with the immediacy of it all			0
' owners that come in do n’t necessarily know a lot about football - they just know a lot about business , unfortunately			0
but that ’s the way football is			0
people do n’t have the foresight to wait and see			0
' to be fair , managers come in now and why should they go four or five nights a week looking at academies when nine times out of 10 they are not going to be there to see the rewards ? ' i think good lads , top players , will still come through			0
but whether you will get five or six through together is something i doubt			0
' we played together since we were 12 , 13			0
to prepare lads to come through takes a lot of patience and a good owner to say to a manager ‘ we are going to give you time and stand by you ’			0
' unfortunately , for whatever reason , it does n’t happen now			0
