when the largest home in @entity3 went to auction last year , its sellers must have thought they had a real zinger on their hands			2
but fast forward 12 months , and @entity6 , in picturesque @entity7 , is still on the market			1
perhaps given the state of the sluggish @entity11 economy , an $ 8.75million ( Â£ 5.4m ) price tag is too much for even the wealthiest prospective buyers			0
for that money , they 'd get a mansion with three grand guest suites , 10 bathrooms , and a massive 5,000sq ft master suite			1
larger than the average @entity11 home , the master suite alone has two dressing rooms , two bathrooms , a sitting room and a fitness room - which can even be reached by elevator			1
but clearly its new name has not been enough to entice a new owner			0
' we had at least half a dozen offers			0
' we had some who were fairly interested and basically they indicated that it was really a full - time residence , it was not really a vacation type property and they were not prepared to live year - round in @entity7 , ' realtor @entity53 told @entity54			1
the 35,000 sq ft @entity32 - inspired estate , built by @entity34 philanthropist @entity33 in 1993 , is one of the largest single - family residences in the state			1
@entity6 is currently owned by realty group @entity57 , based in @entity34 - who have managed the property for six years the house even has its own big screen movie theater complete with concessions stand and ticket booth the house also features sitting rooms , an entire wing dedicated to a pool and spa including tropical plants , and a floor made of @entity72 quarry stone the house was sold to an unnamed couple from @entity75 in 2005 , but the pair became ill before they could move in and never lived there @entity33 built the house to mimic 19th century homes on the @entity81			1

@entity6 is currently owned by realty group @entity57 , based in @entity34 - who have managed the property for six years			1
the new deal includes the beach house , guest house and 80 acres of land			0
@entity53 said that the owners will pay the first five years of real estate tax , and will also donate 4 per cent of the sale proceeds to charities such as the @entity97 , @entity98 , the @entity99 , and another charity chosen by the buyer			1
given the downturn in the real estate market since that 2005 sale , real estate agents expect buyers with enough cash on hand could make a killing on the sale			2
last year , @entity113 real estate @entity111 described the house as a mixture of classic style and modern amenities with a breathtaking view of @entity119			2
the luxury property has lain vacant for almost a decade last year , @entity113 real estate @entity111 described the house as a mixture of classic style and modern amenities with a breathtaking view of @entity119 @entity125 built the house to mimic 19th century homes on the @entity81 ' spiral staircase , leaded glass stained window , ' @entity111 said			1
' an entrance from the balcony above into the owner 's bedroom			0
' the house also features a two - storey library designed in the style of the @entity42 mansion , sitting rooms , and an entire wing dedicated to a pool and spa including tropical plants , a floor made of @entity72 quarry stone , and several waterfalls including one connecting to a 14 - person whirlpool			1
the indoor pool also includes its own fully - functional kitchen , guest locker room , steam shower and bathroom			2
the house even has its own big screen movie theater complete with concessions stand and ticket booth			1
realtors told @entity54 that the problems in the housing market are not limited to shifting huge mansions			0
less expensive holiday homes , such as another valued at around $ 1.5million has also proved hard to sell			0
' this is probably an average upscale vacation home in @entity7			2
it 's been for sale this time for about seven months , ' said @entity166 , from @entity167			0
' right now i think there are only about 40 to 45 for sale			0
so that 's a fairly long market time			0
' @entity166 , who specialises in homes valued at more than $ 1 million , said just seven such properties have been sold annually in the county			0
@entity6 has been rented out for private events but is classed as residential , so can not be converted into a hotel .			2

@entity6 in @entity7 has 3 grand guest suites , 5,000 sq ft master suite and two - storey library
