a mosquito 's antenna , a falling sycamore seed - and incredible internal shots of the human body : these images show the wonders of science from around the world and beyond			1
selected for the @entity11 ’s latest exhibition , they highlight the beauty of scientific research			1
among the pictures on display at the @entity16 2013 - which showcases the work of 54 scientists - are dividing cancer cells , a bat embryo , gallstones , the cell wall of a coffee bean and , from slightly further afield , the @entity25			1
this photo of a crying baby forms part of the @entity29 , organised by the @entity11 incredible views of the human body are now possible through sophisticated scientific instruments such as fibre optics , endoscopes , microscopes , telescopes , stereo microscopes and ophthalmoscopes the show features works by 54 scientists from around the world here , thermal imaging has been used on a subject to dazzling effect selected for the society 's latest exhibition , which is touring the @entity49 and rest of @entity51 , the images highlight the incredible beauty of scientific research photography skills play a crucial role in medicine , forensic science , engineering , archaeology , oceanography , natural history and many more areas			1
dr @entity63 , director general of the @entity11 , said : ' the society was founded in 1853 to promote the art and science of photography and we ’ve been doing just that ever since			1
‘ we held the first @entity16 exhibition in 2011 and it went down extremely well			1
' the application of photography to science is almost as old as photography itself			2
this alien - looking configuration is actually dividing cancer cells ( by @entity77 ) this remarkable image shows the interior cell walls of a coffee bean a close - up of gallstones , caused when cholesterol level in our bile is too high , and excess cholesterol is turned into stones this captivating image of the @entity90 nebula reveals an area of our galaxy as a bustling neighbourhood of recently formed stars , hot gas and dark dust			1
the nebula is visible to the unaided eye as a small fuzzy patch in the constellation of @entity90 @entity100 , 2012 , by @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103			2
this , believe it or not , is the base of a mosquito 's antenna			2
the image is from a scanning electron micrograph , and has been digitally coloured the skeleton of a chameleon embryo , by @entity113 as early as 1872 , @entity114 , a @entity49 - born photographer , used photography to study and analyse motion in horses			1
since then , by using invisible radiation , new techniques and methods of photography have arisen			0
this has happened , for example , through sophisticated scientific instruments such as fibre optics , endoscopes , microscopes , telescopes , stereo microscopes and ophthalmoscopes			0
‘ gone are the days when we were restricted to 1000 @entity135 emulsion sensitivity , ’ said dr @entity130 , exhibition co-ordinator			1
among the startling images on show is this mouse foetus extreme close - up view of the head of a @entity141 by @entity142			1
many species build their nests on human habitation , while not normally aggressive paper wasps will defend their nests vigorously			1
this image is part of a series investigating our often - overlooked housemates triple exposure image showing a seed falling from a @entity156 tree by @entity157 , @entity158			1
this image was created in three exposures ; the first with flash to show the leaves and seeds , the next a half - second exposure showing the spiralling fall and the last a flash exposure to freeze the seed at the bottom of its descent ‘ today , dslr cameras with full frame sensors have the ability to process images that reduce noise in low light conditions			1
' we have ccd sensors , sensitive to much higher @entity135 sensitivities which can yield usable images			0
‘ we used to say that , “ if you can see it , it can be photographed ” and now we say , “ even if you can not see it , we most likely can photograph it ”			0
’ the @entity16 exhibition is currently on a tour of the @entity49 before heading to @entity51			1
@entity188 and @entity189 penguins on an ice floe near @entity191 in the @entity192 by @entity193			0
the photographer observed them pushing each other off the floe and swimming in the water as if playing a game of tag @entity201 found on front porch doormat by @entity142			0
there are over 40,000 species of true weevils in the family @entity208 , beetle - like creatures typified by a long snout and clubbed antennae the left image shows the collision of two water droplets beneath a bursting soap bubble by @entity215 , @entity216			2
the image was captured using a @entity219 slr camera and a xenon flash unit with an exposure time of 9 microseconds			0
the right image unique fishbone pattern is created by two colliding steams of liquids by @entity226			0
the pattern is currently the focus of scientists studying the strange world of fluid dynamics coloured scanning electron micrograph of a @entity233 holding a gear from a micromechanical device by @entity236			0
the gear is about 0.1mm wide human cortical neurons with interconnecting dendrites , 4,200x by @entity239			2
cortical neurons make up the brain 's cortex which in part makes up the cerebral cortex , responsible for memory , attention , perceptual awareness , thought , language , and consciousness 3d reconstruction of a glass model of a jellyfish , imaged using x-rays in a @entity256 scanner by @entity257 , @entity258			0
the artificial colours used here are based on the density of the glass			0
this incredible model was sculpted in glass in the mid- 19th century by @entity265 and @entity266			0
the techniques used by this father and son team are not fully understood , it is hoped that this study will help reveal some of their secrets a porcelain crab feeding inside the safety of its host @entity277 coral branches by @entity279 from @entity280			2
it is lit by the bright green fluorescence of the coral			0
these are normally very shy creatures and are difficult to photograph light micrograph of a mouse embryo , approximately 10.5 days post-fertilisation by @entity286			2
the specimen was stained with a fluorescent marker that highlights the presence of precursor cells to nerve tissue then chemically treated to make it optically transparent			0

wonders on show at @entity29 *include* coffee bean cell walls and mouse foetus
the exhibition , by the @entity11 , is on @entity49 tour before heading to @entity51
cutting - edge technology provides *amazing* views from inside the human body
