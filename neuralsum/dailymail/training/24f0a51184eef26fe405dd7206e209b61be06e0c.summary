pregnancy is something which is traditionally only applicable to women , however new statistics reveal it may be becoming more prevalent among males			2
in the past year 54 @entity7 men have given birth according to @entity9 - who recently allowed people to elect their own gender on documents , rather than being forced to record the sex they were born			1
since @entity18 became the first man to give birth in 2007 after he kept his female reproductive organs when he transitioned to male , others such as @entity17 transgender man @entity16 have also given birth			1
pictured here is @entity18 , the first male ever to have a baby and it seems this occurrence has extended to @entity27			0
in the 2013 - 2014 financial year 22 men in @entity27 gave birth to their own children , while in @entity32 16 men had babies			1
plus seven men in @entity35 , six in @entity36 , two in @entity37 and one in @entity39 all became new dads in an unconventional way			2
the men were mostly aged 24 - 36 with 32 of the babies being born from males in that age group			0
one man aged 55 - 64 also had a child			0
no male births were recorded in the @entity49 or the @entity50 , according to the @entity9 statistics			2
it is likely that the men giving birth were born female but identify as male and kept their female reproductive organs after transitioning			1
this was the case with @entity18 who gave birth to his first child in 2007 , and has since has two more children			2
mr @entity60 , a transgender male , was born a female and as he kept his reproductive organs he was able to give birth to three children the @entity7 @entity64 confirmed the statistics to @entity66 , saying they were informed of such cases around the country			1
' the department is aware of cases of persons identifying themselves as male having pregnancy related treatment which can be claimed under @entity9			0
previously these items could not be paid to male patients , ' a health department spokeswoman told the @entity78 in addition to men giving birth , they have also been accessing abortions , although the exact figures on this are unclear as they are tallied under the same code as a dilatation and curettage ( @entity89 )			1
transgender @entity35 spokeswoman @entity90 told @entity92 the statistics do not come as a surprise and supported the decision by @entity9 to allow people to record their own gender			1
' people need to be their true self in relationship to gender identity and gender expression ... i 'm not really surprised			0
' a few years ago transgender couple @entity103 and @entity104 had a child , with @entity16 - who was born @entity107 - giving birth as for whether she believes this will be something we see more often in the future , ms @entity90 predicted that we will see the number of transgender males giving birth increase			1
' i think it will ... people are saying well we 've got a right for life , so yes it will increase			0
she added that while she understands that while people 's relationships with their bodies and gender identities run deep and may differ , people have the right to simply be themselves			0
' we 're not just two groups of three and a half billion each , we are all different people , ' ms @entity90 said .			0

54 @entity7 men have given birth in the past year
@entity9 statistics show that 22 men were from @entity27 and 16 from @entity32
men also accessed abortions according to the figures
it is likely those who gave birth were transgender men who kept their female reproductive organs after transitioning
transgender @entity35 said they think the number of males giving birth with increase in coming years
