by @entity0 published : 09:21 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 09:34 est , 3 june 2013 for years council gardeners working on a smart suburban road have carefully trimmed back the grass verges during the summer months			1
but this year the authority have sent their workers out and told them to trim only one side of the street - and ignore the other because it is ' not their job any more '			1
in a baffling move designed to save money , two local authorities in @entity10 , @entity11 , now have to send two separate gardeners to look after the same road			1
council cutbacks : @entity17 , 65 , said that while the authority has cut the grass on one side of this street in @entity10 , @entity11 , the other has been allowed to grow to 15 inches - because ' another authority is responsible ' edge of a council boundary : while @entity26 look after the far side of the road , the near side is classed as a ' public highway ' so it is @entity32 's job to cut it so while homeowners on one side have seen the unkempt grass grow to 15 inches , on the other it has been mowed four times this year already and looks ‘ like a billiards table ’			1
@entity26 insist it is no longer their responsibility to keep the whole of @entity41 looking smart - and blamed the decision on ' government cutbacks '			1
they trim the verges 14 times a year between march and october			1
anger : @entity17 , 65 , and his wife @entity48 , 66 , who returned from six months away to find the grass overgrown in comparison , @entity32 which has been handed the job of cutting the other side of the road , does the job only five times between april and november			1
it was thought that taking the job off @entity26 would help save taxpayers ' money			0
@entity59 and @entity60 returned to @entity61 after six months away to find a 75 - square metre patch of grass outside their home was completely overgrown			1
@entity66 - of - two @entity67 , 65 , said the situation has left their neighbourhood looking like an eyesore			2
' both sides were mowed in january but the changes must have occurred at the start of the financial year , ' he said			2
' it has n’t been cut since january now and has grown to 15 inches			1
the other side has probably been cut four times since january			1
' it ’s a small job that would n’t take much effort , so i do n’t know why they ca n’t just talk to each other and arrange @entity26 to do this extra patch			0
' we all understand there ’s austerity measures but to send two teams to do the same job on different days is ridiculous			0
' it is a laughable situation			0
my grandson walked into it the other day and i nearly lost him			0
' it feels like it ’s not on the council ’s list of things to do			0
we just do n’t feel like we ’re getting the service we pay for			0
' one side looks like a billiard table and the other is a right eyesore			0
' cut price service : the move to have two authority 's cutting two sides of the same road was made to ' save money ' overgrown : @entity32 insist they will be cutting the 15 - inch grass imminently a spokesman for @entity26 said : ' both sides used of @entity41 used to be our responsibility but when the @entity117 cutbacks came in 2010 , we stopped			1
' one side is classed as a green space - which is our responsibility - but the other is a public highway , which is @entity32 's			2
so technically its not on our land			0
' @entity122 , @entity32 ’s district highways manager for @entity26 , said there had been a delay in cutting their grass areas			0
he said : ' the county council is responsible for cutting more than 5,000kilometres of grass verge right across the county			0
' there was a delay starting this year due to bad weather which , unfortunately , also helps the grass to grow that bit quicker			2
' we are just coming to the end of the first cut so all areas , including @entity41 , should have been cut by now			0
' both councils said the grass is cut purely for safety , rather than aesthetic , reasons .			2

@entity144 have only mowed one side of the road in @entity10 , @entity11
they insist another authority has to do the other side
grass has grown to 15 inches - while on the other side of the road it has been cut four times this year already
