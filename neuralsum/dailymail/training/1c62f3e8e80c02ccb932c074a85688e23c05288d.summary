here , @entity7 's @entity0 offers his verdict on all of @entity10 's men			1
the @entity4 began the series with a narrow 20 - 15 victory in @entity13 , before an incredibly narrow 28 - 27 victory in the second @entity15 secured overall victory			1
and a 36 - 13 romp in the final game ensured that @entity2 would return to the @entity19 empty handed			1
@entity4 have now won 17 tests in a row , equalling a record set by themselves in the 1960s , and equalled by @entity25 between 1997 - 98			1
underwhelming : @entity2 were on the end of a 3 - 0 series defeat at the hands of @entity4 test starters @entity30 – after late arrival , try - scoring cameo in @entity33 led to starting chance in third test but could n’t capitalise			1
5.5 light and shade : a good display off the bench in second test could n't be capitalised upon in the third @entity41 – a dip from the staggering heights of his season - of - a - lifetime			1
errors crept in but still a spirited effort			0
6.5 dip : @entity41 could not live up to his superb early season form @entity50 – @entity51 and fell in a fortnight			0
superb personal outing in @entity13 gave way to a comedown in @entity56			0
6 indifferent : @entity50 was superb in the opening @entity15 , but disappointing in the final encounter @entity59 – brought in for second test , he was exposed defensively and lost starting place but rallied in finale			0
5.5 exposed : @entity59 struggled in defence but rallied well @entity64 – calamitous end to a fine campaign with training - ground accident , off - key comeback and an injury relapse			2
5 relapse : @entity64 suffered a calamitous injury in training that curtailed his series @entity74 – another who veered from triumph to disaster			2
a quick - step revelation before his horrors in @entity56			2

6 mixed : @entity83 missed the start of the series then had it curtailed by injury @entity92 – delighted to make the trip after injury but it fell flat			2
was off the pace in front of his family in @entity56			0
5 @entity99 : @entity92 was off the pace during the tour @entity102 – could n’t do much more to prove his worth			2
titanic effort at @entity105 and prominent in midweek win			2
7.5 standout : @entity102 could n't have done much more to prove his worth @entity107 – fell below previous standards			0
struggled with re-starts and looked tired at the end of long season			0
5.5 not his best : @entity107 fell below previous standards during the tour @entity115 – one of the victims of the fixture clash , forced to play catch - up			1
committed as ever but not dominant			0
6.5 congested : @entity115 had to play catchup after being a victim of the fixture clash @entity122 – overall his stock rose on the tour			2
scored scrum points in @entity13 and kept carrying and tackling tirelessly			0
7 rising stock : @entity122 impressed on the tour overall @entity128 – his moment of truth came at @entity105			2
after hit - and - miss display , he was dropped as coaches lost patience			2
5 disappointing : failed in his big opportunity at @entity105 @entity136 – started with a thunderous performance in the series opener			0
couldn ’ t repeat it but finished in credit			0
7 thunder : @entity136 started superbly but tailed off slightly in the next couple of games @entity144 – the stand - out performer in the entire squad			1
provided leadership input to go with his varied individual feats			0
8.5 man of the series : @entity144 was @entity2 's top performer in @entity4 @entity152 – magnificent in @entity13 as he eclipsed @entity154 but concerns about his breakdown work linger			1
7 indifferent : @entity152 was brilliant in @entity13 but tailed off like so many others @entity158 – @entity160 centre pounded the @entity4 before switch to flank and back to midfield			1
7 @entity164 : @entity158 pounded the @entity4 at times @entity166 – a grim episode for him			1
recovered from injury but then dropped as a scapegoat for @entity33 defeat			0
5 scapegoat : it was a grim series on the whole for @entity166 @entity174 – attitude was questioned by coaches early on then his most notable intervention led to costly yellow card			0
5.5 indiscipline : @entity174 's attitude came into question in @entity4 @entity182 – @entity184 effort from the hooker to return to full fitness and perform valiantly to raise his future prospects			1
7.5 @entity188 : it was a valiant display overall from @entity182 @entity190 – aside from fumbles in first test , @entity192 prop was among top forwards			1
strong work in tight and loose			0
8 leading from the front : @entity190 put in a superb series of displays for @entity2 @entity200 – as fervently committed as ever , even amid meltdown in @entity56			1
typical grit , graft and defensive defiance			0
7 committed : grit , graft and defiance from @entity200 @entity208 – scored two tries and last test may have been his coming - of - age occasion as he cut loose in second half			0
8 cutting loose : @entity208 managed two tries for @entity2 during the series @entity215 – was n’t particularly convincing in opener but turned his tour around with sparky display on final weekend			1
7 turn around : unconvincing start from @entity215 but he turned it around well test replacements @entity222 5 , @entity223 6.5 , @entity224 7.5 , @entity225 5 , @entity226 6 , @entity227 6 , @entity228 6.5 , @entity229 7 , @entity230 5 .			0
