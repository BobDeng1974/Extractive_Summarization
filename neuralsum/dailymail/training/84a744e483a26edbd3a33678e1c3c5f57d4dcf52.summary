by @entity0 and @entity1 marine life in the @entity3 could be under threat if new plans to transfer coal between ships in the middle of the ocean go ahead			1
this process has never been undertaken in @entity11 , and environmentalists have concerns that ships could crash into each other spewing coal into the world heritage - listed waters			1
they also say activity could disturb sensitive eco-systems and upset fisheries and turtles			0
@entity22 is the company which has applied to the federal @entity24 , and are aiming to get permission to send barges into the @entity27			1
they have lodged an application to construct a new barging and trans - shipping terminal at the location , equipped to handle up to 15 million tonnes of coal per year			0
instead of docking at a land - based port , ships would anchor offshore , above a sand bed , as cranes on a barge transfers coal from a smaller ship to a larger vessel			1
however @entity36 has admitted in its @entity55 plan could affect endangered migratory species such as the irrawaddy and indo pacific humpback dolphins			2
' although it is likely to be minimal , the project could impact on listed , threatened and migratory species , ' it said in its application			0
@entity63 have applied to expand @entity64 , south of @entity39 , so they can unload coal offshore the @entity66 have great concerns for the transfer of coal between ships , as any accident could pose a threat to sea life			1
' we could see boats crash into each other			0
we could see coal spewing into reef waters , ' campaigner @entity77 told @entity1 , adding light pollution and noise could affect spawning fisheries and turtles			0
' we do n't think a marine park is a place where you should be dredging , dumping or transferring coal from ship to ship			2
' @entity63 , however , argues its trans - shipping proposal minimised the need for sea bed dredging , which occurs when a land - based port is expanded			1
' executive director of @entity22 @entity95 , who is heading up the @entity97 project agreed the proposal presented some risks , but said they would use @entity102 technology			2
environmentalists are against the move saying any accidents could seriously upset sensitive eco-systems in the reef ' there 's always the potential for accidents and we have to make sure that ... our engineering comes up with a suitable risk profile where we have safeguards , ' he told @entity1			0
he added this type of trans - shipping was carried out in @entity118 and the @entity119			0
@entity63 has put forward a controversial proposal like this before - the @entity122 near @entity123 in central @entity40			1
the @entity122 is also an expansion of a current port , @entity126 , claiming to export more than 25 million tonnes of coal per year			0

@entity63 have applied to expand port in @entity38 , located *911* *kilometres* north of @entity133
they want to transfer coal between ships offshore in the @entity27
environmentalists are concerned that any accident could pose a threat to endangered marine life
@entity22 has put forward a *similarly* controversial plan at @entity145 , near @entity123 in central @entity40
