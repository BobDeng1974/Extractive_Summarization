@entity1 columnist @entity0 was at @entity2 to see his former side collect some silverware in the traditional curtain raiser to the @entity7 season			1
here is what he learned from @entity11 's 3 - 0 victory over @entity12 in the @entity13 ... 1			1
@entity14 or @entity15 ? @entity16 showed nothing at @entity2 to suggest he should start ahead of @entity14 next season			1
@entity31 may feel @entity14 will operate better when he is under severe pressure			2
things will become much clearer when @entity25 names his team for @entity36 next week			0
@entity11 's new £ 30million man did n't stop running @entity38 showed brilliant intelligence coming of the right wing and he will terrorise defenders with his pace this year			1
he was hugely impressive , but it was n't any more than i expected			0
he is a guy who is n't frightened of hard work			0
speed demon : @entity38 non-stop running will cause defenders a problem this season 3			1
city different team without @entity52 @entity52 is one of the world 's best defenders , he 'll go down as one of the best in @entity7 history , so it 's no surprise @entity12 missed on sunday			1
they are n't the same without him			0
they seriously missed his pace on the break yesterday			0
' i 'm glad you were n't playing ! ' : @entity12 struggle in the absence of captain @entity52 ( @entity68 ) 4			1
@entity69 makes case for the defence as a centre - back i thought it was another huge step in the right direction for the youngster @entity75			2
i was particularly impressed with his tenacity and intelligence			0
when he made interceptions he did n't just look to clear it , he would look to pick someone out			0
he 's made an excellent start to his @entity11 career			2
first impressions count : @entity75 was impressive on his competitive debut for the @entity87 5			1
@entity11 need a holding midfielder @entity89 and @entity90 will fill @entity11 's midfield lynchpin role next season , but the club should start looking at a long term successor in that position			2
chambers could be the answer in that role in the long term , but at the moment they need him at the back			0
they need a little bit more pace through the middle of the park			0

@entity11 defeated @entity12 3 - 0 in the @entity13 at @entity2
@entity27 , @entity117 and @entity30 scored for the @entity87
@entity119 failed to impress in place of @entity14 as @entity12 's *goalkeeper*
new boy @entity38 looks set to terrorise @entity7 defenders
@entity25 's side do not look the same without @entity52
@entity75 was impressive and could eventually be used in midfield
