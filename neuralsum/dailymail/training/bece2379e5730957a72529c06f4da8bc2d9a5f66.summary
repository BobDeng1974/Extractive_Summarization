@entity1 striker @entity0 scored one of the most audacious goals ever seen on the final day of the @entity6 @entity5 season - but was it the ultimate act of showboating or disrespectful gamesmanship ? the 21 - year - old did not little to improve relationships with rival club @entity12 in what should have been a meaningless mid-table clash before everyone turned their attention to holidays			1
@entity1 were already leading 2 - 1 when @entity0 steals the ball from the out of position @entity12 goalkeeper			2
best foot forward ? @entity0 scored an outrageous goal that was either entertaining or insulting step 1 : @entity0 steals the ball from a well out of position @entity12 goalkeeper step 2 : the @entity29 international races through clear on the unguarded goal step 3 : just as he gets there @entity34 stops the ball on the goal line and stoops to his hands and knees step 4 : to complete his party trick , @entity34 nudges the ball over the line just before a @entity12 defender arrives but , instead of just passing the ball into an unguarded net , @entity34 races towards the goalline before stopping the ball , stooping to his hands and knees and nudging it over to complete a 3 - 1 victory			1
even the late , great @entity53 , who was something of a showman himself , admitted thinking against using the trick while playing for @entity57			0
while the @entity6 under 21 international will have gained cult status from his own supporters , it 's unlikely that any of his opponents will be sending him a postcard during the off - season .			0

@entity0 scored on his hands and knees in @entity1 3 - 1 win over rivals @entity12
@entity6 striker stopped the ball on the goalline before nudging it over with his head
the act could be considered either entertaining or insulting *...*
