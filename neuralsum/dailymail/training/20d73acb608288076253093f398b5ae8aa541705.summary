but now it 's claimed @entity9 wants to become a mother again by starting another family with her new lover			2
since her release from prison for kidnapping her nine - year - old daughter @entity16 , the 36 - year - old has been dating the man			1
freedom : @entity9 enjoys the sunshine as she goes on a shopping trip , wearing a white shirt , black vest , green trousers , black leggings he began writing to @entity27 when she was behind bars and now , according to relatives , she is in love and wants to have his children			1
the family member told the @entity33 sunday : ' @entity34 began exchanging letters with a man while she was in prison			1
released : @entity27 ' figure is a little more slender after four years on prison food he was in prison too and he was released first and began visiting her			1
' she says he is her boyfriend and they are planning to have kids together			2
they have met up several times since she was released at @entity47			0
' @entity27 was jailed in 2008 for the horrifying crime of kidnapping her own daughter and doping her up with temazepam and travel sickness pills			1
she was freed from prison last month after serving just half of her eight year sentence			2
however , @entity27 could be facing jail again after a probe into alleged benefit fraud was reopened			1
investigators are examining more than £ 100,000 she is believed to have pocketed between 2004 and 2009			0
@entity27 was entitled to much of it - including thousands of pounds in child benefit			1
but @entity66 officials are understood to be analysing the rest of her claims to make sure she really was entitled to it			0
a source told @entity73 : ' if she 's found guilty she faces another stretch inside			0
' but anyone who knows her thinks it 's only a matter of time till she 's back behind bars			0
it 's where she belongs			0
' @entity27 is said to have claimed up to £ 400 a week in benefits while living with supermarket fishmonger @entity9 who earned £ 16,000 a year			1
she told officials at the time she got no child support from the five men who fathered her children and was therefore due the cash			0
face in the crowd : @entity27 , centre in black vest , who served just four years for kidnapping her own daughter , mingled with more shoppers pictures following her release showed @entity27 strolling freely through the streets near her bail hostel in southern @entity105 with a completely new look			1
clad in a cream coat and blue jeans , the ex-convict looked calm as she returned to her bail hostel following a trip out with another woman			0
@entity27 was given a full makeover including a new hairstyle before her release to prevent her being recognised in the street , and now lives under an assumed name			1

@entity9 wearing a ' @entity122 , would you like to join us ? ' vest at her bail hostel mother - of - seven @entity27 pictured strolling with friends near her bail hostel @entity27 , wearing black leggins under a pair of trousers , was hardly kitted out for the hot weather as she strolls with a friend from the bail hostel in southern @entity105 the crime , carried out with 44 - year - old @entity136 , saw her launch tearful pleas for help finding the nine - year - old , who she held captive for 24 days			1
the mother - of - seven was freed from @entity143 in @entity144 last month and taken to a secret location believed to be within 30 miles of her former home in @entity148 , @entity149			2
unlike @entity150 , who was jailed after the @entity153 murders of @entity150 and @entity150 , she has not been given a new identity including a new national insurance number and passport			0
such a move would have cost the taxpayer £ 250,000 and required @entity27 to keep her real identity a secret			1
it is not known if @entity27 requested a new identity			1
but officials were so concerned that she would jeopardise it and her safety by failing to keep it a secret that they ruled it out			0
in love : with a trendy , short hair cut , @entity9 is trying her best to conceal her identity from the @entity3 public but has found love with a new man @entity27 will use the assumed name when she comes into contact with people in a social setting , but when she is dealing with officialdom she will use her real name and rely on client and patient confidentiality to protect her identity			1
she will be supported in this by probation officers			0
@entity27 , whose children are now in care , will remain on licence for the rest of her sentence			2
during that time she must observe strict rules or face being returned to jail			2
@entity196 : the 36 - year - old no longer sports the long , greasy red hair which made her so recognisable to millions of disgusted people up and down the country			0
her daughter @entity16 is pictured left empty : the former home of @entity9 in @entity148 , @entity149			0

@entity27 began writing to her new man while she was in prison
