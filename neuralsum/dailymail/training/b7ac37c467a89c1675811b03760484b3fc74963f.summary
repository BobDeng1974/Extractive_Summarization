clash : another protester is arrested by @entity14 officers in the march peaceful protest : a police officer gives orders to occupy @entity5 protesters during the march , though he seems not to listen civil disobedience : a protester , who said she was not acting as part of the overall occupy movement but as an individual , lights an @entity99 flag on fire let it burn : another person assisted the woman light the flag but the movement 's colourful cast of theatrical demonstrators struggled through last winter to sustain the momentum that first drew attention to its patchwork of economic grievances - including corporate malfeasance on @entity5 , crippling student debt and aggressive bank foreclosures on @entity99 homes			1
on sunday , organizers will provide live music , including a @entity145 concert featuring @entity146 , guitarist for the rock band @entity147			0
