mr @entity101 has warned that any move for the 26 - year - old striker had to be for the right reasons			1
' bearing in mind what happened with his release and then of course the furore that we had at @entity38 we feel that any club wishing to sign him needs to be 100 per cent committed to signing him for proper and legitimate football reasons , ' mr @entity101 added			2
@entity0 ' attempts to return have so far been fruitless , with clubs turning down the chance to employ him any move to sign @entity0 is likely to lead to public outcry , but mr @entity101 was keen to avoid a similar situation to the one that engulfed @entity38 after they made their offer to the player			1
' i do n't want to create a replica - type situation that we had at @entity220 ( @entity38 ) because i 'm a little bit concerned that we need press conference and that will invite , of course , many antagonists , ' he said			0

' we 've made it clear in our statements that we feel he 's been unable to say much because of the appeals process , but he has served his time and the job of society is to look to rehabilitate			0
any move abroad for @entity0 is unlikely to materialise given @entity238 's tough regime in managing sex offenders			2
a @entity163 spokesman said : ' we are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders , to stop them re-offending and to protect victims			0
' probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings - this effectively rules out working abroad			0
' the offenders will also be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones , non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes			0
' @entity4 declined to comment			0

sex offender @entity0 , 25 , was released from prison last october , halfway through his five year sentence for raping a 19 year - old woman in a hotel room in may 2011			1
already a number of clubs , such as @entity38 and @entity272 , who showed interest in signing the shamed striker later changed their mind - after huge backlashes			2
today @entity278 , of the @entity279 , said : ' we are appalled by any football club which signs an unrepentant convicted rapist			1
' @entity0 has shown no remorse for his crime and has actually used his profile to persistently claim his ' innocence ' in the media and to re-traumatise his own and many other victims			0
' we would ask the owners and the manager of any club thinking of signing @entity0 - please consider seriously the message you will send to the survivors of sexual violence who are among your fans , and to your whole local community , as well as to football fans as a whole			1
' if you sign him you will give him a new platform to continue denying the crime he committed			0
' please reconsider and show that your club has zero tolerance of sexual violence and of attitudes which trivialise or condone it			0
' ms @entity278 said they always feared this january a club would ignore public opinion and try to sign the rapist			2
she added : ' as we are in the transfer window it feels this matter will not go away			0
it is time for the @entity317 to step up and make its views known			0
fan associations should urgently do the same			0
' the government estimates that around 85,000 women are raped in @entity322 and @entity77 every year			2
rape is not a marginal issue			0
' all of us know survivors of rape			0
the police and courts can not sanction and deter it alone			0
