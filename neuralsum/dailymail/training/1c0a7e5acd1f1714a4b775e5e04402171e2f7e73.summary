on january 25 1995 , @entity0 was involved in an incident that would see him spend three - and - a - half hours in jail , miss eight months of football and do 120 hours of community service			1
the then - @entity7 forward was sent off against @entity8 at @entity9 and , on his way to the dressing room , he then kung - fu kicked a home supporter			1
here , key witnesses to the incident reveal their version of events			1
@entity0 launches a a kung - fu kick at @entity8 supporter @entity17 in 1995 the @entity19 forward flies into the crowd , hitting target @entity17 and the woman next to him @entity23 ( @entity7 player that day ) i could n’t believe my eyes			1
for anyone who saw it , the only rational response was ‘ wow ’			2
we all ran over to find out what happened , or more specifically why — what had caused him to do it			2
had he been punched or something ? the game carried on , @entity39 scored for us , then @entity40 got the equaliser			2
it ended 1 - 1			2
that second half you had 21 footballers carrying on in a state of surprise			2
i ca n’t recall the manager saying anything about it in the dressing room			2
if he did have a tizzy then our heads were too frazzled to take it in			2
@entity58 ( @entity59 for @entity60 ) @entity0 is dismissed ! can there be a place in the game for a man with such extravagant talent and such wicked temperament ? a man who has now … oh my goodness me ! he just kicked … he ’s punched a fan ! @entity0 has jumped in and scissor - kung - fu - kicked a fan ! i have never seen as disgraceful an incident as that in all my years in football			1
@entity0 should be thrown out of the game for that sort of incident			1
@entity23 , left , played up front with @entity0 at @entity7 in the late 1990s @entity0 reacted angrily to abuse from a @entity8 fan after he was sent off during the match at @entity9 @entity81 ( the referee ) people say @entity8 had been winding @entity0 up but that ’s not true			1
my recollection is he was only challenged twice in the first half			2
then , early in the second half , there was @entity0 ’s kick at @entity90			1
@entity91 launched one of his long kicks			0
there were only two players in the @entity8 half — @entity90 and @entity0			1
they came together and @entity90 turned more quickly			0
@entity0 kicked out at @entity90 so i dismissed him			1
i did not see him kick the fan because i was dealing with @entity23 who was suggesting i might not have made the right decision ! after the game one of my assistants told me what had happened but it was only when i saw it — at 2am on @entity106 — that my jaw dropped to the floor			1
i just thought ‘ wow ’			0
@entity109 ( @entity7 ’s ex-head of security , speaking to the @entity112 ) i followed him down the stairs with the wardens and when we stopped he looked at me and sort of shrugged his shoulders			1
we went into the cell and were sitting down together , and the police warden came in and said : ‘ listen , do n’t take any food from here			0
i ’ll pop down the road and get some @entity124 ’s and chips ’			0
i gave him [ @entity0 ] my phone so he could phone his wife			1
then we ’re eating away and having a chat about it , and he said : ‘ i just ca n’t be bothered with all this , i ’ll just serve my sentence ’			0
i said : ‘ no way			0
let ’s see what the outcome is ’			0
but he was relaxed , signed autographs and took a couple of photos while he was there			0
he was so cool about it			0
stewards attempt to restrain the forward after his assault on the @entity8 supporter the @entity19 forward was found guilty of assault at @entity148 as a result of the incident @entity40 ( @entity8 player that day ) a big altercation was going on as @entity0 was going off then we heard this strange noise from the crowd and saw stewards running over			1
we carried on with the game and i remember my goal but as soon as we got back to the dressing room i realised it was not going to get the headlines ! it hit me how serious it was when we left our dressing room			0
the @entity7 players were lined up in the tunnel , dressed in club blazers , but nobody was speaking			1
they were very subdued and had been told not to make any comment , not to us , the press , nobody			0
@entity170 ( @entity7 director and legal advisor at the time ) @entity0 took the situation very seriously			1
he attended every meeting and was always on time			0
i recall vividly the moment in @entity148 ’ court , when the magistrate , much to the surprise of everyone , imposed an immediate prison sentence of 14 days			0
suddenly @entity0 was taken to the cells			2
we lodged an immediate application for bail , which was turned down			0
so i then had to run up to the @entity186 and successfully got bail and leave to appeal			0
but @entity0 had to spend three - and - a - half hours in a cell , and it ’s fair to say he was n’t too happy when we got him out			1
we had called an emergency meeting at @entity7 and agreed to ban him for the rest of the season ; four months , an unprecedented 21 games			1
but the @entity194 extended it til the end of september , which we thought was harsh			0
i thought we should have a press conference and he said he would only attend if he could say a few words			0
that ’s when he delivered the infamous trawler and seagulls line			0
i thought it would be the best way to draw a line under the whole episode			0
i remember him asking me for the @entity207 word for the boats that collect the fish , and the @entity207 for the birds that fly over the sea			2
then he wrote the line on a piece of paper			0
as one legal periodical put it , @entity0 had committed the most high - profile common assault in the history of the @entity207 legal system			1
he was banned from @entity207 football by the @entity194 for eight months and ordered to carry out community service from left to right : @entity0 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 and @entity225 in the 1996 @entity227 final			1

@entity0 kung - fu kicked a @entity8 fan 20 years *ago*
he was banned from @entity207 football for eight months
the @entity7 legend was also made to do community service
