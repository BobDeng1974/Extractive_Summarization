by @entity0 published : 06:01 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 07:58 est , 16 january 2014 @entity3 drugs cheat @entity4 has broken his silence over his season - long ban to declare that the break could actually benefit his career			1
the slugger , who is suing @entity10 and the player 's union over the suspension , refused to address his legal battle but said he was looking forward to returning to the game fresh next year			1
he said : ' i think that in the year 2014 , the league could have done me a favour because i 've played 20 years without a timeout			1
' i think 2014 will be a year to rest , mentally , physically prepare myself for the future and begin a new chapter of my life			1
' breaking his silence : @entity3 third baseman @entity4 told a press conference in @entity26 that his season - long drugs ban could benefit his career by giving him a chance to rest mentally and physically @entity3 captain @entity29 says he has been left ' saddened ' by @entity4 's ban			1
the shortstop , who has played with @entity4 for ten years , said the affair has been ' kind of messy '			1
he said there had been ' communication ' with his disgraced teammate , adding : ' he 's human			1
i 'm sure it 's a rough situation			2
' ' other than that , it is what it is , ' @entity29 told the @entity43			1
he was speaking to media at the @entity45 during the launch party for his celebrity golf tournament			2
@entity4 spoke in @entity48 at a press conference in @entity50 to announce the opening of a gym he is affiliated with , but did not take questions			1
video of his appearance was aired on @entity56 early this morning			2
the third baseman thanked his well - wishers who included not just his @entity3 teammates , but also ' players from other teams , retired players , @entity63 players ' as well as ' lots of good people , owners of other teams			1
' he said he intended to see out the three years he will have left on his contract from next year and wants ' to finish his career in @entity71 '			1
he plans to take part in spring training which he is entitled to do			2
his ban , which was reduced from 211 games last weekend , is the longest ever in baseball for the use of performance - enhancing drugs and will cost @entity4 $ 25 million in salary			1
he filed a lawsuit monday in federal court against both @entity10 and the player ’s union seeking to overturn his banishing for the 2014 season			1
the lawsuit also made public the entire 33 - page decision made by arbitrator @entity87 after a series of contentious hearings between @entity4 , the league , the player ’s union and @entity93			2
a man of his word : @entity4 vowed saturday in a statement to take the fight to federal court ‘ we recognize the standard to overturn an arbitration is a high one , ’ attorney @entity99 , part of @entity4 ’s legal team , told @entity56			2
' but we think this proceeding was so flawed from beginning to end '			2
the suit comes only one day after @entity109 aired a shocking interview during which mr @entity93 admitted to personally injected steroids into mr @entity4 , directing his doping regimen and even drawing blood from him in a @entity115 nightclub bathroom stall			2
‘ given the intense public interest in this matter and commissioner @entity123 's disclosures last night on 60 minutes , it 's difficult to imagine that any portion of this proceeding should be under seal , ’ @entity117 district judge @entity116 said during the hearing			2
‘ mr @entity4 is directed to file his unredacted complaint with the attached exhibits , ’ he added			0
the third baseman ’s legal team had originally brought a redacted lawsuit ‘ in an abundance of caution , ’ according to mr @entity99 , who said mr @entity4 and his lawyers were afraid of running afoul of the collective bargaining agreement between the players union and the league			1
out in the open : the lawsuit comes only one day after @entity93 spilled the beans to ' @entity109 ' ‘ we 're perfectly content to unredact and file the entire complaint , ’ mr @entity99 continued			0
@entity143 lawyer @entity142 unsuccessfully argued in favour of the redacted complaint , saying ‘ the [ union ] believes that those matters should stay confidential , that is , the decision and the underlying proceedings			0
’ ‘ we 're thrilled , ’ said mr @entity99			0
‘ we want the entire record to be public			0
we want everyone to be able to see exactly what @entity93 said			0
’ @entity4 legal team frontman @entity153 had to participate in the hearing via telephone , @entity56 noted , but mr @entity99 picked up right where his co-defense council left off last night on ’ 60 minutes			0
’ ‘ the introduction of triple , quadruple hearsay , inauthentic documents , documents that were stolen not once , but twice that were presented out of order , that were presented in incomplete fashion that @entity93 could n't even identify - all of this was relied on without question by ( @entity87 ) , ’ mr @entity99 griped			0
mr @entity4 ’s team was denied access to the actual @entity167			0
‘ @entity10 had two experts that were allowed to examine those @entity167 with unfettered access			0
we did n't get one , ’ mr @entity99 continued			0
no refuting : @entity10 coo @entity172 told ' @entity109 ' that @entity4 never tried to defend himself against mr @entity93 's allegations during the arbitration hearings that resulted in the 162 - game ban the lawyer then bashed mlb commissioner @entity123 for talking to ’ 60 minutes ’ but not testifying during the hearing , which famously caused mr @entity4 to storm out in a fit			1
‘ one thing that was very interesting was whenever we had discussions on ways to resolve this , @entity10 was adamant that they wanted 162 games , ’ said mr @entity99			0
‘ @entity186 and behold , where did this decision come out ? it is all in the complaint			0
’ @entity10 chief operating officer @entity172 was quick to point out that the 14 - time all - star never testified during the arbitration hearings in his own defense , he never tried to refute mr @entity93 ’s claims			1
the ballplayer claimed in a statement issued shortly after the suspension was announced that the arbitration process was unfair and that the deck was stacked against him			0
running out of options : @entity4 has no where else to turn should this lawsuit not go his way ' this is one man 's decision , that was not put before a fair and impartial jury , does not involve me having failed a single drug test , ' the former mvp said			0
the league will almost certainly call him to the stand during the upcoming civil trial – and he can be asked about anything , including steroids , human growth hormone and whatever else he may have ingested			0
the only way mr @entity4 is likely to get his suspension overturned is by testifying under oath or submitting a sworn document he did n’t take the drugs he is accused of taking , a @entity43 legal analyst said			0
should he go that route and be found guilty of taking the banned substances , the next chapter in this saga would be a criminal trial			1
the player fans deride as @entity231 will finally have his day in court either way , but the truth may set him free or see him locked up .			0

third baseman says the break will allow him to rest mentally and physically
' i 've played 20 years without a timeout . 2014 will be new chapter in may life '
@entity244 spoke for first time since ban , which will cost him $ *25m* in salary
