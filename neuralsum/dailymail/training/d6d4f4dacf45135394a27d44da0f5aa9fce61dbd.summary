it is not often that opportunities have been squandered during this blissful summer for @entity3 but one certainly slipped through his fingers in the first round of the @entity6 on thursday			1
at five under par with three holes to play , the @entity8 and @entity7 was two shots clear and threatening to make one of his ominous opening day statements in this penultimate event in the race for the $ 10 million bonus for the @entity18			2
bogeys at his 16th and 17th holes , however , rather changed the complexion of his round and turned the spectacular into the merely very good			1
the frustrated look he wore at the end was that of a man feeling short - changed			2
good start ... but @entity3 will be kicking himself for a poor finish in the opening round he is still the joint leader after a 67 , mind , albeit in a tie now with @entity35 @entity34 and @entity36			1
an enormous crowd turned up to watch @entity3 fly the ball prodigious distances through the thin @entity41 air			1
for 15 holes it was his work around the greens that must have left his fellow competitors with the all - too familiar feeling they lacked the necessary firepower			2
three birdies in a row to start his back nine were all due to his short game prowess but , for once , he struggled thereafter to keep the ball on the fairways			2
‘ it is still a really good start but there were definitely a couple of sloppy bogeys at the end , ’ said @entity3			1
‘ it ’s tricky out there			0
you ’re hitting irons and fairway woods off the tees but they ’re still running into the rough , while the greens are getting quicker all the time			0
you ’re having to land the ball ten yards before where you were landing it in practice			0
’ flying out the traps : @entity3 made light work of the first 15 holes falling away : @entity3 's bogeys at the 16th and 17th meant he was forced to share top spot on the leaderboard @entity3 warmed up in spectacular style , clearing the netting at the far end of the driving range – just the 370 yards away - and landing his ball on the adjoining @entity81			1
here at storied @entity83 , jaws dropped at the iconic 1960 @entity8 when @entity84 thrashed at his ball in trademark style to drive the 318 yard par four opening hole			0
now here was @entity3 , creating another legend with drives that were literally finishing out of sight			1
on the course itself , the driver remained largely sheathed thanks to the thick rough that placed a high premium on hitting the fairways but there were still a couple of near 400 yard boomers			0
the altitude helps , of course , with the ball thought to fly 5 - 8 per cent further for most golfers			0
when you hit it as high as @entity3 , though , it is more like 15 per cent			1
‘ i also hit a 3 - wood 370 yards in practice , so that was pretty good , ’ said the 25 year old			0
‘ the ball seems to be going forever			0
’ @entity3 ’s driving has become such a buzz topic that @entity35 @entity113 was desperate to accompany him in a practice round to see for himself what all the fuss was about			1
on the tee : @entity118 hits a drive on the first hole during the first round of the @entity6 in contention : @entity123 hits his tee shot on the ninth hole on his way to a one - under - par round of 69 his verdict ? ‘ i played with @entity129 during his all - conquering summer in 2000 and what i saw today was comparable with what i saw playing with @entity129 except @entity3 has more power , ’ he said			1
‘ @entity3 is a lot longer than @entity129 ever was			1
i have never seen anybody play with that kind of power and control			2
’ with the @entity139 looming every closer , it ’s inevitable these final two @entity141 events will be analysed to see who ’s in form and who is not			0
half the @entity146 team are among the 70 players competing here – that number will be whittled down to just 30 for the finale next week , the @entity150 – and there were a number of encouraging performances			0
in addition to @entity3 , @entity155 and @entity156 shot 68s , while @entity158 was two under playing the final hole when the horn sounded for a weather suspension			1
he will finish up on friday			0
@entity118 was a bit like @entity3 in feeling he had let a great round slip away			1
he started with three straight birdies but had to settle for a one under par 69			0
@entity168 , in his first round since becoming a parent for the first time , was the only @entity146 to finish over par. he was three over with his 18th hole to finish on friday morning			0
@entity34 was by miles the best of the 12 @entity35 @entity139 players on view , with none of the others managing to finish in the top 20 on day one			2
of most concern for captain @entity177 on his 65th birthday would have been the lamentable performance of @entity180 , who shot 77 .			0

@entity182 *falters* late on after flying out of the traps
@entity3 was five under with three to play , only to bogey the 16th and 17th
he shares the leaderboard with @entity34 and @entity36
