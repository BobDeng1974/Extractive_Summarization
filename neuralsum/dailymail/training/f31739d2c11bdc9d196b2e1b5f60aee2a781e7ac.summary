mr @entity16 , 45 , claims he had been living in exile in @entity26 , @entity27 , before being detained with his wife @entity28 while en route to @entity29 , where they were trying to seek asylum			1
he alleges they were sent back to @entity6 - which was under the rule of @entity34 - and imprisoned and tortured			2
the civil action , which is against mr @entity2 personally , seeks to examine his exact role in the rendition and claim damages from him for the trauma involved			2
mr @entity16 's lawyers , @entity41 , said they sent the mp a letter yesterday asking him to produce a number of documents			1
they include papers mentioned in a @entity47 article which alleged that mr @entity2 signed off the rendition , as well as his diaries , memoirs and notes from march 2004 onwards			1
@entity52 , who claims to have shared the same fate as fellow @entity6 and @entity34 opponent mr @entity16 , is also taking legal action against mr @entity2			1
mr @entity16 , a key military figure in the uprising that toppled @entity34 last year , is already suing the @entity57 and @entity58			1

the @entity47 reported at the weekend that mr @entity2 had been confronted about the his alleged role by @entity58			0
allegations : @entity16 suing the former foreign secretary @entity70 , a partner at @entity41 , said : ' we have said all along that liability must follow the chain of command			1
' these latest revelations bring us closer to that goal			0
if the former foreign secretary does not now own up to his role in this extraordinary affair , he will need to face the prospect of trying to defend his position in court			1
' @entity83 , legal director of @entity84 , said : ' at last it seems we know who signed off @entity29 ’s involvement in rendition to torture			2

they deserve an apology for the appalling way they were treated			0
' she went on : ' it is now also totally unreasonable for the government ‘ neither to confirm nor deny ’ its role in the @entity102 and @entity16 renditions			2
' yet this is their official position			0
what is left to be covered up , besides the reasons these terrible mistakes were made ? the case needs to be fully examined - in the open			0
' the @entity29 public deserve a full explanation of how their government sank so low as to become complicit in the rendition of children and pregnant women			0
' @entity116 said it was ' looking closely ' at the legal action brought against mr @entity2 but declined to comment on the details of the case			0
a spokeswoman said : ' the government ’s position on torture is well - known			0
we stand firmly against it and any cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment			0
we do not condone that and we do not ask others to do it on our behalf			0
' we take the allegations very seriously			0
what is important now is to ensure a fair trial and civil proceedings when people accuse the government of mistreatment and seek compensation			0
that is one of the issues we are looking at as part of the @entity144			0

the move follows reports suggesting the former foreign secretary signed documents that allowed @entity16 to be sent back to his homeland in 2004
