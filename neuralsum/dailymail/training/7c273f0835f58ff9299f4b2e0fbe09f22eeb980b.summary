by @entity0 published : 19:10 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 07:03 est , 26 september 2013 more access : lord @entity2 told @entity3 that @entity4 had better access to @entity6 than him a @entity8 minister has complained that he has less access to @entity10 than @entity4 ’s executives			1
@entity2 of @entity13 ’s admission is the latest demonstration of the internet firm ’s political clout			0
it emerged in a report from the @entity19 , which lambasted @entity4 for its ‘ flimsy excuses ’ for not tackling online piracy			1
it also slammed the company for directing users to websites where they can illegally download material			2
the committee said it has proved exceedingly difficult to introduce tougher sanctions for internet pirates , in the face of reluctance from web giants such as @entity4			0
‘ we have also heard complaints from across the creative spectrum about the perceived power and influence of @entity4 in the government ’s inner , policy - making sanctum , ’ the report said			1
it went on to quote @entity42 , the intellectual property minister , who had given evidence to the committee			1
‘ the minister hardly dispelled this impression : “ @entity4 is one of several search engines , ” he told us			2
“ i am very aware of their power , put it that way			0
i am also very aware , i think , that they have access , for whatever reason , to higher levels than me in no. 10 , i understand			2
” ’ the @entity45 revealed last year that @entity8 ministers had held meetings with @entity4 an average of once a month since the @entity49			2
@entity62 has also been criticised for surrounding himself with @entity4 cronies			0
@entity64 , the company ’s global head of communications , worked with mr @entity62 at @entity68 and the prime minister is godfather to her youngest son			2
she is married to @entity71 , mr @entity62 ’s former policy guru			0
@entity8 mp @entity72 , the @entity73 committee chairman , said it could not be ‘ beyond the wit ’ of @entity4 engineers to block websites which offered illegal downloads of music , film and video games			1
illegal downloads cost the creative industries an estimated £ 400million a year			1
creative industries worth more than £ 36billion to @entity85 would be ‘ put at risk ’ if creators could not rely on intellectual property rights being ‘ robustly enforced ’ , mr @entity72 added			1
the @entity45 's story from may 19 , 2012 , which highlighted the internet giant 's influence on the government 's policy ‘ we are unimpressed by @entity4 ’s failure to stop directing consumers to illegal , copyright - infringing material on the flimsy excuse that some of the sites may also host some legal content			1
‘ the continuing promotion of illegal content through search engines is simply unacceptable , and efforts to stop it have so far been derisory			1
insider : @entity4 's head of communications @entity109 , pictured , worked with @entity62 at @entity68 ‘ there is no reason why they can not demote and ultimately remove sites hosting large amounts of illegal material from search engine @entity116 and others already work with international law enforcement to block for example child porn from search results , and it has provided no coherent , responsible reason why it ca n’t do the same for illegal , pirated content			1
copyright infringement is a serious crime that threatens our economic future			0
’ the committee called for those guilty of online piracy to face up to ten years in prison , a five-fold increase on the two - year limit they currently face			1
a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ we removed more than 20million links to pirated content from our search results in the last month alone			0
‘ but search is not the problem – according to @entity142 just 8 per cent of infringers in the @entity85 use @entity4 to find unlicensed films and 13 per cent to find unlicensed music			0
‘ @entity4 works harder than anyone to help the film and music industry protect their content online			0
’ the company aims to remove pirated content from the web in less than six hours			0
in total , it received 57million notices from copyright owners and agents last year , demanding that it remove pirated content			0
the internet giant also changed its computer code last year to recognise sites which had legal action taken against them for copyright infringement .			0
