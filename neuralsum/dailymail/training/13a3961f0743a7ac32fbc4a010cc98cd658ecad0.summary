@entity0 are preparing to offer @entity2 's man of the moment @entity4 a new deal as part of a contract renewal drive			1
the @entity0 want to tie @entity4 , as well as @entity8 and @entity9 , down to fresh contracts			1
@entity4 and @entity9 's deals expire at the end of next season and the south - coast club are understandably keen to secure the @entity2 duo 's long - term futures			1
the @entity30 defender impressed in both matches , leading to calls for the 23 - year - old to be installed as @entity34 's first - choice right back			0
@entity0 have long viewed @entity4 as their long - term right back ; their decision to sell @entity37 to @entity38 in the summer was testament to that			2
@entity4 's first two @entity2 caps have come within a week against @entity28 and @entity20 the former @entity42 right back is now being touted as a possible first choice @entity2 player formal talks over a fresh terms are yet to begin , but the @entity0 intend to show their commitment to @entity4 by initiating discussions in the coming weeks			1
@entity4 is likely to attract interest from rival clubs next summer , with @entity52 understood to be monitoring his progress			0
but @entity0 want to avoid any uncertainty over his future by signing the @entity2 international to an improved deal			0
likewise , @entity0 want @entity9 to sign a new five - year contract as they seek to keep him from @entity60 's clutches in january			2
@entity61 has made @entity9 - who has n't played since april due to a serious knee injury - a priority signing once the transfer window reopens			0
@entity8 is among high - flying @entity0 stars the club is keen to make a fixture @entity9 , who has n't played since april , is top of @entity61 's list at @entity60 but the @entity0 want the striker to snub his former boss and commit to a new deal			1
extending @entity8 's contract is not as urgent for @entity0 given his current deal does not expire until the summer of 2017			0
nevertheless , the @entity76 international will be offered an improved deal on his existing Â£ 30,000 - per - week terms			0
@entity38 and @entity60 have both shown a firm interest in the 25 - year - old , but @entity0 hope they can persuade @entity8 to commit his future to the club he joined in 2008 .			2

@entity4 is set to receive a new contract off from @entity0
