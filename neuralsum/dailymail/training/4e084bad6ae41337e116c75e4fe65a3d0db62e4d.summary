by contrast @entity17 and @entity18 are backed by almost twice as many voters , amid increasing signs that growth is gaining momentum			2
issues : when asked which party has the best policies on the economy , 38 per cent said the conservatives compared to just 20 per cent who said @entity5 the surprise surge in support for the @entity32 comes after two successive quarters of growth , leading mr @entity18 to boast that the economy has ‘ turned a corner ’			1

living costs : labour leader @entity11 used a q&a session in @entity53 to claim he was on the side of ordinary people , but only 23 per cent of people think they would be better off if he became prime minister the figures show the @entity60 is starting to benefit from an improved economy with @entity63 spending on items such as unemployment benefit falling and tax receipts starting to perk up			1
mr @entity18 has been under constant fire from the @entity5 for pursuing an austerity plan it claimed was failing to cut the deficit and deliver growth			1
speaking at an open - air q&a session in @entity53 on the eve of his party conference today , mr @entity11 again tried to accuse the @entity32 of only acting in the interests of the wealthy			1
the @entity5 leader said : ‘ the way a country succeeds is not just with a few at the top it 's with what i call the forgotten wealth creators			0
‘ the people who put in the hours , who do the work , who do two jobs , who do the shifts			0
‘ they are the people we should be supporting in this country			0
that 's how we tackle the cost of living crisis , that 's how we have an economy that works for working people again in our country			0
’ but according to the @entity38 poll just 23 per cent of people think they would be better off under a @entity5 government , with 22 per cent saying a @entity3 government			1
just over half ( 52 per cent ) said it would make no difference either way			0

@entity109 , head of @entity110 at @entity38 said : ‘ the economy has been the number one issue facing the country for five straight years now , and after six consecutive months of rising economic optimism perhaps it is no surprise to see the @entity3 take a clear lead here			0
‘ meanwhile , the image of the parties going into conference season shows the challenges they face : the @entity3 are seen as the most fit to govern and with the best team of leaders , while @entity5 has the lead on understanding @entity125 ’s problems and looking after the interests of the man and woman on the street			2
‘ the @entity130 have lost the mantle of the outsider party to @entity133			0
’ clash : chancellor @entity18 is growing increasingly optimistic about the pace of the recovery but shadow chancellor @entity137 has accused the government of being complacent with just 18 months until the 2015 general election campaign gets underway , @entity5 is under prerssure to set out policies which will persuade doubtful voters they are fit to govern			1
today mr @entity11 promised to increase the minimum wage , offer more childcare support for parents and reverse £ 470million worth of housing benefit changes he described as the ‘ bedroom tax ’			0
