if you ’ve ever posted a tweet full of typos , or realised you ’ve included the wrong person in a conversation , you may soon be able to save face by editing the post			2
according to news site the desk , @entity7 is working on a feature that would let users modify previously posted tweets without having to delete them and repost			1
the editing feature would only be available on tweets for a short period of time , and the reports claim tweets can only be changed once			1
@entity7 is said to be working on a feature that would let users make ' small changes ' to tweets , such as correcting typos , but the feature would only be enabled for a short period of time			1
an algorithm could also prevent people from being able to change the ' overall intention ' of the tweet @entity30 unveiled an editing feature in september that lets users change posts after they ’ve been sent			1
security experts criticised the plans because other @entity30 users who had interacted with the post would not be notified			0
however , a history of edits is available and that particular post is marked as ' edited			0
' this would be to avoid users spamming each other or removing information from a tweet that could be used in legal proceedings , for example			0
similarly , if a tweet with a link to a news story is getting a lot of retweets , this limited time feature will prevent a brand changing this link to a promotion or product later on			2
it is likely users will only be able to make ‘ small changes ’ to the tweet , such as correcting a single typo , or changing one or two words			2
they will not be able to change the ‘ overall intention ’ of a tweet , and it is thought @entity7 is working on an algorithm that could determine if this intention has changed			1
any changes made to a tweet would then appear in posts that are retweeted , using the @entity7 button , but not in tweets where another user has quoted the original			1
sources claim the feature is still in development , but is likely to be ready in ' weeks , or months at the most			0
' the feature could be especially useful for people who tweet from mobile phones or tablets due to mistakes made because of autocorrect tools and smaller touchscreen keyboards sources , quoted only as ‘ @entity7 employees ’ , claim this algorithm is still in development but is likely to be ready in ‘ weeks , or months at the most			2
