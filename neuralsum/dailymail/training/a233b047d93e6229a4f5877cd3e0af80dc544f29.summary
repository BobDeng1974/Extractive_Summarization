a family shamed by a trendy restaurant on social media for walking out without paying their bill have now settled their tab			1
@entity7 posted a @entity9 picture on its company @entity11 page showing a mystery family apparently leaving its new restaurant in @entity14 , @entity15			1
next to the photograph , a staff member wrote : ' to this family that walked out tonight without paying their bill , we are sure this was just a ' mistake ' and you completely forgot , so out of the goodness of your heart please call the restaurant tomorrow to pay the bill			1
' @entity7 posted this @entity9 picture on its company @entity11 page showing a mystery family walking out of its new restaurant in @entity14 , @entity15			1
in the caption , staff claimed the group did not pay their bill the post , which appeared on @entity11 this week , triggered a flood of protests from other customers who were furious at the family being ' shamed ' in public over the apparent bill blunder			1
however , @entity7 insisted today that the post was ' made with the intention of encouraging the guest in question to come back and pay for their mistake to rectify the loss for the business			2
' a spokesman said the family had now settled the tab for their meal – which is thought to have cost in the region of £ 80			0
the spokesman said : ' it was n't done with the purpose of naming and shaming anyone as we are well aware that these things happen			0
' as a company we take our social media policy seriously - it was posted at a local level and has now been removed			0
' the table in question has now come forward and paid their bill so thank you to those who provided us with any information			2
' we have taken the decision to donate the money from the bill payment to the charity @entity76			0
' the @entity9 picture posted by @entity7 on @entity11 showed a man dressed in a smart grey suit jacket and jeans , a woman in a dress with a thick overcoat and two other women dressed in black trousers , scarves and coats			1
they appeared to be leaving the city centre restaurant			0
more than 600 people commented on the image that was available for the restaurant 's 3,200 fans , before the food chain deleted it			2
the restaurant chain accused the family of walking out of its @entity7 branch in @entity15 ( above ) it sparked fury among diners , with some blasting the restaurant - which offers either burger or lobster with sides - for the ' very public shaming ' of the unnamed family			1
@entity108 , a regular customer at the trendy chain said : ' people make mistakes like this all the time , especially if there is a few of them			1
' i 've had to go back and pay after leaving and realising			0
not a very professional approach by this food chain if these customers have left in error ! ' i do n't like the way in which you operate and puts me off ever coming into your establishment again ! disgusting ! ' fellow customer @entity123 said : ' genuinely a disgrace posting this on a social media platform			1
' if this is a mistake and they come back and pay how are you going to 're - inform ' everyone who saw this that they made a genuine error			0
terrific social faux par here			0
' @entity135 added : ' disgraceful action by the restaurant , they have given this family little time to make amends before trying to publicly shame them on social media			1
' totally unprofessional management of this situation , which makes you wonder if the front and back of house are also mismanaged			0
' however , while several people appeared to be against the restaurant 's actions , some customers supported the post			0
@entity154 said : ' people moaning about the photo annoys me ! if they paid there want be a problem ! ! 100 people prob went to that restaurant and did n't have their photo put on @entity11 cause they paid for their meal ! ! ! ( sic )			1
' @entity165 said : ' you did 100 per cent the right thing by posting the photos , ' while @entity169 simply added : ' you did right			0
' the @entity171 restaurant has only been open for a month and , in line with other @entity174 restaurants in the country , has just three items on the menu - a burger , lobster or a lobster roll with fries and salad			0
everything at the restaurant costs £ 20 so it 's likely the family 's bill came to around £ 80 , or slightly more with drinks			2
it is likely the family of four spent about £ 80 at the @entity171 restaurant because everything at the trendy chain - which only offers burger or lobster - costs £ 20			1
@entity7 also has branches in @entity197 the first @entity7 opened in @entity198 , @entity197 , in december 2011 and it was followed by a second , larger restaurant in @entity200 in july the following year			2
it has since opened several other branches in the capital in @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and on the fifth floor of @entity207 in @entity208			0
the @entity15 restaurant , the most recent to be opened by the chain , is the first @entity212 branch to be unveiled outside of @entity197			1
the only other branch of @entity7 , which is operated by @entity215 steakhouse group @entity214 , is the @entity217 flagship in @entity218 - which came after its success in @entity212			2
the trendy chain boasts on its website as offering ' some of the best lobster around for just £ 20 ' , and aims to appeal to customers by having no menu			2
instead of perusing a list of options for their meal , diners simply choose whether they wish to order burger , lobster or a lobster roll .			0

trendy chain said family of four left @entity15 restaurant without settling bill
*facebook* users hit out at chain for posting @entity9 photo and accusing them
