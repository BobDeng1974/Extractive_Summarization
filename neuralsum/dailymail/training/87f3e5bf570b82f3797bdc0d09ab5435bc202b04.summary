final results looks like old paper theatres for quirky cut out artist @entity4 a picture really is worth a thousand words			1
sentences and paragraphs are of little interest to the 37 - year - old who instead cuts around different images from 150 - year - old @entity12 books and carefully pieces them together to create a brand new 3d art form			1
the @entity16 - based artist , originally from @entity17 in @entity18 , has created vivid , detailed collages that feature everything from old soldiers standing to attention to giant pink flamingos			1
intricate : from @entity26 adventure books to a history of the 19th century artist @entity24 has turned old books into an art form works are created using only the pictures that are already in the volumes and the end result is a hollowed out book with a layered composition similar to the @entity12 paper theatres that were hugely popular at that time			1
the books are sealed around the cut so they can no longer be opened , but are designed to be either hung on the wall or can stand by themselves as an art object			1
' most of my piece are unframed , and have a pane behind the cover to protect the delicate contents			0
' mr @entity48 has had his work exhibited in the @entity50 and the @entity51 and will be showing his work in @entity53 later this year			0
twists and turns : works are created using only the pictures that are already in the volumes and the end result is a hollowed out book with a layered composition similar to the @entity12 paper theatres that were hugely popular at that time beautiful : the books are sealed around the cut so they can no longer be opened , but are designed to be either hung on the wall or can stand by themselves as an art object painstaking : the @entity16 - based artist , decided to use antiquarian books to deconstruct our ideas of the past he said he came up with the innovative design about five years ago			1
‘ i had been experimenting with paper art , trying out different avenues and making boxed paper constructions , ’ he said			2
' i used all sorts of printed paper for the construction , among them second hand books			1
' it was n’t a giant leap from the boxed art to using the actual book as the enclosure of its original content			0
' but it took me about a year of trial and error to refine the technique into the cut books i makes these days			2
spooky : the books are sealed around the cut so they can no longer be opened , but are designed to be either hung on the wall or can stand by themselves as an art object interesting content : mr @entity4 started exhibiting the books about three years ago and he said it was his mission to deconstruct ideas of the past through his work ' so it was really the result of a process of experimentation			2
he started exhibiting the books about three years ago and he said it was his mission to deconstruct ideas of the past through his work			2
' the three - dimensionality is something that draws people in initially , ' he added			0
' but for me the inspiration starts at the point of choosing a book to work on			0
' then as i work on the piece the planning part is conscious decisions about what i want to make out of the book			0
' there are a lot of unconscious decisions and value judgements that come up in this dialogue with the medium			0
' i try to allow for this element of an almost dreamlike forming of connections with the imagery			0
' inventive : the artist says his inspiration starts at the point of choosing a book to work on complex : the quirky designer says : ' there are a lot of unconscious decisions and value judgements that come up in this dialogue with the medium ' bookworm : the @entity16 - based artist , originally from @entity17 in @entity18 , has created vivid , detailed collages that mix old soldiers standing to attention with giant pink flamingos busy : another of the @entity18 artists designs which features a wealth of different bits of art from chickens to soldiers and flowers to dogs eclectic : this delicate design includes a robin , sculptures and a fish that appears to be floating above the page			1
