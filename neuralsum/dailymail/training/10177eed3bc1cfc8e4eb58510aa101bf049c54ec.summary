viewers have criticised @entity2 medallist @entity1 for not wearing a helmet while cycling around @entity4 for a @entity6 programme on cycling safety			1
hundreds of angry viewers have taken to social media to complain that the champion cyclist set a bad example by wearing dark clothing and no helmet for a cycling safety segment on @entity15 this morning			1
mr @entity1 was shown riding five miles around the streets of @entity4 with presenter @entity17 as he gave his top tips for cycling safely in @entity20 's cities			1
he later said in a video posted on the @entity34 that he did n't wear a helmet because it ' discourages people from riding a bike ' and ' you are as safe riding a bike as you are walking			1
' but more than 300 viewers complained he was being irresponsible for not wearing a helmet , particularly as the segment was shown as children were getting ready for the school run			1
while @entity17 wore a cycle helmet and bright yellow visibility jacket , olympian @entity1 , who has his own brand of cycle helmets , rejected a helmet and wore dark clothing more than 300 viewers took to social media to complain he was being irresponsible for not wearing a helmet viewer @entity54 wrote : ' @entity1 wearing no helmet and riding in black jacket and jeans			1
for an item on cycling safety you ca n't get more stupid			2
' another viewer , @entity61 , added : ' not only is he not wearing a helmet but he 's also wearing dark clothing in stark contrast to the presenter who is appropriately dressed in high a visibility jacket			1
for a so called ' hero ' of cycling he is setting an extremely bad example ! ! ! ' mr @entity1 said in a video posted on the @entity34 that he did not wear a helmet because it ' discourages people ' from riding @entity72 said : ' his comments make me so angry			1
a friend of ours had a serious bike accident and he was told if he had n't been wearing his helmet he would 've been killed			1
' his helmet was smashed up			0
my husband came off once and cracked his helmet			0
if we all took @entity1 boardmans advice , that would 've been his head			2
the man is a fool ! ! ! ' viewer @entity83 said : ' unbelievable ! no helmet and dark clothing - get real mr @entity1 ! ! lack of respect from me i 'm afraid			1
' @entity88 was furious that his children had seen the piece before school and wrote : ' so mr @entity1 will have no problem refunding me for the @entity1 branded helmet i wear ? ' his argument based on general accident statistics is nonsensical and sends a much more dangerous message to children			1
' i have just spent 10 minutes explaining his argument to my three daughters who now question safety and feel less sure about being safe on a bike			2
well done @entity1 , you idiot			2
' viewer @entity103 added : ' i 'm a normal cyclist , i wear normal clothes , i also wear a helmet ! enough said , i now think you 're a bigger idiot than i did before ! you have lost all credibility & respect as has the @entity6 for allowing you air time ! ' mr @entity1 explained his reason for not wearing a helmet in a video posted this morning			1
he said : ' it 's a very long answer and more time than we 've got here , but it discourages people from riding a bike			2
you are as safe riding a bike as you are walking			0
one angry viewer wrote on @entity119 : ' for a so called ' hero ' of cycling he is setting an extremely bad example ' ' statistically you are much safer than going in your own bathroom and you do n't wear a helmet there			1
' there is absolutely nothing wrong with helmets , but it 's not in the top 10 things you can do to keep safe			0
' we 're going to look at all those things , but for me i want bikes to be for normal people in normal clothes			0
' about 0.5 per cent of people wear helmets in the @entity139 and yet it 's the safest country in the world and there 's a reason for that			0
' a @entity6 spokesman said : ' wearing a cycle helmet is not a legal requirement			0
it ’s a matter of individual choice and the @entity6 is not able to force @entity1 to wear one			2
' our presenter @entity17 did wear a helmet during the filming			2
@entity15 has also featured campaigns calling for cycle helmets to be worn			0
' @entity156 , chief executive of @entity157 , the national cycling charity said : ' the furore around @entity1 not wearing a helmet shows how far the health and safety lobby has scared people off from the health and money saving benefits of cycling			1
' instead of relying on polystyrene a better solution would be to create proper provision for cycling so that your child or granny would feel safe on our roads			0
' mr @entity1 defended his choice and said helmets are ' not in the top 10 things you can do to keep safe ' @entity178 , campaigns officer for @entity179 , the road safety charity , said : ' brake encourages cycle helmet use as an easy step to protect yourself from head injury in the event of a crash			1
' however , cycling injuries can take many other forms , which is why the most important thing to focus on is making sure people on bikes are n’t being hit in the first place – by improving driver awareness , rolling out more 20mph limits , and building safe cycle routes into our road infrastructure at every stage			0
' that way , we can create a road environment where far more people feel safe to cycle , and reap the undeniable health , environmental and economic benefits that result			0
' mr @entity1 has also written a statement on the @entity209 website defending his decision to not wear a helmet			2
in it , he wrote : ' people wear helmets and high vis as they feel it ’s all they can do to keep themselves safe			0
it shows just how far away @entity20 is from embracing cycling as a normal and convenient form of transport			0
' he cites @entity223 in the @entity139 , where helmet use is less than 0.5 per cent but they have a good safety record and ' some of the lowest casualty rates of anywhere in the world '			0
he added : ' i want cycling in the @entity20 to be like it is in @entity223 or @entity233 and more recently @entity234 - an everyday thing that people can do in everyday clothes whether you are eight or 80 years old			0
' i want cycling to be a normal thing that normal people do in normal clothes			0
is that wrong ? ' @entity15 is running a week of special reports on cycling and started today with mr @entity1 's top tips for safe cycling			1
the reports come as figures from the @entity247 show that for every hour cycled in @entity249 you are 16 times more likely to be killed or seriously injured on a bike than driving a car			1
the government wants to double the number of cyclists over the next 10 years			0
at the moment only one per cent of journeys under a mile are taken by bike			0
the @entity247 's think ! road safety campaign recommends wearing a correctly fitted cycle helmet , which is securely fastened and conforms to current regulations when cycling .			2

@entity1 was filmed riding a bike around @entity4 as he gave @entity17 his top safety tips for cycling segment on @entity15
but while she was in full safety gear , he wore dark clothing and no helmet
hundreds of viewers took to @entity119 to complain about his ' bad example '
@entity1 has now defended his choice - further *infuriating* viewers
cyclists are 16 times more likely to be killed or injured than car drivers
