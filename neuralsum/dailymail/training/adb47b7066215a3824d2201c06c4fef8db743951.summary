by @entity0 published : 21:38 est , 17 august 2012 updated : 23:27 est , 17 august 2012 a school binder decorated with pictures of a 13 - year - old 's older brother and her softball team nearly led the girl being kicked out of school , her mother claims			1
seen in his military uniform , a photograph of @entity13 's older brother @entity12 who is stationed in @entity14 as a military policeman is one of several pictures on her school binder			1
' my brother is very important to me			0
i have n't seen him in a while , ' @entity13 told @entity22 on her reasoning behind the photo 's placement			1
both pictures , however , as @entity13 recently learned , do not comply with her school 's rules with the eighth grader 's membership of their @entity47 programme for top or advanced students			1
' the counsellor took me out of class twice telling me that the pictures are n't @entity47 material , ' @entity13 said			1
' but they have n't pulled out any other students with pictures out from their class			0
' according to the school , which sent a copy of @entity47 's rules home for her to re-read , all students must ' maintain the @entity47 binder with assignments , grade sheets , and daily notes as required			1
' the issue : the pictures clash with her school 's rules specific for their @entity47 programme 's students which @entity13 is a member of angry : finding that the @entity47 rules do n't list pictures on binders as banned , @entity13 's mother wrote a letter to the school saying her daughter will keep the pictures in place finding school officials ' argument against her daughter 's photographs absurd , and not in conflict with what they had agreed to , @entity13 's mother fired back			1
' these items are in her binder and will remain in her binder			2
the contract does not say a student can not have pictures in the outside sleeve			2
' the principal told me yesterday the rule is based on interpretation			2
having a neat , clean binder is a matter of opinion			0
' we will follow the rules set forth which do not include the removal of photos			0
' ' her brother is a positive role model in her life , ' her mother @entity108 told @entity22			0
' her softball team she 's very active in little league , she has been for six years			0
so , these are things that are happy moments for her			0
' agreement : coming to an agreement , @entity13 was allowed to keep the photo of her brother in her binder but had to remove her softball team after some back and forth , the school came to an amended conclusion this week			1
' we want our students to be successful and if this is the type of motivation that is going to help this young lady or any other student succeed , then by all means we will support her efforts , ' school district spokeswoman @entity125 told @entity22			1
but the picture of her softball team still had to be removed they decided			0
' i 'd rather have my brother in my pictures than have nothing at all , ' @entity13 said			2
' so , i 'm fine with the decision			0
' watch the video here :			0

@entity13 told decorating her school binder was against her school 's *honour* student programme she is a member of
