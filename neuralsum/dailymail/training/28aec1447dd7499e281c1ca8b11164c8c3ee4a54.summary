the @entity14 - built supercar , which retails at £ 175,000 , normally comes in more traditional hues such as blue , black , silver or white			0
but a @entity18 tuning company - a workshop that specialises in souping up cars - has taken the idea of ' pimping your ride ' to the extreme			1
torque of the town : thanks to a £ 90,000 paint job , you will stand out in this £ 265,000 @entity14 - built @entity6 supercar rainbow - coloured : inspired by the classic @entity33 of the 1970s , @entity32 has transformed the @entity6 , built in @entity34 , @entity35 , into an eye - catching coupe inspired by the classic @entity33 of the 1970s , @entity32 has transformed the @entity6 , built in @entity34 , @entity35 , into an eye - catching coupe			1
the tuning house has described the @entity6 - named the @entity40 - as ' an exquisitely colourful piece of art '			1
as well it might be with a total price - tag of more than £ 265,000			0
for that you also get a ' bodykit ' of new exterior accessories including bumper , new lights , new rear spoilier known as a ' wing ' , and a set of 21 - inch alloy wheels to go with the paint job , which looks like it came out of @entity57 neo-pop artist @entity56 ’ studio			0
@entity59 , based in @entity60 , southern @entity18 , said : ' @entity61 , neon yellow @entity62 and even luminous red @entity64 will soon fade away into the background on most streets , as the latest creation from @entity32 steals the show			2
' with the stage set like this , the refined two - seater will transform ugly streets into palatial catwalks , clothing its passengers in magnificent haute couture			0
' flying colours : the @entity6 can accelerate from 0 - 62mph in just 3.1 seconds and hit a top speed of 205mph the @entity33 project began in 1975 when the @entity18 car manufacturer invited @entity57 artist @entity80 to create a canvas on one of its cars			1
since then numerous artists including @entity85 , @entity86 and @entity87 have created their own @entity33			2
with a 3.8 - litre twin - turbocharged @entity88 , the 616bhp @entity6 was developed as a competitor to the @entity90 and is one of the world ’s fastest supercars			1
@entity94 describes it as ' ferociously , apocalyptically quick '			0
the @entity6 can accelerate from 0 - 62mph in just 3.1 seconds and hit a top speed of 205mph			2
