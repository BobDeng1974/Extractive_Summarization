by @entity0 published : 08:56 est , 18 november 2013 updated : 08:57 est , 18 november 2013 thousands of @entity1 could claim compensation after a list made by police in @entity5 was deemed to have breached their human rights			1
@entity8 police said they compiled the list of 4,700 names because it ' helped them tackle crime '			1
however a commission has ruled that the list was prejudicial as it lead to @entity1 being watched who had n't done anything wrong			2
thousands of @entity1 could claim compensation after a ruling that a list of names kept by @entity5 police breached their human rights ( file picture ) the list , which the commission said was the result of several years work , contained the names of 200 dead people , alongside children 's names and those of distant relations of @entity1 living in @entity5			1
@entity8 police could now be in for a bill of hundreds of thousands of pounds following the decision by the @entity36 as every one of the 4,500 living people named are entitled to compensation			2
@entity8 police has claimed the list was assembled to ' fight a criminal network rather than to keep tabs on people of a specific ethnicity			1
' however the ruling found that there was ' no clear reason ' for the list , adding : ' an undefined purpose gives no framework to the personal data , which in practice undermines the protection of individuals ' integrity			0
' @entity5 's national police commissioner @entity55 said : ' i hope and pray to god that this is the only registry of this kind			0
this is completely unacceptable and i can not understand the purpose of it			0
' the list , which included the names of 200 dead people and children , was deemed unlawful because it had ' no clear purpose ' despite officers claiming the used it to fight crime ( file picture ) the news comes just a week after @entity74 human rights campaigners warned that media coverage of missing girls discovered with @entity1 families risked perpetuating ' age old myths ' about the travelling people			1
the case of @entity81 , a blonde girl found living with @entity1 in @entity82 , stunned the nation after she was found to belong to a @entity85 family leading to allegations of kidnap			0
@entity88 , the @entity90 's commissioner for human rights , said : ' most news reports , not only in @entity74 but all over the world , have insisted on the ethnicity of the families from which the children have been taken , thus propagating age - old myths portraying @entity1 as child - abductors			1
' meanwhile @entity99 is preparing to open its doors to thousands of @entity102 and @entity85 immigrants from 2014 as part of @entity105 free - movement agreements			0
while @entity1 make up only a small percentage of the population of @entity102 , some have expressed fears that a disproportionately high number will come because a large number of them live in poverty			0
just last week @entity114 , the former @entity115 home secretary , warned that his constituency of @entity117 could face race riots if the migrants arrive in large numbers			0
he called on @entity1 people to ' change their culture ' and send their children to school to assuage ' understandable tensions ' in the area .			2
