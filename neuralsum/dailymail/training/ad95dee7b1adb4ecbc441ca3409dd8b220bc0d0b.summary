by @entity0 published : 18:35 est , 22 february 2013 updated : 10:20 est , 23 february 2013 there is n’t any shortage of cooking blogs on the web , with as much choice as anyone could want			1
so , when flatmates @entity8 , @entity10 and @entity11 decided to publish their recipes they needed something to make them stand out from the crowd and accidentally sparked an internet craze for baring all in the kitchen			1
@entity18 was launched from the @entity20 kitchen of the three extroverted friends in june 2011 and now has thousands of followers			1
baking : @entity23 from @entity24 , @entity25 , was a fan and decided to contribute to the site co-founders : @entity10 ( left ) shows off her culinary skills , while @entity8 ( right ) described how the site has encouraged discussion of body image as well as ethical food the friends insist that it is entirely non-sexual and co-founder @entity8 recently explained that the site has promoted the discussion of both ethical food and a positive body image			1
in an interview with website goingveryvegan he said : ‘ @entity11 , @entity10 and i had the idea to start @entity18 when we all moved in together two years ago			2
‘ we decided to team up and create a blog to share our recipes			2
at the time we thought of the idea , @entity11 happened to be in the kitchen cooking naked and @entity18 was born			1
‘ we soon realised that by being naked we can talk about some of the issues that we care about – creating positive body image , showing real naked bodies in a world of photoshopped , unrealistic images , and feminism			1
’ @entity53 : enthusiastic fan of the site @entity56 submitted his pie recipe best friends : the whole gang get involved with a fun group photo delicacy : @entity62 contributes a photo of a steak sandwich for the site although the idea was originally a ‘ gimmick ’ , the founders insist that there is not ‘ an airbrush in sight ’ and that they publish pictures of real people in their natural state			1
now , fans of the site ’s ethos send in their own recipes and photographs to be featured on @entity18			1
with 1,600 likes on @entity81 , and 2,600 people following them on @entity84 , the threesome are considering writing an anthology of essays			2
when asked if she had had any cooking mishaps , @entity8 , whose favourite recipe is for @entity90 , replied : ‘ i ’ve had a couple , in the early days when deep frying falafel			1
‘ we quickly learned that aprons are not the enemy			2
’ the site received even more publicity last month when @entity8 was featured on @entity100 ’s ‘ my daughter the @entity99 ’ , something that @entity8 described as a ‘ scary prospect ’ but that they received a very positive response			1
despite their strong ethical message , @entity8 , who was put off meat after watching @entity109 , said that they do not want to pressure people , and that @entity112 is ‘ one option among many different options			2
’ he said : ‘ to be honest i cheat a fair bit			2
i do n’t think the odd bit of cheating is a bad thing			0
‘ i kind of have this impression that a lot of vegans are obsessed with “ purity ” ; scouring ingredients for small traces of animal products that probably do n’t make a massive impact on animal suffering			0
’ he added : ‘ @entity112 is not the revolution			0
’ ingredients : one large onion ( finely chopped ) 2 - 3 sticks of celery ( fine chopped ) olive oil2 - 3 slices of crumbled wholemeal bread2 stock cubes / or 2tsp bullion powder350g mushrooms ( sliced ) , bunch of parsley ( fine chopped ) , 1 head of garlic ( roughly chopped ) 1 tbsp marmite / yeast extract , 300gtoasted hazelnutssalt and pepper to taste 2 slices of wholemeal bread per person vegan margarine @entity147 sweat down the onion , celery and garlic in a largish pot with a generous amount of olive oil			0
when the onions are clear , add the mushrooms , stock powder , and hazelnuts			0
once the mushrooms have softened and start to get juicy , crumble in the bread , and add in the chopped parsley and yeast extract			0
add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste – be really generous with the salt , it makes a huge difference			0
pop the mixture in a blender and blend smooth			0
to make the sesame toast , place your bread in the toaster or under the grill as usual , then thickly spread one side with butter			0
cover the buttered surface of the toast with a coating of sesame seeds			0
cut into triangles and serve with the pate			0
