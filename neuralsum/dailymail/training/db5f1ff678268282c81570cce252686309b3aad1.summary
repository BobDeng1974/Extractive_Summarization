by @entity0 published : 08:16 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 03:17 est , 17 september 2013 @entity1 , 50 , killed himself at his army barracks in @entity3 , southern @entity4 a @entity5 suspected of murdering his wife and daughter placed a noose around his neck and then jumped from a window at his army barracks , it has emerged			1
horrified witnesses were on their way to breakfast when @entity1 , 50 , committed suicide at around 6am at the site in @entity3 , southern @entity4 on august 5			1
official @entity4 sources had previously reported that the @entity19 - born officer had hanged himself behind a closed door in a toilet after he was questioned about the disappearance of his wife @entity23 , 53 , and their 19 year old daughter @entity24 on july 14			1
@entity1 is said to have left a video message and a letter protesting his innocence			0
however , speaking to newspaper @entity29 , the witness portrayed a very different scene			0
sources in @entity3 suggested that his public suicide may have been meant to impress fellow soldiers with his sense of honour and shame at being suspected by @entity4 police			1
the disappearance of @entity23 , 53 , and @entity24 , 19 , was initially treated as a missing persons case			1
but suspicion began to mount after their @entity41 and @entity42 pages were n't updated and neither used their bank account or answered their phone			0
the pair also left behind their car and pet dog , a sign - say the family ’s neighbours - that they did not intend to stay out long			0
mr @entity1 claimed the two women had left @entity3 permanently and gone to @entity52 , but his story was undermined when police recovered the pair 's passports in the family home			1
in the days following the two women 's disappearance @entity1 drove an estimated 4,500 kilometers in his car			2
missing : @entity1 's daughter @entity24 ( right ) , 19 , and his wife @entity62 ( left ) , 53 , disappeared on july 14 and have not been seen since in august , blood containing @entity24 's dna was found in a freezer that @entity1 and another soldier moved from his apartment in @entity3 to the barracks			1
her blood was also found in a washing machine the soldier used to wash his clothes			2
investigators concluded the freezer had been scoured and washed along with a carpet a few days after the two vanished			0
last week , it emerged that in the weeks before she and her mother vanished , 19 - year - old @entity24 - who was due to take part in the @entity79 contest - had begun a personal investigation into her father			2
it has been claimed she believed he was leading a double life with a @entity19 mistress			0
@entity4 police are to question the @entity19 woman , whom he is known to have phoned two hours before his death			2
mounting suspicion against @entity1 has also led to speculation that he may have been involved in the disappearance of another of his mistresses , a @entity96 woman who vanished in 2004			1
model looks : @entity24 had been due to take part in the @entity79 contest before her disappearance @entity1 was known to have been involved in an affair with @entity102 , a waitress in a bar in @entity104			1
the last sign of life from @entity102 , was a text message sent from her phone , telling @entity1 she was leaving him			0
@entity1 told police the two had had a fierce argument , which @entity114 ’s sister 's @entity112 recently suggested could have happened after she discovered @entity1 had n’t yet separated from his wife @entity23			1
the former mistress 's sister even claimed that her she had been pregnant with @entity1 ’s child at the time she disappeared			2
he was questioned about her disappearance and a murder investigation was launched			0
@entity102 's body was never found			0
the @entity5 was founded in 1831 to enable foreigners to sign up and fight for @entity4			0
