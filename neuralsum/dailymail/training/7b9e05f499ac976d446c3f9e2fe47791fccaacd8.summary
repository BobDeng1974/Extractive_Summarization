by @entity0 the @entity1 today apologised after a weather bulletin warned festival - goers heading to @entity4 to ' prepare for rape '			1
the blunder appeared in a subtitle on a forecast broadcast live on @entity1 after the 10pm news			1
stunned viewers were warned to ' prepare for rape ' rather than to ' prepare for rain ' as experts predicted stormy weather would hit the @entity14 this week			1
blunder : viewers were quick to photograph the subtitle blunder after @entity17 when they were told to expect ' rape ' at @entity4 , which kicks off this weekend , rather than ' rain ' as predicted after spotting they had typed the word ' rape ' instead of ' rain ' subtitle writers quickly corrected the message			1
they wrote : ' as we head into thursday , people going to @entity4 will want to prepare for rape because this rain is heading - prepare for rain because this rain is heading right for you			1
' but spectators were quick to take photographs of the blunder and post it on social media website @entity35			2
one viewer said : ' i was shocked when the word ‘ rape ’ popped up on my screen during the weather forecast as i ’d just turned the sound down			1
' i wondered what on earth was going on until they started typing about rain			2
it was a very unfortunate mistake to make			0
' the gates at @entity4 open today with music starting on friday			1
anxious : thousands of @entity4 ticket - holders were tuning in to catch the forecast ahead of the festival embarrassing : the @entity1 marks the @entity54 by welcoming viewers into the ' year of the whores ' during a bulletin in january			1
the channel later insisted the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to ' horse ' error : a reporter 's comment that ' pigs nibble anything , even wellies ' takes on a different meaning when the last word is substituted for ' willies '			0
the mistake in 2011 later fuelled a @entity71 subtitles gaffes segment mistake : another blunder sees a court reporter quoted as saying : ' and the cat 's pornography reading was low ' on january 31 , viewers watching a bulletin about @entity54 were welcomed into ' the year of the whores ' - rather than ' horse '			1
more recently , a reporter 's comment that pig nibble on ' wellies ' was translated to ' willies ' - to the amusement of hundreds of @entity87 users and comedians			1
and on @entity90 , the subtitle writers had a hard time getting to grips with the spelling of @entity94 , opting instead for ' @entity96 jazz jam '			0
@entity99 indie rock band @entity98 headline the @entity4 on friday night before heavy metal band @entity101 play on the same stage on saturday			1
@entity14 rock band @entity103 will close the festival on sunday night			0
around 175,000 music fans will attend the festival which takes place near @entity108 , @entity109 , all as per tradition , most have been nervously waiting for weather forecasts to tell them what to expect			0
a @entity1 spokeswoman said : ' we try to ensure our subtitling is as accurate as possible but there are occasions when mistakes inevitably occur			1
' on this occasion the result was this unfortunate typo which was corrected as soon as possible			0
' hilarious subtitle blunders have aired on the @entity1 over the years - leaving both staff and viewers lost for words			2
they are among many mistakes to have prompted a crackdown on the quality of subtitles , with a report set to be published by @entity133 this spring			0
one gaffe sees the broadcaster mark the @entity54 by welcoming viewers into the ' year of the whores '			0
the subtitling error , which happened during a bulletin at around 7pm on january 31 , saw @entity17 declare : ‘ welcome to the year of the whores			1
people around the globe celebrate			0
’ however , the channel later insisted that the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to the ' year of the horse ’			0
lost in translation : last sunday , the @entity1 struggled to get to grips with the name of footballer @entity94 - misspelling his name as ' @entity96 jazz , jazz jam '			2
however , it correctly spelled the names of other players shocking : a man sees his son @entity154 's name changed to ' phrase whore ' in one particularly toe - curling blunder another blunder sees a reporter 's comment that ' pigs nibble anything , even wellies ' take on a completely different meaning when the last word is substituted for ' willies '			0
the mistake , which happened during a news report in 2011 , soon went viral on @entity87 - and even fuelled a @entity71 subtitles gaffes segment			2
and during a football match , the @entity1 struggled to get to grips with the name of 18 - year - old winger , @entity94 , who broke into the @entity175 team last season			2
the broadcaster correctly spelled the names of other @entity175 players @entity179 , @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 - before stumbling over the youngster 's name			0
its hilarious attempts at janet , jazz , jazz and jam left those watching the programme with subtitles scratching their heads as they tried to work out what was actually being said			0
and it is n't the first time the @entity1 has misspelled a name to amusing effect			2
the broadcaster has previously referred to @entity202 prime minister @entity201 as ' mr @entity203 ' - while @entity205 leader @entity204 became ' @entity206 ' .			0

weather forecast of rain was translated as ' rape ' after @entity17
thousands were tuning in to catch predictions ahead of @entity4
*sparked* @entity87 *flurry* with *dozens* *tweeting* pictures of blunder
@entity1 later forced to apologise and correct the bulletin to ' rain '
