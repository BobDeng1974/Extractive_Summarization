state hospital : @entity1 , pictured , will now head to the states ' mental hospital for evaluation and treatment after stabbing her mother to death last august a @entity9 teenager who was accused of stabbing her mother 151 times last summer will not be going to jail after having had her insanity plea accepted by the court			1
@entity14 - @entity13 , 19 , is accused of killing her mother in their @entity16 home in august 2013			1
last december she pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and was sent to a state mental hospital for an evaluation			1
at a court hearing on thursday , a judge reviewed the results of that mental evaluation and ruled that @entity26 is not guilty by reason of insanity			1
she has been sent to the @entity28 of @entity29			1
judicial district attorney @entity30 said , ' look , the job of the district attorney is to pursue justice			2
and at first blush , when you look at this case , you see a horrific and violent murder by a daughter towards her mother			1
i 've never seen a person with that many stab wounds			2
she stabbed her over 150 times			1
so you want that person to be held accountable			2
' but our system is a system that is not just conviction - laden or prison - laden , but justice - bound , and you have to look at this component , which is mental health , ' @entity30 stressed			1
@entity30 said the @entity49 had a longer than normal opportunity to review @entity26 's mental health			1
' they had an opportunity to administer and tweak the drugs that might affect her psychology , ' he said			2
' the end conclusion was that she suffers from a mental illness that kept her from being able to form the ability to know right from wrong -- both legally and morally			2
' during testimony , dr. @entity63 said @entity26 was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia			2
' there were obvious signs of hallucinating , ' @entity63 said			2
' she was staring into space , having conversations with people who were not present , and she was laughing at herself			0
' when asked how long @entity26 might be at the @entity49 , @entity30 said , ' for an indeterminate period of time			1
' no jail : @entity1 will not go to prison , but will be sent to the @entity49 in @entity29 for treatment ' it will be until these state doctors determine that she is no longer a risk or threat to herself or the community			1
it could be a year , two years			0
it could be the remainder of her life , ' @entity30 added			0
' these are tough decisions on their face , ' @entity30 said , ' because you have someone who committed such a violent act of murder against a completely innocent and defenseless woman			2
her mother was in the shower when she stabbed her 151 times			1
but , we 're not in the business of just locking up everybody who has transgressed the law â€¦ we punish people who make decisions to do wrong when they knew better and could have done something differently			0
' @entity30 said that , in this particular case , he 's convinced , based on the evidence he 's seen , that @entity26 did not know right from wrong			2
' i was convinced of it , ' he said			0
' and in the interest of justice i had to take these steps			0
' it was originally reported that @entity26 had stabbed her mom , 47 - year - old @entity110 , 79 times in the face and neck , but court testimony indicated she actually stabbed her mother 151 times in total , including 35 times in the face and 51 times in the neck			1
she then finished her off by beating her with a baseball bat			0
what lurks beneath : @entity26 appears like any normal teenager in this picture from her @entity127 profile how could she ? in the horrifying attack , @entity26 stabbed her mother in the face , neck , arms and torso on aug. 28 , 2013			1
she also beat her with a baseball bat according to the affidavit , @entity1 had grown ' more threatening and disrespectful ' towards her mother leading up to her death			1
it 's still unclear what exactly her mother was worried about , but neighbors had called the police in the past when they saw men jumping over a fence into the family 's backyard			1
those men were later discovered to be @entity1 's boyfriends paying her a visit			1
the day before her mother was killed , @entity1 spit on her mother and sent her an email threatening : ' you will pay			1
' earlier on the day of the attack , @entity16 police officers came to their house on a report of a family dispute			0
officers said they found no hostility or rage at the house			0
hidden rage : @entity16 police officers came to their house on a report of a family dispute			0
officers said they found no hostility or rage at the house they warned @entity26 , who was 18 at the time , that her mother could kick her out of the house for her behavior			2
it seemed to calm @entity26 down and she stayed in her room most of the day , her stepfather , @entity170 , said			0
mrs @entity110 had grown so scared of her daughter , that she called on her ex-husband , @entity1 's father @entity26 , to speak to the teenager			1
just three hours before mrs @entity110 way murdered , @entity26 paid a visit to the house his daughter lived in with his ex-wife and her new husband , @entity170			0
as they sat in the backyard , he explained the importance of respecting your elders , and truly believed he had gotten through to her			0
' in the conversation , i thought that i made progress , ' mr @entity26 said , ' but obviously it did n't do nothing , because hours later , this thing happened			0
' then at 10:11 p.m. , the stepfather called 911 to report that the teen was beating his wife in a locked bathroom			0
mrs @entity110 's husband @entity170 was home when the fight broke out			2
he says his wife had just returned from work around 9:30pm when she went upstairs to take a shower			0
mr @entity170 was eating when he heard a thumping sound upstairs and his wife calling his name			0
he ran to the upstairs bathroom , but @entity1 quickly shut and locked the door and he noticed blood streaming under the door			1
insane : @entity26 had a contentious relationship with her mother , @entity14 - @entity110 , who had been concerned enough with the teen 's threatening behavior to call police not guilty : a judge declared @entity1 insane and she has been sent to a state mental hospital for evaluation soon after , @entity1 emerged from the bathroom and walked out holding the knife , staring straight forward as she passed her stepfather and went downstairs			1
mr @entity170 tried to revive his wife but knew she was already dead by the look in her eyes			0
when police arrived they officially pronounced mrs @entity110 dead			0
@entity16 police officer @entity224 described the scene as ' pretty gruesome '			0
pretty gruesome : police arrived and found mrs @entity110 already dead , having suffered 78 stab wounds to the neck and face @entity1 had since left the scene of the crime , and was n't tracked down until noon the next day			1
after the killing , police say @entity26 fled the home			0
she went to a woman 's restroom at a nearby @entity237 , washed her hair in the sink and changed her clothes			2
they say she told employees that she had been raped in @entity243 and asked them not to call police , because they would send her back home and she was in fear of her father			0
when police tracked @entity26 down the next day , she told them they had the wrong person			0
she said she was @entity250 from @entity251 , @entity252			0
police held up her id card , but the teen said , ' it looks like me , but it 's not			2
' eventually police discovered @entity1 leaving the parking garage			1
witnesses watched as three police officers pulled out guns and ordered the teen to the ground , and took her into custody			0
shocked : @entity1 's father @entity26 had spoken with his daughter just three hours before the killing , on behalf of his fearful ex-wife			1

@entity271 , @entity272 was discovered stabbed 151 times in the face and neck
@entity278 judge accepted the teenager 's plea of not guilty by reason of insanity
@entity1 , 19 , will not go to prison , but instead will be sent to the @entity49 in @entity29 for treatment
she had become ' more threatening and disrespectful ' towards her mother
