by @entity0 published : 23:55 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 03:42 est , 21 may 2013 more than 15,000 people in @entity5 die every year as a result of cancer treatments rather than the disease itself , lord @entity2 has said			1
the @entity11 peer said he had been given the estimate from someone in the medical profession			1
the advertising mogul has been campaigning for law changes to enable more innovation in treatment since his wife , novelist @entity20 , died from a form of ovarian cancer in 2011			1
campaign : @entity2 ( right ) with his wife @entity20 who died in 2011 from cancer lord @entity2 said : ' the point is we do n't know if it is 1 per cent of patients or 100 per cent of patients who die as a result of the treatment			1
' what we do know is that the cancer drugs do such damage to the immune system that the patient is helpless to resist fatal infections like @entity37 or @entity38 or septicaemia			2
' he said the @entity41 under @entity43 guidelines only recorded ' the single underlying cause of death '			0
@entity45 said statistics were collected for when cancer was the cause of death but not when treatment of cancer was the cause of death ' in other words it does n't record what is known as the sequence of causation , sometimes known as the sequence of conditions that led to the actual death , ' he said			0
at question time in the @entity63 , he asked health minister @entity64 : ' as this is supposed to be the era of big data , will you review the limitations of cancer mortality statistics in order to assist scientists and doctors to have the information to move forward innovation towards a cure for cancer ? ' @entity45 said statistics were collected for when cancer was the cause of death but not when treatment of cancer was the cause of death			2
he agreed it was ' important to have more information about the effect of cancer treatments on mortality ' but added that " new data collections " were under way to provide more detail			2
he said new figures would provide better information about deaths following the delivery of chemotherapy while others statistics would give information about death after surgical treatment			0
but he warned : ' it can be very hard to identify the precise cause or sequence of progression of factors resulting in death , particularly for those with end - stage cancer or who are particularly frail and are experiencing physical deterioration			0
' so this can never i think be a precise science			0
