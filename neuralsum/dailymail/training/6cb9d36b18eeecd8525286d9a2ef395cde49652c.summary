he now hopes to get back dancing and resume his apprenticeship with the prestigious @entity26 : @entity28 company in @entity29			2
his family claim it was the ballet training that saved @entity6 ’s life by enabling him to recover so quickly			1
@entity6 said : ' ballet is my passion and this incident has made me realise that now more than ever			1
i do n’t want this injury to define me or my career			1
' with long and difficult hydrotherapy and physiotherapy sessions , i keep focussed on the end goal , which is to dance again and hopefully continue my apprenticeship			0
' the support that i have received from family , friends , colleagues and tutors both in the @entity47 and @entity29 has been overwhelming and their messages really helped			0
' especially in those first few weeks when it was taking an enormous amount of effort and concentration just to re-learn how to do everyday activities such as holding a cup on my own and playing hangman with family members			0
' rising star : jack in his days as a member of the @entity26 : ballet company @entity29			2
he is determined to return to his apprenticeship before too long @entity6 ’s family , including parents @entity18 and @entity19 , two brothers @entity66 and @entity20 and sister @entity68 , held a bedside vigil after the attack in @entity13 on november 5			2

his dad dr @entity81 , 52 , head of sports medicine at @entity84 and @entity85 , said he could not believe how much progress he had made			0
he said : ' it feels like an absolute miracle			0
' when @entity6 first regained consciousness we were unsure of the extent of the long - term damage and feared that he may have been paralysed from the neck down			1
' however , by some stroke of fate this was not the case and a number of small , positive signs gave us hope			0
' up until a week ago we did n’t really expect to have a @entity5 this year , however , now that @entity6 is back home and showing such strong signs of recovery we really do feel it is an occasion to celebrate			1

but 19 - year - old is now well enough to enjoy @entity5 at home
' @entity28 is my passion *...* i do n’t want this injury to define me or my career '
