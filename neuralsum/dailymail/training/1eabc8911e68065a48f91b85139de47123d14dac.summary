@entity0 are exploring the feasibility of bringing @entity2 back to @entity3			1
the 36 - year - old has interest from clubs in @entity7 while @entity8 continue to flirt with the idea of taking him to @entity11			1
yet @entity12 has a strong relationship with the @entity14 and is interested in the idea of him taking on a player - coach role			1
@entity12 has great affection for @entity2 and knows he could have great influence on a squad that is changing this summer			2
he declared prior to the @entity38 tie with @entity39 in march that @entity2 could return and is keen to fulfil that wish			0
@entity2 won three @entity42 titles , four @entity43 and the @entity38 while at @entity0 and @entity12 wants to use that experience to good effect with his new additions			1
@entity47 has arrived from @entity48 with compatriot @entity49 expected to follow			0
@entity50 has arrived and will go out on loan possibly to @entity52 while another centre - back , midfielder and striker are still to be recruited			1
@entity2 's friend , @entity56 though could yet depart with @entity57 and @entity58 at the fore for the the 32 - year - old			1
return ? @entity2 was @entity0 's hero in the 2012 @entity38 final win over @entity62 @entity63 face a dilemma after @entity66 's declaration that he would like to leave			1
they have invested heavily in @entity68 and his age dictates they should possibly look for an established defender to replace @entity66 and share the burden of being @entity63 's first choice left - back			2
options : @entity63 have talked about @entity76 of @entity77 and @entity78 of @entity79 native : @entity81 may look towards @entity83 international @entity82 however , they have spoken about @entity85 and @entity87 target @entity76 of @entity77 and @entity78 of @entity79 who are both 21			1
another player that has impressed is @entity82 who is 24			0
the @entity83 does fall into the category that @entity81 likes of being able to play in a couple of positions but he may be short of pace to play left - back in the @entity42			2
@entity66 will be sorely missed at @entity96 as he moves on to @entity8 and he may be followed out the door by quite a few names yet			0
@entity99 likes to work with a relatively small squad of around 22 players but @entity63 already have a first team squad pushing 40 in number			0
near : barring an unexpected u-turn , @entity8 are confident of concluding a deal by the end of this week @entity108 midfielder @entity107 is still considering the option of choosing @entity110 as his next destination			1
the 34 - year - old has two more years left on contract but is expected to depart			1
he had an outline agreement with @entity115 for £ 6.4m over six months and other offers in @entity7 with @entity118 's @entity117 interested			2
@entity63 were also reputed to have made an approach but @entity107 wants to take a step down with friends saying he is tired mentally and physically after 16 seasons at the top			2
the idea of @entity110 appeals as he would join friends @entity125 and @entity127 plus @entity128			0
also the franchise does n't begin till next year so gives him time to re-charge			0
reports have claimed @entity110 has already allocated its designated player budget but the @entity132 is exploring possible changes to fit in with sensible financial management			0
options : @entity107 's future is unclear , but the @entity137 has plenty of options around the world @entity141 are hopeful of finalising the transfer of @entity143 from @entity144 ahead of competition from @entity146			1
the 25 - year - old scored all three of @entity149 's goals at the finals in @entity151 as they went out in the group stages			1
@entity153 , @entity154 and @entity155 have also shown an interest with @entity144 looking for £ 12million but a deal could be struck at around £ 10m with @entity144 looking to maintain a sell - on clause			2
@entity144 club president @entity159 said : ' there are various offers for @entity143 , the strongest and closest to what the player and us are demanding is from a club from @entity166			0
we are making huge steps to finalise the negotiation			0
from midfield : @entity141 are hopeful of finalising the transfer of @entity172 @entity143 talking to @entity174 , he added : ' we are seeking the possibility that is convenient for him and the club and that he is sold for the price that we like for everything the @entity182 league is worth			1
' we want to keep a percentage of the player in case he is sold in the future to another big team in @entity188			0
i wo n't talk about prices , but if he is sold , it will be the highest transfer fee ever in @entity182 football , otherwise he wo n't be sold			0
' it hurts me , i do n't want to sell him and neither does the manager or the fans but we ca n't go against the career the kid aspires to , first because of the salary that they pay there , five times bigger ( than what he is paid here ) and he also wants to prove himself in the best league in the world , which is the @entity42 and that will make @entity144 very proud as we will be sending other players to @entity188			0
' @entity210 are in discussions with former @entity213 midfielder @entity212			1
the 31 - year - old rejected a contract offer from @entity216 and is a free agent			1
@entity216 said : ' @entity212 has been a great servant to the club and a fantastic lad to have in the dressing room			0
there was a contact there , but we have made signings now and @entity212 wanted to keep his options open so all we can do now is wish him all the very best for the future			0
' up north : @entity212 ( right ) rejected a contract offer from @entity213 boss @entity216 the @entity231 international has had interest from @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 but likes the idea of teaming up with @entity238 at the @entity239			1

the @entity244 champions , who completed the signing @entity247 from @entity249 on wednesday			0
@entity155 have not given up on the possibility of signing @entity251 from @entity234 for his designated £ 8million buy - out			1
@entity253 have long been considered favourites but @entity155 are hoping @entity251 has been put off by the prospect of being on the sidelines while @entity257 and @entity258 dominate the starting slots			2

@entity253 have enquired about @entity262 the @entity48 right - back			0
