by @entity0 published : 09:49 est , 17 march 2014 updated : 11:46 est , 17 march 2014 a controversial @entity3 programme which sent an undercover team into @entity5 , pretending to be a group of @entity8 students , has breached a number of editorial guidelines			1
a report by the corporation 's @entity12 said the @entity3 failed to ensure the students were aware of the risks involved in the trip			1
the @entity3 has subsequently apologised to the university after the publication concluded @entity8 experienced ' unfair treatment ' because it ended up being linked to the controversial investigation			2
dangerous investigation : @entity3 reporter @entity22 pretended to be a student when he went on a trip to @entity5 to film a special programme for the programme , @entity3 , reporter @entity22 spent eight days in the pariah state , joining an organised tour which had been planned by his wife , @entity30			1
when the film came to light , it was condemned by senior officials from the university who asked for the programme not to be shown			2
but it was screened as planned in april 2013 , leading to a complaint from the father of one of the students involved			0
although the @entity12 believed there was a ' strong public interest ' in the broadcast , it said the @entity3 ' failed to consider a number of important issues and risks , and failed to deal with them appropriately '			1
in its report published today , the @entity12 ’s editorial standards committee said : ' the provision of information to the students who took part in the trip was insufficient and inadequate , and meant the daughter of the complainant did not possess the knowledge necessary to give informed consent			1
' danger : members of the group from the @entity8 were put at risk , the @entity12 concluded in order to gain the appropriate paperwork , the team had used @entity8 address details for their visa applications			1
today ’s report said doing so was ' inappropriate and this , combined with other factors , risked linking the @entity8 with the trip and resulted in unfair treatment to the @entity8 '			2
it went on : ' from the moment the @entity3 became involved in the trip to @entity5 , @entity30 ( who was the trip organiser and tour leader ) had a conflict of interest which was further compounded when she became employed by the @entity3			0
' the @entity3 should have ensured there was someone independent of the programme team present to lead the trip			0
@entity85 , who chairs the @entity12 ’s editorial standards committee , said : ' discovering stories in difficult or dangerous places is one of the @entity3 ’s greatest strengths			1
' there was a real public interest in making this programme in @entity5 but , in the @entity12 ’s view , the @entity3 failed to ensure that all the young adults @entity3 travelled with were sufficiently aware of any potential risks to enable them to give informed consent			1
condemnation : a report published by the @entity12 said there were ' serious failings ' in the organisation of the investigative programme which was broadcast last year ' this was a serious failing , and the @entity3 is right to apologise to the complainants			2
' @entity22 was also accompanied by a cameraman / producer from @entity3 in order to make their film and they travelled around the country on a tour given by @entity5 guides , and they recorded their visit on the sort of cameras tourists would use , rather than taking specialist equipment			0
the @entity12 found that the problems lay with the gathering rather than the broadcast of the material			0
at the time of the broadcast concerns were raised about the impact the programme could have on academics working in sensitive areas around the world			0
following their return from the £ 2,000 - a - head trip , the students were said to have received an email from a @entity5 tourism official which said : ' i reserve the right to make public and publish all personal data , including all your passports , to demonstrate that while we have been direct and honest with you , you have broken the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) law			0
' tensions : tourists have begun to visit the rogue state more frequently , but the group of students allegedly received threats from @entity147 after the programme was aired @entity149 said it accepted the @entity12 's decision and said it had apologised to the @entity8 and the student - referred to as @entity152 - whose father had complained			1
but it said that at the time the programme was being made , it believed they were being treated ' fairly '			0
in a statement , @entity149 said : ' we are pleased that the @entity12 found that there was a clear and strong public interest in commissioning and broadcasting the programme and that the correct referral procedures and processes were followed by the programme team and senior management			1
' we also accept , however , that aspects of the @entity3 's handling of the project fell short in a number of areas , with the @entity12 finding against the @entity3 on four of its 21 rulings			0
' in particular we have apologised to @entity152 for the finding by the @entity12 that insufficient information was given to her ahead of the trip about the involvement of the @entity3 journalists and the potential risks , which meant that @entity152 did not have sufficient knowledge on which to give informed consent			0
we have also apologised to the @entity8 for the @entity12 's finding that the programme created the risk of harm to the @entity8 's reputation			1
contact : on their return , the students , who visited a number of attractions in the pariah state during their time received an email saying they had ' broken the law ' ' @entity193 recognised that this programme involved a number of finely - balanced editorial judgments and that the @entity3 spent considerable time evaluating the risks in circumstances which were highly unusual			2
in the planning for and making of the programme , @entity149 believed that it was treating all the students and the @entity8 fairly			2
' during its investigation , the committee was told that the @entity3 's risk assessment had determined that if the team was discovered , they would try to ' separate ' themselves from the students but this could have led to them being more vulnerable			0
' the committee considered that , while this might well have been a tactic aimed at isolating the students from further risk , it would inevitably have had the effect of preventing @entity30 acting primarily as group leader , and that the students would have been left , in effect , as a group of young adults from a variety of different countries , all personally responsible for trying to extricate themselves from possible detention , ' the report said			0
the @entity3 says it has apologised to the university , but suggested there was a ' public interest ' in airing the investigation it concluded that it was not viable for her to lead the trip and be certain of being able to act in the best interests of the students in @entity5 from the moment the @entity3 became involved			1
but her relationship with @entity22 was not itself a conflict of interest			0
director of the @entity8 , professor @entity237 , said : ' @entity8 welcomes the finding of the @entity239 and the letter of apology issued to the school by the @entity243			0
' @entity8 would like to confirm its strong support for the production of programmes in the public interest and for journalists working to highlight important issues in dangerous parts of the world			1
