by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 06:50 est , 22 april 2013 a woman who used to be mistaken for overweight soap character @entity2 after her weight reached 23 stone has shed more than half her bodyweight - and is now a trim size 10			1
@entity7 used to overindulge on junk food and sit in front of the television watching soaps every day , resulting in her piling on the pounds and becoming morbidly obese			1
her size 26 frame was so big that she would n't go on public transport or on fairground rides because she took up two seats			1
what a difference : @entity7 , 23 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , dropped from 23st and a size 26 to a trim 10st 12lbs and size 10 , by adopting a more healthy diet doppelganger ? @entity7 used to be compared to the @entity25 character of @entity2 , played by @entity26 , before she dropped the weight @entity7 was even likened to @entity28 star @entity26 , better known as @entity2 from the tv soap @entity25 , when she went out			1
but now , having dropped to a svelte size 10 and after losing a staggering seven stone in just six months , she says she gets compared to sexy soap star @entity32			1
after three years of hard work and determination she now weighs just 10st 12lb			2
before , @entity7 's diet consisted of a @entity37 for breakfast , big baguettes and crisps for lunch and fatty meals like lasagne and chips in the evening with at least 12 bars of chocolate a day as snacks			1
@entity7 , 23 , from @entity18 , @entity19 , said : ' my calorie intake was unreal			2
it was more the quantity , the amount of food i was eating and i did n't exercise - i was so lazy			1
morbidly obese : @entity7 's weight spiralled as she spent her evenings sitting in front of the television eating junk food disciplined : @entity7 lost the first seven stone in a remarkable six months and continued to drop the pounds through regular exercise and a diet of 1,500 calories a day ' at 23 stone , i was miserable			1
i wanted to look like an @entity64 @entity63 , not @entity2			2
my confidence evaporated and i stopped going out with my mates			0
instead i stayed at home in my comfort zone , gorging on cakes and chocolate , slumped in front of the soaps			0
' it took over my life			0
i was embarrassed by my size so i would sit in and binge - it was a vicious circle			0
it was a lonely place to be			0
' after being told by doctors she would not be able to conceive naturally if she did n't dramatically change her lifestyle , @entity7 decided to use this blow as her ' thinspiration ' to take action			1
unhealthy : @entity7 was told by doctors she would not be able to conceive naturally if she did n't dramatically change her lifestyle trapped : @entity7 describes how she was caught in a vicious cycle of binge eating and over-indulging on comfort food she became a fitness fanatic , embarking on long runs five days a week , going to the gym and doing spinning classes , and stripped back to a diet of fruit , vegetables , lean meat and fish			1
the coffee shop worker said : ' i decided enough was enough			0
i looked like a fat soap character but i was the only one who could change that			0
i wanted to walk into a room and be noticed but not as the ' fat one with a pretty face			0
' i wanted to feel sexy and be me again			0
' i was like a bull in a china shop , exercising and sticking to 1,500 calories a day			1
' recalling the start of her diet in september 2009 , she said : ' it was like a drug addiction but with food and chocolate - i had withdrawal symptoms			2
i was nasty , aggressive and snappy at first but then i would go for a run and it would make me feel amazing			0
@entity7 was motivated by the thought of having children and says she was tired as being seen as the ' fat girl with a pretty face ' and wanted to feel sexy again the dramatic weight loss helped @entity7 to conceive naturally			1
she gave birth to @entity124 , now two and a half , in february 2010			2
that gave her even more motivation to continue with her new regime and she is now enjoying a new lease of life and her new slim frame after three years of hard work			0
@entity7 , who has since split with her partner , added : ' my son was my only motivation			1
i was not going to be the fat mum at the school gates and have him bullied because of my size			0
' i feel a lot more confident now and sexy			0
i have lost the old me and gained this amazing confidence			0
' now people compare me to @entity32 instead of @entity2 , which is a huge compliment .			2
