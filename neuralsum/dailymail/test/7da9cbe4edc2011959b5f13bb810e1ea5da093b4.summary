fears for two new strains of influenza , which caused a spike in deaths in @entity5 and the @entity6 , will see the arrival of an improved vaccination on @entity10 shores			1
stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against @entity15 strain @entity16 and @entity18 / @entity17			2
the decision to include both was triggered by a spike in flu - related deaths in the northern hemisphere as the vaccine was not a good match to fight against the two types of flu			0
stocks of the influenza vaccine are arriving a month later than expected as scientists have included protection against two new strains high - risk groups - such as the very young and very old , and most indigenous @entity10 - will be able to access free , government - funded flu shots from april 20			1
experts say the modified version of the vaccination is worth waiting for			0
but dr @entity36 , who chairs the @entity37 , said everyone should be getting the vaccine , which also provided protection against @entity15 strain @entity40			0

' dr @entity36 said people should be booking their flu shots now , given the delay in stocks arriving			0
' even if people are not in one of the high - risk groups , they are probably coming into contact with people in their own families who are , ' he said			1
