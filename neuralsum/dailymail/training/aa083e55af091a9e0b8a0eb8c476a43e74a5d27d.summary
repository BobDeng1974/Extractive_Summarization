scientists have been attempting to create invisibility cloaks long before @entity2 made it popular			1
but , because of the way they bend light , current designs have always tended to draw more attention to the object than they deflect			1
now , a @entity11 researcher claims to have overcome this problem by integrating battery - powered devices into his design - and he claims an invisibility cloak will be created in his lifetime			1
but , because of the way they bend light , current designs have always tended to draw more attention to the object than they deflect @entity30 , a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the @entity31 the technology could soon be used to conceal military airplanes and even people			1
his @entity11 @entity36 - funded research is based on the use of porous plastic bowling balls and tiny copper wire circuit boards			2
these objects are put together in precise geometrical patterns to bend waves of energy in unnatural ways			2
in particular , they reveal a property called ' negative refraction ' , meaning they can bend a wave backwards			0
courtesy of @entity51 metamaterials are synthetic materials engineered to have properties that have not yet been found in nature through a prism with negative refraction , a straw leaning in a glass of water would appear inverted			2
the quest for a true invisibility cloak , seen in films such as @entity2 , is the holy grail for physicists			1
but while many have claimed to be able able to briefly conceal objects from view , and even shield sounds , one team has developed a way to cloak entire events			2
the say they managed to do this by concealing these events behind strands of laser light			0
the technique , called ‘ temporal cloaking ’ was developed at the @entity79 in @entity80 using lasers and fibre optics			2
the researchers separated strands of frequencies in laser light before changing their respective height			0
they then sent this light through a fibre optic cable			0
by slowing the speed of photons on a particular strand , the intensity of the light was dropped to zero			0
this made that particular strand appear invisible , hidden behind or between other strands			0
using this method , the light travelling in front of this strand was sped up , while the trailing part was slowed down to create a gap			0
the physicists then used this gap to insert hidden messages in data			0
during test , the hidden messages travelled along with the other frequencies , but arrived at the other end marginally out of sync with the photons surrounding it			0
it is called a spacetime cloak because the data is transported in a ' bubble of time			2
' the piece above the water 's surface would appear below the water and leaning in the opposite direction			0
in a more futuristic scenario , a person looking at a person wearing a cloak with artificially designed refraction properties would see part or none of the person			2
this would , however , depend on the cloak 's refractive index and whether the light bouncing off of it reached the viewer 's eye			0
but metamaterials with this negative refraction have presented a vexing physics problem : they reduce the strength of the wave			0
' one of the biggest problems with metamaterials is that they produce energy loss , ' professor @entity30 said			1
' the waves decay as they pass through the artificial material			1
we have designed a metamaterial that retains negative refraction but does not diminish energy			0
' in fact , the synthetic material not only prevented energy loss - it caused energy gain , with the microwave intensifying in strength as it passed through the material			1
professor @entity30 achieved this by embedding battery - powered tunnel diodes – which is a type of semiconductor device - and into the new material			1
' many people did not think it was possible to achieve energy gain along with negative refraction , ' professor @entity30 said			1
he first showed it was possible , with one - dimensional metamaterials , in a paper published in @entity172 in 2011			0
his new findings , reported in @entity174 , have broader implications , because they involve 3d metamaterials			0
professor @entity30 said it will be years before fantastical applications like a @entity2 - style invisibility cloaks would appear on the market			1
but he says his research is inherently practical , predicting : ' invisibility cloaks will be a reality in my lifetime			1

current invisibility cloaks often tend to draw more attention to object
this is because waves decay as they pass through artificial material
new technique uses battery - powered tunnel diodes to boost the power
technique works on @entity206 artificial materials rather than just plain sheets
' an invisibility cloak will be a reality in my lifetime , ' said professor @entity30
