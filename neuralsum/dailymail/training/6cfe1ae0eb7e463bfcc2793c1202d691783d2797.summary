it follows high profile historical cases involving celebrities such as @entity30 and revelations about sex gangs in @entity33 and @entity34			1
@entity35 , director of @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , told @entity38 last month that this type of abuse is ' in every town ' and warned that people retreated to a ' comfort zone ' of thinking grooming and abuse only happen ' elsewhere '			2
challenged about the remarks , @entity8 minister @entity17 insisted the risk of child abuse and grooming was not limited to certain areas			1
' we know that child sexual abuse and exploitation are not confined to any particular areas of the country , ' she said in response to a parliamentary question			1
' it can take on many different forms			0
' revealing the sharp rise in sexual grooming offences recorded by the police in @entity62 and @entity63 of 32 per cent , ms @entity17 added : ' this government is absolutely determined that every case of child sexual abuse or exploitation is fully investigated and all perpetrators prosecuted , we will do nothing to jeopardise those aims			1
' today the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) is holding a high - level summit to examine what more can be done to tackle historic weaknesses in councils in dealing with child abuse			1
@entity77 , chairman of the @entity71 's children and young people board , said : ' keeping children safe is the most important thing that councils do , but we know we can not do it alone			0
' protecting children does not fall only to councils , but to the police , health services , schools and local groups			2
' but @entity94 mp @entity93 criticised the event , , claiming victims were being excluded from the platform at the @entity71 ' talking shop ' in @entity99			0
he said : ' there has been a shameful lack of support for the survivors of child abuse			2
i met with a constituent last week for example who was refused support by local mental health services			0
' it does n't appear that a single representative of survivors ' groups will actually be speaking at the meeting ... in @entity115 and unless they are members of the @entity71 it will cost them over £ 345 to even attend			0
' there has been a rise in reported cases of abuse following revelations about sex gangs in @entity33 and @entity34 ( pictured ) also today experts involved in the government 's troubled child sexual abuse inquiry will appear before mps			1
the inquiry set up by home secretary @entity129 has stalled following the resignations of the two people appointed to chair it and uncertainty about how it will be granted extra powers			2
two members of the inquiry panel and the body 's expert adviser professor @entity139 , who wrote the damning report on sexual exploitation in @entity33 , will appear before the home affairs select committee			1
@entity35 , director of @entity36 ( @entity37 ) , said child abuse and grooming is happening in every part of the country mrs may revealed in a letter last month that she was considering standing down the panel in favour of a royal commission or a new inquiry on statutory terms			1
as well as prof @entity139 , the @entity127 will hear from panel members @entity157 and professor @entity158 as part of their investigation into the inquiry , which is without a chairman following the resignations of @entity164 and dame @entity165 after each became entangled in allegations of conflict of interest			2
there has been a rise in reported cases of abuse following revelations about sex gangs in @entity33 and @entity34			1
but campaign groups and the police warned parents and officials not to assume the problem was restricted to some areas			0
@entity180 has warned of an increase in people using so - called ' legal highs ' to groom youngsters for sex and the crime was widespread across @entity187			0
a major problem for police and social services is that where teenagers have been groomed they are not even aware that they are being abused and often believe they are in a loving relationship			0
ms @entity35 said last month : ‘ it 's a global crime so the concept of it only happening in a section of the country is wrong , it 's across the whole country			0
this type of abuse is in every town			0
' she said one of the problems was that parents and other adults prefer to think that child sex abuse is not the sort of thing that happens where they live			2
' we are all in a much better comfort zone if we think this type of abuse happens elsewhere and its other people who are affected and it 's other people doing the crime , that there is another ring going on			0
' and it 's something that we need to try and change			0
' she said she knew of serious cases involving families in @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , the @entity229 and @entity230			0
she warned that it was wrong to think only children in major cities were at risk .			0
