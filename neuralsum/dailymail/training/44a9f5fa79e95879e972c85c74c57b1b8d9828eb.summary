@entity0 , fresh from clinching his second @entity4 title in @entity22 on sunday , is in no doubt former team - mate @entity3 should be snapped up by @entity1			1

@entity3 has hailed @entity0 ( above ) as ' a worthy winner ' after his recent @entity4 title triumph in @entity22 ' i guess it ( @entity1 ' situation ) just highlights how limited @entity4 is			1
there are only 18 or 20 seats			0
' but he ( @entity3 ) has proven time and again he is still a worthy competitor and a valuable asset for any team to have			1
' i 've known @entity1 for a long , long time and he is passionate about racing			2
' i 'm sure he 'll make the smart decision , and for me , building a team to target being champions you need to have star quality drivers			0

he is a lovely guy and a very straightforward individual , even if it does not always come across like that , and he has done a great job			0
