by @entity0 published : 17:06 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 22 march 2013 when my son @entity2 was small , he had a red anorak that he would not take off			1
he lived in it , slept in it , he even took his bath in it			0
that may sound cute , and mildly eccentric , but it was n’t			0
it was terrifying , for him , for his mother and for me			0
@entity2 found the world so bewildering that the idea of even unzipping his coat plunged him into screaming , head - battering panic			1
he can barely communicate , or understand other people , or predict even the basic consequences of his actions			1
a different world : @entity0 with his autistic son @entity2 who is wearing his beloved red coat that ’s hard for anyone who does n’t suffer from autism to imagine			1
the new @entity29 production of @entity30 , which opened last week at the @entity32 to ecstatic reviews , sets itself a colossal challenge : to do justice on stage to the often nightmarish world of autism			1
for parents and siblings , neighbours and teachers , autism is difficult to understand			1
but we should all at least try to do so , because an estimated half a million people in @entity47 alone are ‘ on the autistic spectrum ’ — though thankfully , not many are as severely affected as @entity2			1
the play is based on novelist @entity51 ’s award - winning book of the same name , published nine years ago			2
it tells the story of a 15 - year - old boy , @entity55 ( played on stage by @entity57 ) , who can solve complex mathematical puzzles in his head but is so socially incapable that he can not dress or feed himself properly			1
@entity51 never states explicitly that @entity55 is autistic , but he depicts many of the symptoms of one type of autism , @entity64 ’s syndrome , with clinical accuracy			1
unique : as a result of his autism , @entity2 , pictured as a toddler , struggles to communicate with other people and is unable to predict the consequences of his actions anyone who wants to understand the condition better should see this production			1
it ’s a gripping experience with plenty of unexpected laughs			0
a bit like bringing up a child with autism			2
it powerfully conveys how it actually feels to be one of those half - million with the condition			2
but do n’t take an autistic person with you : the lights and the noise of the production are shattering			0
when @entity55 is overwhelmed by confusing stimuli — crowds , chatter , laughter , physical contact with other people — the stage becomes ablaze with flashing diodes and thunderous , bass - heavy music			1
it makes you want to screw up your eyes and press your thumbs into your ears , the classic autistic response to over-stimulation			0
@entity109 ’s sensitively observed performance captures many of the details of autistic behaviour			2
he constantly twiddles the cords of his hoodie around his fingers , waggling his hands like a pianist limbering up for a concerto			0
that ’s something my son does whenever he is agitated			2
he once twiddled a fridge magnet ( in the shape of a capital q ) , so obsessively that it became stuck on his finger and had to be dislodged with cutters in @entity128			0
@entity2 sees other people as machines — as objects that he must learn to operate — and so he pushes , nudges , drags and steers them into position			1
he ca n’t explain what he wants us to do , so he must move us accordingly			0
playwright @entity137 ’s adaptation of @entity30 makes clear this tendency by using actors as props : @entity55 sits on them , rides on them , wipes his feet on them , even uses one as a cashpoint			1
mirror image : @entity0 recognises his son @entity2 's behaviour in that displayed on stage in @entity151 autism is nothing if not self - centred			1
for @entity55 , the only possible viewpoint on the world is his own			1
in one subtly observed exchange , a neighbour tells him : ‘ i do n’t want to see you at the moment			0
’ @entity55 obligingly turns his back			1
he ca n’t see her and so , according to his faultless logic , she ca n’t see him			0
in the same way , when @entity2 waves to us , he keeps the palm of his hand towards his face			1
after all , when we wave to him , he can see our palms , so it makes perfect sense for him to see the lines on his own hand when he waves back			0
because people with autism are typically indifferent to what others think , peer pressure is irrelevant			2
in the play , @entity55 loves playing with @entity181			1
he always has done and he feels no need to ‘ grow up ’			0
but for his parents , that never - ending childhood is embarrassing and exhausting			2
‘ it ’s like he ’s just a big baby , ’ his despairing dad shouts			0
even more draining are the obsessions of an autistic child , the endlessly repeated questions and monologues			0
@entity55 is ‘ highly verbal ’ — he can talk fluently , but his conversation gets stuck in ruts			1
he recites facts about astronomy for hours , and repeats cringingly awkward questions over and over			0
his dad is close to the end of his tether , but @entity55 is oblivious			1
there are heart - stopping moments ( at one point , the man next to me was leaning so far forward in suspense that he slid off his seat )			2
@entity55 is frightened of many things , but he has no instinct for real danger			1
my son is the same			2
he would step out into moving traffic without a qualm			0
after all , it has always stopped for him before , every time he ’s crossed the road			0
why should it ever be different ? and when @entity55 has a meltdown in a store , surrounded by outraged shoppers , i wanted to stand up and yell : ‘ oh , yes — been there ! ’ by the way , a plea to the general public : when a harassed parent is coping with an autistic meltdown , it ’s not helpful to shout : ‘ what that child needs is a damn good smack ! ’ the @entity231 is about more than autism ; it also offers a hard - eyed depiction of a relationship between a mother and father that has been ripped apart , piece by painful piece , under the strain of caring for a child with special needs			1
my wife @entity244 and i have been fortunate			0
our marriage has coped , perhaps because we have an older son who has been a dependable source of good humour and calm throughout it all			2
but caring for an autistic child 24 hours a day for years on end takes its toll : marriages and careers collapse , debts mount up , and stress - related illnesses and drink problems are common			2
the play tackles this side of dealing with autism without flinching			2
it also shows how bizarre family life can become when it is always contorted to accommodate the arbitrary needs of an autistic mind			0
@entity55 hates to be touched , so his father can never hug him			1
instead , they touch fingertips , like @entity271 and the little boy he befriends in @entity274 ’s film			0
anything can seem normal if it happens often enough			0
for years , my left arm was bruised because of @entity2 ’s helpful habit of prodding it with his foot from the back seat when it was time to use the indicator while driving : one tap with the toe to the elbow when turning left , one thwhack to the bicep for right			1
on stage : @entity57 in @entity30 at the @entity32 seems unthinkable , does n’t it ? but you do n’t just get used to these things , they become part of the fabric of your life			0
you might think @entity55 ’s father in the play ca n’t cope with his son for a moment longer — until you see him trying to cope without him			1
while the play gets a great deal right , not everything rings true			0
a promised saturday outing for @entity55 is cancelled because his dad wants to watch an @entity309 football game on the telly			1
this seemed to me utterly unrealistic			0
that sort of luxury , sadly , is an impossibility for single parents of autistic teenagers			0
in one sequence , @entity55 daydreams about the sensation of floating in space			1
it ’s beautifully staged but out of character			2
@entity323 , the mental power to see in the mind ’s eye something that has n’t happened , is absent in autism			2
there are some graver misunderstandings			0
i was saddened by the portrayal of @entity55 ’s head teacher as a lazy , spiteful jobsworth			1
@entity335 knows that parents with disabled children have to deal with various incompetent and obstructive officials , but in my experience , the great majority of special needs teachers are dedicated and inspiring individuals			0
@entity2 is nearly 17 now , and he ’s had many teachers			1
energy , determination and selflessness have been hallmarks of all of them			0
it ’s a pity , too , that @entity55 had to be portrayed with a special talent : an outstanding gift for maths			1
this gift gives momentum to the story , of course , and it provides a theme for the staging ( the set is lined like graph - paper and @entity55 draws on it in chalk , the way @entity362 used to scrawl on blackboards )			1
i ’ve known plenty of autistic children but never one with a superpower — or , at least , not a useful one			0
my son @entity2 has the uncanny ability to identify any @entity371 video cassette without looking at it , simply by picking it up and rattling it when it ’s been removed from its case			1
i do n’t just mean that he can tell @entity376 apart from @entity377 with his eyes closed			0
i mean that at 4am , in a pitch - black room with 500 videos piled on the floor , he can locate that one copy of @entity376 that he ’s looking for by the rattle alone			2
it ’s not quite a superpower , but it is a remarkable talent and unique to my beloved , exhausting and eternally curious son			2
i wish i knew how .			0
