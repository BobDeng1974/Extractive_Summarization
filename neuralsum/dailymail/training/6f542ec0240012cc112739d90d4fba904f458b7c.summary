bad drivers and illegal parkers – consider yourselves warned			0
the online community is taking a stand against dangerous and stupid motorists , using @entity6 to name and shame the culprits			2
it ’s hoped that by identifying those responsible of reckless driving , the public humiliation will stop them from re-offending , or persuade them to be more considerate			0
a @entity16 facebook page is the latest to join the campaign , showcasing some of the worst human hazards on @entity20 roads			0
this is a park , right ? a driver is incapable of distinguishing the difference between the road ( good for parking ) and the curb ( bad for parking ) good luck everybody else ! a car blatantly parks another car in , with its tail end in the @entity33 if parking in a disabled parking space without a permit was n't bad enough , this car chose to park in the lane horizontally			2
it 's unknown who was in the wrong in this sticky situation , but it 's clear that it all ended wrong , with the sedan sandwiched between the curb and a truck in august , @entity49 reported about the @entity51 ' @entity50 , posting photos of hundreds of fully - capable motorists parking in disabled parking spaces			1
the phenomenon has continued , with the @entity56 gaining more than 8000 likes in just five days , with @entity6 users uploading shocking photographs of stupid motorist behaviour			1
the number plate and any identifying features are always published to ensure maximum embarrassment			0
the facebook page makes it clear that driving a flash car , does n't mean the person can drive at all it appears this car space was n't spacious enough for ' @entity70 ' , with the tail end of the car taking up half of the space behind			0
although @entity70 did n't have time to correct his park , he could put up his foil car sunshade this fancy pants corvette does n't follow the rules ! this park speaks for itself - irritating and obnoxious commenters thrill in guffawing at the outrageous photographs and videos – which include a driver taking up four parking spots , drivers parked diagonally across disabled parking space and even a motorist on the wrong side of the road			1
but some examples of terrible driving are n’t just inconvenient or ridiculous – some submissions to the website show shocking moments that put the lives of the driver and all other motorists in mortal danger			0
helmet camera footage from a motorbike rider shows a car driving onto the wrong side of the road to try and overtake another car , when a car turns the corner , narrowly avoiding a head on collision			0
this driver ' kind of ' parked in a disabled parking space			1
but he also ' kind of ' parked on the pavement , so maybe that 's okay somehow , four car spaces seems a little ... the car owner will have plenty of new enemies by the time they return to their car not only is this a terrible park , this @entity6 user indicates that there were nine worse parks before it hopefully the driver on the right was n't hoping to go anywhere in a hurry , with the driver of the car on the left somehow thinking this was an acceptable park another video from a dashboard camera shows a truck changing lanes , seemingly oblivious to a vehicle in its path , forcing the car to hastily veer off the road			1
the site ’s administrator , @entity142 ( surname withheld ) says he has been blown away by the number of outrageous incidents that have been published on the @entity6 page and hopes the @entity6 page can change people ’s behaviour on the roads			1
' @entity152 ' is parked in the middle of the footpath , with absolutely no consideration to pedestrians note to self : remember the handbrake ! the plumber driving this van was not having a good morning the mind boggles : let 's just assume this driver had had enough of driving for one day when they left their car in this ridiculous position ‘ as both a cyclist and motorist , i am concerned to see how many people take chances on the road , ( such as ) cyclists being knocked off by cars ( and ) crazy driving in rush hour traffic to gain a couple of spaces in front , ’ @entity142 told @entity167 ‘ if putting this online will help slow some people down , or stop them running a red light , or make them more aware of others - then it 's job done really			0
’ a @entity16 police spokeswoman said police could investigate serious roading incidents on social media , but typically needed to receive a complaint and evidence from someone , according to stuff.co.nz			1
not one but two disabled parking spots : the epitomy of at least if this driver was going to be a bad driver , they decided to be very good at that innovative parking : this car decides to create its own car space in close proximity to the shops			2

a new @entity6 page in @entity16 names and shames terrible drivers
in five days the group has more than 8000 likes and has been *inundated* with photos and videos of shocking drivers
joins growing social media trend which identifies *irresponsible* motorists
hopes the drivers will be *ashamed* and be more *thoughtful*
an @entity51 page published photographs of motorists parked illegally in disabled parking spaces
