by @entity0 it may not be the most glamorous of archaeological finds , but the discovery of 700 - year - old stinking toilets has got experts excited			2
human excrement described as being in ‘ excellent condition ’ has been found at the 14th century site , which features a number of special purpose - built barrel latrines			1
amazingly , the medieval faeces inside them still smell pungent , despite having had centuries to mellow			2
@entity14 : human excrement described as being in ' excellent condition ' has been found at the 14th century site , which features a number of specially - purposed barrels used as toilets the 700 - year - old barrels were used as lavatories but were previously used to transport goods and store fish			1
the names of their owners , before they were transformed into makeshift toilets , can also be seen on them			2
three barrels were stacked on top of one another to form a well			0
they were tied together and lined with clay , as well as having pipes at the bottom of them			0
it is not yet known whether the two toilets were attached to a house or acted as a public lavatory			0
it is hoped that the excrement will give scientists a better idea of what people ate in @entity46 at the time and it is now being analysed by experts			1
the waste was found on an archaeological dig at @entity52 square in @entity53 on the island of @entity55 , according to @entity56			0
markings on the wooden barrels , one of which is pictured , include the owner 's details and reveal that some of them were used to transport goods , as well as store fish archaeologists also found three barrels ( pictured ) stacked on top of one another that are thought to have been used as a basic well the find is especially useful to experts as the barrels were used for a different purpose before they were transformed into toilets			1
