exploring the @entity0 usually involves a map , walking boots – and a lot of stamina			0
but , thanks to @entity7 , even the laziest among us could soon become the most intrepid of travellers – and all without leaving the comfort of our sofa			1
the internet giant is using its @entity14 cameras – mounted for the first time in a backpack – to showcase the @entity19 attraction ’s most popular hiking trails			1
@entity7 is using a nearly 40lb , backpack - sized camera unit to showcase the canyon 's most popular trails @entity7 and its street - view cameras already have taken users to narrow cobblestone alleys in @entity36 using a tricycle , inside the @entity38 with a push cart and to @entity41 's snow - covered slopes by snowmobile			1
now they have mounted street - view onto a backpack to showcase the @entity0 's most popular hiking trails			1
on monday it mapped the ten - mile @entity47 along the @entity49 canyon ’s @entity0			0
each 40lb backpack contains 15 five - megapixel cameras , which are positioned to give a 360 - degree view , an on - board hard drive , and enough battery to run for a day			1
the images will then be stitched together and should be available in a few months			0
it 's the latest evolution in mapping technology for the company , which has used a rosette of cameras to photograph thousands of cities and towns in dozens of countries for its @entity14 feature			1
with a click of the mouse , @entity66 users are transported virtually for a 360 - degree view of locales they may have read about only in tourist books and seen in flat , 2d images			0
' any of these sort of iconic , cultural , historical locations that are not accessible by road is where we want to go , ' said @entity78 , product manager at @entity7			2
@entity7 announced the trekker earlier this year but made its first official collection of data this week at the @entity0 , with mr @entity82 among the first to use the device			1
technical : @entity7 product manager @entity78 works with the trekker along the @entity47 the camera worn by @entity22 captures images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels each after a nearly 10 - mile trek going from 6,900ft in elevation to 2,400ft , he hiked back up from @entity90 , which can be 30 degrees warmer than at the rim , through the @entity93 and also gathered data on other trails			1
the so - called trekker captures images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels each , from the rest areas , the steep switchbacks , the change from juniper trees to scrub brush and the traffic that moves aside as a courtesy to mule riders			1
the gps data is limited , so @entity7 must compensate with sensors that record temperature , vibrations and the orientation of the device as it changes , before it stiches the images together and makes them available to users in a few months , mr @entity78 said			2
the backpacks are n't ready for volunteer use , but @entity7 has said it wants to deploy them at national forests , to the narrow streets of @entity121 , @entity122 and to ancient ruins and castles			2
' it 's going to be hard to beat this ' : mr @entity22 only vaguely alluded to the rival service recently launched by @entity127 , which has dropped @entity14 from it 's @entity129 range useful : one @entity0 visitor said being able to view the terrain ahead of time , gauge the difficulty of the hike and know just how wide the path is would benefit those considering a trip the move to capture the @entity0 comes after @entity127 chose to drop @entity139 from its mobile operating systems and opted to use its own mapping program that was derided for , among other things , poor directions and missing towns			0
@entity22 , operations manager for @entity7 , did n't directly address the competition , but nevertheless told the @entity146 : ' it 's going to be hard to beat this			1
' @entity7 announced the @entity25 this summer but this week 's trip to the @entity0 marked its first official collection of data using the device			1
the backpack - mounted device , pictured right , captures images every 2.5 seconds with 15 cameras that are 5 megapixels each			1
around the @entity0 , gps data is limited , so @entity7 must compensate with sensors that record temperature , vibrations and the orientation of the device as it changes a removable hard drive on the trekker stores the data gathered			2
images will then be stitched together and made available to users in a few months the backpacks are n't ready for volunteer use , but @entity7 has said it wants to deploy them at national forests , to the narrow streets of @entity121 , @entity122 and to ancient ruins and castles			2
' you ’ve seen our cars , trikes , snowmobiles and trolleys — but wheels only get you so far			0
there ’s a whole wilderness out there that is only accessible by foot , ' @entity7 said in june			2
' @entity25 solves that problem by enabling us to photograph beautiful places such as the @entity0 so anyone can explore them			2
' all the equipment fits in this one backpack , and we ’ve already taken it out on the slopes			0
' @entity7 launched its @entity14 feature in 2007 and has expanded from five @entity19 cities to more than 3,000 locales in 43 countries			2
teams and volunteers have covered more than 5million miles with the @entity14 vehicles on a scale that other companies have n't approached , said @entity199 , president of @entity200 , a company that monitors mapping efforts			0
' you could safely say that it 's a standout , well - used application and they do n't really have any competition , ' he said			0
hikers that were on the @entity0 trails when the data was gathered will have their faces blurred - an attempt by @entity7 to ensure privacy			1
the company came in for fierce criticism in @entity216 and @entity217 after it emerged that it had scooped up and stored information transmitted over unsecured wireless networks while capturing images for @entity14			0
a removable hard drive on the trekker stores the data gathered at the @entity0			0
tourists looked at the trekker strangely this week , as if it was something from outer space			0
@entity228 , a first - time visitor from @entity229 , @entity230 , said being able to view the terrain ahead of time , gauge the difficulty of the hike and know just how wide the path is would benefit those considering a trip to the @entity0			0
she and a group of friends headed down the same path as @entity82 but on mules , not foot			0
' i think it 's an excellent idea to give people a broader perspective on what they 're getting into , ' she said			0
what the images wo n't tell visitors is how much water they should carry down the trails , how to prepare for temperature changes , what type of food to bring and how much , and how best to protect the natural resources , park spokeswoman @entity247 said			0
' stitched together with other information out there , the technology could be valuable , ' she said			0
