a petition is urging @entity3 airline @entity1 to stop ultra-orthodox @entity6 passengers ' bullying , intimidating and discriminating against women '			1
the petition , which at the time of writing has 1,500 signatures , comes after passengers aboard an @entity1 flight from @entity15 's @entity14 to @entity3 recently caused a delay after hundreds of @entity17 demanded that other passengers trade places before takeoff , saying they can not sit next to women			1
it 's been organised by @entity23 from @entity24 , who wrote : ' if a passenger was being verbally or physically abusive to airline staff , they would immediately be removed from the plane			0
a petition is urging @entity3 airline @entity1 to stop @entity32 passengers ' bullying , intimidating and discriminating against women ' ' if a passenger was flouting the rules for take - off , thereby causing flight delay , they would immediately be removed from the plane			1
' if a passenger was openly engaging in racial or religious discrimination against another passenger or flight attendant , they would immediately be removed from the plane			1
' why then , does @entity1 allow gender discrimination against women ? why does @entity1 permit female passengers to be bullied , harassed , and intimidated into switching seats which they rightfully paid for and were assigned to by @entity1 ? one person 's religious rights do not trump another person 's civil rights			1
' recently , passengers aboard an @entity1 flight from @entity15 's @entity14 to @entity3 caused a delay after hundreds of @entity17 demanded that other passengers trade places before takeoff @entity17 @entity6 are a stream of @entity57 characterized by their rejection of mainstream secular culture			1
@entity17 regard themselves as the most religiously authentic group of @entity6 and although this claim is contested by other streams of @entity64 , it is a perception which is often held in wider @entity6 and @entity67 society			2
the disrupted flight from @entity15 to @entity14 was transporting @entity3 and @entity6 passengers , including some @entity17 , to the @entity70 in time for the start of the @entity72			1
however , many of the male @entity6 refused to sit next to other female passengers prior to the takeoff			1
the tactic not only delayed the flight , but also went onto cause chaos on board			2
' people stood in the aisles and refused to go forward , ' said @entity82 , a passenger who was on board the plane			0
' although everyone had tickets with seat numbers that they purchased in advance , they asked us to trade seats with them , and even offered to pay money , since they can not sit next to a woman			0
it was obvious that the plane would n't take off as long as they keep standing in the aisles			0
' passengers claimed that despite the @entity1 flight crew informing travelers that they did not have to agree to switch , the plane 's captain announced the flight would not be going anywhere until everyone was seated			1
' it was an 11 - hour long nightmare , ' one of the passengers said			0
@entity112 , another traveler on the flight , said the ultra-orthodox passengers suggested she and her spouse split up to better accommodate their desired seating arrangements : ' why should i agree to switch places ? ' she said with anger to @entity120			2
after she refused , the @entity17 man known as a @entity17 ended up swapping with her after he continued to stand in the aisle as soon as the plane had taken off			0
@entity17 regard themselves as the most authentic custodians of jewish religious law and tradition which , in their opinion , is binding and unchangeable			0
they consider all other expressions of @entity64 , including @entity132 , as deviations from @entity135 's laws many passengers have reported that after takeoff a large portion of the travelers took to the aisles to pray which causing them to become crowded and flight attendants unable to serve drinks or distribute meals			0
@entity1 has responded to the claims and promised to look into the issue			2
it said : ' @entity1 does everything it can to give its passengers the best possible service year - round			2
our crews on the ground and in the air are doing the best they can to address the needs and requests of all our travelers while trying not to fall behind schedule ' the company will examine the complaints and if some passengers are found to have acted out of line we will examine its future steps			0
' ms @entity23 believes pre-booked segregation is the answer			0
she said : ' if @entity1 wants to truly accommodate all of its passengers , it will reserve a few rows of separate sex seating on every flight , where for a fee , those passengers who need such seating can pre-book their seats and not annoy or coerce other passengers before take - off to change seats with them - thereby avoiding arguments , bullying , and delayed take - off			1
