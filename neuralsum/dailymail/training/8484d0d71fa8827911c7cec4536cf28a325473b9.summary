while we eat vegetables and fish , all slathered in olive oil , hoping to benefit from the healthy @entity9 diet , the @entity1 way of life is attracting the attention of research scientists studying health and longevity			1
those who live on the @entity16 islands have the longest life expectancy , at 82.5 years compared to our 80 , and the highest proportion of centenarians , including @entity20 , 116 , perhaps the oldest person in the world			1
their obesity rate is just 3.5 per cent , compared to a quarter of @entity23			2
rates of breast cancer , prostate cancer and heart disease in @entity1 are also much lower than those in the @entity23			1
here , experts reveal the @entity1 habits that can help you live to 100 ... chop it up : give your lifestyle an @entity35 twist by following the @entity1 way @entity37 the healthy habit ‘ in @entity1 people tend to finish off meals with green tea or fruit rather than a pudding , ’ says dr @entity39			1
‘ dessert is something to be taken with coffee in the afternoon , if at all , and the portions are much smaller than in the @entity49			2
’ the theory increasing evidence has linked sugar to weight gain , and related diseases such as diabetes , heart disease and high blood pressure			1
the evidence @entity1 people consume on average 48.8g sugar per day , compared with the @entity23 who get through 100.4g a day , according to recent statistics from the @entity62 of the @entity63			1
@entity64 for @entity65 the healthy habit experts link @entity1 health and longevity to a diet low in fat and high in fruit and sea vegetables such as seaweed			1
the theory @entity65 is packed with disease - fighting antioxidants and can help you to lose weight			1
the evidence in march , scientists at @entity78 reported that alginate , a compound found in seaweed , stops the body absorbing fat			2
their study showed that a fourfold increase in intake of alginate boosted suppression of fat digestion by 75 per cent			2
live like the japanese if you want to try seaweed , buy wakame flakes , available at health - food stores , soak in water for five minutes and add to salads			1
eating habits : by practicing ' hara hachi bu ' - stop when you are 80 per cent full - and eating sushi , which has omega 3 rich fish and sea vegetables such as seaweed , you could lengthen your life @entity104 the healthy habit the remote @entity1 island of @entity107 has the highest proportion of centenarians in the world , and some credit this to the practice of ‘ hara hachi bu ’ – eat until you ’re eight - tenths full			1
the theory if you stop before you ’re full , and wait , you ’ll find you do n’t need those last few mouthfuls after all , so you ’ll eat less , staying slim and healthy			2
the evidence this theory is based on the delay between the stomach becoming full and the brain receiving this signal , which experts agree takes 20 minutes – which means many of us , by eating too quickly , end up having more than we need			2
while the @entity23 love ‘ a clean plate ’ , evidence shows calorie restriction helps to maintain a healthy weight , and protect against diseases such as heart disease and cancer			1
a 20 - year study on monkeys showed that those whose calorie intake was restricted by 30 per cent had longer life spans and showed slower ageing of the brain			1
live like the japanese have dainty portion sizes and you ’ll be less likely to overeat , says @entity140 , author of @entity141			2
‘ the @entity1 daily calorie intake is ten per cent less than in the @entity23			1
that ’s because the food pattern is more filling , and food is served on much smaller plates			0
’ @entity148 ( but hold the @entity149 ) the @entity150 is a good source of omega 3 fatty acids , important for brain and heart health			2
the @entity1 eat 80g to 100g of fish every day , while the @entity23 struggle to eat one portion of oily fish a week			1
the theory ‘ sushi is a great source of @entity163 fatty acids , and it ’s also a healthy way to eat protein because you ’re not accompanying it with saturated fat as you do in a @entity170 diet , ’ says dr @entity39 of the @entity160			0
the @entity171 has found that @entity1 ’s low rate of heart disease was down to their enjoyment of fish and seafood			1
@entity1 men had less cholesterol in their arteries than @entity181 men , even though they had similar blood - pressure readings and higher rates of smoking			1
a high fish diet may have a protective effect against artery - clogging			0
live like the japanese have sushi or oily fish at least once a week , but dr @entity39 warns not to cover it in soy sauce , or it becomes very high in salt			2
traditional movement : by walking to work and practicing @entity197 , the @entity1 people improve fitness and psychological well -- being walk to work the healthy habit driving is expensive in @entity1 , so many people rely on public transport and walking			1
‘ one of the biggest health secrets of the @entity1 lifestyle is walking , ’ says @entity140			1
‘ people walk two or three times per day on average , and spend radically less time in cars			0
’ the theory going places on foot results in a daily dose of at least 30 to 60 minutes of routine , incidental exercise , which gives a very powerful health boost			0
the evidence walking for two - and - a - half hours a week could add seven years to your life , @entity217 researchers reported in 2012			2
they reviewed six long - term studies and found that even 75 minutes of brisk walking could extend life by almost two years			2
@entity224 walking into your daily routine and think about whether you really need to drive , says @entity140			0
‘ most people can find a way to briskly walk for 30 minutes a day			0
’ balance your life the healthy habit it ’s common to see groups of adults practising tai chi in parks in @entity1			1
the ancient @entity236 martial art combines deep breathing and very slow , graceful movements			0
the theory @entity197 is considered a good form of exercise for older people because of the minimal impact on the joints			0
it ’s also thought to be good for improving balance and mobility and reducing stress			0
the @entity249 2011 study reviewed a number of studies on tai chi and concluded that the practice can prevent falls by improving balance , and that it is also good for psychological wellbeing			0
live like the japanese @entity197 is suitable for everyone			2

@entity265 know the score : @entity1 are required to have annual health checks the healthy habit for centuries , the @entity1 have been eating fermented or pickled vegetables			1
the theory the vegetables are pre-digested by bacteria , which make their nutrients easier for the body to absorb , and stimulate the growth of ‘ good ’ bacteria in the gut			0
the @entity171 shows this healthy gut bacteria is linked to the immune system – 80 per cent of our immune cells are in the gut			0
fermented vegetables provide a rich source of lactic acid bacteria which are thought to be the most useful for gut health			0
@entity287 shows suguki , a pickled turnip , could protect against flu			0
miso is also made from fermented soy beans			0
@entity293 the healthy habit amazingly , there is no word for ‘ hot flushes ’ in @entity1 and studies show that women there suffer much less during the menopause than women in the @entity49			1
why ? some experts suggest it ’s down to their high intake of soy beans and soy foods , such as tofu			0
the @entity310 foods contain isoflavones , which mimic the effect of oestrogen , the hormone that naturally falls in women in middle age			0
the evidence in 2012 , a major review on the subject found that two daily servings of soy can reduce the frequency and severity of hot flushes by 26 per cent , compared with a placebo			0
the paper , published in @entity327 : the @entity328 , reviewed 19 previous studies which looked at a total of 1,200 women			0
@entity332 , a medical anthropologist at the @entity333 and co-author of the study , said the effect is probably greater in @entity1 women who have eaten soy products from birth			1
‘ but if you ’re 50 and you ’ve never touched soy , it ’s not too late , ’ she added			0
‘ we ’ve found that it still helps			0
’ live like the @entity1 ‘ in @entity1 they have tofu a couple of times a week , ’ says nutritionist @entity346			1
‘ it ’s best to get soy beans in this fermented form rather than a soya burger , as it ’s much more easily digested			0
’ try tofu in stir fries or @entity16 broths and stews			0
know your numbers the @entity360 in @entity1 is strongly encouraged to attend a free annual health check			1
employers are charged with ensuring that their workers do not gain weight			0
the @entity366 dr @entity39 says @entity1 people are encouraged to be health - conscious , to eat well , take regular exercise and listen to the body			1
‘ there ’s a sense of responsibility to take care of yourself as you get older – you do n’t want to be a nuisance so you stay healthy			0
’ the evidence a study in @entity377 concluded that a major reason for @entity1 ’s excellent life expectancy was heavy government investment in the public healthcare system , free annual health checks , and a sense of health - consciousness among its citizens			1
increasingly , doctors are stressing that changes in lifestyles are the key to reducing disease , death and the strain on the @entity393			2
live like the japanese although there are no free health check - ups in the @entity23 , that does n’t mean you ca n’t pay attention to your health and diet and keep a healthy weight .			2

@entity1 live longer and are less likely to get cancer and heart disease
the @entity1 ' way of life ' is could lead you to a healthier lifestyle
