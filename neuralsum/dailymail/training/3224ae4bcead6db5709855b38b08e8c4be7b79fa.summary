by @entity0 published : 11:22 est , 14 may 2013 updated : 11:35 est , 14 may 2013 an elderly woman became emaciated as a result of neglect while being looked after by carers , a serious case review has revealed			2
@entity6 , who required care for 22 years after suffering a stroke , was found to be starving when she died at the age of 70			1
her weight at the time of her death prompted fears that she was neglected by carers			2
at one point @entity15 was left alone at home , bedridden , and with no way to call for help while her husband was rushed to hospital the report found that the pensioner was subjected to poor care which left her underweight and covered in bed sores , with scaly skin and matted , falling out hair			1
the review into her death also revealed that her carers watched tv and talked on their phones while visiting her at her home in @entity34 , @entity35			1
despite mrs @entity6 's worryingly low weight being noted in 2007 , nothing was done about it until she was moved into a care home five years later			1
at the time , care managers noted : ‘ her state of personal hygiene is such that we would not have expected to find in a person with such a comprehensive care package			2
’ days before she was moved into the care home , mrs @entity6 had been left alone , bedridden and unable to call for help , after ambulance staff rushed her husband to hospital after he also suffered a stroke			1
three weeks later a dietician reported she was ' very malnourished and emaciated ' , adding : ‘ her condition raises concerns of neglect by whoever was caring for her			2
’ mrs @entity6 's husband , @entity57 , branded the care ' awful '			1
he said : ‘ i was having to feed her when she did n't want to eat and lift her on and off the commode more than 20 to 30 times a day			0
‘ i have no qualms with social services , but when the other carers came sometimes they just watched tv or were on their phones , they never helped me feed her or roll her over			1
mrs @entity6 was found to be seriously underweight , covered in bed sores and with scaly skin and matted hair			1
she was also ' very malnourished '			0
at one point she was left alone , bedridden and unable to call for help when her husband was rushed to hospital			1
nine agencies , including @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 , have been criticised by the serious case review into her death			0
‘ they only came for half an hour in the morning , and then quarter of an hour at teatime and bedtime			0
‘ during this time she got bed sores , was n't eating right , her hair was never washed			1
i felt so isolated and could n't cope			0
’ the report found the authorities had not carried out assessments of mrs @entity6 after she suffered a stroke in 1990 and that they also failed to carry out assessments after a second stroke in 2005			1
it criticised failures in ' effective multiagency working ' and said no effort was made to establish a relationship with mrs @entity6			2
it noted : ‘ one of the evident flaws was that a lack of clarity existed even within individual agencies about role and responsibility			0
’ it highlighted ' individual poor basic practice ... despite the involvement of a wide range of professionals ' leading up to her death in may 2012			0
the report listed a ' number of failings ' by nine agencies in @entity35 including the @entity117 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and the local authority			0
two members of staff at @entity121 have been sacked in the wake of the report			0
@entity124 , @entity78 's head of specialist adult services , promised lessons will be learned from the case			0
he said : ‘ in hindsight , staff involved should have challenged those decisions and probed deeper to see if mrs @entity6 was getting the care she should have			2
‘ when she was moved to a home it was obvious something had gone wrong , she was frail , thin and her body weight was not what it should have been			0
’ @entity137 , director of nursing and innovation at @entity139 , added : ‘ we are committed to working with partner agencies across @entity35 to act on the lessons learnt and prevent this from happening again			0
