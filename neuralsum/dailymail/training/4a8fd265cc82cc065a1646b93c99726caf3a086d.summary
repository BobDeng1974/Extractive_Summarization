the number of babies born last year was the highest in more than 40 years , according to official figures			1
there were nearly 724,000 newborn children in @entity5 and @entity6 , the greatest number since 1971 , at the tail end of the 1960s baby boom			1
a key reason for the rising numbers of babies is the large - scale immigration of the past decade , which has brought in mainly young men and women ready to have families			0
baby boom : the number of babies born in @entity20 in 2012 was the highest for 40 years , new figures reveal newly - arrived migrants also tend to have higher birth - rates than people in the existing population			1
the impact of immigration on childbirth was underlined by another rise in the number of babies born to women who were themselves born abroad			1
impact : the increase was partly fuelled by a high number of babies born to mothers who were themselves born abroad the share of babies born to immigrant mothers went up again , to 25.9 per cent , well over a quarter of all births			1
another factor pushing up birthrates was the growing trend for women of 40 and older to have children			0
numbers of babies born to 40 - somethings are now running at five times the level of the mid- 1970s and reached almost 30,000 last year			1
the leap in 40 - plus - year - olds having families is a result of large numbers of women delaying having families because of education , careers , mortgages and their own unstable relationships , and then trying to catch up as they reach the end of their childbearing years			2
the figures released by the @entity62 show the 724,674 babies were born in @entity5 and @entity6 in 2012 , 0.8 per cent more than in 2011			1
for @entity20 as a whole , the increase was slightly less , a 0.6 per cent rise to 812,970			0
the lesser increase across the @entity20 was a result of falling numbers of births in @entity71			0
a report by the @entity62 said there was no single reason for the increase , but pointed to a rise in childbirth among women in their late 20s , and ‘ increases in the numbers of foreign - born women who tend to have higher fertility than @entity20 - born women ’			0
it also said there is a possibility of ‘ government policy and the economic climate indirectly influencing individuals ’ decisions around childbearing			0
’ sir @entity93 of the @entity95 think tank said that the figures showed how immigration is pushing up population and stretching public services			0
new data shows there has been a marked increase in the number of births in the paste decade the number of women in their 40s having babies has increased fivefold since the 1970s ‘ if anyone wonders why our maternity wards are under such pressure , this is the answer , ’ he said			2
‘ the official projections show that just over two thirds of our population increase is a result of immigration			0
part of this is new arrivals make a contribution to birthrates , as these figures show			0
’ numbers of births in @entity5 and @entity6 were last higher than in 2012 in 1971 , when 783,155 children were born in @entity5 and @entity6			1
at the time birthrates were going down sharply following the peak of the baby boom in 1964			2
the lowest number of childbirths in any year since @entity135 came in 1977 , when there were 569,259 births			2
in 2001 there were just under 600,000 children born in @entity5 and @entity6			1
subsequent years have seen birth numbers rising along with immigration that has added three million people to the population .			0
