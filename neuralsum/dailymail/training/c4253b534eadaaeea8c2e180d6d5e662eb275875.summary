by @entity0 published : 12:44 est , 4 december 2012 updated : 12:44 est , 4 december 2012 after a gun accident took off half his face , @entity1 spent 15 years living as a recluse			1
horribly disfigured , he hid indoors			2
when he ventured out , it was behind a baseball cap and surgical mask			2
he did n’t pursue a career and never married			0
now , seven months after undergoing the most extensive face transplant in history , 37 - year - old @entity1 is finally coming out of hiding			1
thanks to a combination of potent medications and dogged determination , @entity1 is healing faster than anyone expected , according to his doctors at the @entity19 , where his transplant was performed			1
' you have to carry the ball			0
' mr @entity1 , @entity40 says , took the ball and ran with it			1
by the time @entity1 , from @entity46 , @entity32 , was selected as a transplant candidate in 2005 , he had already undergone more than a dozen operations attempting to give him functional use of his mouth			1
despite the numerous surgeries , certain facial features - such as his lips , nose and the front of his tongue - were beyond repair			1
handsome : how mr @entity1 looked prior to his devastating gun accident in 1997 ' after several attempts at reconstruction , it became apparent it was n’t going to work , ' @entity1 , who declined to be interviewed in person , said in a written statement			1
' the face transplant was one of my very few options left			0
' the 36 - hour operation was completed in march and involved more than 150 doctors , nurses and @entity19 staff members			1
' everything from the scalp to the mid-line of my neck was replaced , including the jaw bones , teeth , part of my tongue , muscles , and nerves ' said @entity1 , who has retained his eyesight through the gun accident and the subsequent surgeries			1
the days immediately following the transplant were promising			0
@entity1 was taken off his postoperative ventilator , and within the first week he was able to shave his face and brush his teeth			1
when @entity1 saw his new face in a mirror for the first time , he wrote : ' the only thing i could do was hug dr. @entity40			1
' he spent the first two months following the surgery in the hospital			2
the goal at that time , @entity40 said , was to reduce inflammation and stymie the risk of rejection through high doses of immuno - suppressing drugs			2
in may , @entity1 was discharged but instructed to remain in the @entity106 area , where he could meet with his transplant team as well as a psychologist , a social worker , and speech and physical therapists multiple times each week			1
finally , @entity1 was allowed to return home to @entity46 , in southwest @entity32 , where he does his speech therapy ' homework ' and meets with his local physician			1
he returns to @entity106 once or twice a month for checkups with @entity40 and other doctors			2
watch video here : ' i have been doing very well regaining my speech back , ' @entity1 said			1
' each day it improves a little more			0
' there was , however , one hiccup in the recovery process : the much - feared rejection			2
as with any transplant , there was a possibility that @entity1 ’s body would reject his new face			1
in this case , the rejection was mild and treatable , @entity40 said			0
' when people hear '' rejection , '' they think , '' oh , my @entity135 , the face is going to melt off , '' ' @entity40 said			0
' that ’s not the case at all			0
the skin got a little bit swollen and there was a little bit of redness			0
on a scale of 1 to 10 , ” with 10 being the worst - case scenario , “ this was a grade 1 rejection			2
' still , @entity1 is not in the clear			1
he continues to run the risk of rejection and he will have to take medications for the rest of his life			0
rebuilding process : mr @entity1 's skull after his accident ( left ) and as surgeons began to piece it back together ( right ) remarkable : after a 36 - hour operation , doctors had reconstructed the lower half of mr @entity1 's face @entity40 said that one of the most common questions he is asked is : ' how is @entity1 dealing with having a new face ? ' dr @entity40 said : ' we always think that there is going to be a facial identity crisis			1
that ’s the worry of people with normal faces			0
we think how we ’d feel if this happened to us			0
' but for people with disfigurements — these people have lived lives concealed from society			0
that ’s a very different and difficult recovery			0
' before the transplant , @entity1 rarely left his home			1
in addition to wearing a surgical mask and baseball cap on his infrequent trips out in public , he did his shopping at night so he would n’t have to face the stares of as many people			1
' i am now able to walk past people and no one even gives me a second look , ' he wrote			0
after years of going out of his way to avoid people , @entity1 is surprisingly comfortable socializing now , @entity40 said			1
' everybody ( at the hospital ) knows him			0
he ’s such an animated guy			0
' while @entity1 ’s results are ' extraordinary , ' @entity40 said the full recovery will take more time			1
there ’s the challenge of teaching @entity1 , who has not eaten or spoken properly for 15 years , to use his fully functional face			1
the teeth plus the tongue is a lot to get used to when someone has gone so long without them , @entity40 said			2
additionally , minor surgery is planned for the soft tissue of his face , such as the eyelids where there is extra skin			0
but more than anything else , there is a looming question			0
even with immuno - suppressing drugs , doctors say they have no idea how long the transplant will last			2
there is an expectation that they will have to repair or replace the transplant eventually			0
dr @entity40 looks with hope to earlier face transplants			0
the world ’s first full face transplant took place in @entity227 in 2010 and is aging well two years later			2
the first partial transplant was done in @entity229 in 2005 , and @entity40 said its longevity is promising			0
' i ’d like to hit that 10 - year mark with @entity1 , ' he said			1
' of course , we ca n’t promise anything , but 10 years would be great			2
' in the meantime , @entity1 said he is excited to fish , golf and spend time with his family and friends			2
' my friends have moved on with their lives , starting families and careers , ' he said			0
' i can now start working on the life given back to me			0
