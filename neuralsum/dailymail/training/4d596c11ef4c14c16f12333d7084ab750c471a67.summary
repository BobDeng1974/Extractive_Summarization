by @entity0 the @entity2 ’s pilgrimage to the @entity3 was controversial because of the holy leader ’s impromptu prayer session at the @entity7 ’s barrier			0
and a playful religious disagreement also took place between @entity10 and @entity12 ’s prime minister , which revolved around @entity13 ’ linguistic skills			1
@entity15 and the @entity2 had a small , good natured squabble about the language spoken by @entity13			1
it is likely that @entity13 spoke a local @entity32 dialect and the towns of @entity34 was an @entity19 speaking community			1
despite the increasing importance of @entity37 , @entity19 was the dominant language among @entity39 in the @entity40 and across the @entity3 until the @entity42 conquest in the seventh century			2
@entity19 words frequently pop up in @entity45 text , such as ' @entity46 , @entity47 , ‘ and place names including @entity49 - the place where @entity13 took his disciples to pray before his arrest - are thought to have an @entity19 root			1
no - one really knows whether @entity13 could write			0
some experts believe he could speak @entity55 is divided as to whether the religious leader knew any @entity37 or @entity57			0
at a meeting in @entity59 , mr @entity15 told the @entity2 : ’ @entity13 was here , in this land			1
he spoke @entity24 , ’ in a bid to discuss the strong ties between @entity64 and @entity65			2
to which the smiling @entity2 corrected : ‘ @entity19			1
he spoke @entity19 , but he knew @entity24			2
’ most historians accept that @entity13 existed , although the events of his life are far from concrete			0
dr @entity71 , emeritus reader in @entity19 at @entity72 told @entity73 that both leaders are correct			0
@entity24 was the language of scholars and the scriptures , while @entity13 would have used the @entity19 tongue for his everyday conversations , he explained			1
most biblical scholars agree that @entity13 ( illustrated ) and his disciples spoke @entity19 , which was the common language of @entity28 in the first century @entity29 as well as perhaps a little @entity24			1
but opinion is divided as to whether he know any @entity37 or @entity57 most scholars agree that @entity13 spoke @entity19 in @entity45 , which was also the predominate language used by @entity84 in his film , @entity86			1
people also spoke @entity57 and @entity37 during the time of @entity13 , while @entity89 arrived later in @entity90			1
@entity91 , stipendiary lecturer in @entity92 at @entity72 , does not believe that @entity13 – a carpenter ’s son from @entity94 – would have spoken any more than a few words of @entity57			2
the language was largely spoken by @entity98 soldiers and was the language of law			0
it is slightly more likely that @entity13 would be more familiar with @entity37 , which was used by administrators across the @entity98			0
but again , dr @entity91 does not think that @entity13 would have been fluent			0
according to @entity39 historian @entity103 , @entity37 was seldom spoken at all in first century @entity12 and that it was extremely rare for a jew to know any @entity37			2
despite the holy leader ’s influence , it is unlikely that @entity13 could write in any language , dr @entity71 said			0
however , there is one account of @entity13 writing in the dust in @entity114 ’s gospel			0
the account of events though does not stipulate which language @entity13 was using , or whether he was drawing .			0

at a meeting in @entity59 , @entity12 's prime minister told the @entity2 that @entity13 spoke @entity24 and the @entity2 corrected him by saying ' @entity19 '
historians believe that @entity24 was the language of scholars and scriptures , so @entity13 probably spoke both dialects
@entity13 may have spoken a few words of @entity57 and @entity37
no - one knows the language he spoke for sure , or whether he could write
