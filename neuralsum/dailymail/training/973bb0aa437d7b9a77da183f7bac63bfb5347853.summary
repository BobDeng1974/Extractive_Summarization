of all the great lines , in all the films , it all had to come down to a plastic spaceman			1
according to a new poll , the greatest line in movie history is @entity8 ’s catchphrase : ‘ to infinity … and beyond ! ’ the public vote saw the line said by a toy astronaut in @entity15 ’s 1995 film @entity13 come out top by just one vote			1
third place went to ‘ say hello to my little friend ’ , screamed by @entity34 in 1983 ’s @entity35			1
the @entity37 vote is sure to split opinion , with only ten quotes chosen from an original shortlist of 50 and many favourites not included in the process at all			1
quotes that were chosen by the magazine to go to the public vote , but failed to attract enough support to make it into the final ten , include : ‘ may the @entity48 ’ from @entity49 and ‘ here ’s looking at you , kid ’ from @entity52			1
' i love the smell of napalm in the morning ’ from @entity55 , ‘ @entity56 means never having to say you ’re sorry ’ from @entity58 and ‘ the stuff that dreams are made of ’ from @entity62 , were not even up for consideration			1
' he 's not the @entity64 , he 's a very naughty boy ' : the @entity66 quip , spoken by @entity67 's mother - played by @entity69 - came in fourth in the top ten greatest movie quotes not even considered : @entity71 uttered the immortal line ' i love the smell of napalm in the morning , ' in the @entity75 , which did n't even feature in the @entity37 poll last out of the 50 was the famous line from @entity79 ’s thriller psycho : ‘ a boy ’s best friend is his mother ’ , which picked up just one vote from the 2,500 cast in total			1
the other famous lines in the top ten were ‘ he ’s not the @entity64			1
he ’s a very naughty boy ’ from @entity87 ’s @entity66 which came in fourth			2
it was spoken by @entity67 ’s mother , played by @entity69 , and is one of a series of jokes in which @entity67 is mistaken for @entity94			2
@entity95 came ‘ you ’re going to need a bigger boat ’ from @entity98 and @entity99 ’s ‘ frankly , my dear , i do n’t give a damn ’			2
carry on @entity105 , infamy , they ’ve all got it in for me ’ came in seventh , beating @entity107 ’s ‘ all those moments will be lost in time … like tears in rain ’			2
‘ @entity111 ’ from @entity112 and ‘ we want the finest wines available to humanity			0
and we want them here , and we want them now ’ from @entity117 & i came ninth and tenth respectively			0
just missing out was ‘ @entity119			0
@entity119 ’ , first uttered in 1962 ’s dr no by @entity121			0
film critic @entity122 , who worked with the magazine on the poll , revealed his favourite quote to be ‘ @entity131 ! my daddy ! ’ from the end of @entity127 , claiming it ‘ always brings a tear to my eye ’			1
however , even this did n’t make it onto the final list			0
mr @entity122 , who hosted the @entity136 ’s @entity135 from 1972 until 1998 , said : ‘ for me the power of words in films is just as great as that of visual images and helps to stamp the movie in my memory			0
' and certain lines have a potent effect on me , however many times i hear them			0
for instance , i have to confess that @entity150 ’s “ @entity131 ! my daddy ! ” at the end of @entity127 always brings a tear to my eyes			0
’ he said the success of the @entity13 line suggests many younger cinemagoers voted and , ‘ reflects the continuing popularity of films as emotional and intellectual entertainment ’			0
he added : ‘ @entity158 , perhaps , lies a message for television programmers : the audience – or at least the thinking part of it , which i believe is greater than most programmers seem to acknowledge – is just as interested in the content and quality of the films themselves as they are in interviews with the stars ’ .			0
