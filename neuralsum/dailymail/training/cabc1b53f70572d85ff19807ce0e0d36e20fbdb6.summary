@entity0 of @entity1 is suffering from crippling morning sickness , but another malady is starting to sweep the nation : royal baby fever			0
and it seems the second outbreak is set to be just as virulent as the first , with betting now suspended on whether the @entity8 , 32 , will be having twins			2
a surge of over 200 wagers caused bookmaker @entity12 to first slash the odds from 20 - 1 to 9 - 1 , and then , due to a suspicious number of new accounts being opened , suspend betting , followed by @entity17 less than 12 hours later			1
@entity0 of @entity1 is believed to be just over 12 weeks pregnant with her second child ' the fear is that so many people suddenly placing bets implies that there has been a leak of information			1
' we are now convinced that the @entity8 will give birth to twins following the sheer volume of bets we have taken this afternoon , ' said @entity17 ’s @entity30			1
' there has been huge support for royal twins since the news was announced , but today ’s gamble is the biggest indicator yet that someone knows something we do n’t			0
' another spokesperson for @entity12 , @entity40 , said : ' getting 200 plus bets in one - and - a - quarter hours , in that market , is incredible			1
' usually new accounts open when somebody bets on a new football manager , where it would be easy to suggest the punter had inside information			0
' while in terms of placing wagers this obviously constitutes dishonest betting , most of the public will be more interested in why so many are suddenly so sure of a double royal birth			0
@entity8 is believed to have just passed the 12 - week gestational period , a time when expectant mothers usually have their first scan - known as the ' dating scan '			2
twins ? bookmakers @entity12 have suspended betting on the @entity8 having two babies while little can be seen on this scan due to the small size of the foetus , one of the things that is determined , along with the baby 's growth and heartbeat , is whether the mother is expecting twins or triplets			1
there is , at present , no suggestion that the @entity8 has had this initial scan , or if she has , what it might have revealed			2
however , this sudden rush of betting will certainly raise speculation over whether @entity82 will soon be joined by multiple siblings			0
when contacted by the @entity85 @entity84 refused to comment on the speculation .			0

@entity12 received huge surge of bets , dropping odds from 20 - 1 to 9 - 1
number of bets and new accounts created to place them caused concern
fellow bookmakers @entity17 also suspended betting , just 12 hours later
thought to be around 12 weeks pregnant , @entity8 may have had her first scan
