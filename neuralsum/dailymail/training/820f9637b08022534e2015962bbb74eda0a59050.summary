click here to read why @entity1 might not start in a central role against @entity3 fortunes in football can turn on small details , and so it is in the case of @entity1			1
late on transfer deadline day , @entity10 manager @entity9 signed the @entity13 centre forward from @entity3 if not exactly against his better judgement , then certainly with some reservations			1
@entity9 had initially wanted to sign @entity16 from @entity17 , but had been put off by the astronomical weekly wage — in excess of £ 250,000 a week			1
as the two clubs prepare to face each other at the @entity43 , it would appear , for the moment at least , that @entity10 got the better deal			2
@entity1 heads into the game having scored five times for his new club this season and the same amount for @entity13			1
@entity16 , meanwhile , will stay behind in @entity50 on saturday nursing an injured calf , having made almost no impact at @entity26			1
‘ @entity9 wanted @entity16 but the numbers were too high , ’ an @entity10 source revealed this week			1
‘ he was n’t totally sure about @entity1 , was n’t sure he was exactly right			2
he thought his business was done for the summer and headed off to @entity56 on deadline day			0
’ @entity10 fans held reservations over @entity1 's finishing after he first arrived in north @entity61 @entity1 opened his @entity63 account for the @entity64 against @entity65 in september @entity1 has scored five goals for @entity10 , including a @entity68 hat - trick against @entity69 the 23 - year - old has also been in fine form for @entity13 , scoring five goals including this one against @entity73 @entity9 was actually refereeing a charity five - a - side game in @entity75 when the @entity1 deal became live			1
@entity77 wins 73 87 win percentage 35.10 41.83 draws 48 48 goals 284 315 av goals / game 1.37 1.51 total games 208 on the manager ’s say - so it was signed off by his chief negotiator at the @entity43 , @entity84			0
the @entity10 manager ’s reservations about @entity1 were familiar			1
@entity9 was , by all accounts , unsure about the centre forward ’s natural abilities as a finisher			2
the jury may remain out on that one — @entity1 has scored in a relatively modest three games for @entity10 so far — but it is understood that the @entity10 manager has been impressed by his new signing ’s willingness to learn , work and also with his link - up play			1
peculiarly , @entity1 has also transpired to be quicker than @entity9 thought			1
the striker was born in the @entity50 suburb of @entity101 and was spotted by @entity3 talent scouts when he was only six - years - old			2
for more reasons than this , he was always a popular player at @entity3 , as @entity106 ’s comments indicated on friday			2
impeccably mannered and fully understanding of team principles , he works hard on his finishing in training , even if it was not always the case			0
@entity1 was not always trusted at @entity3 where he had to compete with @entity106 and @entity112 @entity16 ( centre ) arrived at @entity3 on an expensive loan but has spent most of the season sidelined by injury the @entity28 slides on his knees after scoring against @entity119 , his only goal since arriving @entity3 manager @entity20 could regret his decision to let @entity1 leave @entity3 a @entity3 source told @entity123 this week : ‘ maybe when he was younger @entity1 did n’t do quite enough on his finishing as he could have , but that changed over time			1
‘ he puts the hours in now and has done over recent years			0
’ click here to read why @entity20 may be having second thoughts on signing @entity16 permanently at @entity26 , former @entity3 manager sir @entity128 always believed in @entity1			1
his successor @entity129 was not so sure but former @entity3 captain @entity130 and coach @entity131 have both subsequently criticised @entity20 ’s decision to sell him			1
‘ it ’s a strange one , ’ said @entity130			0
‘ i ca n’t work it out			0
’ @entity128 perhaps did n’t do the young forward that many favours by constantly playing him out of position			0
an accommodating type , @entity1 rarely complained about being shunted out to the right and the left , but it irritated those close to him , the feeling being that he was never given the opportunity to flourish in his natural position			2
this issue has always been at the heart of the @entity1 debate and working out which came first is something of a chicken - and - egg question			2
did @entity1 get shoved out wide because he was n’t scoring enough goals ? or did he not score enough goals because he was too rarely used as an central striker ? @entity9 speaks to stellar summer signing @entity154 on his return from international duty @entity158 could play some part against @entity3 after returning to fitness following an injury lay - off @entity162 ( left ) and @entity163 compete for the ball during the session at @entity166 certainly it was easy to feel sorry for him in the summer of 2012			1
having finished the previous season showing signs of a productive and natural partnership with @entity106 , @entity1 then saw @entity128 spend heavily on recruiting @entity112 from @entity10			1
perhaps that , in essence , was the end of @entity1 ’s chances at @entity3			1
whatever the case , new manager @entity176 appeared to get a little irritated when asked about @entity1 again on thursday			0
equally , the @entity16 topic is becoming an unpopular one			0
‘ it ’s not just a question of fitness , but also you have to train with the group , ’ the @entity3 manager said			0
‘ for now @entity16 does not train with the group so it ’s out of the question for him to be on the bench			0
with @entity1 , it was a good move for him			0
as a first choice he will develop himself much more			0
‘ if it was right for us depends how we play , how we score , and what position we shall finish in the league			0
’ sources close to @entity1 insisted this week that it was the player ’s decision to leave on hearing of @entity16 ’s imminent arrival in august			2
he was , they say , not prepared for another season among the supporting cast			0
if that is true then he is to be commended			0
equally , it is fair to say he still needs to become more clinical in front of goal and learn to score more frequently in the really big games			0
the @entity207 manager speaks to his injury - ravaged side as they prepare for the trip to the @entity43 @entity13 captain @entity106 ( centre ) and youngster @entity212 ( right ) race each other in training record signing @entity217 ( left ) has been passed fit after picking up a cut on international duty @entity1 ’s most high - profile goal for @entity3 was probably his strike at @entity222 in the @entity68 in february 2013			1
apart from that , he scored twice against @entity224 and @entity10 in three full @entity63 seasons for @entity3 and once against @entity226			1
this season his goals for his new club have come against @entity65 , @entity69 and @entity229			0
saturday would certainly be a good day to buck that particular trend			0
@entity10 ’s other main striker @entity158 is fit again and , for @entity1 , the battle for the no 9 slot will soon begin all over again .			2

@entity10 host @entity3 in their @entity63 clash on saturday
@entity1 will come up against his former club after being sold by @entity20 for £ *16million* in the summer
@entity9 was said to have preferred signing @entity16 , who has managed only a single goal since arriving at @entity26
@entity1 has scored five goals for his club and another five for @entity13
