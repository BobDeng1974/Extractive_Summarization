by @entity1 reporter millions face a postcode lottery in gp services as chronic underfunding has left doctors surgeries ' on the brink of collapse ' , a top medic has warned			2
@entity10 carried out by the @entity11 ( @entity11 ) showed a stark divide in access to doctors , with people living in the most deprived communities facing the longest waiting times			1
the study found that 22 per cent of people in @entity20 raised concerns about not being able to make an appointment with their gp			1
millions face a postcode lottery in gp services as chronic underfunding has left doctors surgeries ' on the brink of collapse ' whereas the figure was just five per cent in @entity31 and north - east @entity32			1
there are ' shocking discrepancies ' in the number of @entity36 employed locally , the @entity11 warned			2
@entity37 , east and west @entity38 have 60 gps for every 100,000 patients - three times as many as @entity42 in @entity43 which has just 22			1
the poorest appear to be the hardest hit - eight of out of ten areas with the longest gp waiting times having moderate to high levels of deprivation			1
the @entity11 said the research , based on the @entity49 , showed the profession is ' creaking under the weight of a growing and ageing population '			1
they have launched a campaign to demand an extra Â£ 3.5 billion a year to be ploughed into gp services , and have put up posters in surgeries showing patients having to queue down the street for an appointment unless extra cash is found			2
dr @entity62 , chairwoman of the @entity11 said : ' every single patient should be able to see their gp when they are in need of medical assistance , regardless of where they live			2
' it is absolutely shocking that , due to the current funding crisis in general practice , patients are now facing a postcode lottery			0
there are ' shocking discrepancies ' in the number of @entity36 employed locally , the @entity11 warned ' it is doubly unacceptable that those patients affected tend to be those who live in deprived parts of the country			1
' a growing and ageing population coupled with a surge in patients with multiple and chronic conditions was piling pressure on @entity36 , but their share of the @entity91 budget has been slashed , she said			0
dr @entity62 said : ' family doctors are working harder than ever - but with increasing patient demand , due to a growing and ageing population , and plummeting investment , there simply are n't enough @entity36 to go round			0
' there is now a desperate shortage of @entity36 in many parts of the country , leaving the service teetering on the brink of collapse			0
she added : ' over the last decade , investment in general practice has slumped and has now reached an all - time low , with gps conducting 90 per cent of @entity91 patient contacts for just 8.5 per cent of the total @entity91 budget			1
' gps want to provide high - quality care for every single patient , but at a time of plummeting resources we are seeing 40 million more patients a year than just five years ago			1
' the simple fact is that family doctors are now heaving under unsustainable workloads , with the majority now routinely conducting 60 patient consultations in a single day			0
' the @entity11 said the number of visits to @entity36 has soared from an estimated 300m to 340m in the past five years , and at least 10,000 more gps need to be recruited to ease the pressure			1
dr @entity126 , president of the @entity127 said : ' patients across the country are frequently unable to obtain a timely appointment with a gp , because there simply are n't enough gps in some local areas			2
' this postcode lottery is totally inappropriate with clear and potentially serious implications for patients			0
' it is clear that the root of the problem is a shortage of @entity36 and the lack of funding for general practice			0
without appropriate funding for general practice the situation for patients will only deteriorate			0
' @entity149 said they are recruiting and training more gps			0
a spokeswoman said : ' patients should have good access to health services , regardless of where they live			0
' this year , for the first time , @entity149 introduced a deprivation factor into local health budgets to start to redress historic funding issues			0
