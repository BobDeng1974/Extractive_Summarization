energy secretary @entity0 said @entity1 had a ' moral duty ' to act around the world critics of the government ’s spending on foreign aid were dismissed as @entity8 by the @entity10 climate change secretary yesterday			1
@entity0 praised @entity1 ’s £ 720million pledge to a new @entity13 fund to tackle climate change in the @entity15 , saying it was our moral duty to act			1
the @entity1 is among a number of nations meeting in @entity20 to contribute to the @entity21 , which helps poor countries adapt to low carbon energy , such as wind			1
much of the money will be spent shoring up sea and flood defences in less - developed areas			1
@entity30 backbenchers said it would be better spent on flood defences at home , amid fears the @entity35 could again be deluged			1
the @entity36 said flood spending in @entity38 was ‘ insufficient ’ to maintain defences			2
but mr @entity0 , the @entity40 , said : ‘ the poorest and most vulnerable on the planet are already suffering the effects of climate change and it ’s our moral duty to act			1
‘ the idea that we should be isolationist @entity8 is a complete nonsense			0
‘ from protecting low - lying islands and coastal settlements from the impact of rising sea levels to helping farmers struggling with lower crop yields caused by weather effects of climate change – @entity1 aid can save lives			1
‘ other major economies such as the @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 have made substantial pledges , and i urge other countries to be equally ambitious			0
’ he told @entity67 ’s today programme that climate change around the world has implications for the @entity1 , affecting supply chains of groceries and other products			2
‘ people listening , i think , recognise that we live in a global economy where when something happens in another part of the world it can affect our lives here , ’ he said			0
conservative mp sir @entity83 , former chairman of the commons public accounts committee , said it was not appropriate to spend so much money elsewhere with the @entity1 still borrowing £ 100billion a year			1
‘ we have to look at the interests of the taxpayer and our own people , ’ he told the same programme			0
@entity30 mp sir @entity0 said he had no problem with helping other countries , but @entity1 flood defences needed to be shored up ‘ we had appalling scenes at the @entity35 last year			1
i ’ve had villages flooded in @entity96			0
‘ as the @entity36 said , we ’re still not spending enough on flood alleviation			0
first of all we need to spend the money here			0
i ’m happy to give money to humanitarian projects			0
' i ’m happy to spend money properly on protecting a village in @entity104 from being flooded , but i do n’t want to commit now to £ 650million on spec. ’ @entity106 , a former government adviser on climate change , said : ‘ to suggest we must choose between investing in flood defences in the @entity1 or helping international efforts to tackle the greenhouse gas emissions that are causing sea levels to rise along @entity1 coasts			1
is to misunderstand both the phenomenon itself and the basics of policy			0
' reducing risk and managing the effects of climate change must go hand in hand			0
’ at the @entity20 conference , aimed at encouraging governments to give money to the fund , the @entity59 has pledged £ 1.92billion , @entity60 has offered £ 959million , and @entity62 and @entity61 will offer £ 640million each			2
@entity125 , of @entity126 , said : ‘ this is a big step forward in the fight against climate change and is further evidence that the @entity1 is a global leader in tackling poverty			2

' this pledge will help build momentum for a global deal in @entity142 next year to cut emissions			0
