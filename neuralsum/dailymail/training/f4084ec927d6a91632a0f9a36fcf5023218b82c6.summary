by @entity0 medical experts have called for a permanent ban on selling cigarettes to anyone born in this century in a bid to eradicate smoking from @entity7 entirely			1
the radical plan would see the age limit for buying tobacco - currently set at 18 - rise every year until the last cigarette smokers died out , at which point smoking would be illegal for everyone			1
doctors have asked the powerful @entity16 to lobby the government for a ban on tobacco sales to people born after the year 2000			1
smoking kills more than 100,000 people a year in the @entity7 by causing diseases such as lung cancer and emphesyma , according to the @entity25			1
crackdown : doctors have called for a permanent ban on selling cigarettes to anyone born after the year 2000 while rates of cigarette smoking have been falling in @entity7 for decades , around 20 per cent of people still smoke despite anti-tobacco measures such as the ban on smoking inside			1
at the @entity16 's public health conference in @entity37 last week , doctors urged the government to bring in draconian measures which will stop young people smoking in the first place			2
' @entity42 has never developed anything more deadly than the cigarette , ' said @entity46 - @entity45 , a registrar working in @entity47			0
' the combination of its addictive power and devastating health effects combined with historical social norms and powerful advertising campaigns killed 100million people in the 20th century			0
' the continuing epidemic is predicted to kill hundreds of millions more over the 21st century			0
' plea : the calls were led by dr @entity45 , a registrar from @entity57 he cited statistics showing that 80 per cent of smokers start when they are teenagers , and that someone who starts smoking aged 15 is three times as likely to die of a related cancer than smokers who start in their 20s			2
' this is a highly addictive product that kills 50 per cent of the users and it is so patently over the balance of harm that we must now work to prevent the next generation from falling into the nicotine trap , ' dr @entity45 added			0
' i do not want our children smoking and nor should anybody else			0
if they have n't already started , then let 's keep them smoke free for life			0
' senior doctor @entity82 agreed , saying : ' if we prevent access to a group that is growing older through time then gradually we will stop easy access to tobacco products			0
' currently retailers are barred from selling cigarettes or other tobacco products to anyone under the age of 18 , with fines of up to £ 2,500 for anyone caught selling to children , enforced by local trading standards agencies			1
if the proposed legislation came into effect , the existing ban would be replaced by a prohibition on selling tobacco to anyone born on or after january 1 , 2000			2
however , public health expert @entity102 suggested that the policy would prove unworkable and claimed it was ' nonsensical ' to target one age group rather than embarking on wider anti-tobacco efforts			0
controversy : one famous case of tobacco companies ' wrongdoing was dramatised in the 1999 @entity113 film @entity114 , starring @entity115 the @entity16 conference also heard calls for local councils in @entity7 to withdraw all their investments from funds connected to tobacco companies			1
@entity122 said that local authorities ' pension funds had more than £ 1billion invested in smoking - related funds , despite their duty to improve the health of their constituents			1
he added : ' this obviously creates a gross conflict of interest if ever there was one , whereby practitioners have to choose in a methodological fashion between maximising the health of their population on the one hand against maximising their income on retirement on the other hand			0
' the tobacco industry is immensely profitable but has long been controversial thanks to repeated allegations of wrongdoing such as deliberately marketing cigarettes to children			2
one of the most high - profile cases , when tobacco firm @entity151 allegedly worked to make their cigarettes more addictive , was exposed by whistleblower @entity153 and later dramatised in 1999 @entity113 hit @entity114 , starring @entity115 .			2

experts call on the @entity16 to lobby @entity156 for a total ban
the age limit for buying cigarettes would rise every year until smoking is completely eliminated
doctors also *criticise* local councils ' £ 1billion investment in tobacco funds
more than 100,000 @entity7 die every year from smoking - related diseases
