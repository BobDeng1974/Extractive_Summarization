by @entity0 re-examination of a 100,000 - year - old human skull found 35 years ago in @entity3 suggests they were closer than thought in physiology to @entity7			1
a study has revealed the surprising presence of an inner - ear formation long thought to occur only in @entity7			1
and it lends further credence to the theory that @entity7 were wiped out through interbreeding with other humans			1
a skull in @entity3 has been found with a trait once thought unique to @entity7			1
the @entity18 temporal bone is shown here with the extracted temporal labyrinth , an inner - ear formation thought long gone by 100,000 years ago			1
it is also shown with its position in the temporal bone they are often depicted as dim - witted evolutionary losers , but @entity7 were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains , a previous study by the @entity25 and @entity26 suggests			1
instead , it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors , scientists believe			1
an analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years stripped away some of the myths surrounding @entity7 and revealed they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought			2
the differences between the two human sub-species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the @entity7 , said the @entity45 and @entity47 researchers			0
@entity48 could be one reason why @entity7 vanished , according to the scientists			0
they were not so much driven to extinction as assimilated			0
evidence of the two mixing can be seen in the fossil record			0
some human - like characteristics have been found in late @entity7 fossils , and conversely , @entity7 features have been seen in early specimens of modern humans in @entity59			1
study co-author @entity60 , @entity61 , a physical anthropology professor at @entity63 in @entity64 , said the discovery ' places into question ' how humans from the @entity67 period ( 2.6 million to 11,700 years ago ) dispersed			2
' it suggests , instead , that the later phases of human evolution were more of a labyrinth of biology and peoples than simple lines on maps would suggest , ' he said			2
the study in the @entity80 is based on recent @entity82 scans of a fossilised human skull found during 1970s excavations at the @entity18 site in @entity3 ’s @entity86			1
' we were completely surprised , ' @entity60 contiued			0
' we fully expected the scan to reveal a temporal labyrinth that looked much like a modern human one , but what we saw was clearly typical of a @entity7			0
' instead the researchers found an arrangement of semicircular canals in the ear that places into question whether this was unique to @entity7			2
the presence of this particular arrangement of the semicircular canals in the temporal labyrinth had previously been considered enough to securely identify fossilised skull fragments as being from a @entity7			2
this pattern is present in almost all of the known @entity7 labyrinths			0
it has been widely used as a marker to set them apart from both earlier and modern humans			0
the discovery the later humans have the same trait , however , could now call into question whether other fossilised remains truly belonged to @entity7			0
and it also raises more questions about where @entity7 lived , as previously they were thought to live almost entirely in @entity59 this diagram of the inner - ear shows the temporal labyrinth in yellow			1
the presence of this arrangement of canals had previously been thought enough to confirm a skull as belonging to a @entity7 , but that now appears to not be the case and suggests they may have interbred with early humans a previous study by the @entity25 and @entity26 said it was likely that @entity7 ( stock image shown ) disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding with our early modern human ancestors , based on analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years the skull at the centre of this study , known as @entity18 15 , was found along with an assortment of other human teeth and bone fragments , all of which seemed to have characteristics typical of an early @entity143 form of late archaic humans			1
@entity60 , who has studied @entity7 and early human fossils from around the globe , said this discovery only adds to the rich confusion of theories that attempt to explain human origins , migrations patterns and possible interbreedings			0
' the study of human evolution has always been messy , and these findings just make it all the messier , ' @entity60 said			2
' it shows that human populations in the real world do n’t act in nice simple patterns			0
' @entity60 also explains how migration patterns between @entity162 and @entity59 took thousands of years to play out , further complicating matters			0
' this study shows that you ca n’t rely on one anatomical feature or one piece of @entity168 as the basis for sweeping assumptions about the migrations of hominid species from one place to another , ' he concluded			0
the discovery of this skull in @entity162 , rather than @entity59 , also raises more questions about where @entity7 lived , as previously they were thought to live almost entirely in @entity59			1
shown is a map of their distribution in the times they were believed to inhabit @entity184 the skull at the center of this study , known as @entity18 15 , was found along with an assortment of other human teeth and bone fragments , all of which seemed to have characteristics typical of an early @entity143 form of late archaic humans ( stock image shown )			2

skull from @entity3 was found with a trait that was thought unique
the inner - ear formation was believed to be solely from @entity7
100,000 year - old skull was first found 35 years ago but was re-examined
it lends further theory to the ' extinction by interbreeding ' theory and suggests history of human evolution is ' messier ' than thought
it also raises more questions about where @entity7 lived , as previously they were thought to live almost entirely in @entity59
