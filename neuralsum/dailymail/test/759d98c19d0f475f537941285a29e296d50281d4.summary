@entity1 dressed in a bowler hat and waistcoat , these civilians may look like respectable members of society in @entity6			0
in fact , they were the drunkards banned from every boozer in @entity9 for a string of crimes including drink - driving a steam engine , riding a horse while drunk and being intoxicated to the point of ' complete incompetence '			1
they were all placed on the 1904 blacklist after four convictions under the @entity18 of 1898			1
the list was then sent to landlords who were not allowed to sell them alcohol			2
offenders who were caught drunk and disorderly were ordered to work up to 21 days of ' hard labour ' in comparison to today 's fixed penalty or fine			1
they form part of the @entity62 @entity61 , which covers a 400 year period and contains more than 21 million records detailing the good , the bad and the famous who have shaped the history of the city			0
unearthed by @entity70 , the world 's largest online family history resource , the records are available for all to see			0
@entity73 : @entity74 was a 29 - year - old prostitute when she was arrested for drunkenness and sentenced to two weeks ' hard labour @entity77 : charwoman @entity78 was arrested for drunken behaviour in february 1906 criminal : each notice bore a mugshot of the criminal , as well as a description of their nose and face ; @entity88 was said to have a ' fresh complexion ' despite being sentenced to three weeks ' hard labour poster : unemployed @entity91 , another woman convicted of being drunk and disorderly , was described as having a ' broad ' build , as well as losing her right eye and having ' both little fingers crooked ' some of the bizarre offences committed by past @entity9 residents include theft of a dead duck and riding a horse while drunk			1
nearly 10,000 @entity101 felons are listed in the @entity103 criminal registers providing fascinating insight into the murky underworld of @entity9 's metropolis more than a century ago			2
among those on the blacklist are @entity109 , 40 , who was sentenced to a year 's hard labour and three months ' police supervision after stealing eight pounds of ham			1
elsewhere , 18 - year - old @entity113 was sentenced to eight months ' hard labour and one - year 's police supervision for stealing a ' dead duck ' and a teapot			2
careers : @entity119 combined her job as a dressmaker with an extra source of income as a prostitute , before being banned from pubs for being drunk and disorderly @entity127 : just 38 , @entity128 looked a lot older than her years when she was arrested for drunkenness distinctive : @entity132 , left , and @entity133 , right , could be recognised by their scars , according to the @entity9 archives records reveal how offenders came from a variety of backgrounds , such as metal cutters , grease merchants , labourers and hawkers			1
many had aliases - suggesting criminal careers - while others had scars or physical handicaps , ranging from @entity91 's one eye to cut marks on faces , broken noses and missing fingers			0
some , however , lived perfectly respectable lives - until they walked through the door of their local watering hole			0
it shows how those living in @entity6 were just as likely to get half - cut and troublesome on a night out as boozy @entity162 in today 's binge drinking culture .			0
