by @entity0 @entity1 took chicken farmer @entity2 to court after one of the residents neighbouring the farm made a complaint a magistrate has laughed a council out of court after they hauled a rural farmer to the dock for failing to stop his chickens crowing too loudly			1
@entity2 , 52 , laughed when he first heard @entity1 's plan to drag him in front of magistrates over his free range chicken farm near @entity18 , @entity19			2
mr @entity2 is accused of falling fowl of a noise abatement order he received three years ago calling on him to prevent his chickens ‘ crowing at a level likely to result in reasonable cause for complaint from occupiers of nearby residential properties '			1
but despite baffled magistrates refusing to enforce a fine , mr @entity2 has still been left with £ 115 legal costs and a criminal record following the barmy conviction			1
he said : ' what next ? are they going to complain about the birds in the trees being too noisy ? ' my business has been here since 2002 and all of a sudden they are too noisy - it just does n't make any sense			0
' the magistrates laughed the case out of court as they thought it was a waste of time and money so i do n't understand why the council were allowed to take it this far			0
' i thought it was a joke when the council first phoned me up about a complaint from a neighbour about my chickens being too loud - it 's absolute madness that i now have a conviction for it			0
' mr @entity2 claims he was ' bullied ' into pleading guilty to failing to comply with the noise abatement notice after council officials threatened to involve costly lawyers and charge him for the legal bills			1
mr @entity2 claims he was ' bullied ' into pleading guilty to failing to comply with the noise abatement notice he added : ' the council have been totally against me the whole way			1
they threatened to get a barrister in and charge me for costs			2
' i was worried it was going to end up costing me thousands so i felt bullied into accepting the charge			0
' mr @entity2 appeared in the dock charged with breaching a noise abatement notice - despite the council admitting no decibel readings were ever taken			1
instead the charge was brought merely on the basis of a council officer 's ‘ professional opinion ' following a visit to the farm			0
the life - long farmer was handed a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 115 legal costs at @entity88 last week			1
the life - long farmer was handed a conditional discharge and ordered to pay £ 115 legal costs at @entity88 chairman of the bench @entity93 said : ' i am not sure it 's written down anywhere how many decibels a cockerel is allowed to make			1
' it 's a farm with chickens so you expect to hear noise			0
' we 're giving you a conditional discharge as we really do n't want to waste any more time on it			2
' the neighbour who made the complaint against mr @entity2 declined to comment when approached for an interview			2
@entity107 , a @entity108 district councillor , defended the court action saying : ' although this is quite an unusual case , it is clear that the noise caused by the animals was excessive , often taking place over night , and as such action was required			0
' excessive noise either from a residential or commercial property can make people 's lives a misery and in this case despite having a large plot of land , the cockerels were being housed in a way that was causing upset for neighbours			0
' the council will always look to act when appropriate to do so			0
