the picture in the papers of a resplendent @entity2 , dressed for an awards ceremony in glorious technicolour , was the thing that really got to me			1
frankly , it made me quite envious as i went to my own wardrobe to get ready for work and found the familiar row of black tops , black trousers and a few scarves in muted colours			1
they have been my uniform since @entity17 - the day i was sent home after the operation to excise my breast cancer and entire right breast			1
the grief i went through during that awful period eight years ago was all - consuming			2
my mother died the day i was diagnosed and was cremated four days after my mastectomy			2
i struggled to be there to send her on her way			2
lost confidence : @entity28 in bright colours ( left ) before cancer and in black today my father followed her a mere six months later when i was in the midst of chemotherapy			1
so black was an entirely appropriate colour for the circumstances in which i found myself			1
i remember my consultant , professor @entity37 , saying at an early check - up : ' we 'll know when you 're beginning to recover			2
you 'll start wearing colours again and brighten up your make - up			2
it 's generally the first sign			1
' but it has n't happened			1
i was never really the type to have @entity2 's confidence and go out in a vibrant combination of oranges , reds and pinks			1
but , tucked at the back of my wardrobe - waiting for the day i regain whatever confidence that terrible time of my life seems to have destroyed - there are pinks and reds and my favourite turquoise blue			1
often , as i prepare to get dressed in the morning , i think about going for it			0
' come on , you 're well , brighten up ' , i mutter to myself			0
but still i find myself walking out of the front door swathed from top to bottom in comforting black			0
the best friend of one of my sons got married a couple of months ago			0
the venue was in the middle of countryside around @entity71			0
dozens of women , young and old , flitted about like radiant multi-coloured butterflies			1
dark days : @entity28 lost her hair after chemotherapy to treat her breast cancer yet , i was more suitably attired for a funeral than the nuptials of a young man i 've loved like a son since he was a tiny tot			1
i could n't wait to leave			1
that celebration of youth and perfection and a future full of hope felt nearly too much to bear			0
i 've begun to dread these gorgeous summer days , knowing i wo n't want to go to parties where everyone else is dressed in skimpy , colourful attire while i , like some dour @entity95 widow , cower in a corner , feeling hot and dull in my day - to - day uniform of black			1
i am , though , not alone in this			0
of all the friends who 've shared my experience of diagnosis and treatment - and they are legion - only one displays the same taste in high fashion , bright as can be , that she enjoyed @entity106 : before @entity107			1
" the clothes we wear seem to be partly an exercise in denial and partly the concealment of the evidence that we can no longer trust our bodies to be as healthy or as attractive as they once were ... " let 's call her @entity118			1
she 's a couple of years older than me , was diagnosed a couple of years after me - immediately following her marriage to a man with whom she 'd fallen passionately in love			2
it seemed such a terrible blow when she was so deliriously happy , but she handled her treatment like a military operation , planning full reconstruction of her lost breast as soon as it was feasible and making sure she had a top - class plastic surgeon to do it			1
@entity118 now proudly boasts two pretty identical breasts - one completely natural , the other formed from muscles in her back - and wears clothes that make her stand out in any crowd			0
she even sports a bikini on holiday			0
like me she 's reluctant to go for the full @entity141 on the reconstruction front			2
i think we both felt we 'd had enough serious surgery once the mastectomy was done , to put up with any more			0
we both had implants put into the mutilated side and wear a bra prosthesis to match it up			0
unlike @entity118 , though , we do n't have a perfectly reconstructed side , just a bit of a lump and unsightly scar			2
like me , @entity140 spends most of her time in black or grey			0
i assume that @entity118 's enthusiasm for wanting to return to the woman she was , and the time and pain she was prepared to invest in it , came as a result of being in the throes of a new passion and being determined not to disappoint			1
for the rest of us , the clothes we wear seem to be partly an exercise in denial and partly the concealment of the clear evidence that we can no longer trust our bodies to be as healthy or as attractive as they once were			2
i remember dress designer , @entity171 , saying that her style - clothes in unobtrusive colours that loosely skim the body - came from her days as a girl in @entity176 when the way you looked was of paramount importance			0
contrast : @entity28 wore pink in 1999 when she was awarded her obe , left , when she was made a @entity184 in 2011 , she wore black @entity171 realised then , she said , that most women do n't have what â€™s judged to be the perfect physique , and merely require clothes with which they can conceal their bodies and make themselves seem to disappear			1
this seems to be what 's going on with the attire of friends who 've had breast cancer			1
if women who 've suffered no mutilation are keen to disappear , how much worse must it be for those of us to whom the scalpel - albeit to save our lives - has done its worst			2
@entity202 became the colour of mourning during the @entity205 and it is the friends who 've had breast cancer who seem to fall into this pattern most often			1
we seem to be saying , ' even when faced with incontrovertible evidence something truly disfiguring has occurred , deny it , deny it , deny it and hide it away			0
' friends who 've had other forms of cancer seem to suffer less from this belief that you are not the woman you once were			1
with breast cancer , the feeling is that the very part of us that once defined our femininity - whether it was our sexual attractiveness or our ability to feed our children - has been brutally taken away			1
this is demonstrated by two photographs that i see every time i walk up the stairs at my home			0
the first was taken in 1999 outside @entity237 just after i 'd been awarded the obe			0
i 'm with my partner , @entity239 , my mother , win , and my younger son , @entity241 , and i 'm wearing a lovely pink silk suit and smiling brightly			0
the second was taken in 2011 , five years after @entity17 , after i was made a @entity184			0
my mother is no longer with us			0
@entity239 looks much the same and both my now grown - up sons proudly flank me			0
this time i am in a black hat , black jacket , black top , black trousers and black shoes and i 'm smiling , but somewhat wanly			0
i see a different woman from the one before			2
i 'd like to see her in the pink , but am not sure i ever will .			0

@entity28 has worn dark shades since having breast cancer treatment
she 's envious of women like @entity2 who are confident in colour
believes the *disease* is *responsible* for her wardrobe *choices*
@entity202 *reflects* how she does n't feel like healthy woman she once was
