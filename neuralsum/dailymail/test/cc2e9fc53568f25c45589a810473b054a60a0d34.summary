the world 's longest ever kidney donation chain linked its final donor to ailing recipient last month when a @entity5 woman became the 34th person whose life was saved by the record - setting program			1
@entity9 , 77 , was successfully matched with a @entity11 man after turning to the @entity13 's paired exchange program -- her only option since her age barred her from receiving a deceased donor 's organ			2
when she received the kidney march 26 , the operation completed a nationwide chain that linked strangers from @entity22 to @entity23 who have loved ones in need with patients desperately in need of a transplant			1
32 lives saved : @entity9 , 77 , ( left ) was the last link in a chain of 34 kidney transplants -- the world 's longest such chain to date			1
she received a kidney because her husband @entity37 gave his kidney to a patient in need unbreakable love : @entity9 has suffered from kidney disease for most of her 53 - year marriage to @entity37			1
she received a kidney march 26 thanks to his generosity on the day of @entity51 's transplant , eight surgeons in four states linked five hospitals through transplants			1
@entity51 , who 's battled kidney disease much of her life , received her kidney after her husband -- who was not a match for her -- gave his kidney to someone else in need			2
in turn , @entity51 received an organ from @entity64 , 55 , who lives outside of @entity11 , reports @entity65			2
@entity64 's wife @entity66 's type 1 diabetes caused her to need a new kidney , which she received thanks to her husband 's donation			0
' if it took for me to give my kidney to somebody in order to get @entity66 a good healthy kidney , i 'm ready to do it , ' @entity64 told @entity65 , which will air a story about the record - breaking chain on @entity81 on tuesday evening			1
the last length of this historic chain began at the @entity84 in @entity85 when @entity86 donated a kidney on behalf of her brother , who 'd already received a transplant			2
her kidney was driven 250 miles to @entity90 in @entity91 , where it was transplanted into @entity93			0
a friend of @entity93 's daughter , 44 - year - old paralegal @entity94 , donated the kidney that allowed @entity93 to receive a transplant			2
her organ was flown 368 miles to @entity100 then picked up by a courier and driven to @entity102			0
starts with altruism : the chain that ended with @entity105 receiving a lifesaving transplant began months prior when @entity108 attorney @entity107 gave a kidney without having a loved one in need of a transplant ( file ) a kidney was then taken from @entity102 to @entity11 and transplanted into @entity115			1
her husband @entity64 's kidney was removed and taken to @entity118 , @entity5 via a flight to @entity120 and a 133 - mile drive			1
that 's where @entity51 's received it			0
as @entity65 notes , these chains ca n't start without a donor who gives his or her kidney in exchange for nothing			0
this particular chain began with @entity107 , a @entity108 attorney , who told @entity65 her unbelievably altruistic choice was an easy one to make			0
' i think the fact that it was to a stranger is one of the parts that people have a really hard time grasping			0
but it actually even makes it easier , ' she said			0
' from the very beginning i did n't have an attachment to the outcome or any judgment attached to who gets it or who 's deserving â€¦ i have an opportunity to give , and why would n't i ? '			0

the life - saving trend saves lives by allowing donors to give kidneys to strangers in order for a loved one to receive a kidney
twenty - six hospitals were involved in the record - setting chain over the course of three months
@entity5 recipient @entity9 , 77 , became the final link in the chain march 26
