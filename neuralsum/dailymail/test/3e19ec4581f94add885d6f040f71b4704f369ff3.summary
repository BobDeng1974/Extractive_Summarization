@entity0 has finally replied to the infamous note left in the @entity2 by a @entity4 predecessor , saying there was ' no money ' left			1
@entity7 , who was chief secretary to the treasury under @entity9 , left a memo on his desk after @entity4 's election defeat in 2010			1
the memo , found by his @entity14 successor @entity14 , said : ' dear chief secretary , i 'm afraid that there is no money			1
kind regards and good luck			0
' mr @entity0 , the present chief secretary , today finally got round to sending a letter to mr @entity7 apologising for the late reply – saying it was because he had been ' fixing the economy '			1
it said : ' the deficit halved			0
that 's the @entity14 record , ' he wrote			2
@entity51 sparked a furious response from @entity53 earlier this month after he dismissed the letter as a ' jokey note '			2
the note has become emblematic of @entity4 's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by mr @entity53 in the seven - way leaders ' debate earlier this month			1
when the @entity50 took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £ 150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy			1
but mr @entity65 insisted the note admitting that @entity4 had blown the nation 's finances should not be taken seriously			1
@entity14 leader @entity69 is joined by his wife @entity70 at @entity71 in @entity72 today the deputy prime minister is hoping his message that the @entity14 can be trusted with the economy will help turn around his party 's dire position in the polls he told @entity79 : ' @entity7 's note was a jokey note … of the course the money had n't run out			1
' mr @entity51 said @entity4 would cut the deficit – still running at £ 90billion a year – every year			2
he said : ' nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing			0
i think in tough times , people want a government which will make tough decisions , and will make the sums add up , and that is what we 're saying very clearly today			0
' but he was asked if @entity4 was ' credible ' and could be trusted with the economy			2
@entity7 , who was chief secretary to the treasury under @entity9 , left the original memo on his desk after @entity4 's election defeat mr @entity51 said : ' i think people want to know the sums add up			1
people know that the global financial crisis was n't caused by @entity4 's spending – it was n't @entity4 's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the @entity110 investment bank went bankrupt in @entity111			1
' @entity7 's note was a jokey note , of course the money had n't run out			1
' mr @entity51 blamed the @entity14 minister @entity14 for leaking the note			2
he said it was supposed to be a private note , adding : ' it was supposed to be a piece of humour			0
in fact , in that year , the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds , so of course the money had n't run out , but there was a large deficit , and we had to get it down , and we needed to get it down in a fair way			0
' the reason why we 're more credible than the @entity35 now is that they 're not people who understand the need for change in the economy , it 's not been all in it together , they 've not even balanced the books – it 's going to take a @entity4 government to do it			1
' the prime minister said @entity146 's response was ' frankly the most appalling thing i have heard in this election campaign so far '			0
he claimed @entity51 was @entity151 's third choice to be shadow chancellor and was frankly ' the country 's last choice to be put in charge of this nation 's finances '			0
he said : ' the note that was left was correct			0
it said there was no money left			0
let us think about the consequences of what we inherited and what we had to do			0
we had to make difficult decisions , we had to find efficiencies in government spending , we had to put up some taxes			0
' we had to make some very very difficult decisions to get this country back on track			0
that note that said there is no money left was referring to the fact that our budget deficit was forecast to be bigger than the budget deficit in @entity179 when i became prime minister			2

@entity4 's @entity7 left a memo for the *incoming* @entity50 government
the letter , left on mr @entity7 's desk , read : ' i 'm afraid there is no money '
treasury secretary @entity0 has finally responded to the note
mr @entity0 wrote : ' sorry for the late reply , i 've been fixing the economy '
