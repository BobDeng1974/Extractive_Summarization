@entity0 was hailed the shock winner of last night ’s tv debate according to one snap poll , inflicting a damaging blow to @entity6 ’s election hopes			1
in a nightmare for @entity9 , which is battling to fend off an @entity11 landslide in its traditional @entity13 heartlands , @entity7 was deemed well ahead – with mr @entity6 trailing @entity14 and @entity15			1
overall , an average of four polls of viewers put mr @entity14 just ahead – and to the @entity20 ’ delight , he also emerged with a clear lead on who is seen ‘ most capable of leading the country ’			1
last night a national voting intention poll by @entity32 put the @entity33 ahead of their vote share at the last election , and at their highest point since 2013 , with 37 per cent to @entity9 ’s 35 per cent			2
but it was miss @entity0 ’s success among viewers across the @entity40 that was the biggest surprise of the night			0
peeping out : the @entity33 poster depicting @entity6 in @entity0 's pocket the @entity20 rushed out a poster depicting @entity6 in @entity0 ’s pocket last night – saying the @entity11 leader had ‘ dominated ’ him in the debate			1
a hapless - looking @entity9 leader was seen peering out of the top pocket of a contented @entity7 , who triumphed in one of the main post-debate polls			1
if @entity9 fails to win a majority in the election , it is expected that mr @entity6 may have to come to a deal with the @entity56 if he is to get into @entity57			1
a tweet from conservative campaign headquarters said : ‘ @entity0 dominated @entity6 – an interesting glimpse into what life would be like under a @entity6 / @entity11 deal ’			2
the poster follows a similar one released last month showing mr @entity6 in the pocket of former @entity11 leader @entity67 , who has declared that he will help write the @entity9 budget			1
it revives memories of the 1980s @entity72 depiction of the then @entity74 leader @entity73 in the pocket of @entity76 , leader of the @entity77			0
the two parties were in alliance at the time			0
@entity13 ’s steely first minister left the @entity9 leader squirming as she attacked him from the @entity82 on tax and spending			1
in the key moments in last night ’s two hour , seven - way clash : miss @entity0 , a veteran of tv debates in the @entity13 referendum campaign , repeatedly left the @entity9 leader discomforted – and forced him to suggest that @entity9 is not now committed to plans to find another £ 30billion through tax rises and spending cuts , which he voted for earlier this year			1
but miss @entity0 also gave mr @entity14 and @entity93 a rough ride , saying it was time to ‘ break the old boys ’ network at @entity98 ’			1
in an early intervention , she mocked the @entity101 leaders for arguing about their future spending plans , saying : ‘ it is really interesting watching @entity14 and @entity93 attack each other , when they have been working hand in glove for the past five years			1
’ but miss @entity0 saved her main fire for mr @entity6 , scolding him for paying lip service to the need for further cuts			2
‘ @entity6 talks the language on austerity , but it ’s only a few weeks since he trooped through the lobbies to vote for £ 30billion of cuts , ’ she said			2
challenging the @entity9 leader directly , she said : ‘ we need to invest and grow our way out of austerity – why did you vote for £ 30billion of cuts ? ’ as mr @entity14 looked on smiling , mr @entity6 responded weakly : ‘ that was n’t what the vote was for			1
’ mr @entity93 ambushed the prime minister at the first opportunity after five years of @entity101 , saying : ‘ i believe you need to make the necessary cuts because you have to			1
' @entity129 and @entity14 do it because they want to			0
’ mr @entity14 retorted : ‘ i defend all our decisions – you have a pick - and - mix approach			1
’ miss @entity0 forced @entity133 to suggest that @entity9 is not now committed to plans to find another £ 30billion through tax rises and spending cuts , which he voted for earlier this year the seven leaders in the tv debate : @entity139 ( @entity140 ) , @entity93 ( @entity141 ) , @entity15 ( @entity142 ) , @entity6 ( @entity9 ) , @entity143 ( @entity144 ) , @entity0 ( @entity11 ) and @entity14 ( @entity33 ) @entity14 heckler is thrown out a female heckler was removed from the debate audience after she interrupted the prime minister			1
@entity149 , 33 , said that she wanted to challenge the ‘ 1 per cent at the top ’			2
as @entity14 tried to answer a question , the self - described ‘ wellbeing guru ’ , who was dressed in a sheepskin - style gilet , stood up and heckled			2
she called out : ‘ there ’s homeless people on the streets that have been in the services			0
’ debate moderator @entity160 tried to stop the woman , telling her : ‘ not from the audience thank you			0
’ ' i 'm sorry ' : as @entity14 tried to answer a question @entity149 , 33 , stood up and heckled him about homeless people who had served in the armed forces but she continued : ‘ i have to speak out because i ’m worried			2
at the end of the day there ’s more of us than them and they ’re not listening to us			0
’ mr @entity14 replied : ‘ the lady makes an important point that there are people who come out of our armed services who have difficulties and that ’s why we should be putting money into armed forces charities that help homeless people			1
’ during his response , she could be heard shouting : ‘ it ’s not the truth			0
’ she was then forcibly removed from the tv studio			0
on her @entity189 account she describes herself as ‘ mum , coach , artist , wellbeing guru ! ’ she has previously re-tweeted negative posts about @entity142 and mr @entity14			1
according to her internet profiles , she volunteers at a homeless project in @entity197 as well as working at a vegetarian cafe in @entity199			0
outside the studio , miss @entity149 said she had been ‘ emotionally moved by @entity14 using vulnerable people ’			0
she added : ‘ i ca n’t vote for anyone who i know is lying or omitting facts			0
that means i could n’t vote for any of the people that i saw tonight			0
’ @entity6 sent an aide to @entity197 to pick up two pairs of shoes for last night ’s debate			2
the @entity210 ’s assistant was despatched to @entity211 ’s on @entity212 in @entity197 to pick up two pairs of classic black shoes			0
she bought the @entity215 and @entity216 brands , each priced at £ 65			0
the revelation that mr @entity6 bought two pairs of shoes for one debate will add to claims he is indecisive , and comes just weeks after it emerged his house has two kitchens			2
@entity211 ’s assistant @entity224 , 22 , said : ‘ i helped his aide pick the two choices			0
they are two of our best - sellers			0
i ’ll be watching to see which one he chooses			0
