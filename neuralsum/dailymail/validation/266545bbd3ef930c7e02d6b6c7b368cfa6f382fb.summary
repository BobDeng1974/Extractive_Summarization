the @entity0 is seeking to enshrine its pledge to cut emissions in a global climate agreement to be negotiated later this year in @entity4 , formally submitting an outline of its commitment to the @entity8 yesterday			1
@entity10 leaders are warning other countries to ' proceed with caution ' in negotiations with the @entity15 administration because any deal could be later undone , however			1
president @entity15 lacks the political and legal backing to commit the @entity19 to an international agreement , they say			1
@entity10 leaders are warning other countries to ' proceed with caution ' in negotiations with the @entity15 administration because any deal could be later undone the @entity0 's tuesday announcement that the @entity19 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by close to 28 percent from 2005 levels within a decade builds on a promise @entity15 made last november in @entity27 in concert with @entity30 president @entity29			1
the two countries are the world 's largest emitters of greenhouse gasses			0
to meet its stated benchmark by 2025 , the @entity0 will rely on a host of existing laws and executive actions targeting power plants , vehicles , oil and gas production and buildings			2
' we can achieve this goal using laws that are already on the books , and it will be in place by the time the president leaves office , ' @entity43 , a senior adviser to the president , said according to the @entity51			1
@entity15 has just two years remaining in office , but many of the @entity55 's @entity10 lawmakers who oppose the initiative will remain in positions of power long after the current president has moved on			1
' considering that two - thirds of the @entity19 federal government has n't even signed off on the @entity64 and 13 states have already pledged to fight it , our international partners should proceed with caution before entering into a binding , unattainable deal , ' senate majority leader @entity60 noted on tuesday			1
the @entity69 is to take place from nov. 30 to dec. 11			0
@entity19 officials stressed that their @entity72 , @entity8 lingo for its official submission , stands on sound legal footing , with the measures drawing authority from legislation such as the @entity79 and the @entity80			2
@entity81 , the lead @entity19 climate change negotiator , said he frequently tells foreign counterparts that ' undoing the kind of regulation we are putting in place is very tough to do			2
' but elements of the administration 's climate policy already face legal challenges			0
on april 16 , a federal appeals court in @entity92 will hear arguments from 13 states opposed to as - yet - unfinalized regulations from the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) that target emissions in existing power plants			0
@entity103 's warnings echoed the tone of a march 9 ' open letter ' from 47 @entity10 senators to @entity107 , in which they warned a @entity10 president would not be bound to honor a nuclear agreement struck by @entity110 @entity15 without congressional approval , calling it a ' mere executive agreement			1
' so did @entity115 senator @entity114 's			1
@entity114 holds the position of vice chairman in the @entity118			2
' just as we witnessed throughout recent negotiations with @entity107 and during the previous climate agreement with @entity30 , president @entity15 and his administration act as if @entity119 has no role in these discussions , ' @entity114 said in a tuesday statement			1
' that ’s just flat out wrong			0
' ' we will not stand by and allow the president to unilaterally enact bad energy policies that hurt our nation ’s poorest families and young people the most , ' he said			1
the @entity0 's tuesday announcement that the @entity19 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by close to 28 percent from 2005 levels within a decade builds on a promise @entity15 made last november in @entity27 in concert with @entity30 president @entity29 some observers said that resistance to the administration 's climate policies leaves foreign governments questioning whether @entity15 's commitments can last			1
' by strenuously invoking @entity97 regulations , the @entity147 is trying to convince skeptical international audiences that the @entity19 can actually deliver on its new climate goals , despite @entity10 resistance , ' said @entity152 , a former @entity153 official who is now with the @entity154			2
' but major capitals are likely to remain nervous			0
' the administration is clearly sensitive to the threat			0
power plants are the biggest domestic source of greenhouse gas emissions , and the @entity97 is seeking to use its power to slash carbon levels from plants to 30 percent of their 2005 levels by 2020			1
on monday , epa administrator @entity166 said the agency had designed power plant rules under the authority of the @entity79 - and insisted that they can withstand @entity171 scrutiny			0
' we do n't need a plan b if we are solid on our plan a , ' she said			0
@entity175 , a lawyer representing utilities industries for @entity177 and former assistant administrator of the @entity97 under @entity179 , says even if the courts uphold the @entity97 proposal on power plants , a future @entity10 administration can reverse it			2
' there are some @entity97 rules that are very difficult for a new administration to change but this is not one of those rules , ' @entity175 said			0
he calculates that at least five high court justices are wary of the @entity97 's regulatory leeway			0
environmental groups , on the other hand , were more confident that @entity15 's measures can not be reversed by the courts or politics			0
' the @entity79 has proven to be quite durable , ' said @entity197 , director of international initiatives for the @entity199			0
' while elements may be slowed or modified by legal challenges , they are rarely overturned			0
