by @entity0 coffee connoisseurs can relax knowing their beans will be brewed in the correct way with the help of a new @entity6 app. the free app is a timer that advises people how long to brew certain types of beans , how much water to use and even when to stir the coffee			1
it lets coffee fans perfect the brewing process and then save their tweaks in the app so they can create their ideal cup again and again			1
it is largely a complex timer that walks people through the process using sound alerts the @entity22 app is designed for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy using different varieties of ground beans and waiting for their beverage - not for people who are content with adding boiling water to a teaspoon of instant coffee			1
it firstly lets people calculate the ratio of water to ground beans needed , and set times reminding them when to pour in the water			1
it can also be used to discover how long to let the mixture steep , according to its @entity55 - based creator , @entity54 , who is a graphic design student at the @entity57 to begin the process , connoisseurs need to select which type of bean they are using as well as the coarseness of the grind and the size of their cup , to work out the best coffee - to - water ratio			1
on track for the best brew : to get started , people have to enter what type of beans they are using and can save their favourites ( pictured left )			2
the app lets them create timers for each brew to use while making their cup of coffee ( right ) so that it can beep when they need to move onto the next step , ensuring precision a recent study has revealed that regardless of how precisely a person makes their coffee , the brew releases more flavour if they gulp it down			1
scientists said that taking big slurps of a coffee releases much more aroma compared to merely drinking it slowly			0
they looked at ‘ sip volume ’ when drinking coffee and found larger sips have a ‘ higher aroma release ’			0
the researchers said : ‘ the findings could be useful to understand the factors which contribute to attract consumers to the pleasant aroma of coffee			0
’ however , the advice goes against that for other drinks , such as wine , where people are advised to take small amounts in their mouth to get the maximum flavour and aroma			0
the app then generates a time for how long the process will take			2
users can set alarms to remind them when to start pouring in water and when to stir , for example			2
‘ large numbers , clear alert sounds , and a bold progress indicator make it easy to keep your attention on your coffee , ’ according to the @entity123			0
because users can customise the process for a certain type of coffee , they can explore the subtle science of getting the best out of beans and make tiny tweaks to each cup they make until they reach the perfect formula			1
' i came up with the idea for @entity22 when i was just starting to become interested in nice coffee , ' @entity54 told @entity138			2
' i was using the regular stopwatch app on my phone , but i wanted a more specialised timer that could help keep track of all the different parameters that go into a really solid cup , something that would allow me to make small tweaks and gradual improvements each time i brewed			0
' he does not think that his app will change the way people drink coffee , but he does n't want it to , as he likes the way people have personalised rituals for making a cup			2
' i hope that @entity22 can play a small part in keeping track of the details and help people find what tastes best for them , ' he said			0

a ratio for a blend of @entity178 is pictured left and a timer right ' one of my favourite things about brewing my own coffee is the eclectic collection of objects that i get to interact with , all of which fit together not because they were designed as a system , but because they were designed with a common goal			0
' i wanted to make a timer that works alongside any given brewing method , that addresses the concerns of making coffee rather than the concerns of doing so in any particular manner			0
