blackout : the range is fully encrypted by default and comes with secure features that let you make calls and send texts that are impossible to track if you ’re fed up of apps asking to access your private data and do n’t want advertisers tracking your every move , there is now a range of ‘ spy ’ phones designed to keep you off the grid			1
the original @entity16 was unveiled last year and its successor - the @entity16 2 - as well as the first ever @entity18 have been announced at this year ’s @entity19 in @entity20			1
the range is fully encrypted by default and comes with a suite of secure features that let you make calls and send texts that are impossible to eavesdrop on or track			1
@entity16 ’s @entity28 - based devices are built by @entity30 manufacturer @entity29 alongside security experts @entity31 and @entity33 ( @entity33 )			1
they launched the original handset at last year ’s @entity19 and told @entity36 that the range is for people who ‘ want to stay private without compromising on the features seen on typical @entity28 phones			1
’ everything from the custom - built @entity41 to web browsing and apps , are encrypted , or have been fitted with an extra layer of security			1
@entity46 is a so - called ‘ skin ’ that runs on top of traditional @entity28 software , meaning all @entity28 apps are compatible			1
the encryption on the @entity16 , @entity52 2 and tablet is done via the @entity31 and @entity55 privacy and security software			1
subscriptions are included for two years with each device , and they can then be renewed			0
as the firm explained : ‘ there is no bloatware , no hooks to carriers , and no leaky data			1
‘ it puts privacy in the hands of you and your [ business ] , without any sacrifices			0
’ for the @entity16 2 , this software has been upgraded to version 1.1 , designed to separate work apps from personal ones through the use of multiple profiles on the same device			1
if the phone is locked , a business can remotely lock and wipe just the enterprise profile while letting the owner take control of the private profile			2
internet access is carried out through a virtual private network ( @entity86 ) that sends and receives data in a way designed to keep it hidden			2
when the phone boots up , it asks for a password and pin before a wizard guides users through the security options			0
upgrade : @entity16 ’s @entity28 - based devices are built by @entity30 manufacturer @entity29 alongside security experts @entity31 and @entity33 ( @entity33 ) ( handset specs shown ) for example , this shows users which apps want access to which data			1
the @entity16 owner can then decide to restrict access to that information and handpick the apps and the data they share			1
@entity112 , chief architect from @entity16 told @entity36 the range was designed to have ‘ the benefit of security without having to have an in - depth knowledge of how to make a phone secure			2
’ the company said it is ' anti-personal data from the ground up ’ and added the phone will appeal to those who do n't want any data collection , those who agree with principle of collecting data and businessmen			0

when the phone boots up it asks for a password and pin before a wizard guides users through the security options			0

@entity112 , chief architect from @entity16 told @entity36 the smartphone was designed to have ‘ the benefit of security without having to have an in - depth knowledge of how to make a phone secure			2
’ with the @entity167 , in particular , the experts have teamed up with business technology and security experts such as @entity170 to make it more appealing to companies and their employees			0
the @entity167 is larger than the original with a screen size of 5.5 - inches compared to last year ’s 4.7 - inch			1
a @entity177 camera has been added to the rear , up from @entity179 , and a @entity180 is now on the front			0
the @entity167 has doubled the storage of its predecessor and added a longer battery life - although the firm did n’t give specifics			2
it will go on sale by june this year , although price details were not announced			1
last year ’s phone cost $ 629 ( £ 376 ) plus shipping and the updated version is likely to cost roughly the same amount			1
@entity31 subscriptions start at $ 12.95 ( £ 8.40 ) a month for @entity194 in 120 destinations , up to $ 39.95 ( £ 26 ) for 1,000 minutes			0
but this is included in the price of the phone or tablet			2
private : the company said it is ' anti-personal data from the ground up ’ and added the phone will appeal to those who do n't want any data collection ( original @entity16 model pictured ) the firm did n’t reveal much more information about the new flagship tablet , other than it will go on sale later this year			1
a spokesperson said it decided to launch a tablet because many people do n’t want to give up their everyday phone , but still want to have a certain level of privacy			2
‘ public awareness of the erosion of privacy has never been higher , ’ @entity220 , co-founder of @entity31 told @entity36 at this year ’s event in @entity20			1
‘ there is a rising tide of news reports of the catastrophic loss of privacy , take @entity230 or the @entity232 hack of sim keys in recent weeks			0
there are almost daily incidents of company ’s who ’ve had their company data leaked			0
‘ never before have people been aware of the excesses of pervasive surveillance from major governments			0
’ @entity243 is the @entity16 ’s core set of app that encrypts calls , texts and other communication to keep it private			1
it is available on @entity46 but can also be installed on @entity250 and @entity28			2
@entity31 subscriptions start at $ 12.95 ( £ 8.40 ) a month for @entity194 to 120 destinations , up to $ 39.95 ( £ 26 ) for 1,000 minutes			0

silent world : silent world is an encrypted calling plan that lets users communicate privately with those who do n't have @entity254			0
silent manager : silent manager gives businesses a way to privately manage plans , users and devices with ease			0
‘ a lot of android phones are tied into @entity295 who want to learn a lot about what you do			0
‘ so there are a lot of things that you do that help them track your behaviours , but on the other hand they give you features for that			0
‘ or take another example , @entity311			0
people love the features on @entity311 – but people give up their privacy in order to benefit from the features			0
that ’s built into @entity311 ’s business model			0
if you ’re not paying for the product , you are the product			0
’ although the company touts the benefits of the device there is the possibility handsets such as @entity16 will be used by criminals to hide their activity			2
addressing these concerns , mr @entity220 said : ‘ @entity330 , the famous bank robbers , almost a hundred years ago , revolutionised bank robbery by using cars to get away from the scene of the crime			0
‘ @entity336 floated the idea that cars should be required to have smaller petrol tanks			0
any new technology can be used by criminals to make their criminal activity work better for them			0
’ @entity16 ’s managing director , @entity344 told @entity36 : ‘ the availability of a tool does not create the intent for mischief			1
' if you ’re a bad guy , the fact [ @entity16 ] is making cryptography usable does n’t mean you ’re going to take that a step further ; you 're not going to become bad because of that knowledge either			2

@entity16 launched at last year ’s @entity19
@entity16 2 has a larger screen , better cameras and double storage
