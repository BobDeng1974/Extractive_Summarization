mild - mannered @entity2 was enjoying the clash between @entity9 and @entity10 last year when some of the audience at the @entity13 spotted his likeness to the son of @entity16			1
as rowdy chants of ' @entity4 ' quickly spread through the crowd packed into @entity19 at @entity20 , @entity21 , security staff were called and mr @entity2 was ejected for fear he was ruining the concentration of ex-world champ @entity9 and his @entity26 rival			1
but this year , mr @entity2 was not even allowed in - despite spending £ 450 on the return trip			1
he said he went to collect his tickets when ' two big beef - head security guards , including the head of security , dragged me into the office where they told me they would n't let me watch the darts this year			2
' i felt quite intimidated			0
the head of security told me they would not be letting me into the tournament , because they did not want a repeat of last year			1
' it 's not my fault i look like @entity4			1
i ’m not trying to look like @entity4 , i ’m not even religious - i ’m just an average @entity42			1
i have n’t done anything wrong			0
' the labourer , from @entity45 , @entity46 , has been to at least six darts events without incident since he was removed by six bouncers from last year 's tournament			2
but this year , he was told to pack his bags and be gone by 2pm			2
' we checked in , had a couple of beers with our breakfast , and then decided to go and collect the vip tickets			0
' when i got there a lady at the counter asked if i was the @entity4 bloke who came to the darts			2
' she told me she was there last year , and thought it was hilarious , especially when a bloke in a wheelchair stood up and walked in front of me			2
' up until this point , nobody had recognised me at all			0
' mr @entity2 , who has survived skin cancer twice , started growing his beard last year and keeps it long to hide scars			1
he was mobbed by fans as he left last years match , desperate for a picture with him			0
unlucky mate : darts player @entity10 gave mr @entity2 a signed programme ( right ) for his trouble denied twice : mr @entity2 was barred this week after being escorted from the venue last year ( pictured on tv ) devastated : mr @entity2 was kicked out of @entity19 , complete with his fancy dress outfit at the time he said : ' i signed a few pieces of paper - but in my real name , not @entity4			1
' in his post-match interview , @entity9 said something like " if i ever see @entity4 again , i 'll crucify him myself "			2
now that 's just hurtful			0
' @entity19 has offered the messianic lookalike a full refund , but he said he wanted compensation for missing work and buying petrol for the 280 - mile round trip			1
' @entity116 wanted me to leave as soon as possible , but obviously i did n't want to drink and drive , ' he said			0
' they made me sit in my apartment like a dog for four hours until i was certain the two beers i had had gone out of my system			0
' they were guarding my door - i felt like a criminal , and very intimidated			0
' at the end of the day , i 'm an adult and i feel they could have dealt with the situation a lot better			0
' i 'm being discriminated against because i look like the @entity131			0

' this weekend , based on his disruptive behaviour last year , both @entity19 and @entity134 , the organisers , have taken the decision not to allow mr @entity2 onto the resort			1
' this year @entity143 claimed the 2013 title , beating previous champion @entity9 11 - 7 .			0
