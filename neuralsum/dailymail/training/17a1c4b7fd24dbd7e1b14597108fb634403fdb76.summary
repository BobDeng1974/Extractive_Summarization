by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 13:34 est , 16 october 2012 updated : 03:11 est , 17 october 2012 @entity2 has begun sending out invites to a special event expected to see the launch of the @entity6 mini			1
the firm sent journalists , analysts and others a colourful invite saying ' we 've got a little more to show you '			1
the event is expected to see the unveiling of a the much anticipated ipad mini - a smaller , cheaper version of the hugely successful tablet , but could also see new @entity19 computers and even a new @entity21 computer			1
@entity2 's invite for the event expected to see the ipad mini unveiled - and it could go on sale weeks later online speculation over the gadget has been rampant , with everything from pictures to potential prices having been speculated on - despite @entity2 not even confirming next week 's event will see the launch			1
however , reports have pointed to the new device having a 7.85inch screen , compared to the 9.7 inch screen of the current @entity6			2
the timing of the event is also believed to have been carefully thought out by apple			1
invites were sent an hour after @entity39 confirmed the pricing of its surface tablet			1
the event will take place three days before @entity44 goes on sale , and a day before @entity47 's kindle fire tablet launches in the @entity48			1
the @entity49 , which has a seven inch screen , will sell for £ 159 - but @entity2 's gadget will be able to run far more apps			2
a top of the line , fully loaded ipad mini could set gadget fans back as much as £ 520 , if leaked reports are to be believed			0
a price list pictured by the site @entity60 last week appears to give the cost and details of eight different ipad mini models			0
the shot is purportedly an image of an inventory system used by @entity68 / @entity67 , which is a retail group with employees in @entity70 and @entity71			0
the inventory list notes prices for 8 , 16 , 32 , and 64 gb models with @entity75 , then a separate version of each model with integrated cellular radios for connection to mobile networks , making for a total of eight models			0
if the information is correct , the base model is € 249 ( £ 200 ) , with a cost increase of € 100 ( £ 80 ) to double the storage and an additional € 100 on top of that to add cellular			0
the most impressive model , the 64 gb with cellular , would be € 649 ( about £ 520 )			0
another leak ? this image published on @entity93 site @entity60 purports to show a price list for eight different models of @entity96 as @entity97 reported in august , @entity2 will hold a special event this month , at which it is expected to showcase the new , smaller @entity6			1
the unveiling of the @entity101 and the 2012 @entity103 line was held at @entity105 ’s @entity104 for the @entity106 , leaving people to believe that this launch will be a smaller affair			0
@entity2 's event is at the 1,122 - seat @entity111 , an opera house dating back to 1927			1
sources say the @entity6 ’s smaller sibling will feature a 7.85in liquid - crystal display and a @entity116 connector , according to @entity97			0
a leaked picture purported to show the @entity96 implies there is no rear camera on the portable device @entity2 co-founder @entity121 was apparently set against a smaller @entity6 , but relented in the months before his death last year , according to emails discussed in the @entity2 vs @entity125 patent dispute			2
during testimony during the ongoing trial , submitted court documents suggest @entity121 was tempted to enter the seven - inch market			0
he presented an email from @entity2 vice president @entity132 , who said : ' having used a @entity133 [ a seven - inch @entity134 tablet ] , i tend to agree with many of the comments below … ' i believe there will be a seven - inch market and we should do one			2
' i expressed this to @entity121 several times since @entity142 and he seemed very receptive the last time			0

sent just an hour after @entity39 confirmed pricing of its ' @entity146 tablet
invite to special event in @entity150 says ' we 've got a little more to show you '
will be *announced* three days before @entity44 goes on sale , and a day before @entity47 's kindle fire tablet launches in the @entity48
