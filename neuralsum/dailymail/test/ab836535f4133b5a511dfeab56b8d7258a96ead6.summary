congratulations to @entity1 for seeing sense and dropping the ridiculous policy of not selecting their best players if they are playing overseas			1
it leaves @entity7 looking old - fashioned and they need to react			1
@entity8 must be free to pick his best players , no matter where in the world they ply their trade			0
if @entity15 ’s star names moved to @entity16 or @entity17 , would the @entity13 tell him not to pick them ? absolutely not			0
the same needs to apply to rugby			0
@entity20 's stellar displays for @entity21 have put him back on the @entity1 radar ahead of the @entity23 the game is changing and @entity1 have realised that			1
@entity20 and @entity27 , for example , are top - class performers for @entity21 and if @entity7 lose to @entity1 with those two playing out of their skins , you know exactly what the headlines will be			1
the @entity23 is simply about the world ’s best coming together and ridiculous rules like this demean it			2
@entity21 ’s @entity37 came off the bench against @entity39 on sunday and turned the game on its head			1
his turnover work and ball - carrying are second to none and since he upped sticks to @entity47 his game has constantly improved			0
@entity21 's @entity37 takes on the @entity39 defence during the @entity50 semi-final in @entity51 i do n’t think @entity37 would be playing this well if he was still at @entity54			1
he took a big risk and it paid off , he should n’t be penalised for it			0
if one or two @entity7 back - rowers would n’t want to see @entity37 in the squad , then that confirms he should be ! @entity59 has also become better since he crossed the @entity60			1
it ’s simply wrong to say @entity7 are best served by players at @entity64 clubs			2
if someone is going to be happier , healthier and a better player overseas , he should be supported			0
@entity68 moved to @entity47 and became even better than when he played for @entity7 , so that completes the argument for me			2
would i have picked @entity68 if he was playing in @entity47 ? of course i would			0
@entity59 's game has drastically improved since the former @entity74 full back made the move to @entity47 as @entity7 coach you will be judged on your @entity23 performance , even more so as the home team			1
that ’s where you have to deliver the results and selecting your best starting xv is the first thing you have to get right , without exception			0
when it comes to the big games , the other @entity7 players will want to have the best possible squad available			1
every player , fan and @entity64 wants @entity7 to win the @entity23 and it starts with picking your best team			1
when it comes to a home @entity23 , you do n’t want to be left talking about ‘ what ifs ’			2
@entity7 head coach @entity8 has remained steadfast in his policy not to select overseas players @entity7 players deserve to go on to the field knowing they have been given the best chance of winning			1
do the squad truly believe this when such talented players are not considered ? they should n’t be left to doubt they are playing only because of their home address			0
this is n’t about being disloyal to the clubs			0
they benefit from a winning @entity7 team , especially in a @entity23 year			1
you simply ca n’t let the @entity112 or premier @entity113 tie your hands behind your back and dictate who you can or ca n’t pick			0
at @entity21 , they ’ve got @entity119 playing for @entity120 and @entity121 playing for @entity122			2
they ’re among the best players in the world			0
it ’s just crazy and misguided not to make any @entity64 available for selection			0
@entity119 plays for @entity21 but the @entity120 have continued to select the winger for @entity130 matches			2

@entity1 have seen sense by *revamping* their overseas selection policy
it leaves @entity7 looking old - fashioned and they need to react
@entity20 and @entity27 are top - class performers for @entity21
@entity37 and @entity59 should come into the selection *mix*
@entity7 need the best squad possible for the forthcoming @entity23
