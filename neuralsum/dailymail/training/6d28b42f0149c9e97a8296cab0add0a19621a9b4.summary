by @entity1 reporter published : 08:51 est , 23 august 2013 updated : 15:35 est , 23 august 2013 president @entity2 says the possible chemical weapons attack in @entity4 this week is a ' big event of grave concern ' that has hastened the timeframe for determining a @entity9 response			1
' this is something that is going to require @entity9 's attention , ' @entity2 said during an interview broadcast friday			2
@entity2 's comments on @entity4 were his first since wednesday 's alleged chemical weapons attack on the eastern suburbs of @entity17 that killed at least 100 people			1
while he appeared to signal some greater urgency for a @entity9 response , his comments were largely in line with his previous statements throughout the two - year conflict			0
the president said the notion that the @entity9 alone can end @entity4 's bloody civil war is ' overstated ' and made clear he would seek international support before taking large - scale action			1
serious decisions : president @entity2 said that he will be taking action over the attack on wednesday where chemical weapons were used ' if the @entity9 goes in and attacks another country without a @entity36 mandate and without clear evidence that can be presented , then there are questions in terms of whether international law supports it , do we have the coalition to make it work , ' he said in the interview on @entity47 's ' @entity46 ' show			1
the president said the @entity9 is still seeking conclusive evidence that chemical weapons were used this week			1
such actions , he said , would be troubling and detrimental to ' some core national interests that the @entity9 has , both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating , as well as needing to protect our allies , our bases in the region			0
' wednesday 's attack came as a @entity36 team was on the ground in @entity4 investigating earlier chemical weapons use			1
@entity2 has warned that deployment of the deadly gases would cross a ' red line , ' but the @entity9 response to the confirmed attacks earlier this year has been minimal			2
@entity69 toll : the fighting in @entity4 's bloody two - year civil war has killed an estimated 100,000 people so far parents weep as they look for their children among the dead : @entity4 's government denies launching the latest attack on wednesday and pictures show that some victims had foam coming from their mouths more than 100,000 people have been killed in @entity4 during more than two years of clashes between forces loyal to @entity4 president @entity85 and opposition fighters seeking to overthrow his regime			1
the @entity9 has long called for @entity85 to go and has sent humanitarian aid to the rebels , but those steps have failed to push the @entity4 leader from power			2
@entity2 addressed the deepening crisis in @entity4 from central @entity94 , where he is on a two - day bus tour promoting policies to make college more affordable			1
his interview with @entity47 's @entity99 covered a wide range of topics , including @entity9 's changing stance on @entity103			1
' the aid itself may not reverse what the interim government does but i think that what most @entity9 would say is that we have to be very careful about what would be seen as aiding and abetting actions that we think run contrary to our values and ideals , ' he said			0
' there 's no doubt that we ca n't return to business as usual given what 's happened , ' he said referring to the recent attacks on civilians that left hundreds dead			0
' there was a space right after mr @entity126 was removed in which we did a lot of heavy lifting and a lot of diplomatic work to try to encourage the military to move in a path of reconciliation - they did not take that opportunity			0
' turning his attention to domestic issues - both within the @entity9 and the @entity140			0
pointed : the president is currently touring @entity142 and giving a number of speeches related to the rising cost of college tuition ( seen here in @entity148 on thursday ) important siblings : hours before being interviewed by @entity47 's @entity99 , he spoke with his brother @entity151 who is the governor of @entity94 he said that he is concerned about the safeguards at the @entity153 that led to more @entity9 ' emails being read than legally allowed			2
' people are still concerned as to whether their emails are being read or if their phone calls are being listened to , ' the president said			0
documents released this week showed the @entity153 may have unintentionally collected as many as 56,000 emails of @entity9 per year between 2008 and 2011			0
a secret @entity9 court subsequently said the program may have violated @entity9 law			0
the revelations led to new questions about operations by the eavesdropping @entity153 and its oversight by the secret @entity9 @entity169 ( @entity169 )			0
@entity2 said the discovery of the mistake and the court 's demand that safeguards be improved showed the system of oversight had functioned appropriately			2
' all these safeguards , checks , audits , oversight worked , ' he said in the interview on @entity47 's ' @entity46 ' program			0
@entity2 said he was confident the @entity153 was not abusing its powers			2
' what i recognize is that we 're going to have to continue to improve the safeguards and , as technology moves forward , that means that we may be able to build technologies that give people more assurance , and we do have to do a better job of giving people confidence in how these programs work , ' he said			0
new addition : president @entity2 said that @entity198 ( right ) is faster , friskier , and a better jumper than @entity200 ( left ) the lightest topic of conversation was the new family dog , @entity198 , and president @entity2 told how @entity200 was getting lonely now that his daughters - who he referred to as the ' two other puppies ' - have grown up			1
' ( @entity206 and @entity207 ) still have some responsibilities for him but they 're not always around between school , sports practice , all that stuff , so @entity200 was starting to look a little down in the dumps , ' he said			0
' the truth is ( @entity198 's ) faster than he is , she jumps higher , she 's friskier - and he is trying to keep up			1
' right now @entity214 is in full parenting mode and really focused on getting @entity198 to sit and catch , ' but he admitted that ' there have been a few accidents ' .			1

president @entity2 gave a wide - ranging interview where he addressed foreign issues like the chemical weapons attack in @entity4 and the @entity103 government *instability*
domestically , his top priorities included initiating further safeguards at the @entity153 and house training their new family dog sunny
