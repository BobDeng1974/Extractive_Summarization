by @entity0 if you thought @entity2 was a bike - friendly city , then think again			2
each morning , the region ’s train stations become swamped with a tide of wheels and frames			2
and each evening , confused cyclists attempt to pick their way through the mass of metal in an attempt to find their ride in the crowded racks			2
now , a @entity16 duo has invented a gadget that they claim will make finding bikes easier during the daily commute			0
their device comes in the shape of a @entity28 bicycle bell which connects to a rider 's smartphone to direct them to their bike the bike bell gadget by @entity35 uses @entity36 ( @entity36 ) to connect to a user 's smartphone			1
when a cyclist parks their bike and walks away , they break the bluetooth connection to their bike and the app will automatically drop a pin on the map on their phone			1
this gives the general location of bike using @entity28			2
and with @entity36 , users can then use their phone to even more precisely locate their bike ’s position			1
in the insanity of these bike parking lots , this may still not be enough			0
so @entity35 have added the ability to remotely ring the bike bell directly from an app on the user 's smartphone			1

it even rings out loud as the rider ’s smartphone gets close – letting the owner known exactly where they parked their ride			1
@entity73 and @entity74 , who are behind the @entity2 - based design consultancy @entity35 , were able to make a fully - functional prototype of their idea in just one day			0

they then added back in custom electronics and 3d - printed parts			0
the system connects to an @entity98 via @entity36 ( @entity36 )			2
walking away after from the bike drops a pin on to the smartphone 's map , allowing gps to guide the rider back			1
‘ in the insanity of these bike parking lots , this may still not be enough as you often stand right by your bike and have difficulties spotting it , ’ the duo write on their website			0
‘ this is why we added the ability to remotely ring your bell directly from the app. this makes it easy to find your bike using your ears instead of your cluttered sense of sight			2

pictured is the interior of a prototype that was put together in 24 hours @entity73 ( pictured ) and @entity74 , who are behind the @entity2 - based design consultancy @entity35 , were able to make a fully - functional prototype of their idea in just one day from the outside , the device looks like an ordinary bike bell making it less likely to be stolen by thieves			1
‘ it was a challenge to get all the elements working in such a short time - the @entity143 as well as the hardware , ’ mr @entity73 told @entity139			0
‘ on top of that was the size			0
it was not easy to cramp all this technology inside the casing of a bell , but we managed to do so and it all functioned very well			0
’ the device is currently only a prototype and there are no plans to commercialise it			1
the chaos caused by overflowing bike racks around @entity16 train stations is set to get worse , according to a recent report by @entity16 ' railway infrastructure company , @entity162			0
around half a million people in the @entity16 currently cycle to their local train station each day , amounting to about 40 per cent of all train passengers			0

@entity177 uses @entity36 to connect to a cyclist 's smartphone
when a cyclist walks away , they break bluetooth connection to the bike
app will automatically drop a pin on map so they can later locate the ride
the bell even rings out loud as cyclist ’s smartphone gets close to location
device is currently a prototype and there are no plans to commercialise it
