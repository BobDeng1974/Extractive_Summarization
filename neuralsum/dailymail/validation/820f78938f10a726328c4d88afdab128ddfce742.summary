@entity0 hit a sublime century as @entity1 reached the @entity3 final with an imposing 95 - run victory over reigning champions @entity5 on thursday			1
the 25 - year - old hit 11 fours and two sixes as he made 105 as the co-hosts posted a daunting 328 for 7 , despite suffering a mid-over collapse			1
@entity5 ’s response never materialised and although @entity13 made a run - a - ball 65 @entity1 always looked in control with @entity16 ( 2 - 50 ) and @entity17 ( 3 - 59 ) bowling @entity5 out for 233			1
@entity0 celebrates after running out @entity19 batsman @entity18 during the @entity3 semi-final @entity16 jumps for joy after taking the wicket of @entity5 's @entity23 for 34 runs @entity16 is mobbed by his @entity1 team - mates after removing @entity19 dangerman @entity23 @entity5 pair @entity13 and @entity18 await a third umpire decision after @entity0 direct hit it was bad news for @entity18 as the third umpire ruled that he was out , sparking @entity32 celebrations @entity0 salutes the crowd at the @entity34 after reaching his century @entity0 whacks the ball for six runs during his innings of 105 from 122 balls as @entity1 set @entity5 329 to win @entity0 plays a shot during his impressive century that was the backbone of @entity1 's innings in a sport dominated by statistics there were plenty that were pointing towards a home victory with @entity5 having beaten @entity1 just once in 13 previous meetings at the @entity34			1
with the sub-continental side having continually suffered at the hands their opponents since arriving in the @entity51 in late november , @entity1 looked strong favourites			0
but @entity13 , @entity5 ’s exceptional if not a somewhat underrated leader , ensured the world champions rose to the occasion of defending their crown and the result of the semi-final was far from a foregone conclusion			0
having won the toss , it came as no surprise that @entity62 chose to bat – opting to put runs on the board and attempt to apply pressure on @entity5			0
the rejuvenated @entity19 pace attack began aggressively and the build - up of early pressure saw @entity70 lose patience and send a leading edge off @entity73 to @entity74 at cover			0
it brought @entity0 , @entity5 ’s kryptonite over the past four months , to the crease and he provided further evidence as to why many view him as the man to lead @entity1 in the near future			1
despite the pressure of the situation @entity0 never looked fazed and having weathered an early storm of short - pitched deliveries he punished one @entity73 over for four fours			1
meanwhile , at the other end @entity88 was struggling to time the ball but @entity0 ’s ability to attack and keep the run - rate rising allowed his partner to find his feet			2
after becoming just the second @entity32 player , after @entity96 , to score four successive @entity3 half - centuries @entity0 finally made his maiden @entity3 century			1
in the first over of the batting powerplay , the right - handed batsman hit three boundaries , the last a four pulled from outside off that saw him complete a 89 - ball ton			0
the match seemed to be swerving dangerously out of reach for @entity5 with their bowlers continuing to offer short - pitched balls that were being dispatched to the stands			2
but , @entity13 brought back @entity73 ( 4 - 72 ) and the eerily quiet @entity34 erupted as @entity0 attempted to hook a short ball and saw a top - edge fly to @entity23 at deep square leg for 105 off 93 - balls			2
@entity113 is clean bowled by @entity1 's @entity17 for five runs @entity16 celebrates with wicketkeeper @entity115 after combining to remove @entity74 @entity116 walks after being caught by @entity117 off the bowling of @entity119 for 45 @entity16 celebrates with @entity62 after taking the wicket of @entity74 for one run the @entity32 team look dismayed after a catch off @entity23 was refereed to the third umpire @entity5 celebrate after @entity73 took the wicket of @entity70 ( left ) for 12 run as @entity0 walked off the @entity34 the @entity19 fans were relieved to see the back of the outstanding batsman , who has plundered 921 runs in 10 innings this summer against them			1
having broken the 187 - run second - wicket partnership @entity5 looked to go on the attack but all - rounder @entity117 was equal to task , hitting three fours and a six in a quick - fire 23			2
as @entity117 departed @entity1 were faltering and @entity138 , who had grafted his way to 81 , was the next to go - caught at mid-wicket by @entity141 - having become increasingly frustrated at a succession of dot balls			2
captain @entity62 ( 10 ) quickly followed him back to the hutch with @entity145 claiming his first wicket as @entity5 slowly began to claw the match back to an even keel			0
though @entity0 , @entity138 and @entity62 were all dismissed by the short ball , the @entity19 bowlers were guilty of relying on it far too much and @entity152 and @entity17 cashed in late on to push @entity1 past 300			1
a cameo from @entity16 ( 27 not out ) took the co-hosts to 328 - 7 as @entity5 conceded 89 in the final 10 overs			1
if @entity5 were going to finally win their first match in @entity1 this summer they needed to get off to quick start			2
@entity23 was lucky not to be dismissed for a duck in the first over off @entity162 as he drove a fuller ball to @entity152 at slip only for it to be adjudged to have just fallen short			0
@entity0 watches as the ball runs away during his important innings of 105 @entity73 ( left ) and @entity167 celebrate after taking the wicket of @entity1 's @entity70 fellow opener @entity116 then enjoyed his own bit of luck as he danced down the track to @entity119 but wicketkeeper @entity115 dropped a big outside edge			1
the second lives for both batsmen was gleefully accepted and the pair put on a 76 - run first - wicket partnership as @entity5 looked to make inroads into the substantial target			0
but @entity119 soon had his man as @entity116 ( 45 ) looked to have timed his shot perfectly only to pick out @entity117 at deep extra cover			0
it was a desperately required wicket for @entity1 and three overs later @entity5 ’s star batsman @entity74 was dismissed by @entity16 for just a single			1
the 26 - year - old has scored 13 centuries in victorious chases for his country but failed to add to that in @entity34 , as he top - edged a bouncer high into the sky and straight into @entity115 ’s gloves			0
knockout matches bring about a unique pressure and the impressive @entity19 batting line - up collapsed from 76 without loss to 91 for three			0
as @entity23 was bowled - via an inside edge - by @entity16 for 34			2
in their previous seven matches in the @entity3 , at least one of @entity5 ’s top - five batsmen have scored a half - century or a hundred to anchor their side ’s innings			1
but as @entity167 departed for an 11 ball seven and @entity5 were wavering on 108 for four , the task of taking @entity5 to victory again rested on the shoulders of @entity13			0
@entity32 bowler @entity119 react as his delivery is knocked away for four runs @entity16 is mobbed by his team - mates after taking the wicket of @entity23 @entity1 captain @entity62 reflects after missing a catch but it did n't prevent their victory a packed house at the @entity34 for the showpiece semi-final occasion @entity119 celebrates after removing @entity116 ( not pictured ) for 45 runs a spout of flame marks the dismissal of @entity0 following his century @entity225 shared an important 70 - run fifth - wicket partnership with his captain before @entity162 has him caught behind off the slightest of edges on review			1
@entity0 continued to affect the outcome of the match and with the required run - rate rapidly rising , reaching over 13 with 10 overs left , as he ran - out @entity18 for 16			0
on 40 occasions in which the 33 - year - old has finished unbeaten when his side was chasing , @entity13 has taken them to triumph 38 times			0
having prodded his way to 47 off 54 balls , the @entity19 captain smashed the recalled @entity152 for successive sixes			0
paceman @entity145 ( left ) celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity62 @entity32 fans enter into the spirit of the occasion at the @entity34 @entity5 were also very well supported at the @entity34 as they continued the defence of their title but @entity13 ’s innings was eventually ended as @entity117 , with one stump to aim at , ran the @entity19 captain out 65			0
@entity5 had not lost more then seven wickets in their previous seven @entity3 matches and the previously unexposed tail were quickly dismissed			2
@entity17 bowled @entity113 ( 5 ) and @entity255 ( 0 ) in successive balls before @entity162 wrapped up the innings , bowling @entity73 for a five - ball duck , with 19 balls spare			1
@entity1 have now won all seven semi-finals they have featured in and the impressive victory has set - up a mouth - watering final against the unbeaten @entity265 in @entity266 on sunday .			1
