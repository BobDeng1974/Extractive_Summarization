if and when @entity1 finally win a game of four - day cricket , there will be no bunting , no champagne and definitely no complacency			1
so says @entity7 , who in january will become the club ’s new chief executive after nine years in charge of the @entity12 charity			1
let no one accuse him of taking the easy option			2
you have to go back to september 2012 for the last time @entity1 won a match in the @entity17 – a tense two - wicket triumph over @entity19 which spared them a third wooden spoon in four years			1
@entity7 , posing with his trophy during the @entity23 at @entity24 earlier this month ( left ) and with his mbe last year , is the new chief executive of @entity1 @entity7 is made an mbe by the queen what a heady memory that seems now			1
in the past two summers @entity1 have played 32 championship winless matches , becoming the first team since @entity32 in the 1930s to go through successive seasons without a single victory			1
the unkind view is that @entity7 will be able to use the latest batch of spoons to mix the poison in the chalice			1
but @entity1 need not be a laughing - stock : as recently as the late 1990s , they were one of the best teams in the country , and they have won three @entity45 – more than anyone			1
equally , @entity7 has not risen to the heights of chief executive at the relatively tender age of 43 without suggesting he has something about him			1
when he first broke into the highly successful @entity52 side of the mid- 1990s , averaging 46 in a team that included @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , he did so as the first @entity60 - born @entity59 cricketer to play for a county			1
now , he is the first non-white county chief executive , and there are many within the game who believe he can go all the way			2
regardless of what happens next , he has already proved himself capable of defying expectation			2
and he has not set the bar low			2
‘ i see three main elements to my job , ’ he told @entity69			0
‘ we have to make @entity1 more sustainable financially			1
we have to do a lot more to establish an emotional connect with the local community , which has n’t always happened before			0
and we need to improve standards on the field			0
poor performances are not acceptable			0
’ @entity1 has developed an unfortunate reputation as a feeder club for more prosperous rivals , particularly @entity81 , who over the past few years have gobbled up the likes of @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
in recent weeks , others have followed suit : @entity89 ( to @entity32 ) , @entity90 ( @entity91 ) and @entity92 ( @entity93 )			0
@entity7 ( right ) in his previous role of chief executive of the @entity12 , with @entity97 ceo @entity96 ( left ) and @entity99 chief @entity98 born : february 26 , 1971 @entity100 counties : @entity93 , @entity102 , @entity52 playing record ( left - handed batsman ) matches 58 @entity106 score 181 average 30.15 hundreds 5 @entity107 17 @entity109 cricket ceo @entity12 ( 2005 - 13 ) @entity1 ceo ( 2014 - ) but @entity7 believes the process can be reversed – to the extent of turning @entity1 into the leading county outside the test venues within five years			1
‘ it ’s massively ambitious , ’ he admits			0
‘ but why not ? ‘ if we become more commercially viable – through increasing our membership , hosting more events and encouraging people to use our facilities – then we can attract better players			0
there are passionate people at the club who do n’t want to settle for mediocrity			0
my job is to galvanise them and create the right environment for success			0
’ the former @entity132 test all - rounder @entity133 is set to take over as coach , while the highly regarded @entity132 seamer @entity135 has joined the club for 2015			0
there is also talk of signing @entity132 batsman @entity138			0
one way or another , there will be little shortage of @entity132 grit			0
@entity7 , pictured as a player for @entity52 in 1996 , is now ceo st struggling @entity1 ( right ) a different demographic , however , could prove more crucial to @entity1 ’s long - term success – not to mention the club ’s viability as one of 18 first - class counties who receive money each year from the @entity152 to sustain them			1
@entity153 was one of the first towns in the @entity60 in which the non-white community became the majority , and @entity7 regards it as his job to find out why more of the large south @entity59 population has not been snapped up by the cricket team			1
‘ we have to create an emotional connection with them , ’ he says			0
‘ lots of county age - group sides all round the country contain a high percentage of non-white players , yet there is a relatively low percentage of them in first - class cricket			2
there is clearly some blockage somewhere , and that is not specific to @entity1			1
@entity7 ( middle row , third left ) in @entity52 's 1996 team photo with @entity56 ( back centre ) and @entity180 ‘ but hopefully , as someone who grew up within that community if you like , i can help break those down			1
when you speak to the south @entity59 community , the message is that they do n’t feel welcome , that @entity1 is not their club			2
there has been some truth in that , but it to be a two - way process			0
it ca n’t all be take , take , take			0
‘ i want to get into @entity153 and find out what exactly the issues have been			0
hopefully they might look at me and think that there is an opportunity in cricket for @entity60 - born @entity59			0
’ it is an area in which @entity1 have the potential to lead the way			2
if @entity7 gets it right , the whole of @entity205 cricket will be in his debt .			2

@entity1 have not won a championship match for two years
@entity7 was made an mbe at @entity212 in 2013
he played for @entity52 in the mid- 1990s , first @entity214 at a county
