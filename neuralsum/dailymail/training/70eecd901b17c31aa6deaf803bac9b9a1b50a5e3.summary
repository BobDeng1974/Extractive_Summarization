local people on the holiday island referred to @entity34 and @entity1 as the ‘ @entity35 of @entity4			2
’ that was the impression the pair gave to the farming community who toiled for £ 1 a day in the fields surrounding their luxury three - bedroom villa with its large swimming pool and marble floors			0
but the couple , who locals said were too ‘ high and mighty ’ to talk to them , were shocked when drug squad officers raided their home and allegedly found two small packets of cocaine			1
