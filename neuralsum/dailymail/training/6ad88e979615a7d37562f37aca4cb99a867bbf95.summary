by @entity0 @entity1 admits that if she had the money she would go to an @entity4 plastic surgeon and get ' the lot ' @entity1 is looking down at her chest in faux disgust			1
' i want my boobs done , ' she says , cupping them			1
' but i just want them lifted a bit , not implants , and i do n't think they do that			2
and i 'd have my thighs tightened because all the muscle and skin tone 's gone			1
' and i 'd have the cellulite shlooshed out of my tummy			2
and i 'd have that wattle thing done , under my neck			2
' oh yes , and hair implants – maybe a hair transplant			2
if i had the money , i 'd go to the best plastic surgeon in @entity4 and have the lot			2
i look all right in my clothes , but underneath i 'm a melted candle			1
you would n't want to go there ... ' it 's fair to say that @entity1 is n't quite as i 'd expected			1
she looks just like the cool , composed , very middle - class @entity34 from @entity36 , or @entity38 ' tough @entity37 , or even @entity39 from @entity40 – all sleek , beautifully fitting clothes , discreet jewellery and immaculate skin			2
but actually she 's warm , funny , surprisingly open and brilliantly messy			1
' do you want to see the inside of my bag ? ' she says , grabbing an enormous soft leather tote			2
' look ! there 's sand , sweets , salt sachets , pens , drinks , packets of crisps , @entity56 , plasters			1
i like to be prepared and i know most things i need for all eventualities are there			2
' which is all very interesting , but we 're actually here to talk about @entity64 – a new @entity66 drama series set in a field hospital in @entity68 in the @entity69 , but filmed in the @entity70			1
@entity1 , who 's long been fascinated by the war and in her 20s made pilgrimages to the @entity68 battlefields , plays stern but compassionate @entity75			1
' it was very emotional			2
that level of loss – what must it have done to those poor men ? to be a good nurse you 'd have to have a level of detachment			2
i 'd just want to take them home with me			2
my mother 's a nurse , but i could n't do it			1
' the cast of cold feet - back row , from left , @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			2
front row - @entity1 , @entity97 , @entity98 her mother sounds more capable than most , single - handedly raising four children after her husband walked out when @entity1 was just four			1
' i do n't know why he left – but i would imagine there was someone else involved , knowing my dad			2
there were four of us under six			2
it was really hard for my mum			0
' and her dad – what was he like ? ' great fun , naughty , charismatic , twinkly ... trouble			0
i saw him every sunday			0
he was good at gifts and going out for nice meals but not the sort of man you should marry			0
' he died when @entity1 was 21			1
' it had a profound impact			0
it was really , really difficult			0
it was like the removal of a limb			0
' so @entity1 immersed herself in work			1
' suddenly i was at @entity128 , sharing a dressing room with a woman who drank gin out of the bottle and went on and on about her cats			0
' ' if i had the money , i 'd go to the best plastic surgeon in @entity4 and have the lot			0
i look all right in my clothes , but underneath i 'm a melted candle			1
you would n't want to go there ... ' for years she alternated between theatre and anything that paid the bills – walking around shopping centres in a moose outfit and selling double glazing			0
until , in 1997 , she was cast in @entity36 , the cult @entity147 drama co-starring @entity94 , @entity93 , @entity98 , @entity97 and @entity95			1
the show ran for five series and served as a launch pad for its stars , who at one stage were reputed to be being paid £ 70,000 each an episode			0
( she looks a bit blank when i mention the money today , as well she might after saying last month she now shops at @entity159 because @entity161 tv pays such meagre wages			0
) much has been made of the differences between the cast over the years – so did they get on at all ? ' we were a very eclectic group , ' is her careful answer			0
' a really different bunch of people			0
' are any of them still friends ? ' i 'm godmother to @entity93 's little girl			1
and i worked with @entity97 recently			0
and @entity175 's been away in @entity176 doing @entity177 ... with @entity175 you always knew			1
i remember a helicopter arriving on set to pick him up , and @entity93 saying , " oh look , there 's @entity175 's career taking off , " as the rest of us got into a minibus			1
' which brings us neatly back to hair transplants and , in passing , @entity94 's very natural - looking new thatch			1
@entity1 as @entity37 and @entity192 as @entity193 in @entity38 ' @entity175 is amazing			1
you 've got to have the cash to do it really , really well			0
i 'm so pleased for him			0
as an actor it makes a difference to your castability as well			0
' so what about @entity202 ? ' i would ... ' and has she ? ' i 'm not telling you ! if you have surgery , do n't speak about it			0
but i 'm not against it , obviously			0
' it 's ironic that while she played the wife with children in @entity36 , @entity1 was the last of the cast to settle down			1
for years , she found herself attracted to charming but unsuitable men – not unlike her father			0
then in 2002 , at the age of 35 , she met @entity215 , a writer and tv producer , when she was filming @entity40 with @entity217			0
they married the same year and now have a son , @entity220 , nine , and daughter , hero , six			0
' i just thought , " oh * * * * it 's you ! " it was very straightforward			1
he 's kind , bright , my best friend			1
' at 40 , he 's also seven years younger than her			1
is she conscious of the age gap ? ' i 'm sure as i get older i will be			0
i need that work done ! ' the family live in @entity232 and , between filming commitments , spend their time watching mostly @entity4 dvd box sets			0
' i 'd absolutely love to be in an @entity4 drama , but i could n't go over there and peddle my wares , ' she says			1
' i 'd want them to come to me and just offer me an amazing part			0
i 'd never have to work again and i 'd be able to get my plastic surgery done then			0
i reckon i 'd need about a quarter of a million			0
she may have a tendency to play dauntingly capable women but she 's great company			1
and you never know , one day , if @entity246 does finally come calling she might end up looking rather different			0
' i 'd see you in a few months and my boobs would be up here and i 'd look amazing ! ' let 's just hope she leaves the hair transplants to @entity94			1
the @entity64 starts tomorrow at 9pm on @entity66 .			1

@entity1 opens up about how she 's *unhappy* about her body
she says her naked body looks like a ' melted candle '
the *actress* will star in a new @entity66 war drama *debuting* tomorrow night
