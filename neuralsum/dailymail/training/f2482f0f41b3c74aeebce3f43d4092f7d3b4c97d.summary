@entity0 are not suddenly favourites to regain the @entity2 next summer			1
they are not favourites to beat @entity6 in the @entity7 soon after that , nor to win in @entity9 in 2015 - 16			0
but , after going 1 - 0 down to @entity11 at @entity12 , they won the next three tests as if they were playing the @entity15 2nd xi. for the time being they can take real pleasure in the transformation			1
not all the problems have suddenly been solved			1
@entity21 ’s three half - centuries in four innings needed generous helpings of luck			1
we do n’t yet know how @entity27 will fare if the ball does n’t swing			0
and @entity29 could do with some runs			1
@entity31 moment : @entity0 's players soak @entity34 after victory at @entity36 but @entity0 deserve a slap on the back , not least for making @entity11 look that awful			1
the selectors stuck with @entity40 and @entity41 , who finished the series with 10 wickets at 22 , and @entity45 never considered sacking @entity21			1
at two points this summer , @entity45 may have wavered – for @entity21 himself certainly did , dissuaded from resignation by his wife , @entity48			1
the first nadir was on the fourth evening at @entity50 , after @entity0 had blown a near - impregnable position against @entity52			1
the second was the @entity55 ’s defeat by @entity11			1
both results were freakish in their own way			0
@entity0 may never again lose a home test to @entity52 after leading by over 100 on first innings			1
and they may never again be outbowled by @entity61 seamers on a greentop			0
but the defeats said plenty about the post-ashes state of mind , which veered between denial and despondency			0
that @entity45 stuck with @entity21 may tell us something about his own stubbornness – a quality the two men evidently share			2
both will be quietly thanking their genetic make - up now			0
and yet both will know how much they owe to their new - ball pairing			0
at @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity36 , @entity76 and @entity77 shared 28 wickets at 13 apiece while conceding 2.2 an over			1
both men were at their best : @entity76 was snakingly word - perfect , darting it this way and that , with no discernible change of grip ; @entity77 was remorselessly malevolent , despite only one good knee and a broken nose			1
they would have troubled better sides than @entity11			2
even so , the @entity94 axis gives @entity11 an easy get - out clause : they can say they were beaten by @entity99 seamers in @entity99 conditions			2
inconveniently , @entity29 claimed 19 wickets at 23			2
since @entity103 and @entity104 claimed 12 between them at 43 , @entity99 spin has trumped @entity61 spin for the second @entity108 series in a row – and this time without @entity110 or @entity111			2
as much as anything , it was @entity11 ’s laziness against @entity29 that summed up their approach			1
every time they tried to break free of @entity0 ’s half - @entity121 , the sense of strangulation grew			2
by the end , we were just hearing the same old tropes from @entity125			0
bowling them over : @entity76 ( left ) and @entity77 combined to devastating effect getting the job done : @entity129 ( left ) celebrates reaching his hundred at @entity36 @entity131 and @entity76 thrilled with win for more cricket - related snippets , feel free to go to twitter.com / the_topspin after @entity0 won in @entity11 in 2012 - 13 , @entity125 was asked if the result represented a low point			1
no , he said : that was the 2007 @entity139 , a comment that seemed indicative of @entity11 ’s priorities			2
yet when the question was put to him again on sunday , he instead cited as his personal nadir @entity11 ’s 4 - 0 defeat in @entity0 in 2011			1
but then , in test cricket , he is collecting plenty of options			1
there were moments in this series when @entity125 fought hard with the bat , attempting to overcome a homespun technique and the deficiencies of his team - mates			2
but it remains a mystery , for which opponents are thankful , that he is still @entity11 ’s @entity108 captain			2
his decision to go on the defensive as early as the second session at @entity78 felt like a surrender , as if he had forgotten the series consisted of five tests , not three			0
his bowling changes were frequently weird			0
and he spoke enigmatically of the importance of ‘ processes ’ , while waving a regal hand in the direction of mere ‘ results ’			0
picture of misery : the @entity11 team after the final @entity108 loss capped a woeful second half of the series on sunday evening , after acknowledging the suggestion that @entity11 ’s players might benefit from a stint in county cricket , he was asked whether @entity181 would ever consider sacrificing the @entity182 for a spell with a shire			1
his answer came with a familiar passive - aggressive grin : ‘ you ’ll have to ask @entity188			2
do n’t be too jealous of @entity182			0
’ it was a revealing response , for the question had conveyed no jealousy			0
@entity125 is said to earn $ 30million a year			0
perhaps that ’s what he had in mind			0
alas , no amount of money could buy runs for @entity198 and @entity181 , and here we can finish with one final contrast			0
while those two – perhaps the most feted pair of young batsmen in the world game – scraped together one half - century in 20 innings , the eminently less glamorous couple of @entity34 and @entity129 managed four hundreds and five fifties from 14 innings			0
it does n’t matter how much you earn or how sexy your cover - drive looks or even how much you scream in the face of vanquished batsmen			0
it matters how much you ’re prepared to scrap			0
@entity0 lost 5 - 0 not so long ago			2
but at least @entity99 cricket , finally , was honest with itself			0
feted : but no amount of money could buy @entity181 runs in @entity0 @entity221 the wonder of @entity223 one of the most intriguing aspects of @entity11 ’s meltdown were the logical contortions @entity227 would find himself in each night on @entity229 ’s verdict show			1
@entity227 has based his post-cricket career on clinging on to the @entity188 ’s greasy pole			1
it allows him many privileges but demands strict loyalty			0
asked by @entity235 on sunday whether @entity125 would have to consider his position , @entity227 replied that this would only occur if @entity11 were badly beaten by @entity0 at home			1
what he can only have meant was ‘ badly beaten by @entity0 at home twice ’ – unless he feels a 10 - wicket defeat at @entity241 followed by a seven - wicket loss at @entity243 do n’t quite fit the bill			1
still , greasy poles can be tricky beggars ... @entity108 cricket @entity248 believes @entity252 ‘ stakes a huge claim to be selected in all three formats ’			1
even though @entity248 ’s point comes with the caveat that he probably has the same view of his own batting , he is right			0
@entity0 have five tests left before their next tilt at the @entity2 – three in the @entity259 , two at home against @entity261			2
and they should consider the course of action the @entity264 would least like them to take			0
whirlwind : @entity252 could be @entity0 's match - winner at the top of the order in test cricket @entity25 is a determined player with serious limitations			1
it ’s hard to see him winning you a test match			0
but @entity252 , who is finally on the brink of his one - day international debut , has the potential to be @entity0 ’s answer to @entity278 – a hit - and - miss top - order whirlwind who can win you a game if he bats two sessions			1
@entity0 have taken the plunge with @entity285 , and nobody died			2
they can do the same with @entity252			2
elegant and effortless farewell , then , @entity288 , a batsman of aching elegance whose 11,814 @entity108 runs at a fraction under 50 would have qualified him for even more superlatives had he played for one of the sport ’s superpowers			1
as it was , there could sometimes be a hint of condescension when it came to his place in the pantheon – bracketed below @entity303 , or alongside @entity304 , when in fact he deserved a place all of his own			0
waving goodbye : @entity288 is chaired off by his @entity52 team - mates after his final test @entity288 ’s reputation as a gentleman was exaggerated			1
though less obviously prickly than @entity311 , he was rarely less than flinty , and in a press conference at @entity313 in june needed no invitation to dance on @entity0 ’s grave			2
but it was his batting we ’ll remember : effortless , second - gear , 30 - on - the - board - before - you ’ve - blinked			0
and , yes , an all - time great			0
the women trip up earlier this year at the @entity0 team dinner in the @entity55 ’s @entity325 , it was as if the 5 - 0 @entity2 disaster had never happened			1
the focus , instead , was on the women , who had retained their urn thanks mainly to a memorable @entity108 win at @entity331			0
now they have just lost a home test to @entity11			1
witnesses say it did not make for encouraging viewing			0
the @entity188 have virtually ignored women ’s cricket , while the @entity337 have invested plenty			1
this was as bad as it gets .			0

not all @entity0 's problems have been solved but they made @entity11 look awful
@entity21 owes a lot to @entity76 and @entity77
@entity11 's series can be summed up by their laziness against @entity29
@entity227 is still clinging on to the @entity188 's greasy pole
@entity252 can be @entity0 's @entity278 in test cricket
farewell to the elegant and effortless @entity288
@entity0 women 's defeat by @entity11 was as bad as it gets
