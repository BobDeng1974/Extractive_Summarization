a pregnant mother with a rare form of dwarfism has revealed the physical challenges of raising her three - year - old son - who is more than half her size - while preparing for the arrival of her second child			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , was born with diastrophic dysplasia and underwent numerous limb - lengthening surgeries as a child so she would grow to be 4 ' 10 tall , instead of her previous height of 3 ' 8 , which is how tall her son @entity15 currently is			1
but even with the additional inches , parenting a rambunctious toddler can be difficult for the 34 - year - old mom who has certain physical limitations , and often has to use crutches , or sometimes a wheelchair , in addition to being three months pregnant			1
' @entity15 is a typical kid – he wants to do what he wants to do , ' she told people of her son			1
' and chasing him outside or across the street is not an option for me			0
' helping hand : @entity8 , who has diastrophic dysplasia , a rare form of dwarfism , can be seen grocery shopping with her three - year - old son @entity36 , who is more than half her size , but always willing to assist her making it work : the 34 - year - old mom from @entity9 , @entity10 , is 4 ' 10 tall and is constantly re-teaching herself to walk because of the stiff muscles and arthritis , which are side effects of her dwarfism @entity8 , who married to @entity45 , a 6 ’ 1 , 29 - year - old @entity44 who is 6 ' 0 , explained that she has to get creative when it comes to dealing with her son - especially when he throws himself on the floor and cries			1
when tantrums occurs she will walk way and say : ' @entity51 ca n't help when you 're yelling at me ... no crying and @entity51 can help			0
' @entity8 noted that this trick , which she has developed over time , usually prompts her son to get up and give her a hug			2
' i try my best to let him know throwing tantrums does n't get you very far - a great lesson to learn , do n't you think ? ' she said			0
great news : @entity8 and her husband @entity45 , a 29 - year - old @entity44 , are expecting their second child in september all smiles : @entity15 happily cuddled up to his dad for this snapshot full of life : the three - year - old had a laugh while his dad @entity73 enjoyed his breakfast @entity8 , who co-wrote the memoir dwarf with @entity76 , has difficulty lifting @entity15 now that is getting taller because her arms are significantly shorter than most moms			1
the stiff muscles and arthritis that are side effects of her condition mean that she has to constantly re-teach herself how to walk - which makes chasing after @entity15 impossible			2
losing control of her son is one of her greatest fears , which is why she avoids leaving the house with @entity15 when she does n’t her husband @entity73 or another family member by her side			1
' i have even watched @entity73 struggle to catch him outside and he 's a @entity44 ! ' she explained			0
‘ we named @entity15 correctly , because he 's almost too speedy and too athletic			0
' because she ' would n't stand a chance ' against outracing her son , she makes sure she stays ' 10 steps ahead of the game ' at all times			0
overcoming obstacles : @entity8 can be seen as a child wearing braces on her legs			2
she underwent numerous limb - lengthening surgeries when she was younger painful choice : @entity8 was expected to be 3 ' 8 tall , but her surgeries allowed her to grow to 4 ' 10 , enabling her to be more independent @entity8 recalled times in which @entity15 has climbed into the dryer or wedged himself behind the couch or plopped himself inside the sink			1
without physically being able to get him out on her own , she has to rely on her own quick thinking , as well as game she made up to ensure his cooperation			0
she explained that when she sings : ' one , two , three , help me ! ' and reaches out for @entity15 , he will take her hands and pull himself up and out of whatever precarious situation he has gotten himself into			0
@entity15 's willingness to lend his mom a helping hand is one of the reasons she is confident that he will be a fantastic big brother			2
' he really is - whether he is intentionally doing so or no - becoming my little helper , ' she said			0
' we conquer the day - to - day challenges together , and i hope we always do			0
