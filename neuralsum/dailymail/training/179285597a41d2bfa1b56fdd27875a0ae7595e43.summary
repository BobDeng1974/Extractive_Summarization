by @entity0 for @entity1 a woman has run up £ 40,000 worth of debt and had to move back in with her mother - in - law - all because of a shopping addiction			1
@entity6 , 41 , started shopping as a teenager with her mother and became used to getting what she wanted			1
her habit spiralled out of control when she was suffering with severe depression in 2011 and she was spending up to £ 2,000 shopping for clothes , bags and shoes online			1
but the equity they got back on the house did not even begin to cover the £ 40,000 debts @entity6 had racked up			1
now they are starting to clear the debt and @entity6 is working hard to keep her shopping addiction under control			1
the office worker said : ' people do n't take shopping addictions seriously - they just think it 's as easy as stopping spending			2
' i would try and ask myself if i really needed what i was buying , but i always managed to justify it			2
' it 's so hard to quit because you ca n't just go cold turkey			0
i will always need to buy things			0
' i have a passion for fashion so a lot of my money went on clothes and shoes			0
i would wear them once and then the novelty would have worn off			0
' @entity6 was the youngest child of three by a long way and her mother would take her shopping to help her daughter deal with bullying at school			1
she said : ' my mum spoiled me			0
i got everything i wanted			0
@entity6 says her shopping problem began in childhood , when her mother would use buying things as a way of comforting her over the bullying she experienced at school @entity6 says she was unable to stop herself spending , and that people realise that it is a real addiction ' i ca n't blame her for the debt i got myself in , but she did n't help			1
she had bad money habits herself and i followed her example			0
' when @entity6 was 24 her mother died of breast cancer			1
a year later her father remarried but it put a strain on relations within the home and @entity6 moved in with @entity26			1
with a mortgage to pay , @entity6 's shopping habits did not change , and when the couple married in 2005 they paid for both the wedding and honeymoon mostly with credit cards			1
@entity6 was forced to sell her home to re-pay some of the money , but is still deeply in debt @entity6 said : ' the country was in a boom			1
credit was easy to get and we were always getting letters through about new cards with zero per cent interest			0
' we would get a lot of credit card statements but would n't think much about it			0
i have no idea it got up to over the years because we were would put it onto the mortgage			0
' it built up more and more and @entity26 was getting increasingly stressed about it			0
i continued to pretend it was n't happening and he wanted me to realise i had a problem on my own			0
' in 2011 the couple had a trial separation			0
@entity6 had recently been diagnosed with depression and during this time her condition got worse			1
she was shopping in an attempt to make herself feel better and was racking up bills of £ 2,000 almost every month			1
@entity6 said : ' i would order online so it did n't really feel like i was even shopping			1
' i would buy things in every colour and then return a lot of them			0
i was telling @entity26 that it 's not as bad as it seemed on the credit card statements because it had n't included the things i had returned			0
' my husband told me that if we worked on my problems we could give the marriage another go			2
' we decided to sell the house and move in with his parents			2
' although it was only intended to be a short - term solution , the couple have now been living in the house for two years			2
@entity6 said : ' the house did n't sell for as much as we thought it would and one thing after another always comes up			1
' the credit cards want huge interest so by the time we 've paid that each month we 're barely making a dent in the debt			2
' i am working on my problem though and have seen a therapist			2
we are making progress , it 's just very slow			0
