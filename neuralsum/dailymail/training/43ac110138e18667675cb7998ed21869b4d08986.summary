with the death of his six - year - old daughter , @entity1 , @entity3 had suffered a year of heartache and loss , one that will take him many more to get over			2
so the web designer from @entity8 , @entity9 , was ill - prepared to have that grief dragged up again when he logged on to @entity11 to discover a picture of her , with the cheery message : ' @entity3 , here 's what your year looked like			1
' mr @entity3 was just one of a number of the social network 's users stunned as a new feature brought them face - to - face with dead loved ones by offering them a selection of their highlights of the year			1
insensitive : @entity11 's @entity29 feature brought some users face - to - face with bad memories of 2014 unleashed just before @entity32 , @entity11 's @entity29 feature sorts photos automatically from users ' profiles , selecting those which had provoked the most responses as ' highlights '			1
for a number of users , the choices brought back unpleasant memories			2
mr @entity3 wrote on his blog , @entity44 , how , following his daughter @entity1 's death , he had not felt inclined to see his @entity11 ' @entity47 ' , despite seeing his friends ' slideshows popping up in his news feed			1
then he logged in to the social network shortly before @entity32 to find it exhorting him directly to make one of his own			0
it was decorated with a picture of his late daughter , staring straight at him from the screen			0
' yes , my year looked like that			0
my year looked like the now - absent face of my little girl			2
it was still unkind to remind me so forcefully , ' he wrote			0
when a pet dies , or a @entity11 user posts about bad news , clicking the like button to express sympathy does n’t feel quite right			1
so , with this in mind , the social network is said to be thinking of alternative ways for its members to show they care , without appearing tactless or insensitive			0
it could help to avoid future gaffes like those bumbled into by @entity11 's @entity29 , by giving algorithms a more nuanced understanding of why users have interacted with a post			1
@entity11 tycoon @entity82 , pictured top right , admitted he is working on a dislike button - but it is unlikely to be called dislike			1
speaking at the firm ’s offices in @entity89 , mr @entity82 said : ‘ we need to figure out the right way to do it so [ the button ] ends up being a force for good , not a force for bad			0
’ he continued that people could use a button designed to express negative sentiment in the ‘ wrong way ’ , that could be deemed cruel or mean			0
however , when such a button will be introduced is not known , and the site has been talking about the feature since 2010			0
conceding it was not a ' deliberate assault ' , but a perverse outcome of @entity11 's automation , mr @entity3 nevertheless called the incident ' jarring '			1
' this inadvertent algorithmic cruelty is the result of code that works in the overwhelming majority of cases , reminding people of the awesomeness of their years , showing them selfies at a party or whale spouts from sailing boats or the marina outside their vacation house , ' he wrote			0
' but for those of us who lived through the death of loved ones , or spent extended time in the hospital , or were hit by divorce or losing a job or any one of a hundred crises , we might not want another look at this past year			0
' after mr @entity3 's blog post went viral , @entity129 , product manager for @entity11 , emailed him to apologise			1
mr @entity129 told the @entity131 : ' [ the app ] was awesome for a lot of people , but clearly in this [ mr @entity3 's ] case we brought him grief rather than joy			2
' mr @entity3 was not the only @entity11 user to face grief rather than joy in the social network 's offer of a @entity29			1
@entity143 - based advertising copywriter @entity142 revealed on @entity144 how @entity11 had automatically selected a picture of his dead father 's ashes to entice him to see his @entity47			1
it was tastefully framed by a picture of a group of stick men who appeared to be dancing			0
@entity151 , a @entity144 user from @entity152 , wrote : ' i 'm so glad that @entity11 made my ' year in @entity29 ' image a picture of my now dead dog			1
i totally wanted to sob uncontrollably this @entity157			0
' and @entity158 from @entity159 wrote on @entity144 how she had been confronted with her dead grandparents			2
the 31 - year - old , who would only give her first name , told @entity163 came up with a photo i 'd posted following my @entity166 's unexpected passing recently			2
' it struck me as ill - considered , because their algorithm clearly ca n't distinguish why an image has been used - deceased relative , missing child , images taken following accidents or assaults - all things i 've seen posted on @entity11 this year which are hardly things you want to remember			1
' tech : a @entity11 worker waits for friends to arrive outside @entity11 headquarters in @entity182 , @entity89 mr @entity3 , a web designer , also had a nuanced critique of the potential pitfalls posed by @entity11 's @entity29 , blaming it on the fact that ' algorithms are essentially thoughtless '			1
he added : ' where the human aspect fell short , at least with @entity11 , was in not providing a way to opt out			2
the @entity47 in review ad keeps coming up in my feed , rotating through different fun - and - fabulous backgrounds , as if celebrating a death , and there is no obvious way to stop it			0
' in a subsequent blog post however , mr @entity3 issued his own apology to @entity11 and mr @entity129 , @entity29 's product manager , for singling them out for a problem which affects many other online services			2
' i am very sorry that i dropped the internet on [ mr @entity129 's ] head for @entity32			0
he and his team did n’t deserve it , ' mr @entity3 wrote .			0

users came face - to - face with dead children , grandparents and family pets
their photographs were framed by clip art - style scenes of parties
@entity11 's algorithms simply choose the posts with the most interaction
