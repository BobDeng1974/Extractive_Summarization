by @entity0 many people have wondered why animals tend to avoid grazing on land near high voltage electricity pylons and power cables			0
and now scientists believe they have solved the mystery by finding that flashing uv light that is undetectable to humans probably scares creatures including reindeer away			1
power lines give off ultraviolet light as irregular flashes at insulators and as a ‘ standing corona ’ - a halo of gas - along the cables that can be seen by birds and some mammals			1
the subject of animals being forced to avoid cables because they are frightened is particularly controversial in @entity28 countries because of demands that power lines should be located away from wild and semi-domesticated reindeer ( pictured ) scientists are not sure why some animals can see ultraviolet light and others ca n't			1
it is thought that some use it to see in the dark as well as spotting potential mates or predators			0
reindeer for example see uv light and it helps them spot polar bears that appear to be incredibly well camouflaged in white snow			1
bees and other insects use their @entity49 vision to see colours and patterns on plants			0
rodents use it to follow trails of urine , but they are not sure what pets use it for			0
experts also question why human eyes filter out uv light			2
some think it could be to protect the delicate retina , but other animals that live for a long time and see @entity49 do not have damaged eyes			0
other scientists consider that the human eye is best suited to seeing detailed images in low levels of light , whereas other creatures that see uv tend to see in less detail			1
it is thought that reindeer see the uv range as the @entity78 is rich in uv light and it might even help them spot polar bears			1
a recent study found that around 35 species of animals , including cats and dogs , can see light that humans can not			2
scientists from @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 of @entity93 and the @entity94 in @entity93 investigated the phenomenon to investigate whether pylons have detrimental effects on populations of reindeer			1
the mystery of mammals and birds avoiding high voltage power lines has been recognised for some time but had puzzled scientists because suspended cables are neither a barrier to wildlife nor are regularly associated with humans			1
the subject of animals being forced to avoid cables is particularly controversial in @entity28 countries because of demands that power lines should be located away from wild and semi-domesticated reindeer - the latter herded by indigenous @entity117 people who depend on the animals			1
populations of wild reindeer in @entity93 can sometimes fragment because they ‘ can not ’ roam freely because of power lines , leading to the creation of 23 distinct herds in southern @entity93 , @entity119 reported			1
professor @entity123 of @entity89 , said : ‘ new information about animal vision along with the characteristics of power lines , provides strong evidence that the avoidance may be linked with animals ’ ability to detect ultraviolet flashing on power lines that humans can not see and which they find frightening			1
’ by choosing to avoid power lines , animals such as reindeer face disruption of migration and substantial loss of grazing land			1
this can affect the growth and genetic variability of populations			0
for reindeer in particular it influences the wellbeing of herds and of herders who rely on the animals for their livelihoods , cultural identity and food , the experts said			2
the effect may be more pronounced in snowy areas where the ultraviolet light is reflected and scattered by snow , they explained			0
in dark @entity78 winters , the team argues , power lines do not appear to reindeer merely as impassive , grey structures but rather as lines of flashing lights stretching across the terrain			1
high voltage power cables can cause a build - up of ionised gas that means they have a ultraviolet glow as well as occasional bursts of light			2
power companies work hard to stop such bursts because they cause power leakage , but it is almost impossible to eliminate them			0
scientists think that the uv filter in the human eye means that we can see more accurately than without it			2
humans can see in such detail because we have dense colour - sensitive cells ( cones ) in the retina ( pictured ) that convert light to create detailed images in dim conditions @entity191 researchers found that a whole plethora of mammals , including dogs , cats , hedgehogs and ferrets can see in uv , giving them a better view at night among other benefits			1
it was previously thought that only a handful of mammals could see ultraviolet light , but the new study could help scientists shed some light on why pets behave the way they do			0
@entity209 , a biologist at @entity210 , in @entity208 told @entity211 : ‘ nobody ever thought these animals could see in ultraviolet , but in fact , they do			0
’ light is made up of a spectrum of colours and humans can see from red to violet , whereas many animals , such as bees , fish , reptiles and amphibians can see ultraviolet wavelengths invisible to humans			0
a number of mammals including bats , reindeer and some mice and moles are already known to see in ultraviolet , but scientists are not sure why some animals have it and others , as well as humans , do not			2
the lens of the human eye blocks ultraviolet light , but in some animals uv can reach the retina and the light is converted into nerve signals , which travel to the brain and are processed			0
to explore which animals possess the capability to see ultraviolet light , the researchers obtained eyes from a wide array of mammals that had died in zoos , vets , science labs or slaughterhouses			0
they measured how much light got through each animal ’s eye to the retina			0
scientists found that many of the animals , including cats , dogs , hedgehogs , ferrets and okapi , have lenses that let some ultraviolet light though , suggesting that they can see well in the dark			2
scientists already know that bees and other insects use their @entity49 vision to see colours and patterns on plants , while rodents use it to follow trails of urine , but they are not sure what pets use it for .			0

scientists from @entity89 found that the uv flashes can cause the fragmentation of reindeer populations in @entity93
the light can not be seen by humans but is believed to break up herds of wild reindeer that are frightened of glowing power lines
