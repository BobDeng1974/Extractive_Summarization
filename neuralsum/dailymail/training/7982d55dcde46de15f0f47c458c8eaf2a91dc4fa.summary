on friday , @entity0 will become the first driver to participate in a @entity3 grand prix weekend in over two decades , and @entity4 believes it as a ' massive step forward ' for the sport			1
@entity0 , the 31 - year - old development driver at @entity4 , will take part in friday 's opening practice session for the @entity11 @entity10 - the 50th edition at @entity14 - replacing @entity13			1
' for @entity3 as a whole it sends out a really powerful message , ' @entity4 , the @entity11 team 's deputy team principal , said			2
i think @entity0 has proved herself to be a great role model			2
she has got here on merit and it will be fantastic to see what tomorrow brings for her , but also for the future of @entity3			0
' it is 22 years since a female driver took to the wheel during a race weekend , while you have to go back to 1976 when @entity41 driver @entity40 last competed in a race			1
@entity0 came through the junior ranks of karting before stints in @entity46 and @entity49 @entity48 series @entity21 before being snapped up by @entity4 in 2012			0
but her failure to win a race during her professional career , coupled with her romantic association with @entity4 shareholder @entity54 have led some to argue she is fortunate to land a seat with the @entity11 team			1
' when she was karting , she was the only girl			0
she stuck with it and beat a lot of boys to get her seat and she really truly deserves the seat she has got within our race team , so i am really proud of that , ' @entity4 explains			0
behind the wheel : @entity0 takes part in the @entity3 test days at @entity71 's racetrack in @entity72 spot of tennis : @entity0 ( middle ) attends day seven of @entity76 at the @entity77 ' i really hope it encourages more girls to take up karting and to come up through the junior ranks because @entity0 has shown that you can do it , and she has also demonstrated that @entity3 is a non-gender bias sport			1
we are a sport that welcomes men and women to take part in a race on a sunday afternoon and not a lot of sports can actually say that			2
' @entity0 will also get behind the wheel during practice for the @entity49 @entity10 later this month , but @entity4 admitted there were no plans in place for the @entity100 to usurp regular drivers @entity18 and @entity13			1
' at the moment , we have two race drivers who are contracted to the team ; you never say never , but that is not part of the plan today , ' she said			0
' when you are a team principal , the only thing you care about when you are looking at a potential driver to put in your car is talent and that comes with speed , technical feedback , the whole package			0
whether you are a boy or a girl it does n't make a difference			0
no - one cares about that			0
' male dominated : only five women have taken part in a race weekend in @entity3 history in the spotlight : @entity0 arrives in the paddock before practice for the @entity130 @entity10			1

@entity0 will become the first woman to drive at a grand prix for 22 years
only five women have taken part in a race weekend in @entity3 history
the @entity100 will drive in practice for an hour and a half on friday
*critics* point to the fact she is the wife of @entity54 , the @entity144 boss
