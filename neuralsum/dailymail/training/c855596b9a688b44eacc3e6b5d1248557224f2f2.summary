@entity0 is putting the finishing touches to its watch ahead of an expected launch in march - and has released a test version of the software that will link it to an @entity7			1
the latest release of @entity9 , expected to be launched within weeks , includes references to the much anticipated watch			1
@entity12 will link via bluetooth and a special app on user 's @entity7			1
the @entity12 will use three types of app. notifications allow users to take action or respond right from their wrist such as turning the lights off after they 've left the house , quickly accessing flight details at the airport , and rerouting their transit when a train or bus is late			0
glances , which quickly show users information they care about most , such as the latest news and sports scores , alarm system status or the next step of a favorite recipe			0
full apps can use a developer 's own interface			2
' @entity44 menu is a new panel specifically for pairing an @entity7 with the @entity12 , ' said @entity46 of 9to5mac			2
' additionally , the instructions inside of the bluetooth menu specifically indicate that @entity0 will release a dedicated ' @entity50 app ' for setting up and controlling the wearable device			1
@entity0 has previously said the timepiece will be controlled by a special app. @entity55 users will install an @entity57 app on their @entity7 , which will be used to download apps onto the watch as well as manage @entity61 settings			1
a user ’s @entity7 is also used to help with computational demands , a nd help preserve the watch 's battery life			1
sources familiar with the product 's development say that the device is currently on track to ship in the @entity72 by the end of march , so far @entity0 has refused to reveal exactly when it will be released , although a statement made to @entity0 employees suggests the release will be in ' the spring			2
' it has previously been claimed that suppliers were struggling to make enough screens and processors			0
however , breakthroughs have been made in the number of successful yields for the watch 's display and processor , according to @entity88 's @entity87 late last year			1
now @entity89 's @entity46 says @entity91 employees are set to be trained in february			1
' one or two representatives from many @entity91 in the @entity72 , depending on store and market size , will be sent to @entity0 offices in either @entity96 , @entity97 or @entity98 , @entity99 to learn first - hand about the watch , ' he claims			1
the @entity12 will be available in three versions : watch , @entity104 , and @entity105 , a high end version made of specially developed precious metals			1
' these training programs will take place between february 9th and february 16th			1
' the employees will then train the rest of their store 's staff , it is believed			1
unveiled on september 9 at @entity0 's @entity7 launch event , the @entity12 is the company 's foray into wearable computers			2
@entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 have already launched their own smartwatches , but @entity0 is expected to face unprecedented demand for its watch			1
@entity126 , which is building the watch , has upped its number of workers from 2,000 to 10,000 and is ultimately aiming for 20,000			2
the initial round of shipments will be 3 to 5 million watches			0
@entity0 anticipates a total of 24 million watches will be shipped during 2015 , according to claims - and mass production will start in january @entity0 anticipates a total of 24 million watches to be shipped during 2015 , @entity138 said			0
according to @entity89 , @entity140 , @entity0 's senior vice president of retail and online stores hinted at the release date when she told staff : ' we 're going into the holidays , we 'll go into @entity146 , and then we 've got a new watch launch coming in the spring			1
' @entity0 's chief executive @entity148 unveiled the watch at a launch event in september			1
he did n't announce exactly when the watch would be available , but said it would go on sale ' early next year			2
' built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications the watch has a completely new user interface , different from the @entity7 , and the ' crown ' on the @entity12 is a dial called the ' digital crown			1
' users can turn the crown to zoom in and out on a map , or scroll a list			0
the crown can also be pressed to take the user back to the home screen			2
different areas on the watch face can be customised with taps and swipes , and force touches			2
the @entity176 feature shows info users would like to see , similar to @entity178 , and is accessed by swiping the screen up from the bottom			0
music can also be controlled on an @entity7 through the @entity12			0
built - in is a ' taptic engine ' that responds to a subtle vibrations users feel on their wrist for notifications			0
it understands questions in messages and then offers pre-selected answers , and messages can be dictated to the @entity7			0
users can also talk to the watch and send a voice reply , or have it transcribed to them			2
there is no keyboard on the watch , and messages can only be sent through dictation , or emoji			2
@entity202 also is built into the @entity12			0
a ' source close to @entity0 ' told the information last month that the firm ' would be lucky to ship [ the watch ] before @entity207 '			2
@entity146 falls on 19 february next year , so ms @entity209 comments push it at least beyond this date			2
despite the range of impressive features unveiled by mr @entity148 , there was something he failed to mention : battery life			0
the telling omission suggests the watch 's battery life will be the @entity220 of the device when it eventually does go on sale			1
@entity0 is said to be unhappy with the watch 's battery life , and the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year			1
@entity0 's chief executive @entity148 ( pictured ) unveiled the watch at a launch event in september			1
although he did n't reveal battery life details , mr @entity148 did spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity0 's magsafe technology with inductive charging most existing smartwatches on the market , such as @entity237 and @entity238 , tend to last up to a week on a single charge			1
the closest @entity148 came to talking about the battery life for the watch was saying that users would ' charge it at night			0
' during an interview in @entity246 , @entity0 's senior vice president of operations @entity244 said : ' we want to make the best product in the world			0
' one of our competitors is on their fourth or fifth attempt , but nobody is wearing them			0
' the company 's chief executive added that the @entity0 watch ' can be worn all day , for any occasion , ' but hourly figures were notably absent			1
a source said @entity0 is unhappy with the watch 's battery life , according to @entity262			1
another source confirmed to the technology site that that the battery life ' is about a day now			0
' the watch has a completely new user interface ( left ) , different from the @entity7 , and the ' crown ' on the @entity12 is a dial called the ' digital crown ' ( right ) presented by chief executive @entity148 the company 's chief executive added the @entity0 watch ' can be worn all day , for any occasion , ' but hourly figures were notably absent			1
the long lead time before the $ 349 ( £ 216 ) product ships could mean the device will be more functional once it 's released early next year a spokesperson for @entity0 declined to provide battery details to @entity278 and said they will be revealed closer to launch next year			0
like many of @entity0 's other products , the @entity12 appears to have a sealed back , which means the battery can not be replaced			0
this suggests that the entire $ 349 ( £ 216 ) device will have to be replaced , once the battery eventually deteriorates from constant charging and use			0
another concern is the launch of the health and activity - tracking apps on the @entity12 , which will rely on adequate battery life for round - the - clock monitoring			0
companies including @entity295 and @entity296 have health trackers that are designed to be worn at night too , monitoring sleep patterns through movements			0
however , if the watch has to be charged at night , vital health signs could be missed by the gadget which @entity0 says will ' motivate people to be more active and more healthy			0
' @entity0 did , however , spend some time talking about the watch 's charging system , which combines @entity0 's magsafe technology with inductive charging			1
@entity0 's silence on battery life suggests the company is still working to improve the feature			0
the success of the device could hang on whether or not it manages to do it in time .			0

watch will link via bluetooth and a special app on user 's iphone
@entity91 staff expected to undergo training in february
