@entity1 trolls are using @entity2 to send images of a @entity4 to strangers around the world a photograph of a sloth in a spacesuit is being sent to unsuspecting @entity1 users by pranksters who are exploiting a security loophole in @entity14 's @entity2 service			1
owners of @entity14 's @entity1 who have upgraded to its latest @entity16 8 software have reported receiving the photograph , known as ' astronaut slot or ' @entity20 '			1
a photographer and writer based in @entity23 is thought to have been the first to have used this to send unsolicited pictures of the @entity27 sloth to commuters while travelling to work by train			1
@entity31 said he began trolling strangers on the train with the image , which was created by artist @entity35 , to highlight the dangers of allowing an @entity1 to receive files from anyone in the surrounding area			1
the practice takes advantage of a security feature in @entity14 's @entity2 service , which allows users to share files wirelessly over @entity45 and bluetooth networks			1
after upgrading the operating software , iphones and @entity49 can be set to receive files from ' everyone ' in the surrounding area			2
it is thought to work within a range of around 30 feet			2
but now it appears his prank has been adopted by others and is spreading around the world , with victims reporting being sent the image by @entity2 in @entity61 and @entity62			1
mr @entity31 , who began trolling commuters in @entity23 a year ago , insists he is not responsible for the appearance of the @entity65 on iphones in other cities as he has been ' landlocked ' in @entity68			2
when contacted about the image appearing on phones in @entity61 , from @entity1 users called @entity72 ' , he described the spread as both ' wonderful and terrible '			1
the @entity20 began appearing on the internet in february 2012 after an artist called @entity35 posted the image on the website @entity77 and @entity79			0
within just a few months the image had been shared millions of times and had its own spoof twitter account and @entity84 fan pages			0
it gained notoriety as people began using the image to play pranks on friends and colleagues by using it to replace pictures in frames on their desks or setting it as their desktop picture			2
the picture was created by superimposing a sloth 's head over the face of an astronaut			0
while many nicknamed the sloth @entity106 , the spacesuit actually belongs to one of the crew who took part in the mission to the @entity111 in 2003			0
it is believed the photograph originally used to create the image was a portrait of @entity117 astronaut @entity116			0
he said : ' i certainly did n't invent the concept of sending strangers unsolicited files using @entity2 , but i 'd like to think that i 'm doing it in a way that 's more fun than malicious			2
' you could send much worse things , which i 'm not so sure was well known by most people			0
' when i first started exploring this , artist @entity129 's sloth in a spacesuit seemed like a perfect fit : it was playful and disarming			2
' you could easily argue that this is not a nice thing to do to people , but i 'd like to think that by leaving the feature set to " everyone , " you 're secretly hoping to see a sloth			0
' while the picture of the sloth in the space suit is harmless - it originally started being shared over the internet in 2012 after artist @entity129 uploaded it to his @entity77 account - it highlights an important security loophole in the @entity1			1
by allowing @entity1 users to send unsolicited files to anyone with this setting turned on , it could allow hackers to install virus software that could allow them to eavesdrop or even take over devices			1
in september @entity14 also extended its @entity2 service to include macbooks and @entity158 , meaning the number of devices that could be vulnerable are even greater			2
for many the @entity160 may be simply an amusing way of trolling strangers to see their reaction upon receiving the photo			0
it is a new twist on a prank that began in 2012 when people began replacing desktop images and screen savers of friends and colleagues with the picture			0
technology writer @entity174 is among those to have been targeted by the @entity72 prank , sent from an @entity2 user who apparently shares his name with notorious @entity117 murder and gangster @entity180 the @entity20 has developed its own dedicated online followers with fan pages and its own twitter feed the image quickly became a meme of its own as people replaced the heads of humans from other historic images and pictures			1
the image even began appearing on t - shirts , coffee mugs and bags			0
among those to have received the sloth picture over @entity2 is @entity174 , former editor in chief of @entity200 magazine and technology editor of @entity203 based magazine @entity202			1
other victims have reported being sent the space sloth in @entity206 , @entity61 , an @entity2 user identifying themselves only as @entity208 's ' @entity1 '			1
for mr @entity31 , the thrill of watching the reactions of his fellow commuters while keeping a straight face , saw him troll stranger after stranger			0
writing on the website @entity218 , he said : ' i 've done it perhaps a hundred times , and the thrill has not waned one little bit			0
' i 've seen reactions that range from amused to confused , but never has anyone been visibly angered			0
' the beauty of the technology is that your targets can be far away by the time you 've done the deed			0
' @entity14 's @entity2 allows @entity1 users to send pictures and files to other @entity14 devices over @entity45 and bluetooth networks but those who leave the service set to receive from ' everyone ' ( right ) are vulnerable to hackers			1

@entity1 owners report receiving sloth pictures from mystery @entity2 users
space sloth pictures *demonstrate* how @entity2 could also be used to send virus software that would allow hackers to eavesdrop on @entity1 users
prank is thought to have been started by a photographer in @entity23
victims have reported being sent the image in @entity62 and @entity61
