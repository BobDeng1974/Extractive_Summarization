a @entity1 artist known for his anti-communist stance has floated a huge statue of a hand making an obscene gesture on @entity7 's main river			1
@entity9 's none - too - subtle artwork was paraded days before parliamentary elections that could give the @entity11 a taste of power almost a quarter - century after they were ousted			1
the artist 's giant purple hand , extending an oversized middle finger , was placed on a pontoon on the @entity18 , near the famed @entity19 and facing @entity20 , the seat of the presidency			2
not subtle : @entity1 artist @entity9 has made his feelings on the looming prospect of the @entity11 gaining political influence with a giant purple hand making an obscene gesture president @entity28 supports a plan by the leftist @entity30 to form a minority government after the vote with tacit support from the maverick @entity34			1
it would be for the first time since the @entity37 that the party would get power , at least indirectly			2
in the eyes of many people in the country of 10 million people , the @entity11 are linked to 41 years of repression			1
the artwork was installed this morning , four days before the @entity1 early general election but after decades on the sidelines , the party has escaped the taint of sleaze that has tarnished subsequent governments			0
it is unclear how long the finger will stay there			0
@entity9 has been tight - lipped about the piece but told reporters the gesture spoke for itself			1
what mattered , he said , was which way it was pointing , reports the @entity61			0
president @entity28 is currently on an official visit to @entity64 and said he could not comment as he had seen it			0
the @entity1 parliament is undergoing a major upheaval and was dissolved in august			0
prime minister @entity69 's government collapsed in june as a bribery scandal raged , and a government of technocrats , formed by president @entity28 in july but heavily resisted by the main political parties resigned in august			1
an opinion poll conducted in august by @entity1 pollster @entity75 gave the @entity30 a 27 per cent share of the vote , followed by the @entity11 on 16.7 per cent			1
the @entity79 that ended @entity34 rule over @entity81 was led by dissident playwright @entity82			0
he was repeatedly jailed by the @entity84 - allied @entity34 authorities in the 1970s and 80s for his activism in the @entity88 civil rights movement and then led the nation as president from 1989 to 2003			0
the @entity79 ( pictured ) in 1989 ended 41 years of @entity34 oppression , but now they are set to once again have a say in the future of the @entity1 @entity1 president @entity28 has backed a power - sharing plan with the @entity11			1
the party 's popularity has grown as they have escaped any political scandals it started as as student protest on november 17 , 1989 , after fiery speeches at a university campus in @entity7 inspired thousands of students to march downtown toward @entity106			2
as darkness fell , police cracked down hard , but the crowds continued to grow , famously chanting : ' you have lost already ! ' they were right			0
following the collapse of the @entity112 and communism in the region , @entity81 had a new government by december			0
@entity9 is known for his controversial art , including statues of two men urinating at the @entity119 in @entity7			2
