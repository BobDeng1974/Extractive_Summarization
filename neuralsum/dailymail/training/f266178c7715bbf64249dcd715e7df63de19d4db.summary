the @entity0 is the seaside town 's pride and joy			2
but it takes a lot of elbow grease to keep it sparkling			0
last year , the well - known landmark hosted the iconic @entity0 ’s 120th @entity9 celebrations and events such as the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 – not to mention the ultimate ballroom dancing competition , @entity15			1
so it 's hardly surprising that it 's in need of a painstaking cleaning and maintenance programme - an annual event which takes two weeks to complete			0
this huge task begins with a thorough refurbishment of the dance floor , which since the ballroom opened 118 years ago , has been graced by millions of fox - trotting feet and sees 650,000 visitors each year			2
a team of maintenance engineers strip back , sand and polish the 120ft parquet floor , consisting of 30,602 blocks of mahogany , oak and walnut			1
the ballroom ’s 14 ornate @entity36 chandeliers are then lowered , and every shard of crystal is buffed			1
each of the 1,120 lights must be individually inspected , to ensure their perfect working condition for the coming season			0
general manager , @entity44 , explains : ' of course it 's a colossal undertaking , requiring huge skill , but it 's maintenance work such as this that keeps the opulence and grandeur of the @entity0 alive			2
' because of the extra funds generated from the balconies fee of £ 2.95 per person we are now in a position to start phase 1 work on the upholstery in the @entity0			0
' we 're incredibly proud of our team , whose dedication and hard work make it possible to preserve this great @entity63 building			0
we ca n't wait to kick off the 2015 season at the @entity0 , now that it 's been given a little tender love and care !
