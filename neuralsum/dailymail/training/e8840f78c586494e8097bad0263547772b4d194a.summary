by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 06:04 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 08:57 est , 25 october 2012 @entity3 ’s former ‘ back - to - work tsar ’ @entity2 last night claimed she was ‘ bullied ’ out of her job following embarrassing revelations that she had paid herself £ 8.6 million			1
in an emotional interview mrs @entity2 said she had been unfairly caught up in a ‘ political maelstrom ’ , forcing her to quit her roles as a @entity12 adviser and as chairman of controversial welfare - to - work firm @entity14			1
she did not criticise mr @entity3 directly			0
but , appearing close to tears , she said : ‘ i am a useful face for the political people to have a go at			1
figures passed to @entity32 revealed that just 3,400 of the 94,000 jobseekers referred to @entity14 were found a job lasting six months or more during the first year of the government ’s flagship @entity27			1
despite this , the firm was paid £ 45.9 million for its work on the scheme , which ministers hope will get the long - term jobless back to work and drive down unemployment			1
on average , each job cost the taxpayer £ 13,500			0
the figures - which were disputed by the company - will spark fresh concerns about whether the £ 5 billion @entity27 can deliver value for money to the taxpayer and cut unemployment			1
ministers have argued that the terms of the ‘ payment - by - results ’ scheme mean that firms will not profit unless they find jobs for significant numbers of unemployed people			1
but firms like @entity14 , one of five main contractors , receive a ‘ referral fee ’ of at least £ 400 for each jobseeker they take on			1
jobseekers considered harder to place attract a fee of £ 600			0
@entity14 then receives £ 1,200 if a client is placed in a job for six months , with further payments to follow for up to 20 months			1
the leaked figures suggest @entity14 ’s success rate during the first year of the programme was just 3.65 per cent - well below even the government ’s minimum threshold of 5.5 per cent			1
mrs @entity2 last night said the figures were ‘ all wrong ’ , but declined to say what the true position is			2
she said the statistics were part of an ongoing attempt to discredit the operation of the @entity27			0
she added : ' i was bullied out of a job that i had been doing for 25 years			0
' my staff have been bullied			0
and do you know what ’s worse ? because of the reporting you did my children have been bullied			0
' ms @entity2 disputed figures showing @entity14 had a success rate of getting people into work of just 3.65 per cent she added : ' it ’s time this bullying stopped			1
bullying entrepreneurs like me , someone like me who has invested tens of millions and employed thousands of people , it ’s not good for the @entity98			2
' ' we were caught in this political maelstrom			0
i am a useful face for the politics people to have a go at			2
' i am not a politician , i am not a civil servant , i am not experienced in this stuff			0
but i was really useful to have a go at			0
and they used me and my organisation and i stepped down as the chairman , which is still incredibly upsetting as it ’s something i loved doing			2
' when i meet people in the street and they say " oh , i recognise you , your lot got me that job			2
i ’m now working at @entity120 , it ’s transformed my life " , i bloody love the work i do			2
' @entity14 also disputed the figures , which it said it ‘ did not recognise ’			1
mrs @entity2 said @entity14 was a ‘ wonderful company ’ , and insisted she had invested £ 50 million in building it up			1
and she struggled to control her emotions as she discussed her spectacular downfall earlier this year			0
mrs @entity2 quit as the prime minister ’s adviser two weeks after the @entity130 revealed she had paid herself an astonishing dividend of £ 8.6 million , most of it relating to public sector contracts			2
the following day she quit as the company ’s chairman , although she still controls 85 per cent of the firm ’s shares			1
the firm also faced a string of allegations of fraud , although it was later largely cleared of serious abuse by the @entity144			0
mrs @entity2 said she had been ‘ bullied out of a job i loved ’ and remained ‘ incredibly upset ’ about what had happened			0
she said the firm ’s staff , and even her own children , had also been bullied			0
she went on : ‘ bullying entrepreneurs is not good for the @entity98			0
’ in a statement last night @entity14 said the leaked figures were ‘ out of date ’ , adding that the ‘ data does not give a full or accurate picture of @entity27 performance ’			1
the company pointed out that the @entity27 is only 18 months into a five - year scheme			2
the @entity144 is expected to publish its own initial figures next month , but has cautioned it is too early to judge the final outcome of the scheme .			0

the former chairman of @entity14 was forced to quit in a *row* about the company *'s* work in helping people into jobs
