on thursday afternoon radical new measures were announced for @entity1 , set to force women wearing the burqa to sit in an enclosed room behind glass screens			1
however on thursday evening it was revealed by @entity7 that prime minister @entity8 had backed down on the plans proposed by speaker @entity10 and @entity12 president @entity11 earlier in the day			1
mr @entity8 is said to have been forced to ask ms @entity10 and mr @entity11 to reconsider the plan due to extreme public backlash			1
despite this , the prime minister is likely to maintain that different measures apply for more secure areas of the building			1
' the decision by the government to isolate , in their own rooms , burqa - wearers observing the parliament has no security merit at all , ' mr @entity33 said			1
mrs @entity10 's office told @entity43 on thursday night they were yet to have any contact from the prime minister on the matter			1
opposition leader @entity47 said mr @entity8 let the divisive debate on banning burqas and niqabs drag on too long			2
' if we 're asking our troops to stand up to sectarianism , intolerance and prejudice overseas , we should be prepared to do the same in our parliament , ' he told @entity43			0
@entity29 also wrote asking mrs @entity10 to reconsider the move , saying every @entity59 should feel welcome visiting @entity1			2
@entity12 president @entity11 says security officers need to be able to quickly identify people shouting out from the public galleries			1
some senators have condemned the planned move saying it has no security merit , while others said mr @entity8 does not have the power to veto the decision he insists it 's an interim measure until @entity71 and @entity72 advise him and mrs @entity10 on screening policies in relation to garments that hide identity			1
liberal senator @entity77 said on thursday night people should n't get their hopes up over the prime ministerial intervention because mr @entity8 did n't have a veto over the presiding officers ' decisions			1
the @entity85 report that two ministers told them that the move to discriminate against @entity59 with face coverings was a mistake , and one apparently described the plan as ' incredibly foolish '			0
reports from @entity7 earlier on thursday revealed the changes that were set to be introduced for the presiding officers regarding access arrangements			2
article c of the changes stated : ' persons with facial coverings entering the galleries of the @entity101 and @entity12 will be seated in the enclosed galleries			0
this will ensure that persons with facial coverings can continue to enter the @entity107 galleries , without needing to be identifiable '			0
it meant women who wear face coverings will still be allowed to enter parliament and view the proceedings and overcome potential problems for security staff who are required to identify all visitors seated in the lower public gallery			2
the enclosed space ( on a floor above ) is usually reserved for children on school excursions , to limit noise disruptions			0
the move comes as outspoken senator @entity124 clashed on live tv with a @entity24 woman as she continued to call for burqas to be banned			1
spat : senator @entity124 appeared on the program with @entity132 spokeswoman @entity131 in a spirited debate on the @entity138 's @entity137 program , @entity134 senator ms @entity124 said the debate was a ' national security issue ' because people needed to be identifiable			1
but @entity132 executive officer @entity131 , who wears a hijab , laughed off her comments , insisting someone wearing a burqa is not a threat			2
. ' how is that going to be a threat ? that 's a question for you , ' ms @entity131 said			0
ms @entity124 said she needed to be able to see people 's faces and ' body language ' at all times			0
' we need to be able to identify people walking on the streets , that 's what 's going on , ' she said			1
but ms @entity131 insisted @entity24 women were allowed to lift their veil to show their faces to authorities			1
debate : @entity131 , the executive officer of the @entity132 ' it is a given that for identification purposes , @entity24 women , within reason , can just lift up and show their @entity168 , ' she said			1
under further questioning , ms @entity124 said she would not ask people to remove hats , overcoats or other clothing as she could see their faces			2
ms @entity131 replied that she could easily ask to see the face of a woman wearing a burqa if she asked			0
' you can see it ! no one 's stopping you from not seeing it			0
' ms @entity124 fired back : ' i can not see who is under that clothing			0
i ca n't see if there 's a man or woman under that clothing			0
' ' no one 's stopping you from seeing it though ! ' ms @entity131 said			0
fiery confrontation : ms @entity124 came under questioning from ms @entity131 ms @entity124 also admitted she had never asked a @entity24 woman to show their face to her			2
' is there any reason - why do you - do you feel offended that i 'm asking you to show your face ? ' she asked ms @entity131			0
' we live in this wonderful country			0
and i 'm very aware , that , you know , you have beautiful faces , and ... it would be nice to be able to see them			0
' but it still comes back to a national security issue '			0
the senator also praised prime minister @entity8 for his ' courage ' and ' strength ' in publicly branding the burqa ' confronting ' yesterday			1
' i 've said before that i find it a fairly confronting form of attire , and frankly i wish it was not worn , ' mr @entity8 told reporters			0
the prime minister @entity8 ( pictured centre ) yesterday repeated remarks he had made in the past about the burqa ' but we are a free country and a free society and it 's not the business of government to tell people what they should and should not wear			1
' mr @entity8 also said that , as far as he was aware , no woman has ever worn a burqa into @entity1			1
liberal senator @entity236 has written to @entity1 's presiding officers requesting the burqa be banned from the premises			2
last month , ms @entity124 re-posted a meme of a woman wearing a burqa holding a gun which was captioned : ' for security reasons it is time to ban the burqa '			2
outspoken @entity34 mp @entity33 said ' the decision by the government to isolate , in their own rooms , burqa - wearers observing the @entity1 has no security merit at all			1
the segregation of one group of people like this is nothing more than religious apartheid and deeply wrong ' .			0

on thursday afternoon new security measures in parliament were set to force burqa - wearing women behind glass screens
on thursday evening it was revealed that prime minister @entity8 backed down on the plan
the changes were proposed by speaker @entity10 and @entity12 president @entity11 earlier in the day
senator @entity124 has demanded @entity24 women remove their burqas ' now '
' we need to be able to identify people on the streets , ' senator @entity124 said
independent mp @entity33 *blasted* the changes ' to isolate , in their own rooms , burqa - wearers observing @entity1 has no security merit at all '
her comments come a day after prime minister @entity8 described burqas as ' confronting '
