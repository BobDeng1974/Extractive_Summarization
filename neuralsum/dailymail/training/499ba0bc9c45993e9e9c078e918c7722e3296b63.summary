@entity0 and rising @entity2 star @entity1 refused on wednesday to say whether he believes in evolution during a q and a at a @entity5 think tank			1
after declining to answer numerous questions related to foreign policy , out of respect for the sitting @entity11 , the likely presidential candidate evaded the event moderator 's question about evolution , telling him , ' for me , i am going to punt on that one as well			1
' ' that 's a question a politician should n't be involved in one way or the other , ' he added			2
' i 'm here to talk about trade , not to pontificate on other issues , ' he said , heartily adding , to laughter , ' i love the issue of trade in @entity21			0
' recently elected to his second term as governor in @entity21 after surviving a recall challenge in his first term , @entity1 is now on the path to the @entity2 nomination for president			0
he has been making the rounds in early presidential states such as @entity51 , where he reportedly leased office space this week , and is currently on a trip to the @entity31 after fellow presumed @entity2 presidential contender @entity56 's disastrous trip to @entity57 last week that involved the cancellation of several press conferences after the @entity61 politician came under attack in the @entity63 for his lavish spending and his position on mandatory vaccinations , @entity1 's team said the @entity21 governor would take no questions from reporters while abroad			1
the only exception was to be today 's speech at @entity26 , an international affairs institute , followed by a sit down interview with @entity27			0
but even then , @entity1 was not inclined to give direct answers to many of the questions put before him , according to reporters present			0
the @entity77 said @entity1 excused himself from commenting on world affairs because he holds the ' old - fashioned ' view that it 's not appropriate to ' talk about foreign policy while you 're on foreign soil			1
' ' i do n't think it 's wise to undermine your own president ' on trips such as these , he later said			2
officially in @entity31 as part of a taxpayer - funded trade mission , the @entity31 visit is widely seen as an opportunity for @entity1 to bulk up his foreign policy credentials before he formally announces a presidential bid			1
on tuesday the @entity2 governor met with @entity31 prime minister @entity96			0
today he paid a visit to the speaker of the @entity99 , @entity98			0
during the trip he also visited a @entity102 dealership - the company was founded in @entity21 , and stopped by the grave of @entity31 prime minister @entity105 , a conservative icon , to pay his respects			0
@entity1 is pictured leaving 10 @entity107 after a private meeting with @entity31 prime minister @entity96 in @entity5 on tuesday			2
@entity1 is leading a coalition of @entity21 government and business officials on a trade mission that runs until friday			2
the trip gives him a chance to bolster his overseas and foreign policy credentials as he considers running for president in 2016 @entity1 is not alone among the probable @entity2 presidential candidates in his hesitancy to take a stance on evolution			1
former governors @entity122 of @entity123 and @entity124 of @entity125 have both waffled when asked about the scientific origins of creation			0
@entity56 has also been wo n't to discuss the subject or anything related to foreign policy			2
still , the @entity131 took a shot at @entity1 on wednesday afternoon over the ducking and dodging			0
' for someone who went to @entity5 to build his street cred as a serious leader all @entity1 showed today was the same ducking and dodging @entity140 know all too well and that we ’ve come to expect from the 2016 @entity2 field , whose policy positions are just too divisive to share , ' the @entity131 's national press secretary , @entity139 , said in an email to reporters			1
' would ’ve been a lot simpler to just stay home , ' she added			0
in a separate email later in the day , @entity131 communications director @entity148 trolled the @entity2 field and asked , ' do any other @entity2 presidential candidates want to go to @entity5 ? ' if so , let us know			1
the @entity131 is more than happy to pick up your travel costs , ' @entity148 said .			1

' that 's a question a politician should n't be involved in one way or the other , ' @entity1 said during an appearance at @entity26
he also declined to answer numerous questions related to foreign policy ; ' i do n't think it 's wise to undermine your own president ' on foreign soil
officially on a taxpayer - funded trade mission , the @entity31 visit is seen as an opportunity for @entity1 to bulk up his foreign policy credentials
the @entity131 trolled him after : ' do any other @entity2 presidential candidates want to go to @entity5 ? the @entity131 is more than happy to pick up your travel costs '
