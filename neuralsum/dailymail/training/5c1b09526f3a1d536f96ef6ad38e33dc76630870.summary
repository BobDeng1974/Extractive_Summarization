@entity0 watched this shambles play out from a comfy seat in the directors ’ box at @entity5			1
the temptation at half - time , when his beloved @entity8 trooped off 2 - 0 down to a chorus of boos , was to ask him to take charge after the break			1
why wait ? these days @entity0 , who turned down the @entity8 job last year in the build - up to the @entity14 , is the @entity15 ’s head coach			1
that side , playing catch - up on @entity8 ’s 132 - year history , get the game better than the group of players allotted to @entity22			1
there will be another inquest at the training ground on monday after @entity22 ’s team slumped to their fourth home defeat in five @entity29 matches			0
@entity8 legend and current @entity15 manager @entity0 watched sunday 's clash at @entity5 @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 ( centre ) show their despair as a chance goes begging near the final whistle @entity39 looks focused as he strikes the ball after six minutes to give visitors @entity41 the lead against @entity8 @entity41 were streets ahead : slick , organised , disciplined and focused — all the things @entity8 want to be			1
does n’t it hurt to be booed off at half - time ? is n’t it humiliating to be dragged off , as @entity48 and @entity49 were , after just 45 minutes ? ‘ tactical reasons , ’ claimed @entity22			1
@entity22 , who is struggling to make an impact at @entity8 , added : ‘ we need to find the solution and i need to change the mentality of the players			1
they know my feelings like i know their feelings			0
we feel the same , very disappointed and frustrated , and not happy because our performance was n’t good enough			0
‘ it ’s clear we need to improve a lot , and quickly			0
this is my challenge in the next few weeks			0
’ @entity41 were rampant in the first half , taking the lead through the wriggling figure of @entity39 and doubling their advantage when @entity69 scored with a simple tap - in			1
the @entity72 striker celebrates breaking his @entity41 duck but @entity22 preferred to focus on the second goal @entity8 manager @entity22 ( centre ) looks apprehensive during another disappointing display @entity77 celebrates after his volley with 12 minutes to go halved @entity41 's lead and gave @entity8 hope bar @entity82 ’s glorious volley at the back post 13 minutes from time , this was dreadful			1
there is no pattern to @entity8 ’s play			1
we were promised one of the best coaches in world football , one of the most innovative in the @entity29 , when @entity22 was head - hunted from @entity94			0
he does n’t have the answers			0
to watch @entity96 delay his arrival as a substitute when his team were 2 - 0 down by changing his boots makes you feel sick			0
that is what the half - hour warm - up is for and the weather conditions had n’t changed			0
instead , the storm clouds are gathering at @entity8 again			1
when they were chasing the game seven minutes from time , right back @entity107 was dismissed for a foolish nudge on @entity111			0
so , to @entity41 , and this glitzy performance			1
@entity39 ’s first goal in @entity115 football was excellent , coasting past @entity8 ’s defence to lash the ball beyond @entity118			2
can @entity39 , once tipped to be better than @entity119 at @entity120 , do it on a wet , windy night in @entity41 ? that ’s not so clear cut , but what we do know is that the little @entity72 forward found @entity5 to his liking			1
the beauty of playing @entity8 is that they always give you a chance sooner or later			2
referee @entity131 ( second right ) waves the red card and @entity107 ( left ) is off down the tunnel @entity41 manager @entity135 admitted he had to be patient with @entity39 , saying : ‘ we are really pleased that he is finally coming to the fore			2
he started off like a house on fire when he joined us in pre-season , and people got a little bit carried away because we all felt it was going to take him time to adjust			0
‘ he has had the benefit of three or four months ’ training at the intensity he needs and he looks a very accomplished player again			0
’ even when @entity41 were forced into a defensive reshuffle , they were untroubled throughout a first half dominated by @entity135 ’s side			1
@entity155 succumbed to injury after nine minutes and was replaced by @entity157			0
@entity158 was substituted for @entity159 after 26			0
moments later , @entity41 scored again			2
this @entity8 defence needs sorting out because the goal @entity69 scored was too easy			2
@entity162 bounced through unchallenged into the danger zone and placed the ball into the path of @entity69 for the @entity41 forward to finish the job			2
@entity69 makes it 2 - 0 , but @entity22 complained ' it is not possible to make these mistakes ' @entity135 celebrates his side 's win at @entity5 after keeping faith in @entity39 , and being rewarded there are rumblings of discontent around these parts and it is becoming increasingly difficult to defend @entity22			1
even @entity33 — ‘ he ’s one of our own , ’ the @entity8 fans sing — could n’t get going as @entity41 ’s giant centre half @entity178 handled him impeccably			1
the kid hardly got a kick			0
@entity82 gave @entity8 hope when he picked the ball out of the air to beat @entity186 with an angled volley , but the dismissal of @entity107 confirmed the worst			2
@entity33 ’s desperate late attempt to repeat his last - minute free - kick against @entity191 last week was drilled straight at the wall			0
that was enough for @entity0 and the rest of the @entity196 delegation , who made their excuses and left			2
whether the @entity199 can face returning is another matter .			0

@entity8 legend @entity0 saw his former club lose to @entity41
@entity48 and @entity49 were taken off after 45 minutes
@entity8 *supporters* at @entity5 booed their side at the *interval*
