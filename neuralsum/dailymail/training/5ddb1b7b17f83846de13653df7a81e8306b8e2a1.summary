it 's enough to make your hair stand on end			1
an @entity5 teenager has told how he can withstand 11,000 volts passing through his body - and only discovered his bizarre talent by accident when he was repairing his mother ’s heater			1
human electricity insulator @entity11 can apparently resist the same amount of voltage required to power 500 houses and even sit with his hands inside a tub of water along with naked live wires			1
the 16 - year - old claims : ‘ i have a gift from @entity25			1
i have the power to do things no - one else can and i do n’t intend on wasting it			1
‘ i used to be scared of electricity but now i am confident			2
i have tested myself over and over again and i will never get hurt			0
i can touch a live wire with my tongue and i know nothing will happen to me			2
he said : ' i used to be scared of electricity but now i am confident			0
i have tested myself over and over again and i will never get hurt ' what a shocker : the teenager can resist the same amount of voltage required to power 500 houses and even sit with his hands inside a tub of water along with naked live wires bright spark : @entity11 believes his ability is a gift and added : ‘ i have a gift from @entity25			1
i have the power to do things no - one else can and i do n’t intend on wasting it ' @entity11 , who is a student , first discovered that he can resist such high levels of electricity three years ago when he was fixing his mother ’s portable heater			1
he revealed : ‘ my mother kept complaining that our heater was broken so i thought i ’d take a look and try and fix it myself because we could n’t afford to take it anywhere and pay someone to fix it			1
‘ i accidentally touched the live wire with my screwdriver but nothing happened - i did n’t get a shock			0
but at the time i assumed we must have had a power failure in our village			2
’ two weeks later , @entity11 got a movie stuck inside his dvd player and decided to take the machine apart to attempt to retrieve the disc			1
‘ i hit the live wires again but again nothing happened , ’ he said			0
‘ this time i knew something amazing had just happened			0
i touched it again and again , and then went outside to check the power supply was ok			2
‘ that was the day i realised there was something unusual about me			0
’ wonder boy : locals frequently asked @entity11 to repair equipment or electric line faults in their village , where he has become something of a celebrity proud family : @entity11 ( standing , centre ) poses with brother @entity93 ( left ) , mum @entity94 ( right ) and younger brother @entity95 ( sitting ) electric shocks above 2,700 volts can be fatal to human beings - with shocks above 11,000 volts considered ' usually fatal '			1
more than 2.5million people in the @entity100 suffer a mains voltage electric shock per year , according to statistics from @entity104			2
the most recent statistics from the @entity106 show that 200 people suffered serious or major injury from contact with electricity or electrical discharge in the workplace in the last year in the @entity100			0
there were also two deaths			0
electric shocks can stop the heart from beating properly , prevent breathing and cause painful muscle spasms			0
the voltage causes current to flow that blocks the electrical signals between the brain and the muscles			2
in 1890 , murderer @entity124 was the first man to be executed in the @entity125 by electric chair			0
a voltage of approximately 1,000 volts was applied for two minutes in order to kill him			1
since that moment , @entity11 has been experimenting with various devices of different voltages - and he has been continually amazed by what he can withstand			1
he has tried light bulbs , tv wires , an electric woodcutter and an electrical water pump but each time , he would simply stop the devices working but not suffer any injuries			0
if anyone else were to attempt the same , it is highly likely they would be killed instantly			0
he added : ‘ i experimented with different levels of voltages and my body was still unaffected			0
' i could cope with 110 volts , 240 volts , 440 volts and my curiosity kept on growing			0
i wanted to know more and more			0
how much i could actually cope with ? ’ to find out , @entity11 decided to test his limits by climbing an electric pole in a nearby field to touch the 11,000 voltage high - tension wire that powers his village			1
soon , a crowd had gathered beneath him and started screaming in fear as they thought he was trying to commit suicide			0
@entity11 said : ‘ i was hanging from the pole touching the wires and i think people thought i was crazy			1
' my mother came running over and started begging me to come down			2
she thought i was killing myself			0
' but once people saw me touch the wires and walk away unscathed , everyone started cheering			0
’ human conductor : @entity11 can withstand an incredible 11,000 volts - which could kill another human being a voltage as low as 50 volts applied between two parts of the human body can cause a current to flow that blocks the electrical signals between the brain and the muscles , causing a shock			1
but the true measure of shock 's intensity lies in the amount of current - measured in amperes - that is forced though the body , and not the voltage			1
@entity11 - who is now known as @entity185 in his remote village near @entity187 , in @entity188 , northern @entity5 - is frequently asked by local families to repair equipment or electric line faults			1
but he refuses to charge for his services , as he does not believe in profiting from financially from his gift and added : ‘ i ’m out most days doing some kind of repair work now			2
‘ i work with my bare hands without any pliers or other equipment			0
but i do n’t charge anything , i do n’t make any money			0
’ and @entity11 , who dreams of becoming a manager in the government ’s electricity department , also revealed he has never hurt himself doing his stunts except burning the tips of his fingers if he holds a live wire long enough			1
@entity11 's worried schoolteacher urged him to see a doctor , but their tests returned nothing of note			1
he added : ‘ doctors did some blood test and did an overall check up but they found nothing wrong with me			0
‘ instead they started taking pictures of me on their camera , like i was some famous @entity220 actor or something			0
' wired up : @entity11 with his mother @entity94			1
she said : ' can you believe my boy does n’t get electric shocks ? i have two other sons but they are as normal as any other human			2
only @entity11 has this special power ' but experts have warned against copying @entity11 's behaviour , and @entity233 from @entity104 said : ' this is a life - threatening activity and one which we strongly advise against			1
' electricity has the potential to kill or seriously injure anyone unfortunate enough to come in to contact with it , so it is baffling that someone would voluntarily put themselves at such risk			2
' in the @entity100 alone , we estimate that 350,000 people are seriously injured by electricity each year and at @entity104 we are regrettably only too familiar with the devastating impact that electrical accidents can have			0
' this is a disaster waiting to happen and we would urge anyone attempting it to think twice about the potentially horrific consequences of such an action ”			1
while @entity11 - who had an insulated upbringing - relishes his incredible talent , his widowed mother , @entity255 , 35 , who has two other sons @entity93 , 18 , and 12 - year - old @entity95 , finds it difficult to understand his amazing abilities			1
@entity94 , who earns 2,500 rupees ( £ 25 ) a month as a dinner lady at the local school , said : ‘ can you believe my boy does n’t get electric shocks ? i have two other sons but they are as normal as any other human			2
only @entity11 has this special power			1
' i feel it is the blessing of his late father			2
his father passed away in october 2011 and in april 2012 he found he had this talent			2
’ high voltage : ambitious student @entity11 now dreams of becoming a manager in the government ’s electricity department @entity273 , 25 , an electrical engineer from @entity274 , said : ‘ the power of 11,000 volts is fatal			1
' even if a man is standing five meters away he can get pulled by the high - tension wire and burn to death			0
if a person touches 11,000 volts , he would n’t get a shock - he would die instantly			0
‘ a high voltage power line is used to supply electricity to villages and towns			1
if it can supply electricity to 1,000 kilometres , you can imagine how powerful it is			0

@entity11 discovered his ' talent ' when fixing mother 's heater
the teenager can resist voltage needed to power 500 houses
same amount of power could kill any other human being
he says : ' i have a gift from @entity25 . i feel very privileged '
but experts warn @entity11 : ' this is a disaster waiting to happen '
