superfan : @entity6 , right , had two quotes from @entity1 's novels @entity10 and @entity9 tattooed on his leg			1
one reads : ' better to live life as enjoyable and complete an experience as possible , in case death is s * * * e ' spitting image : another of mr @entity6 's tattoos mimics the pose of @entity14 , who played heroin addict @entity15 in the film version of @entity9 , in official posters			2
the film propelled @entity1 to cult status the soldier , who is from @entity44 and based in @entity45 , said : ' i first saw trainspotting a few years ago and i absolutely loved it , how it was shot , the story and just how different it was alongside other films , including the story			2
' then more recently i read the book and really enjoyed it			0
' as soon as i saw @entity10 was being released and it was written by @entity1 i wanted to see it			0
' i went on to read that book , then @entity55 and now i ’m starting his other book called @entity57			0
' i ’m a massive fan due to the style of how he writes his books and the darkness of some of the stories is brilliant			0
' @entity10 was amazing as it appealed to me due to the fact that i do military police work , albeit that shows slightly different methods of policing			2
' made into a film last year starring @entity70 and @entity71 , @entity10 tells the story of a corrupt , sexist , homophobic , cocaine - snorting policeman who struggles to balance his drug habit with tackling @entity25 's violent gangs			2
inked : mr @entity6 also has @entity77 lyrics inked on his skin and the same angel tattoo as @entity80 unflinching : @entity1 ( left ) created deeply troubled , love - to - hate characters like corrupt policeman @entity82 in @entity10 , who was played by @entity70 ( right ) in last year 's film adaptation mr @entity6 's quotes tattoo begins with a line from @entity10 : ' you can only live in the world you ken [ know ] , the rest is just wishful thinking or paranoia			1
' it ends with a line from @entity9 : ' better to live life as enjoyable and complete an experience as possible , in case death is s * * * e , which i suspect it will be			0

' the @entity118 , who has been in the @entity120 since he was 19 , had his first tattoo a month before joining up in memory of his late grandfather			0
he added : ' it started with the @entity80 angel one and i also got some quotes from the band @entity77 on my back			1
' born and raised in @entity25 , @entity1 is now recognised as one of @entity131 's most successful authors			0
when @entity9 was published in 1993 , it allegedly failed to make the @entity134 shortlist because its unflinching depictions of drugs and sex offended the sensibilities of two female judges .			0
