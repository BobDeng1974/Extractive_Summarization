the old @entity1 siege mentality has returned ahead of their important encounter against @entity4 on sunday which the club need to win to keep @entity7 football a realistic proposition			1
manager @entity9 , loquacious and engaging for the majority of his two - and - a - half years in charge at @entity12 , has made it clear he has now had enough of the recent criticism and backbiting aimed at him and his players			1
having pushed @entity18 so close to the title last season , @entity1 will kick off against @entity4 – whom they beat 5 - 1 in the corresponding fixture last february – in the bottom half of the @entity25 table			2
@entity9 looks on during his side 's morale - boosting @entity26 win against @entity29 @entity9 , hurt by attacks on his nine summer signings and repeated stories about @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , is taking a leaf out of his predecessor @entity37 's book , drawing ranks and urging his players to prove everyone wrong			1
' seven months ago i was manager of the year , and tactically this and tactically that			2
because we lost two world - class players , one out of the club ( @entity48 ) and one injured ( @entity49 ) , i am useless , ' he said , curtly			2
' football is a critical world			0
for some reason in the modern game , people do n't think new players need time to develop			0
it is not the criticism to me personally ( that angers )			0
i am thinking of the team and the club			0
' the treatment dished out to @entity34 seems to have particularly irked @entity9			1
the 20 - year - old scored his first goals since september in a morale - boosting 3 - 1 @entity26 victory at @entity29 and been given a central attacking role with @entity49 out , and @entity35 and @entity66 failing in front of goal			1
@entity34 runs off to celebrate his first goal of the night as @entity1 beat @entity29 on wednesday night there is uncertainty over @entity34 's long - term future at @entity12 with a new deal unsigned amidst reported interest from @entity75 and @entity76 , but @entity9 – again circling the wagons – has hit out at suggestions the player has taken his eye off the ball after an impressive @entity82			1
' he is another kid who is going to get destroyed , ' warned @entity9			2
' he has just turned 20 years of age , he was the extra log on the fire for us last year , he was outstanding and this year he has been very good			0
' people ask if he is unhappy , you could n't see a happier guy , he is not into discussing deals and money and yet i read about the greedy @entity34			2
' the criticism has been unbelievable , it has been ongoing			0
' @entity9 will doubtless get sympathy from other leading managers about the impatience of supporters and former players - turned - television pundits in sunday 's game when results like last weekend 's 3 - 0 defeat at @entity104 happen			2
@entity105 forward @entity34 runs off to celebrate after giving @entity1 a 3 - 0 lead against the @entity108 side virtually every big - club manager bar @entity110 has been under pressure at some point this season though interestingly we still await our first @entity25 sacking of the season			1
nobody has come under more scrutiny than sunday 's visitor to @entity12 , @entity4 boss @entity120 , who signed a long - term contract at his club in the summer , just like @entity9			1
@entity120 , who lifted the @entity123 in may to end a nine - year trophy drought , has been at @entity4 18 years and has three @entity25 titles , two league and cup doubles , two @entity129 finals and a historic unbeaten season on his record			1
but recently he was abused by his own supporters after a defeat at @entity134 while a banner calling for his departure was held up in the away section at @entity138			0
last season he was filmed and ridiculed for tripping over at a railway station after @entity4 's defeat at @entity12			0
@entity9 comes face - to - face with @entity143 boss @entity120 on sunday at @entity12 ‘ some of the personal stuff he takes is disgraceful , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ he has been an iconic figure , a statesman			0
’ @entity9 will hope the cup triumph will mark a turning point for @entity1 because it represented a return to last season ’s successful format			1
‘ if you look at the speed in our game , the tempo and intensity of our pressing and work was much closer to last season , ’ he said			0
‘ it is a fair point that people are seeing we have n’t been as dynamic as the last couple of years			0
’ @entity9 hopes the 3 - 4 - 3 system he used at @entity165 to accommodate @entity34 as a deep - lying centre forward able to break into space may be a template for better things			1
‘ a @entity171 coach , playing 3 - 4 - 3 ? he must have fell onto that system , a bit of luck , ’ he said sarcastically			0
@entity9 seems to be having fun revealing a more spiky aspect of his nature			2
now the players must follow suit .			0

@entity1 boss @entity9 has had enough of recent criticism
@entity9 has become angered at how much scrutiny his summer signings and young star @entity34 have come under
the *41* - year - old is perplexed as to how he has gone from ' manager of the year to useless ' in just seven months
