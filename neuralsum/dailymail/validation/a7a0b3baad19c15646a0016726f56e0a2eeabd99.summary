@entity1 's @entity0 is following in the footsteps of @entity4 's @entity3 and @entity6 's @entity5 and banning the selfie stick			1
bosses at the @entity0 in the city have begun a crackdown on the popular phone accessories over fears that one wrong move could cause lasting damage to the invaluable artifacts in the ancient palace houses			1
the @entity17 reports that eagle - eyed staff are keeping watch over photo - enthusiasts in the palace 's narrow or crowded areas , as well as all the indoor exhibitions , to avoid any potentially costly accidents			1
@entity25 : the @entity0 has said selfie sticks are no longer allowed inside the exhibition rooms or narrow passageways over concerns an unfortunate accident may occur ' @entity32 sticks will cause safety concerns , whether for tourists or the exhibits , ' @entity34 , deputy director of the museum 's tourist reception department , told @entity39			1
' it may touch the glass exhibition case and cause damage to the cultural relics			0
' she added that as well as being banned in exhibition areas , the sticks would be banned in outdoor areas of the museum - so visitors would be wise not to bother taking them at all			1
however , the sticks will still be allowed outside the palace in the @entity0 - so tourists can still get the all - important shot of the famous 15th century building in the background			2
there was speculation that the move could be the first step to a total ban , as has been implemented at other cultural attractions around the world			0
it is thought the @entity65 in @entity66 will bring in a ban in the next few weeks , while several football stadiums have banned them over fears the extendable devices could be used as a weapon			0
but it seems should the @entity0 instill a total ban in mobile - mad @entity75 - there are said to be 19,300 versions of the selfie stick available on the country 's answer to @entity81 , @entity82 - they would have a fair amount of support			2
popular : @entity75 tourists use ' selfie sticks ' to take pictures as they stand on @entity88 , overlooking the @entity0 , in february			0
there are more than 19,000 versions of the sticks for sale on @entity82 ' museum photos are good for spreading the cultural messages , but we should pay attention to our ways , ' @entity93 , a celebrated @entity94 blogger , told @entity17			0
' i support the museums ' actions on the selfie stick ban			0
