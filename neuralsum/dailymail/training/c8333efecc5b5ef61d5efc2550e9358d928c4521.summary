@entity13 in @entity14 will change its name to something less controversial after the school board voted unanimously to remove @entity19 's name from the school			1
according to the @entity22 , the school was named @entity13 when it opened in 1959 after an organization called @entity24 pushed to commemorate the general			1
the vote : @entity28 superintendent @entity27 watches as the votes of board members come in on his recommend to change the name of @entity13 the first @entity11 : @entity19 was head of the @entity12 from 1866 until 1869 @entity32 , who began the petition , has a daughter who attends school in the district , but told @entity37 he would not allow her to set foot inside a school named after a notorious racist			1
‘ it just would n’t happen , ’ mr @entity32 said			0
‘ i believe it ’s outrageous that this could even be questioned by anybody … that anybody could even come to the defense of this man			0
’ he ’s not alone , the more than 160,000 people who signed his online petition come from all over the country			1
‘ i am very encouraged that [ people ] chose to support this cause and i am humbled by that and excited for change , ’ he continued			1
today , more than half the school 's students are black			0
at the school board meeting monday night , superintendent @entity27 said : ' if you look at the history of the naming of @entity13 , the students originally wanted the school to be named @entity64			1
politics reigned and as a response to desegregation and the civil rights movement , the school was named @entity19			2
that was not the will of the students , and considering the opinion of the students in this process , i think it is an opportunity to give voice to students whose voices were not heard in the beginning and can certainly be heard now			0
commemorated elsewhere : the @entity82 that was erected in @entity83 in 1906 honoring a racist : @entity85 was named after the former @entity12 leader , but residents want that to change a previous attempt to change the school ’s name have somehow failed			1

' @entity111 , the college professor who headed up the 2007 effort , is spearheading this one as well			0
he believes this time the name will change			0
‘ we do n’t want 60 per cent of the kids , black kids , going to a school named for somebody who would ’ve killed them and enslaved them if he had the chance , ’ mr @entity111 told @entity37			2
over 90 per cent of respondents in just under 2,000 door to door surveys conducted by mr @entity111 ’s @entity123 have responded in favor of changing the school ’s name , @entity37 noted			0
the @entity12 : klan members wear ceremonial robes and carry @entity10 flags , in a nod to their past , when marching in protest a further 36 people showed up to last week ’s school board meeting advocating to change the name , according to @entity37			1
some did speak in favor of the name remaining , arguing for mr @entity19 ’s place in history			0
‘ @entity19 , the man , and his association with the @entity12 is history , ’ 1979 graduate @entity140 said , according to @entity37			2
‘ the @entity12 ’s function was much different in his time than it is now			2
