as she bit into a banana , @entity0 noticed some strange spots on its skin			1
at first she thought it was just bruising ... until each tiny mark dropped on to her carpet and scurried off into hiding			1
but while her horror at the creepy - crawly stowaways was bad enough , there was worse to come			2
and worse still , her home could now be infested			1
the female of the species can grow to have a leg span of 6in			2
mrs @entity0 , aged 29 , and her teacher husband @entity36 , 37 , were forced to spend three nights in a hotel with their children , @entity40 , three , and four - month - old @entity41 , while their house was fumigated and deep - cleaned			1
yesterday housewife mrs @entity0 told how her semi-detached home in @entity44 , south - west @entity45 , was invaded by the toxic arachnids			1
' she had taken the fruit from a £ 1 bunch of @entity50 fair trade bananas bought in her local @entity51 , and eaten about half when she noticed the 3mm - long dots that resembled mould or bruising			1
but then she spotted the white nest at the bottom of the fruit			0
‘ i screamed , it was horrible , ’ she said			0
‘ i ’m scared of spiders anyway so i had to get a friend to come round to hoover them up			2
then we cleaned the floor with anti-bacterial wipes			0
’ luckily her son had turned down a share of the banana before he went out to play football			2
at first @entity0 thought her banana was bruised ... until each tiny mark dropped on to her carpet @entity51 ’s gave mrs @entity0 a £ 10 voucher when she returned the fruit , but she insisted on having the spiders identified			1
she sent a picture of the creatures to a pest control company , which quickly named them as ‘ lethal ’ @entity18 wandering spiders – and warned there could still be some lurking in her home			1
@entity82 lists the species as the most toxic spider on earth			0
its venom is said to be 30 times more powerful than that of a rattlesnake			0
humans bitten by one can suffer an irregular heartbeat , high blood pressure , vomiting and eventual death			0
to emphasise its nastiness , the spider ’s scientific name is ‘ phoneutria nigriventer ’ – the first word being @entity99 for ‘ murderess ’			0
hatchlings do not pack the full poisonous punch of mature adults , but the pest controllers advised evacuating the three - bedroom house			2
the family is now back home and @entity51 ’s has paid them £ 2,800 for the inconvenience			1
evacuated : @entity0 and her family were forced to flee their south - west @entity45 home for a hotel @entity51 's paid £ 1,000 to cover the family 's hotel bill , fumigation and dry cleaning now the @entity14 have returned home ( file picture )			1
they were initially offered just a £ 10 voucher yesterday a store spokesman issued an apology , saying : ‘ we do have rigorous controls on imported products at all stages – from harvesting to transportation – which is why this is so rare			1
’ a source at the chain insisted the creatures are unlikely to survive in @entity131 either inside or outside , because they need warmth and humidity			0
mrs @entity0 said : ‘ the pest control people said every living thing in our house is now dead , but i ’m still terrified one is still alive			1
‘ i ’d never heard of @entity18 wandering spiders before all this and i ca n’t imagine what it would be like facing a fully grown one			2
i was trembling and shaking inside when i found out what they can do to you			0
we kill every spider we see in the house now			0
‘ we used to use a postcard and paper cup and carry them outside and put them in the garden , but we ’re killing them all now for our safety and sanity			0
’ she added : ‘ i still like bananas very much , but i ca n’t put my hand near them in the shop any more , so my husband has to buy them for me now			0

pest control firm warned of possible infestation of the deadly spiders
@entity0 saw the tiny spiders jump from the banana she was eating
their home had to be fumigated for three days while they stayed in hotel
*supermarket* initially offered the family a £ 10 voucher following *discovery*
they have since paid £ 1,000 for hotel as well as cleaning and fumigation bills
