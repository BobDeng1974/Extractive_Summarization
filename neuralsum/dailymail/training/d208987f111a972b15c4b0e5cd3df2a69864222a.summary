by @entity0 @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 have many things in common : fame , fortune and fashion credentials			0
they also share a love of an up - and - coming streetwear design duo who , until now , were an unknown brother and sister crafting clothes from their @entity15 bedrooms			2
@entity16 - the label set to take the nation 's wardrobes by storm			2
hot new designer : jaded @entity22 is an urban streetwear brand loved by the likes of @entity4 ( left ) and @entity3 that is set for huge success @entity26 and @entity27 founded @entity16 in the summer of 2013			1
inspired by global street style from @entity22 , @entity29 and @entity30 , the creators set about designing their own take on urban streetwear - and the a-listers ca n't get enough			1
in the past month , @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 and even @entity1 have been spotted sporting the sibling 's designs , something they find hard to comprehend			0
speaking to @entity38 about her overnight success , 25 - year - old @entity26 said : ' i feel overwhelmed by the reaction the brand has had but it has n’t quite sunk in yet especially when i see people walking down the street wearing @entity46			1
' speaking about the history of the brand , which is now stocked in high street mecca @entity47 , @entity26 said : ' we set up @entity16 in the @entity51			1
after two successful years working at @entity52 i decided to use the business skills i had learned , and my commercial eye , to take a big risk and start my own label			0
a-list fan : @entity1 purchased one of @entity26 's tees during her trip to @entity47 in @entity22 while on her mrs @entity62 world tour brains behind the brand : @entity27 and @entity65 , who come from a fashion obsessed family , started the brand last summer ' my family have worked in the fashion industry for three generations so i have grown up around the business and learnt the trade from my father			1
' i saw the growth in the market for streetwear so decided to develop an exciting range for a young demographic			0
my brother @entity27 graduated university at the same time , he has a far better knowledge than me of men 's fashion and trends so we decided to work together to develop a unisex brand			1
' he looks after menswear , which is stocked in @entity88 and @entity89 and i look after womenswear sold in @entity47 , @entity91 and @entity92 ; we have a great working relationship			1
' @entity26 , who describes the range as ' premium streetwear ' , says she was inspired by the catwalk trend for sports luxe , which was seen everywhere from @entity98 to @entity99			2
urban cool : the range embraces the hot sports luxe trend and incorporates bright colours , bold prints and slouchy styles boys and girls : @entity27 looks after the menswear side , which is stocked at the likes of @entity88 , while @entity26 heads up the womenswear ( left , shirt , £ 50 , and , right , skirt , £ 40 ) ' we are developing a handwriting style where people can instantly recognise a @entity16 print , ' she said			1
' we do n't just focus on streetwear , we also produce a lot of going out dresses and glam co-ords			0
jaded is a reactive brand as we have a very quick supply chain so we continuously adapt to current trends			2
' i think the sports luxe trend will stick around as even the big fashion houses like @entity128 are using streetwear as a main focus to their fashion shows and collections			0
' the young designers are already looking to branch out and have their sights set on launching swimwear and festival rain macs this summer and would one day love to develop a jaded perfume or make - up range			2
famous fans : @entity3 , who has been sporting a new signature style lately , is a huge fan of the brand , while @entity2 has worn it too ( right ) ambitious @entity26 - who managed to get her range into @entity47 simply by ' emailing the buying team not thinking i would have a response at such an early stage ' - said of her celebrity fans : ' @entity1 actually bought the @entity151 crop sweat and the @entity153 skirt herself when @entity47 shut down the store for her			1
' @entity3 also purchased the @entity156 tee when shopping in @entity92			0
it is crazy to think they are buying the product for themselves rather than under a stylist 's influence			0
' @entity26 , who would love to see @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 wearing her designs , says you do n't need to be an a-list to pull off her clothes , which are priced between £ 30 - £ 65			1
' we love seeing customers style the @entity121 look themselves and posting pictures on @entity173			0
a lot of people are daring enough to wear the matching co-ords but others style with jeans and plainer tees , ' she said .			0
