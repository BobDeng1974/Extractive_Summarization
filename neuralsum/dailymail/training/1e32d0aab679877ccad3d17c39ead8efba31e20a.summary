for years , millions of women have woken up on @entity1 to be presented with a bouquet by their children , with the stems tied precariously in a bag of water			1
but no longer will they risk an untimely splash , as @entity9 becomes the first @entity11 retailer to deliver flowers in a water - free , airtight container			1
some 160,000 blooms ordered to celebrate the event today will arrive in the new packaging			2
look , no water ! liquid - free flowers for @entity1 have been introduced by @entity9 the move is expected to save 50,000 litres of water this weekend , and almost 500,000 litres over the year			2
the change is thanks to @entity23 , a method similar to vacuum - packing , which keeps flowers fresher for longer			0
this method removes oxygen , so carbon dioxide levels rise , slowing the respiration of the blooms and ‘ putting them to sleep ’ in transit			0
but when unpacked , cut and put in water , the buds ‘ wake up ’			0
the new packaging not only saves water , it reduces carbon footprint			1
such bouquets take up less space and @entity9 says it will need 19 fewer lorries to deliver @entity42 flowers this year			1
the packaging is to be extended to all flowers sold in its stores as part of the company ’s plan to become the world ’s greenest retailer by 2015			0
water pain ! for too long mothers have had to flinch and await and almighty splash as they unwrap flowers			0

no longer must @entity1 stems be *perched* in a bag of water
chain has become first high *street* retailer to deliver water - free blooms
*bosses* say it reduces carbon footprint - with 19 fewer lorries needed today
