pope @entity0 today launched a scathing attack on economic injustice and the ' throwaway culture ' of globalisation pope @entity0 has launched a fresh attack on economic injustice , condemning the ' throwaway culture ' of globalisation and calling for new ways of thinking about poverty , welfare , employment and society			1
in a speech to the association of @entity17 cooperative movements , he pointed to the ' dizzying rise in unemployment ' and the problems that existing welfare systems had in meeting healthcare needs			1
for those living ' at the existential margins ' the current social and political system ' seems fatally destined to suffocate hope and increase risks and threats , ' he said			1
the @entity30 - born pope , who has often criticised orthodox market economics for fostering unfairness and inequality , said people were forced to work long hours , sometimes in the black economy , for a few hundred euros a month because they were seen as easily replaceable			2
'' you do n't like it ? go home then			2
what can you do in a world that works like this ? because there 's a queue of people looking for work			2
if you do n't like it , someone else will , ' he said in an unscripted change from the text of his speech			0
' it 's hunger , hunger that makes us accept what they give us , ' he said			0
his remarks have special resonance in @entity17 , where unemployment , particularly among young people , is running at record levels after years of economic recession			1
the cooperative movement in @entity17 , whose roots go back to 19th century workers ' associations , have long had close ties to the @entity69 , with credit services , agricultural and building co-ops forming an important part of the overall economy			2
pope @entity0 said they could help find new models and methods that could be an alternative model to the ' throw - away culture created by the powers that control the economic and financial policies of the globalised world			1
' perhaps mindful of a wide - ranging corruption scandal linked to some cooperatives in @entity87 last year , he attacked those who ' prostitute the cooperative name '			0
pope @entity0 meets a woman and young girl during today 's meeting with the association of @entity17 cooperative movements pope @entity0 ' remarks had particular resonance in @entity17 , which is suffering from high levels of unemployment pope @entity0 receives a present from a well - wisher at today 's meeting at the @entity101 but his overall message was that economic rationale had to be secondary to the wider needs of human society			1
' when money becomes an idol , it commands the choices of man			0
and thus it ruins man and condemns him			0
it makes him a slave , ' he said			0
' money at the service of life can be managed in the right way by cooperatives , on condition that it is a real cooperative where capital does not have command over men but men over capital , ' he said .			0
