the @entity8 follows an extreme interpretation of @entity83 which is anti-western , promotes sectarian violence and targets those that do not agree with its interpretations as infidels and apostates			2
the @entity8 's announcement of a caliphate claims the land from @entity93 in @entity77 to @entity94 in @entity14 , the @entity76 - dominated areas of both countries			1
eventually , it aims to establish a salafist - orientated @entity98 state spanning @entity14 , @entity77 and other parts of the @entity101			1
the cleaner apparently objected to the symbol he was wearing and @entity10 claims the cleaner actually threatened him			2

the 19 - year - old was reportedly kicked out of the shopping centre by security but allegedly came back an hour - and - a - half later and further abused the cleaner the ' black flag of jihad ' as used by various organisations since the late 1990s consists of a white - on - black shahada instead she said they spent two ' boring ' hours talking about fighting in @entity77 and the @entity8 organisation			1
' he was like a lamb brought to slaughter , ' @entity22 said of her client			0
before the @entity160 discussion , fronted by journalist @entity158 , aired @entity22 told @entity23 her client walked out because ' the whole set up was a farce and they duped guests as to the theme '			2
@entity10 believes @entity166 are obligated to help fellow @entity166 overseas and reportedly does not feel connected with his home country of @entity72			2
' then again perhaps we should not be worried as nobody watches @entity31 unless they are looking for soft porn on a friday night			2

she said there had been a breach of contract as she was given the impression the show would focus on the unfairness of the process that led to the cancellation of @entity10 ’s passport			1
@entity10 is by no means alone in @entity12 with his blatant support for the @entity8 , an @entity14 and @entity77 - based @entity76 extremist group and former @entity79 affiliate that adheres to the global jihadist ideology			1

mr @entity144 is concerned that the 150 @entity72 involved in conflicts in @entity77 and @entity14 may bring their radicalised view of @entity83 back to @entity72			2
' the last thing we should be is complacent about this , ' mr @entity144 said			0
earlier , in an interview with @entity252 , he urged moderate @entity166 to join the ' @entity254 ' fight against locally - bred extremists			0

' he was also asked about reports that shops in @entity12 's southwest were flying islamic state flags despite the group being listed as a terrorist organisation			0

‘ it might stop them from going overseas and fighting but they can still plot attacks from @entity72 , ’ he said			2
the 40 - year - old explained fighting terrorism is not just an issue for the police , @entity17 or the @entity220 community			1
' it ’s not something that 's going to go away			0
people 's beliefs do n't go away			0
you 're investigating a belief system and what is driving them is their beliefs			0
it ’s not like drug crimes that are motivated by money or greed			0
it ’s hard to police			0
’ he also noted that cancelling passports does not necessarily stop people from travelling to @entity77 and @entity14 to join the @entity8 fighting			1

@entity343 , the former judge who presided over the trial of the @entity345 , told @entity23 in general terms that there are a number of factors that lead younger people on the path of extremism			0
' sometimes they come under the influence of a fanatical sheik or imam , that 's what happened with @entity178			0
' the second thing is a bit of peer pressure from young people who are equally angry and probably a bit equally angry and probably a bit disturbed and deprived			0
