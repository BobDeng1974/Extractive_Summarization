@entity0 admits @entity2 's one - day side are not at their best ahead of friday 's @entity6 decider against @entity7			1
whichever side wins at the @entity9 will go on to meet @entity10 in the the final 48 hours later , while the losers head into @entity12 month on a low note			1
the odi rankings favour @entity0 's men , who are second to @entity7 's fifth , but that counted for little when the teams met in @entity18 last week			1
@entity2 captain @entity0 , pictures in action against @entity7 last week , calls for improvement from his side @entity0 has declared he is not satisfied with the performance of his side leading up tot he @entity12 a springy @entity27 deck played into @entity7 's hands as @entity2 collapsed for 153 en route to a nine - wicket thrashing			1
and captain @entity0 recognises the need for an improved showing			1
' i 'm not really ( satisfied ) , but it does n't always go as planned , ' he said			0
' i have been in this position quite a few times			0
we know what needs to be done and ultimately what 's important is for the guys to take that extra responsibility because you just need that spark , that 10 - 15 minutes and everything falls back into the right place			0
' @entity0 walks after edging a @entity46 delivery during the nine - wicket defeat by @entity7 @entity48 , @entity2 's big - hitting batsman , will again be missing as he recovers from a hamstring injury , placing further spotlight on the misfiring batting order			1
@entity53 man @entity53 's continued deployment at number four and a perceived lack of firepower lower down the order have both been criticised and @entity0 has his own concerns about the line - up			2
' the reason why @entity53 is batting at number four is the strength of the middle order and the lower middle order , ' @entity0 said			0
' in the middle order we have lost too many wickets and that really hampers the plan because if you get off to a good start and you have a good partnership then you do n't want wickets to fall in pairs			0
@entity0 and @entity10 's @entity73 ( centre ) out for the toss before monday 's match was abandoned due to rain ' that is what is happening to us so if we can avoid that then everything will be good			2
' if i am batting at six and i am worrying about the batsmen coming after me , whether they can or can not play eight to 10 overs ... if i look to play a big shot and if i get out , whether we will be able to capitalise or not ... that 's the reason why @entity53 has to bat four			0
' @entity0 went on to query @entity7 's apparent edge over @entity2 , suggesting the previous result and the nature of the @entity90 pitch would not be factors			1
' they had the psychological advantage in the @entity94 last year in @entity7 as well ( when @entity2 won the series ) , ' he said with a smile			2
' and in @entity90 is not like the ball comes off 15 or 20kmph faster			0
whoever bowls 140kmph bowls only 140kmph			0
