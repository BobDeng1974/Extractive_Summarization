@entity0 has warned @entity1 that @entity3 are ‘ sharpening the blade ’ ahead of saturday ’s @entity4 semi-final having made easy meat of @entity7			1
@entity3 thrashed the @entity9 champions 37 - 5 in the last - eight tie at the @entity11 and - with a place at the @entity14 final in sight - the @entity17 outfit are now plotting the downfall of the @entity20 ’s second best side			1
both clubs are going in search of their first - ever @entity24 crown and , after leaving @entity25 in search of continental success last summer , @entity0 is determined to deliver another perfect performance in @entity29			1
@entity0 says @entity3 are relishing @entity4 semi-final against @entity7 ‘ the plan is to replicate the @entity7 display , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ people talk about it as the complete performance , but we should always expect to deliver that sort of intensity , accuracy and execution			2
it was n’t a surprise to me			2
‘ there is an expectation on us but we can use that as a positive - we ’re in a good place at the moment			2
we got some quality training in at the start of this week and we can really sharpen the blade on thursday and friday			2
when saturday comes , everyone is on the same page to deliver and execute			0
’ despite this weekend ’s fixture being played at a ‘ neutral ’ venue , @entity3 are expecting more supporters than at a typical sell - out fixture at their 18,000 - capacity home ground			1
it is a 90 - mile drive from the industrial town to the @entity61 , where the top 14 side are aiming to make amends for last year ’s semi-final defeat at the hands of @entity1			1
@entity3 are aiming to make amends for last year ’s semi-final defeat at the hands of @entity1 ‘ for 18,000 people to make that much noise in the quarter - final was quite special , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ hopefully they ’ll be even louder in @entity29			0
the home crowd put out a rallying call ; it ’s a very proud area and there are expectations			0
‘ it ’s nice to have that burden of making sure you deliver			0
over the last few years we have n’t done that , but this year there is an edge and clarity			2
it ’s good to draw on past experiences to help with the now			0
we all know what we want to achieve			0
’ according to @entity0 , the @entity3 gameplan is simple : build an early lead , ease the pressure and force @entity1 to run the ball rather than kick			1
the 27 - year - old wants to nullify the aerial threat of half - backs @entity94 and @entity96 , with @entity98 ’s return to the bench adding to yesterday ’s good news that @entity101 has signed a long - term contract extension			1
@entity3 thrashed @entity9 champions @entity7 in the previous round while @entity1 are flying the @entity9 flag in @entity107 ’s premier competition , @entity104 are preparing to face @entity108 in the second - tier @entity109			1
having overcome @entity110 and @entity7 front - row @entity111 in the scrum on sunday , it will be another chance for @entity116 tight - head @entity115 to impress			1
the @entity118 - born chief trained with @entity25 during the @entity119 , however he is still eligible to play for @entity120			2
@entity121 has earmarked the 22 - year - old for the @entity123 but - while his loyalties now sway towards @entity25 – 21st2lb @entity115 would be open to a phonecall from the @entity120 coaches			1
‘ i have spoken to @entity120 in the past but no real conversations , ’ revealed @entity115			0
‘ back in the autumn , they said i was on the radar			0
@entity25 were in touch around the same time , but my body was not ready for the next step up from the @entity134			0
‘ at the minute , @entity25 are the ones in touch			0
if it came around then i would be happy to speak to @entity136 and i would have to think about it again			0
growing up i probably dreamt of playing for @entity120 , but i have already been to train with @entity25 so there is a loyalty towards them now			0
