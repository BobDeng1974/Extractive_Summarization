pupils have to wear hijabs in and out of class for the first time at a state - backed school in @entity6			1
the cover - up was ordered at the 800 - pupil @entity8 where students already have to dress in long purple tunics over black trousers to ensure flesh is not seen			1
under the rules , pupils must ' wear the hijab outside the school and home , recite the @entity19 at a least once a week ' and not have stationery which shows ' unislamic images ' like pictures of pop stars			1
order : pupils at the @entity26 in @entity6 , have been forced to wear a hijab in and out of class			0
file photo rules : ten per cent of the sixth - form students at the @entity33 , pictured , already wear the niqab which covers the face except the eyes ten per cent of the students in the sixth - form wear the niqab veil which covers the face except the eyes			1
the voluntary - aided school is the flagship of the @entity45 charitable trust which wants to open 12 @entity47 free schools across the country			1
three have been approved so far with one in @entity50 opening this month , despite concerns raised by a former government advisor on the prevention of terrorism			0
@entity55 told the @entity56 : ' i think it threatens to create young @entity59 muslims who are not able to integrate in the wider society , who are living in isolation and outside the wider community			0
' in a statement on the school website headmaster @entity64 said : ' this story is wrong			0
it is totally incorrect to say that pupils are ' forced ' to wear hijab outside of school			1
' we are extremely sorry that despite repeated attempts by us to make sure the @entity56 got their facts right , this newspaper chose to wilfully misrepresent our school			0
' backing : appearing on the @entity78 today , @entity77 said institutions should be free to rule on face - covering veils meanwhile , @entity77 said today the state should back institutions such as schools , courthouses and immigration centres which require individuals to remove face - covering veils			1
hidden : a @entity47 woman wearing a niqab walking in @entity91 mr @entity77 said he did not believe there should be a ban on wearing the niqab - which conceals the whole face - in the streets			1
but he made clear he was ' happy ' to look at the issue of whether the state needed to do more to back up institutions which choose to implement a ban			0
mr @entity77 told @entity101 's @entity78 : ' we are a free country and people should be free to wear whatever clothes they like in public or in private			1
' but we should support those institutions that need to put in place rules so that those institutions can work properly			1
' so for instance in a school , if they want that particular dress code , i believe the government should back them			2
the same for courts , the same for immigration			2
' i think we should back those institutions that want to have sensible policies that actually have a particular purpose			0
' asked if he would respond to a judge 's suggestion that there should be national guidelines on the wearing of the niqab in court , mr @entity77 said : ' i 'm very happy to look at that			2
' obviously , in court the jury needs to be able to look at someone 's face			0
i 've sat on a jury , that 's part of what you do			0
' when someone is coming into the country , an immigration officer needs to see someone 's face			2
' in a school , it 's very difficult to teach unless you can look at your pupils in the eye			0
' it 's a free country and i think a free country should have free and independent institutions			0
no plans for anything on the street , but if the government needs to do more to back up institutions , then i would be happy to look at that			2

strict rules for *girls* who already wear long purple tunics over black trousers so no flesh is exposed
@entity77 says government should backs institutions like school , courts and immigration centres on banning face - covering veils
