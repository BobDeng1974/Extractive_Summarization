@entity0 says @entity1 are ready for the home straight and wants to avoid a photo finish in the relegation battle			1
the boss takes his @entity7 thoroughbreds to @entity8 on saturday for a crunch clash			1
the @entity8 are a point and a place ahead of fourth - bottom @entity1 , who themselves are just three points above the drop zone			1
@entity0 hopes the @entity7 relegation battle does not end up being a photo - finish and with the @entity17 on friday , @entity0 is hoping @entity1 , who have never been relegated from the @entity7 , can avoid being unseated			1
he said : ' i think it 'll be a photo finish and i hope we 're not in it			1
' we 're probably just coming around the corner but it 's probably the longest run - in in racing history			0
' all we 're looking at is the next fence and that 's @entity8			2
after that we hope we can stay in the running			0
there might be a few who fall along the way and we 're hoping that 's not us			0
' @entity1 have won their last two under @entity0 , beating @entity36 twice in the league and the @entity38 to reach the semi-finals			1
they were the new manager 's first wins since replacing @entity42 in february and @entity0 has been impressed with the squad 's attitude			2
' they 've been good and a win makes an awful lot of difference			0
they have been focused and up for the fight , ' he said			0
' they have n't dwelt on the position			0
it 's about looking forward now , what we have done previously counts for nothing			0
' @entity0 , before becoming head coach , was at @entity58 as assistant first - team coach under @entity60 and worked with @entity8 striker @entity61 at @entity62			1
the 32 - year - old returned to @entity64 in january after a year with @entity65 in @entity66 and @entity0 believes @entity61 is the @entity8 ' chief threat			1
he said : ' if they are going to survive it 's going to be @entity61 who keeps them in the @entity7 , that 's why they forked out that sort of money for him			2
' he did n't have to go , he went for a lifestyle change to @entity75 but he still has that appetite to come back and play for @entity8 , in a relegation battle			2
' @entity61 can score goals on his own but he prefers people to slide the ball across the six - yard box for him to be in the right place at the right time , that 's what he 's done all of his career			0
