@entity0 will battle @entity1 and @entity2 for the @entity3 in @entity4 on monday night			1
here , @entity5 argues why the @entity7 and @entity8 superstar should be crowned the world 's best player			2
‘ @entity0 broke another record yesterday ... ’ how many times have those words been written , read , or dropped into conversation since the great @entity0 won his first @entity3 six years ago ? on monday he can win an unprecedented fifth			1
and to sum up why , just look at the 27 - year - old 's records between january 1 and december 31 , 2014 : and we could name more			1
@entity7 's @entity0 holds up a trophy after being honoured for breaking @entity21 's goalscoring record @entity0 became the all - time top goalscorer in @entity21 history in 2014 and received the trophy on sunday @entity0 , right was on target - with @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 ( centre ) - in sunday 's win over @entity28 53 - games in 2014 4,748 - minutes played 49 - goals 15 - goals with right foot 32 - goals with left foot 2 - headers 96.90 - minutes per goal 17 - assists this is why the @entity3 was established by magazine , @entity35 , back in 1956 when sir @entity36 won it first : to recognise the history - makers			1
what we ’re led to believe by @entity40 is the criteria calls for national managers , captains and journalists to vote for the most outstanding performer of the previous 12 months			0
yet this was no ordinary year			0
@entity0 ’s name on the ballot had @entity1 and @entity2 for competition			1
excessive criticism reared its ugly head at times , but the architect of @entity7 and @entity8 was unfazed			2
in @entity21 , @entity0 scored 35 goals in 36 matches			2
broken down to 11 with the right foot , 23 with the left , the other with the head , despite the odd injury			0
@entity1 scored 38 but was less versatile , getting four with his unfavourable left foot and head			2
yet he is the dribbler , the creator , the orchestrator , right ? not entirely			0
there ’s a statistic for that , too			0
@entity0 created 97 chances in @entity21 during 2014 - 24 more than any other player - and completed 164 dribbles - 63 more than his nearest rival			1
not @entity1 , but @entity74 ’s @entity73			2
@entity0 created 97 chances in @entity21 during 2014 - 24 more than any other player - and completed 164 dribbles @entity7 's @entity0 celebrates with team - mates after setting a @entity21 goalscoring record of 253 click here as @entity80 argues why @entity81 goalkeeper @entity2 should win it carried to @entity83			1
@entity0 , channelling his inner @entity84 , conquered @entity86 , @entity87 , on november 25 to become the all - time top goalscorer in the @entity89			1
it was his 23rd @entity83 city , his 16th @entity83 country , and a record 24th different stadium in which he had scored			2
the world 's media ran out of ways to describe him			0
' @entity98 ! there are no limits to this extra-terrestrial , ' ran one headline			0
' a miracle , ' ran another			0
all this , just about the time @entity3 votes were being submitted			2
and so to @entity109 between june 12 and july 13			0
was he to be @entity8 ’s modern - day @entity111 circa 1986 ? the running joke was the @entity7 boy had such sway over @entity116 that he could make tactical calls			1
the hearsay being @entity0 told the @entity8 manager to change to 4 - 3 - 3 against @entity120 at half - time in their @entity123 opener on june 15 , and he obliged			1
was it true ? probably not			0
@entity0 single - handedly broke the hearts of the @entity120 , then the @entity128 , then the @entity129			1
@entity8 's @entity0 celebrates scoring his side 's goal against @entity120 in @entity109 @entity0 and @entity8 ultimately could not win the @entity132 but the @entity7 boy carried them to the final @entity0 receives the @entity3 award for being recognised as the tournament 's best player in @entity109 @entity0 and @entity2 ( left ) after the 2014 world cup final , which the @entity7 star narrowly lost click here as @entity141 argues why @entity142 superstar @entity1 should win do the maths and his four goals directly contributed seven points			1
the difference between qualifying and going home , tails tucked between legs			0
@entity0 carried @entity8 to the @entity132 final			1
yet that ’s where it ended			0
@entity2 won it , but was not necessarily better than the 10 @entity156 in front of him			2
@entity1 , meanwhile , was cursing his luck in @entity160 the @entity3 , reserved for the tournament 's best player , went to @entity0 , though not without scrutiny , even from ' a little surprised ' @entity40 president @entity164			1
yet he got to @entity165 , and was crowned most outstanding player on the world stage after winning four man - of - the - match awards towards the final			0
it is perhaps a symptom of being the best			0
when so much is expected , failure is practically unacceptable			0
his four - year reign over the @entity3 ended in @entity4 last year , cutting some figure in a red suit and black bow tie			1
@entity1 , rightly , had his turn , and @entity0 had 2014 to fix it			2
this is no slanging match			0
all three candidates , in their own way , have a right to win the famous , old trophy			0
but , come monday night , when he could win an unprecedented fifth @entity3 , maybe that same , old phrase will resurface the next morning : ‘ @entity0 broke another record yesterday ... ’ @entity0 and partner @entity189 arrive during the @entity3 awards last year in january @entity0 will be looking to win an unprecedented fifth @entity3 against @entity1 and @entity2			1
