the chairman of a @entity2 committee investigating the 2012 terror attacks in @entity4 , @entity5 , said tuesday that he wants to interview @entity6 by may 1			1
that timeframe would put the next round of what ' been called ' email-gate ' in the middle of @entity13 's likely timetable for announcing a presidential campaign			1
@entity16 @entity15 rep. @entity15 , the @entity4 committee 's chairman , said in a letter to @entity13 's lawyer that a recorded and transcribed interview would help the committee better understand decisions @entity13 made ' relevant to the creation , maintenance , retention , and ultimately deletion of public records ' — namely her emails during the four years she was secretary of state			1
at that point , he continued , the committee would consider calling her to testify under oath in an open , public hearing			2
scroll down to read @entity36 's demand letter deadline : @entity6 has until may 1 to sit down with congressional investigators and discuss her use of a private email address from 2009 to 2013 – along with what happened to tens of thousands of her messages @entity43 : @entity15 , a @entity16 @entity44 congressman who was a hard - nosed prosecutor before winning his seat in @entity46 , is calling the shots but has limited authority and ca n't subpoena @entity13 's computer hardware @entity15 announced friday that @entity13 's attorney , @entity50 , said she had wiped her private email server ' clean ' and permanently deleted all emails from it			1
@entity13 , a likely @entity55 presidential candidate , exclusively used a private email account and her own server during her tenure at @entity60 from 2009 to 2013			1
her spokesman @entity61 told the @entity62 on tuesday that @entity13 told @entity15 's committee months ago that she was ready to appear at a public hearing			1
' it is by their choice that has n't happened , ' @entity61 said			0
' to be clear , she remains ready to appear at a hearing open to the @entity71 public			0
' @entity2 press secretary @entity72 put some distance between @entity13 and the @entity75 administration on tuesday afternoon , referring to her as a ' private citizen			2
' the lawyer : @entity50 , whose service to the @entity80 goes back past president @entity13 's impeachment and all the way back to his days as @entity84 governor , is catching legal spears for @entity6 as ' email-gate ' grows ' this will obviously be a discussion for the leaders in that committee and @entity6 and her team to have , so i do n't have an opinion on it , ' @entity72 told reporters in his daily briefing			1
asked if @entity13 should ultimately sit with @entity44 for an in - person grilling , he replied : ' that will be a decision for her to make			1
' @entity72 contended that the @entity2 has provided the committee with enough information			2
' we certainly have , ' he claimed tuesday			0
but @entity13 has refused @entity15 's request to turn over her email server , housed at her upstate @entity106 home , to a third party for an independent review			1
if the secretary continues to reject the offer of a neutral review , ' @entity15 wrote in his letter to @entity50 , ' the @entity109 as a whole will need to consider its next steps			0
' @entity50 said friday that @entity13 has already turned over to the @entity116 all work - related emails , about 30,000 in all			2
@entity15 , however , said @entity13 lacked the authority to determine what was and was n't a government document subject to archiving			0
@entity13 confirmed in a press conference this month that she deleted the rest , more than 32,000 emails			0
@entity2 press secretary @entity72 seemingly cut @entity6 loose on tuesday , calling her a ' private citizen ' and saying it was up to her to decide whether or not to cooperate connected : @entity6 was never far from her mobile smartphone as secretary of state , but only her closest confidantes knew the device was communicating with a private email server at her house – not a government system at the @entity116 @entity50 also said it would be pointless for @entity13 to turn over her server , since ' no emails ... reside on the server or on any backup systems associated with the server			1
' but technical experts cited in news reports point out that the same argument was made early in an investigation of former @entity146 official @entity145			0
@entity145 was accused of conspiring to user her authority to slow - walk or deny tax - exemption applications filed by conservative nonprofits in order to put them at a political disadvantage			0
she claimed a hard - drive crash wiped out years of her email traffic , but the @entity146 inspector general later found usable archives covering large portions of the missing material			2
@entity15 said tuesday that it is technically possible in many instances to recover electronic information that has been deleted or overwritten			0
' it is precisely for this reason a neutral and objective party must have access to the server and related equipment to identify information potentially responsive to relevant laws and investigative requests , ' he wrote in a letter to @entity50			0
@entity15 also reminded @entity50 that the server and any associated information , data , backups and equipment ' must be preserved wherever they reside and that any further deletion or destruction of data or information must cease			0
' rep. @entity181 of @entity182 , the top @entity183 on the @entity4 panel , said @entity13 agreed to testify months ago , in public and under oath , ' so the @entity187 's claim that it has no choice but to subject her to a private staff interview is inaccurate			1
' rather than drag out what he called a ' political charade , ' @entity181 said , the committee should schedule a public hearing with @entity13 , make her email public ' and re-focus its efforts on the attacks in @entity4			1
' four @entity71 were killed in the september 2012 attacks , including @entity71 ambassador to @entity5 @entity201			0
gowdy letter to @entity6 's lawyer about email-gate uploaded by @entity204			2

her spokesman *insists* she 's ready to testify in public about ' email-gate '
first step would be a recorded and transcribed interview with *lawmakers* and their lawyers
@entity44 chairman of committee investigating 2012 @entity4 terror attacks wants a third - party expert to examine @entity13 's email server
@entity13 has refused , with her lawyer *admitting* she had wiped it clean
@entity44 demand an interview by may 1 , a deadline that could *complicate* @entity13 's plan to announce a presidential run
@entity2 distances itself from the *conflict* , putting *responsibility* on @entity13 to butt heads with @entity44 on @entity234
