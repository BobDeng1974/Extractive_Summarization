' the man who put himself in charge of disclosing the world 's secrets simply could n't bear his own			0
the story of his life mortified him and sent him scurrying for excuses			0
he did n't want to do the book			0
he had n't from the beginning , ' he said			0
as the deadline approached , @entity4 was ' totally shocked ' at the idea of his story being told , and he branded people who write about their family as ' prostitutes '			2
his lawyers had persuaded him to publish it , arguing that the royalties would help with his rising legal bill			0
@entity4 was initially enthusiastic , and told @entity14 he hoped the book would read ' like @entity61 '			1
' mansion arrest ' : the @entity64 stately home where @entity4 and some of his supporters lived for a time			0
he later felt the @entity30 had gone from a collaborator to an enemy @entity17 , fed up with @entity4 increasingly not co-operating , published a version of @entity14 's manuscript , @entity4 : the @entity71 in september 2011			1
@entity4 had not given his consent			0
but this did not stop him covertly encouraging sales and tweeting links to its @entity77 page			0
the book sold fewer than 700 copies in its first week - a disaster			0

endorsement : @entity102 , pictured here with his brother and successor @entity104 ( right ) , and @entity107 's late president @entity106 , said apparently told @entity4 that @entity10 was the only website he liked on his first visit to the country house , @entity14 was met by @entity4 in stockinged feet			1
@entity4 that him he might be in jail soon and that might not be bad for writing the book			2
@entity115 : @entity17 assigned @entity14 , whose 1999 book @entity116 was shortlisted for the @entity15 @entity14 said that during the @entity118 uprising , when president @entity119 tried to close the country 's phone network @entity4 and other staffers hacking into the system from their @entity64 kitchen table to reverse the shutdown , then leant back to eat chocolates as the revolution continued			1
@entity14 was told that former @entity128 president @entity102 had sent a message to say @entity10 was the only website he liked			2

when a group of company presidents offered @entity4 £ 20,000 for an hour 's @entity136 time , he said : ' if @entity138 - a war criminal - can get £ 120,000 , i should get at least £ 1 more than him			2

in his view ' the @entity30 was an enemy because he 'd ' given ' them something and they had n't toed the line , whereas the @entity149 was almost respected for finding him entirely abominable			0
' @entity14 described feeling torn betwen ' a kind of loyalty to @entity4 's vulnerability , especially ( not in spite of ) his role as enemy to himself ' , and regarding him as a @entity157 figure , ' the lost boy of @entity159 with his silver hair and his sense that the world of adults is no real place for him ' .			2
