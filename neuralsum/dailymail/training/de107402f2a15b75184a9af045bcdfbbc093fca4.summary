by @entity0 one of @entity2 ’s chief opponents has said his ‘ blokeish attitude ’ has put women off him during the referendum campaign on @entity6 independence			1
@entity8 , @entity9 ’s spokesman on @entity6 , was speaking after a poll found 51 per cent of women plan to vote against independence			1
only 32 per cent of female voters said they planned to vote in favour , and 17 per cent were still undecided			1
bloke : @entity2 has been accused of putting off women , more of whom plan to reject @entity6 independence among men , 41 per cent said they would vote yes , 48 per cent would vote no and 11 per cent were undecided , according to the poll by @entity18			1
the poll showed the campaign to save the @entity21 has more than doubled its lead to a record high since the tv debate between mr @entity2 and pro-union @entity25 last tuesday when the @entity28 leader failed to answer key questions about the pound			1
miss @entity8 said : ‘ this blokeish attitude does n’t work with people , especially women			1
i do n’t think his recent performances have done him any favours			0
’ women also voted in lower numbers than men for mr @entity2 ’s @entity28 during the 2011 elections – when the party promised a referendum on independence			2
but earlier this month miss @entity8 said there was some ‘ very negative ’ reaction to mr @entity2 personally on the doorstep , amid a continuing row about the currency			1
she said : ‘ people believe he is so blinded by his dedication to independence that he ’s thinking about that rather than their interests , and voters always expect you to think more about their interests			1
’ @entity9 's @entity56 added : ' the @entity28 have failed to have a message to women that works ' women in particular , she said , were more likely to vote no , because they felt a ‘ wider responsibility ’ for others			1
‘ they have to think of their family , children , grandchildren and wider community ’ , she said			0
‘ the @entity28 have singularly failed to have a message to women that works			0
’ the poll of 1,010 @entity6 found that 57 per cent plan to vote no next month , a 14 - point lead over @entity71 , once the ‘ do n’t knows ’ are excluded			1
this compares with a six - point lead last sunday			2
it is the first time the no vote has exceeded 50 per cent since @entity18 began asking the question			2
yesterday it emerged mr @entity2 has refused to commission any research into a separate currency – despite @entity81 politicians ruling out sharing the pound with an independent @entity6			0
it led to taunts from his rivals that he had admitted he had no ' @entity86 '			0
the @entity87 turned down a @entity89 request by the @entity90 asking for all reports , correspondence and briefings on a new currency			0
it admitted it does not hold the information because the government ‘ proposes that currency will continue to be the currency of an independent @entity6 ’			0
a row deepened also yesterday about the use of taxpayer - funded literature backing the independence campaign			2
last week all 2.5million households in the country received a 12 - page glossy government booklet entitled ‘ @entity6 ’s future – what independence means for you ’			2
it claimed that ‘ we will get the government that @entity6 votes for – every time ’ , a key @entity28 message , and that life would be ‘ easier for families ’ with more financial security			0
this is despite major firms saying they would quit @entity6 with thousands of job losses if it went independent , and research from the respected @entity123 warning an independent @entity124 would have to raise taxes or slash spending			0
the @entity127 campaign also has literature funded by the @entity129			0
but critics accused the @entity6 civil service of becoming ‘ politicised ’ and refusing to reveal how much was spent on promotional materials .			0

@entity8 claimed there was ' very negative ' reaction on doorstep
@entity9 spokesman added : ' this blokeish attitude does *n't* work with people '
poll shows 32 **%** of female voters will vote yes - compared to 41 **%** of men
