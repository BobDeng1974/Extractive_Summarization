call to action : @entity1 is being urged to help thousands of badly wounded @entity3 veterans @entity1 is being urged to help thousands of badly wounded @entity3 veterans who are being forced to use their war pensions to pay for social care			1
under the rules , veterans injured on or before april 5 , 2005 , must hand over most of their weekly injury compensation payments should they require social care			1
by contrast , service personnel wounded after that date are entitled to keep all their payments because they are paid out of a different @entity15 scheme			1
now the @entity16 , backed by many mps , is calling on the prime minister to correct this anomaly , which penalises veterans of the @entity21 , the @entity22 , @entity23 and both @entity24			1
last night , sir @entity25 mp , a member of the @entity26 ’ @entity27 , said : ‘ it ’s an absurdity that some veterans should be discriminated against in this way			2
so i will be asking the prime minister for an explanation as to who drew up this dividing line and on what basis this date was chosen			0
’ veterans injured in service on or before april 5 , 2005 , receive a @entity39 and are known as @entity40			1
those who have social care needs routinely find councils take all but £ 10 per week of their compensation to cover their care costs			0
this is despite the fact that a veteran with a similar injury who was wounded after the cut - off date is able to keep all of their compensation			2
this is because councils are instructed to fully exempt payments made under the @entity55 ( @entity55 ) from any means testing for social care			2
former submariner @entity57 , 43 , a paraplegic , is forced to give £ 100 per week to meet the costs of his social care , which includes daily visits by a care worker			0
dedicated : the rule penalises veterans of the @entity21 , the @entity22 , @entity23 and both @entity63			0
above , ranks of the rbl march past during the @entity65 in @entity66 normandy veteran @entity67 , 90 , who suffered gunshot wounds in 1944 , apparently has ‘ very little money left over ’ after his council has taken his pension to pay for nursing home fees			0
since 2005 , some 16,000 injured troops have been paid almost £ 341 million in compensation from the @entity55 scheme			2
a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ military compensation is awarded as a recompense for pain , suffering and loss of amenity experienced by injured service personnel and veterans			1
‘ it should not be treated as normal income			0
the system is unfair and has to change			0

some veterans must hand over most of weekly pension if they require care
rules *affect* service personnel injured in service on or before april 5 , 2005
but those wounded after that date are entitled to keep all their payments
