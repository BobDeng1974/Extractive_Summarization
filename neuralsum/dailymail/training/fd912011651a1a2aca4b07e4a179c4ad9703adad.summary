pope @entity0 has once again broken with papal protocol by inviting an old friend for a spin on his famous ' popemobile ' during his weekly audience in @entity6			1
the reverend @entity7 , a parish priest in @entity0 ' hometown of @entity9 , did n't have a vip ticket granting him a seat close to the altar or a spot where the pope would chat with well - wishers			1
but as soon as @entity0 saw @entity7 in the crowd of several thousand people as the priest called out ' @entity20 ' , the pope signaled for @entity22 gendarmes to help @entity7 jump the barricade			2
sat alongside the papal assistant , the priest , from @entity33 of the @entity35 church , accompanied the pope through the square as the head of the @entity34 waved to well - wishers and kissed babies			0
@entity7 said he was shocked by @entity0 ' invitation , telling reporters afterward : ' i said to myself " what am i doing here ? mamma mia ! " ' the pope laughed and said " come , sit down , sit down ! " and he continued to greet the people and kiss babies			0
i was very moved ' @entity7 said the two had known each other since the 1990s ; the former @entity0 was archbishop of the @entity52 capital before being named pope			2
friendly : when @entity0 saw @entity7 in the crowd he signaled for @entity22 gendarmes to help @entity7 jump the barricade and hugging him , invited him aboard the priest later summed up the day on his @entity60 account , writing : ' i â€™m going to change my biography			1
" the poor priest who got on the popemobile today with # @entity64 " ' @entity0 was in particularly good spirits at wednesday 's audience , entertained by a circus troupe and greeted by @entity70 's @entity69 football team , who presented the soccer - mad pope with yet another shirt			2
@entity0 has added a bit of spontaneity to the @entity22 's staid ways			0
he lives in the @entity22 hotel rather than the @entity79 and eschewed the armored popemobile for a simple @entity81 during his trip to @entity83			0
when he has left the @entity22 , he has done so with a minimal security detail and no fancy motorcade			0
all smiles : sat alongside the papal assistant , the priest , from @entity33 of the @entity35 church , accompanied the pope through the square as he waved to well - wishers surprise : @entity7 said he was shocked by @entity0 ' invitation , telling reporters afterward : ' i said to myself " what am i doing here ? mamma mia !
