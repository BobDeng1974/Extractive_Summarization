@entity0 accused @entity1 of endangering the career of @entity3 with a wild lunge in the dying moments of @entity8 's @entity7 victory over @entity9			1
the @entity11 's side strolled into a semi-final meeting with @entity13 by putting four goals past the @entity16 men , yet the third of four successive meetings between the sides was again pockmarked by ill - discipline			1
@entity21 was sent off by referee @entity22 for a swipe at @entity24 before @entity1 was also dismissed for scything down @entity8 sub @entity3 â€“ prompting the sixth red card in three back - to - back meetings			1
@entity1 is sent off by referee @entity22 after he scythed down @entity8 sub @entity3 and a clearly angered @entity0 believes the young @entity28 was fortunate to escape serious injury			1
' it was a red card , ' he insisted			2
' it was a stupid tackle on the sideline			2
we need to get these things out of football			2
' it was a youngster trying a little trick in the corner			0
you could have stayed there and kept him out wide instead of going in with both feet			0
he could have injured him for life			0
' it must have been frustration			0
it was a straight - forward win in the end but there were some angry and disappointed players out there			2
' it got a bit tense at the end but that can happen			0
@entity8 boss @entity0 claimed @entity1 could have injured @entity3 for life with his late challenge ' these have been important games for both teams and sometimes it can get a bit tense			1
' today , we were the better team , like we were on sunday , and they had some frustration			0
we need to handle that and get ready for the next game			0
' @entity0 , who wanted to look at the @entity21 incident before commenting further , isn ' t concerned the ill - feeling will spill over in the fourth encounter between the sides on saturday			1
' i spoke to @entity21 , ' he added			1
' his mouth was bleeding after a challenge from @entity24 and he reacted			1
we have to see it again if it is a red card			2
' i am not concerned for my players			0
we have to be at the same level and get the three points			0
i am delighted to be playing them again			0
' @entity8 eased through at the second attempt thanks to goals from @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86			1
but given the tempestuous nature of the three previous games , @entity84 believes there 's every chance matters might get out of hand when the teams reconvene on league business at @entity95			2
' that 's six red cards in three games now and if i was a betting man then i would be putting money on another sending off this saturday , ' he said			1
@entity21 ( second left ) comes together with @entity1 during an ill - tempered second - half ' it is just one of those things and the @entity9 players are getting a bit frustrated and we move on to saturday and hopefully we can pick up another three points			1
' i do n't think there is niggle between both sets of players			0
i just think @entity9 are sick of the sight of @entity8			1
' we have got them again on saturday and then we do n't see them for a while			0
' @entity9 assistant manager @entity115 believes refereeing decisions have gone against his side in the three games			1
the @entity120 outfit felt @entity121 should have been given a penalty in the @entity123 while @entity124 should have had a second yellow early in the second half last night for a foul on @entity128			0
' the @entity8 reaction on the back of their player being sent off maybe influences the referee ( when @entity1 is sent off ) but i 'll need to look at it again , ' @entity115 said			1
' is it any worse or any different to @entity136 's two weeks ago ? ' asked about @entity124 , @entity115 replied : ' it 's another yellow card			2
we deliberately put @entity128 out there to play on @entity124 because he was on a yellow card			0
@entity0 celebrates at full - time as his side reached the @entity7 semi-finals with a 4 - 0 victory ' i thought it was another yellow card when we were having a reasonable period in the game			1
' they 've gone against us in the last few games			0
we 've spoken about the penalty at the weekend			0
' meanwhile , @entity8 skipper @entity136 says he 's moved on from being photographed seemingly drunk in an @entity153 street four days before the @entity123			1
' i do n't think i 'm the first player to make a mistake and probably wo n't be the last , ' he stated			0
' but i 've spoken to the manager , it 's been dealt with and now all i 'm doing is moving on			2
' i 'm sure the club , the manager and the fans know that my total focus will always be on the matches coming up and nothing else but winning for @entity8			1
' it was a real honour as captain to lift the @entity123 on sunday and we now want to push on and try to bring our fans even more success this season			0
' that 's all we 're thinking about			2
