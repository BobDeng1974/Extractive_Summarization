by @entity0 published : 11:57 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 03:11 est , 23 april 2013 this plastic water bottle is fitted with a @entity4 - inspired filtration system so powerful it can turn cola into clear , colourless liquid , the manufacturers claim			1
@entity9 's ' advanced filtration water bottle ' draws on technology originally developed by @entity4 to ensure the drinker 's every sip is ' pure , fresh and clean '			1
this video footage of the bottle being put to the test shows it being filled with brown @entity16 which , after being poured through the special filter cap , looks exactly like water			1
the footage of the experiment shows how his trial using his own @entity9 bottle yielded the same results at first			2
' the first streams of liquid were completely colourless , but became tinged with brown as i continued to pour , ' his report said			2
' i was a little disappointed that it was n't completely colourless , but pressed on			0
' i took a sip and was again disappointed to find that it was n't tasteless , ' said the tester , who added that it tasted ' like sugar water '			0
the @entity16 experiment on the @entity9 website is aimed at illustrating the effectiveness of the bottle , which is designed to filter water , not other drinks			1
the eco-friendly water container comes in three different filtration levels			1
the @entity74 - 1 filter is carbon based and designed to reduce chlorine and odour from tap water			2
powerful : the filtration system used for the plastic water containers was inspired by @entity4 technology the level - 2 filter contains more than 400 tiny pores and uses a positively charged electro - absorption process to trap harmful agents as water passes through it			1
according to the manufacturer , charge fields activated upon contact with water virtually close the pore to any intruding agents			0
' using built - in silver ions , the material then kills bacteria upon contact , ' the @entity9 website says			0
the third level of filtration is designed for the treatment of known elements in large volumes of water in extreme environments			0
@entity105 is not available to buy at retail .			0
