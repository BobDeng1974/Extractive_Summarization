at the start of the season two teams dominated most predictions for the @entity3			1
yet one of them has probably surpassed expectations and is shaping up to be one of the great @entity3 sides , the other is well below par. i am , of course , referring to @entity12 and @entity13 and last week ’s action in the @entity15 provided a summary of their domestic form			1
@entity12 were superb but it is the team that impresses			1
@entity13 just got there in the end but only @entity21 is really delivering			1
when you analyse where it is going wrong for @entity13 , there are some obvious areas			1
@entity27 clearly is n’t the player he was last season , for whatever reason			1
we ca n’t know for sure but it might have been the loss of his brother , who tragically died in the summer			2
it certainly seems to have gone downhill ever since there was that silly row about his birthday after the summer trip to @entity40			2
only now are some people realising quite how important he was to the whole team			2
@entity12 have been hugely impressive in the @entity3 this season , and are still unbeaten but @entity3 champions @entity13 , and particularly @entity27 , have been disappointing @entity46 was also in sensational form last season but he ’s been injured of late and has n’t quite hit the heights of last season			1
for me , those two were the heart of the midfield ; exceptional players who , with @entity21 in front of them , made the difference			2
@entity59 and @entity60 look like players who come alive when the rest of the team are playing well			0
up front , @entity64 has missed some games through injury and has n’t shared the scoring burden , with only two goals in the @entity3 and do n’t forget they have n’t got @entity71			1
they let him go after his form tailed off in the closing months of last season but by this stage last year he had already scored 12 goals for @entity13 ; seven in the @entity3			1
last week they were very fortunate to stay in the @entity15 with @entity78 ’s last - minute goal and @entity79 going down to 10 men			0
a lot of things happened to keep them in the frame			0
it wo n’t be like that if they make the last 16 — they will have to earn wins the hard way			0
@entity91 won both the league and @entity93 in his first season but looks unlikely to repeat that feat @entity97 's @entity12 side are capable of going toe - to - toe with the best sides in @entity101 football it ’s going to be difficult for @entity13 to spend their way out of this downturn , as they have in the past			1
it looks as though they have been caught out a little by the severity with which @entity109 imposed their @entity111 rules			0
possibly there was a feeling that if they did stumble a little bit , they could go out to buy somebody			0
now the rules have changed so that is a difficulty			0
of course , they still have an incredible squad and resources so i would n’t feel too sorry for them but they have to watch what they spend in january or at least balance the books			0
@entity12 did that magnificently in the summer , even making a profit on their dealings			1
for me , the biggest change there is that you can see @entity97 ’s hand in all the transfers			1
there was a suspicion in the past that it was n’t necessarily football people making the decisions about who should be bought , certainly not when @entity143 came in			0
@entity12 's 5 - 0 demolition of @entity146 side @entity145 shows they have what it takes to win the @entity15 @entity21 celebrates the third goal of his stunning hat - trick against @entity79 but all the major transfers since @entity97 has arrived have brought balance to the team and added quality			1
the players who have made the difference this season have been @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity161 , who was signed in january , and @entity162 , who returned from his loan in @entity164			2
all that was done by the manager			0
he ’s moulded the team into what he wanted			0
@entity171 , it seems as though @entity97 appreciated what the owner , @entity172 , wanted in terms of more stylish football , while the owner appreciates what @entity97 brings to the side			1
their partnership fits hand in glove			0
@entity12 can be sensational to watch even if , like at @entity184 , they can also be quite tight and just take what ’s on offer			2
their work ethic allows individuality to thrive			0
you ca n’t see this @entity12 side not winning the @entity3 title , only injuries to key players might stop them			1
what will be intriguing is how they fare when the @entity15 resumes in february			0
i know they won the tournament in 2012 playing on the counter-attack but in reality we have n’t really had a team in @entity205 in recent years who could genuinely go toe - to - toe with @entity109 ’s very best			0
@entity207 , @entity79 and @entity208 are certainly the strongest at the moment			0
if @entity12 can maintain this kind of form , they might just be the team to challenge those giants .			2

@entity12 have been hugely impressive in the @entity3 this season
but @entity13 have failed to find their rhythm
@entity97 's signings appeared to have his *hallmark* on them
@entity13 may have to *replace* @entity27 soon , but must be *careful* with money
