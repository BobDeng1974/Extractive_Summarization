@entity1 ’s appearance at the @entity2 was dramatically interrupted yesterday when a protester burst in to the chamber and accused him of being a ‘ war criminal ’			1
the former prime minister was giving evidence when 49 - year - old @entity8 emerged through a doorway behind @entity10			1
he shouted : ‘ this man should be arrested for war crimes ’ , gesturing to mr @entity1			1
mr @entity8 claimed that mr @entity1 had been ‘ bought ’ by @entity16 , and that the @entity14 investment bank had profited from the @entity15			1
@entity10 ( standing to the right of the commotion , did not			2
@entity21 ( standing below @entity10 ) held his head in his hands after the protester was bundled out , a furious @entity10 demanded an inquiry into how he had managed to reach ‘ what is supposed to be a secure corridor ’			1
shortly afterwards a cheerful mr @entity8 was marched out of the court and into a van by police officers			1
he was arrested on suspicion of breaching the peace but released without charge after two hours			0
a second man was also held after an egg was thrown at mr @entity1 's @entity35 as he left the @entity36 following his evidence			1
the dramatic earlier disruption echoed that of @entity40 who thrust a custard pie into @entity43 's face during his evidence to a @entity45 last year , provoking wife @entity46 to athletically leap to the mogul 's defence			1
filmmaker and veteran @entity15 protester @entity8 , 49 , who said he was from the @entity50 , shouted to a stunned courtroom : ' @entity16 paid him off for the @entity53 war			1
three months after he invaded @entity53 they held up the @entity53 bank for 20 billion			0
' he was then paid six million dollars every year and still is from @entity16 six months after he left office			2
this man is a war criminal			0
' embarrassing : @entity8 , dressed in a white shirt and chinos , then shouted to the stunned court , ' this man should be arrested for war crimes ' ' completely untrue ' : after peace was restored to the courtroom , mr @entity1 told the court that the man 's accusations were ' completely and utterly untrue ' the drama began when mr @entity8 burst in , having managed to get past security to access the private corridor into courtroom 73			1
as chief counsel @entity21 , who had been leading @entity1 's grilling , held his head in his hands , security guards jumped on the man to stifle the commotion and bundled him out of the chamber			1
mr @entity1 , who is a senior adviser at @entity16 on a reported salary of between £ 500,000 and £ 2.5million , immediately told the court that the man 's accusations were ' completely and utterly untrue '			1
protester : @entity8 was arrested but it was n't his first @entity1 protest			1
he also interrupted a debate on the @entity15 on @entity88 's @entity87 quizzed : @entity8 was taken to a central @entity90 police station for questioning arrested : @entity8 said he was from the @entity50 as he was escorted from the @entity92 police and prosecutors are now deciding whether to press charges against mr @entity8 - @entity8 the father of two , a fierce opponent of the war on @entity53 , has publicly heckled mr @entity1 before , during an episode of the @entity88 ’s @entity87			1
a freelance documentary filmmaker , he is separated from his wife @entity101 and lives alone in @entity102			2
after his release yesterday , he said the security at the inquiry was so lax that he was able to walk straight in through the back			0
‘ i tried to get in through the front entrance but they stopped me			0
i figured @entity10 himself would enter a different way so i walked around , found an empty court and went through the back door of it			2
it was not the first televised @entity116 protest by @entity8			2
the filmmaker and veteran @entity15 protester launched a similar attack during an episode of @entity87 on the @entity88 ( pictured above )			1
posing as a member of the public until he was passed the microphone , he yelled : ' this country is led by liars who are prepared to kill in the name of oil			0
' his outburst was met with rapturous applause			0
he later travelled to @entity53 to make a short film in which he claimed ' to ask its citizens and military personnel whether they agreed with him '			0
the @entity50 then asks : ' should @entity1 be taken to the @entity133 and tried for crimes against peace ? ' following a screening of the film at the @entity138 in west @entity90 in 2010 , he led a debate with former @entity141 mp @entity140 and major general @entity142 , who was commander of the @entity143 during the 2003 invasion of @entity53			2
according to the @entity147 , the film and tv professional was an assistant director on 27 episodes of @entity150 - hosted by @entity151 - and a first assistant director on a 2010 @entity154 documentary entitled @entity155			0
he is currently an assistant director on a new horror movie called @entity157			0
on his @entity161 page , under the section entitled ' political views ' , he writes : ' @entity1 and at least four of his cronies should be behind bars ... ' he once also appeared with anti-iraq war mp @entity165 in a @entity168 radio show last year			2
‘ i walked around and managed to find @entity10 ’s personal @entity169 was no one there so i just went straight in			2
’ mr @entity8 said it was yesterday morning that he had decided to make his gesture on the ‘ @entity174 ’			2
he added : ‘ for evil to carry on it just takes for good men to do nothing			0
whenever @entity1 is in public , there i ’ll be			2
’ @entity10 said he wanted an investigation into how the man got into the court through special access , security - coded doors			1
he said : ' i would like to find out how this gentleman managed to access the court through what 's supposed to be a secure corridor and i 'll have an investigation undertaken about that immediately			0
' mr @entity1 said : ' that 's fine , can i just say for the record that what he said about @entity53 and @entity16 is completely untrue			1
' the man told reporters his name was @entity8 and he was from the @entity50 , he spoke as security guards escorted him through the @entity92			2
when the hearing resumed for the afternoon session , @entity10 said : ' considerable effort has been put into ensuring all witnesses can give their evidence in a safe and secure environment and i very much regret what has happened			0
' an investigation is being undertaken and i will be giving consideration to the steps that can be taken and should be taken against this particular intruder			0
' efforts will be redoubled to ensure that incidents of this nature do n't recur			0
' i repeat my apologies to mr @entity1 and indeed to everyone else who was involved in or following our inquiry			1
' mr @entity1 had been greeted by around two dozen or so protesters as he arrived at the courts			1
they waved banners reading ' @entity222 ' and ' @entity223 out '			0
the close relationship between mr @entity1 and @entity43 was underlined by a list of contacts with newspaper editors and proprietors in the run - up to the @entity15 in 2003			1
three telephone calls were recorded between the pair on 11 , 13 and 19 march 2003			0
he admitted to initiating one of them and that they lasted for now more than 45 minutes in total			0
he said : ‘ i would have been wanting to explain what we are doing			0
i think i had similar calls with the @entity238 and the @entity239			0
i do n't think there 's anything particularly odd about that when you 're facing such an issue			0
’ in the run up to the 1997 general election in which mr @entity1 took power for the first time , @entity244 famously switched its allegiance from the @entity250 and became a vociferous cheerleader for the @entity15			1
earlier , mr @entity1 cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the @entity92 for his grilling at the @entity2			1
arrested : a second man was also held after an egg was thrown at mr @entity1 's @entity35 as he left the @entity36 following his appearance before @entity10 echoes : the interruption was an embarrassing echo of the ' custard pie ' incident when @entity43 was attacked during a @entity45 last year and his wife , @entity46 , leapt to his defence and slapped the attacker arriving in a black @entity35 at around 8.30am - a good hour and a half before the scheduled kick off - he waved at the assembled bank of press photographers as he entered through a side door of the @entity90 court			1
but outside the main entrance , the two dozen or so protesters who had gathered were not smiling			0
waving banners reading ' troops home ' , ' @entity272 ' and ' @entity223 out ' , they greeted the former prime minister with an angry reception			0
protest : waving banners reading ' troops home ' , ' @entity272 ' and ' @entity223 out ' , about a dozen protesters greeted the former prime minister when he arrived at the hearing angry : shouts of ' traitor ' also came from the small but dogged crowd determined to pursue the ex-premier wherever he turned up furious : outside the main entrance , the two dozen or so protesters who had gathered were not smiling @entity286 , a @entity287 from @entity288 in @entity90 , carried a large knitted puppet of a judge bearing a sign on its chest reading ' @entity1 the day of judgment			2
' the 78 - year - old said : ' i was a 1997 @entity141 person when @entity1 got his majority and i 'm afraid he 's proved a great let - down			1
' we got very few things that he promised			0
the war in @entity223 is the greatest treachery			0
' i 'm glad we could get here today because it 's very difficult to get hold of @entity1			2
' earlier , mr @entity1 cut a relaxed and smiling figure as he strode into the @entity92 for his grilling at the @entity2 anti-war artist @entity305 , 69 , from @entity90 , repeated the familiar argument that the @entity308 's most controversial act in office - had been ' for the oil '			1
he asked : ' why ca n't they just come out and say ( it ? ) ' shouts of ' traitor ' also came from the small but dogged crowd determined to pursue the ex-premier wherever he turned up			0
' truth and justice is the central message ' , mr @entity305 said			0
but ' justice ' for the perceived wrongs of the @entity53 war was not on the bill for yesterday 's hearing about @entity1 's relationship with the media .			1

intruder was filmmaker and veteran @entity15 protester @entity8
he burst in from behind @entity10 through security - coded entrance reserved for the judge alone
police arrest 49 - year - old man over incident
he yells that @entity1 had been ' bought ' by @entity16 in build up to @entity15
lord @entity10 orders investigation into how he got into courtroom
