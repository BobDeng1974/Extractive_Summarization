@entity1 , a senior mp with her country ’s ruling party , said @entity5 immigrants to @entity7 were no longer seeking low - paid work in the agricultural sector as they did a decade ago			1
instead , she said , her countrymen would inevitably seek out middle - class professions			0
speaking at a conference in @entity18 yesterday , miss @entity1 criticised @entity7 politicians who suggest immigration from the @entity21 has prevented @entity7 youths from finding jobs			1
she said @entity7 had been happy to open the labour market when it needed low paid agricultural workers and it was not possible to ‘ eat the cake and still have it ’			1
‘ you mentioned the problem of competition from @entity31 , @entity5 people and that they are not so well paid ; you say that @entity7 people ca n’t get a job because someone else has got it			1
‘ but competition is a part of a free market economy so you ca n’t blame people that are able to compete			0
‘ it ’s not only about the money they get , it ’s also about sometimes education and competing in a different way ... i think it ’s wrong to say they are stealing places to work			0
‘ you have to remember why you opened the labour market , you did it because you needed these people			1
‘ about agriculture , @entity5 and other nations came here because @entity57 did n’t want to do this work anymore and now the @entity5 people are better educated and their knowledge of @entity61 is better so they are looking for other possibilities			2
‘ that ’s why some of the employers in the agriculture sphere are complaining there are no @entity5 who like to work there			2
‘ so we should remember how we started this process of opening the labour market			1

@entity94 described the country 's ' skills deficit ' ‘ immigration of the brightest and the best will always do well and prosper in this country			0
’ she said the education system in @entity7 in the past had not been ‘ outward looking ’ and competitive enough , adding : ‘ i despair on that point i really do			2
' i worked for a range of companies around the world and you can see what the competition is like			0
' and it is extraordinary that we had that lack of focus on training and skills development in this country			0
‘ we have to be brutal and face the facts in this country			0
' we have had generations in this country that have n’t worked , and so that ’s become their social norm and trying to break that culture of worklessness which is one of the largest battle this government has alongside making schools competitive again			0
