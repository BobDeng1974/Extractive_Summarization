the way that @entity1 – one of @entity3 ’s most eligible bachelors – announced his engagement to @entity5 in the @entity7 newspaper has loudly applauded by a public sick of celebrity over-sharing			1
the style is typical of the @entity12 star – unassuming and modest in comparison to his showbiz status , as was his response a question from a reporter about how he felt about breaking thousands of women ’s hearts – that he had made the most important heart happier			0
his charismatic personality is as much of a lure for his legions of followers as his acting prowess – an old school gentleman in a sea of brash modern males			0
the actress had been desperate until recently for her son to settle down and have grandchildren , so was delighted to hear that he had proposed to girlfriend @entity5 ( right )			2
@entity30 is an extremely talented actress who tarred in @entity37 , carry on films and @entity39 he is the result of a comfortable upbringing in a loving family , where his parents are as much in love today as they were 42 years ago , but also as the son of a successful actress who was a household name in the 1970s			1
so who is this woman who inspired both @entity1 ’s career and love life ? his mother @entity52 , 79 , is an extremely talented actress in her own right , with a long list of tv shows and films credits to her name			1
while she was a familiar face on television throughout the 70s and 80s , @entity30 is best for her role as colonel @entity37 in the 1970 ’s sci - fi programme @entity37			1
one reviewer said of her performance in the show : ‘ colonel @entity37 is effortlessly played by the @entity69 beauty @entity52			1
‘ tall , slim and incredibly attractive , she portrayed a cool executive without losing her femininity			0
’ @entity72 and @entity52 in the television series @entity37 in 1973 @entity37 was n’t the only big name show that she featured in , from 1989 to 1992 she had a recurring role in @entity39 as @entity77 ’s mother , in heartbeat as @entity79 and in @entity80 as @entity81 , to name just a few			1
she also appeared in two of the @entity83 in 1964 and @entity84 1968			0
@entity1 has previously spoken of his embarrassment at some of his mother more raunchy roles , including a theatre part that involved her helping a cheating man to get dressed before his girlfriend returned			1
he told @entity7 in 2010 : ‘ i had to say to her , sorry , @entity94 , i just ca n't bear to see that gag one more time			0
‘ i was so sensitive to it , she must have wondered if i was gay			0
" but despite cringing at some of her roles , it was @entity30 and his actor father @entity102 ’s successful careers that convinced him to try for a career in performance art himself			1
actress @entity52 seen at her @entity107 flat in the late 1970s he told @entity108 last year : ‘ what kid would n’t ? have you ever been backstage ? ‘ all the sets , with the name of the production on the back , with weights on the bottom of them , to hold them steady			1
‘ and in the wings , you see all that			0
but then you walk on stage – and you walk into a real world , for the people who are watching it			0
’ @entity30 was an extremely talented actress , with many expecting @entity127 - born woman to become one of @entity3 ’s exports to @entity130			1
but from very early on , her love of a family life battled side - by - side with her desire to perform			2
even in her earliest days of acting she always put her children first – she had to turn down an invitation to join the @entity137 because she was pregnant with her daughter – @entity1 ’s older half - sister			1
@entity1 has since spoken of his regret that @entity30 may have missed some golden opportunities through putting the needs of others above her own			2
he said : ‘ i 'd love her to have a ' @entity144 ' , but for that you have to have a huge backlog of classical roles			0
" ( @entity148 ) @entity149 , @entity52 , @entity1 , @entity150 and @entity151 pose backstage at the hit play " @entity156 " on @entity153 at the @entity154 in @entity155 on may 1 , 2012 this maternal instinct overriding ambition carried on throughout @entity1 ’s childhood – he has spoken previously of her decision to choose commercial television over the @entity137 in order to provide the fees needed for his preparatory school in @entity164 and later his scholarship place at @entity166			1
a scholarship place among @entity3 ’s super-rich has caused many in the public school system to crack , but it was @entity30 and @entity102 ’s complete confidence in their middle - class son also helped him hold his own among the elite at the prestigious boarding school			1
he told @entity176 that he was never bullied there because : ‘ my parents loved the f * * * * * g life out of me , so i felt confident about the world			0
just like … i could step into the world			0
’ one area that they influenced @entity1 against their better judgement though , was in his career choice			2
fully aware of the financial difficulties that came from a life in the arts , his mother tried hard to convince him that he would be more suited to a serious job			2
@entity52 pictured in a scene from the programme @entity195 in 1969 @entity1 had played along and looked into a career in law while studying at @entity166 , before eventually deciding on a degree in @entity199 at @entity200			1
he told @entity176 : ‘ they just saw the pitfalls of it every day			0
you do n’t know where your next job is coming from , and it ’s unstable , and you want stability for your children			0
’ and fortunately for the thousands of @entity208 out there , @entity1 continued to go against his mother ’s advice and forged a glittering career in film , television and theatre			1
but her anti-showbiz stance has stayed with him throughout his ascent to stardom – it is one of the key reasons that he constantly shies away from the limelight and is rarely seen at a celebrity party			0
@entity30 ’s biggest influence on her son though has got to be the example of romance that she and his father @entity102 have set throughout their 38 - year marriage			1
the couple met while in 1972 while filming the tv drama @entity232 together			2
@entity30 was still married to her first husband , the businessman @entity233 , at the time , but the union had been on the rocks for a long time and was all but finished			0
@entity102 and @entity30 had instant chemistry on the television set and have barely been apart since – finally marrying in 1976			2
@entity1 's parents @entity151 and @entity52 in @entity241 in the early 1980s the pair are hopeless romantics and for the first seven years that they were together , @entity102 sent her a single rose every morning			1
she told an interviewer in the late 1970s : ‘ @entity246 is a great romantic , which is really why — in the end — i decided i would remarry			0
’ she got hitched in a pair of jeans held up by braces – much to the embarrassment of her daughter @entity253 , who was by then a teenager			0
her fashion choices have definitely rubbed off on @entity1 though – he has made it very clear before that he has little interest in high - maintenance ladies			1
he told an interviewer back in 2011 : ‘ a woman who knows that she does n't have to get all decked out to look good is sexy			0
@entity30 and @entity102 lived for more than a decade in a three - bedroom flat in @entity107 – until @entity1 was 12 years old			1
@entity52 in @entity261 in 2005 without a garden of their own , @entity30 took him regularly to @entity264 , where he found a love for @entity241 parks – an interest that influenced the positioning of his current home next to @entity270			2
as @entity1 headed into his teens and enrolled at @entity166 , his parents sold up and moved to a three - bedroom cottage in @entity274 that neighbours @entity276 ’s mansion			1
while the couple also own a holiday home in @entity279 , @entity30 mainly spends her time at the @entity281 property , where she tends to the garden and indulges in her hobby of collecting barn owl memorabilia			2
although she claims to be retired , the actress has recently been dipping her toe back in television – most recently with a cameo on @entity289 earlier this year			2
actor @entity1 and @entity5 attend the @entity290 of @entity291 2014 she also starred in an episode of @entity293 where she and her husband played the onscreen parents of @entity1 ’s detective character			2
but her keen interest in her son ’s career has been matched in recent years by her desire for him to settle down and have children			0
so , she would have been delighted to have been informed that her son had asked his girlfriend @entity303 to marry him last month			0
he admitted last week that grandchildren were next on her wish list for her son , saying : ‘ my mother is also waiting for @entity307			0

his mother @entity52 , 79 , is an extremely talented actress
mother - of - two starred in @entity37 , carry on films and only fools and *horses*
her 38 - year marriage to his father @entity102 is also an inspiration
the couple gave @entity1 his drive to succeed in the performing arts
