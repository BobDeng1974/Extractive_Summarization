by @entity1 reporter published : 10:03 est , 27 november 2013 updated : 20:51 est , 27 november 2013 father of four @entity3 laboured long and hard in his own time to try to make his children ’s walk to school safer			1
giving up three weekends , he built a set of steps down a muddy embankment to keep them off a busy road			1
but his good deed failed to impress the health and safety police ... who ruled the creation was a hazard in itself and ordered him to demolish it			0
@entity3 with his wife @entity21 and pupils of @entity24 school on the steps which have now been removed without the steps , the children must scramble down the slippery bank or cross the road at a bend further along the road and walk 100 yards with no pavement to reach the bus stop			1
mr @entity3 went to work without complaint to try to eradicate the danger , taking his nine - year - old son @entity37 with him to help build the steps			1
but two weeks later he received a letter from @entity40 which owns the embankment in @entity42 , @entity43			0
he was told that should anyone fall and hurt themselves while using the steps the association would be liable for any litigation			2
hazard : the children 's route to the bus taking in the muddy embankment , with steps now dismantled @entity40 ordered the father to remove the steps and hand rail as they would be liable for damages if anyone were to injure themselves without the steps , children have to either scramble up and down the slippery bank or walk 100 yards along a busy road with no pavement and cross it on a bend to reach the bus stop mr @entity3 , who also has a seven - year - old son and two daughters aged six and four , has taken the steps down but described the authority ’s reaction as ‘ ridiculous ’ because it has made the children ’s journey to @entity24 primary school more hazardous			1
the 37 - year - old , who owns a vehicle restoration company , said : ‘ i only spent about £ 10 doing it because a lot of the materials i had left over from work			1
‘ it was much safer than what was there before			0
the school bus stops directly opposite the steps , so the children and my wife just have to walk down the steps and cross the road at a straight point			2
’ he said the children now have to slide down the bank or ‘ walk about 100 yards down a road with no pavement , cross the road on a junction and walk back against traffic ’			0
mr @entity3 added : i have reluctantly taken them down now but it is a ridiculous thing to have to do – now they are far more dangerous			0
’ @entity103 , of @entity40 , said : ‘ the steps are on @entity40 ’s land and if anyone were to be injured we may be liable			2
‘ we can not risk this and this is why we asked the residents to remove the steps			0

the 37 - year - old was ordered to remove them by a **housing** association
@entity40 **housing** association said they would be liable for *accidents*
