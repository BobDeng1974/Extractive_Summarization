a @entity1 nuclear power reactor was shut down for five months over fears of a @entity4 - style meltdown			2
one of two reactors at @entity7 power station on the @entity9 coast was closed by energy giant @entity10 last year after concerns that its shingle bank flood defences could be breached during a catastrophic weather event			1
the flood defences were reviewed in an official government report in response to the @entity4 disaster and they were found to ‘ not be as robust as previously thought ’			1
worries : one of two reactors at @entity7 power station on the @entity9 coast was closed by energy giant @entity10 after concerns that its shingle bank flood defences could be breached during a catastrophic weather event in 2011 , an earthquake struck @entity23 , killing 20,000 people and resulting in a tsunami to crash over the @entity4 nuclear plant ’s sea wall			1
@entity10 told the @entity28 ( @entity28 ) in december 2012 that it ‘ no longer has confidence ’ in its sea defences being able to defend against rare weather events such as the @entity23 tsunami			1
one of the reactors at the power station , which generates enough power for about 750,000 homes , was shut down on may 22 in order to build a new barrier wall			1
it was reopened again in october			2
the new permanent wall around the site is expected to be finished by the end of the month			2
the defences were upgraded from protecting against a one - in - 1,000 year weather event to one that occurs every 10,000 years			1
damage : in 2011 , an earthquake struck @entity23 , killing 20,000 people and resulting in a tsunami to crash over the @entity4 nuclear plant 's sea wall billowing : smoke is seen coming from the area of the no. 3 reactor of the @entity4 plant in march 2011 an @entity10 spokesman said last night : ‘ @entity10 chose to take the reactor offline to further improve flooding defence at @entity7 the @entity7 nuclear station started generating power in 1965 , before it was joined by @entity7 two decades later			1
@entity7 is formed of two advanced gas cooled reactors which began operations in 1983 and 1985			1
they were set up more than a decade behind schedule and at four times the cost estimated to get them running			2
@entity7 remains operational after the 2006 closure of @entity7 , which was the world 's oldest operating nuclear power station at the time			1
the site is protected from storm surges and coastal erosion by shingle extracted locally			1
a @entity74 was considered in 2009 on a list of 11 potential sites for new nuclear power stations - but the government later ruled it out , citing environmental reasons			2
' prior to this the site was deemed safe to operate and protected from events which would occur one in every 1,000 years by the nuclear safety regulator , the @entity28			0
‘ we conservatively took the decision to take both reactors offline in order to undertake additional protection to cover extremely rare events ; ones which might happen only one in 10,000 years			1
‘ part of this work included building a flood defence wall around the site which is due to be completed this month			1
' we are continuously updating and improving the plant to ensure it is operating safely			0
the recent weather has had no impact on operations at @entity7 ’ @entity101 , station director at @entity7 , said : ‘ the recent adverse weather has had no impact on existing infrastructure and the power station has operated normally in the recent high tides and stormy weather			1
’ an @entity28 spokesman said : ‘ we consider @entity109 to be making satisfactory progress in improving the @entity7 flood defences , taking into account the challenges associated with the work and the need to ensure high confidence in the completed defences			1
’ @entity118 ( @entity119 ) : september 1957 thousands of people are exposed to radiation and thousands more evacuated from their houses after a chemical explosion near @entity124 sees up to 80 tonnes of radioactive materials released into the air			0
@entity127 ( @entity128 ) : october 1957 a limited release of radioactivity caused by a fire in the graphite - core reactor sees the sale of milk from local farms banned for a month			0
the reactor at @entity127 ( right ) is buried in concrete after it can not be salvaged			0
@entity138 ( @entity119 ) : april 1986 an experiment causes one of four reactors to explode , with the resulting fire burning for nine days			2
the explosion kills two people and 28 more die from acute radiation sickness directly after the blast			0
it is also thought that the disaster caused thousands of cancer deaths			0
@entity151 ( @entity23 ) : march 2011 a magnitude - 9.0 earthquake at sea causes a tsunami to damage four of six reactors at the nuclear power plant site			2
fires are set off after cooling systems fail , but there is only a minimal risk to health			0
and here are three nuclear near - misses : @entity164 ( @entity165 ) : may 1957 a cow was killed and residents of @entity168 terrified when a b - 36 aircraft transporting a nuclear bomb from @entity171 to @entity165 fell through the bomb bay doors from 1,700 feet and detonated , blasting a crater 12ft deep and 25ft across			0
luckily the nuclear capsule had separated from the bomb and did not explode			0
@entity176 ( @entity177 ) : february 1958 a @entity178 carrying a nuclear bomb collided mid-air with an f - 86 jet during a training flight			0
the device was jettisoned and fell into the river and has never been located			0
@entity185 ( @entity186 ) : march 1961 a crippled @entity187 carrying a pair of nuclear bombs suffered a loss of pressure at 10,000ft			0
the commander stayed aboard to pilot the plane away from @entity185 before ejecting at 4,000ft			0
the plane crashed but nothing detonated and the bombs were recovered .			0

one of two reactors at @entity7 in @entity9 closed by company last year
@entity10 was worried that its shingle bank flood defences could be breached
