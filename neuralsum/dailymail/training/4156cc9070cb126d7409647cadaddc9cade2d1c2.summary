it was a case of life emulating art for @entity4 actress @entity3 , when she stripped off for a charity calendar - a decade after starring in smash hit film @entity8			1
the award winning film told the true story of a group of @entity15 members who posed naked to raise funds for @entity17			1
now ms @entity3 , who played @entity18 in the film , has posed naked for a real charity calendar which was put together to support a dog rescue charity			1
@entity3 braved a naked calendar shoot for the month of october again - with her pet dog @entity24 the 64 - year - old bravely agreed to undress after adopting her own pet pooch from @entity27			1
it is the first time ms @entity3 has stripped for charity - despite the success of @entity8 sparking a craze for nude calendars in support of good causes			1
nevertheless , ms @entity3 said her experience of playing @entity18 did help during the shoot , which saw her strike a pose alongside her dog , @entity24			1
ms @entity3 adopted her 12 - year - old @entity42 cross after he was found injured and starving to death in a sewage pipe in @entity45 by @entity27			1
the 2015 charity calendar in which @entity47 is featured - her second time posing nude ' appearing in @entity48 was i thought the first and last time i would pose naked for a calendar but it appears not , ' explained ms @entity3			2
' i 'm quite a bit older now than i was when we filmed @entity8 so you could say it was a brave move but i was more than happy to help such a fantastic charity			0
' in fact on the day of the shoot i was probably the least nervous because of my past experience in the film and i was able to reassure the other women who either work for the charity or have adopted dogs , who were understandably a bit anxious			2
' but of course we all had our dogs there with us and they were the real stars of the show			0
you would think getting 12 @entity45 street dogs to pose might be tricky but they were wonderful and it just goes to show what beautiful animals they are			2
' @entity3 's original pose for the month of october in the 2003 film @entity8 @entity3 thought the film would be the first and last time she would pose naked for a calendar the charity ms @entity3 posed for helps injured and abandoned dogs from the @entity4 and @entity45 and recently hit the headlines after raising Â£ 3000 for a set of bionic paws for a dog that had undergone a double amputation in @entity45			1
the actress adopted her dog dust 18 months ago , and finally realised her life long ambition of becoming a dog owner			1
' i have always loved dogs and always wanted a dog but as an actress it can be tricky to juggle time and commitments , ' she added			2
' but i decided i just could n't wait a minute longer and looked into re- homing an older animal because they are always the hardest to home			0
' she had read about @entity24 on the @entity105 website and says she knew instantly he was the one for her			0
' when i read what @entity24 had been through , i just felt strongly he was the one so i phoned @entity105 and asked if i could come and meet him			0
' i went that day and fell in love with @entity24 straight away but of course the charity wanted to give me the once over before they agreed i could take him			0
' since the adoption @entity114 has become a firm supporter of @entity117 - but admits she had to think twice when she was asked to strip naked again			0
' who would n't at my age ? ' , she admitted			0
' but in all honesty i actually felt very relaxed on the day and we all had a good giggle			0
' an out - take from @entity3 's calendar shoot with her pet dog dust actress @entity3 pictured with her pet dog @entity24 , rescued from charity safe rescue for dogs @entity128 , who set up the charity and came up with the idea , said : ' we are always looking for new fundraising ideas and a calendar had been on the horizon for some time but it was n't until we started planning it that i remember that we had an original @entity137 in our midst			1
' i knew it was very cheeky to ask @entity3 if she might strip naked and be in our calendar but if you do n't ask you do n't get and to my utter delight she agreed			2
' the images were shot on a chilly morning at a farm near @entity145 last month			0
' i think anyone passing might have got a shock if they looked over to see the actress @entity3 naked in a field with her dog , ' added miss @entity3			1
' she is a real superstar because not only is she a great actress , but a warm and kind human being who wants to help others			0
we ca n't thank her enough for her support			0
' but of course the real stars of the show are the dogs who have survived injury , attack and sickness to find new loving homes in the @entity4			2
