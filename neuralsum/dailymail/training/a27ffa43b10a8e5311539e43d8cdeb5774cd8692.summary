this is the dramatic moment a self - styled ' paedophile hunter ' snared a pervert in an internet sting by posing as a 13 - year - old girl			1
disgraced former solicitor @entity5 , 51 , was arrested after attempting to meet up with the youngster he sexually groomed online			1
a court heard @entity5 drove 54 miles to see who he thought was a teenager called ' @entity11 ' after striking up a relationship over social media			1
when @entity5 arrived at the house in @entity27 , @entity28 , the paedophile did not find the girl but was instead greeted by mr @entity20 and his recording crew			1
they filmed the moment @entity5 arrived at the house expecting to meet the 13 - year - old , before being confronted by mr @entity20			1
in a three minute 34 second video of the encounter , @entity5 can be seen confirming he messaged the girl but claiming he was trying to help her			1
mr @entity20 reads out messages the paedophile had sent including one that said : ' if we had a cuddle and you aroused me that could cause a bit of a problem			1
' @entity5 also wrote to what he thought was the teenage girl : ' you might get a bit aroused yourself and i 'm not very good with temptation			2
' in front of the cameras , @entity5 accepted he had been ' inappropriate ' but claimed he was just being ' cheeky with her '			2
in the video , @entity5 , who now works as a bookmaker , is then told that the police had been informed , and he is seen getting into his car and driving away			2
@entity60 heard that @entity5 was struck off as a solicitor after he forged a client 's will @entity5 , from @entity64 , @entity65 , denied a charge of attempting to meet a child after sexual grooming and claimed he was trapped into going to @entity27			1
during the trial he had claimed he only went to visit the girl to ' boost her confidence '			2
but a jury took just one hour of deliberating to find @entity5 guilty at @entity60			1
recorder @entity73 adjourned sentence for reports until march 26 , and warned @entity5 that he could face a prison term			1
following the verdict the jury heard that @entity5 had previously worked as a solicitor but was struck off in 2002 after he was jailed for fraud having obtained almost £ 50,000 by forging a client 's will			2
in court , the bookmaker said he had agreed to the girl 's request and had planned to tell her he could n't spare any more of his time			2

' ' i then arrested him and he clarified " is this about the ill - advised trip to @entity27 ? " ' one of mr @entity20 's team , who posed on the internet as ' @entity11 ' , had used a photo of a 21 - year - old woman for the teenager 's picture on the @entity107 dating and friendship social network site			1
@entity5 also used the site , and in his first message to ' @entity11 ' he said that she was a ' very pretty girl ' and asked if she had time for older guys			2
he also wrote : ' ever fancy some older c * * * ? ' the reply included the mention that ' @entity11 ' was only 13 , but the internet messages and text messages continued			0
