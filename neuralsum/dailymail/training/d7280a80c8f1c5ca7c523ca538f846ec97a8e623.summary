by @entity0 and @entity1 the staggering scale of abuse of the student visa system by immigrants desperate to stay in @entity6 was revealed yesterday			1
tens of thousands of bogus students faked @entity11 language tests to beat @entity6 border controls , the government admitted			1
an estimated 48,000 immigrants had exploited the lax system in a ‘ shocking ’ scam run by criminal gangs , said immigration minister @entity17			1
immigration minister @entity17 said @entity11 language tests were being cheated to allow foreign students to stay in @entity6 he revealed there had been ‘ systematic cheating ’ that allowed foreigners who could barely speak a word of @entity11 to stay in the country illegally , with corrupt invigilators reading out answers or allowing gangs of imposters to sit tests so the candidates could be awarded an @entity11 language certificate			1
the @entity31 has been called in to assist the investigation and some arrests have already been made			0
it is the latest immigration scandal to rock the @entity35			0
last month the @entity36 revealed migrants who can not speak @entity11 were able to buy a certificate saying they had passed a language test			0
the document opens the door to @entity6 citizenship , allowing them access to a full range of benefits			1
our investigation exposed @entity48 , which ran the scam at exam centres licensed by the @entity35			2
during our undercover probe , the @entity36 paid £ 500 for a pass certificate in the @entity11 language exam for a fake candidate despite him never sitting the test or taking a course			1
speaking in the @entity57 yesterday , mr @entity17 said immigration officials were working with @entity59 to identify foreign students who are in @entity6 unlawfully as a result of taking the fake language tests , so they can be booted out			1
he revealed there had been ' systematic cheating ' that allowed foreigners who could barely speak a word of @entity11 to stay in the country illegally in one extraordinary case , an overseas university student earned more than £ 20,000 a year despite rules preventing them from working more than 20 hours a week during term time			1
ministers also said there were ‘ serious concerns ’ surrounding the colleges and universities which had allowed the overseas students to enrol on courses			2
the @entity35 was alerted to the student visa scandal only after it was exposed by a @entity81 programme in february			0
@entity82 , the major company that sets the exams but does not appoint the invigilators , is now at the centre of a police probe			2
in a humiliating commons appearance , mr @entity17 said an investigation had found more than 29,000 falsified test certificates and another 19,000 questionable results			1
but he was forced to admit : ‘ it is likely that the true totals will be higher			0
’ he added : ‘ evidently this could only happen with considerable collusion by the test centres concerned			0
the government is not prepared to tolerate this abuse			0
‘ we will not hesitate to take firm action against those students , colleges and universities who do not abide by their legal responsibilities , and bring those responsible to justice			2
’ each year , around 100,000 non-eu students get their visas to stay in the @entity6 extended			1
since 2011 foreign students have had to prove they can speak @entity11			1
@entity109 in north - east @entity110 , has been stripped of its right to admit foreign students after up to 350 were identified as having invalid or dubious test results			1
in addition , 57 private further education colleges also had licenses for admitting foreign students suspended			1
the @entity116 and @entity117 are no longer allowed to recruit overseas students pending inquiries			2
mr @entity17 said the ‘ worst abuse ’ took place at the campuses of @entity123 universities which were located in other parts of the country			1
he has ordered a separate inquiry by the @entity128 , a university watchdog			0
in 2012 , academics expressed concerns that universities were recruiting foreign students whose grasp of @entity11 is so poor they would ‘ struggle to scrape a gcse ’			1
foreign students were seen as ‘ cash cows ’ as they could be charged up to £ 20,000 in fees			1
@entity139 immigration minister @entity138 said the scale of the scandal was ‘ truly shocking ’			0
he added : ‘ people will be outraged that genuine students who can add to our economy are being turned away while bogus students prosper under this government			2
it is clearly an abuse that damages the integrity of the system			2
’ the @entity153 said @entity154 had done nothing to tighten up immigration controls during its time in power and it had ‘ fallen on this government to introduce further stringent measures ’			0
ministers have no idea how many sham marriages are conducted in @entity6 , the government 's borders chief told @entity165 today			1
sir @entity166 , the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration , said there were likely to be many more fake weddings than the 10,000 estimated by the @entity35			0
he told the @entity171 that the problem was ' much more widespread ' than ministers admitted			0
former chief constable sir @entity166 told mps the @entity35 did not know how many people were abusing the immigration system by carrying out sham marriages sir @entity166 said @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 were most likely to be caught trying to cheat their way past border controls by conducting a fake wedding			2
but he added : ' one of the fundamental problems is that the @entity35 does n't really know			0
' there 's a combination of a lack of intelligence and also of poor management information in order for the @entity35 to get a grip on it			0
' he was asked whether he thought there were many more sham marriages than officially recorded			0
sir @entity166 said : ' i think so			0
' he added : ' it is a much more widespread issue than the figures suggest			0
' he said some couples turned up for their ceremony in casual clothes and stood texting on their mobile phones throughout the service .			0
