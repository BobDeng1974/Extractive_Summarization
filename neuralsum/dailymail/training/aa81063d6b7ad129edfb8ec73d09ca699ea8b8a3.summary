by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:22 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 16 september 2013 @entity2 was dismissed as ' ridiculous ' today as he caved in to pressure from @entity4 to back the @entity6 leader in a crunch vote on the economy			1
the business secretary had vowed to stay away from the showdown at the party conference in @entity12 , in a move seen as a challenge to mr @entity4 ’s authority			1
publicly mr @entity4 played down talk of a rift , but privately his allies were furious at what they saw as botched attempt by mr cable to woo left - wing @entity6 unhappy with the austerity programme			2
left - wing @entity6 wanted to commit the party to watering down the government 's deficit - reduction programme and changing the mandate of the @entity43 to encourage growth and job creation			2
mr @entity2 - who had not been planning to vote - made an 11th - hour change of heart and turned up in the conference hall to cast his vote in support of mr @entity4			1
an ally of the @entity6 leader said : ' @entity2 now just looks f * * * * * * ridiculous			1
the self - indulgent act of subordination can only be done so many times			0
' appeal : in an unusual move mr @entity4 spoke in the debate to persuade members to back his economic policy @entity6 chief whip @entity59 today admitted he is ' fine ' with the idea of @entity4 being deeply unpopular			1
almost three - quarters of people identifying themselves as @entity6 voters in a survey by @entity64 for @entity65 said mr @entity4 was not a good leader			2
more than half said he should stand down before the 2015 election			0
but mr @entity59 said : ' there are going to be people who do n’t like us because they are conservatives and they want the government to be more conservative or because they ’re @entity73 supporters and they want it to go in the opposite direction			0
' the fact of the matter is that @entity6 in government every day are making a real difference			2
and if that makes @entity4 unpopular with conservatives and @entity73 voters , then frankly that ’s alright by me			0
' it was seen as an embarrassing about - face which will have damaged mr @entity2 's leadership ambitions			1
the row dates from when the economic motion was agreed at an away day where @entity90 backed mr @entity4 's tough line			1
today mr @entity2 sat in the middle of the conference hall as mr @entity4 gave an impassioned speech urging members to back his policy			1
he warned delegates that victory for the amendments would be welcomed only by chancellor @entity101 and his @entity73 shadow @entity102			0
mr @entity4 said : ' please be careful for what you wish for			0
if we start messing about with the big goalposts we have stuck in the ground which frame the stability which is required for further economic growth , we will destroy jobs and decrease prosperity			0
' mr @entity2 last night signalled that he would not back a motion supporting the @entity115 ’s deficit reduction plans			1
mr @entity2 issued a statement saying there were ‘ aspects ’ of the motion he could not support			1
this was seen as a clear signal that he wants the government to increase borrowing			0
it was seen as a direct challenge to mr @entity4 , who has made a bold pitch that the economic recovery would not be happening without @entity6 in government			2
‘ loyalty is n’t really @entity2 ’s thing , ’ said a senior party source			1
this morning mr @entity4 said : ‘ i do n't run a boot camp , i do n't determine exactly who is in which room at what time			2
’ @entity138 minister @entity137 also took a thinly - veiled swipe at mr @entity2 ’s tendency to try to appear ‘ bashful ’ about being part of the coalition			1
policy : the economic policy has been written by mr @entity4 and treasury minister @entity145 speaking at a @entity147 fringe event , mr @entity137 did not mention mr @entity2 by name			1
but he warned : ‘ the task for us as a party is to ask ourselves are we proud of our government or are we ashamed of it ? we need to sell the purpose of the government rather than feeling bashful about it			0
‘ we should n’t equivocate when it comes to the role we have played in the gradual national recovery			0
‘ if we do n’t associate ourselves with those achievements , we do n’t deserve to be associated with the recovery by anybody else			0
' senior @entity6 source in a highly unusual move , mr @entity4 took to the platform himself to urge his party to stick to the spending plans agreed with the @entity168			2
he saw off the challenge from left - wing activists who tabled a rebel amendment which called for borrowing restrictions on councils to be lifted , allowing town hall chiefs to run up deficits to pay for new housing			0
@entity6 president @entity177 , another potential leadership challenger seen as a standard - bearer for the left , gave his fulsome support to mr @entity4			1
warning against handing over credit for the recovery to @entity101 , mr @entity177 told the conference : ' what an irony : just as the economy was growing , just as our 2010 decisions were being vindicated , just as our fortunes were turning , we got the jitters and handed the credit to @entity101			0
' what an irony if just at the moment that even as @entity102 is n't sure that he agrees with @entity102 ... we might agree with @entity102			0
' he urged his party to have the courage to vote in favour of the motion .			0

business secretary suggested he would not back @entity115 ' economic plan
@entity2 said there were ‘ aspects ’ of conference motion he could not support
furious @entity6 leadership rage : ' loyalty is n't really @entity2 's thing '
after pressure @entity2 agreed to vote against call for more borrowing
