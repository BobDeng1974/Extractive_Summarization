this was as far away from the @entity2 cauldron as it is possible to be but a quiet day of run scoring against sub-standard opposition in picturesque @entity6 at the start of @entity10 ’s @entity9 tour meant everything to @entity12			1
it must have seemed to @entity12 that he would never again bat for @entity10 when he suffered that brutal dismantling at the hands of @entity17 during @entity10 ’s ill - fated last @entity2 tour almost 18 months ago			1
yet here he was , recovered from the mental condition that forced his departure from @entity21 and now certain of a new role opening the batting in the first test in @entity25 next week			0
it is quite a comeback			0
@entity12 and @entity27 combine impressively as @entity10 produce dominant display @entity27 plays behind square as wicketkeeper @entity30 looks on in @entity6 , @entity31 if @entity12 ’s return with 72 was the most pleasing aspect of a dominant day for @entity10 then an unbeaten 95 for captain @entity27 was almost as important			1
the pair came together here at the top of the order yesterday for the first time since a brief experiment in @entity40 five years ago in what was a low - key return to work after the embarrassment of @entity10 ’s first round @entity45 exit			1
neither @entity27 nor @entity12 could be blamed for that nor for the careful way they went about their batting in this two - day practice match against a @entity52 that would struggle to defeat a decent @entity54 club side			2
@entity55 bowls in the @entity9 sun as @entity10 take on a @entity31 and @entity57 @entity27 and teammate @entity12 talk in between overs during the @entity31 and @entity57 game such was the scale of @entity10 ’s @entity45 embarrassment that they find themselves very much on trial again now even though they ended last year ’s @entity24 summer with three successive wins against @entity64			1
the failure of @entity66 to convince alongside @entity27 has opened the door for the return of @entity12 ahead of @entity69 and he made the most of his chance in a stand of 158 with his captain made in the most comfortable of circumstances			1
@entity10 had barely broken sweat in bowling @entity31 out for 59 , another returnee in @entity77 taking three wickets in five balls , before @entity27 and @entity12 overwhelmed a local side who had bizarrely warmed up in @entity83 shirts			1
perhaps they are better at football than cricket because there was little to concern two players with much to prove for different reasons in @entity27 and @entity12			2
the captain is back after being demoted from one - day office and looked the more fluent , despatching anything short and moving on to his 50 off 95 balls to follow the three half - centuries he has scored in his last four test innings			0
@entity12 was the only casualty of the day for @entity10 and he had to be almost dragged from the crease when he was eventually caught at short leg			2
‘ it ’s almost like he ’s never been away , ’ said @entity77			0
‘ it was really good to see the way he just settled back to how he has been over the last few years			0
’ quite how much the @entity10 attack got out of their morning work - out was questionable because this was a shockingly indisciplined batting display from a @entity31 side who included just seven players with first - class experience			0
@entity110 and @entity55 eased their way back after their own humbling @entity113 but the most penetrative bowling came from @entity77 , who swung the ball consistently on a typically slow and flat @entity118 pitch			0
@entity10 batsmen @entity27 plays to the leg side during the @entity121 match against @entity31 and @entity122 @entity12 plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the @entity31 and @entity10 tour match @entity10 plan to use @entity77 , who was left out of the @entity45 after a dreadful run , as their all - rounder in this series , batting at six at least until the return of @entity130 which they hope will come ahead of the second test			1
@entity77 and @entity134 are clearly ahead of @entity135 and the newcomer @entity136 in the pecking order while @entity138 and @entity139 appear to be competing for the solitary spinner ’s place next week			0
both took a wicket towards the end of the @entity31 innings while @entity139 added a spectacular one - handed slip catch			0
@entity27 plays to the offside as wicketkeeper @entity30 of @entity31 and @entity57 looks on @entity27 plays to mid off as wicketkeeper @entity30 looks on during the @entity10 tour match			2

@entity12 hit an impressive 72 on @entity10 return in the @entity9
@entity10 captain @entity27 hit an unbeaten 95 on a dominant day
@entity154 played at top order for first time since brief experiment five years ago
@entity10 barely broke sweat as they bowled a @entity160 all out for 59
