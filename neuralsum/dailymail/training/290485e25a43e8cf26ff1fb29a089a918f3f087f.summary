by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity4 ’s military was warned about the abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls by @entity8 militants but failed to act , it was claimed last night			1
human rights group @entity9 said it had reports from credible sources insisting that security forces knew about the planned raid four hours before it took place			0
the news came as intelligence emerged suggesting the kidnappers , from @entity19 - linked group @entity18 , have split the schoolgirls into at least four groups in an attempt to make rescue ‘ virtually impossible ’			0
@entity58 officials have expressed frustration that it took nearly three weeks for the @entity4 authorities to accept help - days which allowed the @entity18 gunmen and their terrified hostages to scatter and escape into a vast dense forest amid reports some have already crossed the border into neighbouring countries			2
mr @entity40 stressed that his decision to send a small group of @entity44 experts to offer advice and logistical support - joining @entity51 officers in the capital @entity73 - came in response to a request from @entity4 president @entity49			1
@entity44 , the @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 have all now offered assistance , and former prime minister @entity79 has confirmed that air and satellite surveillance is to be extended to neighbouring countries @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 amid fears that the 276 girls kidnapped from a school in the village of @entity38 in northern @entity4 three weeks ago may be trafficked across the border to be sold as slaves			1
a specialist team from @entity93 and another from the @entity75 arrived in @entity4 yesterday to help co-ordinate the hunt and any rescue operation with @entity51 on standby to support and provide expertise for @entity4 - led raids			1
@entity99 ' electronic teams ' deployed with @entity4 officers are to attempt to intercept any voice communication across a huge area of jungle			2
they will use sophisticated jamming equipment called to listen and intercept anything that ' moves or speaks ' and collate signals intelligence			0
following requests from @entity99 officers deployed to @entity4 , @entity44 ministers are said to be reviewing the potential of deploying a @entity114 surveillance aircraft , which would operate out of the @entity77 military base at @entity116 in @entity84			1
the brazenness of the kidnap has shocked @entity4 , who have been growing accustomed to hearing about atrocities in the five - year - old @entity26 insurgency in the north spy plane : following requests from @entity99 officers deployed to @entity4 , @entity44 ministers are said to be reviewing the potential of deploying a @entity114 surveillance aircraft , which would operate out of the @entity77 military base at @entity116 in @entity84 @entity114 ' radar ' plane operated by the @entity129 's @entity128 at @entity130 could be deployed within days , but defence ministers are waiting to see if the @entity75 are going to provide additional aerial surveillance			1
the @entity44 officers have highlighted that the @entity4 needs to isolate the extremists , if possible , in order to make sure they can not strike at more targets before any rescue is mounted			1
asked about suggestions in @entity4 that the offer of international help was patronising , mr @entity40 said : ' we want to work with them and to help , but we are certainly not patronising the @entity4 government			1
' this is an extremely difficult situation			0
these girls have been kidnapped and taken into a jungle area three times the size of @entity149			2
it is an incredibly difficult thing grappling with these extremist @entity26 groups that are prepared to go to any lengths and do appalling things			0
' that is why we have a long - standing arrangement with the @entity4 government and we have police advisers and military advisers who work with them long before this crisis started			2
we offered help right after the abduction was made and we are now stepping up what we are doing , but all the time working with and asking the @entity4 government what they want			1
a map showing the recent @entity18 attacks in @entity4 over the past month ' i spoke directly with the president myself and made an offer which he accepted			1
but i would n't want to go beyond what it is they want us to do			0
' mr @entity79 , who is the @entity173 special envoy on global education , said that he had spoken to @entity75 secretary of state @entity175 , who agreed that air and satellite surveillance would be extended into neighbouring countries			1
the former @entity180 urged @entity44 people to sign the @entity183 petition , which he said was putting pressure on the @entity4 government to take action and making clear that the international community shared the ' revulsion ' of ordinary @entity4 for @entity18			1
@entity75 first lady @entity188 is among dozens of political figures and celebrities , including @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , schoolgirl @entity195 and model @entity196 to have backed the petition			2
the school in @entity38 in @entity4 , where nearly 300 schoolgirls were abducted by @entity18 speaking from @entity4 capital @entity73 , mr @entity79 said : ' the more people who can sign the petition the more i think the @entity4 government officials and others will want to take action			2
' he said : ' the first thing is to locate the girls			2
it is every parent 's nightmare that your daughter or son could be kidnapped and you never see them again , and particularly so as the danger is that they are being trafficked into other countries as sex slaves			0
' i have been working with the @entity44 and @entity75 governments and now @entity76 and @entity77 to get the resources for surveillance for locating these girls - satellite and also air coverage			1
' i hope we can have a special push over the next few days to see if we can find the girls			0
but we have also got to make the schools safe for other girls and boys who are afraid of the terrorists			0
" asked whether the authorities in @entity73 were doing enough to find the girls , mr @entity79 said : ' i do n't think you can have any doubt now about the urgency with which this is being addressed			0
i have been pressing for action for three weeks			0
we have got a combination of international resources and we have got a government which is prepared now to take action about the schools in the country			0
' we are going to have an action plan within the next few days			0
but of course the first thing is to see can we get these girls , who have been so sadly removed from their homes , can we get them back ? that 's where the energy is in the next few days			0

comes as @entity44 and @entity75 send aerial surveillance to help in hunt for girls
@entity40 denies ' patronising ' @entity4 by sending experts to help
he insists move is response to request from @entity4 president @entity49
@entity44 , the @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 have all now offered assistance
