by @entity0 @entity2 movie star @entity1 was in town for the red carpet premiere of his latest installment of the explosive blockbuster franchise @entity7 the first half decent red - carpet event in the capital for a few weeks and my agent got me a couple of tickets and told me i should show my face			1
a gang of us met up at the @entity18 bar just around the corner from the @entity20 – @entity0 , @entity21 , @entity22 and her sister @entity23			1
@entity22 wore a gold @entity34 dress , @entity37 an acid yellow @entity36 gown and both were wearing beautiful jewellery by designer @entity40			2
@entity22 rocked a diamond circle pendant and @entity23 wore a diamond and ruby pendant in 18k white gold with matching earrings			0
when we were on the red - carpet i bumped into top chat show host @entity49			1
i felt i had to apologize for my slightly boorish attitude when on his show last – i had referred to him as @entity55 , which was more than a tad presumptuous given our relative positions in the tv pecking order – but he said he had thought it was funny and that i was welcome to come on his show any time			2
we made our way up the red carpet passing @entity63 and @entity64 along the way and @entity1 was on the balcony waving to the crowd			0
@entity0 caught up with chat show host @entity49 and apologised for his behavior at his last interview dazzling dresses : @entity23 ( left ) wore an acid yellow gown from @entity36 and @entity22 wore a sequin mini-dress from @entity34 the film itself is a high - octane 120 minutes of explosions and gunfire punctuated with some classic one - liners from the stellar cast			1
its saving grace is that it never takes itself too seriously and @entity63 even finds himself able to poke fun at his recent incarceration for tax evasion			0
two highly enjoyable hours later and we made our way over to the after - party at @entity92 nightclub – and to the biggest collection of models you will see this side of @entity96			0
a dozen stunning six foot plus @entity98 in body - con dresses and killer heels were at the back of the club on the owner ’s table			2
getting friendly ? @entity0 hung out with model @entity105 at the premier 's after party i went over to say hello and here i am pictured with @entity109 , who has just shot a big lingerie campaign – so you will soon be seeing her scantily - clad body on 20 - foot high posters all over the @entity114			1
she was slightly taller than me with heels on but it did n’t bother me			0
we left at around midnight and there were still huge queues of fans outside the venue - clearly to see the film stars leave , not me			0
my birthday was this week and i celebrated it with family and friends – and a hair - cut called the @entity128			1
i felt the need for a change and it ’s pretty brutal short back and sides and long quiff on top			2
mine was skillfully performed by hair - stylist @entity137 at @entity139 salon			0
old pals : @entity0 received a big birthday kiss from his ex co-star @entity0 new look : @entity0 describes his new haircut as the @entity128 i ’m 26 now and i ’m told that is the age when you truly become a man			1
let ’s see if this new - found wisdom takes effect now			0
i dined with my family at @entity153 restaurant in @entity154 and then moved on to the @entity155 across the road for drinks with friends			0
i received a birthday kiss from good friend @entity0 and congratulations from the rather gorgeous @entity161			1
i wish it had been the other way round			0
made in @entity164 starts this sunday at 9pm on @entity165 and the whole cast watched the first episode at a screening			0
worthy cause : ( left to right ) @entity170 , @entity0 , @entity171 and @entity172 promote the @entity173 that will run from 10th - 14th september the @entity0 cast pose in @entity173 t - shirt - an event that supports war veterans and the @entity178 ( back row from @entity180 ) @entity22 , @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 ( @entity181 's sister ) @entity184 and @entity183 ( front row as before ) loads more new love interests , rows , intrigue and slightly awkward silences all set within the backdrop of one of the world ’s most amazing cities			1
after the screening i got everyone to put on an @entity173 t shirt – this incredible event at the @entity199 in @entity200 , @entity201 from the 10th to 14th of sept will have injured servicemen and women from 14 nations taking part in sporting competition			1
the event , is being championed by @entity208 and is going to be an amazing spectacle showing our inspirational @entity178 personnel and veterans who put their lives on the line for our country			0
you can buy tickets for the @entity173 at invictusgames.org it ’s only £ 12.85 per person so it ’s a total bargain			1
lots of love , @entity0 .			2
