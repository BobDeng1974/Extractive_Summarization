they claim she is getting even less care than she was before			0

a report , written in april this year by one of the hospital 's staff states how doctors took @entity2 off many of the medications she was taking at the time she was admitted			1
' due to concerns regarding @entity2 ’s regressive behavior changes around her family , the multiple medical procedures and care episodes she has been through … and both parents ’ resistance towards recommended treatment plans for @entity2 … a child protection team was convened , ' it read			1
@entity2 was locked in a psychiatric ward , taken off the medication she had been taking and only allowed to see her family once a week			1

health aside , she is a mess			0
' she ’s in a wheelchair yet she is getting no help with showering or grooming			0
