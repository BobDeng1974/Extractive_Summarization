@entity0 came for the @entity1 yesterday and sent out an ominous warning to the rest of the @entity4 — the big cats from the east @entity6 are in the title hunt again			1
@entity8 had braced themselves for a ‘ backlash ’ after inflicting a record 45 - 0 humiliation on @entity1 in september , but being prepared did n’t save them			1
at a full and freezing @entity13 , this was a hot and spicy encounter , with countless off - the - ball scuffles as the fired - up home side pounded their way to the result they craved			1
@entity1 @entity19 ( left ) celebrates an early try at @entity13 from @entity21 @entity21 powers upfield for the @entity1 during the 17 - 8 victory over @entity8 on sunday afternoon @entity8 — who had @entity26 hopeful @entity25 playing at centre for a full 80 minutes — made a sustained response in the final quarter and should have secured at least a losing bonus point , but they were repelled by the @entity1 ’ defence			1
a last - minute try by @entity33 gave @entity26 fly - half @entity34 a conversion which would have sent the visitors home with some consolation for their efforts , but he dragged his shot wide			2
soon after being annihilated at @entity42 four months ago , @entity1 slumped to ninth place in the table , amid a forensic inquest into the cause of the injury epidemic which was undermining their season			1
but gradually the cavalry have been returning and @entity51 , the @entity1 ’ director of rugby , declared this result will serve as a statement to the rest of the league			1
@entity25 , tackled by @entity56 , made his first @entity4 start for @entity8 at @entity13 ‘ it sends a bullet across the bows of everybody that we ’re still in the mix and we still have the appetite to compete , ’ he said			1
‘ it proves that we can beat the sides who have been on really good form , as clearly @entity8 have been			2
it puts us right back in the mix. ‘ if we can win that game , with the quality that we ’ve still got to come back into the side , it bodes well			2
in isolation it is a massive win for us			0
it ’s only round 12 so there ’s a long way to go but it ’s certainly a building block for us			0
i ’m relieved because we ’ve put ourselves into a position to compete for the title			0
’ @entity19 outjumps @entity81 high in the air during the home side 's 17 - 8 win against @entity8 on sunday @entity51 attempted to play down the vengeance theme , adding : ‘ we did n’t talk about that ( 45 - 0 defeat in the reverse fixture )			1
we did n’t really want to re-visit it too much because every time we watched it , they looked so good ! ‘ i think it was in the back of the players ’ minds but we focused on ourselves and on what we can do well			0
we wanted it more than they did			0
we defended exceptionally well and did n’t allow their back - line to create the opportunities they usually get			0
‘ @entity8 are a very physical team			2
the only way to meet physicality is with physicality			0
we felt we did n’t do that at @entity42 and i think we put that right today			0
' we ’ve seen how good @entity8 are when they ’re on the front foot and playing well , but it ’s also about how you deal with having an off - day and coming to a side who are very motivated			1
’ in many ways , this was a throw - back contest ; awash with mud and bad - tempered needle as two pedigree packs jostled for supremacy			0
@entity26 centre @entity118 had to leave the pitch injured in the first - half after suffering a bang to the calf having been taken apart in the previous clash between the sides , the @entity1 forwards channelled their angst to deliver a performance full of driving power			1
they won a series of scrum penalties , although their line - out was hit and miss throughout			0
@entity133 and @entity134 had landed a penalty apiece when @entity1 claimed their solitary try in the 17th minute			2
it came in fitting fashion , from a close - range rolling maul in the @entity8 22 which backs @entity140 and @entity141 joined to help force @entity21 over the line			1
fast - forward to the 80th minute and @entity33 ’s try came in the same place , by the same method			0
aside from those scores , both defences held firm and the @entity1 relied on three more penalties by @entity134			2
@entity8 had several chances to hit back in the last 20 minutes but it was a day when the bounce of the ball and the interpretation of the officials did n’t fall in their favour			2
@entity158 of @entity8 is hauled down by @entity1 's @entity21 during the @entity4 clash at @entity13 @entity1 on the attack again during the 17 - 8 victory over @entity8 to move up to fifth in the @entity4 they were forced to cope without @entity118 for the majority of the game as their @entity26 centre went off after suffering a bang to the calf			1
@entity25 featured in the visitors ’ midfield and thought he had claimed his maiden first - team try in union in the 31st minute , but it was ruled out as the pass he received from @entity158 was deemed to have gone forward			0
it was one of several close calls which went against @entity8 and their head coach , @entity175 , said : ‘ we were on the wrong side of the referee and we could n’t adapt			1
@entity33 scored a late try for the visitors but it was n't enough to secure a victory on sunday afternoon ‘ is it because we ’ve come to @entity1 and the crowd are baying for our blood ? ‘ i ’m not sure but i ’m disappointed			2
i ’m proud of the way we kept going and a bonus point was the least we deserved today			0
we expected the backlash and we got it , but to finish one try all at @entity1 is no disgrace			0
’ when the dust had settled , @entity8 remained second in the table , with the @entity1 fifth			1
both clubs will be in the title shake - up at the end of the season .			0

home side up to fifth in the table whereas @entity8 remain in second
early @entity21 try guided @entity1 to the *crucial* home win
defeat at @entity13 ends @entity8 's run of five *successive* league wins
@entity1 were *thrashed* by @entity8 45 - 0 in the reverse fixture last september
