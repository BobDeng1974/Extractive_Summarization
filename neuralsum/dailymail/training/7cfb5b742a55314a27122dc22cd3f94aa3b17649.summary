fish and chip shop owner @entity1 , now 60 , killed former supermarket worker @entity2 and buried her naked body in a shallow grave in @entity11 woodland in july 1979			1
her remains were eventually discovered in 1980 , but the mystery of her death would remain unsolved for the next 32 years			1
@entity1 was finally brought to justice after a cold case review was launched in 2009 and detectives decided to re-interview the former soldier , who had been a suspect in the initial investigation			1
@entity20 was told the killer , who was also convicted of a string of sex attacks on other women during the late 1970s , will serve a minimum term of 18 years for @entity27 's murder			1
detectives are now exploring the possibility that @entity1 was responsible for other sex attacks , and are focusing on the @entity32 region where he lived in recent years			1
a judge said today : ' i think it is clear there was a sexual element to the murder of @entity2			1
' the evidence revealed a pattern of behaviour in which you lured your victims in under the pretence of giving them a lift home , ' said mr @entity47			0
' you then drove them to a rural or isolated area and forced yourself upon them			0
' your predatory sexual attacks took place over 30 years ago but your victims have been left scarred for life			1
' i have no doubt the brutal murder of @entity2 followed the same pattern and resulted from her resistance to your sexual demands			2
' @entity1 had shown no emotion as the jury of eight men and four women unanimously found him guilty of murder after deliberating for nearly 23 hours			2
the former solider , from @entity65 , @entity32 , was also found guilty of three counts of rape , one count of attempted rape and another serious sexual assault relating to three other women			0
@entity1 , who was 27 at the time of the murder , was described as a reasonably good - looking and strong man who had a reputation as a womaniser despite being married			2
victim : @entity2 , left , was brutally killed by @entity1 , seen right around the time of the attack , in the summer of 1979 in march 1979 he repeatedly raped a 19 - year - old after offering her a lift home from the @entity82 in @entity83			1
a month later @entity1 attacked a 24 - year - old girl after offering her a lift home from a @entity88 party near the town			0
mr @entity47 the jury heard that as he drove her back he pulled into a layby and grabbed her by the back of the neck saying : ' you know you want it			0
' when she resisted @entity1 punched her in the face then pushed her from his vehicle and drove off , the court heard			2
just two weeks before the disappearance of @entity2 the murderer , who was then working as a builder , convinced a 17 - year - old girl to join him and a teenage apprentice on a boat ride			0
but once she got into the van he drove her to a stretch of woodland just 600 yards from where he would later bury @entity27 and violently raped the teenager , telling his workmate to ' come back in half an hour '			0
when the apprentice returned , @entity1 was said to be ' back to his charming self ' and even offered to buy the pair an ice cream			0
a fortnight after the rape , on the morning of july 11 1979 , @entity2 said goodbye to her mother as she left her parents ' house			2
it was the last time the 22 - year - old was seen alive			0
@entity1 had been subject to bail conditions for a burglary but had failed to report to a police station as instructed at 6pm on the night of miss @entity2 ’s disappearance , the court heard			1
ahead of the verdict mr @entity131 , prosecuting , had described the murder of @entity27 as ' the culmination of the defendant ’s predatory traits ' following a number of violent sexual assaults on young woman			0
he had urged jurors at the culmination of @entity1 's eight week trial : ' you may well wonder why these offences were not prosecuted , or prosecuted more vigorously , closer to the time but it is your task to ensure justice is done now			2
' this man has escaped justice for too long			0

@entity1 , now 60 , was today jailed for life for brutally murdering @entity2 , 22 , more than 30 years ago
