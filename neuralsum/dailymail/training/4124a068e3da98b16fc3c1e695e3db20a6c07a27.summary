he 's famous for his bons mots and his unerring ability to make even the most hardened of @entity4 supporters laugh			0
now @entity5 has proved that his way with words goes beyond newspaper columns and speeches after performing a version of @entity11 hit @entity12 on live radio			0
during an appearance on the @entity18 breakfast show , the mayor of @entity15 was asked to step up to the mike by hosts @entity20 and @entity22 - and gamely agreed			2
while the resulting version of the song might not win any prizes for vocal theatrics or even staying in tune , the hilarious attempt is likely to raise a smile			0
mr @entity5 had agreed to appear on the show to discuss @entity15 's @entity32 fireworks but was soon drawn into a discussion about a recent performance by @entity11 after revealing that he 's a fan of the odd @entity11 tune , mr @entity5 was asked to perform his own version , which , after being tweaked by producers , also included some @entity39 - style synthesiser			1
the @entity15 mayor is n't the first guest to be asked to perform a cover version of the song - just last week , tv presenter @entity44 was asked to do the same			2
in tune : @entity5 sings along to @entity11 's @entity12 during an appearance on @entity18 cover : prior to belting out his version of @entity12 , mr @entity5 admitted to a fondness for @entity11 normal service : mr @entity5 is more often to be found debating politics rather than singing singing sensations : both @entity54 's @entity53 and president @entity55 have been known to sing in public but unlike the tv star , mr @entity5 has form when it comes to singing toe - curlingly bad cover versions of classic songs			1
mr @entity5 's best - known singing moment came during a busking competition in 2013 , when , guitar in hand , he belted out a version of @entity67 's @entity66			1
and mr @entity5 is in good company			0
other politicians to let loose in public include president @entity55 , who belted out a few lines from @entity72 's @entity73 during his re-election campaign in 2012 , and @entity75 who sang @entity76 at a charity fundraiser in @entity78 in 2010			1
@entity54 prime minister @entity53 is another fan of impromptu singalongs , singing along to @entity81 's @entity80 during a 2012 radio appearance .			0
