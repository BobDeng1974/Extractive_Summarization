by @entity0 published : 19:43 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 06:33 est , 8 january 2014 @entity2 feature writer @entity0 emulates @entity3 by throwing letters out of his window in the hope that passers - by would drop them in the post box to find the most trustworthy people in @entity10 , head for @entity12 and @entity13			1
so i ’ve discovered , after carrying out an experiment invented by @entity3 a century ago			1
i left 20 stamped envelopes addressed to my @entity17 flat across the country — on pub tables , in cathedrals and beneath town hall porches — to see if anyone would post them			1
the results varied enormously according to region			2
as a born - and - bred @entity26 , i ’m ashamed to say only two out of the seven letters i left in prominent places in the capital — from the @entity31 to the @entity32 — made it home			1
neither of the letters i left in @entity36 , including one in @entity37 , were posted			1
but two out of three of the letters left in @entity12 completed the trip			1
and only one region had a 100 per cent success record			1
the further you get from the booming capital — with its soaring house prices , low unemployment and , it seems , a distracted population — the more likely the locals are to walk a few hundred yards to the nearest postbox on behalf of a stranger			0
@entity3 cooked up the idea when he was staying with his parents in their house in @entity56 , @entity57 , where they lived from 1902 until 1921			1
it was while watching the cricket at @entity57 in 1913 that he was taken by the name of a @entity63 bowler called @entity64 , and the comic writer ’s greatest creations , jeeves and @entity66 , were born			2
it was also while staying in @entity57 that @entity3 came up with another brilliant comic invention			1
he was so convinced by the good character of the @entity10 people that he never bothered posting his letters			1
instead , he stamped and addressed them , and simply flung them out of the window of the house , in the heart of the pretty @entity82 spa town			1
‘ someone always picks it up , ’ @entity3 said			1
‘ and it saves me going down four flights of stairs every time i want to mail a letter			0
’ @entity0 left 20 stamped envelopes addressed to my @entity17 flat across the country - on pub tables , in cathedrals and beneath town hall porches - to see if anyone would post them last month , a local @entity57 paper , the @entity99 , revived @entity3 ’s theory to see whether it had passed the test of time			1
he would have been delighted to see how honest @entity57 ’s residents remain			0
of the 18 letters left — in phone boxes , on window ledges and bins , in bus stops and on benches , cafe and pub tables — 15 were posted and delivered to the newspaper			1
that ’s a success rate of 83 per cent			1
extending the @entity3 experiment around the country , i have to report more disappointing results			1
of the 20 letters i left , nine were returned — or 45 per cent of the total , with that percentage soaring the closer that you got to @entity10 ’s western extremities			1
i began in @entity17 , on @entity123 , in the shadow of the houses of @entity126			0
i left the letter on the window ledge of a building next to the hallowed home of @entity10 democracy			1
it is no ordinary building — it is home to the political studios of @entity135 and the @entity136			0
every day , dozens of journalists , mps and peers whizz through its revolving doors to broadcast their views to the nation			0
who could poss - ibly be more trustworthy than politicians and the @entity136 ? yes , of course , that ’s a rhetorical question			0
letter number one never arrived			0
thank @entity149 — literally — for the fate of letter number two			0
i left this one outside @entity154 ’s @entity153 , in the shadow of the @entity157 ’s gift shop			2
as good as gold , a saintly @entity159 or passing tourist popped it in the nearest letterbox			2
another letter , left by a friend outside a bakery in @entity17 ’s @entity167 shopping centre , also made the short trip to my house			1
otherwise , i ’m afraid , my native @entity17 behaved in a less than ideal way			0
the results varied enormously according to region			2
only two out of the seven letters i left in prominent places in the capital ¿ from the @entity31 to the @entity177 made it home the letter left on a table outside the @entity181 , the pub opposite the world - renowned @entity32 ? it never arrived			1
neither did the one left beneath @entity186 , at the other end of the @entity188 from @entity189			2
nor did the one left in the shelter of the porch of @entity193 , the stately church overlooking @entity194			2
on @entity197 , my nephew left me a letter in the cafe in the @entity200 of the @entity201 at @entity203 ’s @entity202 during their 2 - 0 win over @entity205			2
a great day for @entity203 fans — not such a great one for the trust - worthiness of the @entity10 people			1
it has n’t made the two - mile journey to my @entity213 flat			1
i headed out of @entity17 , away from the frantic , dog - eat - dog world of the capital			0
first , i left a letter outside the gates of the @entity218 in @entity219 , where degree ceremonies are held for the university ’s students			2
it turns out @entity219 is n’t just one of @entity10 ’s cleverest cities — it ’s also one of the friendliest			1
the letter came through my letterbox a few days later , with a nice inscription on its back in capital letters : ‘ found on cambridge street ! ’ extending the @entity3 experiment around the country , @entity0 reported more disappointing results			1
of 20 letters left , nine were returned ¿ or 45 per cent of the total , with that percentage soaring the closer that you got to @entity10 's western extremities taking the train a little further north , i did n’t fare so well in the enchanting cathedral city of @entity243			1
i left my letter there in the southern porch of the cathedral , by the remains of the old cloisters			2
however , moving north into @entity251 , i had another positive result			0
i left my letter on the outside shelf of the bookshop on @entity255 , the enchanting ancient street leading up to @entity256			2
it arrived at my home on january 6			0
in nearby @entity260 , things were better still			0
here i experienced the quickest of all my deliveries			0
at midday , i left my letter leaning against a @entity264 pillar in @entity260 ’s charming 18th - century town hall			1
by 4.01pm , it had been postmarked by the @entity267 , and was speeding on its way down south to the mat in my front hall			0
@entity57 , home to @entity3 ’s original experiment , did n’t fare too well			1
i left a letter in the porch of the town hall — a short stroll from @entity3 ’s parents ’ house in @entity56 , and an even shorter stroll from the nearest postbox			1
@entity3 was so convinced by the good character of @entity10 people he never bothered posting his letters			1
instead , he simply flung them out of the window perhaps the residents have grown tired of posting each other ’s letters			1
the two letters i left in @entity36 were n’t winners either			2
i placed one on a monk ’s stone seat in the historical 12th - century chapter house of the cathedral			2
as far as i know , it ’s still there today			0
the same goes for the letter i left in a phone box overlooking @entity302 ’s @entity301			2
i know people depend on their mobiles these days but , surely , they still nip into the odd phone box to make the occasional emergency call — if not to post a letter			0
then came the staggering , heartening results that restored my faith in the @entity310			0
my mother left a letter on the street in @entity314 , just outside @entity316 grocers			0
back it whizzed to my letterbox			0
a hundred per cent for @entity13 ! friends of mine travelling through @entity12 over @entity321 were equipped with letters that must have been impregnated with magic pixie dust			2
first , they left a letter propped up between the condiments jars on the dining table of the @entity327 ’ arms in @entity329			0
that came flying back to my house			0
another , left on the floor of the old @entity334 , now a tourist site , did n’t make it — perhaps the ghosts of the jail ’s former inhabitants nicked it			0
that stray letter apart , my friends had an excellent record			0
another letter left on the streets of @entity346 , @entity12 , also came back			0
driving home , they dropped a letter in the car park of an @entity352 service station in @entity353			0
that one not only returned , but a kind motorist had also written on the back : ‘ found this letter dropped at @entity357 ( @entity352 )			0
@entity358 ! ’ by this stage , my friends were so enriched with goodwill that , when they tried to leave a letter at the @entity362 in @entity363 - on - @entity364 , @entity365 , where they had been staying , they did n’t stand a chance			0
the huge - hearted landlady rang them up to ask whether they ’d left a letter behind , hidden under some cushions on a sofa			0
the @entity10 @entity371 is alive and well , then			2
but , if you want to find him — or her — go west .			0

@entity0 left 20 envelopes addressed to his flat across country
only one region tested had a 100 per cent success record *...* wales
he was carrying out experiment invented by @entity3 century ago
writer never posted letters , instead he flung them out of the window
he was so assured of the good character of @entity10 he trusted them to do it
how @entity396 made the @entity396 by @entity0 ( @entity397 , *£* 9.99 ) .
