@entity0 could see a repeat of the @entity3 oil boom after it was confirmed that vast deposits of gas lie beneath much of the country			1
ministers said ‘ today is the day that @entity0 gets serious about shale ’ gas after revealing resources are many times greater than estimated			1
the @entity11 has estimated there may be more than 1,300trillion cubic feet of shale gas under the @entity14 alone			1
industry experts claim even if only 10 per cent is recovered – more than all of the gas produced from the @entity3 – it will be enough to power @entity0 for 50 years			2
heat : chief secretary to the treasury @entity20 said reserves of shale gas were double the size previously thought the @entity11 said the best estimate for shale gas deposits in northern @entity27 is 1,329trillion cubic feet , although their research suggested the figure could be as high as 2,281			1
with a similar study for shale being carried out in the @entity34 basin , which covers parts of @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 , it will fuel hopes the @entity0 energy landscape can be transformed like the @entity41 , where drilling – or fracking – has driven down prices			1
hot air : mr @entity20 took a swipe at shadow chancellor @entity47 ( pictured ) energy minister @entity48 said it would be ‘ irresponsible ’ to ignore the potential of shale gas			2
he added : ‘ @entity52 that @entity0 gets serious about shale			2
‘ it has the potential to contribute to our energy security , increase investment , to create tax revenues , and to generate significant income for local communities			0
’ asked whether it would reduce consumers ’ bills , mr @entity48 said : ‘ it has the potential to be a game - changer for energy security , it ’s another source of home - grown , indigenous energy supply , which we certainly need			0
‘ we do n’t know yet whether it could be a game - changer on price to the scale it ’s been in the @entity41			2
' that ’s why it would be pretty irresponsible not to encourage people to			0
’ tax breaks and a more streamlined planning process were also announced yesterday in a bid to boost shale exploration			1
so far , only one investigative dig has taken place – near @entity86 in @entity87 – although experts expect up to 50 investigative wells by the end of 2015			0
to encourage exploration , the industry has offered ‘ community benefits ’ to residents willing to allow drilling			0
as well as receiving £ 100,000 for each well , communities will be given 1 per cent of production revenues			0
campaigners say drilling could scar the countryside , pollute water supplies , and clog roads with hundreds of lorries transporting gas and dirty water			0
protest : opponents say the process of fracking can trigger earthquakes and shale gas can not solve @entity0 's energy problems @entity112 energy campaigner @entity113 said : ‘ shale gas is not the solution to the @entity0 's energy challenges			1
its potential has been hugely over-hyped and there 's little evidence it will drive down fuel prices			0
‘ extracting shale gas will have a significant effect on local communities and our environment - the more that 's extracted , the bigger those impacts will be			1
‘ @entity128 could be at the heart of @entity0 's green energy and economic transformation , but not by turning it into another ' gaslands '			0

1,300 trillion cubic feet of shale gas under @entity0 - double previous estimates
tax breaks and permits to encourage drilling - or fracking - to start
*supporters* say it could slash household bills after *revolution* in @entity41
but opponents warn extraction process can trigger earthquakes
