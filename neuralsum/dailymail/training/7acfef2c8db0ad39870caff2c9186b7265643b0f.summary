by @entity0 published : 11:19 est , 12 june 2013 updated : 01:51 est , 13 june 2013 @entity2 , 51 , has lost his appeal against record £ 125,000 fine for felling a protected tree in his neighbour 's garden in @entity8 , @entity9 a wealthy homeowner who felled a neighbour ’s tree that was blocking sea views from his hot tub has lost an appeal against the record fine imposed on him			1
@entity2 arranged to have the protected 40ft maritime pine tree axed while he and his wife @entity19 were on their honeymoon in @entity22 in 2010			1
on their return , the 51 - year - old surprised his bride with her wedding present - unobstructed views of @entity28 , @entity9 , from their sun terrace			2
the enhanced views increased the value of the @entity33 ' large detached home in @entity8 from £ 725,000 to £ 775,000			2
at @entity34 last november , @entity2 was found guilty of arranging to have the 55 - year - old tree felled and was ordered by a court to pay out £ 50,000 to make up the difference in his property 's value			1
he was also fined £ 75,000 fine , a record for the offence of destroying a protected tree , and ordered to pay court costs of £ 14,500			1
@entity2 , who owns an auction house , launched an appeal but rather than quash his sentence , a @entity49 judge today upheld the earlier ruling , and ordered him to pay an extra £ 2,021 to cover costs			1
lord justice @entity53 described @entity2 ’s act as ' cynical ' , and said the substantial fine reflected the fact that the crime was one of the most serious of its kind			2
following the hearing @entity63 council ’s planning enforcement officer , @entity61 , said : ' the council is pleased with the @entity49 ’s decision upholding @entity2 ’s conviction and fine			2
' the fine , financial penalty and costs are a clear message to anyone contemplating such an act that the overall cost and reputational damage outweigh any gain , whether it is for a view or a planning advantage			0
' neighbour @entity78 said the noise of a revving chainsaw woke him up and he ran outside to see the felled tree an aerial shot showing how the felling of the 55 - year - old tree improved the view from @entity2 's house in @entity9 at his trial , @entity34 had heard @entity2 had ' paid or otherwise arranged ' for friend @entity88 , a tree surgeon , to take a chainsaw to the tree while he was away			1
@entity92 , 34 , snuck into the garden under the cover of darkness and chopped down the 55 - year - old tree			0
@entity2 's neighbour @entity78 , on whose property the protected tree stood , was woken by the revving of a chainsaw in the early hours of june 20 , 2010			1
he raced outside to see that the perfectly healthy tree had crashed down close to a building , but @entity92 had fled			0
tree surgeon @entity88 , left , was asked to cut down the perfectly healthy tree by auctioneer @entity2 after the verdict in the court case last year , judge @entity105 told auction house owner @entity2 : ' this was a pre-meditated matter , not something that occurred on the spur of the moment			2
' what you orchestrated demonstrated a remarkable arrogance			0
' in order to improve your view you arranged for your co-accused to go around to the tree in the dead of night and cut it down , putting your neighbours ’ lives at risk			0
' @entity92 was fined a total of £ 5,515 for his part in the scheme			0
@entity2 had denied causing or permitting the destruction of a tree and @entity92 , from @entity34 , pleaded not guilty to the willful destruction of a tree			1
once the tree was felled , it offered a perfect view over @entity28 from @entity2 's @entity8 home tree preservation orders ( @entity138 ) exist to protect specific trees which bring a ' specific amenity benefit ' to a local area			1
they can be made to protect any type of tree , by the local planning authority , and they make it an offence to cut down , damage , top , lop or wilfully destroy the tree in question			0
tpos do not automatically cover any one species of tree , nor do they cover bushes , hedges or shrubs			0
@entity2 arranged for a maritime pine tree like this one , pictured , to be felled by a professional tree surgeon owners of protected trees are still responsible for the tree , but the local authority 's permission is usually needed if any work is to be done to the tree			1
in recent years there have been spates of people damaging or cutting down protected trees to enhance the views from their properties			0
authorities in @entity63 , near @entity2 's home in @entity8 , have reported several attacks on protected trees around the exclusive harbour area			2
they investigated incidents including a 100 - year - old protected oak having its top lopped off , and a resident pouring cleaning fluid onto another tree in an attempt to poison it			0
but they said such incidents rarely ended in a prosecution because of a lack of hard evidence .			0
