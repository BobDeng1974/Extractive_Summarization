@entity0 , candidate for @entity1 , was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the comment a @entity5 parliamentary candidate has sparked outrage after claiming mental health patients should wear coloured wristbands to flag up their conditions			1
@entity0 , candidate for @entity1 , was speaking at a hustings event last night when she made the startling suggestion			1
she said wearing wristbands indicating a person 's condition would help doctors , lawyers and police officers â€“ because people suffering mental illnesses often struggled to explain themselves			1
ms @entity0 , a barrister for 12 years , said : ' police , social services or hospitals dealing with people with conditions that affect their ability to communicate can decide they are being obstructive or evasive			1
' they do not realise the person may have a mental health or other condition			0
the way they behave often affects the way they are treated			0
' carrying some kind of identification shows they have a particular condition so allowances can be made			2
' there are also different ways of doing this without stigmatising the person , such as carrying a card with details of the condition but in some cases by wearing a coloured wristband			2
' ms @entity0 's ' shocking ' suggestion was slammed by the deputy prime minister @entity50 today			1
mr @entity50 told @entity51 : ' the @entity52 have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health			2
' silly ideas like making people suffering from mental health issues wear wristbands would only increase the discrimination and stigma around mental health , rather than end it			2
' mr @entity50 told @entity51 : ' the @entity52 have spent many years campaigning for an end to the stigma around mental health ' @entity64 ( right ) , the wife of @entity52 leader @entity50 , joined the party 's candidate for @entity67 , in @entity68 , @entity69 ( left ) @entity70 , the @entity52 candidate and @entity1 mp , said : ' i was really shocked at the suggestion that people with mental health problems should be expected to wear wristbands to identify themselves			1
' mr @entity70 said : ' i have fought hard for many years against the stigma people with mental health problems face			0
there is already far too much discrimination against mental health throughout our society , and a wristband saying ' i am depressed ' is not going to help			0
' we need to massively improve mental health support , which has been not good enough for many decades			0
i hope @entity0 regrets her comments and will think carefully about her attitude to mental illness in the future			2
' political blogger @entity91 reported ms @entity0 's comments at last night 's hustings the conservative candidate insisted her remarks were ' distorted ' , adding : ' it was not that they should wear a wristband			1
that would be draconian ' ms @entity0 has insisted that her comments were ' taken out of context '			1
she said : ' the question that was asked is how authorities , such as the police , could better deal with mental health issues			0
' at @entity107 the chairman of @entity106 said he carries a green card in his wallet to identify his condition			0
' there are people who have come into contact with the police and due to an underlying mental health condition are unable to communicate their condition			0
' it was not that they should wear a wristband			0
