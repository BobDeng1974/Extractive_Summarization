the @entity10 family ’s @entity8 has formed an amazing friendship with their terrier @entity13 in @entity14 , @entity15 - sleeping in the dog 's kennel and even eating food from his bowl			1
the duo refuse to be parted - leading sisters @entity22 , 13 , and @entity24 , six , to start walking the unlikely friends together on leads around their village			1

normally we 've found the pigs shy away from other animals			0
‘ but @entity38 is quite a perky little character and very fearless			2
she 's three months old now , but two months ago , we found that she kept escaping from her paddock			2
‘ she had burrowed under the barbed wire fence and we wondered why			0
but it soon became apparent she had taken a shine to our dog @entity13			2
we even found her sleeping inside the kennels			0
mr @entity36 and his wife @entity54 , 45 , have two other dogs - a @entity56 called @entity57 and a six - month - old @entity59 puppy , @entity60 - but @entity8 only has eyes for @entity13			1

' @entity8 is quite a perky little character and very fearless			2
two months ago , we found that she kept escaping from her paddock ' @entity36 , 44 ‘ she has n't formed a friendship with any of our other pets - there 's a cat and three rats but she does n't care for them			1

’ mr @entity36 , who owns @entity85 near @entity86 , said the two best friends do ‘ a lot of sniffing ’ and @entity38 is ‘ always chasing after @entity13 ’			1

caring : @entity36 , 44 , and his wife @entity54 , 45 , have two other dogs - a collie called @entity57 and a six - month - old hound puppy , @entity60 - but @entity8 only has eyes for @entity13 ‘ she really does think she 's a dog and i think it 's been love at first sight for both of them			1
