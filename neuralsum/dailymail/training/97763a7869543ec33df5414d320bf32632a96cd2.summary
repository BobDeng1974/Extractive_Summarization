‘ while the entire national media was searching for her in @entity35 and @entity36 , she was within walking distance of all their offices , ’ he says in the book			0
it is unclear what @entity23 did or where she stayed during her trip to @entity7 last summer			1
@entity23 was sensationally acquitted of murdering her daughter @entity3 after a highly - publicised trial last july			1
@entity45 is now living in an undisclosed location in @entity15 serving probation for an unrelated conviction , which @entity10 said ends on august 21			1
in his book , presumed @entity51 , @entity3 : the @entity52 , @entity10 also divulges aspects of the @entity55 ’s private lives that were not examined during the trial			1
the lawyer accuses @entity45 of abusing his daughter , and speculates that @entity45 could have murdered 2 - year - old @entity3 to hide evidence of abuse			1

@entity10 first made the shocking allegation at the trial ’s opening statements , saying that @entity45 killed @entity3 , disposed of the girl ’s remains , and then lied about it to authorities			1

’ @entity3 's defense attorney : @entity10 gestures as he speaks about his just - published book @entity11 , @entity3 : the @entity52 almost a year to the day she was acquitted someone in the @entity45 house conducted several suicide - related searches on the family computer , including ‘ fool - proof suffocation ’ and ‘ venturing into the pro-suicide pit ’ on the day little @entity3 vanished , @entity3 ’s defence attorney @entity10 said			1
the attorney revealed that the searches were conducted around an hour after @entity23 ’s father @entity45 said she left the home			1
while last year ’s trial famously revealed that the family computer also had searches for ‘ chloroform , ’ the suicide searches were not revealed , @entity10 said , because they were discovered after the fact			2
he told @entity109 : ‘ i have a hard time believing that law enforcement would n’t check the internet history of the day that the child went missing			0
that would have been bombshell evidence in the trial if it had come out			0
’ @entity10 , @entity3 's defense lawyer , has written a tell - all book about the case prosecutors claimed @entity45 suffocated @entity3 with duct tape so she could spend time with her boyfriend and be free for @entity124 's nightlife			1
@entity10 said during the trial - repeated again in his book - that @entity3 accidentally drowned in a family swimming pool and that her father , @entity45 , hid the body			1
@entity10 also claimed @entity45 sexually abused his daughter			1
@entity45 denied both allegations , and there was little brought up about them during the trial			0
@entity10 said the defence was n't required to put on any such evidence because proving the case is the prosecution 's burden , not the other way around			2
@entity45 tried to commit suicide in january 2009 , and was found in a @entity143 hotel after overdosing on prescription drugs			0
a five - page suicide note was also discovered at the hotel			0
@entity10 told @entity109 that it was hard to determine who in the @entity55 conducted what searches on january 16 , 2008 , but said it was possible to infer who searched what , based on the terms searched			0
for instance , one of the terms searched was ‘ foolproof suffocation			0
’ @entity10 noted that the terms were spelled incorrectly , and that @entity45 struggled with good spelling			2
he wrote in his book : ‘ by looking at the websites being researched , all concerned with suicide and death , it certainly appears that the one who felt the blame was a guilt - ridden @entity45			2
’ in his book , @entity10 also lashes out at several entities - calling the media a ' monster ' , the police ' careless ' and the prosecution ' scheming and ruthless '			2
he wrote : ' this was not real life , it was the media 's @entity3 reality show , a show that depended on name - calling and controversy for television ratings			2
' evidence and testimony showed that @entity23 was a habitual liar , even making up fake friends and pretending every day to go to a job she did n't have at @entity185			0
@entity10 was asked whether @entity45 's lies surrounding her daughter 's disappearance might be indicative that she was guilty			2
counsel : defence attorney @entity10 talks to @entity3 during her trial when the jury heard her father say her car smelled of human decomposition			1
@entity10 revealed in his book he also thought he could smell a dead body innocent : mystery surrounds the cause of @entity3 's death after her mother was acquitted of her murder one year ago today ' i do n't think the lies are indicative of innocence or guilt , ' he said			1
' the lies were there long before @entity3 passed away			0
' in the book , he says @entity45 had built a ' fantasy world , ' and her lies were n't evidence of guilt but signs of someone with ' serious mental health issues			0
' @entity10 said one piece of prosecution evidence he was most concerned about was that police cadaver dogs had indicated a body may have been in the trunk of @entity45 's car at one point and also that a body may have been in the backyard			2
none was discovered in the backyard and there was nothing but rotting bags of trash in the trunk			0
but , he said , people - and jurors - believe in dogs			0
' that concerned me a little bit			0
most people really think dogs can do magic , ' @entity10 said			0
he also strongly considered early in the case whether she should plead guilty to a lesser charge to avoid the death penalty if convicted of murdering her two - year - old daughter @entity3 , but @entity45 adamantly insisted she had nothing to do with the toddler 's death			1
new look : the last time the public saw @entity23 was when this video was released in october			0
she is said to be living in @entity256 , @entity15 ' found ' : @entity257 , @entity15 , where @entity3 is reported to be staying with a friend @entity10 said prosecutors offered in 2008 to allow @entity45 to plead guilty to aggravated manslaughter of a child and serve up to 13 years in prison			1
he said that in those early days he thought taking it might be in @entity45 's best interest			0
' there were times , difficult times , when the evidence did n't look good for @entity23 , ' @entity10 said , adding that it was his obligation as a lawyer to convey any such plea offers			2
the prosecution 's flaw , he added , was that regarding the car search the dog and handler were focused only on @entity45 's vehicle and did not include others in a lineup to give the dog options			0
overall , @entity10 attributed the strong public backlash against the jury 's verdict to a lack of understanding about the judicial system and because ' a lot of people bought into the hype ' that @entity45 must have been guilty			1
he noted that jurors who gave media interviews after the trial said they waited for weeks for strong evidence that never came			0
' we need to talk about whether an actual murder occurred , ' he said			0
' that 's where the focus should have been , and it never was			0
' @entity10 declined to comment on what @entity45 is doing these days and on how often he talks to her			2
he said he promised her confidentiality when she agreed that he could write his book , in which she did not participate			0
parents : @entity45 and @entity3 both lied to cover up what really happened to @entity3 , claims @entity10 ' she 's doing a lot better than she was in prison , ' @entity10 said , but then added : ' she 's a prisoner of her own freedom			1
' @entity45 , he said , ' would not entertain it for a second '			0
as he became more familiar with the state 's mostly circumstantial case , @entity10 said he grew convinced she would be acquitted by a jury – as she was a year ago today of all charges except for four misdemeanors of lying to investigators			1
' there was nothing in the trial that ever made me think @entity23 was guilty of anything as related to the murder , ' @entity10 said			2
' every single piece of evidence favored us			0
' he told @entity329 ' @entity328 : ' i think @entity3 's story , the whole case , was a media phenomenon			0
and i say that because she was young , pretty and white			0
' if it did n't have those elements to it i do n't think it would have taken off			0
' prosecutors claimed @entity45 suffocated @entity3 with duct tape so she could spend time with her boyfriend and be free for @entity124 's nightlife .			2
