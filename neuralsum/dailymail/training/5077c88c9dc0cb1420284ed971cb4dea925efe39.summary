@entity18 , 39 , of @entity19 , @entity20 , has said that he did n't know the puppy - now named @entity22 - was attached to his vehicle on the morning of november 21 before he drove off - a claim @entity19 police say is supported by surveillance footage outside his home			1
once he pulled over , he made a discovery so horrifying that he fled about 100 yards to escape its sight			0
crumpled and bloody , he said the dog never made a sound while lying limp on the roadway			2
' i was just so devastated by what i saw , ' mr @entity18 told the @entity50			1
' it still makes me emotional just thinking about it			0
' he initially told police he had never seen the dog before , not realizing it as the puppy he had given to @entity8 's daughter several months earlier			1
it was a gift @entity8 had tried to return to him before			1
rising up : bandaged from his ears down to his toes , the once critically injured pup shows some strength during his recovery unwanted gift : @entity68 , pictured with @entity8 here , told police he had given the dog to @entity8 's five - year - old daughter but not wanting it , @entity8 tried to return it against @entity68 's will @entity18 said it was only after a flurry of media attention to capture the culprit - with rewards doubling to $ 5,000 - that he texted @entity8 , asking : ' please tell me you still have that dog			1
' ' she told me she did , ' he told the paper			0
healing : trooper is seen here on december 10 with a toy before him , his face noted by the humane society as nearly all healed but weeks before the incident , he said @entity8 called him complaining about the puppy , saying the animal was sick and too timid			2

footage taken outside @entity68 's apartment complex on the night of november 20 shows a car pull up to his truck around 10pm			1
he recognized it as his ex-wife 's			2
her son can then be seen leading the animal to the back of the truck , attaching him to the hitch of the trailer , and walking away			2
mr @entity18 said that he likely did not see the canine because it was either hiding or taking a snooze under the truck			1
' he must have been asleep , ' mr @entity18 said			2
' she said he was a really shy dog , so maybe he did n't want to come out if he saw me			2
' @entity8 was arrested on thursday on suspicion of felony animal abuse			1
mr @entity18 does n't think @entity8 intended for him to take off with the dog tied to his truck			1

i mean , just because she 's my ex-wife i do n't want to see her go to jail			2
she has kids , ' he said			0

but she is a sweet person , and i do n’t think she would just leave him there thinking this would happen , ' he said after her arrest			0

treats : the humane society reports numerous gifts , cards and donations sent to them since his injuries last month , with @entity22 seen here enjoying a cookie sent in open hearts : along with the gifts , some pictured , the humane society rewards an overwhelming interest in adopting the dog once he has recovered bright future : the greatest worry for veterinarians was @entity22 's front right leg they were n't initially sure they would be able to save ' trooper is eating and drinking normally and he is walking on his own several times a day , ' the @entity186 wrote earlier this month on his dramatic improvement			1
initial fears that he may lose one of his front legs have passed and he is expected to keep them all			0
