@entity1 prosecuting attorney @entity0 announced on monday night that @entity2 would not be indicted in a bizarre press conference that instead found others to blame			1
in the 25 - minute announcement , he slammed news outlets and social media - suggesting they were responsible for the tension after the august 9 shooting , rather than the shooting itself			1
' the most significant challenge encountered in this investigation has been the 24 - hour news cycle and its insatiable appetite for something , for anything to talk about , following closely behind with the non-stop rumors on social media , ' he said			1
' remember that time social media shot an unarmed teenager , and left his body on the street for four hours ? @entity32 remembers , ' actor @entity31 tweeted			2
author @entity33 said : ' social media is n't the problem			2
shooting children is the problem			0
' writer and activist @entity38 added : ' @entity32 is blaming social media again			0
meanwhile , if it were n't for social media , we would n't even know about # @entity44			0
' @entity0 also turned on the witnesses , saying their statements were largely inconsistent and ' some were completely refuted by the physical evidence '			1
no charges : @entity50 , left , was shot dead by @entity44 police officer @entity2 , pictured right in an evidence photo , in august but on monday , it was announced that he will not be indicted fighting back : after the press conference , @entity53 users ridiculed @entity0 's insinuation that the media and social media were to blame for the tension after the shooting , rather than the shooting itself annoyed : another user , actor @entity31 , also expresses his shock over the bizarre finger pointing in another poor choice of words , @entity0 said the 12 - person grand jury ' gave up their lives ' while combing over the evidence and meeting with experts			1
@entity72 's legal expert @entity71 called the press conference ' an extended whine ' and said it was ' entirely inappropriate and embarrassing '			0
the grand jury ultimately decided that @entity2 would not face a trial for shooting dead 18 - year - old @entity50 in broad daylight in @entity44 , @entity78 in august			1
following the death , there were mass - sometimes violent - demonstrations in @entity44 and across the country as protesters called for the police officer to be held accountable			0
on monday , @entity0 released details about the incident , including how @entity50 allegedly taunted @entity2 in his police car , saying he was ' too much of a p * * * y to shoot me ' after the officer asked him and a friend to walk on the sidewalk instead of in the road			1
a confrontation ensued and @entity2 claimed he felt overpowered by the 6ft 5 teen , who he went on to fire at 12 times			2
anger : protesters parade in the parking lot of a burning auto parts store in @entity44 on monday night after @entity0 announced that the police officer would not be indicted in the shooting @entity106 also commented on how @entity0 's announcement , which detailed the police investigation and decision , also implicitly dismissed the need for a trial			1
' the point of a grand jury is n't to determine beyond a shadow of a doubt what actually happened , ' @entity113 wrote			0
' it 's to determine whether there 's probable cause for an indictment , which requires a significantly lower standard of proof			0
' @entity124 appeared to turn the grand jury into an exercise in sorting out the former rather than the latter suggested he wanted no part of a trial			0
' @entity31 added on @entity53 : ' if only there were some process , perhaps a legal process , to present conflicting accounts and statements , weigh them , and come to a verdict			2

@entity1 prosecuting attorney @entity0 announced on monday that @entity2 would not be indicted for killing @entity50
he turned on the media and *internet* users by hinting they were responsible for the tension after the shooting - rather than the shooting itself
@entity53 users promptly ridiculed the claim
