@entity0 is challenging @entity1 to cross the @entity2 for the first time in his career and face him at @entity6 ’s @entity5			1
@entity1 earned recognition as the world ’s supreme super-middleweight when he defeated @entity0 in the final of the @entity12 tournament in @entity13			1
but the @entity14 has fought only twice in the three years and three months since that points victory and the @entity17 are now ordering a mega rematch between him and @entity0 with both their belts on the line			1
@entity0 wants a fight with @entity1 to take place at the home of @entity6 @entity0 was last in the ring when he defeated @entity26 at @entity27 last summer @entity1 is that organisation ’s ‘ super ’ champion , @entity0 the holder of their ‘ regular ’ world title			1
the @entity33 is daring the man who calls himself @entity1 to nerve himself for a first fight outside the @entity37			1
‘ i fought him in the @entity14 , ’ @entity0 says			1
‘ now it ’s only right that he comes over here			0
to be a truly great champion you have to box overseas			0
‘ @entity1 needs to be forced to travel out of his comfort zone			1
he will discover that i ’m a very different animal here than i was that night on the @entity44			0
’ @entity0 would love the fight with @entity1 to take place at the @entity5 where his team @entity6 play @entity0 clearly has n't been slacking off since last summer as this picture posted on @entity50 shows @entity1 ( left ) signed with @entity53 's @entity52 promotional company earlier this year that evening of december 17 , 2011 represented @entity1 ’s only fight in more than six years outside his native @entity55 , where the overwhelming majority of his bouts have taken place			1
the closest he has come to risking his unbeaten record abroad has been in two relatively insignificant fights in the @entity61 in 2007 and 2008			0
@entity0 suspects @entity1 believes he will relinquish the @entity17 belt , as he did his @entity64 world championship last month			1
but he warns : ‘ i vacated the @entity64 title so as not to delay @entity66 from getting his chance any longer			2
but i ’m not giving up the @entity17 title			1
’ @entity0 is aware that without him bringing a belt to the table there would be little incentive for @entity74 to go ahead with a fight in @entity76 , which is one of the @entity33 ’s two remaining ambitions			1
@entity0 lost to @entity1 on points back in december 2011 in @entity13 , @entity80 that defeat for the @entity33 was one of only two in his career as a professional the other is to box at the ground of his beloved @entity6 , which was the potential venue for a clash with @entity14 ’s veteran idol @entity91			1
@entity0 accepts that the @entity17 mandatory ruling means @entity1 must now take the place of @entity91 in those talks			1
the @entity17 are giving them until the end of this month to negotiate terms , before putting the fight out to purse bids			2
@entity0 expects that to happen , which might necessitate a change of dates			2
promoter @entity103 , with whom he meets this week to discuss strategy for the negotiations , is provisionally holding the @entity5 for may 30			2
that is the night of the @entity108 final and there would be a sizeable over-carry of tv viewers from @entity27 on to pay - per - view with @entity113			0
but @entity0 says : ‘ that is already short notice for me and if we have to wait for purse bids there wo n’t be time for proper training camps for either of us			2
i would hope we can find another date in middle to late june			0
’ he has been pondering retirement since his brutal ko of @entity26 at @entity27			0
that remains an option , even though he has kept working in the gym to maintain an impressive physique , as a recent picture posted on @entity50 reveals			0
@entity0 had been due to face @entity74 ( left ) but was forced out with an injury @entity0 is also keen to fight ring legend @entity91 ( left ) who lost to @entity131 last year ‘ i will only get back in the ring for a fight that really floats my boat , ’ says @entity0			1
‘ and when you think about it , beating @entity1 in @entity137 would be a fantastic way to end my career			2
’ highly regarded though @entity1 is , such a triumph is not beyond the realm of possibility			2
in fact , the timing would offer @entity0 his best chance of avenging one of the only two losses on his record – as well as inflicting a first defeat on @entity1			1
embroiled in promotional disputes and plagued by injuries , @entity1 has fought only once in two - and - a - half years			2
and that was a full year and four months ago in a points victory over @entity154 , who had failed to make the weight and mostly went through the motions of a non-title bout			0
@entity0 says : ‘ the nine months since i knocked out @entity26 is the longest i ’ve been out but @entity1 has to be really rusty			1
‘ also , a lot went wrong for me in that @entity12 final			0
i was looking forward to appearing in @entity160 but it was moved to @entity13			0
out on the shore in the cold of mid-winter			0
the date was pushed back so i had to hang around in @entity14 a lot longer than planned			0
it ended up a week before @entity167 and my mind was on getting home to the family instead of the fight			0
‘ it ’ll be very different in the @entity173 summer			0
’ and what more pleasant time could there be to re-float the boat ?			0

@entity0 has been ordered to face @entity1 by the @entity17
@entity0 and @entity1 hold different *versions* of the super-middleweight title
@entity0 wants to face @entity1 at the @entity5 , home of @entity6
@entity1 *comprehensively* *outpointed* @entity0 in their first meeting in 2011
