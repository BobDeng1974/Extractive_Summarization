the prime minister will take part in a debate on the global economy with an unknown group of ministers , business leaders and academics from around the world			1
but his attendance at the heavily - guarded event is certain to spark controversy after mr @entity2 once promised to lead the ' most open and transparent government in the world '			1
secret : @entity2 , pictured in @entity21 today , is to attend the @entity4 conference tonight , but @entity23 said it was a private meeting and will not say who he meets cunning plan : @entity28 protestor and radio dj @entity29 sailed a protest barge right through the security zone at the @entity4 meeting , which attracts controversy every year showdown : @entity29 and other protesters mocked security guards encircling the hotel where the conference was taking place famous for being shrouded in secrecy , the @entity4 conference is taking place in @entity43 for the first time since 1998 and conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot world domination			1
the huge police operation drafted in to monitor the four - day event in @entity49 , which has previously attracted mass demonstrations , could cost the @entity43 taxpayer as much as £ 2million or more , it has been claimed			1
mr @entity2 is not due to give a speech but will take part in a discussion about ' domestic and global economic issues '			1
the prime minister 's official spokesman said : ' it is a private meeting			1
he has been invited as head of the government here			2
' my understanding is that is is usual for the @entity4 to invite the head of the government of the country in which it is meeting			2
' he feels it is an opportunity to discuss economic issues with senior ministers , business people and academics			0
' disruption : @entity29 protesting from his barge , challenging security measures surrounding the event unusual tactics : because the conference is so secretive , conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot world domination controversy : protesters gathered to at vehicles arriving at the conference yesterday in protest at its secretive nature ' outrageous ' : the huge police operation drafted in to monitor the four - day event , which has previously attracted mass demonstrations , could cost the @entity43 taxpayer as much as £ 2million or more , it has been claimed on guard : police patrol the grounds of @entity98 hotel which is hosting the annual @entity4 conference security : a police helicopter hovers over the @entity98 hotel in @entity103 , with the taxpayer paying for most of the bill the spokesman said he thought it was the first time mr @entity2 had joined a meeting of the shadowy group			1
but as @entity111 leader he attended in 2008			0
the prime minister has made great play of his commitment to be more open about who he meets			2
in 2010 he promised : ' we want to be the most open and transparent government in the world			0
' @entity23 was forced to deny that mr @entity2 's decision to attend this evening ran counter to his pledge			1
the spokesman added : ' the prime minister has always been clear about the importance of transparency , which is why this government has taken a number of steps in terms of publishing more data , more information and making details of meetings available			1
' we publish far more information on meetings than previous governments			0
the prime minister regularly has meetings with key ministers from other countries and with business people and others as part of his job			1
' that does n't mean that he is not determined to lead the most transparent government			0
' campaigners : amid tight security , members of the press and a handful of protesters gathered in a fenced - off area just inside the grounds of the hotel , but around half a mile from the redbrick hotel sweep : police are seen to be doing security checks in bushes outside the hotel grounds since its inception in 1954 , @entity4 has held annual gatherings of 120 - 150 invited political leaders and experts from industry , finance , academia and the media , designed to ' foster dialogue between @entity171 and @entity172 '			2
the group describes the conference as ' a forum for informal , off - the - record discussions about megatrends and the major issues facing the world ' and states that the private nature of the meeting allows participants to ' listen , reflect and gather insights ' without being bound by the conventions of office or by pre-agreed public positions			0
there is no detailed agenda , no resolutions are proposed , no votes are taken , and no policy statements are issued			0
cloaked : famous for being shrouded in secrecy , the @entity4 conference is taking place in @entity43 for the first time since 1998 and conspiracy theorists believe this is where leaders plot world domination ring of steel : police officers man a road block as delegates arrived for the four - day meeting several cars with blacked - out windows entered the gates of the @entity98 , near @entity49 , in @entity103 , have been seen arriving the secretive meeting			1
it is thought billionaire executives from multinational companies such as @entity216 and @entity217 , high - ranking political figures including chancellor @entity208 , senior minister @entity209 and shadow chancellor @entity210 and even members of royal families are among the 130 or so attendees			2
@entity23 refused to comment on the huge police operation surrounding the event , which has been heavily criticised			2
@entity49 town mayor @entity221 said : ' i think it 's outrageous that the local taxpayer has to pick up the tab for ostensibly a private meeting of trillionaires , probably the most wealthy people in the world			0
' @entity230 have suddenly got this unexpected budget strain dumped on them at literally a month 's notice			0
' alert : police on horseback patrol the area around the hotel as delegates arrive for the conference keeping watch : the traditionally secretive conference , which has taken place since 1954 , is expected to be attended by politicians , bank bosses , businessman and @entity171 royalty @entity230 has not revealed details of the bill , but they are in talks with the @entity252 about a grant for ' unexpected or exceptional costs '			0
this is only approved if expenditure threatens a force 's budget , which would need to be more than one per cent of its overall spend - or about £ 1.8million , according to the @entity259			0
@entity230 said the @entity4 has agreed to contribute some of the cost of security , but taxpayers will have to cover the rest			0
a spokesman added : ' we will also be seeking funding from other sources to help cover the costs of policing and are in discussion with the @entity252 about other funding sources			0
