by @entity0 published : 20:01 est , 8 february 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 13 february 2013 romantic break : @entity2 and prince @entity3 are enjoying their seventh visit to the island of @entity7 for a ' @entity8 ' on the @entity11 island of @entity7 , a warm , salty breeze blows through the trees and the white sand is as fine as @entity15 ’s baby powder			1
only tree frogs and chirruping crickets disturb the silence			0
@entity20 water laps the shore of @entity22			0
above the shoreline stand the island ’s villas , built in a kaleidoscope of styles			1
there are colonial houses , mock palazzi , @entity32 ranches , @entity34 chateaux , pagodas and sprawling cod - @entity37 palaces			1
they are owned , or sometimes rented , by the international super-rich who come to this paradise island seeking peace and privacy			1
here , the @entity44 and @entity2 have been enjoying a ‘ babymoon ’ — a last romantic getaway before the birth of their first child in july			1
they are staying in a £ 19,000 - a - week villa — one of the most luxurious on the island			1
and they are familiar faces on the island now , for this is their seventh trip to @entity7			2
the patrician playboy @entity57 — @entity58 — bought the island in 1958 for £ 45,000 and sought to associate the place with the @entity61 by giving princess @entity62 a plot of land as a present on the occasion of her marriage two years later			1
since then @entity7 , three miles long and one - and - a - half miles wide , has been a magnet for celebrities and royals — and their relatives			2
@entity2 ’s parents , @entity74 and @entity75 , have come to regard it as a home from home			1
they are staying in a villa near their daughter and her husband			0
their other daughter , @entity83 , was happy to pass up the opportunity to run a marathon in @entity87 to join them			0
it was once rumoured that the @entity90 were going to buy a place on @entity7			0
they have n’t — but then they hardly need to			0
at any time about three - quarters of the island ’s houses are available to rent via the @entity97 office			1
how much more fun to try different places ! @entity58 ’s genius was to make @entity7 a workable business for himself by turning it into a society playground			1
and yet he ended up hating @entity7 because , as the prices rose ( which had always been his aim ) , louche aristocrats and rock stars were joined by international financiers with whom he had little in common			0
bankers , venture capitalists and hedge - funders now constitute most of the island ’s owners and many of those who rent the villas , too			1
but it is this fact that has played into the hands of the @entity119			0
fifty years ago , a former air hostess and flight dispatcher would not , perhaps , have been welcomed with open arms by the cabal of aristos who haunted the place			0
indeed , so capricious was @entity58 when he was alive that he once excluded some guests who complained about the ‘ crocodiles ’ — actually lizards — running over the walls			1
getaway for the rich and famous : @entity7 was bought by @entity57 - @entity58 - in 1958 who then worked to make sure the island was associated with the @entity61 but in these days when money talks on @entity7 , the multi- millionaire middletons seem to feel right at home			1
and having prince @entity3 for a son - in - law gives them a cachet that goes a long way in a place like this			2
that said , they do n’t tend to gravitate towards the island ’s more high - profile owners such as @entity147 , publishing tycoon @entity148 and @entity150 designer @entity149 , but rather to the self - made but unflashy set of which they consider themselves part			1
their @entity7 friends include the @entity158 hedge - funder @entity157 and his wife @entity159 , whose villa @entity161 they have rented in the past			2
so close is food stylist @entity159 to the @entity90 that she even styled some of the pictures in @entity165 , @entity83 ’s much - mocked book of party tips			2
@entity161 is , of course , beautifully styled itself			0
it is a tradition at the villa that tenants — leading designer @entity172 has stayed there — plant a tree when they leave ; apparently the tree the @entity175 planted last year died			0
but no doubt they will return at some point and plant another			0
the @entity119 ’ invitations to the @entity180 included a sizeable @entity7 contingent and , naturally , if you have been invited to the wedding of the decade , you will be keen to reciprocate with the best hospitality you can muster			0
aside from the @entity187 , there was @entity188 , the tennis pro who has run the tennis club on the island for 15 years			2
@entity191 , the island ’s yoga teacher , was there			2
@entity194 , who has run villa rentals on the island for 25 years			2
@entity197 , who runs the equestrian centre — surprisingly for such a small island , there are ten horses and three ponies to ride — attended , as did @entity203 , the current managing director of the @entity97 which oversees the place			2
home sweet home : @entity2 's parents @entity75 and @entity207 , pictured at wimbledon tennis tournament last year , have come to think of @entity7 as a home from home the @entity211 , heir to his brother @entity213 , who used to run the island , and the celebrated @entity215 , an island fixture and the owner of @entity218 , were also at the wedding			1
@entity215 grew up on neighbouring @entity220 and started his bar when @entity57 pulled him out of a ditch after a motorbike crash			1
he stills runs ‘ @entity224 ’ , a live music and lobster night on wednesdays			0
@entity3 and @entity2 first visited @entity7 after a fortunate conversation at a society wedding in 2006 when he told a friend named @entity231 that he would love to go to the island , but that he ‘ could n’t possibly afford to ’			1
it so happened that @entity231 is married to @entity7 ’s only doctor , @entity233			0
thus , she arranged for @entity3 and @entity2 to be lent the beautiful @entity234 ( in the end , they made a donation to charity in return ) , belonging to @entity239 and @entity240 , the owners of fashion chain @entity242			1
later , @entity2 worked as an accessories buyer for @entity242 in the only job she has ever had that was n’t under the umbrella of @entity248 , her parents ’ firm			1
so @entity7 , to a certain extent , forged her short career , just as it helped shape @entity83 ’s book			0
that first stay , as we now know , was the start of a family love affair with the place that shows no sign of abating , not least because the @entity175 do love to socialise — and @entity7 is a very social island , though not in the same way it once was			2
lord @entity57 celebrated his 50th birthday in 1976 with a wild bash on the theme of @entity265 , at which everyone wore gold			1
for his 60th birthday he held celebrations that lasted a week and ended with a grand ‘ @entity270 ’			0
these days , the parties are rather more private , usually taking place behind the high walls of the villas , although open - minded types such as @entity147 are still known to set up tables on the beach for dinner			2
now that the qualification to this exclusive club is neither class nor status but , simply , wealth , there are 17 different nationalities who own houses on the island			2
though there are scions of the grand families of @entity293 , @entity294 and @entity295 , they are now definitely outnumbered			0
paradise : @entity7 is a private island in the @entity11 where princess @entity62 once had a holiday home there is a growing @entity150 - style emphasis on who has earned what , though unlike the real attention - seekers who go to nearby @entity304 , @entity7 is still for those avoiding rather than seeking publicity			1
when the @entity119 first started going , there was a bit of grumbling about the newcomers			0
like an @entity293 village , in @entity7 , the longer you have been coming , the better			0
and there are still complaints about the change that comes over the island when there is a royal visit			2
the security presence is irksome to those not welcomed into the @entity75 inner circle			1
last year , security tried to restrict use of ‘ mules ’ — the island vehicles which resemble suped - up golf carts — to the island ’s only hotel , called the @entity329 , and @entity218 , and annoyed visiting millionaires by quizzing them about what they were doing with the cameras on their mobile phones			1
as everybody who lands on @entity7 feels they are a ‘ somebody ’ , treating them like the great unwashed was never going to go down well			0
but for the most part , according to one regular visitor , the @entity119 ‘ have been welcomed with open arms ’			0
the staff , as we have seen from the @entity180 guest list , are all enthusiasts , and so are the property owners ; nothing sends the prices up quicker than a bit of @entity350 , as @entity57 knew			1
this then , is the place where the newest addition to the @entity61 will , with luck , find themselves toddling in the waves in years to come , and dozing in their cot under the obligatory mosquito net			0
that ’s once they have negotiated the eight - hour flight to @entity362 followed by a nerve - testing short hop on a light aircraft , or possibly by yacht			0
@entity7 has never had convenience in its favour			0
but as the new prince or @entity62 will learn over the years , and as their great aunt @entity62 discovered , it has many welcome compensations			0
@entity207 and her daughter @entity2 , pictured together shopping , both enjoy holidaying on the island			1

@entity44 and @entity2 are enjoying a ' @entity8 ' on the island
@entity57 - @entity58 - bought the island in 1958 for £ 45,000
@entity2 's parents , @entity74 and @entity75 , regard it as a home from home
