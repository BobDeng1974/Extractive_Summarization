@entity1 was taken to the @entity18 on august 30 with a swollen abdomen and was slightly stiff with dark , dry vomit around her nose and mouth			0
doctors attempted to resuscitate her but she was already dead			0
@entity44 , prosecuting , told the court : ' @entity11 and @entity13 only contacted emergency services when they realised @entity1 's condition had deteriorated to such an extent that it could no longer be concealed			1
' it 's a sad feature of this case that had they acted more swiftly then @entity1 's life could have been saved but they chose to try to conceal what happened			1
' at the hospital @entity13 's behaviour was described by nurses as ' strange ' with her ' pre-occupied ' with text messaging while her daughter lay dead in the treatment room			1
father @entity11 is accused of killing his daughter after discovering girlfriend @entity13 ' was having an affair ' the court was told that in the run up to @entity1 's death , @entity11 was ' very upset and angry ' and wrote messages on his @entity66 account about @entity13 's ' affair '			1
mr @entity68 told the court : ' we might say that @entity11 found caring for the child was a considerable strain			2
' it would seem she was having an affair with a man who had a child at nursery and in a period leading up to death of @entity1 we say there was considerable friction between the parents			1
the relationship continued but was far from harmonious			0
' there was simmering resentment			2
resentment [ that ] was hardly helped with the addition of looking after @entity1			2
when @entity1 's body was examined her injuries were not down to some freak or terrible accident but blunt force			1
' we say it was blindingly obvious that something extremely serious and dire was likely to happen in that household and something extremely dire did happen to @entity1			0
' the court was told @entity1 was left in the care of @entity11 after he pulled her out of nursery			2
in november 2011 , @entity13 , 20 , started a full - time job as a nursery assistant at @entity103 2 , while @entity11 was unemployed			2

mr @entity68 said : ' he informed the nursery that he had discovered that @entity13 was seeing the parent of a child from the nursery and that @entity13 would not be returning to work			2
' he was clearly very upset by this discovery , angry with @entity13 and made remarks on his @entity66 account that were able to be read by others			0
' when @entity11 was arrested he told police that the bruises on @entity1 's body was caused by her falling off a swing @entity13 received reassurance from her employer about her job but @entity1 was not allowed back to nursery due to unpaid fees			1
the youngster was then left in the care of @entity11 while her mother was at work and on occasions was cared for by her grandmother or a nursery colleague			0
two weeks before her death , a social worker visited the family home following a referral but had no concerns for @entity1 's safety			1
on august 15 , five days after the visit , nursery manager @entity138 received a text from @entity13 , which appeared to have been drafted by @entity11 , implying all was not well between the couple			1
mr @entity68 said : ' on a visit she saw some damage to the wall of the premises @entity11 admitted causing			0
' asked if okay he said " no i 'm not with her "			0
' the day before @entity1 was found dead , @entity11 went to the nursery and was said to be ' mad and swearing '			1
he told the staff they had to send ms @entity13 home because @entity1 was being sick			2
mr @entity68 said : ' the assistant said he looked like a parent who could n't cope , they had never seen him like that shouting , swearing and raising his voice			0
' the court heard when @entity1 's body was examined doctors discovered trauma to her abdomen that had been delivered with such force that causes extensive and fatal internal injuries			1
@entity1 was found to be extensively bruised and many were less than 48 hours old and some were older			2
the court was told that the day before her death records showed the home computer had searched the @entity170 website with the term : ' three - year - old hurting head and being sick ' and a local surgery called but it was closed			0
@entity11 was arrested the next day but told officers his daughter had fallen while on swings at the @entity179 he and @entity13 deny any responsibility for their daughter 's death			1
doctors found @entity1 had bruises to her neck , chest , abdomen , arms , legs , buttocks and back mr @entity68 said : ' this was a young child who had been physically abused			1
this was physical abuse where she ought to have been protected by her parents rather than exposed			0
' there was a significant risk of harm being caused to @entity1			0
it was a risk of serious physical harm from which she ought to have been protected			0
' @entity203 of her parents failed to protect her from and led eventually to her death at the hands of we say the male defendant @entity11			2
' we say @entity11 did not intentionally kill but at the time we say he must have delivered a forceful blow to the abdomen of the child			0
he must have intended to cause her really serious harm			0
' @entity1 was described as a ' normal , happy toddler ' who just the day before her death was seen ' skipping ' along the road with her father looking ' perfectly happy '			2
on july 30 , one month before @entity1 's death , police made a referral to social services about @entity11 smoking cannabis with children around			1
the home was visited and while conditions were ' less than perfect ' there was food in the house and @entity1 had clean clothes on and there was nothing that caused concern to the social services department about the safety of the child , the court heard			0
@entity11 was arrested the day after @entity1 's but told officers his daughter had fallen while on swings at the park			1
both he and @entity13 deny any responsibility for their daughter 's death			2
mr @entity68 told the jury that , irrespective of whose ' hand or fist or boot ' delivered the fatal injury , it was ' blindingly obvious ' something ' dire ' was likely to happen in that household and should not have been allowed to happen			0
' we say it would be obvious to any parent that their child was extremely unwell and in need of medical assistance			0
' the fact that no medical assistance was obtained until it was too late speaks volumes in this case as to the responsibility of both parents in the events that led to @entity1 's death			1
' @entity264 , the first paramedic on the scene at the house , said he and a colleague got @entity1 into the ambulance to carry out chest compressions but the @entity271 monitor gave a ' flat - line ' response showing the heart had stopped			0
mr @entity264 told the jury he asked @entity13 how long she had been in this ' state '			0
' she told us the child had been unwell recently , had been to see a gp and the child had been up and about and playing 10 to 15 minutes prior to the 999 call			0
' my impression was the child had been deceased for longer than the 15 minutes we were told			0
' @entity11 denies murder and allowing the death of a child and @entity13 denies allowing the death of a child			1
the trial , scheduled to last up to six weeks , was adjourned until tomorrow morning			0
