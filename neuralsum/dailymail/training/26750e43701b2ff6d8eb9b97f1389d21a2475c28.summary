by @entity0 a white sports columnist is facing outrage after he compared the tattooed quarterback of the @entity4 to the residents of @entity6			2
@entity8 writer @entity7 has been labeled a racist by some for his sweeping generalisations after he penned an article that bemoaned the amount of tattoos that 25 - year - old @entity15 had on his body			1
claiming that the position of quarterback is hallowed and @entity15 's body art brings it down in tone , @entity7 said that because of his tattoos , the 49ers player can never be a legitimate hero			1
but he later defended himself against accusations of racism , saying : ' if they were old enough to read , my two adopted @entity29 - @entity29 daughters would certainly be disappointed to find out i 'm a racist			1
' “ it did n’t occur to me that admitting i ’m not a fan of body art would be admitting i do n’t like @entity29			0
' it is the extensive body art of @entity15 - the quarterback for the @entity4 that has so upset sports columnist @entity35 the furious response overwhelmed @entity7 , who had to fend off accusations of racial profiling , prompting his editor - in - chief to take the unusual step of writing a defence of the opinion piece in which he admitted @entity7 could have finessed certain points			1
@entity7 , who is the father of two adopted @entity29 daughters , was even criticised by @entity15 's parents - who revealed that his tattoos are in fact verses from the @entity49			1
@entity8 columnist @entity7 has sparked outrage with his opinion piece that compares the ownership of tattoos to being incarcerated in prison the column which was published on wednesday , seems to take aim at the new tattoed breed of sporting stars and declare that it is inappropriate for someone in his position on the team to possess them			1
' @entity63 's @entity15 is going to be a big - time @entity65 quarterback			1
that must make the guys in @entity6 happy , ' wrote @entity7 in @entity68			1
' approximately 98.7 per cent of the inmates at @entity71 's state prison have tattoos			1
i do n't know that as fact , but i 've watched enough lockup to know it 's close to accurate			2
' he continued : ' @entity65 quarterback is the ultimate position of influence and responsibility			0
he is the ceo of a high profile organisation , and you do n't want your ceo to look like he just got paroled			0
' warming to his theme , @entity7 argues that quarterbacks are different from the rest of professional athletes and should be ' the last line of defence against the raging sea of ink '			1
' for dinosaurs like me , ' continues @entity7 , ' @entity65 quarterbacks were our little @entity96 boys			2
the original hero stuck his finger in the dyke to save @entity101			0
' @entity102 were the last line of defense against the raging sea of ink			0
when our kids said they wanted a tattoo , we could always point to the @entity109 brothers			0
' condemnation of the columnists comments was swift , with @entity15 's adoptive parents expressing their anger to @entity115			1
' it annoyed me , ' said his mother @entity118			0
' you are categorizing this kid on something like tattoos ? really ? saying other guys are role models because they do n't have them ? really ? inked quarterback : @entity63 49ers quarterback @entity15 has made two starts this @entity65 season and is highly rated by football pundits some of these other guys do n't have crystal clear reputations			1
that 's how you 're going to define this kid ? it 's pretty irritating is what it is			0
' responding to the fury , @entity8 editor - in - chief @entity137 wrote a story explaining his employees column			0
' @entity7 ’s message was somewhat lost in his flurry of one - liners , but his intention was sincere and honest , ' wrote @entity137			2
' as a sports editor who also happens to be @entity29 , it is my job to vet each and every opinion piece to ensure that the message does not get lost and i certainly could have done more , in retrospect , to make sure it did not			0
' indeed in his column , @entity7 attempts to preemptively refute any racist overtones			2
' it 's not just a white thing , i hope , ' wrote @entity7 as publisher @entity159 added a disclaimer to the bottom of the column , saying the piece did not necessarily reflect the company 's position			1
role model : quarterback @entity15 of the @entity4 warms up before a game against the @entity168 in october body art : @entity170 is famous for his elaborate tattoos and has been credited with popularising the trend across the world responding to the criticism he received , @entity7 refuted any suggestions that he was racist			1
' it did n’t occur to me that admitting i ’m not a fan of body art would be admitting i do n’t like african - americans , ' he told his website			0
' i ’m pretty sure the middle - aged women at the gym with barbed - wire tats that i referenced are white			0
' if they were old enough to read , my two adopted @entity29 daughters would certainly be disappointed to find out i ’m a racist			2
' expressing his rage at the author , @entity186 , @entity15 's father said that @entity7 should have focused on his son 's charity work and not his body art. ' this guy has probably never talked to @entity15 , ' @entity186 said			1
' instead of saying that @entity15 does all these great things and donates his time to children , this guy is going to make him out like a gangster			2
really ? i guess you just have to roll with the punches			0
' ' somebody asked me if i got mad about that			0
i said no. it 's just a guy and his opinion			0
i could have an opinion about him , but i 've never met the guy , so i do n't know if my opinion would be right			0
