by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:18 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 12:23 est , 24 april 2013 it is 2013 's most talked about television series and the nation was gripped as the mystery of a schoolboy 's killing was solved			1
but in what might be a huge disappointment to the millions who watched @entity13 's blockbuster crime drama @entity14 , it has emerged the second series may not feature any murders at all			1
viewers hit a peak of 9.3million on monday as the murderer was eventually revealed to be @entity20 - the husband of @entity22 's character , detective sergeant @entity21			1
no clues : creator @entity36 would not give away any secrets today but said the second series would be very different he has also said that the programme ' was never intended to be a whodunnit ' , insisting that he is more interested in exploring @entity47 rural life than creating puzzles for viewers to solve			1
this has led to speculation that the follow - up to the successful first series will document the villagers ' reactions to the revelations which have already been broadcast and will not set up a second murder to be investigated			1
' i have a plan			2
i ’m keeping it to myself for a while , but we know what we 're going to do , ' mr @entity36 said			2
' it ’s going to be a very different type of story and hopefully it will be just as compelling and bold and i 'm really looking forward to doing it			2
' it will take us a little while , but hopefully it will be something that lives up to the first one			0
' i ca n’t really say at the moment , we ’ve kept our secrets so deliberately on the first one and it ’s worked well , so if you do n’t mind we ’ll keep the secrets for a bit longer on the second one			0
' @entity82 contacted @entity13 and asked whether the second series would be murder-less , with a spokesman saying : ' in the spirit of @entity14 we 're keeping our secrets close '			1
almost 9million armchair sleuths tuned in to see @entity14 ’s dramatic final episode			1
but while the show started with 8.8million viewers , it tailed off to 7.9million after 15 minutes once @entity20 was revealed as the killer of 11 - year - old schoolboy @entity32			0
disbelief : the @entity32 family could n't comprehend that their neighbour had murdered their son a town shattered : @entity14 residents gathered together to remember @entity32 , who was taken too soon the climax was kept such a closely guarded secret that only 29 people - all of whom were cast , crew or executives - knew the identity of the killer before the final episode			0
actor @entity106 , 37 , admitted this week he left it as late as possible to go on the school run on the day after he was revealed as the murderer			0
but parents were waiting at the schoolgates to see the tv killer in the flesh			0
@entity106 said : ' i tried to leave it as late as possible before running up to the school and dropping the children off and running back			0
' a couple of parents stopped me to let me know they had known it was me - but no one tried to push me over			0

peak of 9.3million tuned in , the *highest* of the series by more than *1m*
@entity13 confirms there will be second series , but details kept under wraps
new *season* could focus how village copes with *aftermath* of murder case
