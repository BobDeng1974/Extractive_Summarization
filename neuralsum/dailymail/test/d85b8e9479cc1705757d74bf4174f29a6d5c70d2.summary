@entity1 's @entity0 produced a brilliant finish to claim his second @entity4 title and break @entity6 hearts in the inaugural @entity7 on sunday			1
teenager @entity10 looked to have done enough to secure a hugely popular victory on home soil , the 19 - year - old emerging from a crowded leaderboard to card a closing 67 to finish 12 under par. that left overnight leader @entity0 two shots behind with two holes to play , only for the 25 - year - old to hole from 18 feet for an eagle on the 17th and then miss from 12 feet for what would have been a winning birdie on the last			1
@entity0 poses with the trophy having won his second @entity4 title in @entity23 the players returned to the 18th for the play - off and @entity0 completed victory in style , hitting his approach to virtually the same place as he had in regulation and this time holing the birdie putt after @entity10 had missed from long range			1
' i have been struggling for a year , ' said @entity0 , whose previous win came in the @entity35 in 2013			2
' i lost my coach ( @entity36 , who died in december 2013 ) , i changed my equipment and have n't been on the top of the leaderboard for a while but finally i can do it and it was great			0
' i had a chance to win in 72 holes but the putt in the play - off is the best putt i have ever made in my life			1
' aphibarnrat ca n't hold back his emotions , celebrating on the 18th green with his mother @entity0 had been six shots clear of the field after 16 holes of the third round , but finished double - bogey , bogey to take a two - shot advantage into the final day			1
that was wiped out by a fast start from @entity64 's @entity63 , who carded four birdies and one bogey in his first six holes , with @entity68 also dropping shots on the fifth and seventh			0
birdies on the ninth and 10th took aphibarnrat back into the lead as @entity63 fell away , but bogeys on the 12th and 15th opened the door for @entity10 to take over at the top thanks to birdies on the 11th , 13th and 14th			2
the 25 - year - old was evidently emotional ( left ) , and congratulated by @entity6 teenager @entity10 ( right ) another birdie on the 17th made @entity10 odds - on favourite to become the first @entity6 winner of a @entity4 event on home soil , but the 19 - year - old could only watch on television as @entity68 conjured up a brilliant finish			1
' it 's been such a tough day today , ' @entity0 added			2
' i did n't start well like the other days with three or four birdies , i was one over on the front nine and @entity63 was playing great to start			0
he put a lot of pressure on me			0
' i tried to play more safe than the first three rounds because the wind was picking up and it was not easy to make birdies			0
i just tried to hit it on the greens but i was struggling with my putting , everything was too tight and i felt nervous on the front nine			0
' special thanks to my caddie , he was always pushing me			0
when we were two behind on the last two holes he said you have not lost , we have not signed the scorecard yet and he was completely right and i just got the job done			0
' @entity112 's @entity111 finished a shot outside the play - off after missing from long range for birdie on the 18th in a third consecutive 69 , with seven players tied for fourth on 10 under			2
