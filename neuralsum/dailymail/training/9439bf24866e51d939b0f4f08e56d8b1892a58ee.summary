scientists have found a new virus thought to be the biggest ever seen on @entity2			1
the virus , dubbed @entity4 , is one micrometre big - up to ten times the size of other viruses - and only six per cent of its genes resemble anything seen on @entity2 before			1
this has led @entity11 researchers to believe the virus may have come from an ancient time or even another planet , such as @entity15			0
scientists have found a new virus , @entity4 ( pictured ) , which is the biggest ever seen on @entity2			1
it is found underwater and is not thought to pose a serious risk to humans @entity4 lives underwater and was found off the coast of @entity23 and in a pond in @entity25			1
it is thought to have emerged from a new ancestral cellular type that no longer exists			0
it is about one micrometre meaning it is big enough to be seen under a normal microscope			2
the virus lacks the regular shape normally associated with viruses			0
its genetic code is twice the size of the @entity36 , the biggest virus previously found			1
only six per cent of its genes resemble genes seen before on @entity2			1
the giant virus is only found underwater and is not thought to pose a serious risk to humans			1
however , the researchers , who published their findings in the journal @entity46 , believe that the virus opens up a range of questions about the history of life on @entity2			2
dr @entity52 of @entity53 in @entity11 , who found the virus , told @entity55 : ‘ we believe that these new @entity4 have emerged from a new ancestral cellular type that no longer exists			1
’ many traditional viruses range in size from around 10 nanometres ( nm ) to around 500nm			0
the @entity4 is around one micrometre big and there are 1,000nm in a micrometre			1
this means the @entity4 is big enough to be seen under the most basic microscopes			2
dr @entity52 explained that because the virus is very big and lacks the regular shape normally associated with viruses , he initially thought it was a small bacterium			2
his team went on a hunt for giant viruses after a survey identified signs of them in seawater			0
the scientists who found the @entity4 believe that it could have originated on @entity15			2
only six per cent of its genes resemble genes seen before in other organisms on @entity2 they took sediment samples from the coast off @entity23 and from a pond in @entity25			1
they took the samples to their laboratory and put them in a solution packed with antibiotics in an attempt to kill any bacteria present			0
the @entity36 , pictured , was previously thought to have been the biggest virus on @entity2 at 440nm - half the size of the new @entity4 these bacteria - free samples were then exposed to amoebas knowing that if they died , there must be something else in the samples killing them			1
this proved to be successful and large amounts of @entity4 were spawned			0
when the team studied them they found that their genetic code was twice the size of the @entity36 , which was previously the biggest virus ever found at around 440nm			2
however , they were in for more of a shock as only six per cent of its genes resembled genes seen before in other organisms on @entity2			1
dr @entity52 told @entity55 : ‘ we believe that those new @entity4 have emerged from a new ancestral cellular type that no longer exists			0
’ he went on to explain that it is possible that they have come from another planet , such as @entity15			0
the researchers do not yet know why this cellular form became a virus but they speculate that it could have evolved as a survival strategy			0
alternatively , its unusual genome could have developed as a result of it picking up genetic material from its hosts			0
the researchers say that they now expect to find more giant viruses .			0

the @entity4 is one micrometre big - ten times the size of other viruses
it is found underwater but is not considered a *threat* to humans
the virus has been *spotted* off the coast of @entity23 and in an @entity25 pond
only six per cent of its genes resemble those seen before on @entity2
