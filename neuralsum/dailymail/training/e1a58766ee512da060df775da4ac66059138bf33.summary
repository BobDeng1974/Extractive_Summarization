despite a collection of seemingly racist rants about ' negros , ' slavery and ' picking cotton , ' not everyone thinks @entity7 rancher @entity6 is a racist , and one of the people defending the one - time far - right - wing folk hero is one of his bodyguards - who happens to be black			1
@entity13 has been at @entity6 's side since his battle with the federal government began heating up in late march			1
according to @entity18 , the man he 's come to know over the last month is not a racist			1
in fact , @entity18 says he would take a bullet for @entity6			1
how does that strike you ? ' ' it does n't strike me any kind of way , ' @entity18 answered			2
' this is still the same old mr. @entity6 i met from the first day of all this happening			2
' @entity18 says the things @entity6 has been saying - ' wondering ' if ' negros ' were better off under slavery , and comparing himself to civil rights hero @entity48 , for example - do n't offend him			1
' mr. @entity6 is not a racist			2
ever since i 've been here he 's treated me with nothing but hospitality , ' @entity18 told the reporter			2
' he 's pretty much treated me like his own family			0
' he goes on to say that ' i would take a bullet for that man , if need be , ' and that he ' look ( s ) up to him just like i do my grandfather			0
' the cause : @entity18 says he believes in @entity6 's cause , which is why he is willing to give his life to defend him ' i believe in his cause and after having met mr. @entity6 a few times , i have a really good feel about him and i 'm a pretty good judge of character , ' @entity18 said			1
however , @entity6 's racist rants have led to public outcry and political allies distancing themselves - but @entity6 does n't see what all the fuss is about , claiming he is just like @entity48 and ' standing up against laws which destroy our freedom '			1
@entity6 has become something of a celebrity in his frontier , @entity7 stronghold since his showdown over cattle - grazing land with federal authorities earlier this month			1
he was quickly upheld as a hero by the right with senator @entity85 dubbing him a ' patriot '			0
however , that reputation is now in tatters after @entity6 's series of racist rants - and it appears he just ca n't help fanning the flames with further remarks			1
on friday , he invoked the heroic actions of @entity48 , the civil rights icon who was arrested in 1955 after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in @entity98 , @entity99			2
her actions sparked the @entity101 and were a defining moment of the civil rights ' movement			0
@entity106 rancher @entity6 held up his boot today for the cameras as he said he ' did n't want to put his foot in his mouth with the boot on ' following the uproar over his racist remarks on the @entity114 on friday , he wrote : ' i am doing the same thing @entity48 did - i am standing up against bad laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom			1
just like the @entity120 at @entity121 , we are saying no to an oppressive government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men			2
' i invite all people in @entity125 to join in our peaceful revolution to regain our freedom			2
that is how @entity125 was started , and we need to keep that tradition alive			0
' @entity6 earlier said that if people were offended by his use of the word ' negro ' or ' slave ' then ' @entity129 has n't got his job done yet '			2
the @entity137 father of 14 told @entity32 : ' if i say @entity139 or black boy or slave , if those people can not take those kind of words and not be ( offended ) , then @entity129 has n't got his job done yet ...			1
we need to get over this prejudice stuff			0
' later in the rambling interview , he whipped off his cowboy boot and said : ' i did n't want to put my foot in my mouth with the boot on			0
' officials had tried to round up @entity6 's cattle and evict him on april 12 after 20 years of not paying federal taxes			1
however they were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people , some of them armed with sniper rifles , turned up and threatened to open fire			0
when asked by @entity32 host @entity159 whether he was a ' welfare queen ' on thursday , @entity6 responded : ' i might be a welfare queen			2
but i 'll tell you i 'm producing something for @entity125 and using a resource that nobody else would use or could use			0
i 'm putting red meat on the table			0
' @entity6 was forced to abandon his speeches about the ' overreaching ' federal government on thursday when his racist remarks emerged in a @entity171 ' article			1
flanked by armed supporters , rancher @entity6 speaks at a protest camp near @entity174 , @entity7 on april 18			1
he was adopted by the right as a hero but many public figures are now distancing themselves following his racist remarks during his speech , @entity6 shared a story of driving through a housing project in @entity181 , according to a report by the @entity171 , beginning his tale with the words : ' i want to tell you one more thing i know about the @entity139			1
' he said : ' in front of that government house the door was usually open and the older people and the kids - and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the porch - they did n’t have nothing to do			2
they did n’t have nothing for their kids to do			0
they did n’t have nothing for their young girls to do			0
' and because they were basically on government subsidy , so now what do they do ? they abort their young children , they put their young men in jail , because they never learned how to pick cotton			1
and i ’ve often wondered , are they better off as slaves , picking cotton and having a family life and doing things , or are they better off under government subsidy ? they did n’t get no more freedom			2

our focus is pursuing this matter administratively and judicially			0
' fears of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped out in a field leading to @entity6 's ranch led federal officials to call off their operation			1
