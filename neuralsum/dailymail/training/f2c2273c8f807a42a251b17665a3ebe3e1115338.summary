it was followed by @entity2 which had just 48.9per cent of trains on time , @entity49 ( 55.5per cent ) , @entity50 ( 59.8per cent ) and state - run @entity51 ( 60.9per cent )			1
best - performing company was @entity33 with nearly 9 out of ten services ( 86.8per cent ) arriving within 59 seconds of timetable			0
when judged against the more liberal punctuality measures , @entity73 ’s two main @entity33 to @entity39 train companies – state - run @entity51 and sir @entity3 ’s @entity2 - were the poorest performers for punctuality last month , rail watchdogs revealed			2

transport minister mr @entity109 said : ' it is totally dishonest to say trains are punctual when for short distance and journeys they can arrive within 4 minutes and 59 seconds and for long - distance they can be within 9 minutes and 59 seconds and still count as being officially on time			2
' taxpayers and passengers deserve better than this			0
that is why we have put pressure on the rail industry to publish proper real - time performance figures			0
‘ i am determined to see improvements on the level of transparency on the railway and i am pleased that the industry is becoming more transparent including the release of ‘ right - time ’ data , for which i have consistently pushed			0
