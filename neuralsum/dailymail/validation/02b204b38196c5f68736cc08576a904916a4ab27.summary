the @entity154 the bag campaign secured a major victory in june last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in @entity158			0
the charge , which will be introduced by october , is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £ 100million a year for good causes , including a raft of green clean - up groups that tackle litter in green spaces , rivers and beaches			0
similar charging schemes in @entity169 have led to a fall of around 90 per cent in the distribution of the bags			0
