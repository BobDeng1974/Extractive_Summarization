a married mother was subjected to repeated body scanning at an airport after being told by one employee that she had a ' cute ' figure			1
@entity5 was travelling with her husband @entity6 when she was stopped by airport security and told she had been ' randomly selected ' for screening by the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1

' when she said that she did n't and asked why , the airport worker responded : ' you just have such a cute figure			1
' mrs @entity5 , who is an it executive , was then asked to stand in the full body scanner for a second time at @entity32			1

' the @entity44 believe that she was subjected to sexual harassment - and they are not alone in their worries			1
the passenger screening program at airports has had frequent complaints that not all passengers are screened in the same way			1
in reaction to this , the @entity9 has replaced the machines which give a detailed outline of individuals ' figures for a more generic shape			1

the need for a separate @entity9 officer viewing the image in another room is no longer required			1

they see the same image as the staff			2
' the images of passengers are not stored or print and can not be transmitted			2
they are deleted from the system once they have been viewed			2
those who fly are not required by law to pass through @entity59 screening - but if they opt out , they will receive alternative screening , including a physical pat - down			2

under the microscope : @entity5 , pictured with her husband @entity6 , said she felt ' totally exposed ' during her full body scan at @entity10 airport the @entity9 has continued to defend the safety of the x-ray devices , saying they expose passengers to the same radiation as two minutes on a flying plane			1

@entity156 had 12 ounces of breast milk with her and as per @entity9 guidelines , she requested the milk not be passed through the x-ray scanner because of possible radiation			0
last october , a @entity9 agent faced dismissal after finding a sex toy in woman 's bag and leaving her a note saying : ' get your freak on girl '			0
