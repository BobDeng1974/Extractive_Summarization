@entity23 @entity8 , 36 , was run over by a rubbish truck in 2003
he spent three weeks in a coma and woke up with his intestines outside his body - they were returned to his abdomen but a skin graft was required
the graft *temporarily* covered the wound *successfully* and held his intestines in but it then turned into the hernia which now weighs more than 2st
he says surgeons are refusing to operate again unless he loses weight but that he ca n't lose weight as the hernia *prevents* him exercising
