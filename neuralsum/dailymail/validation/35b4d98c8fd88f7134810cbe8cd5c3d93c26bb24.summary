it 's been a long journey from @entity2 to @entity3 and the brink of the @entity6 semi-finals for @entity7			1
at one point , during a break between his seven @entity10 – and one @entity11 – clubs , the defender found himself training alone in a park in @entity15 ‘ like @entity16 ’			1
amazingly , @entity17 will be looking forward to his fifth @entity19 appearance if @entity21 giantkillers @entity3 can deliver another knockout blow to @entity23 in saturday ’s quarter - final tie at @entity25			1
@entity7 holds of then - @entity27 winger @entity26 during their @entity6 clash in west @entity29 @entity30 scores in a remarkable performance as the @entity32 beat @entity27 4 - 2 at @entity33 the 26 - year - old @entity2 played at the national stadium three times with @entity36 – twice in the @entity38 final and once in the conference play - off final – as well as @entity3 ’s 2013 @entity42 play - off final win over @entity43 in 2013			1
but reaching @entity19 in the @entity6 after beating @entity27 and @entity44 in the earlier rounds would top the lot			1
‘ i ’ve been to @entity19 six times now and played in four of them and they ’re all fantastic occasions , but this would be even more special because it is the @entity6 , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ we do n’t get the coverage in @entity2 like you do over here obviously , but everyone follows the @entity6			1
everyone knows it ’s the biggest domestic cup in the world and the great stories that came out of it , my favourite being the @entity62			2
‘ now it ’s the quarter - finals , people are starting to get excited			1
i think it ’s being shown on @entity68			2
i know all my family and friends are going to watch it , they ’ve worked out a way to stream it			2
they ’re excited about the game and they ’ re all getting together to have some food and drinks			0
@entity17 , who has played for seven different @entity10 sides since moving from @entity2 , against @entity44 ‘ one of my best mates flew over for the @entity27 game and it was fantastic because when we scored that fourth goal , somehow i managed to spot him in the away fans and we were cheering really hard at each other			1
‘ my dad said if we get to the semi-finals , he ’ll fly over			0
it ’ll probably just be my dad and my brother or sister			0
the plane tickets are n’t cheap			0
’ @entity17 left his family home in @entity2 where he lived with his parents , two younger brothers and sister , to travel to @entity10 at the age of 16 and sign as an apprentice at @entity15 after being spotted at the club ’s academy in @entity102			1
after loan spells at @entity105 and @entity106 , it did n’t work out at @entity15 and he went on to have brief spells at @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 before joining @entity36			0
‘ i signed pro at @entity15 but then i was released , ’ @entity17 recalled			1
‘ at that time i really struggled to get a club , like a lot of players do when they have no experience as a professional			0
the 26 - year - old has been to @entity118 six times and played on four of those occasions @entity17 holds off @entity121 during @entity3 's win against @entity123 in the 2012 @entity124 ‘ i was in the country on my own			1
at one point i was without a club for six months			0
i was running in a park in @entity15 every day on my own like @entity16			0
‘ i found it really difficult and i was faced with the decision : do i go back home to @entity2 or do i really give it a good go and try to make something of myself ? ‘ i decided to give it a good go and i ended up going all the way down to the @entity137			2
from there , i ’ve had to work as hard as i can to build my career to get to a notable league to do the best i can for myself			0
’ @entity17 is not the only one among a @entity3 squad that has exceeded all expectations under manager @entity143			1
he added : ‘ it ’s the whole ethos of the club			0
it ’s what is bred into us by the management staff			0
they are tough and hard and they want workers			0
we ’re in a working - class city			2
we have to work hard , do the right thing and look after ourselves properly			0
that ’s what has built this team spirit and enthusiasm			0
‘ there are no @entity162 - time charlies at the club , we all work hard for each other			2
