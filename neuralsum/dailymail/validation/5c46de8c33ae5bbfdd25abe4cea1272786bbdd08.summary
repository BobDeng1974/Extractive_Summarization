the diverse genetic ancestry of @entity1 has been mapped in unprecedented detail revealing key events the history books missed			2
the study compared the dna of current @entity7 and @entity8 using more than 4,000 dna samples to reveal the genetic fingerprints of the slave trade and colonisation			1
it also highlighted previously unidentified ancestry , such as @entity16 lineages in @entity1 , along with a ‘ surprising ’ degree of variation in the ancestry of modern - day @entity20			1

the study found that while @entity47 provide the majority of @entity8 ancestry in continental @entity71 @entity113 / @entity112 populations , the most common @entity8 genetic source in african - americans and @entity59 comes from the @entity116			1
the @entity16 , a distinct ethnic group spread across current - day @entity47 and @entity48 , provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current - day @entity71 populations , including the @entity119 in @entity63			1
meanwhile , the @entity120 of @entity64 and the @entity61 are genetically similar to each other and distinct from the other populations			0

they then compared the data with the genomes from 2,500 @entity71 people of mixed ancestry the ancestors of current - day yoruba people ( left ) from @entity34 - which is one of the largest @entity7 ethnic groups - provided the largest contribution of genes from @entity34 to all current - day @entity71 populations			1
the most common @entity8 genetic source in african - americans and @entity59 comes from the @entity116 ( right ) - the most common @entity8 genetic source in african - americans and @entity59 comes from the @entity116			1
- the @entity16 , a distinct ethnic group spread across @entity47 and @entity48 , provided a small but distinct genetic contribution to current - day @entity71 populations			1
- @entity64 and the @entity61 are genetically similar to each other and distinct from the other populations , probably reflecting a different migration pattern between the @entity120 and mainland @entity1			0
- compared to @entity160 , people from @entity120 countries ( such as the @entity59 ) had a larger genetic contribution from @entity34			1
- the ancestors of current - day @entity164 people from @entity34 provided the largest contribution of genes from @entity34 to all current - day @entity71 populations			1
- the proportion of @entity7 ancestry varied across the continent , from virtually zero in the @entity119 people from @entity63 to 87 per cent in current - day @entity59			2
- @entity170 and @entity171 provided a @entity8 contribution to @entity83 and @entity64 , in line with the history of @entity81 emigrants to the @entity1 in the 19th and early 20th century			2
- one of the @entity20 groups from the @entity66 had @entity48 ancestry , which reflects historical @entity48 immigration into the colonial @entity179			0
the researchers say this probably reflects a different migration pattern between the @entity120			0
compared to @entity160 , people from @entity120 countries , such as the @entity59 , had a larger genetic contribution from @entity34			2
the ancestors of current - day @entity164 people from @entity34 - which is one of the largest @entity7 ethnic groups - provided the largest contribution of genes from @entity34 to all current - day @entity71 populations			1
' we can see the huge genetic impact that the slave trade had on @entity71 populations and our data match historical records ' , said study author dr @entity194 from the @entity195 , ' the majority of @entity20 have ancestry similar to the @entity164 people in @entity34 , confirming that most african slaves came from this region			1
‘ in areas of the @entity1 historically under @entity47 rule , populations also have ancestry related to what is now @entity206 and @entity207			0
records show that around a third of the slaves sent to @entity211 in the @entity212 came from this region , and we can see the genetic evidence of this in modern @entity20 really clearly			2
' researchers also found that the proportion of @entity7 ancestry varied across the continent , from virtually zero in the @entity119 people from @entity63 to 87 per cent in current - day @entity59			1
@entity170 and @entity171 also provided a significant @entity8 genetic contribution to @entity83 and @entity64 , in line with the known history of @entity81 emigrants to the @entity1 in the late 19th and early 20th century one of the @entity20 groups from the @entity66 had @entity48 ancestry , in agreement with historical @entity48 immigration into the colonial @entity179			1
the proportion of genes from @entity8 versus @entity7 sources varied greatly from individual to individual within recipient populations			2
these genetic findings also uncover previously unknown migration			0
' we found a clear genetic contribution from the @entity16 in modern - day @entity119 in @entity63 ' , said @entity31 's professor @entity74			2
' this suggests that the @entity16 also took part in the colonisation of the @entity1 , coming over either with the @entity47 conquistadores or in later waves of migration			0
' the differences in @entity8 ancestry between the @entity120 islands and mainland @entity71 population that we found were also previously unknown			0
‘ it is likely that these differences reflect different patterns of migration between the @entity120 and mainland @entity1			0
' these results show just how powerful a genetic approach can be when it comes to uncovering hidden patterns of ancestry , ’ added professor @entity259			0
the team now hopes to use the same approach to look at other populations with diverse genetic contributions , such as @entity264			0
professor @entity80 , who is @entity81 , was particularly suprised to find evidence of e @entity81 in @entity64 ( bottom right ) , as well as the fact that some part of @entity47 , but not others , contributed @entity47 dna to the @entity1			0

*scientists* compared genes of current @entity7 and @entity8 using 4,000 dna samples from 64 populations
study found the most common @entity8 genetic source in african - americans and @entity59 is from the @entity116
the ancestors of @entity164 people provided the largest contribution of genes from @entity34 to modern @entity20
the study also highlighted previously unidentified ancestry such as @entity16 genes present in @entity1
