@entity0 : @entity1 , 26 , of @entity2 , @entity3 , died in @entity4 , @entity5 province , in july 2010 failures by the @entity8 to check for ageing shells dating back to the @entity10 could be putting their own troops ' lives at risk from ' friendly fire ' , a coroner warned today			1
@entity0 @entity1 , 26 , was killed instantly by a stray coalition smoke shell up to 30 years old as he rested in a compound in the @entity4 area of @entity5 in july 2010			1
the serviceman , from @entity2 , @entity3 , who was with the @entity20 's @entity19 searching for buried bombs , was hit when the 105mm munition fell 866ft short of its intended target			1
the inquest into his death heard that the age of the shell and its propellant had not been tested to check if they had deteriorated			1
this could have been one explanation why the munition fell short of its intended target			1
experts told the inquest that crucial weather data affecting the speed and direction of the shell had not been inputted correctly into a malfunctioning missile launch system			2
the @entity41 insisted the missile was no more than three years old			0
but coroner @entity43 said the truth of the tragedy might never be known because of the @entity20 's ' flawed ' investigation			0
he condemned the @entity20 's probe as ' unsatisfactory ' due to missing evidence and incomplete documentation			0
mourners : friends and family of @entity0 @entity53 at his repatriation ceremony , after he was killed in 2010 ' i take the view that there should be a statutory inquiry into the systemic failures , ' he said			1
' there has been a systematic failure in the collection of that evidence that leaves questions unanswered and potentially dangers remain for soldiers who use the ammunition that has not been tested			2
' because of the age of the rounds , it is possible their condition may require verification to discuss whether the propellant may have contributed to the shell falling short			1
' it is now quite clear that this was never done			0
what is clear from all the evidence i have heard is that we are left without knowing why there was a short fall of the fatal shell			2
' he pledged to report the matter to the @entity41			0
he concluded that @entity87 died of catastrophic injuries ' in the course of active service when a smoke shell fell short '			1
solemn : the funeral of @entity87 @entity53 , who was killed by friendly fire in @entity4 , @entity5 , @entity95 there were a ' number of possibilities or combination of factors ' that the missile , designed to provide cover for soldiers working on the ground , went ' rogue '			1
soldier : @entity87 , from 36 engineer @entity106 , was taking part in an action against the @entity110 in an area described as ' highly dangerous ' @entity87 , from 36 engineer regiment , was taking part in an action against the @entity110 in an area described as ' highly dangerous due to insurgent activity '			0
a smoke screen was requested to allow the troops to advance towards enemy positions			2
in the morning one shell fell 1,476ft from its target , hitting an empty compound			2
later that afternoon , a second shell intended to allow soldiers to fell some trees hit another compound where @entity87 was resting			1
two other servicemen were injured			0
speaking at the end of the four - day inquest in @entity130 , @entity3 , today , @entity87 's devastated mother @entity127 said : ' we believe that @entity1 ’s death was preventable			1
' the evidence shows that a broken weather computer and use of incorrect data from earlier in the day resulted in @entity1 ’s death			2
' this is compounded by the fact that the investigation was @entity141 evidence has gone missing and has never been returned to the @entity142			0
' we will probably never know if the ammunition failed on that fateful day			0
we believe the @entity41 needs to take responsibility for this so as to avoid further deaths			0
” an @entity20 spokesman said : ' this was a tragic accident , which resulted in the death of a gifted and well - respected soldier			0
' lessons have been learnt , including ensuring that a minimum safety buffer zone of 500 metres is established before firing smoke rounds			0
