by @entity0 most of us remember @entity3 as a candy - colored horse with a comb to brush its mane , but the modern incarnation is closer to a @entity8 than a pony			1
with each new generation , the plastic toys seem to have longer and skinnier legs , bigger eyes and more human - like traits			1
in the latest version , as seen in an upcoming straight - to - dvd movie , the ponies morph fully into @entity20 - teenage girl versions of the animals in high school			1
but in their human form , they also all have tiny waists and @entity8 - like proportions , with somewhat risque outfits that feature miniskirts , tight tops and knee - high boots			1
some have criticized @entity43 , the company that produces @entity3 , for taking the toys ' transformation to this extreme , morphing them into characters that resemble @entity48			1
one commenter wrote on @entity50 : ' @entity3 is becoming human ! beyond creepy			1
' another concerned fan of the classic toys wrote : ' in the @entity3 movie they turn into people - what are you doing ? i do n't want my little human , i might as well watch 16 and pregnant			2
' and @entity60 , a mom from @entity61 , told the @entity62 that the modern takes on @entity3 are too hot to trot			2
@entity20 : some have criticized @entity43 for taking the transformation of my @entity66 to this extreme , morphing them into characters that resemble @entity48 ' they look like the @entity69 , ' she said			1
' they 're a little too sexy			2
it 's an image i do n't want my daughters to grow up with			2
' but @entity74 , the chief marketing officer at @entity43 , has defended the make - over , explaining that humanizing the animals was a necessary move from a business perspective			1
' they look like @entity69 , a little too sexy - not an image i want my daughters to grow up with ' ' we are responding to the desire by our fans to experience the brand in more ways , ' he told the @entity87			2
' they imagined themselves as which pony they would be or which pony they identified with the most			0
' the new movie will follow @entity95 , a princess pony , who travels to the human world through a magical mirror			0
at a human - inhabited high school , @entity95 runs for @entity101 - essentially a form of prom queen - so she can win back the magical crown that rightfully belongs to her			0
longer and leaner : a 1990 version of @entity106 ( left ) , and @entity107 in 2002 ( right ) evolution : in 2008 , @entity109 has a unicorn horn and a flowing pink mane ( left )			0
generation 4 @entity112 ( right ) , launched in 2010 , has wings and a button nose that looks nothing like that of a horse this is n't the first time the ponies have undergone a dramatic transformation			0
