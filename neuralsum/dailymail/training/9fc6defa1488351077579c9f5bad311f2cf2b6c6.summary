would you pay £ 50 for a cinema ticket ? let alone , for a film you 've already seen ? that 's the problem with @entity5 : ghosts - for no matter how many dazzling set pieces , gameplay tweaks and plot twists it throws at you , you 're left with a resounding impression that it 's an action movie you 've seen one too many times			1
out of this world : the opening level is stunning but the other set - pieces just do n't pack as much punch @entity5 purists , then , will feel right at home here			1
from the stunning opening level to abseiling down an enormous skyscraper , you ca n't fault @entity24 for trying to make things as varied as possible			1
there are even some new gameplay tweaks , notably in the use of the dog , @entity30			0
with a click of the button you can ' sync ' up with him and scope out enemy strongholds			0
sadly , it 's all very linear and scripted - involving sneaking up to an enemy before unleashing a silent takedown			1
good effort : there 's no denying that @entity24 has tried to bring something new to the table , but they 've raised the bar so high previously that it 's almost impossible to do that without re-inventing the series @entity30 's animation , though , is superb - and , coupled with the odd whimper and nervous bark every now and then , @entity24 convey some of his character , too			2
other more devastating weapons , from a remote sniper to the more familiar aerial drones , can also be used			0
@entity54 have released their new @entity56 headset , packed full of features to help make your @entity5 experience as good as possible			0
there 's the usual @entity61 to block out noise and distractions , while adjustable bass and treble can be tweaked for extra realism			0
they 're comfy , too - having been tested on our pc for hours , with very little ear fatigue			2
you can even take phone calls when playing and separate game and chat volume			0
at £ 124 they are n't cheap - but rest assured , you 'll avoid annoying your nearest and dearest with gunfire sounds flooding your house			2
unfortunately , that 's about it in terms of fresh single - player content			2
gunplay and level design are as expected - ushering you through each stage and often culminating in a set - piece			1
it 's a formula that has proved successful , but even by last year 's brilliant @entity89 , it was starting to become stale			1
@entity90 overcame that by adding fresh mechanics , player - choice and a vastly - improved multiplayer - proving that there was still some life in the series			1
ghosts , however , seems to have taken a step back - incorporating almost nothing @entity100 did to evolve the series			1
as a result , there 's an over-reliance on set - pieces that no longer have that ' wow ' factor			1
where free - falling from a building sounds amazing , for example , you 're merely watching the @entity111 have all the fun before being prompted to press a button and end the level			2
battlefield 4 ( dare i say it ) may not have held a torch to @entity5 's single - player in the past , but some of the scripted , all - action moments in its latest incarnate are equal to or surpass ghosts			1
this @entity5 , more than ever , feels like a shooting gallery nestled in cliche			0
setting up turrets to defend positions			0
countless ' one - last - stand - slow - motion ' sequences			2
it 's all here , and sadly , it 's all too predicable to enjoy			0
battle to survive : extinction mode puts you in a team of four who have to fight aliens plus , the laughable @entity111 - programmed to flank at whatever the cost - is n't quite as evolved as many would like			1
what is noticeably better , though , are the visuals - thanks to a modified @entity142			2
current - gen versions may notice a slight difference , but it 's on @entity145 ( and soon to be next gen ) where we 're given a glimpse of how good @entity5 can look			1
to call it a true next - gen game would be slightly misleading as strictly - speaking , it 's using a modified version of an older engine			1
still , whether it 's looking out over a vast city - scape , or floating through space hundreds of miles above @entity159 , graphics have a crispness previously lacking in the other games			2
battle lines : @entity164 's campaign ( above ) has clearly been influenced by @entity5 , and while the last game 's single - player paled in comparison to @entity5 , this year 's incarnate provides similar thrills facial animations , although not quiet battlefield 4 standard , are incredibly convincing , too			1
multiplayer is another area where @entity174 excels			2
standard fare modes return , while dynamic maps and new player movements , such as sliding and leaning around corners , bring something new to the table			0
there 's plenty of customisation , new killstreaks and game - types , not to mention more interactive environments			0
notably , @entity187 makes its debut - where four players have to fight aliens in a post-apocalyptic world			0
so , is it worth buying ? well , if you 're the kind of person who 'd go to the cinema and see a good movie twice , then yes			0
after all , why should @entity24 change something that 's won over millions of fans ? do n't look down : running down this building is fun while it lasts , but still feels overly familiar however , if you 're starting to get bored , give @entity164 a try			0
with a solid campaign and exceptional multiplayer , it comes out on top			1
next - gen wargames have started ... and for now , it 's advantage @entity210			1
call of duty : ghosts is out now			0
@entity145 was powered by @entity215 graphics card in @entity216 ( a single @entity217 was able to run the game at maximum settings )			0
follow us on @entity221 : @ @entity222 and on @entity223 : @entity224 .			0

@entity227 , four - hour campaign is entertaining but *predictable*
all but the opening set - piece do not really have a ' wow ' factor
best - looking *cod* to date - but not strictly a next - gen engine
improved multiplayer - featuring the new extinction mode
@entity89 trumps ghosts on ' *popcorn* value '
