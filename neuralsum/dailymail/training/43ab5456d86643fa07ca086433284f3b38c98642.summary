@entity0 tragically died after an accident on his motorbike at a motocross track near @entity4 a 12 - year - old boy described as an ' adrenaline junkie ' was killed in a motocross accident in front of his father as he completed a high ' leap ' on his bike for the first time			1
@entity0 had been striving to achieve the 15 - foot jump on his @entity15 65cc bike at a designated track supervised by marshals but , when he finally achieved the stunt , he lost control and was thrown off the machine			1
@entity0 's father @entity21 , 42 , was watching from his van when the accident happened and rushed over to cradle his son in his arms			1
he told his son he had completed the jump in the hope of comforting him , but the youngster had suffered fatal chest injuries and died later in hospital			1
an inquest was told that @entity0 , from @entity33 near @entity34 , @entity32 had been riding quad bikes since the age of nine after his dad got one from a friend at work			1
mr @entity0 said his son had got ' really good on his quad bike ' and had ' nagged ' for a motorbike			1
in october 2013 , @entity0 's parents had decided that they would buy him one for @entity44			1
the inquest heard that the bike was dismantled and put into boxes to be opened @entity44 day			1
mr @entity0 , who grew up around motorcycles and cars , told the inquest that he and his son then worked alongside each other to put the machine back together			2
by february this year , @entity0 was attending the motocross track at @entity54 in @entity55 , near @entity4 most saturdays			1
his father said : ' he would get a little bit more confident with gear changing			0
' mr @entity0 added that he had told his son , who always wore a helmet , that if he ever lost control of the bike to ' get the bike as far away ' by standing on the pegs and pushing it away			1
mr @entity0 said the circuit was ' a well marked out track with no room to go the wrong way ' and was well supervised			2
he added : ' [ @entity0 ] would always come up to the straight and check if anyone was behind him			0
he was very conscious if other people were around him			0
' he was getting much more confident on the bike and always striving to get to the top of that jump			1
maybe he was trying that little bit harder which he did always			0
he wanted to push himself that little bit more			2
' on october 1 , the schoolboy rode on the track with no other riders after a month 's break from the motorsport			2
mr @entity0 told the inquest he approached ' a big jump ' differently from usual			1
he said : ' he would go up the first part of the jump , leave the ground and land both wheels on the incline			2
he was going a little bit quicker than he had been doing			0
' the bike did n't seem to accelerate until three quarters along the stretch			2
i ca n't explain , whether he backed off or there was an issue with the bike accelerator at the base of the jump			1
' @entity0 's father , @entity21 , said his son approached a jump differently from usual before the crash mr @entity0 told the inquest that he landed at the top of the 15ft hill but did not veer to the left as planned and the machine crashed causing @entity0 to lose his helmet			1
mr @entity0 ran towards his son and did what he could to save him			2
he tearfully told the inquest that as he tended to his son he told him that he had made the jump			1
@entity114 @entity113 who investigated the tragedy said there had been no concerns about the course and said : ' it was marked out clearly which way you had to travel and there are tyres around the track			2
' marshals checked @entity0 before riding , they seem to be very committed to improving people on motorbikes			2
' he added that @entity0 's bike had no defects and brakes and steering were working correctly			0
@entity133 added : ' for some reason or other @entity0 seems to have lost control			1
i think he has possibly become a little over confident			0
' he was the only person on the track at the time , perhaps he has gone a little too fast , got to the top of the hill , perhaps beyond his capability to resolve it , it bends sharply to the left			0
' he has gone up the hill and gone down instead of going round left , he has virtually gone straight off instead of going round the bend			0
' @entity0 was riding a @entity15 65cc , like that pictured , which he had been given for @entity44 when he crashed he added that although @entity0 's helmet was fastened underneath it had been loose and had come off			1
but , he said , the loss of the helmet had not been a contributory factor in his death			0
coroner mr @entity152 recorded a verdict of accidental death and said : ' he was doing something he loved and he was getting better at it			0
we will never know really what happened			0
' it is a best guess that he did become more confident , in you telling me he was asking ' where did @entity162 ' and ' how far did i get '			0
' it is quite easy to misjudge that			0
he would probably have been proud that he landed at the top			0
sadly he lost control after he landed			1
as a result of that it was fatal			0
' there 's no criticism of the bike , the course , the marshals , there 's no criticism of @entity0			0
he was an enthusiastic young man			0
' in a statement @entity0 's family said : ' he was tragically taken from us doing what he loved the most , riding his motorbike			2
' he was a real outdoors boy if he was n't playing sport he would be out on his bmx or scooter showing off the tricks he could do - a real adrenaline junkie			0
' the accident happened at @entity54 in @entity55 , near @entity4 in october			0
a coroner said nobody was to blame , adding : ' there 's no criticism of the bike , the course , the marshals , there 's no criticism of @entity0 '			1
