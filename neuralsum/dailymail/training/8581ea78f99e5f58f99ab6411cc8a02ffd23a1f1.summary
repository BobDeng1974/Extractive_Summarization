@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has claimed it is ' grossly unfair ' for @entity3 to have borne the brunt of criticism in a @entity7 ethics investigation into @entity9 bidding			1
pressure is growing for @entity7 to publish the full report by investigator @entity12 , who on thursday announced he is to challenge the decision by @entity15 judge @entity14 to clear @entity16 and @entity17 to host the 2022 and 2018 @entity18			1
@entity14 's findings said there was no reason to re-run the bidding - and criticised @entity3 2018 for its relationship with disgraced former @entity7 executive member @entity23			1
@entity1 chief executive @entity0 has expressed his feelings about @entity26 ethics report @entity14 ( left ) will speak with @entity12 ( left ) about his decision to appeal the investigation @entity0 has joined calls for the @entity12 report to be published and told @entity31 : ' it tells you a little bit about international football politics that the people who were singled out for most criticism in the report were the @entity3			1
i think that 's probably grossly unfair			0
' it is really unfair to pick on the @entity3 , but clearly the whole process has not been great and we need to somehow get the way these things are done changed for the future			1
' click here to read the full 42 - page @entity7 statement @entity0 was part of the @entity3 2018 bid delegation who attended the vote in december 2010			1
he added : ' the @entity12 report should be out there in full , it 's the only way that we are in any way going to be able to move on really			2
if there is a report that has been done by an eminent investigator , really that report should be published in full so that we can all see it			2
' @entity14 said he planned to hold talks with @entity12 but admitted he was surprised by the @entity62 lawyer 's reaction			0
@entity14 told @entity63 : ' yes i was surprised			0
i will talk to @entity12 but until then i will make no more statements			0
' meanwhile two other senior @entity7 executive members have joined @entity68 's @entity7 vice-president @entity67 in calling for the @entity12 report to be made public - something @entity14 said in a statement on thursday that he would not do			2
@entity3 are being criticised for trying to woo former @entity7 vice-president @entity23 @entity16 were named as the host nation for the @entity71 back in 2010 @entity62 @entity7 member @entity72 and @entity7 vice-president @entity73 from the @entity74 issued a joint statement saying : ' given the disagreement between the two chairmen of the investigatory and adjudicatory chambers of the ethics committee and to ensure complete transparency we believe the full report conducted by the @entity7 ethics committee into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity18 should be made public as soon as possible			1
' this can be done with appropriate redaction to protect any confidentiality required by the @entity7 code of ethics			0
providing the entire independent report for inspection is in the best interest of the game and @entity7			2
' @entity12 said he will go to @entity7 's appeals committee because @entity14 's summary of his investigation contained ' numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions '			2
the @entity100 are set to come under fire for their dealings with former @entity7 vice president @entity23 ( second left ) he will also have the opportunity to go to the @entity104 , even though it is not exactly clear what he is specifically appealing against			0
meanwhile , @entity0 said the @entity1 remained totally opposed to the @entity107 being played in january - and that november / december should be ' the very latest ' if it is moved to avoid high summer temperatures			1
he said : ' if the @entity71 is going to change - and we still believe that it is a summer tournament and it should be played in may , june , july or august - then our view is very simple : if we 're going to have to stop and start our season the sooner we do that the better			0
' we would rather it be played in september , or october , or november - december at the very , very latest			0
it 's going to be huge interruption to our season and a huge interruption to every season quite frankly across @entity117 , and we hope that if there 's still any way that @entity7 can avoid that interruption , that would be our preferred choice			0

@entity0 says @entity7 investigation is unfair to pick on @entity3
@entity1 chief executive demands the report to be published in full
@entity0 : the @entity1 still opposes january @entity9 in @entity16
