by @entity0 obsessing over the state of your relationship has finally been given a name and so - called ' @entity5 ' not only makes you anxious but could also be ruining your sex life , say scientists			1
constantly questioning whether your partner loves you , whether they 're the right person for you , or if you even love them at all , are all telling symptoms of the condition			0
relationship @entity5 not only racks your nerves but could ruin your sex life other common behaviors included constantly reassessing and doubting the relationship and thinking about and picking at their partner 's perceived physical flaws			1
compulsions can involve going to great lengths to check that your partner is loyal , such as repeatedly calling them , looking at their emails or internet search histories or endlessly asking them whether they ' really mean it ' when they express their love those who suffer these symptoms were identified as having relationship obsessive - compulsive disorder ( @entity5 ) by researchers			1
and the participants were also found to be less satisfied with their sex lives than those who did not question things irrationally , says the new study			2
this lower level of sexual satisfaction was explained by a decrease in relationship satisfaction - in other words , it seems that @entity5 symptoms reduce relationship happiness , which , in turn , affects sex life , researchers said			1
one patients said that although he loved the woman he was in a relationship with , he could n't stop thinking about whether he might be happier with women he saw on the street , or on @entity58 the findings , which were published online this month in the @entity61 , could have implications for the treatment of some people with relationship and sexual problems , researchers said			2
' @entity5 symptoms are often overlooked by family and couple therapists , ' said study researcher @entity69 , of the @entity70 at the @entity71 in @entity72			2
according to @entity69 the new findings mean that people 's sexual problems might stem from having @entity5 and not knowing it , report @entity76			2
scientists say @entity5 is a form of obsessive compulsive disorder - a condition that can bring unwanted thoughts or worries , and repetitive behaviors that are carried out to address those worries , usually to no avail			1
with @entity5 , obsessions usually fit into one of two categories : questioning whether you love your partner , or questioning whether your partner loves you , said @entity92 , a psychologist and clinical director who has treated patients with @entity5			0
for example , one of @entity69 's patients said that although he loved the woman he was in a relationship with , he could n't stop thinking about whether he might be happier with women he saw on the street , or on @entity58			0
@entity5 can also become a self - fulfilling prophecy if the symptoms end up pushing a partner away it 's normal to have some of these thoughts in relationships from time to time , @entity92 said , but a person is considered to have a disorder if the thoughts impair everyday life , such as the ability to do his or her job			1
@entity92 also noted that people with @entity5 have unwanted thoughts even when there is no rational reason to question the relationship ( i.e. , their partner really does love them )			1
ultimately , these symptoms can lead to rocky relationships			0
' these relationships can often repeatedly break up and reunite multiple times a week ' or month , @entity92 said			0
@entity5 can also become a self - fulfilling prophecy if the symptoms end up pushing a partner away			1
in the new study , 157 men and women in @entity72 filled out an online questionnaire intended to assess @entity5 symptoms			0
@entity133 had been together for about 15 years , on average			0
although the survey could not diagnose @entity5 , afterwards @entity69 estimated that about 1 per cent had the condition			0
the more severe participants ' symptoms were , the more likely the participants were to be unsatisfied with their sex lives			0
@entity5 symptoms may undermine the ability of a couple to bond emotionally , and lead to stress and sadness , all of which may interfere with pleasure during sex , the researchers said .			2

researchers found *negative* thoughts can impact sex life
