updated : but the new edition of @entity3 's @entity2 fiercely opposes some of the foibles of the @entity6 language today do n't say ' like ' , avoid the word ' awesome ' and never drop your aitches - the latest edition of the ultimate guide to the @entity6 language has been revised for the 21st century			1
the new edition of @entity3 's @entity2 has just been released , and has been revised to take on the language battles of the current generation			1
compiler @entity15 has inserted some strident views into the dictionary - saying that people who use the word ' like ' deserve to face physical violence			2
he also risks charges of snobbery , by writing that anyone who says ' haitch ' instead of ' aitch ' appears ' unspeakably uncouth ' to older generations			0
but the new @entity3 's does make some concessions to the modern world - traditionalists may be angry to discover that the book accepts the use of the world ' literally ' to mean ' metaphorically '			1
@entity3 's dictionary was first published in 1926 , written by @entity3 , and it rose to fame as the definitive guide to what is and is n't acceptable in the @entity6 language			1
however , in the intervening decades the book has fallen out of fashion , as modern trends have reacted against notions of ' correct ' and ' incorrect ' language use			0
mr @entity15 's new edition , published by @entity42 last week , attempts to re-establish the reputation of @entity3 's guide			1
among the words which he says should be banned are ' challenging ' , ' awesome ' and ' issue ' , because they have all become clich√©s , according to @entity50			2
he also outlaws the use of the word ' achingly ' when attached to ' trendy ' or ' hip ' , saying it should be reserved for situations where someone is actually in pain			0
similarly , he insists that the word ' nubile ' should mean ' marriageable ' , not ' sexually attractive ' as it is often used nowadays			0
but he reserves his most furious broadsides for the word ' like ' , used by younger generations to pepper their sentences regardless of whether it serves any linguistic purpose			0
author : the first edition of the work was published by lexicographer @entity3 , pictured left , and the latest edition has been revised by @entity15 , right mr @entity15 - who admits to sometimes being a ' grumpy old man ' - writes : ' overuse will cause listeners outside the speaker 's immediate social circle , wider social group or age cohort to ignore the content of the message , to assume that the speaker is little short of brain - dead , or , in extreme cases , to wish they had a discreet firearm to hand			1
' in an even more contentious passage , the author suggests that people who drop their aitches or pronounce the letter as ' haitch ' are marking themselves out as socially inferior to others			2
he points out that @entity92 did not pronounce aitches when he was young , but changed his speech as he grew older , eventually reaching the top of the @entity96 as archbishop of canterbury			0
' there would be no doubt that @entity92 would not have risen to that position if he had continued to do so , ' mr @entity15 writes			2
the dictionary is available from the @entity42 as a hardback or - in a sign of the times - as an e-book for @entity106 and other devices .			0
