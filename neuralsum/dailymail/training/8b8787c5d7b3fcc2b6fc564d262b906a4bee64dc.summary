@entity0 heads into the @entity1 next week unperturbed by the fact that he has yet to win a title of any sort since @entity5 last year			1
the 27 year - old @entity6 , who has not made a final since returning from back surgery , remains among the favourites to replicate his @entity11 triumph of two years ago despite the recent lack of silverware			1
' i ’m not concerned , ' he said on friday			0
' it ’s always tough when you come back from an injury and it always takes time to get the consistency			2
it maybe took me a bit longer than expected to get back to being able to train 100 per cent			0
gearing up : @entity0 trains for the @entity1 , which begins on monday and sees him take on @entity22 back then : the @entity6 won the @entity1 in 2012 - the first @entity23 of his career out of form : @entity0 has struggled this year and has not win a title since @entity5 2013 ' the standard on the tour is very high , there are no easy matches and it is difficult to reach the semi-final or final of a tournament let alone win a title			1
i think its a very open tour right now			0
' i ’ve struggled a little bit in the later stages of the tournaments this year but i think i have also put in some very good performances and i ’m confident that i ’m back to where i want to be , so it ’s just a case of being patient and believing in myself			0
' things with @entity45 ( @entity46 ) have been going well here this year on the practice court , and we had a really good training block in @entity50 as well			2
i trained harder and smarter there than i had been able to for a long while , so that ’s important , both mentally and physically			0
' turnaround : new coach @entity46 has been tasked with getting @entity0 's career back on track fully fit : @entity0 says he is over the back problems that have plagued him over the past year @entity0 has been handed a tough draw , beginning with @entity22 , the @entity59 who nearly upset him over five sets in @entity61 three years ago			1
' @entity22 and i have had some great matches over the last few years , obviously the last time we met at the @entity1 in 2011 it was a tough match			1
hopefully this year i will be able to get out of the blocks a little quicker , but he can be a tough player , so i wo n’t be underestimating him			0
