by @entity1 reporter published : 10:21 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 09:48 est , 16 september 2013 @entity2 begged @entity3 not to accept the lead role in the new @entity6 film , the actor has revealed			1
the @entity9 activist wrote a 10 - page email to @entity3 the day before the star began filming @entity12 , in which he stars as @entity2 , in january			1
' it was a very considered , thorough , charming and intelligent account of why he thought this was morally wrong for me to be part of something he thought was going to be damaging in real terms – not just to perceptions but to the reality of the outcome for himself , the actor said			0
the actor says @entity2 tried to persuade him to reject the role ' he characterised himself as a political refugee , and with [ @entity32 , formerly @entity34 ] @entity33 awaiting trial , and other supporters of @entity6 who have been detained or might be awaiting detention , and the organisation itself – all of that being under threat if i took part in this film ' , he told the @entity42			1
@entity2 has been outspoken in his opposition to the film , which he has described as a ' massive propaganda attack ' on him and his organisation			2
the movie is based on two books , by the @entity52 technology activist @entity51 and by @entity53 and @entity54 , former collaborators with whom the @entity9 has now fallen out			0
but @entity3 , who said he made repeated unsuccessful requests to meet @entity2 before beginning filming , has defended the project , saying the film ' shows his ideas and integrity and self - sacrifice '			1
the actor admitted he thought twice when he received the email because ' i 'm a human being '			0
he wrestled with his reply for four hours before telling @entity2 the movie would portray his deeds as being nothing but positive and that he would give as ' much complexity and understanding ' of @entity2 in the role as he could			0
@entity2 wrote a 10 - page email to @entity3 , saying the film was not right on moral grounds while soldier @entity33 was awaiting trial for releasing restricted documents he did admit to partly taking on the role because ' i 'm a vain actor ' - but insisted he was not ' acting in a moral vacuum '			1
asked about @entity33 – who was sentenced last month to 35 years in prison for leaking documents to @entity6 , after which she announced she wished to live as a woman – @entity3 said he was not convinced that the army private should be granted the presidential pardon for which she has now appealed , on grounds she took and broke an oath			2
while alarmed by the revelations of state surveillance disclosed by the whistleblower @entity92 , the actor admitted he was also ambivalent about disclosing secrets			0
' if they are saving lives , how can we say that 's less important than civil liberties ? you do n't have any civil liberties if you 're dead			0

activist sent long email to actor asking him to snub part on moral grounds
@entity3 says film is important and *reflects* @entity2 's ' self - sacrifice '
