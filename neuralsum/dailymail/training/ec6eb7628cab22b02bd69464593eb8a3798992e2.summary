ten @entity1 hostages were missing in the @entity2 last night – either dead or in the hands of @entity4			1
terrorists are still in control of parts of the @entity9 plant where a disastrous rescue attempt ended with the deaths of 30 hostages , including at least two @entity1			1
the @entity13 is on standby to rescue survivors but the @entity16 government has rejected five offers of help from @entity19			1
members of the special forces are already in @entity16 to advise the local military and help catch @entity23 , the terror chief behind the attack			1
it is feared @entity23 ’s men are holding @entity1 and @entity39 hostages and captives from other countries			1
in a statement to the @entity43 , mr @entity19 expressed frustration at the @entity16 handling of the crisis and failure to accept help			1
‘ i was disappointed not to have been informed of the assault in advance , ’ he said			0
‘ i offered @entity1 technical and intelligence support – including from experts in hostage negotiation and rescue – to help find a successful resolution			2
’ of the @entity13 , mr @entity19 said : ‘ they are on standby , hostage - negotiating experts and other sorts of technical expertise that we can provide			0
’ the prime minister said @entity1 would help lead a ‘ robust security response ’ to the crisis and ‘ will do everything we can to hunt the people down who were responsible ’			1
lucky : @entity16 minister of energy and mines @entity70 ( centre ) visits an injured hostage at a clinic - 10 @entity1 hostages are still thought to be held captive rescued : one of the rescued workers speaks with @entity70			1
@entity19 will be hoping to be in a similar position with the @entity1 captives in the future he held talks with @entity39 defence secretary @entity80 in @entity81 yesterday to coordinate an intelligence effort to locate @entity23 who is dubbed the @entity83 because he raises funds for terrorist atrocities by smuggling cigarettes			1
mr @entity80 said that the terror gang ‘ will have no place to hide ’			1
a bounty on the @entity92 leader ’s head – currently $ 100,000 – is expected to be put up to $ 1million – around £ 700,000			1
mr @entity19 yesterday chaired two meetings of the @entity95 crisis committee and spoke twice to his @entity16 counterpart @entity96 , their fourth and fifth conversations since the terrorists struck on wednesday			2
the @entity100 flew some victims of the crisis home yesterday and sent a crisis response team to @entity105			0
@entity107 officers and @entity109 hostage negotiators were travelling to the scene last night			0
the @entity16 government said that 98 out of 132 foreign hostages held were safe , leaving 34 unaccounted for			2
but some reports put the number missing as high as 60			0
anger : prime minister @entity19 has spoke of his disappointment at the way the @entity16 crisis has been dealt with so far as he prepares to send the @entity13 in @entity119 is on : @entity39 defence secretary @entity80 has pledged that @entity23 will ' have no place to hide ' freed hostages revealed yesterday how @entity16 forces had launched their attack on the heavily armed militants with a blitz from helicopters on five jeeps carrying foreign workers and their abductors			1
four of the jeeps suffered direct hits – one is said to have burst into flames and another was blown several feet into the air			0
there were few survivors and witnesses said bodies were ‘ everywhere ’			0
but as a fierce gun battle broke out , the fifth jeep crashed allowing some of those held with explosives belts around them to make a break for freedom			0
the @entity107 and @entity146 are also examining the possibility that one of the terrorists is @entity1 after reports that a man speaking impeccable @entity152 was among the hostage takers			2
many of the foreign workers hid throughout the drama – three @entity1 climbed into the ceiling of a canteen – to evade the terrorists as they searched for more captives			0
questions : the attack suggests either a lapse in stringent security at the base , or an emboldening of @entity168 insurgents remote : the @entity170 gas project is located in the @entity2 desert in @entity16			2
although the desert complex was heavily guarded , it is vulnerable to attack due its lone proximity last night seven military helicopters were said to be searching in the desert with floodlights while making appeals to terrified gas workers they believe are still in hiding			0
@entity16 claimed their special forces had captured one terrorist alive and he said the group were 32 strong and under the command of @entity23			2
it was claimed last night that a video from @entity23 would be released in which he would offer to free @entity39 hostages in exchange for @entity191 @entity190 and @entity193 @entity192			1
both are in jail in the @entity39 on terrorism charges			0
@entity23 also apparently calls on the @entity197 and @entity16 to negotiate an end to the war in northern @entity200			2
@entity107 , @entity201 and the @entity202 have all been tasked with finding @entity23			0
@entity201 and the @entity39 @entity204 listening stations will use satellite and electronic surveillance and voice match software to locate him			0
that would pave the way for a drone strike on his hideout			0
looking forward : four @entity1 workers , including the man on the right , called @entity216 , who have escaped the @entity16 refinery taken over by @entity4 have spoken for the first time about their ordeal			1

thirty hostages , including at least two @entity1 , believed to have been killed
@entity1 prime minister @entity19 highly *critical* of @entity16 *counter-efforts*
bounty on man behind the attack , @entity23 , will rise to $ 1million
@entity39 defence secretary @entity80 says the terror gang will ' have no place to hide '
