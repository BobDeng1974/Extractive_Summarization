by @entity1 reporter published : 06:37 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 13:34 est , 10 january 2014 a grandmother was found dead in hospital toilets after doctors failed to notice she had serious infection			1
@entity7 , 57 , suffered the fatal infection after a bowel operation at @entity10 , @entity11			1
but senior consultants failed to detect it - mainly because they were relying on inexperienced junior doctors			1
an inquest into her death , on august 31 , 2012 , was told the junior doctors looking after her had only been in the job for four weeks			1
@entity20 had been admitted to @entity10 for a bowel operation but died of an undetected infection			1
she and 130 patients were being cared for by one junior doctor at night for some of her time in hospital , a single junior doctor was left alone to care for 130 patients on the night shift - something which , even now , remains standard practice at the hospital			1
yesterday , @entity11 coroner @entity32 called for a ban on junior doctors being left unsupervised at night			1
the inquest was told ' a window of opportunity ' to save mrs @entity7 was missed and her medical notes were ' a shambles '			1
mrs @entity32 , said : ' there were very serious failings in the post-operative care mrs @entity7 received at @entity10			2
' the inquest heard junior doctors had raised concerns about her condition , but these had not been acted upon by consultants			1
junior staff were given only minimal support , day or night time by more senior doctors			1
communication between nurses and doctors was also poor , another reason why the deterioration in mrs @entity7 ’s condition was not acted upon			2
the coroner was told poor notes meant it was not clear if a senior consultant had reviewed mrs @entity7 ’s case on the morning of her death			2
it appeared she had ' probably not ' been reviewed			0
mrs @entity7 was found collapsed in the hospital toilets , after days of complaining of being in pain			1
nurses performed cpr for 25 minutes , but were unable to save her			0
a post-mortem examination found fluid in her abdomen , caused by an abscess which had burst and led to the fatal infection			2
an inquest was told ' a window of opportunity ' to save mrs @entity20 was missed and her notes were ' a shambles ' independent expert @entity77 said : ' if a senior registrar had reviewed mrs @entity7 on august 30 , they would have thought something was not right			1
' personally , i would have arranged an urgent ct scan			0
if that had been done , she would have had a different management plan			0
acting first thing in the morning would have made a difference			0
' mrs @entity32 recorded a narrative verdict and added : ' the standard of documentation was woefully inadequate			0
' she added she had already raised concerns about similar short comings with medical notes in past cases and planned to write a detailed report to hospital managers , outlining how she thought they needed to improve			1
ms @entity7 ’s family paid tribute to her after the inquest			0
relatives fought back tears as mrs @entity32 severely criticised @entity10 for failing to give her adequate care			2
after the inquest , her brother , @entity102 , said : ' she was a caring woman who would n’t hurt a fly			0
' she did n’t deserve the treatment she got			0
' her mother , @entity105 added : ' she was my best friend			0
' communication between nurses and doctors was also poor , another reason why the deterioration in mrs @entity20 's condition was not acted upon			1
she was found collapsed in hospital toilets , after days of being in pain mrs @entity7 ’s death has already led to some changes at @entity10			1
these include the employment of more nursing staff at weekends and over bank holidays , better support for junior staff and improved note taking			0
a statement from the hospital says : ' @entity10 would like to send its condolences to the family of @entity7 at this difficult time			2
' the poor care we provided to mrs @entity7 is an example of why we have significantly changed the way we work and placed safety and compassion at the heart of everything we do			0
' medical director @entity138 said : ' we are sorry we failed to provide mrs @entity7 with the care she required			0
since her death in august 2012 we have worked tirelessly to change and become a hospital which the local community have confidence in			0
' coroner @entity144 , said : ' it is clear that the hospital has put in substantial efforts in preparation of this inquest			2
the action plan is to be commended			0
the court has been gratified to hear of such changes			0
