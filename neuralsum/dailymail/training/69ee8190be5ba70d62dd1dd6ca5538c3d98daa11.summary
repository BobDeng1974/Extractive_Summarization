speaker of the house @entity83 accused the president on wednesday of ' trying to protect the bureaucracy here in @entity89			2
' republicans , he said , are for empowering people around @entity62 to do their best and to empower them to get the education that ’ll help them be successful in life ' the bipartisan @entity3 law president @entity146 signed in 2002 sought to close significant gaps in the achievement of historically underserved group of students and their more affluent peers			1
