by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 12:58 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 02:50 est , 11 january 2013 a row has erupted after claims a @entity5 orphan wrote to @entity6 begging him to allow his adoption by an @entity9 family - a move barred by a controversial new @entity12 law			1
the plea from @entity14 , 14 , apparently highlighted how dozens of @entity5 children have had their hopes of a new life in the @entity9 crushed by new legislation which has turned them into ' political footballs			1
' but @entity5 officials yesterday denied any letter had been received by the @entity12			0
plea : @entity14 , 14 , ( centre ) has asked president @entity6 to allow his adoption by @entity9 couple @entity25 and @entity26 of @entity27 ( pictured ) the boy , who is reported to have a debilitating genetic disease , has communicated with the @entity26 family in @entity27 for seven years			1
he proudly posted pictures of himself with his @entity9 ' parents ' and is evidently distraught that he has been banned from becoming their child			0
his adoption from a grim orphanage in @entity37 was going through its final hurdles when the @entity5 parliament slapped a ban on all adoptions to @entity9 - in apparent revenge for new @entity9 curbs on visas for @entity1 apparatchiks involved in a corruption scandal			1
@entity14 reportedly asked president @entity6 to ' come out in favour of children , ' in his letter ' i would be very grateful if you come out in favour of children , ' said @entity14 's emotional letter , according to reports disputed by officials			1
' put everything under strict control , but do not deprive children of their right to obtain a family , ' he said , ' i beg the @entity63 ( parliament ) and @entity65 [ @entity6 ] to approve this adoption			0
' in december @entity14 posted a map of @entity68 , @entity27 on a social site saying with apparent delight : ' this is where i 'm going spend my next @entity71 ! ' in tweets before the ban , he wrote to the @entity26 's ( whose first named are believed to be @entity25 and @entity26 ) : ' i remember you every day ! i miss you very , very much ! ! ! ' he wrote in november : ' i love you to the moon and back ! ! ! ' the disease from which he suffers was not identified but the @entity9 family had agreed to pay for his treatment which is not available in @entity5			1
' @entity14 has strong relations with his @entity9 family and i do not think those bonds should be broken , ' said @entity82 , the regional children 's rights envoy in the region			1
' it is hard to say how the situation will develop from @entity86 they will adopt some amendments to the law			0
' but she warned that mr @entity6 was unlikely to bend			0
' the probability is very low , ' she said			0
loving : in tweets before the ban @entity14 wrote to the @entity26 's - ' i love you to the moon and back ! ! ! ' ' there is a chance to treat @entity14 in @entity9 and the @entity100 are willing to pay , ' she said , ' he could get a good education in that family			1
' @entity104 head of @entity14 's orphanage yesterday claimed the boy did not have a genetic disease			0
' he has certain health problems -- just like we all do , ' he said			0
supporters of mr @entity6 's @entity111 claimed @entity14 was coerced into writing the letter while others said he must have been aided by an adult			0
hopes : in december @entity14 posted a map of @entity68 , @entity27 on a social site saying ' this is where i 'm going spend my next @entity71 ! ' ' this is all being done in order to make @entity5 look bad again , ' said mp @entity122			1
' to provoke a child like that -- i just can not imagine how someone could do that			0
' @entity12 children 's ombudsman @entity127 said the story amounted to ' shameless speculation ' and said the @entity9 family could still pay for the child 's treatment - but could not adopt him			2
the @entity9 curbs on @entity5 were imposed after claims that senior officials were involved in a corruption scandal that led to the death of lawyer @entity138 in a @entity1 jail , and a subsequent cover up			2
@entity1 hit back by banning any @entity9 adoptions of @entity5 children			1
around 1,000 orphans a year - many seriously disabled - have been adopted by caring @entity9 parents and dozens were in the final stages of approval			2
some 60,000 children have been adopted to the @entity9 since the @entity149 collapsed over two decades ago			2
such adoptions are now banned , sparking an outcry that the children involved are now being used as ' political footballs ' caught in a diplomatic war between @entity1 and @entity155			0
thousands of @entity5 are expected to protest the adoption ban this weekend .			2

@entity14 , 14 , asked for ban on @entity9 adoptions to be lifted
*teenager* wants to be adopted by family living in @entity27
he called on @entity5 leader to ' come out in favour of children '
