a @entity1 politician who said she wanted to send immigrants back home is set to selected to stand as an mp in a key target seat			1
@entity6 sparked a racism row last year after she was recorded discussing the number of foreigners entering the @entity10 and remarking : ‘ i just want to send the lot back , but i ca n’t say that			1
’ now she has been chosen by activists to contest the seat of @entity15 for @entity1 , which she came within 700 votes of winning as a @entity18 candidate in 2010			1
@entity1 star : @entity6 , who last year faced racism storm after being caught on camera saying all immigrants in @entity10 should be sent back home , will stand for the party in @entity15 mrs @entity6 dramatically quit the @entity18 last year , after ambushing @entity25 to say she was joining @entity26 ’s @entity1			1
she claimed she was leaving because the @entity27 are ‘ no longer the party of aspiration ’			1
at the last election she stood for the conservatives in @entity15 against veteran @entity32 mp @entity31 , and eroded his majority to just 714 votes			2
mrs @entity6 , who a councillor on @entity36 and @entity37 , claims @entity1 will ‘ throw the kitchen sink ’ at winning the marginal seat			1
in 2010 , @entity32 won with 32.7 per cent of the vote , just ahead of the @entity27 on 30.5 per cent , with @entity1 in fourth on 6.2 per cent			1
but an opinion poll carried out by @entity42 last month put @entity1 on course to beat the @entity27			1
it suggest @entity32 had the backing of 38 per cent of voters , @entity1 27 per cent and the @entity18 20 per cent			2
mr @entity26 claims his party is now taking votes from both @entity32 and the @entity27 , and @entity15 is a key target for @entity1			1
mrs @entity6 will hope to benefit from local recognition after standing in the seat in 2010			1
but after defecting to @entity1 an astonishing video emerged in which mrs @entity6 expressed her views on immigration			1
the video was filmed by mrs @entity6 's ex-husband @entity54 in 2008 but she has said she stands by her comments mrs @entity6 was recorded saying : ' i just want to send the lot back , but i ca n't say that the video was shot in 2008 by her then - husband @entity54 , and saw her recording a series of political messages			1
in one take , she said : ‘ we must basically repatriate those that should n’t be here			0
that ’s not quite policy yet			0
maybe i should soften it a bit			0
’ she then added : ‘ ok			0
’ @entity54 is then heard to mutter : ‘ @entity72			0
’ veteran labour mp @entity31 is standing down in @entity15 , leaving the seat open to challenge in the very next take , mrs @entity6 – a @entity74 councillor and deputy leader of the local @entity1 party – says : ‘ multiculturalism is dead , i ’m allowed to say that , but maybe @entity80 is waving the @entity72 flag a bit			1
‘ we must control immigration			2
we can not sustain the numbers coming in ; the strains on our infrastructure are enormous			0
control should be done fairly and the points system like they have in @entity89 and all those coming here should be encouraged to speak @entity92 so they can integrate			0
’ she adds : ‘ i just want to send the lot back but i ca n’t say that			0
’ confronted over the video in december last year , mrs @entity6 told the @entity97 her comments were taken ‘ out of context ’ and she was only referring to illegal immigrants			1
he said : ‘ it is nothing different from what the home secretary is advocating now any way			0
and the blackmail music is from a @entity110 sketch			0
i do n’t think there is anything there that can be seen as offensive or politically incorrect			0
’ ‘ i stand by what i said : illegal immigrants should be sent back home and multiculturalism wo n’t work			2
it was a throwaway comment that has been taken out of context			0
’ speaking after her selection this week , she repeated her warnings about immigration			2
‘ immigration is not a racist issue , it 's about sheer numbers , ’ she told the @entity122			2
‘ this country can not cope			0
it does n't matter about country or origin , it is about uncontrolled immigration , which is putting a huge strain on our infrastructure and pushing our schools and hospitals to breaking point			0
’ despite being backed by the local party , a @entity1 spokesman said : ' all candidates must be approved by the @entity140 and she has not yet been approved			2

@entity6 , who defected from the @entity27 , to stand in @entity74
contested the seat for the conservatives in 2010 before joining @entity1
@entity146 emerged last year in which she discussed immigration
*insists* she stands by remarks , *including* *declaring* ' multiculturalism is dead '
