music fans know what they really , really want when it comes to a catchy tune – and it ’s @entity5 , by the @entity6			1
the group ’s debut hit was named the catchiest @entity10 single in an online experiment involving over 12,000 people			1
despite being released 18 years ago , participants recognised the song in just 2.3 seconds , compared to an average of five seconds for other pop tunes			2
' @entity5 ' by the @entity6 ( pictured ) has been named the catchiest @entity10 single in an online experiment involving over 12,000 people , which set out to examine what makes a song memorable the experiment revolved around an online game called @entity22			1
it was developed by the @entity24 ( @entity25 ) and formed part of a study examining what makes a song memorable			1
in it , players were asked to identify a song as quickly as possible , from 1,000 clips dating from the 1940s to the present day			0
@entity5 took an average of 2.29 seconds for a participant to recognise its catchiest hook , which is ‘ if you wan na be my lover ’ and occurs 45 seconds into the track			2
@entity43 ’s @entity42 and @entity45 ’s @entity44 , were named the second and third catchiest tunes and were recognised in an average of 2.48 seconds and 2.62 seconds respectively , it was revealed at the @entity48			1
this video shows the top 10 catchiest songs , as recognised in the online experiment			2
in it , players were asked to identify a song as quickly as possible , from 1,000 clips dating from the 1940s to the present day the average time it took for participants to recognise a song across all the best - selling clips was just five seconds			2
the study suggests that spending weeks at number one or selling ‘ double platinum ’ does n't mean a tune will be catchy in the long - term			0
scientists think a catchy song has to strike a balance between prominent hooks and other musical features			2
@entity73 , a computational musicologist from the @entity74 , @entity75 who led the study , explained : ‘ all of the tracks we examined are among the best - known pop tracks in the @entity10 , and none of them showed extreme differences in recognisability between their hooks and their least - catchy moments : no more than 30 per cent of what would theoretically be possible			0
‘ but given that constraint , the catchiest songs also showed the greatest differences in recognisability between their hooks and their verses or bridges			0
’ dr @entity73 is fascinated by how the brain processes music and why some tunes are more memorable than others			0
having analysed how memorable segments of the songs are , he will now look at the precise music devices that make them so catchy			0
‘ although this is just a casual observation on my part , very strong melodic hooks seem to be the most memorable for people , ’ he told the @entity101			1
the game will remain online and can be played until the end of this year			0
dr @entity73 hopes that from it , scientists may gain a better understanding of how musical memory works , which could one day be used to help people with dementia			1
‘ there has already been some research that shows that if you can find the right piece of music , something that had a very strong meaning , playing that piece of music can be very therapeutic			0
but the challenge is figuring out what is the best piece of music , ’ he said			0
@entity43 ’s @entity42 ( artwork from the single is shown ) and @entity45 ’s @entity44 , were named the second and third catchiest tunes and were recognised in an average of 2.48 seconds and 2.62 seconds respectively , it was revealed at the @entity48			1
