by @entity0 a council has finally apologised over the way it handled a decision to remove three @entity5 children from foster parents who were members of @entity7			1
@entity8 maintained that the removal of the siblings last november was in their ' best interests '			2
but it also said membership of the @entity14 @entity7 was not a valid reason to take foster children from their carers and the issue was badly communicated			1
u-turn : @entity20 , @entity21 's head of children 's services , said in november that social workers had been right to remove three children from the care of their @entity7 member foster parents , but now the council has admitted that party membership was not a valid reason to take action in a statement , the local authority said a detailed review had found that the action to remove the brother and sisters was in their best interests			1
it added : ' however , we accept the impression left following media interviews on the morning of november 24 was that the removal of the children was solely because of the foster carers ' membership of @entity7 and the council apologises for this			1
' as this is a child care case , legal reasons continue to prevent us from releasing further details			0
however , we know that there are important lessons the council must learn			0
' as a consequence , the council has taken action to strengthen the way it makes decisions , communicates and shares information			0
' the children , a baby girl , a boy and an older girl , were removed by social workers after the council reportedly received an anonymous tip - off about the foster parents ' membership of the right - wing party			1
social workers reportedly said they were concerned about the children 's ' cultural and ethnic needs '			1
standing by its decision : @entity8 ( above ) maintained that the removal of the siblings was in their ' best interests ' the head of children ’s services in @entity8 defended the decision , saying that their affiliation to @entity7 meant they opposed ‘ multiculturalism			1
’ @entity20 , @entity21 ’s director of children and young people ’s services , said the children ’s ‘ cultural and ethnic needs ’ did not fit with the parent ’s ‘ strong views			0
’ but in today 's statement , @entity8 council clarified its position on party membership			2
' the council can confirm that membership of @entity7 would not prevent any individual from being considered as a foster carer in @entity8 and could not be a reason for removing foster children from a placement , ' it said			1
in november , the couple , a qualified nursery nurse and a former @entity100 reservist , were backed by education secretary @entity101			0
mr @entity101 said social workers had made ' the wrong decision in the wrong way for the wrong reasons '			2
in defence of the foster parents : education secretary @entity101 said in november that social workers had made ' the wrong decision in the wrong way for the wrong reasons ' he pledged to personally investigate the case , adding : ' @entity8 's reasons for denying this family the chance to foster are indefensible			1
' the birth parents of the three children were later revealed to be a @entity116 couple who have had six of their offspring taken away by social workers			2
the father accused council staff of ' racism ' and of destroying his family as he told how 20 police officers ‘ raided ’ their home to remove their last four children			0
he claimed social workers picked on the family because they are @entity130 and disapproved of their @entity132 ' lifestyle '			2
as reported in the @entity135 in december , the @entity134 father told friends : ' it is the social services who have been racist against my family			0
' the foster parents said they were planning legal action after their foster agency said the council had accused them of leaking information to the press about the children and their birth parents			0
they told the @entity150 in december : ' if @entity8 are accusing us of a breach of confidentiality and do not issue a formal apology in order to clear our name we may be forced to seek legal action to protect our future as foster parents			0
' @entity7 today said it did not wish to comment on the council 's statement .			0

social workers took three @entity5 children away in november
@entity8 council *originally* said couple 's affiliation with right - wing *group* meant they opposed ' multiculturalism '
it has now back - tracked saying reason for action was badly communicated
' the council can confirm that membership of @entity7 would not prevent any individual from being considered as a foster carer '
but council *insists* decision was still in the children 's ' best interests '
