by @entity1 reporter published : 10:58 est , 7 may 2012 updated : 01:40 est , 8 may 2012 @entity3 co-founder and former @entity5 roommate , @entity6 , is by many accounts the world 's youngest self - made billionaire			1
but as @entity3 's long - awaited may 18 share floatation approaches , the 27 - year - old is n't sipping champagne in the @entity12			0
instead he is in the mist of throwing himself back into @entity16 's start - up mix , even as the looming @entity17 seems likely to send his wealth spiraling even higher			2
@entity6 and his friend @entity19 , a @entity20 himself worth $ 150 million , head a company called @entity23 which employees 24 staff and is run out of inconspicuous @entity27 offices , where it just launched the first paid version of its online project management service			1
' when we think of work , we think of work as an act of service , as an act of love for humanity , ' said @entity19 , 28 , in a recent interview			1
added @entity6 : ' if we were just retired , we would n't be serving anyone			1
' like @entity5 , reportedly worth $ 17.5 billion and rarely seen out of a hoodie , they seem uninterested in the flash and status - hoarding that great wealth makes @entity53 do n’t have an entourage , sit among their staff in the office , and prefer to dress down			1
casual : @entity6 prefers to dress - down and sits among his employees in the office on the streets of their neighborhood , which brims with twenty - something hipster geeks , they 'd blend right in			1
what sets them apart , they acknowledge , is their absolute freedom to pursue their particular vision of how to change the world			0
and they seem to have no doubt that their software will do just that			0
after all , as some of @entity3 's earliest engineers , they 've seen their code change the world once already			0
@entity6 spent two years at @entity81 where he helped @entity5 start the site before they dropped out and moved to @entity84			1
he left @entity3 in 2008 and started @entity23 with @entity19			0
like other similar products , their software lets users set up web - based to - do lists that any group focused on a common goal can use to assign jobs and keep track of what gets done			0
the pair believe @entity23 will win out on its speed , versatility and ability to maintain the flow alluded to in its name , which in yoga refers to the poses meant to aid the flow of spiritual energy in the body			0
regular yoga sessions are among the perks of office life at @entity23			2
other benefits include an in - house chef and $ 10,000 for new hires to set up their desks with whatever computing gear they want			0
several marquee tech companies have embraced @entity23 , the company reports , such as @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			2
individual backers betting on @entity23 include venture capital celebrities like @entity120 and @entity121 , as well as several of @entity3 's earliest employees			2
@entity6 holds nearly 134 million shares of @entity3 stock , giving him a 7.6 per cent stake in the company			1
his net worth stands at more than $ 4 billion but like many of the richest @entity129 , @entity6 has signed a pledge initiated by @entity131 and @entity132 and @entity133 to give away most of his money			1
his wife runs his philanthropic foundation , which is still getting off the ground			0
contrary to @entity6 ’s modest lifestyle , fellow @entity3 investor @entity34 and his estimated $ 2billion fortune have been living it up in @entity142 , where he has become notorious for his playboy lifestyle			1
he regularly buys bottles of @entity146 champagne and @entity147 at the most exclusive clubs in the company of the super-rich , drives a @entity151 and lives in a penthouse in one of the city 's wealthiest neighborhoods			1
blogs have sprung up tracking his partying with many locals hoping to get close to the self - made billionaire			2
the @entity160 : @entity34 was played by @entity161 ( left ) and @entity6 by @entity162 ( centre ) with @entity5 played by @entity164 ( right ) according to @entity165 , @entity34 is a fan of hanging out at @entity142 's only private members club filter in the @entity167			1
investment : @entity169 has invested in a start - up cosmetics company run by @entity171 , former @entity172 2009 , to whom he also offers his business expertise the whirlwind of parties , adoring friends and fast cars seems to have left little time for business apart from @entity169 's investment in @entity183 - a start - up cosmetics company run by @entity171 , former @entity185 whom @entity34 also mentors			1
during a launch for the brand at a rooftop party , @entity34 said : ' with a company like @entity3 , it 's not just three people deciding how the world communicates , it 's really about providing a tool so your customers can be themselves			1
' he added : ' i think it really inspired me to see that she [ @entity171 ] went from miss @entity142 to pushing her line , that she 's going with her passion			2
' he has also ploughed money into information site @entity205 and online payment service @entity207			0
the @entity3 share flotation is expected to happen on friday , may 18 , with @entity5 planning to start the ' roadshow ' preceding the initial public offering ( @entity17 ) on monday			1
the social network , now eight years old , has 900million members and was valued at up to $ 79.3 billion			0
it is one of the most anticipated - and potentially the world 's biggest - stock market entry of an internet company since @entity219 floated in 2004			0
@entity5 , @entity169 and the original start - up facebook team including @entity6 , @entity221 and @entity222 were immortalised in the 2010 film @entity223			1
@entity34 was played by @entity161 and is portrayed as a slightly naive player in the game			2
@entity6 was played by @entity162			2
one thing @entity169 does prize highly is his privacy and closely guards details of his life			0
he attends few of the many public events he is invited to speak at and endorse and rarely gives interviews			0
it is presumably why he chose to set up home in @entity142 which has relatively few tabloids and paparazzi who follow the rich and famous compared to the @entity129 and @entity238			0
party time : @entity169 ( second right ) drinking champagne in @entity142 where he has become renowned for his lavish lifestyle of fast cars and nightclubs high class hang - out : @entity246 , the only private members club in @entity142 at the @entity167 , is said to be one of the @entity252 playboy 's favourite night spots those who wish to speak to him on a business level must try to make contact through an intricate network of society contacts and similarly rich friends			1
@entity260 , ceo of @entity142 - based start - ups dropmysite.com and @entity262 told the @entity263 : ' @entity34 does n't invest in much			2

@entity281 's apart : @entity5 in his habitual hoodie talking to @entity286 's @entity285 's earlier this from @entity3 headquarters in @entity288 , @entity289			2

@entity6 likes to dress down and sits among his employees in a modest office
he said he continues to work despite his wealth because of a love for humanity

he rarely invests in companies but had given *undisclosed* sum to former @entity172 to fund her own cosmetics line
