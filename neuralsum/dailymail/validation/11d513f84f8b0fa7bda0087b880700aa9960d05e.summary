rating : this is going to be special , i tell myself as we pass medieval @entity3 , lit up to dramatic effect , with the pretty village church glowing next to it			1
certainly , the @entity6 , near @entity7 , had looked cheering on the website - a village pub given a good wash and brush up without losing its charm			1
not much good for a weekend of any sort : the @entity6 is in tired and in real need of a makeover the whole place seems in the grip of a collective lethargy			1
i 'm not even given much in the way of a welcome			1
' do n't worry , this is n't rubbish , ' says the weary young woman who shows me to a room on the first floor above the kitchen extractor - even though only two other people are staying			1
she is not referring to the room , but to the eight bulging black plastic bin bags - ' it 's just sheets and stuff			2
' you might think sheets and stuff could be stored elsewhere			2
but then , on seeing my drab room , i have my doubts			2
it 's a charmless affair			2
the window frame has been painted recently , but no one has bothered to scrape off the drips stuck to the panes ; three dull watercolours hang on the walls ; the small desk is battered and bruised ; and the bedside lights are those infuriating ones that only come on when you tap them			2
even the laminated card telling you how to get an outside line is creased and uninviting			0
things are more convivial downstairs			0
the panelled bar , with its saddles on the walls , open fires ( not lit ) and exposed timber beams provide some atmosphere , but the best part is the dining room up a short flight of stairs , with its mish - mash of tables and chairs , some of which are lovely antique jobs			1
a mere three tables are occupied , but the wait between my indifferent first course ( two tiny bits of rolled - up smoked salmon and some avocado mousse ) and my main course ( sea bass in an overly rich sauce with gnocchi ) is unforgivable			1
' any veg ? ' i ask			0
' @entity81 , that 's about it , ' says the waitress in a would n't - bother sort of way			0
' i 'll have some kale , then , please			0
' it 's a wednesday night , but feels like the butt end of a sunday			1
i almost long for someone to ask if ' everything 's all right with your meal ' if only because it would mean i can ask for another glass of wine			0
i get talking in the morning to the ' sheets and stuff ' member of staff , and i like her no - nonsense honesty			0
' been busy ? ' i ask			0
' not really , bit dead actually			0
' ' who comes here at this time of year ? ' ' we get a lot down for a dirty weekend			0
' perhaps if you 're down for a dirty weekend you can forgive certain flaws			0
but calling this old boozer a hotel is a liberty too far			1
the @entity6 @entity108 @entity3 @entity109 @entity110 01892 871 617 @entity111 doubles from Â£ 119 b&b rating :			1

the @entity6 is one of the main *options* in pretty @entity3
however , this little retreat feels less like a hotel , more a *converted* pub
the *restaurant* has exposed timber beams but an *uninspiring* menu
