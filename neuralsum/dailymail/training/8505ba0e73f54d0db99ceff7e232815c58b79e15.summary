by @entity0 published : 06:11 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 11 october 2013 many people agonise over how to get a better night 's sleep , but now scientists believe they have come up with a formula that simplifies the problem			1
researchers have come up with the formula by considering a person ’s tiredness , bedtime , mattress comfort , their number of waking hours , noise , light , heat , and duvet thickness			1
the formula scores the person ’s sleep quality from ‘ great ’ to ‘ tossing and turning all night ’			1
researchers have come up with a formula by considering a person 's tiredness , bedtime , mattress comfort , their number of waking hours , noise , light , heat , and duvet thickness the researchers hope it will also help people work out what they need to do get to sleep quicker , and to stay asleep for longer			1
the formula , developed by the @entity35 in association with the @entity37 is - sleep quality = [ ( @entity41 x @entity39 ) + c ] / [ @entity42 + s + l + ( h x @entity43 ) ] a score of two is a great night ’s sleep , one is average and zero is tossing and turning all night			1
the ‘ t ’ stands for tiredness and is calculated by working out the number of hours since your last overnight sleep , minus the number of hours spent napping , plus the hours of physical exercise undertaken during the day			2
‘ @entity39 ’ means bedtime and is calculated by taking a person ’s bedtime that night and dividing it by their normal bedtime			1
‘ c ’ stands for comfort and is calculated as pillow , plus bedding , plus mattress , minus nine			0
scores for each item of bedding are worked out by rating them from one ( very uncomfortable ) to five ( very comfortable )			2
‘ @entity42 ’ stands for the average hours awake - this is how long you spend awake on an average day			1
for most people it will be about 16 hours			2
‘ s ’ represents sound and includes any sounds except white noise or soothing sounds you ’ve found to lull you to sleep			2
it is rated from one ( very soft sounds ) to five ( very loud irregular disturbing sounds )			0
the researchers hope the formula will help people work out what they need to do get to sleep quicker , and to stay asleep for longer ‘ l ’ is light and includes any light in the room , including illuminated clocks , natural lights and @entity89 ( where 0.1 is very soft light and 2 is very bright blue spectrum light )			1
‘ @entity97 ’ represents heat and is calculated by working out the number of degrees different from 16 to 17 celsius the temperature is , and then dividing it by ten			0
‘ @entity104 ’ stands for duvet appropriateness for room temperature - a good duvet can help us to maintain a comfortable body temperature while we sleep even if the room is a bit too warm or too cold			2
if it is highly breathable it can also prevent moisture from accumulating			0
@entity108 appropriateness is determined by a self - rating from zero ( compensates perfectly for room temperature ) to three ( does not compensate well and leaves you far too hot or too cold )			0
dr @entity112 who runs the @entity35 ’s sleep lab said : ‘ it is always fun to try and boil down a very complicated process into something really simple , and that is what we have attempted with this equation			2
‘ we wanted to keep things easy , but sleep is complex and there are lots of factors that we have n’t included , for instance the psychology of how you feel about the room you sleep in			2
‘ also , the extent to which the things we have put in influence sleep varies hugely from person to person , so this equation really should be viewed as a guide that may make people think about some simple ways they might be able to improve their sleep			1
’ her suggestions for a good night ’s sleep include keeping a regular bedtime schedule - so your bedtime and get up time are about the same every day , avoiding napping , and getting plenty of exercise			1
other key variables are heat , sound and light dr @entity153 suggest people make sure their room is cool - about 16 to 17 degrees @entity157 - and that their duvet is breathable to keep their body at the right temperature without allowing moisture to accumulate			2
she also suggests people keep their room as dark and as quiet as possible throughout the night			1
finally , she says comfort is very important to sleep quality so recommends people make sure all their bedding is comfy			1
the formula is - sleep quality = [ ( @entity41 x @entity39 ) + c ] / [ @entity42 + s + l + ( h x @entity43 ) ] a score of 2 is a great night ’s sleep , 1 is average and 0 is tossing and turning all night			1

the formula is : sleep quality = [ ( @entity41 x @entity39 ) + c ] / [ @entity42 + s + l + ( h x @entity43 ) ]
it scores sleep quality from ' great ' to ' tossing and turning all night '
the researchers hope it will also help people work out what they need to do get to sleep quicker , and to stay asleep for longer
