by @entity0 published : 21:22 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 21:22 est , 16 july 2013 shouting : @entity1 is a powerful actor and he does look passably like the real @entity2 director @entity3 reduces to silliness a rather simplistic play about the politics of @entity6 in its first years after independence from @entity8 in 1960			1
@entity1 stars as the republic ’s first prime minister , @entity2			1
mr @entity1 is a powerful actor and he does look passably like the real @entity2			1
but need he shout so much ? could he not give us a more nuanced idea of the cunning any nascent democrat must possess ? @entity15 plays @entity16 , the one - time acolyte of @entity2 who became his colonel – and his nemesis			1
we see little subtlety here , none of the coldness or charisma the real @entity16 must have had			1
the political power games throughout this play are feebly under - explored			1
there is something dismayingly naive about it – freshman student direction at best			1
@entity28 , the short - lived secretary general of the @entity29 , is played by a black actor in a ridiculous blond wig			2
he is accompanied by a couple of dolly birds who could be air hostesses from a sexist @entity36 comedy			2
@entity28 was , for some , a brave challenger of western imperialism , for others a misguided and duplicitous liberal			2
hands up : a season in the @entity6 by @entity41 stars @entity1 as @entity2 at the @entity42 when i was a correspondent in @entity45 in 1990 his name was still controversial			1
why cartoon a figure who was so key to post-colonial @entity50 leaders ? why do we have @entity53 - style puppets playing a chorus from a gallery ? at another point , toy parachutists float down from on high , to represent a @entity8 re-invasion			2
@entity60 evacuees are shown by tiny , @entity62 - style figures being pulled across the stage			0
the @entity65 and @entity66 ambassadors are done as jokes , which they most palpably were not			0
colour - blind casting is wilfully self - destructive here , failing to seize a chance to accentuate the arrogance of the white powers they are also played by black actors			0
why ? colour - blind casting is wilfully self - destructive here , failing to seize a chance to accentuate the arrogance of the white powers			0
there was also a puppeted vulture			0
do n’t ask me what it was meant to represent			0
the final touch : a windbag witch doctor who keeps jibbering away in some @entity50 tongue			0
i hope it is not giving away too much if i say that he is shot at the end			0
@entity90 ! it was the one moment in a long , boring night that i felt like cheering .			0
