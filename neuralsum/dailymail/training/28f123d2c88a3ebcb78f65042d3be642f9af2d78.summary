by @entity0 @entity1 : 07:41 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 07:44 est , 30 december 2013 a blind schoolgirl whose growth has been stunted by a rare condition can now get around thanks to a specially made mini cane			1
at just 34 inches tall , five - year - old @entity8 struggled to get by using even the smallest of white sticks because they were too big for her			1
but her life has now been transformed thanks to the custom - made cane			1
@entity8 , five , had @entity16 syndrome which causes short stature and infertility			1
she also has a brain tumour which caused her to lose her sight when she was two years old @entity8 has @entity16 syndrome – a chromosomal abnormality which only affects girls and is caused by an abnormal sex chromosome			1
she is also blind as a result of suffering from a brain tumour which damaged the nerves in her eyes			1
@entity8 , from @entity30 upon @entity31 , @entity32 , is one of just three known people in the world to suffer from the combination of @entity16 syndrome and a brain tumour			1
but she is adapting to life with her new 24 inch cane and started school in september			2
her mother @entity41 , 25 , said : ‘ most people moan if they have a headache and are struggling to get out of bed			0
but whatever she is faced with , she gets on with			0
‘ she ’s happy and smiley and full of energy			0
she ’s always caring about everybody else			0
@entity8 ( pictured with her mother , @entity41 , and her mother 's partner , @entity50 ) was unable to have an off - the - shelf white cane as they are too long so a custom - made one was flown over from @entity55 for her ‘ you hope for the best and i just take every day as it comes			1
the tumour has n’t grown back since her treatment			2
’ ms @entity8 , a mother - of - three , said : ‘ she had a cane which was the smallest they had in the country , but it was still too big for her and that did n’t even have the ball on it			1
‘ i had to get this one with the ball made for her in @entity55			2
since then , she has never looked back			0
‘ she uses it at school and she has grown with it really well			0
‘ she got it when she was four - she was the smallest in the country to have a white cane			1
@entity8 ( pictured learning to swim with her aunt , @entity76 ) is one of just three people in the world known to suffer from both @entity16 syndrome and a brain tumour ‘ i think now the blindness is part of @entity84			1
i would love her to wake up and say i can see but it is absolutely part of @entity8			2
‘ she has adapted to it so well			0
she does n’t let her it get her down and she has lots of friends at school			0
she will talk to anybody			0
’ @entity8 was diagnosed with @entity16 syndrome at her mother 's 15 week scan			1
the syndrome means she has part , or all , of one x chromosome missing			2
sufferers can experience a range of physical problems as a result , including small stature and infertility			2
she also developed a rare brain tumour , called craniopharyngioma , in 2010 and had to have keyhole surgery to reduce the size of it			1
but it was unsuccessful and in march 2011 she travelled to @entity110 to receive pioneering treatment			1
@entity8 ( pictured in hospital with her aunt , @entity113 ) had to have keyhole surgery to remove her brain tumour			1
when this failed , she went to the @entity110 for pioneering radiotherapy four metal screws were inserted into her head for six weeks while she underwent @entity120 , a form of radiotherapy suited to tumours buried deep in the brain and spine because it causes less damage to healthy tissue			1
the treatment involved gruelling sessions , five days a week for 45 minutes , while the tumour was zapped with radiation to reduce its size			2
however , the treatment caused her to suffer strokes			2
‘ she will need heart surgery because she has a narrowing of the aorta but that will probably be when she is about 10 years old , ’ ms @entity8 , who lives with partner @entity50 , 25 , added			1
‘ at the moment she is doing quite well with the tumour			2
‘ she has regular scans every three to four months to look out for her health and any potential problems			0
‘ she ’s on growth hormone and in the last six months she has grown six centimetres			0
’ ms @entity8 says she wants @entity8 to be independent and to feel she is no different to any other children @entity8 still has to undergo mri scans to look for tumour regrowth , as well as scans to monitor her blood vessels to prevent any potential strokes			1
one of @entity8 ’s doctors from @entity153 praised her bravery throughout her ordeal			2
@entity157 @entity156 , consultant paediatric oncologist at @entity153 , said : ‘ there are only three cases of the combined craniopharyngioma and @entity16 conditions reported in the world and @entity8 is one of those			1
‘ she has coped incredibly well			0
many young children cope better with blindness than adults as they do n’t know differently			0
‘ she has undergone three lots of surgery at the children ’s hospital in @entity171 , been to @entity110 and @entity172 as well			1
‘ she ’s a real star			0
she is incredible she recognises nearly all the staff that look after her just by the sound of their voices			0
’ @entity8 ( pictured with her sister , @entity178 ) will also need heart surgery when she is about ten as she has narrowing of her aorta ms @entity8 continued : ‘ i want her to succeed in everything that she does and to be happy			1
that is what any parent would want and to know that they have had a good childhood and to be at peace			0
‘ we try to give her independence			0
she understands that she is blind and she ca n’t see and she will say i can see with my hands and my cane can help me see where i am going			2
‘ in a way i am protective in that i am watchful but i let her do things herself to give her independence			0
i am trying to make her feel that she is not any different to the others			0
’ a spokesperson for @entity200 , the charity that made @entity8 ’s cane , said she has taken to using it naturally			1
they said : ‘ @entity8 , she was a natural , she took hold of the cane and off she went			2
i am sure the positive attitude of her family helped , but @entity8 is an inspiration			2
’ @entity16 syndrome affects about one in every 2,000 female babies and no cure is currently known			1
@entity16 syndrome is a genetic condition that only affects women			1
it is caused by an abnormal sex chromosome and affects about one in every 2,000 baby girls			2
babies normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes including one pair which determine the baby 's sex			0
these are known as the sex chromosomes			0
one sex chromosomes comes from the father and the other from the mother - the mother 's is always an x chromosome , the father 's can be an x or @entity235 a baby girl normally has xx and a boy has @entity239			0
in @entity16 syndrome , the @entity240 is missing so the child is always a girl			1
the child also has part , or all , of one x chromosome missing meaning she has just one complete x chromosome rather than two			0
most children with the condition are shorter than average and have underdeveloped ovaries			0
this means they are infertile and do not have periods			0
some girls with the condition also have heart , kidney and thyroid problems			0
@entity16 syndrome is often not diagnosed until puberty as height and the lack of periods are the main symptoms			1
there is no cure for the condition but most people with it live a relatively normal life and their life expectancy is unaffected			0

@entity8 was born with @entity16 syndrome - a chromosomal abnormality which only affects girls and causes short stature and infertility
when she was two she was also diagnosed with a brain tumour
the tumour caused her to lose her sight and meant she required surgery in the @entity281 as well as advanced radiotherapy treatment in the @entity110
she is only 34ins tall so is too short for an off - the - shelf white cane
she is now able to move around by herself thanks to a specially made cane
