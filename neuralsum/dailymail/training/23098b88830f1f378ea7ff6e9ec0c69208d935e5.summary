a financial whiz who combined a successful @entity3 career with raising her six children has blamed exhausted stay - at - home mothers who prefer to stay in at night for the failure of her first restaurant fund manager @entity9 says she had to close @entity10 's , her bistro in @entity12 , south west @entity13 , after 18 months because the area was ' full of mothers with children who do n't go out much at night '			1
the 53 - year - old multi-millionaire , who named the business after her eldest daughter who died of leukaemia in 1998 , says she was n't making a profit because the restaurant was n't doing enough trade at night			1
she also cited ' outrageous ' business rates in the smart suburb for the restaurant 's failure and blamed local estate agents for pushing them up			2
fund manager @entity9 , 53 , blames the closure of her @entity12 restaurant on ' mothers who do n't go out ' closed after 18 months : @entity9 named her restaurant after her eldest daughter , who died of leukaemia @entity9 said that while her cream - painted canteen did a roaring lunchtime trade , it was not doing enough covers in the evenings to make money			1
' i have learnt a lot of lessons , ' she said			0
' the problem is @entity12 if full of mothers with children who do n't go out much at night			1
' so although we were doing 200 lunches on a saturday and breaking even , i need to give a proper return to shareholders			0
' @entity9 is now planning to try again in nearby @entity49 , where - although it , too , is home to a large population of ' yummy mummies ' - she believes she has found more suitable premises			1
she intends to be open in time for @entity54 and says she has six chefs and six front - of - house staff already lined up			2
she launched @entity10 's after having the idea for it while sitting on her sick daughter 's bed discussing her favourite foods while she was being treated at @entity62 in 1998			1
' superwoman ' and her large family - this 1997 photo shows her with her nanny and children ( @entity68 ) @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity10 and @entity72			1
after @entity10 died she had another son , @entity73 when she launched it in spring 2012 , @entity9 said she intended to fill a hole in the market by offering good food at breakfast and lunchtimes , as well as dinner in the evenings			1
she told bighospitality.co.uk : ' there will be amazing homemade granolas and yogurts in the morning and then fantastic salads at lunchtime but a full service dinner in the evening			2
' a lot of restaurants in @entity13 do very , very little trade at lunchtime and do n't do any breakfast or teatime trade and that is actually rather a waste when costs are so incredibly high			2
' she added : ' i would n't do it unless i thought it was a good business proposition because there is no point otherwise			0
' ' full of mothers ' : @entity12 , with its pond and coffee shops , is a popular place for families in south west @entity13 @entity10 's was well - received by diners in @entity12 , who wrote enthusiastic reviews on the @entity113 website			1
' went here for dinner and the food was amazing ! ' , wrote one			0
' really liked the decor too , simplistic but stylish - would definitely return and try the brunch that i 've heard is yummy			0
' another wrote : ' a really good spot for a light , healthy lunch			0
' born in december 1960 to @entity124 and his @entity126 wife , @entity125 , @entity9 was educated at @entity127 and @entity128 before studying law at @entity130			0
in 1983 she joined @entity131 as a graduate trainee , and rose to director level before joining @entity134 nine years later			0
meanwhile , she had married financier @entity135 in 1984 , an old friend from @entity130 , and had her first child , @entity10 , in 1986			0
@entity9 brought the @entity138 to @entity134 , turning the company upside - down , dramatically increasing its profits , and earning herself £ 1.5million a year - a vast sum 16 years ago - for her work			2
role model : in the mid- 1990s , @entity9 appeared to be the working @entity3 mother who had it all when @entity134 sacked @entity9 , she flew to their @entity146 - with 40 journalists in tow - to ask why but it was in 1997 that she earned herself the ' @entity151 ' tag when , after being sacked from @entity134 , she summoned a pack of 40 journalists and flew with them to the company 's @entity146 offices to demand her job back			1
at 36 , she already had five children , one of whom was seriously ill , to cope with alongside her high - powered job , but the country was entranced by the supermother who would n't take no for an answer			0
ultimately , though , she did , and went off alone , setting up @entity165 in 1997 , the year before her daughter died of leukaemia , and then @entity167 in 2005			1
in 2005 @entity9 got divorced and met journalist @entity168 , when he came to interview her for the @entity170			0
she and @entity168 married the following year , and they live together in @entity12			0
after her first marriage ended in divorce , @entity9 found love with newspaper journalist @entity168 @entity9 's independent career appeared to be coasting when , in 2008 , she lost £ 12million of investors ' money to fraudster @entity178 and his @entity180 scam			2
since then , she has launched the @entity182 investment company , gone into film production with @entity185 films , and joined the board of an @entity188 trust			0
two months ago she announced plans to launch a crowdfunding venture , a website called @entity192 , in early 2014			2
@entity9 said the site would allow investors to make loans available to fledgling businesses , which would be repaid with a profit if the venture were a success .			1
