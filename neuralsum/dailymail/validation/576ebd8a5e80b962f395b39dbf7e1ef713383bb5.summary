nestled in the @entity2 countryside and protected by soundproof fencing , neighbours say it looks like a holiday park			0
but this £ 1.6million caravan site has been built by a council to provide a permanent home for just eight traveller families			1
the facility , @entity11 , is on the site of a previous unauthorised and run - down camp near @entity14			1
@entity14 's first permanent gipsy camp , which cost £ 1.6million to build , is due to open next month and contains eight permanent pitches the site contains eight permanent pitches and five which are designated ' transit ' sites for people who are just passing through the area each of the pitches have been built to house a utility unit , which contains washing facilities ( left ) and space for furniture ( right ) retired engineer @entity28 , 69 , said : ‘ it ’s a lot of money to lavish on people who travel around			1
it ’s like a holiday camp			0
’ another local said : ‘ do n’t think i ’ll bother paying to go to @entity33 or @entity34 any more ! ’ the site has five ‘ transit ’ pitches for short stays and eight permanent plots with a living room , sanitary facilities , a patio and parking for two caravans and two cars			1
because it is in the green belt , the units are clad in wood with grass roofs so they blend in			2
soundproof fencing will cut down noise from a nearby road and railway			0

@entity59 , 64 , has lived nearby for 25 years			0
he said : ‘ it is a vast improvement but the question is could it have been done cheaper ? ’ @entity11 has been developed on the site of an illegal encampment in @entity14 which had become run - down and full of rubbish the illegal site was full of discarded rubbish and gas canisters , and councillors hope the new development will give them more control each utility unit has been built in wood and have a roof which will be covered in grass to minimise the impact of the green belt development @entity77 , of the opposition @entity79 group on @entity14 , said : ‘ it ’s absolutely beautiful , however , is this the best use of taxpayers ’ money ? i ’m also not convinced this is the final figure			1
when we first had meetings around this , costs were estimated at over £ 2million			0
’ @entity91 chairman @entity90 said it was a lot to spend – and it would have been cheaper to let the travellers build their own housing			2
he said : ‘ the majority of new provision comes from the gipsy and traveller community itself , and because it is built by us and owned by us , it costs the council nothing and is generally better looked after			0
’ residents of @entity11 will pay £ 105 a week rent and £ 963.40 a year council tax , with 11 applicants hoping to move in next month			1
council leader @entity105 said having a dedicated gipsy site made it easier to clear illegal camps			2
the council is in the process of making £ 30million of cuts over three years			0
the utility unit for each pitch contains sinks , electricity points and running water , as well as room for kitchen equipment to be installed finishing touches are being made to fences and driveways for each of the pitches , to give the maximum possible facilities for families developers have been making the final finishing touches to the site , which is expected to open officially next month			1
