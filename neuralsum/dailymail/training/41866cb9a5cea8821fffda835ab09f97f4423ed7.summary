it was @entity0 ’s eighth goal inside a week and after the game he was asked if he was still happy at @entity3			1
he said : ‘ things are going well for more on a personal level the team is scoring goals , winning matches and playing well			0
’ asked about @entity20 ’s recent comments about the pair no longer having a relationship , he added : ‘ it ’s not for me to talk about things like that i ’m just concentrating on what we are doing on the pitch			0
’ @entity0 and @entity29 celebrate after the @entity30 scored his second in the 5 - 1 victory @entity10 forward @entity34 ( r ) scores a controversial penalty past @entity35 to open the scoring @entity29 wheels away in celebration after bringing @entity3 back on level terms at the @entity40 @entity0 scored in his 13th consecutive home game after another controversial penalty @entity0 sends a kiss to the @entity40 after completing his hat - trick from thepenalty spot			1

they will face far tougher opposition in the coming weeks but now , fully in their stride , they will fear no one			0
@entity0 even grabbed a late fourth goal from a @entity29 pass and that blossoming partnership is another reason for @entity3 supporters to be full of optimism			1
the highlight of the first half was a strange refereeing performance from @entity84			0
on 15 minutes he pointed to the spot when @entity0 looked to clear from inside the area and caught @entity109 unintentionally			2
@entity0 later admitted that it had been a penalty but both @entity3 and @entity10 players looked bemused			1
within minutes @entity84 had made another very strange decision this time in @entity3 ’s favour			2
@entity70 went down under a challenge from @entity46			0
it was debatable whether the challenge had been a foul but the contact from @entity46 that brought the @entity10 forward crashing to ground was inside the area			2
@entity120 gave a free - kick on the edge of the area that @entity10 wasted			2
@entity74 points to the sky after giving @entity10 a surprise lead from the penalty spot @entity29 equalised only four minutes later with a towering header from @entity129 's cross the former @entity131 winger issues his trademark ' heart - shaped hands ' goal celebration new signing @entity35 ( above ) makes an acrobatic save while @entity55 watched from the bench @entity138 vindicated as @entity0 scores four before the next bizarre penalty incident @entity3 were level with @entity29 heading in @entity129 ’ cross			1
it was his fifth goal in five games - aided by @entity79 ’s very flat dive			0
then came penalty number two with @entity84 pointing to the spot after minimal contact from @entity71 on @entity46 – again players from both sides looked bemused but @entity0 ’s penalty was unstoppable into the top right - hand corner			1
@entity3 extended their lead when @entity0 scored with another thundering header this time from a @entity29 cross			1
the home side were now in complete control and debutant keeper @entity35 was having less and less to do			0
in for the rested @entity55 who is expected to brought back into the side for the weekend ’s difficult trip to @entity160 , it was @entity162 first competitive match since the @entity163			0
@entity55 was still the centre of attention with cameras focused on the bench as he munched on an apple during the second half			0
he appears to be a dead man walking in @entity3 ’s battle of the goalkeepers with @entity162 unlikely to still be the number two next season			2
for now however the greatest keeper in @entity177 ’s history retains seniority and this start for @entity35 was seen as a reward for his patience			0
@entity0 hangs in the air before planting a bullet header into the bottom left cornerfor his second @entity0 strenghthened his reputation as one of the best headers in the game with a bullet second goal real defender @entity49 ( @entity192 ) has a headed effort on goal during the first - half @entity3 players celebrate with @entity0 en route to victory in front of their home fans @entity0 gets his fourth and final goal of the night after a break away in the dying minutes @entity3 toiled for the fourth goal and @entity0 came close with a shot drilled towards @entity79 ’s near post scrambled away by the keeper who then fumbled the resulting corner kick			1
@entity208 came on with ten minutes left replacing @entity129			0
the former @entity210 former had staked his claim for a place in the starting line - up with two goals against @entity90 last weekend but as if to show how difficult it will be for him to get into @entity5 ’s starting line - up , he was on the bench again despite the debut goals			0
@entity208 ’s appearance did bring a goal but it came from another former @entity210 player with @entity0 wining another slightly dubious penalty and thrashing it home for goal number four and hat - trick number 25			1
he and @entity29 had not finished and there was a late fourth for @entity0 – his eighth goal inside a week			2

@entity3 defeated @entity10 5 - 1 in their @entity231 clash at the @entity40
