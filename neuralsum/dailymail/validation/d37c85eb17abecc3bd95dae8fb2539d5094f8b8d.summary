a @entity0 and a half feet long moved into a @entity2 zoo yesterday			1
the @entity4 newest exhibit featured some of the nation 's largest living snakes to celebrate it 's new 48 foot , life - sized replica of the prehistoric @entity11 snake - the heaviest and longest snake ever discovered			1
though it might have looked tiny next to its ancestor , the zoo 's @entity14 python was no small thing , clocking in at 112 pounds			1
the currently unnamed female python is on loan to the zoo until september			1
a @entity14 python 13 and a half feet long made an appearance at the @entity4 newest exhibit yesterday that featured some of the nation 's largest living snakes guests could take pictures and touch the 112 pound reptile			1
the @entity14 python can reach more than 17 feet and weigh 400 pounds @entity31 , the zoo 's deputy director of animal care and conservation , told @entity35 that the snake was ' pretty large ' for a @entity14 python but that she had a ' great temperament '			1
' she 's a nice snake and she 's gorgeous and a pretty thing as can be , ' he said , adding that her relaxed mood will make her great for school visits			2
@entity31 said the python is fed frozen rabbits that are thawed out			0
the zoo 's snakes are never fed live food in order to protect their safety			1
' its much easier for quality control , ' he said			0
' and live food , even rabbits , can severely bite the face of a snake			0
they 're also trying to avoid being dinner			0
' a rock python , an anaconda and an eastern diamondback rattlesnake , the largest rattlesnake and the heaviest venomous snake in the @entity64 , have also moved into the exhibit			1
the @entity14 python is well - known in the state , where its hardly been harmless			2
a recent @entity69 and @entity70 study found that there are 150,000 pythons in the @entity73 , according to the @entity74			0
according to @entity31 , the leading theory is that the @entity14 python first came to the @entity76 in 1992 , after @entity77 blew through the state - and a pet breeding center			2
the exhibit was celebrating the zoo 's new 48 ft long , life - sized replica of the prehistoric @entity11 snake - the heaviest and longest snake ever discovered ' its believed either people could n't take care of them anymore , released them , or the hurricane destroyed the facilities and liberated the animals , ' @entity31 said			1
the @entity14 python has become what is known as an invasive species , wreaking havoc on the environment 's native species as they continue to spread			2
native to @entity99 , the python has quickly spread throughout the @entity76 as females can lay up to 100 eggs			0
the non-venomous snakes , who kill and eat their prey by constriction , have decimated the park 's mammal population , consuming more than 99 percent of raccoons and 88 percent of bobcats , according to the @entity74			2
although pythons can reach more than 17 feet in length and weigh up to 400 pounds , they are not a major threat to humans			0
instead they 'd rather feast on small mammals and birds , but are known to eat deers and alligators as well			0
an eastern diamondback rattlesnake featured in the @entity11 exhibit , the largest rattlesnake			1
unlike the @entity14 python , which kills its prey by constriction , this rattlesnake is venomous more than 2,000 pythons have been removed from the @entity76 since 2002 , according to the @entity127 @entity70			2
pythons captured in the park are typically euthanized			0
@entity31 said the zoo , which carries a rock python that was caught in the @entity76 , tries to provide homes for wild snakes if they can - but there often is n't the space to house such large animals			1
and the snakes are n't easy to find			0
the @entity70 said trapping methods are often ineffective , meaning the reptiles must be detected and removed by search and hand			0
the state even hosted the ' @entity143 ' , offering a reward to the team who captured and killed the most pythons in the month - long event			0
but for now , @entity31 said the zoo wants to celebrate snakes and their history			0
' we think of snakes as being positive members of the animal kingdom , ' he said			0
' we â€™re celebrating snakes by showcasing not only the big snakes living on the planet today but the biggest snake that ever existed			1
' a worker at the @entity2 zoo adds the eastern diamondback rattlesnake to the exhibit			1

the currently unnamed female python will be at the @entity4 until september
