the @entity2 's chances of sealing a staggering £ 10million - per - game agreement - and £ 5 billion overall - from the next three - year domestic rights deal are even stronger now two foreign tv giants are involved			1
the battle between @entity7 and @entity8 in the auction for the seven packages was already such that £ 10m for each of 168 live games was an achievable target			1
but the @entity2 also have @entity15 's massively - funded @entity14 looking closely at the tender document while @entity18 - based @entity17 are discussing whether to bid before the february 6 deadline			1
@entity2 matches could soon be sold for the equivalent for £ 10million per game in a new rights deal @entity24 , famous for their documentaries , look the more interested of the two potential new challengers			1
they own @entity29 so have an established platform on which to screen matches			0
even one of the two mini 14 - game packages might be seen as a way of establishing the @entity24 - @entity29 partnership in the @entity35			2
sports rights specialist @entity36 has been appointed @entity29 ceo to build content			0
as for @entity17 , they have the financial muscle to outbid all rivals and it seems a matter of when , rather than if , they will enter @entity46 's domestic football market			2
@entity48 executives say they will give serious consideration as to whether now is the right time to move			0
the competition will delight the @entity2 , who sell each of the seven packages to the highest bidder , and it might be that three different networks share content from 2016 - 17			2
@entity2 chief executive @entity58 will help arrange the next three - year broadcast deal the remarkable culling of the over- 50s at the @entity62 continues with the departure of communications chief @entity64			1
replacements already in the frame are 40 - somethings @entity67 — who survived the @entity70 debacle so well that @entity46 cricket chief @entity71 went to @entity72 to study the @entity74 pr operation — and @entity75 , the robotic former @entity7 spokesman who never went off @entity77 message in 20 years			2
@entity64 has left his role as the @entity62 's head of communications after nearly a decade the minutes of the last @entity83 protocol committee meeting show once again how this preposterous gathering seems far more interested in feeding their faces than discussing serious issues			1
the main topic at the meeting was about the @entity90 @entity83 delegation running slightly late before the friendly international last september , meaning the start of the vip - match meal in the @entity93 had to be delayed			0
@entity94 scores @entity46 's only goal from the penalty spot in a 1 - 0 win against @entity98 in september greedy blazers were so agitated about having to wait for their food that it was agreed that in future a member of the @entity83 's international relations team will be sent to the opposition 's hotel to ensure they set off for @entity93 on schedule			0
protocol members decided that from now on they will tuck in at the designated time even if their opposition guests have not yet arrived			0
this rush to the trough follows the full council actually taking a vote on whether dessert should be served before the match or at half - time — to the exasperation of @entity83 chairman @entity120			0
@entity121 , @entity122 's director of communications and marketing , arrived at @entity124 from @entity46 last september			0
four months later , he has still to communicate properly with specialist tennis writers despite the @entity122 's chronic need to improve media relations			0
@entity121 said he has had other priorities			0
it 's win - win for @entity130 all that needs to be said about the publicity stunt that is @entity130 's candidature for the @entity134 presidency is that the @entity135 is keeping his £ 250,000 fee from bookmakers @entity137 — who dreamed up the idea — irrespective of whether he gains the necessary support from five national associations by january 29			1
@entity130 will keep his £ 250,000 fee from @entity137 even if he fails in his bid to become @entity134 president the former @entity146 and @entity147 winger , who seemed more clued up about the 2018 @entity148 in @entity135 — having been on the bid team — admits his knowledge of @entity134 politics is slim			1
when asked at the @entity134 launch how many members of @entity154 he could name , he replied : ' that 's a good question , i need to know more about @entity134			2
@entity137 , bless ' em , insisted this was a genuine campaign but admitted it will be over in two weeks if @entity130 does not win the required nominations			1
@entity130 , all @entity161 charm , said nothing much relevant to unseating 78 - year - old @entity163 next may .			1

the @entity2 could make the equivalent of £ 10million per game
@entity7 and @entity8 are battling for rights in the next three - year deal
the @entity14 and @entity17 are considering bids too
@entity62 communications chief @entity64 has been let go
@entity130 will keep £ 250,000 fee from @entity137 even if his bid to become @entity134 president fails in the next two weeks
