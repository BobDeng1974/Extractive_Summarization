i have had an amazingly happy time since the last race in @entity3			1
it was there that @entity6 won the constructors ’ championship for the first time – a historic moment for everyone concerned			1
what that experience reinforced for me is just how much of a team sport @entity15 is			2
it is the championship that means most to all the people involved ; it is the one we all win together			2
i visited our two factories , @entity20 and @entity21 , and it was obvious how everyone felt the same sense of elation			1
the champagne was out and we sang , ‘ we are the champions , ’ which turned out to be a bit embarrassing for me when it went out on @entity30			0
you could n’t hear the rest of the team singing ; just my voice ! as some people said i should stick to the driving ! @entity37 ( left ) and @entity38 ( right ) pose for a selfie with hoardes of the @entity6 team @entity6 won the constructors ' championship after a fine result in @entity45 reminding @entity37 of the team effort the @entity48 driver walks in the paddock on thursday ahead of the @entity51 @entity50 this weekend @entity37 locked up going into the first corner in @entity3 , handing @entity38 the advantage ' there are great races with all eyes on the battle between @entity38 and me and we want to make it a great finale ' the next big party that is scheduled for the team is our ‘ @entity69 ’ event at the @entity6 museum in @entity66 at the end of the season			1
i went there when i was a @entity6 go - kart driver in 2000 , at the start of my career and now i will be back as part of a championship - winning team			1
that is awesome , but i also hope i will be there with a drivers ’ title under my belt , too			0
that brings us to this weekend ’s @entity82 in @entity83 – three races from the end of the season			1
i am 17 points behind @entity38 in the drivers ’ championship but there are 100 points available			1
i would prefer to be ahead , of course , but that is the way it is and there is everything to play for			2
i ’m feeling very good about the situation			1
i did n’t know how i would feel when it came down to the final few races – whether i would be nervous or whatever , but i am feeling fine , maybe even relaxed			1
it is an amazing opportunity			0
there are great races with all eyes on the battle between @entity38 and me and we want to make it a great finale			1
after going to the factory , i went to @entity108 for a few days			0
i did some training there – it was an opportunity to give the fitness levels a final boost			0
it is nearly impossible to ramp up the fitness during the season so that is what i was trying hard to do			0
then we did a private @entity118 with my family in the south of @entity121 – i was wearing the @entity123 outfit			0
after a day in the simulator in @entity20 i went to a driving event and did some passenger rides at the nurburgring for our partner @entity129 and then i came early to @entity83			2
i have been here since monday to make sure i get over the jet - lag 100 per cent			1
it is fantastic that @entity15 is racing in @entity83			2
the city is so cool , so different – their slogan is ‘ @entity136 ’ , after all			0
@entity137 , my wife , is with me and we have enjoyed our time here			2
on thursday i had the best burger in my entire life			1
i put it together myself because there are so many things i ca n’t have – onions , because they are among the hardest things to digest , and gluten			0
so i had gluten - free bread with @entity150 meat – they had @entity150 meat for some reason – with a fried egg on top with tomato and lettuce			2
that was not the end of the culinary experience , though			0
on wednesday , i went with the whole team to a steakhouse to celebrate the constructors ’ title – well deserved by the boys			1
every time we are here there is a debate about how much the impact the sport has on @entity51			0
my experience has been of many @entity51 coming up to me and saying they are following the @entity15			0
they say they are following me and urging me to keep it up			0
i get the feeling there is a lot of interest in @entity15 here			0
my best position at the @entity180 is ninth but i do n’t look at statistics like that			0
with the car i have everything is possible anywhere			0
my approach is to look forward to the next three races and to get the most out of them			1
@entity37 is 17 points behind @entity38 and will be hoping to make up ground in the race on sunday @entity37 enjoys the ' best burger of his entire life ' ( left ) and poses with @entity195 during the break a cyclist rides on the @entity15 track at @entity83 , with the famous stars and stripes visible			1

i *'ve* had an amazingly happy time since the last race in @entity3
@entity6 won the constructors ' championship for the first time
we have celebrated together and i have visited our two factories
it was obvious how everyone felt the same sense of elation
i may be 17 points behind @entity38 , but i *'m* feeling very good
anything can happen in the next few races , we can make it a great finale
there are 100 points to play for and it would be great to start well in @entity83
i had the best burger in my entire life on thursday , and celebrated with the team at a steakhouse on wednesday - well deserved !
i do *n't* look at stats , my approach is to look forward to the next three races
