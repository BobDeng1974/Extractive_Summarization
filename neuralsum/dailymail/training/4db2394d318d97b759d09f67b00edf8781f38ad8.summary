@entity0 are to spend just two and a half days a week in @entity1 after @entity2 told them they were not likely to be needed on thursdays			1
the government chief whip has informed @entity0 that there will be no major legislation on thursday afternoons for the foreseeable future			1
it means they will arrive in @entity8 on monday lunchtime and could leave on wednesday afternoons			2
the coalition has reached a logjam , with the @entity12 and @entity23 unable to agree on major new laws with six months until the election			2
this week saw the final stages of the @entity27 debated on monday and the @entity28 passed last night			0
but today the government has given @entity31 time to force a vote on the @entity33			0
tomorrow is given over to backbench business on ‘ money creation and society ’ and ‘ devolution and the union ’			0
mr @entity2 has sent an email to @entity12 mps making clear that in future all thursdays will be a one - line whip – meaning that are not required to attend			1
the @entity43 was almost empty during a debate on @entity45 on thursday november 6			0
the scene is likely to be repeated in the coming weeks @entity47 suffered a humiliating first defeat on a @entity50 bill today after more than 40 mps rebelled in a vote to help pubs buy cheaper beer			0
the government had opposed plans to make it easier for pubs to purchase drinks from different brewers , but ministers were left embarrassed after they failed to head - off the backbench rebellion			2
chief whip @entity2 faced shouts of ‘ resign ’ and ‘ well done , chief whip ’ , after 17 conservatives and 24 @entity23 voted against the @entity55 in its first legislative defeat since 2010			1
the rebellion was particularly embarrassing for @entity23 business minister @entity68 , who had spoken for the government during the debate , after the rebels included her husband @entity72			2
@entity73 , who was one of the ministers responsible for the bill , was reportedly seen ‘ grovelling ’ to the prime minister after the vote			0
some of the absent @entity0 are thought to have been campaigning ahead of the @entity78 and @entity79 by - election			1
departmental questions are held on thursday mornings , so some mps will be present			0
and others will be in @entity8 for thursday afternoon debates or meetings			0
but many will be able to return to their constituencies to work , and campaign for re-election in may next year			0
one @entity12 mp said : ‘ @entity2 was saying that thursdays are generally a one - line whip			1
he was emphasising as part of a bigger memo that they are likely to remain one - line whips			1
’ with no crunch votes to stay for , @entity31 and @entity23 @entity0 are also likely to depart from @entity8 to return home to campaign for votes			1
a @entity100 spokesman said : ' as advice to conservative mps made explicitly clear , if there is a three line whip then @entity0 will be required to be in parliament , just as has always been the case			1
' and just as has always been the case , if there is not a three line whip , they are free to choose whether to work in their constituencies instead			1
' despite running out of major legislation , the coalition will go on until may because of a law passed in 2010 creating fixed - term parliaments of five years			1
it was imposed to prevent the sudden collapse of the power - sharing deal between the @entity12 and @entity23			0
but critics say it means the government has run out of steam and will limp on for months			2
deputy pm @entity123 yesterday defended the move			0
he told @entity0 : ‘ we have legislated for a fixed - term parliament			1
‘ that is an important constitutional innovation			0
i personally think that coalition governments of different compositions are more likely in future			2
‘ that is why , among many other reasons , it is important that we do what we say and see through this @entity1 from end to end until may 2015			0

chief whip @entity2 tells @entity0 there will be no big votes on thursdays
only a ' one - line whip ' for the foreseeable future so they can leave early
coalition *deadlock* means there is no major legislation to debate
fixed - term parliament means government will limp on until may 2015
