by @entity0 @entity1 faces a fresh sexism row after the party 's treasurer claimed women are failing to progress in the boardroom because they are ' absolutely nowhere ' when it comes to competitive sports such as chess			1
@entity11 was accused of being sexist after suggesting in a debate that having more women was not necessarily an advantage			1
the @entity1 donor and treasurer said : ‘ i would just like to challenge the idea that it is necessarily right to have a lot of women or a particular number on a board			1
' controversy : betting tycoon @entity11 , the @entity1 treasurer , suggested women were not cut out for business because they lacked a sporting competitive streak the betting tycoon went on : ‘ business is very , very competitive and you should take the performance of women at another competitive area , which is sport where they have no strength advantage			1
' chess , bridge , poker - women come absolutely nowhere , and i think that just has to be borne in mind			1
’ the former @entity40 donor who switched to @entity1 was challenged by one of the panellists dr @entity43 , chair of the @entity44 , who said : ‘ i think that is such a disingenuous , sexist comment			1
’ she said her mother , who is 83 , was a chess champion in @entity48 for several years			2
mr @entity11 , 78 , father of @entity50 model @entity49 , added after the debate that he was not claiming women were less intelligent because they ' come out of the universities doing at least as well as men if not better '			1
but he told the @entity55 : ' yet when it comes to the highest levels of those competitive sports where all that matters is intellectual ability , and determination and perhaps stamina for some reason - and i do n't know what the reason is - they are nowhere			0
‘ i do n’t accept it is sexist , it simply rings true			2
it may be that women are not as competitive as men , although women do well in law , they are quite successful barristers ...			2
i was just saying it ’s interesting and i do n’t have an explanation			0
’ women make up 17 per cent of boards of @entity80 firms , and several of the top 100 companies do not have a single female board director			1
just three per cent of chief executive are women			2
one of the panelists at the debate at the @entity87 , was @entity1 mep @entity88 who caused a storm last week by claiming @entity91 ’s foreign aid goes to ‘ bongo bongo land ’			2
he said quotas for women in companies would come in @entity91 as a result of pressure from the @entity98 and said : ‘ we have to fight this tooth and nail ’ , saying the idea was ‘ totally patronising and archaic			1
’ outspoken : @entity1 mep @entity88 , who railed against foreign aid being sent to ' @entity103 ' , vowed to fight plans for women on company boards ' tooth and nail ' @entity1 blundered further when they launched a website in @entity109 calling themselves the ' @entity110 '			1
when trying to translate the party 's name into @entity109 they came up with ' @entity113			0
' @entity114 is the abbreviation for the @entity91 in @entity109 but ' du ' means black			0
a spokesman said : ' it 's a screw up , we have now rectified it ' and said it was not a re-branding of the party			0
its mep @entity88 has been under fire for saying @entity91 sends foreign aid to ' bongo bongo land ' - which he denied was racist or intended to be a derogatory reference to @entity128			0
@entity1 says it wants an end to ' mass , uncontrolled immigration ' including a five - year freeze on permanent settlement , and any future migration strictly limited to those who can ' clearly be shown to benefit the @entity91 people as a whole and our economy '			0
they would not allow immigrants to apply for public housing or benefits until they had paid tax for five years			0
in order to achieve these goals they say @entity91 would have to leave the @entity98 because there are no restrictions on other @entity98 citizens moving to the @entity91 while it remains a member			1
mr @entity88 claimed if anyone suffered prejudice it was actually men – saying in many walks of life women are promoted ‘ beyond their abilities ’			2
he said : ‘ if you worked certainly in the public sector or a reasonably large company who can smell which way the wind is blowing , you are far more likely to be advanced by being a woman in your quest for promotion than disadvantaged			0
‘ @entity170 [ @entity171 ] and i can give you personal stories about how that 's worked in the [ @entity175 ] commission where very , very highly qualified men have been jumped over to get a woman into a more senior position with nowhere near the qualifications			0
’ he also claimed that when he was in the army , before becoming a @entity183 pension fund manager , women were allowed to pass courses because examiners ‘ did n't have the bottle ’ to fail them			2
mr @entity88 has previously courted controversy by claiming that ‘ no self - respecting small businessman with a brain in the right place would ever employ a lady of child - bearing age ’			0
and he claimed many women do not want to be on the boards of companies as they make ‘ wiser ’ choices about their careers			1
those who want quotas , he said , ‘ sadly have no great confidence in their sisters and think women need special help			1
’ he has had several successful female bosses during his career , he said , saying : ‘ my ultimate boss of course was her majesty			2
i go home and i work for another one – mrs @entity210			0
i go up to my secretary ’s office and she tells me exactly what to do			0
’ mr @entity88 also joked that he and @entity171 , the @entity1 leader , had been trying and failing to be invited to one of @entity217 president @entity216 ’s infamous ‘ bunga bunga ’ parties ‘ for years ’			0
he said : ‘ we still hope that he somehow manages another term and he remembers us ’			0
dr @entity43 and fellow panelists including @entity223 , a former magazine editor and the founder of @entity225 and @entity227 ’s chocolate , argued that quotas were not the answer but the root causes of under - representation of women – such as flexible working hours , childcare costs and low aspirations among girls at school – could be tackled .			1
