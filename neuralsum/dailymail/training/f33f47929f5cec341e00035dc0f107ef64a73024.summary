@entity0 , 43 , escaped with just an injured shoulder when the @entity3 spacecraft broke apart mid-flight and crashed in the @entity5 desert investigators are trying to piece together how @entity8 's surviving pilot managed to escape the rocket as it disintegrated around him and parachute to the ground from an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen			1
@entity0 , 43 , sustained just an injured shoulder when the @entity3 spacecraft broke apart mid-flight and crashed in the @entity13 last friday , killing co-pilot @entity14 , 39			1
@entity15 , acting chairman for the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) that is leading the crash investigation , said mr @entity0 did not exit through the cockpit 's escape hatch			1
' we know it was n't through there , so how did this pilot get out ? ' he said			0
mr @entity0 is being treated in hospital and is yet to speak to investigators			1
it has also been revealed that a ' human - factors ' expert will join the investigation to study why the mr @entity14 prematurely unlocked a pivoting tail section of the ship during a test flight			1
the untimely engagement of the tail mechanism - designed to slow the vehicle 's descent into the atmosphere from space - have emerged as a main thrust of the inquiry into the crash			2
it raises the prospect of human error as a cause for the crash , though investigators say it is too early to make any firm determination			2
' we know already from having the lever move from lock to unlock that we need to get a human - factors person in here , ' said mr @entity15			2
' the question then is why did that happen when it happened ? ' investigators have yet to determine whether releasing the tail mechanism too early caused or contributed to the crash of the space plane near the @entity5 , about 95 miles north of @entity60			1
the suborbital rocket vehicle dubbed @entity8 broke into pieces shortly after it separated from the special jet plane that carries it aloft for its high - altitude launches			1
the crash , which unfolded without @entity8 catching fire or exploding in flames , came on its fourth powered test flight , the first since january			0
video footage from the cockpit shows mr @entity14 releasing a lever to unlock the twin - tail section eight seconds after @entity8 's engine ignited			1
@entity8 , developed by the fledgling space tourism company of billionaire entrepreneur @entity89 , was designed to carry wealthy passengers on short rides into space			0
@entity3 was planning to begin offering its first flights to paying customers next spring			0
mr @entity15 told a news conference that investigators had determined @entity8 's tail system was supposed to have been released for deployment as the craft was traveling about 1.4 times the speed of sound			2
these images show the @entity8 rocket separating from the carrier aircraft , left , and then disintegrating , right , during a test flight on friday instead , the tail section began pivoting when the vehicle was flying at @entity107 , the speed of sound			0
' i 'm not stating that this is the cause of the mishap			0
we have months and months of investigation to determine what the cause was , ' mr @entity15 said			0
asked if pilot error was a possible factor , mr @entity15 said : ' we are looking at all of these issues to determine what was the root cause of this mishap ... including that possibility			0
' also unclear was exactly how the tail mechanism began to rotate once it was unlocked , since that maneuver requires a separate pilot command that was never given , mr @entity15 said			0
this raised questions about whether the craft 's position in the air and its speed somehow enabled the tail section to swing free on its own			0
the spacecraft was supposed to ' feather ' when it reached its maximum altitude at 360,000ft but the device was launched early just seconds after detaching from the launch craft the untimely engagement of the tail mechanism - designed to slow the vehicle 's descent into the atmosphere from space - and the possibility that pilot error was to blame , have emerged as a main thrust of the inquiry			1

@entity0 , 43 , escaped from the spacecraft and parachuted to *safety*
he was at roughly *50,000* feet - an altitude virtually devoid of oxygen
investigators said mr @entity0 did not exit through the cockpit 's escape hatch
co-pilot @entity14 , 39 , was killed in the *disaster* over @entity5 desert
