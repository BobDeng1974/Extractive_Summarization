buying the wrong bombs , mislaying anti-aircraft missile systems and gifting @entity3 a property portfolio have led the @entity5 to rack up losses of £ 1.58 billion in the past two years , @entity0 can reveal			1
previously unseen accounts for 2012 - 13 show that the @entity5 has written off huge sums of taxpayers ’ money after an array of stores losses , accounting errors and what are categorised in the department ’s figures as ‘ fruitless payments ’			1
the wastage came at a time when the @entity20 was insisting that it needed to sack thousands of service personnel to balance the books			0
figures obtained by this newspaper reveal that in the last financial year the @entity5 ’s bookkeepers were apparently incapable of accounting for £ 33.6 million in funds allocated for military purposes			1
a note in the accounts describes a lack of information over the whereabouts of the money – leading to the ‘ write - off of unsupported balances ’			1
documents also show that while the @entity5 was axeing historic regiments and withdrawing iconic ships and aircraft from service , it was simultaneously giving to @entity42 a fleet of 50 @entity45 four - ton trucks worth £ 450,000 , and counter-terrorism training equipment to @entity47 worth £ 294,000			2
according to the accounts , the biggest giveaway of all in 2012 - 13 was handing back the barracks and buildings in @entity3 which had been in @entity53 possession			1
the documents state that this cost the @entity5 £ 1.5 billion in impairment charges			2
the figures also reveal that hundreds of troops benefited from a clerical error in the wages department			0
they were overpaid about £ 640,000 and there are no plans to recover the excess payments			0
similarly the @entity5 has written off £ 527,000 for missing anti-aircraft missile parts , £ 743,000 after the disappearance of lightweight field generators , £ 390,000 for lost kit in @entity69 and £ 277,000 for purchasing bombs which no longer suited their training requirements			2
among the so - called ‘ fruitless payments ’ is £ 1.6 million for towing @entity73 after the submarine ran aground off the @entity75 , and £ 393,000 paid to landowners and catering contractors following the late cancellation of military exercises			1
' fruitless payment ' : the @entity82 submarine @entity73 ... before it ran aground off the @entity75 , racking up costs of £ 1.6million defence sources stressed last night that such payments were inevitable given the requirement to change planning schedules due to unforeseen circumstances			1
the @entity5 accounts also include a list of payments categorised as ‘ claims waived or abandoned ’			2
among these is a £ 413,000 bill for security at a @entity96 , the £ 1.5 million overpayment of tax by the department to @entity100 and £ 417,000 to settle a dispute over computer services at the @entity103 in @entity104			0
waste : shadow defence secretary @entity106 condemned the @entity5 's ' multi-million pound mistakes ' last night , shadow defence secretary @entity106 said : ‘ this incompetent waste will come as a shock to a country angry at defence cuts			2
‘ multi-million pound mistakes come at a time of mass sackings of service personnel and defence equipment being scrapped			0
‘ people will wonder how the government can lose expensive items of equipment			0
ministers should minimise waste and prioritise protection for those who serve and their families			0
’ the @entity5 has also incurred several constructive losses over the last two financial years , though defence sources insist that these payments , such as the cancellation of the @entity130 intelligence gathering aircraft at £ 3.7 billion , the early withdrawal of the @entity133 aircraft at £ 1.2 billion and the retirement of five @entity82 vessels at £ 513,000 , will save money in the longer term			1
the @entity5 said : ‘ the figure of £ 1.5 billion in the accounts reflects the reduction in the value of the @entity3 estate as a result of the decision to withdraw @entity53 forces from @entity3 earlier than planned			1
this is not the cost of returning personnel and their families by 2019 , which will actually save the taxpayer £ 240 million per year			0
‘ the vast majority of write - offs are not items lost or wasted but occasions where we have sold off or scrapped redundant military equipment or gifted equipment to another country			0
‘ gifting to countries often prevents the @entity53 military having to get directly involved and thus saves the @entity53 taxpayer			0
‘ for the first time , the @entity5 has a balanced budget and the @entity162 have a fully funded ten - year @entity163 of some £ 160 billion			1

@entity5 could not account for £ *33.6million* allocated for military purposes
@entity0 reveals vast sums written off as ' unsupported balances '
wastage at time when defence services axed to ' save money '
costs include hand - back of @entity3 barracks at £ *1.5billion* and recovery of one submarine that ran aground at £ 1.6million
