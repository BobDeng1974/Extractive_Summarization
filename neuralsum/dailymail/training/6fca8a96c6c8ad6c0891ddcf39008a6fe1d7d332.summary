a @entity1 colleague watching @entity3 ’s most recent press conference on the internet found it amusingly familiar			1
he recognised the facial expression that said @entity8 ’s new manager was less than impressed with what he considered a challenge to his authority			1
not to mention a tactic he often employs when he does not want to answer a question			0
he simply dismisses it as a poor one and moves on			0
as @entity17 said after being asked if @entity19 ’s red card had made him doubt the wisdom of selecting the combustible @entity21 as his captain , it was his ‘ right ’ to offer no response			1
new @entity8 manager @entity3 does not suffer fools gladly during press conferences @entity17 's temper is reminiscent of the way in which sir @entity30 ruled at @entity31 @entity30 would often dish out contempt to questions he did n't agree with during press conferences sir @entity30 13 x @entity35 2 x @entity37 4 x @entity39 5 x @entity41 2 x @entity42 1 x @entity45 1 x @entity45 3 x @entity47 4 x @entity48 1 x @entity50 total : 36 major trophies @entity3 1 x @entity37 4 x @entity54 2 x @entity56 1 x @entity58 1 x @entity59 1 x @entity61 1 x @entity62 1 x @entity61 1 x @entity45 total : 13 major trophies and on a weekend when @entity66 demonstrated how destructive public criticism can be in a team environment , the @entity1 did himself no harm by displaying the kind of unity on which success at @entity31 has long been built			1
if he was unhappy with @entity19 for getting himself suspended for three matches in what promises to be a tough few weeks for a misfiring @entity8 side , he expressed that view in private			1
for what it ’s worth , @entity17 actually missed the point when it came to that particular enquiry about @entity19			1
sometimes questions need to be asked in anticipation of a wider response and the days of debate that have followed @entity19 ’s dismissal for kicking @entity85 prove the point			1
some of it has been hysterical , some of it rather surprising			0
some of his fiercest critics have suddenly become his most vocal allies , pointing to the fact that three years had passed since @entity19 ’s last red card			1
but a red card only six games into his captaincy at @entity8 is a statistic that at least raises concern that the burden of responsibility might occasionally become too much for a player of @entity19 ’s volatile nature			1
that does not mean that @entity19 is not the right man to lead @entity8 in these challenging times , particularly at a football club where the captain has often been an extension of a combative manager			1
there was a time when the same heart appeared to beat inside sir @entity30 and @entity116 , even if @entity30 would now deny it and @entity116 will no doubt do the same when his new autobiography goes on sale next week			1
@entity19 was sent off for kicking out at @entity120 's @entity85 at @entity31 last weekend the decision to hand @entity19 the captain 's armband has been scrutinised over the last week @entity17 , however , brushed off questions surrounding his choice when asked on saturday the relationship between @entity17 and @entity19 is similar to that of @entity30 and @entity116 @entity17 clearly sees something of himself in @entity19			1
it will be why he chose him			0
and while @entity19 ’s professional relationship with @entity30 might have ended much like @entity116 ’s , he might see something of his former manager that he admires in @entity134 , too			1
that press conference on saturday certainly reminded me of @entity30 , even if it lacked the sheer explosiveness of some of @entity30 ’s more memorable encounters with the media			1
what made @entity30 so fascinating , in particular for the reporters whose job it was to see him ahead of every match , was his unpredictability			1
other times grumpy and disinterested			0
he might surprise you by suddenly appearing friendly ; funny even			0
and then there were those moments when he could descend into a blind rage with venomous , personal attacks			0
on one particular morning he concluded his answer to the last question by telling the assembled reporters to ‘ go away and write ’ their ‘ s * * * e ’			0
those who were there still laugh about it to this day			0
the @entity1 journalists recall similar tales of @entity17 , even if many of them have found him difficult to warm to over the years			1
in certain cases relationships have been eroded by the tone of the confrontation			0
not because he might declare a question unworthy of a response but because of the way he then goes on the attack			0
he might inform a reporter that their opinion lacks credibility because they have not had the benefit of attending his training sessions all week			0
@entity30 addresses the media ahead of the 2009 @entity37 final against @entity179 he might even point to the fact that they have never played the game professionally - an argument that jars with every football fan - and therefore are not entitled to doubt him			2
‘ he can be funny , too , ’ said my @entity1 colleague earlier this week			2
‘ but he sometimes enjoys trying to ridicule you in front of your colleagues			0
’ at the @entity192 in @entity193 last summer certain reporters felt @entity17 was too controlling			2
he had an excellent tournament where it mattered most , of course , guiding his country to the semi-finals , which was all the more impressive for the fact that he was not blessed with quality in every area of the pitch			0
but he limited his access to the official @entity205 press conferences and that proved a frustration because those gatherings could be manipulated to silence certain journalists , essentially because the media officer decides who gets the microphone you require to ask a question			0
there were senior writers who were left deeply frustrated by the lack of opportunities to engage with their national team coach , particularly when the same reporter from a @entity1 children ’s tv show was invited to ask the final question every time			2
@entity30 and @entity19 share a joke during training ahead of a @entity37 semi-final in 2011 so far here in @entity229 there have been few such complaints			1
reporters would probably consider @entity17 ’s press conferences a bit too brief			2
but for the most part he has been candid and accommodating , and if there have been flashes of that arrogance , aloofness and aggression it is only to be expected			0
these , after all , are characteristics a manager probably needs to lead a club like @entity8 , and were certainly employed to good effect when he followed that astonishing 5 - 3 defeat at @entity246 by tearing into his players in the dressing room			2
as the faces @entity17 encounters in his press conferences become more familiar , and he develops a greater command of @entity21 , there is sure to be more confrontation in that arena too			2
according to my @entity1 colleagues , saturday was fairly tame by @entity17 ’s standards			1
with some relish they often recall a clash he had with a @entity1 reporter during his time at @entity179 when he objected to a question about @entity264			2
‘ you ’re very bad , ’ said a ranting @entity17			2
‘ very , very bad			0
no , no , no , you ’re very bad			0
very bad ! always negative			0
’ give him time , and a few decent results , and there will be plenty more echoes of @entity30			0
video we fought to the end - @entity17 like our @entity8 facebook page .			1
