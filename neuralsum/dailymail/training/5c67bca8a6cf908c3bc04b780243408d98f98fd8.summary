by @entity0 for @entity1 it 's not every day you witness a bear - knuckle boxing match going on in your garden			1
so when @entity8 , from @entity9 , went out to sit on his second - floor deck for a spot of lunch - the last thing he expected to see were two black bear cubs locked in a comical play fight			1
the adorable pair were captured on camera jostling with each other as they rolled around on the grass , paying little heed to the audience they had attracted			2
another more well - behaved cub can also be seen in the 30 - second clip , sticking closer to his mother as the other two , presumably his siblings , battle it out			1
the @entity48 black bear is the continent 's most widely distributed species and is an omnivore with its diet varying greatly depending on season and location			0
black bears often encroach on areas populated by people as they search for food			0
one recently climbed into a resident 's hammock in @entity63 , @entity64 , to take a nap - the incident was one of many cases of bears caught sleeping in hammocks			1
@entity48 black bears have a hugely varied diet ranging from roots , berries meat , fish , insects , larvae , grass and other succulent plants			0

they are the most commonly distributed bear in @entity84 and and are the smallest of three species found on the continent			0
it is estimated that there are at least 600,000 black bears in @entity84 - half in the @entity48			2
they are extremely adaptable and show a great variation in habitat types , though they are primarily found in forested areas with thick ground vegetation			0
cubs remain with their mother for a year and a half or more , even though they are weaned at 6 - 8 months of age .			1

@entity8 , from @entity9 , witnessed the cubs fighting in back garden
