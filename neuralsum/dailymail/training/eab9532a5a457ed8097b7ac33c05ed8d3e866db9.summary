@entity0 have voted to ban abortions on the grounds of gender amid growing @entity5 concern over sex - selective terminations			1
they voted 181 to one to make abortions based on gender illegal , saying the current law had led to ‘ widespread confusion ’ about what was allowed and what was not			1
but the ban is unlikely to come into effect , because the government is not behind the change			2
mps said the current law on abortion had led to ' widespread confusion ' about what was allowed and what was not the only mp who voted against the sex - selective abortions ban was @entity24 , the former actress and @entity26 mp for @entity27 and @entity28			1
during today ’s @entity31 , @entity30 mp @entity29 insisted the law needs to be clarified to make it explicit to doctors that they can not terminate pregnancies because of the sex of the unborn child			1
the mp for @entity39 said ministers could not wait to take action until official figures highlighted a ‘ national skewing ’ in the number of girls born compared to boys			2
she said urgent clarification of the law was needed , because the @entity49 and abortion provider @entity50 argue that sex - selective abortion is not illegal under the 1967 act			1
‘ we can not sit idly by as they contradict ministers over a practice that the government states is illegal , ’ she said			2
‘ urgent clarification from this @entity59 is needed			0
’ mps overwhelmingly backed her desire to bring forward the @entity62 ( @entity63 , which she introduced on behalf of a cross-party group that included 11 other female mps			2
moving her @entity63 , ms @entity29 said : ‘ sex - selective abortions are happening in the @entity68 and there is widespread confusion over the law			1
that is why this @entity63 is needed			0
conservative mp @entity29 has called for sex - selective abortions to be made specifically illegal ‘ it 's extremely straightforward			1
it merely clarifies that nothing in section one of the @entity77 allows a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child			2
‘ it is a shame this clarification is needed			0
successive health ministers and even the prime minister have been very clear			0
they state that abortion for reasons of gender alone is illegal			2
’ she added : ‘ the prime minister has described the practice as simply appalling			0
but they are being ignored			0
‘ the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) , which performs around 60,000 abortions a year , flatly disagrees			0
‘ even today they are still advising women in one of their leaflets and on their website that abortions for reasons of foetal sex is not illegal because the law is silent on the matter			1
‘ the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) holds yet another interpretation			0
they argue there may be cases where having a child of a particular gender may be a legal and ethical justification for an abortion on the grounds that the sex of the child may severely affect the pregnant woman 's mental health			1
’ ms @entity29 said the abuse threatened against women because of the gender of their unborn child should be addressed , with the @entity119 aiming to help them			1
‘ the main motivation is we know sex - selective abortions are happening in the @entity68 and little is being done to stop this , ’ she said			1
‘ we know because of the growing number of courageous women speaking out about their experiences			0
’ mps overwhelmingly backed the motion			0
the @entity63 will now be taken forward for a second reading in january			0
it is , however , highly unlikely to become law in its current form without @entity134 support and parliamentary time			0
a poll by @entity137 for the lobbying group @entity138 found that 84 per cent of people believe gender abortion should be ‘ explicitly banned by law ’ .			1
