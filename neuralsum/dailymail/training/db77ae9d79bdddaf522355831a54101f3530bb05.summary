by @entity0 supermarkets could be forced to pull copycat products from shelves after a small @entity5 food firm won a @entity7 injunction against the budget chain @entity9			1
the @entity11 retailer has been forced to remove its ‘ @entity15 ’ from sale following complaints from the @entity14			1
the packaging and product recipes of the @entity9 products bear an uncanny resemblance to those made and promoted by the @entity22 based firm			1
likeness : the @entity24 sells salmon fillets in a black container with a clear film and a cardboard sleeve ( right )			1
the @entity9 product ( left ) looks virtually identical in terms of pack design and sauce options @entity9 is among a number of high street stores who are trying to win sales by copying the pack design , colours and names used by big brands , which spend millions developing and promoting their products			1
the interim injunction won by the @entity14 is a prelude to a full court hearing that could see @entity9 forced to pay compensation for effectively stealing the idea			1
that could set a precedent that would allow other brands to take on all the big supermarkets which try to boost sales and profits by developing copycat products			1
the @entity24 sells salmon fillets in a black container with a clear film over the top and a cardboard sleeve with the company name and description of the contents			1
one product contains a chilli , lime and ginger dressing , while the other has a watercress and crème fraiche dressing			2
the @entity9 product looks virtually identical in terms of pack design and the two sauce options , while the bold label describes them as ‘ @entity73 ’			1
uncanny : @entity9 's @entity75 caramel and chocolate shortcakes bear a resemblance to the world famous @entity79 bar confusing : @entity9 's @entity81 ( right ) could easily be mistaken for @entity82 ( left ) the interim injunction won by the @entity14 is a prelude to a full court hearing that could see @entity9 forced to pay compensation for effectively stealing the idea the @entity88 is a @entity5 success story			1
it was recently voted a @entity91 and signed a listing with @entity93 earlier this year , while its products will soon be going into stores in the @entity96			2
it is easy to see why @entity9 , which is making a concerted effort to attract middle class shoppers , should want to emulate its success			1
however , head of brand at the @entity22 fish company , @entity104 , said : ‘ @entity9 ’s imitation of @entity106 undermines the trust and confidence consumers have built with us			1
our brand represents a promise of consistency , not easily replicable by packaging alone			2
‘ originality and innovation are two of our watchwords , built through investment over the last three years as we 've nurtured and grown a unique and desired brand , now valued at £ 35m			0
it ’s really important for us to protect our distinctive brand identity as a mark of premium quality , as we grow our brand globally			0
' ’ ghost ’ brands that trade on the halo effect of an established brand simply should not be tolerated and i ’m sure other brand owners will be watching this case with interest			2
’ research by the consumer group which ? found many shoppers are angry at supermarkets who try to mislead them by copying brands			0
a study found one in five of its members have accidentally bought a supermarket version of a product thinking it was a well - known brand			2
of those , 38 per cent said they were annoyed and 30per cent felt misled			0
similar : drinkers could easily be forgiven for confusing @entity9 's own - brand alcohol with more famous products			1
@entity150 's @entity149 closely resembles @entity151 's , while its @entity153 lager looks like @entity154 crunch : @entity157 packs of @entity9 's @entity158 ( right ) look very much like @entity160 's @entity159 ( left ) its research among 150 own - label products found that the cheeky monkey on boxes of @entity165 sold by @entity9 could quite easily be mistaken for the character used by @entity167 ’s for its @entity168			1
similarly , the orange packs of @entity9 ’s @entity170 look very much like the @entity172 ’s product , while its @entity81 could be mistaken for @entity82			1
the firm ’s @entity158 were also similar to @entity160 ’s @entity159 and its @entity174 look like the @entity177 ’s product			2
@entity178 has also come under fire for its @entity181 brand of chocolate biscuits , which are very similar to the @entity184 brand from @entity160 ’s , while @entity186 ’s @entity185 could be mistaken for the @entity188 brand			0
however , other mainstream stores have also been accused of using the same tactic by which ? and the @entity192 , which speaks for manufacturers			0
examples include @entity196 anti-dandruff shampoo , where the white bottle and blue cap and lettering look remarkably similar to @entity200			0
similarly , boots vibrant pink bottle for its ‘ @entity203 ’ shampoo is remarkably like the one for @entity205 ’s popular ‘ @entity204 ’			0
@entity207 ’s tubes of ‘ @entity208 ’ look very much like the market leaders ‘ @entity210 ’ , while ‘ @entity214 ’ from @entity178 appear to owe much to the look of packs of @entity213			0
@entity186 ’s @entity185 ( left ) could be mistaken for @entity216 's famous version of the same product ( right ) director of the @entity192 , @entity218 , said this is the first time a food company has won an interim injunction in these circumstances			2
‘ mimicking the packaging designs of familiar brands is a trick to boost sales			0
a recent government study shows that shoppers make more mistakes and perceive products to be better quality , and are therefore more likely to buy them , than if the packaging is clearly distinctive , ’ he said			2
‘ it is extremely rare for @entity235 to grant interim injunctions so this is a good result for the @entity14			2
the penny is beginning to drop that shoppers are not well served by such copying and the government is consulting on making consumer protection law more effective in this area			0
‘ this would be good news			0
such copying free - rides off brand reputations and does not offer shoppers real choice			0
products should compete on their own merits and not mislead shoppers or act as parasites on brands			0
’ @entity9 ’s @entity250 , who is managing director of corporate buying , confirmed an interim injunction had been implemented , but he said the firm had planned to remove the product from sale			1
he said the injunction was under review and no final decision had been made by the court as to whether it had wrongly or unfairly copied the product			0
he said : ‘ this matter refers to a product that was being trialled in our stores and which has since reached the natural end of the trial period			0
it is important to note that no decision has been made regarding the upholding of the injunction			0

@entity14 claimed supermarket 's products resembled its own
@entity9 salmon fillets have very similar packaging and recipes to @entity24
@entity7 agreed and demanded the @entity11 retailer remove the product
case may have implications for other supermarkets selling ' copycat ' items
