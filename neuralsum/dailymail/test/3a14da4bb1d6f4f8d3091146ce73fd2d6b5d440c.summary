bird numbers have dramatically declined in @entity2 , research has revealed			1
scientists analysed 57 species in the region and found that the majority of populations had diminished as a result of the nuclear accident			2
they found that one breed in particular had plummeted from several hundred before the 2011 disaster to just a few dozen today			0
researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in @entity2 ( shown after the disaster in 2011 )			1
the barn swallow , for example , dropped from hundreds to dozens			1
this is despite radiation levels in the region starting to fall			1
and comparing it to @entity23 could reveal what the future holds the research , published in the @entity27 , was carried out by scientists at the @entity29 including biologist dr @entity30			1
they showed that the situation has steadily worsened since the disaster on 11 march 2011			0
on that day , just over four years ago , @entity36 ’s @entity35 nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by an earthquake and its resultant tsunami			0
the fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the @entity35 on 11 march 2011			0
it was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami , triggered by the 9.0 @entity45 earthquake			0
this led to three of the plant ’s six nuclear reactors going into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials			0
reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean - up effort difficult			1
a total of 300,000 people evacuated the @entity2 area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami			2
many populations were found to have diminished in number as a result of the accident , with several species suffering dramatic declines			0
one of the most hard - hit species is the barn swallow , @entity72 , which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure			1
‘ we know that there were hundreds in a given area before the disaster , and just a couple of years later we 're only able to find a few dozen left , ’ said dr @entity30			2
‘ the declines have been really dramatic			0
’ and while background radiation has declined in the region in recent years , the negative effects of the accident on birds are actually increasing			2
‘ the relationship between radiation and numbers started off negative the first summer , but the strength of the relationship has actually increased each year , ’ dr @entity30 said			0
‘ so now we see this really striking drop - off in numbers of birds as well as numbers of species of birds			0
‘ so both the biodiversity and the abundance are showing dramatic impacts in these areas with higher radiation levels , even as the levels are declining			1
’ dr @entity30 and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors , which use gamma - radiation - sensitive crystals ( shown ) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild one hard - hit species was the barn swallow ( stock image shown ) , @entity72 , which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure the team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for @entity2 from the @entity23 site , which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in @entity126 in 1986			1
one difference noticed so far is that migratory birds fared worse in @entity23 , whereas it was year - round residents that were doing worse at @entity2			1
this could be due to differences in dna repair capabilities for migratory species as a result of flapping their wings - which lowers their antioxidant levels and makes them more vulnerable to radiation			2
the fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the @entity35 on 11 march 2011			0
it was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami , triggered by the 9.0 @entity45 earthquake			0
shown are radiation levels immediately after the accident in 2011			1
