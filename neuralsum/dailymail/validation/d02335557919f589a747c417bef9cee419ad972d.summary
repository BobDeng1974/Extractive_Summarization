this is the moment a pair of skydivers dramatically set fire to their petrol - soaked parachute canopies sending them plummeting to earth at 120 miles per hour			1
@entity6 and his friend @entity7 leapt from a plane over @entity9 in @entity10 armed with a parachute doused in kerosene , a flare gun and a @entity15 camera			1
and after deploying their parachutes , the pair then pull out the guns during their descent to set fire to their canopies			1
@entity6 aims his flare gun at his petrol - soaked parachute after jumping out of a plane over the @entity10 the fire from the gun causes the parachute to ignite and causes a blaze in the mr @entity6 's canopy with just seconds to react and release the now flaming parachutes before the fire travelled down cords to their bodies , the pair free themselves			1
but luckily they also have an emergency parachute , meaning they then glide safely to the ground			1
the pair , who are both experienced professional skydivers and base jumpers , had meticulously planned the dangerous stunt , which took place earlier this year			0
mr @entity7 , from @entity45 , said : ' i was so focused on my task that i did n't have time to be scared or think about what could have gone wrong			2
' the fire then takes hold and starts to travel down the cords to their bodies meaning mr @entity6 has to quickly free themselves after being freed , mr @entity6 then deploys his emergency parachute so he can glide safely back to the ground while mr @entity6 , from @entity55 , added : ' @entity7 jumped first so when i exited the plane i saw something that i will never forget - a big cloud of smoke made by the explosion of his chute			1
' it was like being part of a @entity65 movie for real			0
' the duo had been taking part in a two - week online project called @entity69 , when they travelled to @entity71 and @entity10 to perform the sky dives			2
the potentially deadly fire stunt took place on the last day of their trip			0
mr @entity6 explained : ' we struggled with the weather conditions and the project was on hold for a few days due to a strong wind , which gave us plenty of time for preparation			2
' when the wind finally slowed down , everything happened in a couple of hours			0
@entity7 then attempts the stunt and shoots the kerosene soaked parachute with the flare gun with the parachute in flames , mr @entity7 then starts plummeting to earth at more than 120mph but despite the dangerous stunt mr @entity7 makes it safely back down to the ground thanks to his emergency parachute ' skydiving itself is not without danger and flying in a plane with two big buckets full of gas and two flare guns does n't decrease the risk			1
' you can imagine a lot of things going wrong but with fine tuned preparation there was no room for doubt or uncontrolled fear			0
' but despite the stunt receiving praise from fellow skydiving professionals , there was some online criticism			0
but mr @entity6 explained : ' globally the response was very positive , but we got a couple of messages complaining about the pollution and how immature it was to do that			0
' and i kind of agree , i guess this is why it was so much fun			0

@entity6 and @entity7 leapt from a plane flying over @entity10
they were armed with petrol - soaked parachutes along with a flare gun
after deploying parachutes , they fire their guns to set fire to the chutes
it sends the pair plummeting to the earth at *speeds* of 120 miles per hour
they then release their emergency parachutes and glide safely down
