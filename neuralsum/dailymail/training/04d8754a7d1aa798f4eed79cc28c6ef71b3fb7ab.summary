by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin witnesses from @entity2 and @entity3 in the @entity6 - @entity5 bust - up were branded ‘ hopelessly biased ’ by the investigating official			1
this contributed to @entity9 , the @entity10 judicial commissioner who presided over the tribunal , dropping all charges against the players			2
@entity9 , who reached his conclusion in 10 minutes after a six - hour hearing , reportedly outlined in his written verdict that he could not be ‘ comfortably satisfied ’ about the precise nature of the contretemps in the @entity20 last month			1
this was because there was no video evidence and the only neutral testimony , from one of the @entity27 stewards , was inconclusive			0
common sense prevails : @entity6 has been cleared lf physically assaulting @entity29 ( r ) spat : @entity6 and @entity5 were embroiled in a row as they left the @entity20 pitch delight : @entity6 can not hide his emotions after dismissing @entity5 at the @entity36 @entity37 and @entity6 cleared of wrong - doing @entity9 also suggested @entity5 ’s claim that @entity6 had pushed him ‘ hard and caused him to break stride ’ was a ‘ recent embellishment ’			1
the commissioner was also critical of @entity43 , counsel for the @entity44 , whose suggestion that @entity6 had pushed @entity5 twice did not have ‘ an iota of supporting evidence ’			2
@entity2 claimed @entity6 shoved @entity5 without provocation as the players entered the pavilion for lunch on the second day of the first test and told him to ‘ f * * * * * * go back to the dressing - room ’			1
while @entity6 is said to have agreed he used those words , he insisted that @entity5 had been the aggressor			0
@entity9 said : ‘ obviously one version of the facts must be untrue but the existing cctv image is unhelpful and the witnesses hopelessly biased in favour of one party or the other			0
’ leader of the attack : @entity6 was man of the match in @entity3 's third @entity68 win at the @entity36 for fourth test vs @entity2 at @entity70 , starting on august 7 @entity71 ( c ) , @entity72 , @entity6 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 ( wkt ) , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82			1
he considered downgrading @entity6 ’s charge from a @entity85 offence — with the threat of a four - match ban — to a level 2 and then a @entity90 offence but was unwilling to uphold any charge on the evidence available and suggested the @entity94 ’s @entity93 contained a ‘ number of inadequacies ’			1
he added that a tribunal should not ‘ guess to achieve an outcome , ’ as quoted in his report on the @entity99 website			0
‘ in short i do not know on the evidence , and to the relevant standard of proof , what happened in the corridor leading to the stairway in those few seconds after the batsmen and fielding side came in for lunch			0
‘ i can not be comfortably satisfied as to the truth of either version of the evidence			0
’ ulterior motives ? @entity3 believe that @entity5 's accusations were a purely tactical move by @entity2			2

@entity6 was found not **guilty** of @entity117 offence by @entity94
@entity3 *seamer* is free to play remaining tests at @entity70 and the @entity121
@entity2 all - *rounder* @entity5 was also found not **guilty** of any offence
verdict was reached in 10 minutes by @entity10 judge @entity9
@entity128 is delighted to have @entity6 for rest of @entity131 *series*
