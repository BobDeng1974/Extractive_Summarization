but it has come under fierce attack for leaving the public at risk from unreformed , dangeours criminals			2
the government has admitted that more than 1,600 murderers , druglords and other hardened criminals were granted day release last year			1
inmates who have gone on to commit crimes while on day release include double - killer @entity15			1
he was on his first unescorted day out of prison when he murdered @entity16 , 66 , in july last year			2

he was allowed out to run a second - hand shop , which he used as a front to smuggle drugs into the country hidden in old furniture			0
his disappearance came after the infamous armed robber @entity75 went on the run for four days earlier this month			1
but official figures , released by the @entity78 , reveal that the two escapes were not out of the ordinary			0
in total , some 41,330 passes were handed to 611 criminals serving life sentences last year , giving them ' @entity85 '			1

and many reoffend while they are back on the outside			0
the government has admitted that of these lifers allowed out of prison , almost one in eight breached the terms of their release by either failing to come back , returning back late or committing another crime			2
ministers this morning vowed to overhaul the system to protect the public			2
justice secretary @entity103 said he would scrap the scandal of hardened prisoners walking the streets on ' town leave '			1
he said he was ' tearing up ' the day release system which is used to reintroduuce prisoners back into society			1
' i 'm not happy with the way things are at the moment , ' he said			0
' although the number of people absconding is tiny , we 've seen in the last few months a number of serious offences committed by people on temporary licence			0
but we are tearing up the system as it exist at moment			1
' mr @entity103 said he would ban prisoners being allowed to walk around town centres			2
he said : ' town - leavers will only be allowed out on temporary licence to do something tangible like a day 's work			2
' serious offenders will be subject to a much stricter risk assessment			0
and i ca n't see why we allow back into open conditions people who have absconded before , so i 'm looking at moving reforms in that area quickly			2
' people who have absconded can not go back to open conditions			2
these changes will happen within next few weeks			0
' prisons minister @entity139 said there would be a full assessment of the whole day release system			1
mr @entity139 said a temporary licence could be an important tool to help offenders reintegrate into communities but ' it should not be an automatic right '			0
he said : ' temporary release from prison is not a luxury - it is a way to test those serving long sentences before their eventual release			0
' public protection remains our priority which is why we have introduced crucial changes to tighten the process and scale back assess to temporary licence			0
' this will ensure prisoners are tagged , more strictly risk assessed and tested in the community under strict conditions before being released			0
' but @entity165 backbencher @entity164 , the mp for @entity166 , described the latest disappearances as an ' absolute scandal '			1
he questioned why convicted murderers were ever given temporary release when figures which he obtained through parliamentary answers showed 106 had absconded in the past 10 years			2
mr @entity164 said that when he tabled an amendment to the @entity176 currently going through @entity177 which would have prevented the temporary release of murderers , it was blocked by the government			0
he said : ' it is an absolute scandal in the prison system			0
how on earth people like this can ever be given temporary release from prison on licence is beyond me			0
' this is a regular occurence - murderers are walking out of prison willy nilly			0
i think the whole system is completely ridiculous			1
' armed robber @entity194 , @entity195 the @entity196 , went on the run for four days after absconding from open prison however , @entity199 , chairman of the @entity200 , blamed the cuts for the escapes			0

' twenty prisons have closed in the last three years and prison staff numbers have reduced by 6,000 since 2010			0
' there is immense pressure on the system and it is clear to me that the tick box mentality that goes into transferring prisoners to open conditions has failed the public			0
' @entity220 , assistant chief executive of @entity221 said : ' victims and the public need , and deserve to be protected by the criminal justice system and it ’s critical that a comprehensive risk assessment takes place before release is even considered			1
' we know from speaking to thousands of victims every year the importance of being kept informed about developments in their case , especially if an offender is due to be released			0
' it ’s important that the reasons behind these decisions are properly explained to and understood by victims and the public to ensure confidence is retained in the criminal justice system			2
