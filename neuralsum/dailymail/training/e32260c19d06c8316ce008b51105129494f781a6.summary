@entity0 said he would introduce a 50p top rate of tax for the wealthiest in @entity3 should he become first minister the frontrunner to be @entity7 ’s new leader in @entity3 yesterday demanded full control over income tax for @entity10 despite deep splits in the party over the implications of the move			1
@entity0 , a former shadow cabinet minister , said he was backing full devolution to dispel the idea that senior figures in the party were ‘ more interested in @entity7 than @entity3 ’			1
he said he would introduce a new 50p top rate of tax for the wealthiest in @entity3 if he becomes first minister – and he added that @entity25 and @entity26 ‘ can read about it in the papers like everyone else ’			1
mr @entity0 made the announcement before the publication tomorrow of a cross-party commission on which extra powers should be devolved to the @entity31 following the no vote in september ’s independence referendum			0
the @entity34 , which was charged by @entity35 with getting an agreement among parties , is expected to recommend devolving extra power over income tax			1
both the @entity40 and the @entity41 support the idea , but senior @entity7 figures have warned it will undermine the integrity of the @entity45			0
shadow chancellor mr @entity26 is said to have warned colleagues it is also likely to mean @entity3 mps being barred from voting on tax affairs at @entity50 – a move that could make it impossible for a future @entity7 government to pass budgets			0
instead , @entity7 has previously backed the idea of devolving control of 75 per cent of the basic rate of income tax to @entity3			2
former @entity7 mp @entity59 , who represented an @entity61 constituency , said : ‘ if @entity7 agree that the @entity3 @entity31 shall fix income tax rates in @entity3 , it must also accept that @entity3 mps in @entity50 can longer vote on income taxation levels for the rest of the @entity45			2

’ under reforms in the recently passed @entity79 , members of the @entity3 parliament will soon take control of a 10p share of income tax , with a corresponding cut in the block grant from @entity50 .			0
