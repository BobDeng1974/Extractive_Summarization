by @entity0 published : 15:24 est , 4 january 2014 updated : 08:38 est , 5 january 2014 should @entity1 be charged by @entity2 for taunting @entity4 fans ? @entity1 teased @entity4 supporters with a 2 - 0 scoreline gesture as he was stretchered from the action during @entity10 ’s @entity9 victory at the @entity11			1
the @entity12 were leading thanks to goals from @entity15 and @entity16 when , with seven minutes remaining , @entity1 made the cheeky hand signal to the visiting fans			1
the @entity2 may choose to take action against @entity1 for his taunt , while @entity4 may also come under fire after their supporters showered him with objects			1
cheeky : @entity1 leaves the game on a stretcher and reminds the @entity4 fans of the 2 - 0 scoreline all smiles : @entity1 can not hide his grin as he makes the gesture , to the delight of @entity10 's fans two good : @entity10 were comfortable victors as they booked their place in the fourth round satisfaction : @entity1 continued to tease the visiting fans as he made his way around the pitch they had responded with a hail of coins , as well as a lighter , a plastic cup and a bread bun			1
but @entity1 , who had been forced off with a leg injury , appeared unconcerned and was smiling ear to ear despite the irritation caused			1
he then donned a scarf thrown to him by a member of the home support who were thrilled with their player 's jibe			0
@entity1 ’s team - mate @entity56 also got in on the act and posted a picture mimicking the gesture on his @entity61 account			2
@entity62 : @entity56 copies @entity1 's cheeky gesture in this instagram post @entity66 shot : a matchday steward holds a handful of coins that were thrown in the direction of @entity1 @entity71 : a lighter , a bread roll and a plastic cup were all hurled towards @entity1 the @entity2 will wait until receiving the match report of referee @entity75 before deciding whether the @entity1 incident warrants investigation			1
@entity10 manager @entity78 , however , moved to diffuse the situation			0
' the doctors said to me that the coins had been raining over his ( @entity1 's ) head and they had to protect him , maybe that is why he did that			2
yes ( the coins came before the gesture ) that is what i have been told , ' said @entity78			0
' after that , what he did is not offensive			0
you look for every single incident , i can understand that , but it is an action that did n't offend anybody			0
angry : some of the visiting fans were incensed by @entity1 's cheeky scoreline ' i have seen the pictures after the game and it does not even look aggressive , he is smiling			1
' last month , @entity10 midfielder @entity101 was suspended for two matches after television pictures showed him making an obscene hand gesture towards @entity106 supporters in the 6 - 3 defeat at @entity106			2
@entity78 , though , maintained this situation did not merit any disciplinary action			0
' my response will be simple , they ( @entity2 ) have seen the pictures on television			2
if they judge it offensive , what can i say ? ' the @entity10 boss added			0
injury : @entity1 was taken off on a stretcher towards the end of the @entity9 victory @entity4 manager @entity122 , meanwhile , revealed in his post-match press conference he had not witnessed the incidents			1
@entity122 said : ' someone just mentioned it to me in there			0
i did n't see it			0
' is that what he did ? well , listen i do n't know @entity1 , i do n't know him as a lad			2
it could have been a bit of banter , possibly			0
' if they ( @entity4 fans ) did then it 's a problem , is n't it ? if they did n't then it 's not a problem			1

@entity1 gestured the score at @entity4 supporters as he was taken off the pitch
he could be *punished* by the @entity2 for his actions
@entity4 may also come under fire for their fans ' *behaviour*
