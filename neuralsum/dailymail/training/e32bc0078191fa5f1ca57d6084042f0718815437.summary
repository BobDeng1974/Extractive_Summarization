by @entity1 reporter published : 19:31 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 01:02 est , 12 march 2014 he was said to be a known prankster - and @entity6 had one final laugh planned for his family following his death			1
the 80 - year - old , who died on sunday , had secretly written his own obituary , which relatives found after he passed away			1
his grandson @entity12 posted the epic essay , which is both heartfelt and hilarious to @entity14 on monday , causing a stream of comments from users who were touched by @entity6 's story			1
one @entity14 user wrote : ' great obituaries are ones when after you read it , even if you did n't know the person , you felt a pang of loss and some disappointment of never having had the chance to meet that person			2
this ( sic ) was one of those obituaries			2
' scroll down to read @entity33 in full @entity6 , seen here with his wife @entity35 , was a beloved member of the family and his relatives mourned his passing			1
but making preparations for what needed to be done next , his family stumbled upon an obituary for @entity6 that he had written himself @entity6 's grandson , @entity12 , made the amazing obituary public bty posting on his @entity44 ( pictured ) and then to website @entity14 @entity6 ( right ) pictured in a photo with his grandson @entity12 ( second right ) and other family members while most obits are heartfelt accounts of the deceased individual ’s achievements in life and the loved ones they left behind , @entity6 ’s includes anecdotes about what he 's leaving behind			1
' @entity61 was preceded in death by his tonsils and adenoids in 1935 , a spinal disc in 1974 , a large piece of his thyroid gland in 1988 , and his prostate on march 27th 2000 , ' he wrote			1
even his wife of 57 years , @entity35 , was n't safe , with @entity6 poking fun at her love of fur			1
arguably the best part is a joke about the viewing , according to @entity72			2
' there will be no viewing since his wife refuses to honor his request to have him standing in the corner of the room with a glass of @entity80 in his hand so that he would appear natural to visitors , ' @entity6 wrote			1
@entity6 ended the essay with a request to honour and remember him through ' unexpected acts of kindness '			1
one last laugh : @entity6 had a great sense of humor - and it shows in his self - penned obituary ( below ) here is the obituary in full : @entity93 of @entity94 and @entity95 is a dead person , he is no more , he is bereft of life , he is deceased , he has wrung down the curtain and gone to join the choir invisible , he has expired and gone to meet his maker			1
he drifted off this mortal coil on _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ at _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ at his home in _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _			2
his spirit was released from his worn out shell of a body and is now exploring the universe			2
he was surrounded by his loving wife of _ _ _ _ _ _ years , @entity107 , who will now be able to purchase the mink coat which he had always refused her because he believed only minks should wear mink , his two sons , their wives , and his four grandchildren			2
@entity61 was preceded in death by his tonsils and adenoids in 1935 , a spinal disc in 1974 , a large piece of his thyroid gland in 1988 , and his prostate on march 27th 2000			1
he was born in @entity121			0
@entity122 on april 20th 1933 at 10:38 pm and weighed in at a healthy 7lbs			0
and was 22 ” long , to @entity124 and @entity6			1
he drifted through the @entity125 from 1937 through 1951 , graduating , to his mother ’s great relief , from @entity128 in june of 1951			0
@entity6 was a @entity129 of the @entity130 having served from october of 1951 to september of 1954 with overseas duty in @entity132 from june of 1953 till august of 1954			1
he attained the rank of @entity134			0
he chose this path because of @entity137 propaganda , to which he succumbed as a child during @entity139 , and his cousin @entity140 , who joined the corps in 1943			0
he served an electronics apprenticeship at the @entity121			0
@entity143 from 1956 till 1961 , operated @entity144 in @entity145 during 1961 and 1962 and was employed by the late great @entity146 from 1962 thru 1993 ( very few people who knew him would say he worked for @entity146 and he always claimed he had only been hired to fill a position )			1
he started at the @entity149 as a flunky in the weave area of the @entity152 , and then was promoted to research assistant , where he stayed from 1953 through 1972			0
in 1972 he accepted a position as an equipment service representative with the @entity157 at the old @entity158 ( now @entity159 )			0
in 1973 he was promoted to @entity160 and was employed in that capacity until , after 31 years with @entity162 , he was given a fine anniversary dinner and a token gift and then ‘ downsized ’ in dec. of 1993			0
he was rehired as a contract employee in june of 1994 , doing the same job that he had been ‘ downsized ’ from , and stayed until july of 1995			0
he started his own contract business and worked at @entity168 from 1996 till 1999			0
there will be no viewing since his wife refuses to honor his request to have him standing in the corner of the room with a glass of @entity80 in his hand so that he would appear natural to visitors			0
@entity178 will take place at the family ’s convenience and his ashes will be kept in an urn until they get tired of having it around			2
what ’s a @entity186 ? oh , about 200 drachmas a week			0
everyone who remembers him is asked to celebrate @entity61 ’s life in their own way , raising a glass of their favorite drink in his memory would be quite appropriate			0
instead of flowers , @entity61 would hope that you will do an unexpected and unsolicited act of kindness for some poor unfortunate soul in his name .			0
