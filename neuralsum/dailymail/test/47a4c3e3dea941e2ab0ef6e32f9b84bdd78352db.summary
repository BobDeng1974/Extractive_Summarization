immigration controls in @entity2 are so tough that asylum seekers are rejected on board naval warships at sea before being returned immediately , it emerged yesterday			1
@entity2 prime minister @entity6 says the @entity7 must ‘ urgently ’ follow his lead to stop migrants dying in the @entity10 as they seek a new life in @entity12			1
yesterday @entity14 prime minister @entity13 said his country was ‘ at war ’ with migrant traffickers , describing them as ‘ the slave traders of the 21st century ’			0
they are expected to double funding and equipment for @entity7 border - patrol missions off the @entity40 coast			2
but critics believe millions of impoverished @entity42 and @entity43 are happy to set off into the @entity10 in leaky boats because they are confident humanitarian efforts will save them and speed them to their destination			0
mr @entity6 has insisted : ‘ the only way you can stop the deaths is to stop the boats			1
’ @entity2 detains people on the @entity51 of @entity52 or @entity53 while their asylum applications are considered , in order to avoid them absconding and staying on @entity2 soil while their cases are heard			1
those on @entity52 have the ‘ opportunity ’ to seek a life in @entity62 – which is paid by @entity2 to take them – while those in @entity53 can stay there under a similar deal			2
any who sneak past navy patrols to set foot on @entity2 are barred from staying for ignoring procedure , even if their asylum claim is genuine			1
but it emerged yesterday that @entity2 premier mr @entity6 ’s immigration - control policy is even tougher than had been previously thought			1
it was revealed that officials rejected asylum claims of 46 @entity74 aboard an @entity2 navy vessel – without setting foot on dry land – before the group was handed back to @entity74 last week			1
the screening aboard @entity80 is believed to have happened over a number of days after a boat was intercepted north of @entity2			1
they were returned to the port city of @entity85 , south of @entity86			0
@entity2 ’s @entity74 community leaders warned that the @entity6 government would be ‘ throwing people back to hell ’ by returning the asylum seekers			1
there were reports last year that an asylum seeker from an ethnic minority hill tribe was badly beaten by @entity74 government officials after being returned by @entity62			2
and @entity97 said that claims of persecution by the @entity74 can not have been adequately assessed while still at sea			0
@entity97 ’s @entity101 said : ‘ these reports are extremely concerning and represent a fundamental violation of refugee rights			0
‘ basic screening procedures at sea can not be relied upon to make such life and death decisions			0
‘ instead of digging itself deeper into disrepute by negotiating secretive deals to return asylum seekers , @entity2 should be helping those in need and identifying safe , practical ways for refugees to reach safety			2
the government has repeatedly excused its secretive boat turn - backs by trying to claim that they save lives			0
‘ the return of @entity74 asylum seekers to the very country and government that they have escaped from exposes the truth about the government ’s policies : that they do not save people , but repel people who may need our help			0
’ immigration minister @entity134 refused to comment on the return of the @entity74 but insisted people were not sent back to countries where they would face persecution			0
however , in a video to be shown to asylum seekers on @entity52 , he can be seen urging them to take up the @entity2 offer for them to resettle in @entity62			2
he tells the asylum seekers : ‘ it is a fast - paced and vibrant country with a stable economy and varied employment opportunities			0
