a @entity1 woman who lived in a squalid home where police said they found the skeletal remains of three babies pleaded not guilty monday to two counts of murder			1
@entity8 , 31 , spoke clearly as she was arraigned monday on nine charges			1
superior court judge @entity10 ordered her held without bail			0
her next court date is feb. 4			0
the mother of seven children - four living , three deceased - had originally been charged with fetal death concealment			1
she had pleaded not guilty to that lower charge and has since been jailed on $ 1 million bail			0
earlier this month , a grand jury indicted @entity19 on the nine counts			2
the charges also include two counts of assault and battery on a child causing substantial bodily injury , two counts of reckless endangerment of a child , two counts of cruelty to animals and one count of concealing a fetal death			1
prosecutors said @entity19 gave birth to the five youngest children in the house 's bathroom , attempting to hide their existence from their father because he did not want to have more children			2
she appears to have kept them almost entirely in upstairs bedrooms filled with trash			0
the children ' were n't the only captives in this house , ' he said after monday 's hearing			2
... she was mentally ill to the point where she was incapable of doing anything			0
the house looked the way it looked because she was sick			0
' @entity46 continued : ' if she was determined to murder these children , why did they find three corpses and not five ? ... it does not make sense to portray her as a serial child killer			0
' falling apart : the house was infested with rodents and insects , piled high with dirty diapers and contained dead animals knocked down : workers in hazmat suits spent days cleaning out the house , which was later demolished the two murder charges relate to two dead infants , who were found wearing diapers and one - piece infant outfits			1
the other set of remains were of a fetus , authorities have said			0
all three were found in bedroom closets			0
@entity46 argued in court for @entity19 's release until trial , saying that prosecutors had not made a case for keeping her in isolation in a women 's prison			1
but assistant district attorney @entity106 argued that the circumstances of the case , including the deplorable living conditions in the house and the health of the surviving children , were reasons enough			2
@entity106 said the dead fetus had the placenta and umbilical cord still attached ; a 3 - year - old could neither talk nor walk , was severely malnourished and had maggots in her ears ; and a nearly 6 - month - old appeared to have spent much of her young life on her back			1
state police entered the @entity44 home on sept. 10 after a neighbor had discovered the older children severely neglected			2
police found the house contained dead animals , was infested with rodents and insects and was piled high with dirty diapers and trash			1
workers in hazmat suits spent days cleaning out the house , which was eventually condemned and demolished			1
@entity19 's four living children , who ranged in age from 5 months to 13 years when they were removed from the home in september , are in the custody of state child welfare officials			1
@entity141 , @entity19 's boyfriend and the father of the children , has pleaded not guilty to seven charges , including two counts of assault and battery causing substantial bodily injury and two counts of reckless endangerment of a child			2
he claims he lived in the basement and was unaware of the conditions in the rest of the house , let alone the existence of two of the children - an argument that prosecutors contest			0
@entity141 , 38 , is being held on $ 100,000 bail			0
he is due back in court on jan. 14			0
defense : @entity19 's lawyer @entity46 has said @entity19 ( seen in september ) has mental health issues and that there 's no evidence she caused the babies ' deaths			1
