a young @entity1 ex-pat fled the ' murder island ' of @entity3 in fear of his life today as he claimed two men he suspected had killed two @entity1 tourists there last week wanted him dead too			2
terrified @entity8 , 25 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , hurried to the island ferry after making a desperate phone call for help in the dead of night from an all - night supermarket , where he had been hiding behind the counter from his pursuers			1
he had put out a desperate message on @entity19 as he hid from the two men , declaring : ‘ @entity20 are trying to kill me			1
mr @entity8 , who had met mr @entity31 a few times on the island on social occasions , thought back to the moment when two men who had chased him suggested he kill himself so he could be accused of taking his life because he was the person who had murdered @entity46 and mr @entity31			1
' i 'd gone to a bar and a guy started asking me questions because he knew the guy who died and he had heard my name			2
i was a bit drunk and i started answering them about general things and the murders came up			2
' they just said to me " it was you who killed them ... you 've got two people 's deaths on your hands ... we know it was you			0
' you 're going to hang yourself tonight and we 're going to watch you hang			1
if you do n’t hang yourself , we will do it for you			2
you already have two people ’s deaths on your hands			0
” terrifying : mr @entity8 said he was in a bar on the island when a man started asking him questions about the murder of @entity31 ( pictured before his death in a red cap )			1
when he answered , the man told him , ' you 're going to hang yourself tonight and we 're going to watch you hang ' threats : he said if he had n't run away and hid in a supermarket , the men would have taken him to the hills ' to hang me and make it look like it was suicide ' ' so i just ran			1
i just left and ran			0
they would n’t have shot me - they would have taken me up into the hills to hang me and make it look like it was suicide			2
' they chased me into a shop and i ran behind the counter			0
i went on my @entity19 on my phone and took pictures of the guys and uploaded them straight to @entity19 to say that if anything happens to me everybody knows who did it			1
' mr @entity8 , who has phoned his girlfriend @entity103 , 22 , in @entity104 to tell her that he was safe after his ordeal , said he believed the men needed a scapegoat because ‘ i think they might know who it was			1
’ they needed someone to pin the murders on , he said , because they did n’t want the killers to be locals			0
‘ they want it to be a westerner , so if i kill myself here , if i hang myself here , then it ’s easy to say “ see , it was him			1
” ’ mr @entity8 said the police answered his distress call when the men had fled and escorted him to the guest house where he was staying			1
but he feared the two men would know where he lived , so he fled for the second time that night - this time running into the jungle , where he remained in hiding until daylight			0
scapegoat : mr @entity8 said he believed the men needed a scapegoat because ‘ i think they might know who it was ’ ‘ i made my way down to a bar that i know and i slept for about an hour under a pool table at about 7am			1
‘ i was really scared in the jungle , so i kept moving every 30 minutes in case anybody had seen me			0
i would move from one place to another , just to keep out of sight in case anyone came looking for me there			0
’ mr @entity8 , who arrived on the island two weeks ago to work in a bar and do some busking with his guitar , said he had spoken to the @entity151 by phone during the hours in the jungle ‘ in case i got taken somewhere else			1
but there is only so much they can do for somebody who is on a tiny little island in @entity159			0
’ bungled : he does not believe the police have any chance of catching the killers			0
they had acted too slowly , he said , and had failed to seal the crime scene allowing people to trample over it and destroy much of evidence that might be there the former @entity171 ’s ( @entity10 ) schoolboy said that during his ordeal he telephoned his mother @entity173 - his father was killed seven years ago in a motorcycle accident - to tell her that he loved her because ‘ basically i wanted to say my goodbyes			0
' he added : ‘ i told her that if this was going to be the last conversation that we had then it was a really sad one , but she ’s been great and i love her			0
’ mr @entity8 has his own theory about what happened on the night that @entity46 and mr @entity31 died - a theory that is in line with a suggestion by the @entity186 last week and which mr @entity31 ’s parents tend to agree with			1
the @entity188 said he did not think miss @entity46 was with mr @entity31 when she was attacked and raped , but he had come across the scene and had run to help her - resulting in his own death			2
he does not believe the police have any chance of catching the killers			0
