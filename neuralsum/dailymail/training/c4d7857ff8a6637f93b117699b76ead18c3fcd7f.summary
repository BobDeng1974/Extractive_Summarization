by @entity0 @entity2 scientists have invented a device allowing disabled people to steer their wheelchairs using their ears			1
patients are fitted with chips that pick up the pulses of muscular movements in the human ear			0
those tiny transmissions are converted into a signal to a computer attached to the wheelchair which propels it into motion			2
@entity18 , who led the researchers from three top @entity2 universities , said ; ' the advantage this has over breathing or eye movement to make wheelchairs move is that people do not have to give up looking or speaking to use it			2
' by day five , all ten participants had managed to navigate their wheelchairs around the main building of a hospital in @entity47 - because they learned to wiggle their ears			1
' psychologist @entity49 told a @entity2 website : ' clearly we are talking about an ability which can be learnt in a short space of time , like learning to juggle three balls			0
' @entity18 added : ' we were really baffled by this because half of our participants went into the study claiming that they could not wiggle their ears			0
' the results from our clinical trial have exceeded our expectations			0
' this new technology is intended in particular for people with serious spinal cord injuries , that is for patients who can no longer use their arms and legs			1
' ten participants took part in the study , spending five days learning to navigate through @entity47 hospital , wiggling their ears to move the wheelchairs it is hoped the new technology will help people with serious spinal cord injuries			1

@entity81 *detects* pulses of muscular movement in the ear converting the transmission into a signal to a computer attached to the wheelchair
ten participants managed to navigate around @entity47 hospital by the end of the trial - wiggling their ears to propel the wheelchairs
new technology is aimed at people with serious spinal cord injuries
