small businesses have attacked @entity2 ’s plan to double the length of automatic paternity leave small businesses have attacked @entity2 ’s plan to double the length of automatic paternity leave , saying they would struggle to cope			1
@entity6 announced yesterday that it would increase paid leave for new fathers from two to four weeks , as well as putting up statutory paternity pay by more than £ 120 , to £ 260 a week			1
but the @entity10 said firms would have to shoulder the expense of getting staff in to cover for fathers – a burden many may be unable to afford			1
and the @entity15 said the plan would amount to a ‘ tax on business ’			0
the criticism follows a week of woe for mr @entity2 , who has been attacked by captains of commerce from the head of boots to the former boss of @entity26			1
@entity27 , of the @entity10 , said of the latest pledge : ‘ it ’s important political parties understand the practical implications of policy changes			0
‘ altering paternity leave so soon after introducing shared parental leave has the potential to cause confusion			1
we ’d like to see shared parental leave have a chance to bed in before seeking to give dads extra time off			0
‘ for small businesses in particular , extending paternity leave from two to four weeks makes it much more likely that they will have to buy in replacement staff ... a cost some firms will struggle to afford			1
’ christian may , of the @entity49 , said : ‘ the very firms likely to be hit hardest by this new regulation will be the ones who are already best placed to manage parental leave without heavy - handed legislation			2
small and medium - sized businesses often come to arrangements that suit both parties			2
’ he added : ‘ politicians need to realise that each new whim , each new policy announcement , has a major impact on somebody ’s business somewhere down the line			0
new rules would simply mean more bureaucracy			0
’ @entity68 is also proposing the introduction of a month ’s paternity leave after a child ’s birth on a ‘ use it or lose it ’ basis yesterday , @entity6 ’s welfare spokesman @entity74 dismissed the criticism – saying ‘ good ’ businesses would welcome the move			1
she told @entity79 ’s today programme : ‘ this is exactly what people used to say about maternity leave , that it was a big burden on businesses			2
but the reality is , what good businesses know , is that it is really important to keep women in the workplace once they have children and not let them drift off because they ca n’t manage work and family life			2
that ’s increasingly the case for dads			0
’ labour welfare spokesman @entity74 said ' good ' businesses would welcome @entity2 's plan she added : ‘ good employers like @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97 are already giving more than the statutory paternity leave			1
‘ what good businesses know is that unless they give that flexibility to mums and dads , they are likely to lose their best employees as they will go to a business that does value them , or they will sadly drop out of the workforce altogether			0
’ a new system of shared parental leave , championed by the @entity111 , will come into force in april			0
@entity68 is also proposing the introduction of a month ’s paternity leave after a child ’s birth on a ‘ use it or lose it ’ basis			1
@entity6 said its proposal would cost £ 150million a year , paid for by savings in tax credits			2
it said these would be created by another party pledge , to extend free childcare for parents of three and four - year - olds so that such families would not rely on benefits to pay for care			0
but @entity128 , director general of the @entity129 , said : ‘ whilst well - intentioned , @entity6 fail to understand that companies , especially smaller businesses , ca n’t afford to shoulder the ever - growing financial burden which accompanies policies such as extended paternity pay			1
‘ whilst those about to become fathers will be the winners of this policy , everyone else loses			0
’ @entity140 , of the @entity141 , welcomed the move , saying : ‘ the more that dads are able to engage with their baby in the early days , the better their bond will be , so we want to see all political parties committing to policies like this			0
