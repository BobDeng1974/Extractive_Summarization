photographer @entity12 , 29 , from @entity13 , @entity8 , braved the wind and -3c temperatures to capture @entity17 's daredevil antics on camera			1
@entity0 pedalled at breakneck speeds for four hours to descend the mountain , and as the picture on the right shows , navigating through deep snow was problematic some of the journey was impossible to cycle , so @entity0 was forced to haul his bike up high gradients , all by himself the professional cyclist and surfer pushed his @entity30 to the limit on the slopes of the @entity34 mountains the pair scaled 2,624ft ( 800m ) up the @entity37 peak , which stands at 7,588ft ( 2,313m ) , to take the pictures at 6am			1
