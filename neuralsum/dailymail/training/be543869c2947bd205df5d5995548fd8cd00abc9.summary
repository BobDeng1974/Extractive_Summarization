a @entity1 destroyer was scrambled to @entity2 in a major security scare after a @entity5 aircraft carrier came within 30 miles of @entity7 shores for the first time in 20 years			1
@entity9 travelled around 1,000 miles from @entity10 to keep watch as the 65,000 tonne @entity12 and a number of other battleships anchored on the edge of @entity7 waters			1
today the @entity17 accused the @entity5 of dumping waste into the water while moored off the coast at @entity21 on monday			1
they are believed to be still in the area today while they avoid poor sea conditions but are no longer anchored			0
previously defence chiefs would have scrambled @entity39 aircraft from @entity40 in @entity21 but because the base has been scrapped in cutbacks and a new fleet of planes cancelled , the @entity1 had no choice but to send @entity9			0
although the @entity5 fleet was outside @entity7 waters it was within the exclusive economic zone which @entity7 has the sole rights to exploit			1
the @entity12 is en route to the @entity51 from its northern base at @entity53 for exercises with the @entity5 @entity55			2
a spokesman for the @entity57 said : ' the @entity12 , with other warships and support vessels , is thought to be en route to the @entity51 on exercise			0
' the aircraft carrier anchored outside @entity7 territorial waters some 30 miles off the @entity21 where she was thought to have taken advantage of the relative shelter to avoid the worst of current bad weather in the @entity69			1
' @entity71 leader and @entity73 spokesman @entity72 has condemned the ' marine fly - tipping ' and is asking the @entity75 what it has done about the incident			0
mr @entity72 said : ' given the bad weather conditions the @entity5 vessels are very welcome to shelter off the @entity2 coast , but it is more than bad manners to dispose of waste by simply throwing it overboard			1
' this is in contravention of agreements and normal practice and i think we need answers from the @entity5 and @entity7 governments			1
although two decades may have passed since the collapse of the @entity94 , @entity7 faces a new @entity5 threat as @entity96 flexes his military muscle			1
@entity99 @entity98 are regularly scrambled to intercept supersonic invaders approaching @entity7 airspace			2
in 2009 alone , jets were sent up 20 times to repel @entity5 warplanes			2
after a gap of 15 years , @entity96 resumed the intrusions in 2007			0
on one occasion , an eight - strong force was detected heading this way from the @entity110			0
they 're not infringing any law while they stay in international airspace , but they can not be ignored			0
however , until now the false battle has been consigned skies			0
the @entity12 was the first @entity5 vessel to get so close to @entity7 shores for 20 years			1
@entity7 military aircraft are on standby 24 hours a day and can be scrambled in minutes to respond to threats			2
' have the appropriate authorities been informed ? what was disposed of ? why was it not done properly ? ' in a series of parliamentary questions mr @entity72 is asking the @entity75 about the incident			0
he wrote : ' will the @entity57 confirm that @entity5 personnel aboard the @entity12 have been observed disposing of waste into the sea off the @entity2 coast ? ' ' was the @entity133 informed about the waste disposal ? ' has the @entity135 and @entity136 been informed about the incident by @entity133 ? ' a @entity1 spokesman added that @entity5 was ' almost certainly ' acting in accordance with international rules			1
he said : ' @entity5 is signed up to the @entity142 's maritime pollution rules , of which they are very strict followers			0
if they are doing it , it 's almost certainly in accordance with the regulations and is most likely going to be low - level food waste			0
' although aircraft carriers have not got so close to @entity7 waters for 20 years , jets have been scrambled to intercept @entity5 planes			1
@entity99 @entity98 have been sent up 20 times in 2009 alone after the foreign aircraft got close to @entity7 airspace			0
air interception : an @entity158 ( top ) escorts a @entity5 @entity161 plane in 2007 after eight @entity5 military aircraft which were approaching @entity7 airspace			2

@entity5 crews ' blamed bad weather ' for having to approach @entity7 waters
