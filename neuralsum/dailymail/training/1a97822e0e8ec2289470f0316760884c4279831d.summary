@entity0 beat rival and incumbent @entity13 with 55.68 per cent of the vote against 44.32 per cent in yesterday 's run - off ballot between the two men , according to results released by the electoral authorities today			1
a former official under @entity10 , @entity0 recast himself as a technocrat			2
his secular party @entity21 - call for @entity2 - profited from a backlash against the post-revolt @entity25 government , which many voters blamed for turmoil after 2011			1
outside the @entity21 headquarters in the capital @entity31 , several hundred jubilant supporters took to the streets to celebrate , waving @entity2 's red and white national flag , singing and honking car horns			2
@entity37 supporter @entity36 said : ' we succeeded in part of our struggle			0
' these elections were just one round , but the battle to build @entity2 just started			0
' @entity13 made no immediate statement , but his campaign 's official @entity46 page said he had congratulated @entity48 on his victory			1
just after results were announced , protesters set fire to a @entity21 party office in @entity54 in southern @entity2			1
rioting also broke out in another southern town , @entity56 , with police firing teargas to disperse hundreds of youths who burned tyres to demonstrate against the return of @entity10 's old guard			1
critics of @entity48 , an 88 - year - old former parliamentary speaker under @entity10 , see his return as a setback for the 2011 uprising that ousted the veteran ruler and put the @entity71 country on the road to full democracy , with a new constitution and free parliamentary and presidential elections			1
the @entity2 uprising also inspired the @entity79 revolts across @entity71 and the @entity80			0
@entity82 president @entity81 and @entity82 secretary of state @entity83 are said to have congratulated @entity48 on his victory and @entity2 on its conclusion of the first presidential election under the new constitution			0
just after results were announced , protesters set fire to @entity92 party office in @entity54 in southern @entity2 ; rioting also broke out in another southern town , @entity56 , withpolice firing teargas to disperse hundreds of youths who burned tyres to demonstrate against the return of @entity11 @entity10 's old guard @entity83 said : ' @entity2 has provided a shining example to the region and the world of what can be achieved through dedication to democracy , consensus , and an inclusive political process			1
' compromise has been important in @entity2 politics			0
@entity48 's @entity21 reached a deal with the @entity111 party to overcome a political crisis triggered by the murder of two secular leaders last year			2
as frontrunner , @entity0 dismissed critics who said victory for him would mark a return of the old guard			2
he distanced himself from the corruption and abuses of @entity10 's era , and argued that he was the technocrat @entity2 needed following three messy years of an @entity25 - led coalition government			0
@entity13 , who had sought refuge in @entity125 during the @entity10 era , painted a potential @entity48 presidency as a reverse for the ' @entity129 ' that forced the former autocrat to flee into exile			2
but many tied @entity13 to the @entity111 government			0
accepting former regime officials - known as the ' remnants ' by their critics - back into politics had been one of the compromises that helped restore calm and keep @entity2 's often unsteady transition to democracy on track			0
victory for @entity48 consolidates his secular @entity21 party 's position after it won the most seats in october 's parliamentary election , beating out @entity25 party @entity111			1
@entity0 's party will now have to decide on a prime minister and form a new government in coalition with smaller parties in the parliament before tackling @entity2 's low - level @entity25 militancy and politically sensitive economic reforms			1
@entity111 holds the second largest number of seats in congress and it and leftist @entity161 movement are still strong movements that will prove tough opponents in negotiations over policy in parliament			0
