auctioneers have been condemned by @entity2 leaders after selling off a haul of @entity5 memorabilia in @entity6 this week			1
on thursday , about 20 items from @entity8 went under the hammer and were sold to military enthusiasts willing to fork out between $ 300 and $ 700 for a slice of @entity5 history			1
amongst the 560 - item auction were @entity5 flags , @entity16 runes and a gas mask case			2
about 20 @entity5 items from @entity8 were sold on thursday , including swastika - emblazoned flags the auction came just days before sunday 's commemoration of the 70th anniversary of d - day that contributed to @entity25 forces winning @entity26 but @entity27 of @entity29 president @entity28 said auction house @entity30 should have known better than to remind survivors of the @entity33 and their families of the horrific time			1
' there are various ways of looking at this			0
the obvious thing - but not in this case - is that people are hoarding and keeping manifestations of an evil part of world ’s history , ' he said			0
' they cling to it and see ( @entity49 ) as unfinished work			0
' in this particular case it was literally an estate and it ’s sad that someone did hoard it and everyone should realise the distress it causes			0
this gas mask case were part of the 560 - item auction held by @entity30 in @entity6 ' it ’s particularly irresponsible of the auctioneer to profit by it , especially when the world ’s biggest auction house , @entity65 , does not permit this stuff to be auctioned			1
that ’s the crux of it			0
' it has been 70 years since @entity26 , but mr @entity28 said it did not lessen the effects the @entity5 regime had on survivors			2
' they would not realise what it meant for someone to see a @entity16 or swastika , they can not know what it means to the family , ' he said			0
the @entity2 community says the auction would have caused distress to survivors of the @entity33 ' it is not only felt by @entity2 but a lot of @entity91 suffered unnecessarily because of @entity92 - there were many good @entity91			1
' another thing that helps demonstrate the magnitude of what happened is that not only six million @entity2 were lost , but there 56 million people lost because of the war that @entity92 started			2
' despite the controversy , @entity30 auctioneer @entity99 said they had received no direct complaints from the community			0
@entity16 swords and daggers sold for between $ 500 - $ 700 each , and flags were sold for between $ 300 - $ 500 he said it was never the auction house 's intention to offend anyone			1
' i do understand the history ( of the @entity33 ) and am aware of it , but there was absolutely no feedback to express discuss or furore at the sale , ' mr @entity99 said			2
' i am very sympathetic to the @entity2 community and @entity30 had no intention of offending anyone and we regret if we have			1
' @entity30 said they never meant to cause offence and were deeply sympathetic to the @entity2 mr @entity99 said he had decided to go ahead with the auction because there was a demand for military memorabilia in the past			2
' they were @entity91 memorabilia but in previous auctions we have had militaria from all different nationalities and they always sell very well , ' he said			0
' we were n’t selling it to any neo-nazis or radicals or anything like that , they were all militaria enthusiasts			0
' @entity16 swords and daggers were sold off for between $ 500 and $ 700 each and the @entity5 flags went for between $ 300 and $ 500 each .			1
