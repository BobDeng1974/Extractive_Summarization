a spelling mistake in the words ' not recommended ' on the @entity4 website led to the site going down , it was revealed today in internal notes from ' war room ' meetings of experts scrabbling to breathe life into the shambolic operation			1
the error limited the choices @entity4 shoppers were offered in october and often presented them with overpriced options			0
ultimately , at least some of the website 's many outages were brought about by this simple typo , as technicians struggled to give the public an experience that mirrored president @entity23 's promises			1
' in states where the federal government helps run these marketplaces , the average @entity24 will have more than 50 different plans to choose from , with different levels of coverage , ' the president claimed during a september 26 speech in @entity32 , @entity33			1
' and because insurance companies are competing against one another for your business , a lot of @entity24 will pay significantly less for their insurance than they do now			0
' in large measure , that did n't happen			0
and a tech team met at least once per day in october to sort out this and hundreds of other technical problems with the ill - fated roll out			2
one of the reasons the @entity4 website ground to a halt so often in october was a typo in the system that determined whether states had certified insurance companies to participate in the federal health care exchange as a result of the spelling error , so few insurance plans were green - lighted that insurance shoppers started seeing ' fewer options than would be desired to promote consumer choice ' in a section of the group 's october 28 notes titled ' certification suppression updates , ' a meeting secretary recorded that ' [ p ] erhaps due to a misspelling in " not recommended , " there are errors in the certification suppression data			1
' it 's not clear how the phrase was mangled , but ' recommended ' is commonly misspelled with an extra letter ' c. ' ' [ @entity74 ] his misspelling was not recognized in the system , ' the notes continue , ' and it is not updating accurately as a result			1
' certification and suppression refer to the thumbs - up and thumbs - down rulings made on each health insurance plan carried on the @entity4 website			1
the decisions are based on insurance companies ' ability to show that their home states have approved their participation in the federal government - run marketplace			2
but when the eligible plans began to show up on the website in october , their numbers were suspiciously few in many of the 36 states covered by the exchange			0
as a result , the meeting notes show , ' in some cases , there will be fewer options than would be desired to promote consumer choice and an ideal shopping experience			1
' @entity107 chief @entity106 supervised the @entity4 website 's creation , which led to late - night comedy jokes and left a flood of politicians from both sides of the aisle scrambling ' additionally , in some cases there will be relatively high - cost plans ' since the low number of options limited competition			1
the meeting notes were released this week by the @entity123 - controlled @entity122 , whose chair rep. @entity126 of @entity127 has been critical of the @entity4 and its reliably problematic launch			1
an official with one of the private contractors tasked with delivering healthcare.gov to the federal government confirmed to @entity134 that the @entity4 website 's policy certification and suppression system was ' down more than it was up for the first two weeks of october			1
' ' it was a huge problem , ' he said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to comment publicly about his company 's work			0
another promise ignored ? the president claimed in september that ' the average @entity24 will have more than 50 different plans to choose from ' -- but a typo limited that number severely hot seat : @entity151 secretary @entity150 testified before a @entity153 panel on wednesday but did n't face questions about innocuous - looking typos the @entity4 team has had problems from the beginning navigating the tricky task of deciding which health care plans qualify for inclusion in among those offered on healthcare.gov			1
on october 8 , one week after the site 's premiere , the war room meeting notes show that a project manager requested ' a schedule to suppress / un-suppress ' insurance policies at least once per week			1
a decision was made that day , while millions of @entity24 were already trying – with little success – to use the website , to submit each friday a ' weekly suppression list ' of plans that should not have been included , with computer experts culling them over the weekend			2
' how many changes are we approving ? hundreds , ' according to the meeting notes			2
those changes also included tweaks to the insurance policies , including one @entity184 plan whose issuer decided late in the game that it would n't cover weight - loss surgery , since its competitors had already decided not to			0
in another case , the website was offering a dental provider 's plans even though they were supposed to be ' suppressed ' from public view			0
' [ @entity197 ] e can not independently confirm if they are suppressed or not , ' the war room heard , ' and we do not know if the problem is wide - spread			2
' by october 15 , the team discovered another massive fly in the ointment			0
@entity134 went to healthcare.gov on wednesday to see available plans in states covered by the federal exchange , but waited more than 10 minutes after trying to create an account ... ... and ultimately the website was unable -- three times -- to register a new user discussing the system for @entity211 and @entity212 ( @entity213 ) that insurers must use to submit their plans through the government 's @entity210 ( @entity210 ) , they learned that the weekly updates of ' certified ' plans would wipe out the entire database and force them to start from scratch			0
' this resubmission ( @entity210 and @entity213 ) will wipe out all certification / suppression statuses in the universe , ' the notes show they determined , ' so we will need to get @entity226 a file with new statuses for everyone , yes ? ' ' yes , if an issuer resubmits a template with just one plan change , it changes all the plans for the issuer , so it is good practice to have a full file			0
' on the following day , according to the meeting notes , the team heard that they now had ' a good process for determining if an issuer should be suppressed / unsuppressed , but it wo n't be ready by noon tomorrow			2
' many of the plans that were hung up behind red tape were those that saw steep rate increases , triggering a requirement that their state governments re-evaluate them before the @entity4 system could offer them to the public			2
' for a lot of them , they have rate filings with rate increases of 10 % or greater , ' the group heard on october 21 , ' and the state has to put in a rate filing determination and they have n't			0
that happened for about half			0
' @entity264 spokeswoman @entity263 said during a november 1 conference call with reporters that @entity267 is budgeted to cost as much as $ 630 million .			0

a typo in the phrase ' not recommended ' *hamstrung* the @entity4 website 's system for determining which insurance plans were fit to offer
the result : consumers saw fewer options with higher prices
@entity23 promised in september that ' the average @entity24 will have more than 50 different plans to choose from '
' war room ' meeting notes , released by a @entity123 - run *congressional* *committee* , revealed hundreds of tech problems
