by @entity0 published : 12:59 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 01:42 est , 24 august 2012 @entity1 , one of princess @entity3 's confidantes , defended the young prince today one of princess @entity3 's closest friends has defended prince @entity8 's naked @entity7 antics by insisting he has done nothing ' wrong or immoral '			1
as nude photographs of the prince made headlines around the world , @entity1 said that @entity8 's mother had always believed in the distinction between her public and private life			1
ms @entity1 told the @entity18 : ' the same distinction should apply to her sons , both of whom are serving their country			1
' he is first and foremost a soldier			0
he has served one tour in @entity26 and will be returning			0
' young men in that situation always have it in the back of their minds that they may not come home			0
the second tour of duty is much harder than the first			0
' he is n’t married			2
he has the absolute right to privacy in his private time			1
he has n’t done anything wrong or immoral			0
' ms @entity1 posted a message of support for ' top ging ' @entity8 on her @entity45 page , including a picture bearing the message : ' sometimes you just have to pick yourself up and carry on			1
the pictures of the naked royal with an unidentified naked woman in a @entity7 hotel suite , first revealed to the world on @entity55 celebrity gossip site @entity56 , have not been published in the @entity58 press			1
to see the pictures , the public has had to access @entity56 , or scores of other internet pages across the globe carrying the images			0
although the incident is embarrassing for @entity8 , who is due to embark on the next phase of his military career , he will not face repercussions from army bosses			0
the @entity70 confirmed to the @entity18 that military officials will not take action against the young royal			1
an official said : ' since this all happened in private and was not against the law , it is not a breach of military discipline			2
' today a leading lawyer said that editors are respecting past rulings on privacy and their own press watchdog by not publishing the candid pictures			1
@entity58 newspapers complied with a request from @entity88 , made via the @entity89 ( @entity89 ) , to respect @entity8 's privacy and not use the images as they were taken in a private hotel room			1
media commentators said the newspapers have been ' neutered ' by @entity95 's inquiry into media ethics			0
but media lawyer @entity97 said editors realised they had to comply with the wishes of @entity88 : " it 's because they were asked not to by the @entity89 and they accepted it was probably the better way to go			2
@entity8 was also pictured preparing to race @entity104 swimmer and gold medallist @entity105 , in the white t - shirt , in a @entity7 swimming pool surrounded by partygoers , the prince and @entity105 were pictured discussing their race ' we have seen many examples , going right back to @entity113 when she was being courted by the former king ( @entity115 ) , when the @entity58 press declined to publish a story that was widely available			1
' what we have is a story running on social media which the reasonable media here have n't taken up			2
' he added that a number of high profile court cases involving celebrities had changed the way the press handle privacy			1
' the courts have said for a long time that photographs are more intrusive ( than words ) , like the @entity134 case , " said mr @entity97			2
in 2002 a judge allowed a sunday newspaper to publish the details , but not the photographs , of @entity139 visiting a prostitute in a @entity142 vice club			0
mr @entity97 said : ' we do n't need to see the pictures , they are gratuitous			2
it 's for that reason they stay away from it			0
' former @entity151 executive editor @entity150 said he would have published the photos before the inquiry into media ethics began , and the @entity95 hearings had " neutered " the press			2
he told @entity158 's @entity157 : ' the situation is fun , it 's a good , classic newspaper situation			0
the problem is , in this @entity164 era where newspapers are simply terrified of their own shadow , they dare n't do things that most of the country , if they saw it in the newspaper , would think " that 's a bit of a laugh "			2
' one non-mainstream @entity58 website to publish the pictures was the @entity177 political blog			1
@entity8 was pictured wearing a top borrowed from a female partygoer in a @entity7 pool as the revealing photographs hit the internet , @entity8 was spotted in @entity183 ahead of a flight back to @entity58 and the @entity185 also broke ranks , splashing on the story by creating a mock - up of one of the images with naked staff posing as @entity8 and the woman			1
the prince is back in the @entity58 and is not expected to attend the opening of the @entity195 next week but is likely to attend some of the events to support the country 's disabled athletes if his military duties allow			1
a @entity89 spokesman confirmed that @entity88 had contacted the organisation so the regulatory body could raise the @entity88 's concerns with editors			0
he said it was a procedure open to all members of the public : ' there was n't a formal complaint , this is a system available to people at the heart of a news story who feel the @entity215 ' @entity214 is likely to be breached			2
' they thought prince @entity8 had a reasonable right to privacy , being in a private hotel			1
' @entity56 said the photos were taken last friday after the prince and his entourage met some women in a hotel bar and invited them up to the royal 's suite			0
the group played a stripping game and someone in the party is thought to have captured the image of the naked prince on a camera phone			1
in the first photograph , the royal is shown wearing just a necklace and a wristband with his hands around his genitals as a seemingly topless woman stands close behind him			0
the nude prince is shown in another picture shielding himself behind an unknown woman who is also naked , with his bare bottom facing the camera			0
but there is no suggestion that anything other than horseplay is going on between the royal and the unnamed woman			0
a source said the prince was just ' letting off steam ' before the next important phase of his military career			0
the pictures are the latest gaffe by the prince , whose past indiscretions include smoking cannabis as a teenager , being photographed in a @entity264 uniform at a fancy dress party , and scuffling outside a nightclub with a photographer			1
a number of the prince 's charities have refused to comment about the pictures .			0

@entity1 tells @entity18 : ' he is n't married . he has the absolute right to privacy in his private time . '
@entity70 will not take action against the party prince
