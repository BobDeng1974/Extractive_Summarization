with its metallic gold finish , glistening alloy wheels and seats encrusted with semi-precious stones , it 's little wonder that this stunning @entity7 cost around £ 200,000			2
but you 'd have to be pretty tiny to take the supercar for a spin			0
this is the world 's most expensive model car and it 's just gone on display at the @entity7 showroom in @entity15 as the car manufacturer celebrates its 50th birthday			1
the model was designed by @entity39 mechanical engineer @entity38 and sculpted from the same carbon fibre used to make @entity32 cars			1
one shaped , the carbon fibre has been wrapped in a wafer thin thread of solid gold			0
mr @entity38 said : ' i wanted to do what no - one else has done before , to build a model car that is an " icon within an icon "			1
' i wanted to create a tribute to the legend of the automobile			0
crafted : mr @entity38 , pictured , said : ' i wanted to do what no - one else has done before , to build a model car that is an " icon within an icon " ' brilliant finish : even the car 's alloy wheels are ultra realistic and made from the highest quality material world tour : the impressive 1:8 replica will go on display over the @entity71 period and will then tour the world before being auctioned off ' in five years time , auto technology will have changed drastically , so i wanted to say a thank you to the pioneers of the technology			1
' the car is a prototype for a finished product that will come complete with gold and platinum rims , seats , cockpit and steering wheel , front seats embedded with 700 precious stones and headlights made from high - quality clear diamonds			1
a @entity39 auction house has put a price tag of £ 8.6m on the final model - with £ 420,000 of the fee set to go to charity , although @entity95 is offering a ‘ buy - it - now ’ price of £ 4.6m			1
comparison : the car is pictured next to a real @entity99 , which is not much more expensive at a retail price of around £ 236,000 design process : an engineer using a computer programme to manufacture the impressive replica work in progress : a carbon fibre specialist works on the exterior of the @entity7 in @entity39 glamorous : even the replica 's seats are pricey - they are encrusted with semi-precious stones the prototype will take pride of place in the luxurious @entity115 until @entity71			1
it will then be taken on a mini world tour , with stops in @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 , before heading to auction at some point in 2014			1
there have been a handful of enquiries about purchasing the finished product and the @entity39 engineer is offering a commission of $ 250,000 ( £ 155,000 ) to anyone who helps him find a buyer			1
@entity38 was also keen to point out that the buyer will be able to customise the final model to meet their most decadent desires			1
he said : ' in the end it is the customer who will decide exactly what the most expensive and most precious model car in the world will look like - because the buyer can determine according to his preferences , what material will be used			1
' intricate work : engineers sculpt the exact shape of the @entity7 supercar under the spotlight : the car will be put on show in @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121 a little more expensive : the @entity150 is a limited edition hypercar which costs more than £ 3.3million buying the replica prototype is unlikely to cost much less than a real @entity99 , which retails at around £ 236,000			2
but the @entity99 is not the manufacturer 's most expensive model			1
the newly released @entity150 , with its 750bhp v12 engine and top speed of 220mph will set you back a cool £ 3.36million			0
the car goes on display as the manufacturer celebrates its 50th birthday			2
at 50 some things are past their best - but after half a century @entity7 continues to roll out cars faster , more glamorous and even more bizarre than ever			0
on october 30 , 1963 , @entity164 showcased his first sports car at the @entity166			0
that day the @entity167 , an unfinished prototype featuring a crate of ceramic tiles instead of an engine , was scorned by critics			0
source of scorn : on october 30 , 1963 , @entity164 showcased his first sports car at the @entity166 flash : the @entity176 from 1965 , @entity177 from 1965 , and @entity178 from 1964 all pictured outside the manufacturer 's head office nice car : the @entity182 but over the next 50 years the company 's models - which include the @entity99 , @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 - would go on to become the envy of petrol heads worldwide			1
famed for their flamboyance and flair , the now - famed car company originally started out as a tractor company , @entity193 , in the mid- 1950s			2
@entity7 became one of the largest agricultural equipment manufacturers in @entity196 also making gas heating and air conditioning units			0
but it was as a car manufacturer he would make his name			2
classic : the @entity204 convertible : the 1998 @entity205 following the poor showing in @entity209 , a year later the company turned heads when it revealed the refined 350 gt at the @entity211 - the car would go on to sell for $ 13,900 ( £ 8600 ) or $ 103,000 today			2
after the success of the @entity178 the 60s saw the company produce such other well - received , iconic roadsters as the @entity215 and the @entity187			0
in 1972 , following some years of union unrest , @entity164 sold the controlling stake in his company for $ 600,000 - the @entity196 then started to have less involvement in the company			0
two years later , the company unveiled the @entity220 - a sleek , futuristic sports car that would go on to become the company 's best - selling vehicle from 1974 to 1988			2
on the road : the @entity225 unusual : the manufacturer departed from the norm with the @entity228 @entity164 's vision was always to create the most beautiful - and powerful - super sports cars in the world - and the @entity220 epitomised this vision			1
in 1987 , after the less - well - received @entity234 and @entity235 were released and declaring bankruptcy in 1978 , the company was sold to @entity237 for $ 25.2 million			0
following this acquisition @entity7 began its development of faster , more - bold vehicles - the release of the @entity205 , then the fastest production car in the world , helped put the company back in the limelight , acting as the company 's mainstay throughout the 90s			1
towards the end of that decade , in 1998 , the company was sold again - this time to the @entity250 group for $ 110 million			0
brilliant white : the @entity234 classy : the @entity254 model the vision was to have a more sporty output from the @entity250 group and this promise lived up to expectation with the production @entity186 and later the @entity185 - or ' @entity261 ' - which was released in 2003			2
today , @entity7 , which produced 2,197 vehicles in 2012 , is headed by the @entity99 , @entity185 , @entity263 and @entity264			0
the celebrations this year have been marked by the release of plans for the @entity269 concept : a one - seater supercar , described as ' hyper - sophisticated ' by its designers			0
a @entity150 , costing a cool $ 4.5 million , was also announced last week			0
the future 's bright : the @entity187 2			0

the model was designed by @entity39 mechanical engineer @entity38
it is a small scale replica of a @entity26 700 - 4
the car will go on sale at the manufacturer 's @entity15 showroom
it will then go on a world tour before it is eventually auctioned off
