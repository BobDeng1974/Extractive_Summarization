beaten @entity2 semi-finalists @entity0 lost again as they were defeated by @entity3 in a scrappy @entity5 game at the @entity6 on wednesday night			1
although @entity0 dominated most of the match , they wasted several chances in the closing stages of the first half			1
@entity3 held firm and grabbed the winner seven minutes from the end , when @entity15 nodded in his 16th goal of the season			1
@entity15 ( left ) scored a late headed winner for @entity3 as his side defeated @entity0 1 - 0 @entity15 , who signed from @entity20 in the summer , scored his 16th goal of the season @entity0 : @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 ( @entity28 63 ) , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 ( @entity33 63 ) , @entity34 ( @entity35 81 ) subs not used : @entity38 , @entity37 , @entity39 , @entity40 booked : @entity31 @entity3 : @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 ( @entity46 62 ) , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 ( @entity50 34 ) , grounds , @entity15 , @entity52 ( @entity53 77 ) subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 referee : @entity60 attendance : 14,604 @entity0 were involved in a dramatic 2 - 1 defeat against @entity63 , after extra-time , in the last four of the @entity2 at @entity65 on saturday			1
goalkeeper @entity22 , whose fumble led to @entity68 's winning goal , was retained against @entity3 - as were six of his fellow starters from @entity65			2
at least @entity0 had no pressure on them , the last lingering doubts of relegation having been removed when @entity75 lost 2 - 0 at @entity76 on tuesday night			2
@entity3 had little to play for either , apart from trying to improve on a poor recent record of just two wins in eight league matches			0
a predictably dour opening , with neither side keen to force the pace , ended when @entity52 aimed at @entity22			0
but it was a weak effort that did not trouble the @entity85 goalkeeper			0
@entity0 , with only two wins in 13 league games behind them and no wins in six , responded swiftly as the game warmed up			0
@entity27 , scorer of @entity0 's equaliser against @entity63 , fired wide after a long pass from @entity24			2
a @entity24 header lacked the power to test @entity3 keeper @entity41 , @entity32 shot wide after @entity29 had been blocked out , and @entity32 and @entity34 had close - range efforts cleared to safety			2
@entity41 made a flying save to keep out a fierce @entity27 shot and the keeper also had to stop two decent long - range attempts from @entity99			0
@entity0 fans showed their support for @entity102 following his blunder at @entity65 on saturday @entity15 goes one - on - one with @entity22 , who was hoping to make amends for his mistake against @entity63 @entity3 threatened only rarely , @entity45 blazing over from a @entity49 cross , which @entity15 had missed , and @entity108 heading straight at @entity109 from a @entity45 corner			1
@entity0 kept up the momentum after the interval but , as @entity3 defended stubbornly , the home side spoiled good approach work with poor final touches			1
@entity26 did manage to fashion a chance when wriggling clear of his markers but drove straight at @entity118			0
@entity0 lost their second game in as many matches as their poor @entity5 form continues @entity3 continued to sit back , inviting the pressure			1
@entity31 missed with a powerful drive and then drilled over a low cross that no team - mate was able to reach			0
@entity50 was off target from distance but @entity0 regained the upper hand with efforts from @entity30 , a 20 - yard shot saved by @entity41 , substitute @entity132 and @entity26			0
@entity3 rallied late on , with @entity22 having to make two smart saves to deny substitute @entity53			0
and the visitors broke the deadlock in the 83rd minute			1
@entity48 delivered a corner from the left and @entity15 rose unchallenged to glance a header past the helpless @entity22 .			2

@entity0 are 18th in the @entity5 while @entity3 sit in 15th
@entity15 's 83rd minute header secured the three points
the @entity2 semi-finalists dominated *possession* but were made to *pay*
