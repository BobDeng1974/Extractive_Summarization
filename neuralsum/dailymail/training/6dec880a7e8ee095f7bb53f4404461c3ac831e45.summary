@entity2 - proud @entity1 readers have told of their delight at beating the @entity5 ban by hoovering up high - powered vacuum cleaners in our special promotion			1
among the first to bag one was businessman @entity11 , who says his @entity12 will be ideal for keeping the five - bedroom home spick and span			2
he lives there with wife @entity16 , their four children and four - year - old cocker spaniel , @entity19 , spick and span			2
‘ it ’s got attachments so you can get down the sofa and clear dog hairs , and it will do any surface , carpets or tiling			0
in my opinion , the @entity22 is so good i ’ll also be bringing it to work to use it on the cars			0
’ in a blow to families and pet owners who value powerful vacuums for making house cleaning quick and easy , a @entity5 directive banning cleaners of more than 1,600 watts came into force this week in an attempt to reduce energy use			1
the @entity1 teamed up with @entity22 to offer readers an exclusive 50 per cent off two top @entity22 vacuum cleaners – the @entity58 , which mr @entity11 ordered , for £ 74.99 including postage ( normally £ 149.99 ) , or the @entity60 for £ 99.99 including postage ( normally £ 199.99 )			1
both the models originally on offer sold out within just five hours			0
but today we are offering two different high - powered models to readers ( see offer below )			1
mr @entity11 said : ‘ we wanted a high - power vacuum cleaner and every one of my generation knows @entity22 are a good product so as soon as we saw the offer in the @entity1 we knew it was the one for us			1
last saturday 's @entity1 story on new @entity5 directive banning high - powered vacuum cleaners ‘ i can not understand why the ban is coming in			1
with a high - powered one like this you use it once a week and get the job done properly			1
with lower powered models you end up using them maybe three or four times a week to get the same result			2
’ mrs @entity83 , 44 , works as a service adviser for another car dealership , so fitting in efficient housework in limited time between work is essential for the busy couple			0
three of their children – @entity91 , 18 , @entity92 , 15 , and @entity93 , 12 – still live at home full - time , while the fourth , @entity95 , 20 , is at university			0
another to take advantage of our promotion was @entity100 , 86 , of @entity101 , @entity102 , who opted for the upright @entity60 model			0
the grandmother said : ‘ i ’ve had @entity110 since 1949 , they are reliable and you need the power to do a good job			0
i would n’t be without one			0
’ the @entity5 ban led to a stampede to buy powerful vacuum cleaners in shops this with week , with retailers reporting a fourfold surge in sales			1
retailers can continue selling stock until it runs out but they can not import more and manufacturers can no longer make them			0
from next year the @entity5 ban will extend to vacuums cleaners of 900 watts as well .			2

new @entity5 **law** means vacuum cleaners with more than 1,600 watts are banned
ruling , aimed at reducing energy use , led to stampede of buyers this week
many used @entity1 promotion to save money on high - powered hoovers
one of them - businessman , @entity11 , of @entity25 , says new **law** does not make sense as low - powered machines require more frequent use
