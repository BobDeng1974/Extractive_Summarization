a dog owner is considering taking legal action against the veterinary clinic that surgically removed her pug 's cut eye without her permission			1
@entity6 took her 13 - year - old pug named @entity8 to the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 after noticing a cloudiness in the dog 's left eye			1
a veterinarian diagnosed the issue as an abrasion to the eye and recommended @entity6 get the eye removed for $ 1,400 ; treat it with a skin graft for $ 3,000 or drops			1
@entity6 chose the least - painful route for @entity8 and the two were sent home with three different eye drops and two oral medications			1
' around noon , i get a phone call and the girl on the phone says , " i just want you to know , @entity8 is doing well			2
she 's recovering well from surgery			0
" ' @entity6 told @entity49 13			2
i think i stopped breathing for a minute , ' she recalled			0
' i was like , " excuse me ? what are you talking about ? she 's supposed to be there for a follow up			0
" ' when @entity6 dropped her dog off at the veterinarian 's office that day , she even filled out paper work writing that it was simply a follow - up appointment and that she must be called for all procedures over $ 5 dollars			1
while she was warned on the phone about her dog 's condition , it was not enough to prepare @entity6 for what she saw when she later picked up @entity8			1
' as soon as he brought her in the room , i completely broke down			0
she immediately recognized my voice and came right to me			0
jumped up , wanted to be in my lap and curled up into a ball , ' @entity6 said			0
@entity8 continues to struggle getting used to life with just one eye , her owner says , adding that she is considering suing the clinic			1
reportedly , the clinic at first left @entity6 with the bill for the treatment but are now going to pay for the procedure			2
@entity6 filled out paperwork before dropping off her dog , marking that it was only a follow - up visit she also wrote that she should be contacted for any procedures over $ 5 they have since issued a statement on their error			1
' at @entity88 , we are committed to partnering with clients in all decisions regarding their pet 's care			0
in the instance of @entity8 , although the care provided was medically necessary based on the severity of her condition and lack of response to therapy , we did fail to get surgical authorization from the client on the day of the procedure , ' @entity88 client advocate @entity93 said			0
' however , we had previously discussed the need for surgery with the client â€” we also communicated that surgery was critical to alleviate @entity8 's pain and potential for infection			2
we apologize for the lack of clear communication and will continue to attempt to reach ms. @entity6 in an effort to further resolve her concerns			0
in the meantime , we wish @entity8 a speedy recovery			0
' one - eyed : @entity6 says @entity8 is still getting used to life with one eye , and sometimes bumps into objects around her			1

@entity6 took her 13 - year - old pug @entity8 to a @entity122 for a follow - up appointment about an abrasion on the dog 's eye
she later returned to find that a veterinarian had removed the eye without first calling to ask for permission
@entity6 is now considering legal action against the clinic
