by @entity0 published : 11:39 est , 21 may 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 21 may 2013 the @entity3 army doctor awaiting trial for a gun attack that killed 13 fellow soldiers and injured 32 , has been paid $ 278,000 since the shooting on november 5 , 2009			1
soldiers injured in the horrific attack at the @entity11 army base are fighting to receive the same pay and medical benefits as those injured in combat , but the @entity16 confirmed that @entity17 has continued to be paid			1
the @entity18 said that under the @entity20 , unless @entity17 is found guilty , his salary can not be suspended			1
army specialist @entity21 , who was shot three times at the @entity23 , is appalled that the accused gunman is still being paid			0
appalled : @entity21 , who was shot at @entity3 , and his wife @entity26 now struggle to pay for groceries ' there have been times when my wife and i can not afford groceries			0
we can not afford gas in our car , ' mr @entity21 , who has since retired , said			0
' this makes me sick			0
' if the army psychiatrist had been a civilian employee at the base , the @entity18 could have suspended his pay after only one week , @entity37 said			1
personnel rules for most civilian government workers allow for ' indefinite suspensions ' in cases ' when the agency has reasonable cause to believe that the employee has committed a crime for which a sentence of imprisonment may be imposed '			0
the continued salary is just one of several battles victims of the shooting are fighting			1
because the @entity18 classified the shooting as workplace violence rather than being combat related , and refuses to call it a terrorist attack , the gunman 's victims have been denied benefits they would ordinarily be entitled to			1
trial : army psychiatrist @entity17 will be tried for 13 specifications of premeditated murder under the combat related classification , servicemen would be entitled to the pay , @entity68 retirement and medical benefits afforded to soldiers wounded in war , or during the 9/11 attacks on the @entity16			1
this means that mr @entity21 , who had been due to go to @entity74 before the shooting , and the other victims and their families , are missing out of thousands of dollars in benefits and pay each year			1
on the third anniversary of the shooting , victims filed a lawsuit against the @entity18 to try to win back the rights to the benefits they claim they are entitled to			1
mr @entity21 was appalled when he was shown a letter from the @entity16 confirming @entity17 had been paid more than $ 278,000			2
the letter was a response to a request by @entity89 under the @entity90			0
mr @entity21 , who now lives in @entity91 , said : ' i honestly thought i was going to die in that building			0
' the former reservist , who needed to undergo surgery several times and still suffers from post-traumatic stress , said the attack was like being in combat			2
help : @entity18 medical staff treat their fellow servicemen who were shot in the attack at the @entity11 base ' you take three rounds and lose five good friends and watch seven other people get killed in front of you			1
do you have another term that we can classify that as ? ' he said			0
his wife , @entity26 , told @entity89 : ' they do n't need to be treated like this			0
they do n't need to sit and fight every day for this benefit or that			0
' @entity117 , who was shot six times and still has two of the bullets lodged in his body said : ' it was no different than an insurgent in @entity74 or @entity124 trying to kill us			0
' he estimated that the ‘ workplace violence ’ classification has cost him almost $ 70,000 in benefits that would have been available if his injuries were classified as ‘ combat related '			1
‘ basically , they 're treating us like i was downtown and i got hit by a car , ’ he told @entity132			0
the victims are being supported in their fight by @entity139 congressman @entity139			2
' we 're giving the defendant in this case every benefit of the doubt			0
but yet we 're not giving the benefits to the victims , ' mr @entity139 , a former @entity3 prosecutor , said			2
he has signed a bi-partisan letter urging defense secretary @entity147 to reclassify the attack as combat related , adding that the situation has ' resulted in an embarrassing lack of care and treatment for the victims and their families '			2
' what happened here was an attack on our military by a terrorist element specifically targeting our military , ' mr @entity139 , who represents @entity156 said			0
grief : the family of @entity165 visit a memorial for the 19 - year - old who was one of the @entity3 victims the campaigner for veterans ' rights added that he would be willing to consider whether @entity173 should update its rules so that the army could suspend the pay of soldiers accused of harming their fellow servicemen			0
one of the police officers who helped stop the gunman , said : ' we 've asked for the incident to be reclassified from “ workplace violence , ” of all things , to what it was , which was a terroristic attack			1
' sgt @entity188 , who has since been laid off from her job at the base , says the victims have been forgotten by those who promised to care for them			0
@entity197 reports showed @entity17 was communicating with @entity198 before to the shooting			2
the @entity200 also lists the @entity3 shooting as a ' high fatality terrorist attack '			0
the @entity18 turned down further requests from @entity204 about @entity17 's pay and the classification of the shooting			1
its @entity207 said : ' the @entity16 is committed to the integrity of the ongoing court martial proceedings of @entity17 and for that reason will not further characterize , at this time , the incident that occurred at @entity3 on nov. 5 , 2009			2
' it is possible for the @entity18 to recuperate some of @entity17 's salary if it demands that he pays for his medical costs after being shot by a police officer			1
it is not yet clear if the army will do this			0
forgotten : families say the needs of victims have been ignored because of how the attack was classified it is not the first time that @entity17 's salary has been highlighted			1
in july 2010 @entity225 closed his account and the doctor struggled to find another financial institution willing to accept his army pay , according to @entity230			0
@entity231 , his civilian attorney , said he and his staff tried to open accounts in @entity17 's name at several banks but were turned down			2
earlier this year , an army spokesman said any government declaration that @entity17 is a terrorist could mean a delay of another ' year or more ' in a trial which has already been pushed back several times by lengthy debates over @entity17 's beard and other side issues			1
' such an unprecedented action would thwart the real and lasting measure that will bring closure to the grieving and harmed victims , the trial itself , ' the @entity18 concluded			1
@entity17 , who had been due to work in @entity124 at the time of the attack , faces the death penalty if convicted by a military jury on 13 specifications of premeditated murder			1
the @entity259 , who is now paralyzed from the waist down , is due to go on trial later this year .			2

@entity18 still pays salary to @entity17 , who is due to go on trial over @entity11 shootings
victims of attack , classified as ' workplace violence ' denied benefits
