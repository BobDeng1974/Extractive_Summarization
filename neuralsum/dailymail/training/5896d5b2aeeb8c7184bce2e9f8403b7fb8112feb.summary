by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 20:47 est , 22 november 2012 for more than a century and a half the simple symmetry of these former almshouses had remained an undisturbed gem			0
but that was before the unstoppable march of multi-coloured wheelie bins reached their village			1
the elderly residents of the historic terrace were shocked by the arrival of not one but three bins for each cottage – a total of 21 for the row – as well as two smaller indoor bins each , including an orange ‘ caddy ’ for waste food			1
new delivery : the wheelie bins were lined up outside these attractive cottages on @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24 by the local council they claimed that the bins blocked off wheelchairs , ambulances and even the postman – as well as marring the @entity32 mock gothic architecture			1
unsightly : each of the seven cottages received five bins , making 35 in total since they first rolled into @entity23 , @entity24 , earlier this month , however , the majority have mysteriously vanished			1
@entity24 council said it had not removed them			0
yesterday residents complained that those which remain outside @entity22 are still an eyesore and a hazard			2
‘ i can hardly breathe , never mind move bins around , ’ said 77 - year - old @entity44			2
' some of the neighbours had to come round and move the bins away from my front door because i could n’t get out , and i ca n’t use the back door because of my disability			0
and the ambulance comes here a lot and parks outside , but there is no way an ambulance can get here now			0
’ mr @entity44 , who has a severe heart problem and only one lung , said his 90 - year - old neighbour was ‘ nearly in tears ’ at the situation			0
fire hazard : the bins were delivered straight in front of the cottages , blocking some of the elderly residents in their homes how it looked before : one of the idyllic cottages on @entity22 in @entity23 in @entity24 before the delivery of wheelie bins ‘ she was so worried about what she was going to do with all these bins , ’ he said			1
the cottages were built as almshouses in the mid- 19th century , and are still offered to pensioners at affordable rents			0
their rubbish was previously collected in bags , but now each cottage has three wheelie bins collected fortnightly - a black one for general rubbish , a blue one for recyclables and a green one for garden waste .			2

@entity91 delivered 35 wheelie bins for just seven cottages
elderly residents of @entity23 left unable to leave their homes
recycling initiative for *11,000* homes but residents call the bins ' *ludicrous* '
