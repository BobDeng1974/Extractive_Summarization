@entity0 has upped his @entity2 takeover bid to £ 20million and offered the crisis - hit club a £ 6.5m emergency loan to help keep it afloat in the meantime			1
the @entity8 financier had an £ 18m offer rejected on tuesday despite the @entity11 board announcing it was dangerously short on cash			1
now the owner of @entity15 side the @entity16 says he is willing to provide cash to pay off loans already taken out in recent weeks if the club accepts his new revised offer			1
@entity16 owner and financier @entity0 has increased his @entity2 takeover bid to £ 20million @entity0 failed in his bid to buy a controlling stake of the @entity11 club after offering £ 18m he also hinted he would be willing to continue working with former oldco director @entity26 and the @entity27 - wealthy fans @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity31 - who have both bought significant stakes in the past week			1
in a statement given to the @entity35 , the 53 - year - old @entity0 said : ' this revised proposal hopefully helps the board deal with its short - term cashflow crunch and also addresses my desire to see the club on a solid long - term financial footing			2
' it would also enable @entity2 to repay the loans from @entity45 and @entity46 , and free it of debt			0
@entity0 also offers a £ 6.5m emergency loan to the cash - strapped club to pay off debts in the short term ' i know , of course , that there are various groups of prominent fans who have been working hard for a long time to bring change to the club and they can rest assured that , if my proposal is accepted , i am committed to building a strong partnership with fans and key stakeholders to do what is best for the club			1
' i look forward to receiving the response of the @entity2 board			2
' @entity0 wants to buy a majority shareholding in the club , who require £ 8.3million by april 1 to stay in business , by way of new shares and will then make a bid to buy out the remaining shareholders at 20p a share			2
@entity0 says the cash loan ' addresses my desire to see the club on a solid long - term financial footing ' the ceo of the usd 10 billion @entity83 has already provided proof of funds to the club , although their stock exchange statement notes that ' there can be no certainty that any offer will be made '			2
however , it still remains unlikely that he will be able to get the support needed to have his bid accepted			0
the @entity2 board voted down its own resolution nine at the last month 's @entity96 , which would have allowed it to issue fresh shares to new investors without first offering them to existing stakeholders			1
any move to issue fresh equity , therefore , requires 75 per cent shareholder approval , but , with @entity26 and the @entity103 now in control of around 34 per cent and determined to protect the club for the fans , that may prove too great a hurdle			0
the @entity45 factor could also remain decisive with the @entity110 owner positioned strongly at @entity11 after placing his associates @entity111 and @entity113 onto the board			0
rangers have yet to repay the £ 3million loan the @entity118 tycoon gave the club last year while he has also tightened his grip on the club 's retail division			0
however , @entity0 insists he will provide a steady stream of cash to the club if his bid is successful			0
@entity26 bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club this month and is keen to protect the club for the fans in an additional statement issued by his @entity131 media relations advisor , he said : ' if the board agrees to my proposal , i would provide a total of £ 16.4million to £ 20 million to be invested in the club as the board determines - £ 6.5m immediately and the remainder following a share issue , taking the major step necessary to restore financial stability to the club			1
' @entity0 , who was alerted to the situation at @entity11 by former @entity145 defender @entity144 , added : ' i know , of course , that there are various groups of prominent fans who have been working hard for a long time to bring change to the club and they can rest assured that i am committed to building a strong partnership with fans and key stakeholders to do what is best for the club			1
' i fully realise that a strong sports club needs local investment , local directors and local support to be successful			0
@entity110 owner @entity45 is positioned strongly at the club after placing his associates @entity111 and @entity113 on the board - @entity2 are yet to pay back the £ 3m loan he gave last year ' i 've received messages of support from many @entity2 fans and really appreciate their good wishes - even if sometimes i do n't immediately get their @entity131 sense of humour ! ' after everything they have been through in recent years , i understand some are rightly cautious about a guy they 've never heard of wanting to get involved in their club			1
i 'd feel exactly the same way			0
' but hopefully i can combine my financial resources and knowledge of professional sport with strong local leaders and top - notch management to bring @entity2 back to elite level			0
' meanwhile , @entity2 have also confirmed they have repaid the £ 500,000 loan issued by @entity185 on monday after @entity186 paid the first instalment on their £ 850,000 purchase of midfielder @entity189 .			0

@entity2 board turned down @entity0 's £ 18m takeover bid
@entity8 financier and @entity16 owner also offers cash to pay off debts
club running risk of financial ruin if no *suitable* solution is found
