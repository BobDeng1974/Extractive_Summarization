by @entity0 published : 07:35 est , 27 february 2014 @entity2 : 08:51 est , 27 february 2014 experts say new @entity5 diagnosis guidelines could reduce the number of diagnoses of autism by a third new diagnosis guidelines for autism could reduce the number of people diagnosed by a third , researchers have claimed			1
the @entity5 ( @entity5 ) released the guidelines in may 2013 and experts have now argued that the changes could leave thousands of children in the @entity18 without a diagnosis			1
this means they would not be able to access educational support or social support			1
researchers at @entity25 , in @entity26 , conducted a literature review to determine the effect of changes to the @entity30			0
the study revealed that there is a 31 per cent fall in diagnoses when the new guidelines are used			1
‘ this study raises a concern that a medical provider diagnosing a child under the new guidelines wo n't find the child to be on the autism spectrum , when the same child under the old criteria might have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity35			2
the old manual included three distinct subgroups under the broad definition of autism spectrum disorder – autistic disorder , @entity51 ’s disorder and pervasive development disorder - not otherwise specified			0
the revised manual eliminates these subgroups , instead establishing a more limited range of criteria for a diagnosis of autism that is designed to encompass individuals who previously would have fallen into one of the subgroups			2
however , the new manual does include a new category - called social communication disorder - to diagnose individuals who have communication difficulties but lack other attributes associated with autism			2
when using the new manual , there was a 22 per cent fall in the number of people diagnosed with autistic disorder and a 70 per cent fall in the number of diagnosis of pervasive development disorder - not otherwise specified			0
however , there was no notable decline in the number of people diagnosed with @entity51 ’s disorder			0
‘ we are potentially going to lose diagnosis and treatment for some of the most vulnerable kids who have developmental delays , ’ said dr @entity35			0
the researchers say the guidelines could leave thousands of children without the diagnosis they need to access educational and social support ‘ in many instances , children require a diagnosis of @entity92 to receive medical benefits , educational support and social services			1
the new guidelines are not thought to have a significant impact on diagnosis in the @entity99			1
@entity100 , director of the @entity102 's @entity101 , said : ' whilst the @entity30 is very influential , it is not the main set of criteria used in the @entity99 , so we do n’t expect that there will be any immediate changes to the way that autism and asperger syndrome are diagnosed in this country			1
' the removal of the term asperger syndrome is concerning for some people who view the term as part of their identity and use it in their day to day vocabulary			0
the changes wo n’t prevent people from continuing to use the term to define themselves and nor should it			0
@entity102 says the guidelines are very important but that they are not the main tool used to make autism diagnoses in the @entity99 ' all individuals who currently have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum , including those with @entity51 , will retain their diagnosis			1
' people with autism tend to have difficulties with communication , to misread facial expressions , and to have difficulty making friends			0
they may also be heavily reliant on routines , extremely sensitive to changes in their environment , and intensely focused on interests not appropriate to the social context they are in			0
symptoms vary in severity , and early diagnosis and access to treatment have been proven to result in better outcomes .			2

@entity5 has released new diagnosis guidelines
experts say they could leave thousands of children without a diagnosis
this means they will not be able to access social and educational support
in the @entity99 , the guidelines are seen as important but they are not the main tool used to make autism diagnoses
