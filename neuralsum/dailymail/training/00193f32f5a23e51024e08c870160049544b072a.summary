@entity1 prime minister @entity0 has blasted the @entity3 administration for bringing the world to the brink of ' a second @entity6 that nobody needs			1
' in a videotaped interview published tuesday , he told @entity10 that ' we are slowly but surely approaching a second cold war , ' in part because president @entity3 ' could be more tactful politically			2
' seated at his private residence outside @entity15 and speaking through an @entity17 translator , @entity0 blasted @entity3 for leveling sanctions at the @entity1 government and its wealthiest oligarchs			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity0 blasted the @entity3 administration -- with a smile ! -- for bringing the world to the brink of ' a second @entity6 that nobody needs ' nerves fraying : @entity1 claims it has withdrawn troops from near the @entity27 border , but tank commanders at checkpoints are still standing guard naive ? @entity1 foreign minister @entity31 pressed a red prop ' reset button ' along with then - @entity35 secretary of state @entity34 in march 2009 , but the two countries ' relations are now at a @entity38 low ' let 's be honest : those sanctions are a sharp knife for @entity44 business , ' he claimed			1
' and @entity35 business does n't need them either			0
the only ones who want sanctions are politicians , who use them to reinforce their convictions and demonstrate their power			0
' and in a mafia - like jab , the @entity1 legislative leader hinted that if he wanted to , he could push back against @entity35 sanctions			1
' you 've probably noticed that we have not commented on them a great deal or responded to them harshly , ' he told @entity10 reporter @entity63 , ' although we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions			2
' asked about the now - infamous ' reset button ' effort that he co-engineered with then - secretary of state @entity34 in march 2009 , @entity0 said the @entity3 administration has unraveled any @entity1 good will that may have existed five years ago			1
' yes , i believe that president @entity3 could be more tactful politically when discussing those issues , ' he said			2
' some decisions taken by the @entity35 administration are disappointing			0
' pressure : @entity1 president @entity77 joined with @entity79 president @entity78 ( r ) to oversee joint naval exercises on tuesday as the two powers seek to build ties in the face of @entity85 criticism and territorial disputes @entity0 hinted at repercussions for @entity35 economic sanctions , saying that ' we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions ' ' we have indeed done a lot for @entity1 - @entity35 relations			1
i believe doing so was right			0
the agreements that we reached with @entity35 were useful			0
and i 'm very sorry that everything that has been achieved is now being eliminated by those [ @entity35 ] decisions			2
' ' basically , ' he claimed , ' we are slowly but surely approaching a second @entity6 that nobody needs			0
why am i saying this ? because a competent politician knows how to make reserved , careful , subtle , wise and intelligent decisions â€“ which , i believe , mr @entity3 succeeded at for a while			1
' ' but what is being done now , unfortunately , proves that the @entity106 has run out of these resources			0
and the @entity35 is one of the parties to suffer from this			0
' @entity0 's interview came as the @entity35 was still seeking ' firm evidence ' to support @entity1 's claim that it has withdrawn soldiers from the borders of @entity27			1
@entity27 is gearing up for an election to replace former president @entity117 , who fled to @entity1 in february after months of street protests			2
@entity1 's relations with the @entity35 and @entity120 are at a @entity38 low following @entity15 's seizure of @entity123 .			0

@entity0 blasted @entity3 for not ' know [ ing ] how to make reserved , careful , subtle , wise and intelligent decisions '
a more ' competent politician , ' he said , would n't have *slapped* @entity1 with economic sanctions after it marched across the @entity27 border
' we probably could cause some unpleasantries for the country that imposes those sanctions , ' he hinted in a moment ripe for @entity136
the interview came as state - run tv reported that @entity1 soldiers near @entity27 are standing down and *returning* to their bases
