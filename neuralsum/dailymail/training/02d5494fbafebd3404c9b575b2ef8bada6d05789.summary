@entity0 ended friday practice in ominous form after clocking a time over half - a - second quicker than title rival @entity4			1
@entity4 had the measure of @entity6 in the day 's opening session , but the @entity8 responded in emphatic fashion on friday afternoon finishing 0.6secs clear of his team - mate			1
the session was suspended on two occasions after pastor @entity14 lost control of his @entity16 before crashing into the barriers , while @entity19 's @entity18 also spun			1
@entity14 was taken to the on - track medical centre for precautionary checks and was given the all - clear			2
reigning world champion @entity23 was forced to sit out the session with an exhaust problem			2
life in the fast lane : @entity0 was an impressive 0.6seconds clear of title rival @entity4 he 's done it again : the session was red - flagged after pastor @entity14 lost control of his @entity16 mess : the @entity16 mechanics will face a race against time to put @entity14 's car back together for qualifying 1			1
@entity46 1:51.077 @entity0 , 11 points adrift of @entity35 team - mate @entity4 with eight races remaining , conjured a time of one minute 49.189 seconds for the seven - kilometre @entity52 circuit			1
@entity4 had edged @entity0 in @entity53 by a mere 0.097secs as @entity56 's medium - compound rubber - the slightly slower tyre this weekend - took centre stage			1
but come the soft - tyre runs in @entity60 , @entity0 crushed @entity4 , who ran wide on one of his final hot - lap attempts , scattering gravel over the renowned track			1
@entity65 's @entity36 was third quickest in both sessions , at least suggesting a podium is on the cards on sunday even if both @entity35 run reliably , which has not been the case of late			2
driving seat : @entity0 heads into this weekend 's @entity73 @entity72 11 points adrift of team - mate @entity4 @entity36 was three quarters of a second down on @entity6 , and the only other driver to finish within a second of the 29 - year - old @entity8			1
@entity37 , considerably off the pace in @entity53 but suggesting they had far more in the tank as they are expected to be @entity35 ' closest rivals this weekend , showed a little more of their hand in @entity60			0
@entity37 was fourth fastest , but 1.138secs in arrears , with team - mate @entity40 a further two places and 0.340secs adrift			0
sandwiched in between the @entity37 pair , and suggesting @entity38 are edging ever slowly towards respectability , was @entity39 , albeit with the 34 - year - old nearly 1.5secs down			0
off the pace : @entity4 was over half - a - second slower than team - mate @entity0 in the second session @entity42 's @entity41 and the only driver other than @entity4 or @entity0 to win a race this season in @entity44 's @entity43 were seventh and eighth , the latter 1.8secs back			1
as for @entity43 's four - time champion team - mate @entity23 , the @entity96 suffered more technical misery this season as he sat out the entire second session due to his car requiring a power - unit change , so finishing at the bottom of the standings without a time to his name			0
he completed only 11 laps in the morning session			0
@entity38 's @entity45 and @entity108 in his @entity109 completed the top 10 , both just under two seconds off the pace			0
@entity65 's @entity112 was a lowly 15th , albeit seeming to focus on long - run pace than outright speed as he finished 2.3secs behind team - mate @entity36			2
back on board : @entity117 took over from @entity118 but was 1.3seconds adrift of @entity120 @entity121 's @entity117 , on thursday out of a drive due to what the team claimed were ' contractual issues ' but reinstated following a ' change of circumstances ' , was 18th			0
@entity117 had sat out @entity128 in favour of reserve @entity118 , who appeared poised to become the first @entity131 for seven years to race in a gp			0
back behind the wheel of his car again , the 23 - year - old @entity8 was five seconds behind @entity0 and 1.3secs off team - mate @entity120			2
the @entity135 duo of @entity136 and @entity137 were 19th and 20th , split by just 0.043secs			0
three - times @entity138 24 hours winner @entity137 , making his debut at the age of 32 and 12 years after his only previous @entity143 experience with @entity144 as a reserve , has replaced @entity146 , apparently for this race only .			0

@entity0 was 0.6secs quicker than title rival @entity4 in second session
@entity152 @entity36 was best of the rest in his @entity65
pastor @entity14 lost control of his lotus ; the session was red flagged
