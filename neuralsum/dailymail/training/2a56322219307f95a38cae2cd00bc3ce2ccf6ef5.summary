@entity9 , 56 , was sentenced to death in january after being caught carrying 10.6lb of cocaine worth £ 1.6million into the holiday island from @entity13 in may last year			1
a just giving online fund set up by supporters has raised only a third of the £ 8,000 she needs to take her case to @entity20 ’s @entity19 after a lower court rejected her appeal			1
knitting : @entity9 , 56 , was sentenced to death in january after being caught carrying 10.6lb of cocaine worth £ 1.6million into the holiday island from @entity13 in may last year the government has refused to fund her fight to avoid the firing squad and will today contest a second @entity31 bid by the anti-death penalty campaign group @entity32 to make it foot the legal bill			1
in an open letter written from her cell , @entity9 admits she has been ‘ stupid ’ and says she has ‘ humiliated ’ @entity2 and herself			2
she writes : ‘ i have been told the government ’s position when it comes to @entity2 citizens in my position ( is ) that i or my supporters must raise the funds for my defence , and that the longer i am on death row the more time i have in which to do this			2
’ @entity9 says foreign minister @entity48 , who rejected her plea for financial help , is ‘ living in cloud cuckoo land ’			2
desperate : @entity9 co-operated with police after she was held at @entity53 in a sting operation that led to the arrest of four other suspects she adds : ‘ my family has done all they possibly can to support me and nobody could ask anyone to do more			2
i myself am knitting a jumper that i will try to auction to raise money , but that ’s not going to go far			0
’ while she accepts she was to blame for her plight , she says prisoners on trial in @entity2 at least have a legal aid system to help them			0
she says she had been ‘ touched and humbled by the kindness of so many members of the @entity2 public , who have reached into their own pockets in difficult times to help me pay for a lawyer , when the @entity2 government would n’t help me ’			0
however , @entity9 may not be able to lodge her appeal with the @entity19 before thursday ’s deadline if she is unable to raise the £ 8,000 needed to pay her legal costs			1
she adds : ‘ the last appeal cost about £ 2,600			0
this time , in the @entity19 , it will be about £ 8,000			1
if i really were a rich drug dealer , it would be no big deal			0
but i ’m not , and you might as well ask me to pay ten million dollars			0
‘ i know there are some people who think i should die here in this prison cell			0
if i should die – and i hope i do n’t , but i fear i may – then i hope my execution will prompt the @entity2 government to do more for others			0
’ @entity9 co-operated with police after she was held at @entity53 in a sting operation that led to the arrest of four other suspects , including @entity2 @entity9 , @entity9 and @entity9			2
however , while @entity9 was sentenced to the death penalty , the other suspects – believed by police to be higher up in the drug smuggling syndicate – had charges of trafficking dropped and were given jail terms of between one and six years			1
the @entity100 , while refusing to fund @entity9 ’s appeal , gave a written submission to her appeal hearing arguing that the death penalty she received was excessive and unjust			1
former director of public prosecutions @entity103 said the discrepancy in sentencing was ‘ bizarre and unfathomable ’ .			0
