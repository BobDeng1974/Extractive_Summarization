by @entity0 newly declassified documents have revealed that the @entity3 military was not ready to deal with an imminent threat in @entity5 on the night of the 2012 attack because they always operated under the assumption that host countries would protect diplomatic forces for a few hours attack should an attack occur			1
the hundreds of pages of declassified material are transcripts of hearings held by the @entity16 in the wake of the fatal attack that left ambassador @entity19 and three others dead in the early hours of september 12			1
a general and top members of the @entity22 revealed that while they relied heavily on the understanding that @entity25 forces would come to the @entity3 consulate ’s aid for long enough to scramble jets from other bases in the @entity30 , they also did little to prepare for the anniversary of the september 11th terror attacks			1
chaos : the @entity16 has released hundreds of pages of transcripts from hearings about the security preparedness - or lack thereof - leading up to the september 11 , 2012 attack on the @entity39 in @entity5 ‘ we actually did an analysis of since 9/11 of 2001 , how many attacks that we have actually had on 9/11 , the anniversary of 9/11			1
the answer is one , and it was september 11 of 2012 , ’ major general @entity41 told the committee in a hearing on may 21 , 2013			0
‘ prior to that event at @entity5 , there had not been an attack on 9/11 that ( the @entity22 ) had to respond to in any way			1
‘ what we thought , which turned out tragically unreliable , was that the @entity25 security force would provide a defense of our diplomats , as is done around the world everywhere , and that failed			1
’ adding to the scramble was the fact that the closest team that could theoretically fly in to help the security forces at the @entity5 compound was in @entity63			2
two people from that six - person team were immediately dispatched to @entity5 while the rest stayed in @entity63 to maintain a secure presence there , said @entity68 , the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low - intensity conflict			1
‘ we did n't have a tactical setting to say let 's get a military force in there now , ’ mr @entity68 told the committee			0
expert opinion : major general @entity41 told the committee that earlier security analysis told @entity22 officials that september 11 was not a day that was picked for a terrorist attack except in 2001 , meaning that an increase of security was not necessarily justified on that specific date ‘ by the time our forces were in a position to be able to get into @entity25 and to do something everything was coming out of @entity5 , everybody was retrograding to @entity63			1
and so we were working on getting the wounded out			0
we knew by then that the @entity19 was dead , and that he was on his way from the hospital to the airfield			2
’ aside from that six - man @entity95 team in @entity63 , there were no f - 16 fighter planes anywhere near the @entity25 attack zones and the closest air refuellers that could ready other , closer planes were in @entity101 - a 10 - hour flight away			1
the logistics of the developing attack also prompted hesitation on commanders ’ parts because even if there was a plane ready to send in an attack drone or drop mortar fire on the terrorists because the targets were not clear			2
‘ we did n't know who was friendly and who was enemy , ’ major general @entity41 said , going on to defend his commander , general @entity116 who is in charge of @entity3 forces throughout the @entity120 continent			2
unprepared : @entity68 , the principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for special operations and low - intensity conflict , said that there was no system in place that would allow @entity22 officials to send support immediately ' there was no way that we would have been able to drop weapons in that environment , from a drone or from an airplane			1
all of this , given this environment , was considered by @entity138 and dismissed fairly quickly			0
and personally , from my experience , i believe his decision was correct			0
’ one of the first fixes that was identified in the aftermath of the attack was a lack of marine security guards on the premises , and major general @entity41 said that the @entity22 had ' made a commitment to increase the coverage ' in light of the attack			1
' they are not going to be out on the perimeter chasing bad guys down the street , they are defending the hard line , they are defending within our secure areas , defending our people , defending our diplomatic facilities , ' he described			0
dozens of pages of testimony remain redacted in the files , released today by the @entity16			0
the hearings were done behind closed doors , as they gave the elected officials a chance to ask questions about the spread of military forces at the time of the attack			1
the volatility of the region - in light of the toppling of @entity182 's regime months before - led to examinations of the security of the @entity3 consulate , including one spearheaded by ambassador @entity19			1
the members of the @entity16 concluded that the ambassador 's suggestions would have come too late , as the terrorists struck before he had time to make the reforms			2
' i know the ambassador had an effort in place to strengthen and have a diplomatic presence			0
it was n't full - time			0
and to that he lost his life			0
no pretense that this is a full on operation on the diplomatic side whatsoever , ' congressman @entity199 said			0
then - secretary of state @entity204 was questioned - by both the @entity16 and @entity205 - in a far more public display that led her to scream at accusations that the @entity208 did not do enough by failing to question other evacuees as they left @entity25 in the days following the attack			1
‘ we had four dead @entity3 ! whether it was attack preplanned by terrorists or it because of a guy out for a walk one night who decided they 'd go kill @entity3 - what difference at this point does it make ? ! ’ mrs @entity204 responded at her late january hearing			2
angry : mrs @entity204 was extremely emotional throughout the nearly - three - hour - long hearing in january , which , unlike the hearings that were just declassified today , were televised the may 21 @entity16 hearings that were just declassified were part of a series that were held in order to try to ascertain what failings allowed a group of armed terrorists to breach the @entity3 consulate in @entity5			1
the uncertainty surrounding the chain of events was also another major point of contention as @entity16 officials blamed the attack on a video portraying @entity239 in a bad light			2
the attack was later determined to be a pre-planned event , though the investigation is ongoing and no arrests have been made to date			0
‘ it is a very dangerous world			0
and we are present in many parts of that dangerous world , ’ said congressman @entity245 , a ranking member of the @entity16 , during the may 21 hearing			0
‘ and also , we should remember that in the days before the @entity5 attacks , there were attacks on a number of our embassies that were , ironically , in fact inspired by a video , in @entity259 , in @entity260 ' a , in @entity261 , in @entity262 , and a lot of other places			0
the threat environment was very complex and very difficult			0

@entity16 held hearings about the security levels at the @entity3 consulate in @entity5 which have now been declassified
@entity22 officials revealed that there was no system in place to immediately dispatch extra support in the case of a *sudden* attack
normally depend on host country - in this case , @entity25 - to help defend @entity3 consulates in time of attack but ' that failed '
the fighter jets in nearby countries were all *unarmed* and needed to be refueled , but the nearest plane that could do that was in @entity101
@entity289 died in the 2012 attack including ambassador @entity19
