@entity3 , 37 , was left dangling in agony after he became impaled on a jagged spike near luxury flats in @entity6 's @entity16 on saturday morning			1
he spent the next 15 hours with a railing embedded in his leg while doctors worked out how to safely remove it			1
incredibly , this is not the first time mr @entity3 has impaled himself on an iron railing having been speared through the armpit at the age of five in a similar accident			1
he said : ' the funny thing is that i did do something similar when i was five			2
i was leaning against some railings near my home in order to get a better look at the nearby trainline and i just slipped			2
' that time i was able to free myself and i went home and told my mum that i had hurt my arm			2
' when she looked , there was a perfect hole in my armpit			1
i suppose i should have learned my lesson then			2
' during saturday 's incident , the railing was just inches from several major arteries and could have pierced a vital organ			1
but after a one - hour operation to remove it on sunday , mr @entity3 was back home on monday night			1
a fork - lift truck driver by day and dj by night , he got trapped in the car park after leaving a friend 's flat before deciding to scale the iron fence			1
he said : ' i was a bit drunk and i just took a look at this fence and thought , " yeah , i can make that			2
" ' there was a wooden bit at 90 degrees to the fence so i got up on that first with the intention of leaping over but , obviously , i underestimated the gap			2
' at first i thought i had just caught myself on something			2
it was a bit like when toddlers fall over and it takes them a few seconds before they start to cry			0
' i did n’t feel anything until i looked down and saw what i 'd done			0
i could n’t believe what i was seeing , i just thought " oh no , you ’ve actually done it			0
" ' all smiles : mr @entity3 poses with two friends following surgery at @entity6 's @entity75 painful : the iron railing remained stuck in mr @entity3 's leg for 15 hours before doctors could operate to remove it several passers - by were alerted by mr @entity3 's cries for help			1
one man even helped to support him while they waited for assistance and then the paramedics took over			0
mr @entity3 said : ' at first it really hurt but i think after a while i got used to it because i remember having a bit of a joke with this chap while he was trying to hold me up			1
' after that everything is a bit of a blur			0
the paramedics arrived and pumped me full of drugs so i could n’t feel anything			0
i was n’t even aware that they had set me on fire trying to get me off the fence			0
' he only heard later from friends that the extremely hot cutting tools used to remove the iron railing had set fire to a blanket used to keep his legs warm			1
however , he does remember a crowd forming around the scene as it took emergency workers around half an hour to release him from the fence			0
emergency crews were forced to call on the help of the @entity116 - who used hot gas cutting tools and an angle grinder to remove a section of the railings			0
the street was closed off as the emergency services carried out the rescue			0
dangerous : the metal spikes mr @entity3 attempted to scale on saturday morning emergency crews were forced to call on the help of the @entity116 - who used hot gas cutting tools and an angle grinder to remove a section of the railings once free , the mr @entity3 was placed on a stretcher and taken to hospital			1
he said : ' it ’s pretty embarrassing			0
i ’ll no doubt get some stick off my mates			0
' the accident happened at around 9am and it was midnight by the time i was taken into surgery , so i was laid on a hospital trolley with this big metal railing sticking out of my leg for a long time			1
' i did n’t feel much and i do n’t remember much because of all the drugs they had given me			0
the doctors said they were hopeful that the railing would come out pretty easily but they needed to be sure what kind of damage it had done			1
' mr @entity3 was discharged from @entity75 yesterday afternoon and , while his leg remains sore , he is still able to hobble about			1
however , he knows he has had a lucky escape			0
he said : ' it seems strange to say i ’m lucky to be alive but i suppose i am			0
it could easily have been much worse			0
i ’m just thankful there were people around to come to my aid quickly			0
' it ’s not bad - i can still get about and walk up and down the stairs and things			0
' close call : the horrifying incident happened near to @entity6 's @entity16 mr @entity3 's mother @entity163 said she only found out about her son 's latest scrape on sunday night as he had not wanted to worry her			1
@entity166 , 76 , said : ' @entity3 has always been very accident prone			1
i ca n’t believe he ’s been impaled on railings for the second time in his life			1
” ' a @entity171 spokesman said of the incident : ' crews arrived to find a man who had fallen onto a fence			0
the man had been impaled by one of the spikes of the fence into his thigh			1
' the spike remained in situ and was cut using specialist cutting equipment			2
