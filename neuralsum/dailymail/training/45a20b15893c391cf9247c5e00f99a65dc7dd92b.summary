it is the kind of talk @entity1 is trying to discourage			1
this almost unbreakable belief , among @entity5 ’s players , that not only will they create chances but that @entity7 will almost certainly take them			1
it is some position to be in at a @entity9			1
a source of confidence that must empower every member of the @entity5 squad			1
but @entity1 keeps stressing the need to be less reliant on their captain and inspiration and the chat among his players after securing safe passage to the last 16 , and an encounter with @entity22 in @entity23 next week , will do little to appease him			1
@entity25 spoke of two certainties in the life of this @entity5 team			1
firstly : ‘ that we ’re going to have two or three great chances to score every game			1
’ and secondly : ‘ that we ’ve got the best player in the world			1
’ vital : @entity7 has scored four goals for @entity5 already at the @entity9 @entity37 : @entity7 and @entity25 train for @entity5 at their base just outside @entity41 preparation : the @entity5 team are put through their paces at their @entity9 base @entity46 : @entity7 the four goals @entity7 has already scored in this tournament , the first two securing victory in their opening two group matches , would suggest @entity25 has a point			1
and in fairness to the @entity55 midfielder , he also acknowledged ‘ the need ’ for @entity5 ‘ to improve in other areas ’			1
but @entity58 echoed the view of his colleague on the remarkable @entity7			1
‘ well i think he ’s demonstrated it again , has n’t he ? ’ he said			1
‘ another great goal , he always pops up			1
’ true enough he does , with impressive frequency			1
but @entity66 , like @entity67 before them , exposed a degree of vulnerability at the opposite end of the field and @entity73 sees a fragile defence as @entity5 ’s ‘ weak link ’			1
‘ they can definitely be opened up , ’ said @entity78 ’s @entity77 international forward			1
‘ no disrespect but there is not much pace in the middle and the second - half showed that			2
‘ if you do n’t let them just play slowly from the back they are in trouble			2
the key to success against this team is to force them to kick it long			2
we did that , intercepted their long balls and went fast on the counter-attacks			2
off his chest : @entity25 addresses the media at a press conference at @entity5 's hq laughing and joking : @entity7 , @entity105 are all smiles during training breaking the news : team doctor @entity109 revealed @entity110 will miss the next game ‘ i think even @entity67 had success against @entity5 by doing that			1
we had seven , eight , nine shots we could have scored from today			2
‘ we also saw that when @entity5 played @entity117 ; how they played , there were chances for the opposition			1
defence is not the strongest part of their game			2
@entity67 could have scored a few so we went into this game knowing we could get goals			1
we got two and we could have had more			2
’ @entity1 describes his side as an ‘ offensive team ’ and @entity73 would not disagree			2
‘ the quality they have is all up front ’ he said			2
‘ the movement of @entity132 , @entity110 , @entity133 , who surprised us with long - range shots today , that is their strength			2
laid back : @entity7 and @entity138 relax on the training field in @entity41 full stretch : goalkeeper @entity141 tests his shot stopping skills ‘ but the defence , that ’s their weak link			2
the way they play , to get their results , they have to take the game to the other half of the pitch			0
they know they have to do that because if they play in their own half they are going to be in trouble			0
they are doing the right thing , playing too their strengths			0
’ an interesting debate emerged from the post-match interview area at the @entity161			0
@entity105 thought there was already evidence to suggest the @entity165 teams had an advantage because of the unique conditions in this part of the world			0
while @entity73 thought the decisive factor would simply be fitness			0
‘ it ’s not easy to play in @entity173 , ’ said @entity5 ’s @entity105			1
‘ i think now people are realising that			0
@entity178 here are more difficult			0
the pitches are not like they are in @entity180			0
they ’re drier , the climate is different , the time , there are lots of variables			0
the football is not played with the speed with which @entity180 teams are used to playing			0
maybe that suits the @entity165 teams more			0
hopefully those variables will favour the @entity165 teams because that would mean that we have a chance			0
although @entity192 are not @entity165 and they are playing very well			0
’ @entity194 set to miss @entity22 last - 16 clash thirsty work : former @entity198 star @entity197 finger pointing : @entity199 coach @entity1 test : @entity5 play @entity22 in the last 16 in @entity23 next week @entity73 had a different view			1
‘ any team can surprise anyone at this @entity9 , ’ he said			0
‘ my first impression from this tournament is that the fittest team will win it			0
if you do n’t let the opposition play and you are fit , you are going to get scoring opportunities			0
and if you are very fit you do n’t let them play			0
and that is the key to winning this @entity9			0
the second - halves are longer than you wish them to be here			0
’ whoever turns out to be right , @entity5 ’s players accept they must show more discipline at the back			1
‘ there ’s a lot to think about , ’ said @entity221 , who was not at his best in defence but did manage to score @entity5 ’s winning goal			1
‘ in defence we have to improve because they ’ve put two past us and that puts pressure on those up front			0
’ as for the man himself , he sounded a little more positive			0
‘ it ’s always good to win games at any level but there ’s much more to come , ’ said @entity7			0
his team - mates expect nothing less .			0

@entity243 forward has been *instrumental* in @entity5 's *progress*
