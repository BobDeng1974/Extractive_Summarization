a bull earmarked for slaughter because it is gay has been saved by @entity4 co-creator @entity3 as the terminal cancer sufferer continues to spend his $ 100million fortune on animal rights causes			1
@entity8 , an @entity10 bull in @entity11 , @entity10 , had been facing slaughter for being gay after a veterinarian declared his sexual orientation the reason he would n't breed			1
but when @entity4 co-creator @entity3 heard of his fate , he put up £ 5,000 to buy @entity18 and transport him to a sanctuary where he will now live out his natural life in peace			1
@entity3 , who is also a long - time vegan , said : ' @entity35 told me about @entity18 , and i felt compelled to help			2
all animals have a dire destiny in the meat trade , but to kill this bull because he 's gay would 've been a double tragedy			1
' it thrills me to help @entity35 and @entity44 make @entity8 's fate a sanctuary rather than a sandwich			2
' @entity3 was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2012 and has chosen to use his money and the time he has left to help animals in need			1
this includes getting 17 bears transferred from virtually barren concrete pits to a lush new home , helping retire a lame horse used for racing and securing the transfer of a chimpanzee who had spent more than 18 years in solitary confinement at a zoo to a reputable sanctuary			0
he also runs the @entity64 , an organisation dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating homeless dogs			0
given three months to live in 2012 , @entity3 immediately decided to team up with @entity35 ( @entity35 ) president @entity66 , and dedicate his time to the rescue of maltreated animals and conservation			2
creators of @entity4 @entity72 , @entity73 , and @entity3 ( right ) are interviewed about the hit show in the early 1990s @entity3 ( pictured centre ) with dogs rescued from a shelter that was not providing them with the care they needed - a venture he launched with @entity35 having defied that diagnosis ’ original death sentence , @entity3 continues to push ahead and has also funded projects such as ' @entity85 ' to help with the underprivileged in inner cities			1
and now , as he enters the twilight of his life , has declared himself never happier and finally at peace			2
@entity3 has no children and is not married so he wants to give his millions to causes he cares about			0
he was married to actress @entity93 in the 1980s but divorced in 1991 though they remain close			0
in addition to the money fronted by @entity3 , more than 250 other individuals have donated to fund the bull 's transfer via a crowd - funding initiative set up by @entity10 animal - protection group @entity44 and @entity101			1
@entity3 recently told @entity102 that @entity66 , the founder of @entity35 , created a ' therapy ' for him			0
' we planned and are still planning a series of animal liberations and actions that i get to participate in and enjoy			0
it gives me something to look forward			0
' i get to watch these animals that have been in concrete bunkers their whole lives take their first step on grass			0
