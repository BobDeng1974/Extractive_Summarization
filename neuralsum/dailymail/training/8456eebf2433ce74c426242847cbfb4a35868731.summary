by @entity0 published : 02:46 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 01:34 est , 26 june 2012 a 67 - year - old man has described the terrifying moment his boat started sinking off the coast of @entity4 after a collision with a whale so powerful that the stern of the 22 - ton vessel was lifted out of the water			1
@entity11 returned home to @entity13 on friday , ten days after the breaching whale slammed onto the bow of his 50 - foot boat during a solo voyage			1
mr @entity11 , was on the final leg of a journey from the @entity19 to @entity20 , @entity21 , when the 55 - foot - long whale hit the boat just after dark on june 12			1
' i could see its head			0
it must have been a young whale because he only had a few barnacles			0
' mr @entity11 was not hurt in the collision , but the steep angle of the boat sent him sliding down the deck toward a pile of sea bags			1
he said he was only about 10 feet away from the whale at the time of impact			2
within a few seconds the whale slid back into the water , but not before causing severe damage to the sailboat and leaving behind evidence that it had been injured in the encounter			0
' i saw a piece of rubbery type of material , ' he said			0
' it was skin from the whale			0
' but mr @entity11 had other things to worry about			1
@entity62 was gushing in through what he later discovered was a massive crack , the boat 's steering was damaged and any possible help was hours away			2
mr @entity11 said he was about 40 miles off the western coast of @entity4 , or about 400 miles southwest of @entity67			1
while the boat 's bilge pumps struggled to pump out the ocean water , he went to work trying to get the boat back on course			2
whale of a tale : @entity11 of @entity13 , 66 , was rescued on wednesday after his sailboat was hit by a whale rescuer : lieutenant @entity78 , of the @entity26 , ( pictured ) reassured @entity11 he would be rescued @entity11 activated an emergency beacon , which alerted the @entity26			1
with that information , officials at the command center were able to direct a merchant ship , which was about 60 miles away , to the sinking craft			0
mr @entity11 had a life raft on board and a larger inflatable boat , but neither was inflating sufficiently to be seaworthy			1
and the freighter redirected by the @entity26 , was still a few hours away			0
' i started making my peace with @entity92 , ' mr @entity11 said			1
' i thought i was going to die			0
' it 's when his spirits were lowest , when mr @entity11 first spotted the rescue ship off in the distance			2
' about that time i could see the freighter coming , ' he said			0
' i knew i was going to be ok			0
' stranded : @entity11 was sailing alone 40 miles west of @entity99 , @entity4 , when his boat was struck by a whale that sinking feeling : footage of @entity11 's yacht taken from the nose of a @entity107 plane collision : @entity11 's 50 - foot sailboat reflections ( pictured ) was struck by a whale the @entity26 also dispatched a @entity112 aircraft to help guide the rescue ship to the stricken boat			1
when the plane arrived and circled overhead , the air crew could see @entity11 bailing out water			2
when the ship arrived , crewmembers helped hoist him off his boat			0
@entity11 , who has spent most of his life on the sea , was unharmed during the ordeal			1
' this case is one of those success stories , ' coast guard petty officer 2nd class @entity124 said earlier this month , just after the rescue			0
' a man went out prepared , the worst happened to him and he was able to respond			0
' @entity11 spent six days on board the freighter as it steamed to @entity133			2
he arrived back in @entity13 friday , just two days before he and his wife , @entity134 , were to celebrate their 23rd anniversary .			1

@entity11 , 66 , from @entity13 , was on the last leg of a world trip and had been through pirate - *infested* waters without a hitch
