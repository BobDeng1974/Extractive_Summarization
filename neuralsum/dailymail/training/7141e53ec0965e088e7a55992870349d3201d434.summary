do n't expect @entity0 to turn into the green - eyed monster looking at colleague ’s rides any time soon – there is no need			1
lining up for the 35 - year - old @entity6 in the coming weeks should be his 2013 @entity8 winner @entity7 , @entity10 favourite @entity9 and recuperating 2013 @entity12 winner @entity11			1
@entity13 also has an enthusiastic eye on future talent			1
@entity0 wins the @entity16 with beat that @entity13 is looking ahead to racing up and coming horses including beat that and @entity20 that ’s why missing riding @entity26 , his @entity27 winner in march , on his return to action against @entity30 in saturday 's @entity31 at @entity32 and @entity33 , his @entity22 winner , in the @entity23 at @entity24 later this month , will not spark a hint of a tantrum			1
@entity13 said : ‘ i ca n’t say i am overly envious of anyone			1
i got a great ride from @entity39 last season			2
they are two horses you ’d like to ride but i hope to have two young horses to step up and snap at their heels in beat that and @entity20			1
‘ beat that was a frame of a horse last year and did well to win at @entity32 and @entity48			2
he should improve a lot physically			2
the hope is that he will be a @entity52 horse			0
more of that sets the standard but he should have a shout			0
’ @entity13 celebrates after winning the @entity57 at @entity58 with @entity33 the @entity60 jockey races to victory on @entity62 at the @entity27 at @entity63 @entity13 ’s aspirations for @entity66 , third in the @entity67 ’ @entity64 in march , will be tested when he carries top weight of 11st 12lb in tomorrow ’s @entity69			1
@entity13 said : ‘ even though he has top weight , his handicap mark is reasonable			1
he has pace but he does n’t lack physique – he is very strong			0
’ @entity13 rides @entity74 for his boss @entity75 in saturday afternoon ’s @entity76 , a race he won in 2002 on @entity79			1
@entity13 ( c ) leads eventual winner @entity81 to victory at the @entity83 ’ @entity64 the three - time @entity85 winner has not yet matched best hurdles form when chasing but @entity13 feels he knows the key			1
the rider said : ‘ the big thing is to get him into a rhythm jumping			0
if he does , he has a big chance			0
’ @entity13 ’s @entity93 got off to a good start on friday , easily landing the grade two @entity95 ’ @entity31 on @entity97 - trained 10 - 1 @entity81			2
the six - year - old , now the same odds to the @entity99 ’ @entity64 at the @entity100 in march , showed a classy turn of foot , hardly surprising given he won the 2011 @entity103 at @entity104 and his dam is 2000 @entity107 winner @entity106			0
@entity108 and @entity63 will not change the start time of the @entity76 , despite fears it could be disrupted by low sunlight			0
only 10 of the 16 obstacles were jumped in friday 's novices ’ chase won by @entity116 which started at 2.25pm			2
today ’s race is off at 2.30pm			0
spokesman @entity118 said the chance of a problem was ‘ low risk ’ but bha will hope to avoid an embarrassing hat - trick			0
two weeks ago the @entity123 at @entity124 was run over the wrong distance			0
last week ’s @entity126 at @entity127 was ‘ won ’ by ineligible entry @entity128 , subsequently disqualified .			0

@entity0 has no reason to envy any of his colleague 's rides
jockey has had major wins with @entity7 , @entity9 and @entity11
@entity13 missed out riding @entity26 and more of that again but has beat that and @entity20 lined up as future prospects
