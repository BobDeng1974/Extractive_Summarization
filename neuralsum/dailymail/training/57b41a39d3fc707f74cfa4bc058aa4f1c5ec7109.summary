lord @entity0 has accused the @entity1 of failing the public by dumbing down its programming and warned the corporation he may choose to make future programmes with rival broadcasters			1
the @entity8 peer , a fertility expert who presented the @entity11 - winning series @entity12 , accused the @entity1 of underrating the ability of the public to take an interest in hard - hitting scientific material			1
he told viewers of a @entity18 webchat that the corporation was hampering people 's ability to properly engage with issues like nuclear power and climate change by not giving them the facts			1
attack : lord @entity0 has accused the @entity1 of failing to educate the public on hard hitting scientific issues like climate change and nuclear power ' the public , first of all , are massively underrated			1
the public are perfectly capable of understanding really difficult issues , but if they are not given the tools for understanding it becomes a problem			2
' he said @entity1 managers had been reluctant to commission programmes he had suggested on climate change , presenting science he believed would change the ' emphasis ' of the debate on the issue			1
' they seem to think that they have to pursue viewing figures but actually if you get something that is interesting and well - made , people will watch it , ' he added			2
elsewhere in the interview , professor @entity0 accuses of the @entity1 of dumbing down the quality of its science broadcasting in order to attract more viewers			1
' one of the things that worries me is that very often now the @entity1 makes these programmes that they claim are inspiring about science but actually half the time the science that you watch or listen to is unintelligible , ' he said			1
@entity67 ’s nuclear expansion plans have been boosted after @entity69 engineering giant @entity68 signed a £ 700 million deal that will enable it to start building the next generation of power plants			0
the engineering giant is buying @entity74 - which has the rights to build reactors at @entity77 on @entity78 , @entity79 , and @entity80 in @entity81 - from its @entity84 owners @entity82 and @entity86 npower			0
in what it described as the start of a 100 - year commitment to the @entity67 , @entity68 confirmed that it intends to progress @entity74 ’s plans to build between two and three new nuclear plants at each site			0
' it 's not very well explained and i think that that 's rather shocking that our leading broadcaster has not really got that firmly under its belt			2
' it is not the first time that professor @entity0 has criticised the @entity1 for shying away from pursuing serious scientific programming			1
in 2008 he said then - director general @entity103 shows a lack of ' spine ' in his leadership , particularly over the resignation of @entity109 controller @entity108 over misleading footage of the @entity111			0
he added at the time that the corporation 's decision to shift towards entertainment and away from heavier subjects was ' a massive error of judgement ' that would come back to haunt it			2
and last year he told the @entity119 he was so fed up with ' the chaos and disorganisation ' at the broadcaster that he was considering quitting and pitching future programme ideas to a commercial channel			0
he spoke of his fury over the @entity1 's treatment of his series @entity127 , which focuses on a group of children born in 2000 and follows the influences that shape their personality as they grow up			1
according to professor @entity0 , producers were no longer filming — and at a crucial time when the children were reaching the brink of adolescence			0
‘ they have stopped filming the series , and by leaving it in the lurch as we reach the adolescent stage , it negates all we have done before , ’ the peer told @entity119 columnist @entity140 at the @entity141			0
‘ i have had talks with senior executive producers , but i ’ve got nowhere			0
‘ it is part of the @entity1 ’s remit to educate the public with programmes like this			2
it is n’t as if it is an expensive series , so any budgetary concerns seem like an excuse			0
and ok , it ’s not @entity161 , but it has very healthy audience figures for a programme of this kind			0

@entity1 are underrating the public 's ability to understand issues , he says
they are dumbing down science programming making it ' unintelligible ' , he adds
