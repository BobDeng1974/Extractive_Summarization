@entity0 has vowed to adopt a ‘ @entity2 ’s law ’ to allow the pardoning of tens of thousands of men convicted of gay sex when it was illegal			1
@entity2 , the @entity8 codebreaker , was convicted of homosexual activity in 1952 but given a posthumous royal pardon 15 months ago			1
since then his relatives have campaigned for the 49,000 men convicted under gross indecency laws to be similarly pardoned			1
mr @entity0 has said he will extend this to the families and friends of gay men who received convictions in their lifetime but died before they could apply to have the records changed			1
the @entity36 leader told @entity37 that , if elected prime minister in may , he would make the matter a priority			0
the campaign to parden gay men convicted of ' gross indecency ' has been backed by celebrities including @entity46 star @entity45 , who played mr @entity2 in the @entity48 - winning drama @entity47 he said : ‘ i think it ’s worth saying that we do want to extend the principles being applied to @entity2 and his family , to be able to say to others who were convicted of a criminal offence simply because of the person that they loved – whether they are alive or no longer alive – that we can get a pardon for them			1
‘ i think it ’s a stain on our society , frankly			0
i think it ’s right what ’s been done in relation to @entity2 and his family , but there are also other families that will have had relatives who were convicted , as i say , simply because of the person they love			1
' and i think it ’s time we acted for them , too			0
i think we owe it to the @entity74 ] community to make this move			0
’ @entity2 died after eating an apple laced with cyanide on 8 june 1954 , @entity2 's cleaner found him dead			1
a post-mortem examination established the cause of death was cyanide poisoning			0
an inquest determined that he had committed suicide , and he was cremated at @entity86 on 12 june			0
several scholars , and even his family , have suggested @entity2 's death was not suicide - and instead either an accident or linked to a conspiracy			1
when his body was discovered , an apple laid half - eaten next to his bed			0
it was never tested for cyanide but it is speculated it was the source of the fatal does			0
some more peculiar theories suggest @entity2 was ' obsessed ' with fairytale @entity98 and his death was inspired by the poison apple in the story			1
the theory was supported in an article in @entity105 written by @entity2 's friend , the author @entity107 , in 2011			2
however , later evidence suggested that @entity2 habitually ate an apple before bed , and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half - eaten			2
his mother is said to have thought the ingestion was accidental , cause by her son 's storage of chemicals in his home			0
speaking on the 100th anniversary of @entity2 's birth on 23rd june 2012 , professor of philosophy @entity118 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , questioned the evidence given to the inquiry in 1954			2
he said there was no evidence of premeditation - there was no suicide note and he seemed to be in a cheerful mood in the days leading up to his death			0
he added that @entity2 's career was at an all time high and that he would not want to intentionally kill himself			2
he pointer out that his friend @entity136 stayed with @entity2 a week before his death and he remarked how happy @entity2 seemed finally , the academic remarked that the inquest was so bad that @entity2 could even have been murdered			2
although it is is unclear who would have wanted to murder him mr @entity118 said his work at @entity142 was under strict secrecy until well after his death			0
last week relatives of the mathematician and codebreaker delivered a petition to @entity148 calling for all those convicted under anti-gay laws to be pardoned			1
celebrities including @entity45 , who played @entity2 in the @entity48 - winning film @entity47 , have also backed the campaign			1
during the @entity8 , @entity2 was pivotal in cracking the @entity156 @entity155 codes , which gave vital information about @entity159 ’s forces			1
historians credit the work of @entity2 and his fellow codebreakers at @entity142 in @entity163 with shortening the war by up to two years , saving countless lives			2
@entity2 is also widely seen as the father of computer science and artificial intelligence			2
but in 1952 he was convicted for homosexual activity , which was illegal at the time , after having an affair with a 19 - year - old man in @entity172			0
@entity2 underwent ‘ chemical castration ’ as part of his sentence and his conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and meant he was no longer able to work for @entity178			0
he died two years later , aged 41 , having apparently committed suicide by eating an apple laced with cyanide			0
in 2013 @entity2 was granted a royal pardon after a request from justice secretary @entity185			1
@entity45 said : ‘ @entity2 was not only prosecuted , but quite arguably persuaded to end his own life early , by a society who called him a criminal for simply seeking out the love he deserved , as all human beings do			1
