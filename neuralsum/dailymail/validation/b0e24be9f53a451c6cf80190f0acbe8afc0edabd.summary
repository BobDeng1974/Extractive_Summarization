in a combined xv from these three sides , @entity0 would be the first name on my team sheet and he ’d be my captain			1
@entity7 ’s kicking gets him in at full - back ahead of @entity9 and @entity10			1
i ’ve chosen @entity12 wings because @entity13 is still coming back to form as is @entity15			0
that ’s a big statement but it shows just how highly i regard @entity18 and @entity19			2
alongside @entity20 at centre , i ’m picking @entity22			1
in a combined xv from these three sides , @entity0 ( centre ) would be the first name on my team sheet @entity7 's goal - kicking sees him get the nod over @entity9 and @entity10 at full - back @entity29 centre @entity22 ( right ) would partner @entity20 in midfield @entity32 v @entity31 highlights i ’m a massive fan of @entity33 but he ’s not quite at his best at the moment			1
@entity35 and @entity36 combine so well and @entity35 is the no 1 fly - half in world rugby , so they pick themselves			2
in the forwards , i ’ve put a fit @entity42 in ahead of @entity43			0
and @entity44 gets the nod ahead of @entity46 at @entity47 because he was superb against @entity48			0
@entity31 tighthead @entity44 was superb against @entity48 and gets the nod over @entity46			0

@entity0 would be the first name on my team sheet
@entity7 ’s kicking gets him in at full - back ahead of @entity9 and @entity10
@entity19 and @entity18 would be my wingers
alongside @entity20 at centre , i ’m picking @entity22
@entity35 and @entity36 would be my starting half backs
@entity44 would start at tighthead ahead of @entity46
@entity65 and @entity66 would start together at lock
