if that was n’t shocking enough , many in the sizeable crowd that gathered around applauded as the father lashed him with a stick			0
the boy from @entity18 in @entity20 province , south - west @entity21 , skipped classes after receiving the equivalent of £ 10 from his father			1

a crowd gathers at the scene where a father has stripped his nine - year - old son and tied him to a tree before viciously beating him			0
the man said his son was being punished for skipping school and failing to return home the picture taker , @entity40 , said that the temperature was only 5c when the all but naked child was tied to the tree and beaten			0
corporal punishment of the kind meted out to the @entity18 boy is lawful in @entity21 , although there are legal provisions to prevent excessive child abuse			1
the law even goes to far as to allow authorities to order parents to subject their children to ' strict discipline ' if they are guilty of serious misbehaviour			2
traditionally , corporal punishment is common among @entity21 families , although attitudes are beginning to change in the country			1
in a letter to the @entity64 , @entity61 , a pupil at @entity62 , wrote : ' many traditional @entity21 families use corporal punishment to teach their children			1
' they believe that once the pain is over , the lesson will be engraved on the child 's mind and the mistake will not be repeated			0
it 's an easy way of " teaching " children right from wrong			2
' according to a 2010 study cited by the @entity76 to end corporal punishment , around half of of girls and three in five boys in @entity21 had experienced ' mild ' corporal punishment in the past month			1
that included spanking hitting , or slapping with a bare hand ; hitting or slapping on the hand , arm , or leg ; shaking ; or hitting with an object , according to the study published in the @entity91			0
a further 10 per cent of girls and 15 per cent of boys reported experiencing severe corporal punishment , which included hitting or slapping on the face , head , or ears or repeated beating with an implement			1
corporal punishment is common among traditional @entity21 families , and lawful in the country			1
a recent study found half of girls and three fifths of boys had been subjected to mild corporal punishment at home this case from @entity18 undoubtedly falls into that latter category			1
according to the father , his son had been absent from school for several days without his knowledge , and the boy did n't even come back home the previous evening			0
in the morning , the father saw his son wandering the street			0
the boy tried to run , but his father caught him and beat him			2
with onlookers ' interference and persuasion , the father soon untied his son and took him away .			0

it is legal and common practice for parents to beat their children in @entity21
nearly half of girls and three fifths of boys report mild corporal punishment
fewer , but still *significant* numbers , report *suffering* severe beatings
