by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 11:46 est , 29 october 2012 updated : 05:06 est , 30 october 2012 @entity2 proposed an elected president for @entity4 yesterday			1
the former prime minister , who would be a leading candidate for such a post , said a president was needed as part of a ‘ grand bargain ’ to save the eurozone from its debt nightmare			1
his intervention came as @entity13 , head of the @entity14 , insisted @entity15 must have a direct say in national budgets			1
job application : @entity2 said a directly - elected president of @entity4 would help prevent the break - up of the @entity21 ‘ in order to restore confidence in the euro area , countries need to transfer part of their sovereignty to the @entity4 level , ’ mr @entity13 told the @entity23 magazine @entity22			1
‘ a lot of governments have yet to realise that they lost their national sovereignty a long time ago			2
because , in the past , they have allowed their debt to pile up , they now need the goodwill of the financial markets			0
that sounds like a paradox , but it is nonetheless true			0
‘ only when the euro area countries are willing to share sovereignty at the @entity4 level will they gain sovereignty			0
’ mr @entity2 , who has made clear his desire for another major job in politics , said in a major speech at the @entity51 in @entity52 that voters across the continent should elect ‘ a big post held by one person ’ to reinvigorate enthusiasm for the @entity4 project			1
he said : ‘ if eurozone structures end up with a @entity4 that is fundamentally divided politically as well as economically ; rather than a @entity4 with one political settlement that accommodates different levels of integration within it , the @entity21 as we know it will be on a path to break up			0
’ but he added : ‘ out of this @entity4 crisis can come the opportunity finally to achieve a model of @entity4 integration that is sustainable			0
a @entity4 - wide election for the presidency ... is the most direct way to involve the public			2
‘ an election for a big post held by one person – this people can understand			1
the problem with the @entity80 is that though clearly democratically elected , my experience is people do n’t feel close to their meps			2
’ he claimed too few people knew who their meps are , and a powerful figurehead straddling the continent would stop people feeling ‘ alienated ’ from @entity15			2
@entity90 leader @entity89 said mr @entity2 is a ' man who would sell his country for the bauble of @entity21 office ' critics said the comments , in a speech in @entity52 , were a blatant pitch for the job but hoped his ambitions would be thwarted			1
mr @entity2 warned that the @entity21 would break - up if it was unable to resolve the crisis over the eurozone			1
but if greater integration in the single currency bloc created a two or three - speed @entity4 , it could spell the end of the @entity21 as it currently stands			0
in his address to the @entity107 , he said a directly - elected @entity21 president could bridge the growing ‘ democratic deficit ’ between the people of @entity4 and politicians in @entity15			2
designing a new union will be ‘ very difficult ’ , he said			0
‘ the danger is that the more we talk of “ bringing @entity4 closer to the people ” , the more “ the people ” feel alienated from it			2
‘ a @entity4 wide election for the @entity119 or @entity51 is the most direct way to involve the public			2
‘ an election for a big post held by one person – this people can understand			1
‘ the problem with the @entity80 is that though clearly democratically elected , my experience is people do n’t feel close to their mep ’s			0
‘ this could change but only if the @entity80 and national parliaments interact far more closely			0
’ he also issued a ‘ stark warning ’ that if eurozone structures ‘ end up with a @entity4 that is fundamentally divided politically as well as economically ; rather than a @entity4 with one political settlement that accommodates different levels of integration within it , the @entity21 as we know it will be on a path to break up ’			0
but opponents of mr @entity2 were scathing about his hopes of leading a federal @entity4			1
@entity89 , leader of the @entity144 @entity90 , said : ‘ this is the man who would sell his country for the bauble of @entity21 office			1
this a man who can not be trusted with our or any other country 's future			0
‘ he hopes that the @entity21 can in some way have one speed while travelling at two			0
it just is n't possible			0
his hopes will be dashed , as i hope will his ambitions			1

former prime minister claims a ' big post held by one person ' would make voters feel closer to @entity15
@entity163 insisted @entity15 must have direct say in national budgets
@entity90 leader @entity89 hopes mr @entity2 's ' ambitions will be dashed '
