ten thousand tenants have purchased their properties since last year , the highest level since before the recession , after the government increased the discounts available prime minister @entity28 ( left ) with first time buyers @entity30 ( right ) and her partner @entity31 this week @entity28 praised the opening up of home ownership to those previously locked out of the property market , and said the money raised would be ploughed into building more affordable homes			1
new proposals expected to be made law by next year would further relax the rules , allowing tenants to buy their homes after living in them for just three years , rather than the current five			2
@entity44 , the new housing minister , said : ' for years the right to buy was allowed to wither on the vine , with ever - decreasing discounts leaving the prospect of home ownership out of reach for far too many social tenants			0
' but our reinvigorated scheme has changed that , with increased discounts helping more than 10,000 new homeowners on to the property ladder			0
' and because we 've committed to using the additional money raised towards funding new affordable homes for rent , we 're also getting @entity60 building and will soon have the fastest rate of affordable house - building for two decades			2
' since the discounts were increased in april last year 8,398 people took up the offer in the following 12 months			2
another 2,149 did so in april to june this year			0
the sales will generate £ 173million for local councils to use to build new houses			0

in @entity23 , where house prices rose most dramatically in the years before the economic crash , average discount fell from 53 per cent to just 10 per cent over the same decade			1
@entity28 said : ' the success of right - to - buy shows how the new reinvigorated scheme is opening up the prospect of home ownership to even more people across the country			1
' with over 10,000 people taking up the opportunity to buy their council home this year , the demand to make that step on to the housing ladder is clear			1
' what is more , we 're ploughing the additional money from right - to - buy sales straight back into building more affordable homes			2
' this week saw the launch of help to buy - in which working people who can afford mortgage payments but do not have a large deposit can put down just 5 per cent of its value , and have another 15 per cent guaranteed by the government			0
