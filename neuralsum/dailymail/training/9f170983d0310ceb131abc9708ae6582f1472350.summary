by @entity0 published : 05:10 est , 1 february 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 1 february 2013 doctors encourage us to get our five fruit and veg a day - but one mother has to be incredibly careful which ones she eats ... because the wrong choice could kill her			1
@entity6 , 25 , has a rare condition called salicylate sensitivity , which means she suffers itching , delirium and even coughs up blood if she eats certain foods			1
salicylates are chemicals that occur naturally in many plants , including many fruits and vegetables			1
in high enough doses they are harmful to anyone , however most people can handle a certain amounts of salicylate in food			1
the mother - of - one has been hospitalised on several occasions after eating food such as tomatoes and pears			1
when she ate a pear , she was rushed to hospital itching and coughing up blood			1
after she ate some spices , her throat swelled up so much she could not breathe			1
salicylates are chemicals found naturally in plants and in many pain relief medication such as aspirin			1
sensitivity is rare and the severity of symptoms varies from person to person			1
these include headaches , an itchy skin rash , stomach pain , wheezing and trouble breathing			2
in severe cases it can lead to anaphylaxis , a life - threatening reaction than can cause loss of consciousness and organ failure			2
there is no cure and prevention is the best form of treatment by avoiding certain foods			2
fruit with high levels of salicylates include apricots , avocados , blackberries , oranges , pineapples , plums , raisins and strawberries			1
pears contain moderate levels if unpeeled and low levels if peeled			2
vegetables with high levels include chillis , courgettes , gherkins , radishes and tomatoes			2
spices to avoid include cayenne , curry powder and dill			2
once after eating a tomato , @entity25 suffered from a severe headache , brought up blood and became delirious and disorientated			1
the 25 - year - old said : ' i 've been hospitalised so many times because of my condition			1
i 'm worried if i had a pear or spice again , it could kill me			2
' @entity25 , who is mother to three - year - old @entity111 , was finally diagnosed with salicylate intolerance a few months ago			1
she must now avoid a long list of foods to avoid includes shellfish , canned and smoked meats , all fruits except bananas , broccoli , cucumber , pie fillings , vegetable oil , yoghurt , jam , fruit drinks , fizzy drinks , table sauces such as ketchup , most herbs and spices , biscuits , sweets and custard			1
she carries an @entity135 - a device containing a shot of adrenaline for emergency treatment			2
before her diagnosis , @entity25 often ate foods she was intolerant to and had to phone for an ambulance to rush her to hospital			0
she now struggles to make meals for herself , knowing that many ingredients could be life - threatening			0
@entity25 , from @entity147 , said : ' it started when i was younger and my mum says as a baby i would projectile vomit			0
' she had to keep changing my milk to find something i could have			0
then as a child , i seemed to be okay , until i was about 15			0
' i started getting really bad headaches and being sick			0
when i had cola it would bubble back up into my mouth , like when you shake up a can			0
@entity25 , 25 , has had problems with food since she was a baby , but was only diagnosed a few months ago ' if i go out with my friends , i have to phone the restaurant in advance and ask lots of questions about what they cook things in and how food is prepared			1
' so many things are bad for me			0
often i 'll just have a bowl of porridge because it is the easiest thing to make			0
i 'll sit having tea with @entity111 and he will say ' @entity177 , why are you having breakfast ? ' @entity25 reacts differently to different foods - anything from a bad itch and headache to coughing up blood and suffering a swollen throat			1
she has thoroughly researched the condition on the internet , but the only place she can find currently investigating the disorder is a clinic in @entity191			1
she said : ' i 've been told i can be referred to a dietician , but different people suffer from intolerance to different foods			0
' i was told i could eat pears - but one pear almost killed me			0
i 'm suffering from depression because i can not lead a normal life			0
' @entity25 's mother @entity200 , 47 , said she knew something was wrong when her daughter was a baby			0
she said : ' she used to projectile vomit all the time			0
she was my first child , so i did n't know if it was normal or not or what to do			0
' i told the midwife and she said to keep trying her on different milks			0
eventually we found one that was okay			0
' it was very worrying though - she was dehydrated from all the vomiting			0
