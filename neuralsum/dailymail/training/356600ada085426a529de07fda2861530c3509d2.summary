transport spokesman @entity14 said ministers were also looking at forcing young drivers to display ‘ probationary plates ’ showing they had recently passed their test			1
his comments over what has been dubbed a ‘ graduated driving licence ’ firm up ideas floated in november by transport secretary @entity23 and have the support of the insurance industry			1
they came at question time in the @entity28 after @entity30 baroness @entity29 raised the case of @entity2 footballer @entity1 , who was jailed for 16 months after killing two adults and injuring two teenagers in central @entity34			1
the 18 - year - old had been travelling at up to twice the 30mph speed limit in his @entity6 and admitted causing death by dangerous driving			1
@entity39 said : ‘ he had been noted as playing games with a @entity41 before the accident occurred			0
he is disqualified now for three years			0
’ she said changes to improve the safety of newly - qualified drivers had been ‘ resisted by too many governments ’ and it was ‘ time something was done ’			1
lord @entity14 said it was an ‘ extreme case but sadly it was not unique ’			2
he said young drivers were prone to ' immaturity and reckless driving '			1
‘ they can also be easily distracted particularly when driving carrying others , ' he said			2
‘ we are seeking to improve the risk of these very sad accidents and we will continue on the work of the previous government in doing so			0
’ victims : the @entity59 driver , @entity60 , 32 , left , and his sister , front - seat passenger @entity62 , 37 , right , were both killed in the crash independent crossbench peer @entity65 of @entity67 said the government should consider ‘ probationary plates on young drivers until they are about 21 ’			1
lord @entity14 said : ‘ probationary plates are one of the things we are considering , possibly linked with other measures such as not allowing young and new drivers to carry young passengers in order to deal with that sort of problem			1
’ career ruined : @entity78 can be seen here playing for the @entity2 youth team independent crossbencher the @entity80 questioned how it was possible to legislate for the ‘ exuberance of youth ’			1
‘ even if they have a green plate on the back of their car they are going to test the boundaries of law as hard as they can , ’ she said			0
‘ i 'm not advocating that they should break the law but we must face facts			0
we have all been young once and done foolish things			2
’ but lord @entity14 told her : ‘ experience in @entity102 shows that a longer driving supervision can reduce the risk of accidents later on and that is one of the things we are looking at			2
’ the announcement comes after transport secretary @entity23 raised the prospect in november of banning young drivers in @entity110 and @entity111 from carrying anyone except family members as passengers			1
it was one of a range of ideas he was looking at to road deaths involving newly - qualified motorists			2
the @entity121 said the introduction of p - plates ’ for probationers was one of the options they were looking at			2
convicted : this image was taken after @entity128 had passed his driving test roads minister @entity131 said : ‘ we want to improve the safety of young drivers - that is why we have made the driving test more realistic by introducing an independent driving element and have stopped publishing test routes to stop candidates learning them by rote			1
‘ as part of the ongoing work to reduce the risks of accidents involving young drivers , we are considering several options to ensure that newly qualified drivers are properly prepared and drive safely			1
motorists caught driving while using their mobile phones have blamed ' ranting ' ex-wives , over-zealous bosses and even childbirth for their offending behaviour , according to police			2
one driver also admitted failing to see a red light because he was on the phone and another denied making a call saying he was only using the internet			0
@entity158 and @entity159 have released details of the excuses given by drivers as part of a campaign targeting the use of mobile phones while behind the wheel			2
in one case , the driver stopped by police pleaded for help from the officer and said : ' it was my ex-wife harassing me , can you speak to her ? ' another motorist blamed work pressures when he said : ' my boss called to see where i was			2
' a father - to - be explained : ' i answered the phone because my wife is having a baby and i thought she may have gone into labour			0
' the lure of a smart phone proved too tempting for one motorist , who said : ' i 'm not on the phone , i am looking something up on the internet '			0
while another pleaded : ' i was n't calling anyone , i was replying to an email			0
' another driver admitted : ' i am always using it			0
it 's about time i got caught			0
' @entity198 , @entity159 's cabinet member for community safety , said : ' it may be tempting to answer a call or check your @entity201 while driving , but it is a huge distraction and the consequences can be devastating			2
' you are four times more likely to crash if you use a mobile phone while driving			0
' your reaction times are 50 % slower and you are more likely to drift across lanes			0
' ‘ we will continue to work with young people , the insurance industry , and other key partners in considering any changes affecting learner drivers and those who have just passed their test			1
’ insurers also back such measures believing peer pressure on young drivers can lead them to take risks			1
the @entity222 says drivers aged 17 - 24 are responsible for a disproportionately high number of crashes , deaths and claims and that an 18 - year - old is more than three times as likely as a 48 - year - old to be involved in a crash			1
a third of drivers killed in car accidents are under 25 , despite under 25s forming only one in eight of all car drivers			1
mr @entity238 said at the time : ‘ when i talk to young people who have recently passed their test , what they say sometimes is that peer pressure is put on them to go fast , to show off			1
‘ there is a suggestion as to whether you should look at a restriction whether anyone could carry passengers for six or nine months when they have first passed their test			0
‘ there are suggestions about them only perhaps being allowed to take a family member to drive a car when you are learning , you have to have a qualified driver in the car			0
so these are all sorts of areas that i think we can look at			0
’ the @entity222 has called for an overhaul in the system - suggesting people should spend a year learning to drive and urging the introduction of a graduated licence for the first six months after passing a test			0
@entity222 spokesman @entity265 said : ‘ other countries have adopted these measures and their experience has shown that they 're largely self - policing			0
‘ of course there will always be people who will look to avoid the law , but the reality is if you impose something like this , and encourage people to follow it , international experience has shown that that is exactly what people do			0
