by @entity0 for @entity6 , 36 , from the tiny village of @entity8 in southern @entity9 , life for him , his wife @entity1 and their three children has n't always been easy			1
but the family 's life has taken a turn for the better after mr @entity6 moved to @entity13 - allowing him to put a grand plan to rake in £ 40,000 in @entity16 benefits into action			1
six months after arriving in the capital , mr @entity6 is sending home £ 800 each week - and says ' @entity20 ' has ' given me everything '			1
' she 's give me home free			0
she 's give me money free			0
she 's give me everything			0
' the @entity16 has become an increasingly popular destination for @entity41 @entity40 gypsies , with a staggering 200,000 arriving in the last decade alone			1
reasons for the influx include ostracism at home and a lack of job opportunities , as well as the ease with which migrants can access benefits in the @entity16			1
the latter is something mr @entity6 knows all too well			1
' @entity20 is one country with much money , ' he says			0
' i need maybe £ 40,000 for my family and i think this money i can make in one year , maybe two			1
' i want to make one good house with three rooms , one bathroom , a fridge , plasma tv ... my family is very important and i love my family			2
for them , i do everything			0
' poverty : mr @entity6 in his home village of @entity8 in @entity9 prior to his departure for @entity13 six months ago not happy : mr @entity6 says he needs to make money for the sake of his wife @entity1 and their three young children if he does n't manage to rake in enough cash , his plans will take a criminal turn			1
' if i do n't have food , i 'll go and steal , ' he admits			2
' the pocket , the paper and sometimes in the house if there is nobody , take , yeah			0
' although his wife @entity1 has remained in @entity8 with the couple 's three children , joining mr @entity6 in @entity13 is his sister , her husband and their neighbours @entity90 and @entity91			1
also in @entity13 is mr @entity6 's 15 - year - old daughter @entity92 , recently married and pregnant with her first child			1
' my daughter is coming here together with her husband and she 's going to stay here because is good country , ' says mr @entity6 happily			2
' we gon na make some money quick and she 's going to be everything ok			2
i am very happy for this			0
' like most @entity40 travelling to the @entity16 , mr @entity6 's transport and accommodation were paid for by his clan leader , who takes a cut from any money he makes and any benefits he claims			1
along with claiming as much as possible , including tax credits for his children in @entity9 , mr @entity6 has also been working for his clan boss as a scrap metal collector			1
tough times : mr @entity6 ( centre ) , his wife @entity1 ( left ) and his brother - in - law who has also travelled to the @entity16 squalid : the grim conditions in which mr @entity6 's family live in their home village of @entity8 in @entity9 ' i 'm going to take any metal from the street because i need money , ' says mr @entity6			1
' and if i see something , i 'm going to the home			0
i knock on the door and i 'm ask if there is any metal			0
if it 's outside , from garden i take , no i do n't ask , because it 's outside			0
' @entity134 , also living in the @entity16 , takes a similar approach to scrap metal collecting			1
' bicycles are the easiest thing to take and the money from this is quite good , ' he explains			0
' i take 10 to15 bikes , we sell them and make money			2
' lucrative though the scrap metal trade can be , the real money spinner is benefits and mr @entity6 says he is sending up to £ 800 a week home to his family			1
' i think it 's good money for me now , for the moment , ' he says cheerfully			0
' i have children benefit , i have tax working credit and i have child tax credit			1
£ 820 so it 's good money for me			2
new job : mr @entity6 is topping up his benefits by collecting scrap metal - of both the legal and illegal varieties ' this week , monday , i sent £ 500 and today , i 'm going to send more £ 300			1
it 's £ 800 just this week			0
it 's good money because i need for my family this money because i know in @entity9 , life is heavy			2
if i do n't have money , do n't have nothing			0
' is he at all embarrassed about the amount he 's being handed ? the answer is no. ' some people think it 's bad if you have benefit or something but i think it 's not , ' he says			0
' i think it 's very good			0
it 's good for me and my family			0
i do n't have any interest in what they think , other people			0
it 's my life , my family and i think i am lucky , yeah ! ' @entity6 appears on @entity182 : life on the @entity184 , tonight at 9pm on @entity185			2
