@entity0 finally broke his @entity2 duck , as his two goals put the @entity4 into the semi-finals of the competition			1
before sunday night , @entity0 had not scored since becoming @entity8 's most expensive footballer last month , and the @entity10 man struggled for form so far at this tournament , finding chances hard to come by , and even harder to take			0
but against the tournament favourites he twice headed his country in front , the second coming from a cross by his new team - mate @entity18			2
@entity0 ( right ) celebrates his first goal with team - mates including @entity21 ( left ) in @entity22 @entity4 's substitutes go wild after @entity0 's opening goal of the quarter - final clash @entity0 ( out of shot ) heads home a @entity18 free - kick to give @entity4 a 2 - 1 lead in the second half bony wheels away to celebrate his second goal of the night , which turned out to be the winner @entity4 : @entity34 , @entity21 , @entity35 , @entity18 , @entity36 , @entity37 ( @entity38 67 ) , @entity39 , @entity18 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity0 ( @entity42 90 ) goals : @entity0 ( 2 ) , @entity41 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 @entity53 : @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 ( @entity64 72 mins ) , @entity65 ( @entity66 72 ) subs not used : @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 goals : @entity65 booked : @entity60 , @entity79 in between @entity65 had levelled things up , keeping his calm to finish from close range after @entity63 had taken advantage of some dreadful defending			1
but the @entity84 withstood heavy pressure from the tournament favourites , before a last - minute @entity41 strike sealed their passage to a last - four clash with @entity90			2
after a slow start , when the first opportunity fell @entity0 ’s way in the 26th minute , he could scarcely have asked for a simpler task			2
@entity39 , the @entity84 ’ player of the tournament so far , put a cross into the box for @entity0 to attack , and the @entity99 defence simply stood and watched as the @entity10 striker met it			0
@entity102 in goal , rather like his team - mates , put more effort into appealing for offside than stopping @entity0 from scoring , so by the time the big forward headed the ball he was six yards out , unmarked , and with a keeper standing still with his hands in the air			1
for the @entity115 ’s top goalscorer in 2014 , it was unmissable			0
@entity53 hit back through @entity65 , but @entity0 rose brilliantly at the near post to head @entity18 ’s free kick home and keep his side on course for their first @entity2 title since 1992			1
following both goals @entity123 ’s side sat deep and invited the @entity53 onto them , playing an organised game and using their pace on the break			0
ex-arsenal man @entity41 slots the ball into the bottom corner to give @entity4 a two - goal advantage @entity132 forward @entity41 celebrates after finishing off a counter attack in stoppage time to make it 3 - 1 @entity53 forward @entity136 ( centre ) celebrates with his team - mates after finding the back of the net @entity4 's @entity35 ( left ) wins a header under pressure from @entity53 's @entity63 @entity53 have struggled to break down organised defences all tournament , and the @entity84 proved an obstinate nut to crack			1
@entity62 sweezed between defenders on the left hand side early on to cause slight panic in the box , but when @entity34 flapped at the ball it would n’t fall kindly for @entity65			0
it was actually the elephants who looked more likely to score when they got on the break , both @entity41 and @entity39 causing @entity58 problems down the right wing			2
neither winger could find much end product , but while their defence kept the @entity99 at arm ’s length , it looked like being enough			0
however the north africans came out strongly at the start of the second half , and a long ball over the @entity4 defence saw @entity34 inexplicably charge out of his goal			2
@entity0 ( right ) and his team - mates celebrate with the @entity4 fans after the final whistle @entity40 of the @entity4 ( right ) drives forward as @entity174 's @entity60 attempts to tackle him @entity10 new boy @entity0 tussles for the ball with @entity53 's @entity60 during the first half the ball broke to @entity63 who found @entity65 in the six - yard - box			1
the striker – the only man in the @entity99 starting line - up born in the country , with the rest @entity182 - @entity99 – kept his cool to smash it home			0
buoyed by their goal the @entity99 pushed on , and @entity65 should have had a second , but his shot from point blank range was brilliantly saved following @entity61 ’s scuffed shot across the face of goal			0
@entity0 ’s goal brought an even more concerted effort from the @entity53 , but they rarely looked like scoring			1
@entity58 came the closest to forcing the game to extra time with a freekick that forced @entity34 into a fine save , while @entity199 ’s @entity198 produced an excellent block late on			0
but the @entity84 held on , with @entity41 calmly converting a counter-attack deep into stoppage time , and they must surely now be the favourites for a major title that has thus far eluded the ‘ golden generation ’ .			1

@entity0 opened the scoring with a header in the 24th minute
@entity53 levelled through @entity136 early in the second half
but @entity0 converted a @entity18 free - kick to seal *victory* for @entity4
former @entity214 forward @entity41 added a third goal in stoppage time
the elephants have reached the last four of the @entity2
