a test that could diagnose diabetes years earlier than the current method is being developed by scientists			1
the early warning could help prevent debilitating and deadly complications , such as strokes and heart attacks , blindness , kidney disease and nerve and circulatory damage			0
the blood test detects type 2 diabetes , the most common form of the disease , which accounts for 90 per cent of the more than three million @entity16 with diabetes			1
a new test is being developed by scientists which could diagnose common type 2 diabetes ' years earlier ' at the moment , the illness is diagnosed by testing for high sugar levels in the blood			1
but researchers from the @entity26 and @entity27 say that by the time blood sugar is raised , some of the damage caused by the disease in its early stages has already been done			2
to find out whether testing for other compounds such as fatty molecules would give an earlier result , they studied almost 100 women who had been classed at high , medium or low risk of diabetes two years earlier			0
although their blood sugar levels were normal , there were differences in other compounds in the blood , including some found in fat , as well as vitamin d and some proteins			2
differences were also found in their blood vessels , with those at high risk of developing diabetes having the least healthy arteries and veins			0
all complications associated with diabetes – from blindness to heart attacks and strokes – are thought to stem from blood vessel damage			2
scientists predict new test could be used widely within the next five years and may lead to a change in the definition of type 2 diabetes the researchers are refining the test and say it could be used widely in five years to warn of type 2 diabetes months or even years early			1
researcher @entity69 , of @entity27 , said : ‘ the current method of categorising type 2 diabetes solely by a patient ’s glucose levels means that many will already have suffered blood vessel damage and so will experience poorer outcomes			1
’ the new test may lead to a change in the definition of type 2 diabetes so that those who test positive are said to have it , rather than merely be at risk of it , he added			1
the findings , published in the journal @entity85 , could also lead to new drugs for diabetes			0
professor @entity69 said that existing treatments that focus on lowering blood sugar levels help in the short term , and patients should still take them			2
the news came as scientists claimed yesterday to have discovered how to ‘ switch off ’ autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and type 1 diabetes			0
autoimmune diseases are caused when the body ’s immune system overreacts , attacking its own tissue as it tries to fight disease			0
in research , published today in @entity103 , a team at the @entity105 discovered how to convert cells from being overly aggressive to acting normally and protecting against disease .			0

blood test is being developed by scientists to detect most common form
type 2 diabetes accounts for 90 per cent of 3 million @entity16 with illness
researchers say raising blood sugar levels for current test causes damage
scientists predict new test could be used widely within the next five years
