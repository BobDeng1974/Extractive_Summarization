@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , saw her weight rocket following her wedding to husband @entity12 22 years ago			1
the 39 - year - old ballooned to a size 32 in clothes as she and her husband and daughter lived on a diet of pie and mash , takeaways and other unhealthy food , and rarely ate fresh fruit and vegetables			1
but , when her daughter @entity26 , 12 , began to be picked on at school about her mother 's weight , @entity25 decided to take action and has got down to a svelte size 12			1
@entity7 's doctor offered her two months free at her local @entity34 club to help her shift the pounds @entity7 ' had always been big ' , as she was ' brought up on proper meals , and had a weakness for biscuits ' with sky - high blood pressure , @entity7 's doctor offered her two months free at her local @entity34 club to help her shift the pounds and reduce the risk of further health problems			1
@entity7 said : ' i have always been big , i was brought up on proper meals , and i 've got a weakness for biscuits ! ' i slimmed down when i got married , which i found easy , i think because i had a serious goal to work for			2
' but when i tried to lose weight after that , it never worked			0
i tried loads of fad diets but i do n't think i was motivated enough to lose significant amounts			0
@entity7 , pictured with daughter @entity26 , did n't want her being picked on ' i did n't want @entity26 being picked on either			1
she had never been fat , but children can be cruel and she was getting to the age where girls in particular were very conscious about their weight			0
' @entity7 swapped stodgy meals and packets of biscuits for healthy salads and carrot sticks and saw eight pounds drop off her in the first week on the diet			1
breakfast : @entity63 mid-morning snack : shortbread biscuits lunch : fish and chips dinner : @entity70 supper : @entity72 and biscuits snacks : crisps breakfast : magic porridge - oats & yoghurt mid-morning snack : chopped fruit and veg lunch : chicken salad dinner : chicken curry with rice but the housewife , whose husband @entity12 works as a train driver , admits that it was n't easy to begin with			0
she said : ' going through the doors to @entity34 was terrifying			2
i felt like everyone was looking at me			0
' but everyone was so welcoming			0
at the end of the day we were all there for the same reason and it was good to have people around me spurring me on			0
' the @entity34 diet plan involves food optimising , allowing slimmers to eat what they want but in moderation , to try and avoid binging due to cravings			1
@entity7 said : ' we are allowed to have 15 ' sins ' a day which works out at 105 a week			1
a cream cake for example is 40 sins , so it made you think about how many you would have left that week and whether it was really worth it			1
' if i was going out for a big meal , i would tend to use all my sins on one night , knowing then that i 'd had my treat for the week and had to be good until the following week			0
' @entity7 quickly left behind baggy tops and elasticated waistlines as she regained a figure and was able to shop on the high street for more fitted outfits			2
and last week , she proudly pulled on a pair of jeans ten sizes smaller than her old jogging bottoms			0
@entity7 thinks her choosing to lose weight brought her and daughter @entity26 ' closer than we ever had been before ' - and she quickly wanted to swap snacking on chocolate for carrot sticks as @entity7 has become healthier and gained bags of energy , her daughter @entity26 began to take an interest in leading a better lifestyle			1
' it was amazing how @entity26 's outlook on food changed , ' said @entity7			1
' i never forced her to eat differently , she was just interested in what i was having and began to prefer my meals			0
' the mother and daughter started cooking healthy and nutritious dinners together , as well as going to swimming together , or playing on @entity26 's @entity146			1
@entity7 said : ' i think me choosing to lose weight brought us closer than we ever had been before			2
' we did so many activities together , and the best part was , we enjoyed them			0
' when @entity12 is away , @entity26 and i snuggle up together in bed and watch a dvd			2
' but she quickly wanted to swap snacking on chocolate for carrot sticks			1
' while @entity7 has now reached her target weight , she is planning on continuing with the @entity34 classes to keep up her motivation to stay slim			1
@entity7 said : ' i think you need the fear factor when losing weight			2
without having to go and stand on those scales every week , i think it would be very easy to put the weight back on			0
' also i would miss going to the sessions			0
i have become close with a lot of the other members and with the group leader			0
i think i would miss it if i left			0
