by @entity0 last updated at 1:30 pm on 31st october 2011 @entity1 and @entity2 are nowhere in sight			1
and new creatures too , like @entity7 , a kindly donkey who loves to sing , and @entity10 , a vain crocodile who lives at the bottom of a well			1
@entity14 is coming to @entity15 but not as generations of @entity17 know it			1
the tv show has a new cast of local characters led by a vivacious six - year - old girl named @entity22 who loves cricket and traditional @entity15 music			1
come and play ! new characters in @entity15 's version of @entity14 are prepared for filming in @entity27			1
the programme is hoped to fight the radicalisation of children final touch : taking @entity14 to @entity15 comes at a critical time when the @entity17 is trying to counter the tide of @entity35 fundamentalism in the country her sidekick , @entity37 , is a five - year - old boy obsessed with numbers and banging away on @entity15 bongo drums , or tabla			1
the @entity17 is bankrolling the initiative with $ 20 million , hoping it will improve education in a country where one - third of primary school - age children are not in class			1
@entity47 also hopes the program will increase tolerance at a time when the influence of radical views is growing			1
' one of the key goals of the show in @entity15 is to increase tolerance toward groups like women and ethnic minorities , ' said @entity60 , who was the head education officer for the @entity61 in @entity15 until very recently			2
the show , which started filming last week and will air at the end of november , was jointly developed by @entity63 , the creator of the @entity17 series , and @entity66 , a group in the @entity15 city of @entity27 that has been staging puppet shows for more than three decades			1
old favourite : @entity5 , left , will also star in the new version of the show but @entity71 and @entity72 , right , have not made the cut the @entity17 version of @entity14 first aired in 1969 , and the @entity17 government has worked with the company since then to produce shows in about 20 foreign countries , including @entity80 nations like @entity81 and @entity82			1
perhaps nowhere else are the stakes as high as in @entity15			2
the @entity17 is worried that growing radicalisation could one day destabilise the nuclear - armed country			1
@entity47 has committed to spend $ 7.5 billion in civilian aid in @entity15 over five years , despite accusations that the country is aiding insurgents in neighbouring @entity89			1
@entity22 , the new program 's star , sports pigtails and a blue and white school uniform			2
her innate curiosity is exemplified by the magnifying glass she often carries and her endless stream of questions			2
she is captain of the school cricket team and plays the harmonium , an instrument used to perform @entity101 music			2
the creators chose @entity22 as the lead character to emphasise the importance of sending girls to school , something that does n't often happen in @entity15 's conservative , male - dominated society , said @entity109 , the chief operating officer of @entity110 and one of several family members who run the organisation			2
' it makes the girl stand equally with the boy , which is very clear , ' said @entity109			2
@entity22 and @entity37 are joined by @entity7 the donkey , @entity10 the crocodile , and @entity120 , a spirited woman who serves as a mother figure for the others			0
@entity5 , the lovable , red , child monster , is the only traditional @entity14 character on the show , which is called @entity127 , or @entity128			0
the action centres around a mock - up of a @entity15 town , complete with houses , a school and @entity120 's dhaba , a small shop and restaurant found in many places in the country			0
the town also includes a large @entity140 tree , known as the wisdom tree in @entity142 , in the shade of which the children often play			0
given the intense ethnic and regional divisions within @entity15 , the creators tried to build a set that was recognizable to @entity15 children but did not stand out as being from one part of the country			0
for similar reasons , the skin colors of the puppets range from very light brown to orange			0
a total of 78 episodes will be aired in @entity15 's national language , @entity158 , over the next three years , as well as 13 in each of the four main regional languages , @entity160 , @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163			0
the shows will appear on @entity15 state television , and the producers hope they will reach 3 million children , one million of whom are out of school			0
they also plan radio programs and 600 live puppet performances they hope will reach millions more kids and parents			0
each episode will be based around a word and a number , like the @entity17 version , and will tackle general themes like friendship , respect and valuing diversity			1
this last theme is particularly important in @entity15 , where @entity185 extremists often target minority religious sects and others who disagree with their views			0
' there are many situations where we coexist peacefully , and that 's what we want to focus on , ' said @entity194 , the show 's head writer			0
the program will feature holidays celebrated by @entity80 , @entity198 and @entity199 in an attempt to get children to respect the traditions of different religious groups in @entity15 , said @entity109			0
@entity17 officials stressed they were not involved in creating content for the show			1
the @entity17 is extremely unpopular in @entity15 , and suspicions run high about @entity17 manipulation in the country			1
the creators realize that there is some risk of militant backlash			0
events held by @entity110 have been attacked several times in the past , including a world arts festival in 2008 that was hit by three small bomb blasts that wounded at least half a dozen people			0
' we ca n't just stop because of this fear , ' said @entity109			0
troubled : @entity15 is plagued by @entity35 fundamentalists and political rivalries which frequently lead to acts of terrorism			0
