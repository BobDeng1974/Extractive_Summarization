i ’m really excited about the @entity2 squad @entity3 has selected and delighted to see @entity4 and @entity5 involved again			1
this is a momentous year for @entity8 rugby with a @entity9 just around the corner and i ’m pleased @entity11 has been bold enough to select two of the @entity14 ’s form players in a squad full of high - quality test match animals			1
@entity2 may be missing a few players through injury but they have so much depth that there are no excuses for underperforming in this @entity22			1
it ’s time to deliver			2
@entity4 was given a surprise call up to @entity2 's training squad ahead of the @entity22 @entity2 head coach @entity3 named his training squad at @entity27 on wednesday @entity28 ; a @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 ; @entity33 , @entity34 ; a @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 ; @entity38 , @entity39 ; @entity40 ( capt ) , @entity42 , @entity43 they have more talent available than any of the other home unions and i ca n’t wait to see a bold , attacking @entity2 team with a clear direction of how they want to play and a clear selection policy based on attack - minded players who want to take the game to the opposition			1
@entity4 definitely falls into that category and i ’m delighted to see him included			1
i have watched so many high - class fly - halves down the years , with @entity57 unquestionably being the best to have played for @entity2			1
but @entity4 is the only @entity8 no 10 of the past 20 years who , if i ’d been coach and he had been up for selection at the same time as @entity57 , could have caused big selection headaches			1
@entity5 was also recalled to the @entity2 set - up despite being in international exile since 2011 @entity11 is flanked by forwards coach @entity64 ( left ) and back coach @entity65 ( right ) the @entity68 man ’s skill - set is so complete			1
he poses an attacking threat with ball in hand and has a superb kicking game and world - class distribution			2
i think @entity57 would have got the nod over him in the end but the fact i even mention them in the same breath shows how highly i rate @entity4			1
if @entity2 are to capitalise on their world - class pack they have to pick a fly - half who will instil fear in the opposition			1
@entity85 has enormous potential , a great attitude and all the skills required to take the ball flat to the line and challenge opponents on the gainline			0
@entity4 provides @entity2 with an attacking threat as well as having world - class distribution @entity57 is widely regarded as the best fly - half to ever play for @entity2 but if there ’s one @entity8 fly - half opposition teams would not want to play against at the moment then it ’s @entity4			1
he ’s also got the edge in experience			0
for me , he ’s simply the best fly - half in the country right now and he ’d be in my xv for the opener against @entity108 on february 6			0
it ’s interesting that @entity3 has gone for four fly - halves instead of three and i wonder if there was some last - minute tinkering			0
but the real test will be when he picks his 23 for @entity114 in what is going to be one of the biggest @entity22 games in living memory			0
there ’s so much riding on that contest , not just for the @entity22 but also with the @entity9 pool game coming up in september			1
it can not be overstated how important it is for @entity2 to win next month because if they lose , they will be behind the eight ball for the rest of the championship			1
that ’s why i want to see them pick a side to really attack @entity108			0
@entity2 need to play flat to the line and challenge the @entity132 defence			1
the exciting aspect is that there are so many players in form at the moment with @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity141 all flying in @entity142			1
@entity143 in action for @entity140 during a @entity146 match against @entity147 @entity85 kicks at goal during an autumn international clash with @entity150 at @entity27 in november how will @entity2 choose to play ? @entity139 proved in their fantastic win over @entity152 at the weekend that there are @entity8 - qualified players who are capable of shredding defences with their pace and skills — @entity158 was absolutely outstanding at outside centre			1
i ’d pick @entity30 against @entity108 alongside his @entity139 team - mate @entity161			1
i ’d then insist on the @entity163 roof being shut to ensure perfect conditions			0
then i ’d order my team to go out and attack			0
it ’s going to be fascinating to see if @entity11 can hold his nerve when it comes to whittling down his squad and i ’ll be disappointed if he reverts to a conservative selection policy			2
@entity174 forward @entity173 was overlooked for the training squad by @entity3 @entity176 is one of four fly - halves that have been included in the training squad for the @entity22 this is not the year for ‘ @entity182 ’ selection — this is the year to risk everything in the quest for gold			2
i ’d even add wing @entity187 and scrum - half @entity143 to my squad and team			2
this is his time for @entity11 to show the country he is capable of coaching a team to the ultimate glory			0
i ’ve no doubt he ’ll be energised and excited about that prospect and the critical thing now is that he remains bold and clear in his selection			0
he needs to pick a tough , uncompromising team capable of scaring opponents and with @entity205 such as @entity35 back in the fold there ’s no doubt he has a pack that will pose problems for anyone			0
@entity5 ’s return is welcome			2
it ’s a huge achievement for a player of 36 to force his way back into contention after a three - and - a - half - year absence			0
he looks fit and in good shape and while he may not be the quickest no 8 in the country , he does possess excellent footballing skills and bags of experience			0
@entity226 kicks a penalty for @entity138 in their @entity146 tie with @entity229 in @entity230 it ’s testament to @entity233 ’s mental strength that he ’s never given up on playing for @entity2 again			1
i hope all that nonsense about what he may or may not have said after the @entity9 quarter - final defeat in 2011 has been well and truly put to bed			2
i ’d still have gone for @entity173 — who is proving time after time at @entity174 that he is a world - class operator — but @entity233 is a bold selection and the next best thing			2
so , all in all , i ’m encouraged by this squad			2
this year is rugby ’s equivalent of the @entity245			0
it ’s rugby ’s year			0
and the challenge for @entity11 and his coaching team is to pick a team of which the nation can be proud and which opponents will fear			0
the talent is there , no question			0
this squad is a great start			2
the next two weeks are going to be crucial ahead of what is a massive , massive game			0
the question is : will they hold their nerve ?			0

@entity4 and @entity5 were both given @entity9 *lifelines*
@entity4 has been recalled for his superb form with @entity269
@entity233 has not featured for @entity2 since the @entity271
@entity158 's hot streak for @entity139 means he is retained in the squad
