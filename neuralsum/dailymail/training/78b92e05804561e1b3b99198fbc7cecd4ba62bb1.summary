she left behind her daughter and two sons as well as her second husband @entity44			1
hailed as a heroine of the 21st century , her death has prompted much soul - searching in a country ravaged by violence			0
the decision to withdraw her security team in november last year – and her police escort in january – has come under particular @entity53 was elected as mayor of @entity55 , a rural district in @entity57 , west of @entity58 , in 2008			1
almost immediately , she received threats			0
the first assassination attempt came in october 2009 when the car she was travelling in with her first husband @entity62 came under fire from gunmen in the town of @entity66			0
the attack claimed his life but @entity1 lived			1
she battled back from her injuries in the face of overwhelming tragedy , but she was not destined to know peace			0
the next attempt on her life was just three months later , when an masked group carrying assault rifles ambushed her on the road between @entity57 and @entity79 state			0
the van she was traveling in was peppered by 30 bullets			0
this time her wounds were more severe , leaving multiple scars and forcing her to wear a colostomy bag			0
she was left in constant pain			0
but with unimaginable courage – and despite being a marked woman – she remained defiant to the very end			0
murder : the corpse of dr @entity1 , found by farm workers from @entity40			1
she had been burned , beaten and stabbed scene of the crime : @entity41 , close to where her corpse was discovered and @entity23 , where she was kidnapped when some doubted that she had been shot , @entity1 bared the scars that riddled her flesh and swore she would never give in			1
in a statement to the public made at the time , the devout @entity99 said : ' at another stage in my life , perhaps i would have resigned from what i have , my position , my responsibilities as the leader of my @entity55			0
' but today , no. it is not possible for me to surrender when i have three children , whom i have to educate by setting an example , and also because of the memory of the man of my life , the father of my three little ones , the one who was able to teach me the value of things and to fight for them			2
' although he is no longer with us , he continues to be the light that guides my decisions			0
' she added : ' i struggle day to day to erase from my mind the images of the horror i lived , and that others who did not deserve or expect it also suffered			0
@entity129 discovery : residents of the community of @entity40 found her body as they went to work in the fields ' i wanted to show them my wounded , mutilated , humiliated body , because i ’m not ashamed of it , because it is the product of the great misfortunes that have scarred my life , that of my children and my family			2
' ' despite my own safety and that of my family , what occupies my mind is my responsibility towards my people , the children , the women , the elderly and the men who break their souls every day without rest to find a piece of bread for their children			2
' freedom brings with it responsibilities and i do n’t dare fall behind			0
my long road is not yet finished - the footprint that we leave behind in our country depends on the battle that we lose and the loyalty we put into it			0
' after her ordeal she remarried and ran for a seat in @entity8 's @entity169 , but failed to gain the backing she needed			1
she remarried and dropped out of the public eye			0
but it was still almost inevitable that she would eventually pay for her bravery with her life @entity8 has been torn apart by murderous drug gangs since president @entity177 launched his drug offensive in 2006			1
more than 50,000 people have been killed in clashes between rival drug cartels and security forces and about two dozen mayors have been murdered			2
the cartels have ruled the streets with fear for years , enforcing their authority with murders , bribery and torture			0
but after decades of using force to combat the gangs , it is @entity195 lawmakers who are the criminals ' biggest problem			2
legalisation of marijuana , as recently voted for by @entity201 and @entity202 states , may wipe billions of dollars from the cartels ’ annual profits			0
and it has left politicians in @entity8 with a tough question : how can they continue to justify spending money – and lives – fighting drug distribution to @entity195 when it will be legal in some states from next month ? sickening : dr @entity1 shows the wounds she sustained from the ambushers ' gunfire and the subsequent car crash wounds : the ex-mayor was lucky to survive the second attack			1
she was left in constant pain and was forced to use a colostomy bag @entity8 presidential advisor @entity222 said in a radio interview last week : ' obviously , we ca n’t handle a product that is illegal in @entity8 , trying to stop its transfer to the @entity195 , when in the @entity195 , at least in part of the @entity195 , it now has a different status ' from january to september last year , 12,903 people were killed in the country in drug - related crime , ranging from gang members , @entity8 military and innocent victims caught up in gun battles			1
the @entity8 government claim they are winning the war on drugs , but few outside – or inside – the country believe that			1
so corrupt are their police that they are rarely employed in combating the cartels			0
instead , the country relies on its army to tackle the gangs while it attempts to rebuild its police forces			2
public support for the drug war continues to fall as the death toll rises and the cartels ’ profits rise			2
the business of trafficking drugs from @entity8 into the @entity195 is estimated to be a business worth between $ 13billion ( £ 8billion ) and $ 49billion ( £ 30billion ) , with 90 per cent of all cocaine used in @entity195 originating from the country , according to a @entity195 state report			1
icon : @entity1 was described by a prominent @entity8 journalist as ' a heroine of the 21st century ' casualty of war : dr @entity1 is the latest official murdered by cartels in @entity8 's bloody battle over drugs the @entity271 considers the cartels as @entity195 ’s greatest organised crime threat , while conceding that it is @entity195 dollars that fund the crime ravaging @entity8			1
in 2009 a military assessment predicted that if the drugs war continued for another 25 years , @entity8 ’s government was at serious risk of collapse and the conflict would spread into @entity195			1
a year earlier , the @entity281 suggested a similar time - scale of collapse in @entity8 and warned @entity195 intervention may be necessary due to the implications for homeland security			1
the problem of strengthening the @entity8 / @entity195 border even prompted president @entity289 to deploy 1,200 @entity291 troops in 2010			1
the two major cartels in @entity8 are now the @entity293 and @entity294			1
the @entity293 was formed when several gangs agreed to join forces in 2006 and is now led by @entity298 ' @entity297			2
he is @entity8 's most wanted drug trafficker and is believed to be worth $ 1billion			1
@entity300 magazing even declared him the 55th most powerful man in the world in 2009			2

consisting of @entity307 and @entity308 of @entity310 members , they helped control parts of @entity8 for the @entity306 until its leader , @entity312 , was arrested			1
