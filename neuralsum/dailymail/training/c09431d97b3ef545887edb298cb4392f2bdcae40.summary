by @entity0 published : 17:45 est , 10 march 2013 updated : 17:48 est , 10 march 2013 @entity1 was embroiled in a battle with the new archbishop of @entity4 last night			1
the @entity5 told @entity7 leaders there was ‘ nothing moral ’ about their opposition to flagship welfare reforms			1
he reacted with fury after the @entity14 @entity13 led an uprising against the government ’s plans to limit benefit increases to one per cent a year for the next three years			2
mr @entity1 , a devout @entity19 , insisted it was neither fair nor moral to trap millions of families on welfare payments which made it not worth their while seeking work			1
the intervention of 43 bishops threatens the biggest row between the government and the @entity7 since the @entity28 was formed in 2010			1
collision course : archbishop @entity13 and welfare secretary @entity1			1
defending welfare reforms , mr @entity1 told the @entity7 that there is ' nothing moral ' about trapping people on benefits mr @entity1 is understood to be particularly angered because at a private meeting last week the new archbishop made no mention of his concern about the benefit cap , let alone the @entity7 ’s plan to launch a public assault on it			1
the @entity28 has announced that increases in out - of - work benefits and some tax credits will be limited to one per cent for the next three years , a move which will save more than £ 2billion a year			1
traditionally , benefits have been increased in line with the rate of inflation			2
that prompted uproar last year , when the formula meant their value increased by more than five per cent at a time when many working families had to contend with pay freezes or below - inflation rises			1
the @entity28 ’s @entity59 , passed by a big majority in the @entity61 , will affect single parents on benefits most			0
they will lose on average £ 5 a week			0
working households receiving state support in the form of tax credits will be an average of £ 3 a week worse off , though the @entity69 insists this will be more than cancelled out by record increases in the basic - rate income tax allowance			0
secretary of state for work and pensions @entity1 says that the benefits bill rose 60 per cent to £ 200billion under @entity75 , an unfair burden on taxpayers a letter signed by 43 bishops and endorsed by the new archbishop of @entity4 and the archbishop of @entity82 claimed that capping benefit rises would have a ‘ deeply disproportionate ’ effect on children			1
' people who are paying taxes , working very hard , have hardly seen any increases in their salary and yet , under the last government , the welfare bill rose by some 60 per cent to £ 200billion			0
' - @entity1 the welfare bill will be debated in the @entity93 next week and bishops in the house have tabled an amendment in an attempt to exempt all child - related benefits and tax credits			1
archbishop @entity13 , in his first significant political intervention , said the reforms could push 200,000 children into poverty , adding : ‘ as a civilised society , we have a duty to support those among us who are vulnerable and in need			1
when times are hard , that duty should be felt more than ever , not disappear or diminish			0
‘ it is essential that we have a welfare system that responds to need and recognises the rising costs of food , fuel and housing			0
‘ the current benefits system does that , by ensuring that the support struggling families receive rises with inflation			1
‘ these changes will mean it is children and families who will pay the price for high inflation , rather than the government			0
’ under the welfare reforms , increases in out - of - work benefits will be pinned back to one per cent a year for three years he added : ‘ politicians have a clear choice			1
by protecting children from the effects of this @entity139 , they can help fulfil their commitment to end child poverty			2
’ mr @entity1 , hitting back , said the government ’s legislation was ‘ about fairness ’			2
‘ people who are paying taxes , working very hard , have hardly seen any increases in their salary and yet , under the last government , the welfare bill rose by some 60 per cent to £ 200billion , ’ the @entity5 said			0
‘ that means they have to pay for that under their taxes , which is simply not fair			0
that same system trapped huge numbers , millions , in dependency , dependent on the state , unable , unwilling to work			0
' what is either moral or fair about that ? objection : the archbishop has led @entity7 protests against the cap , claiming it will push 200,000 children into poverty ‘ there is nothing moral or fair about a system that i inherited that trapped people in welfare dependency			1
some one in every five households has no work – that ’s not the way to end child poverty			0
‘ getting people back to work is the way to end child poverty			0
that ’s the moral and fair way to do it			0
’ @entity75 enshrined in law its measure of poverty – 60 per cent of median earnings – in law , and used tax credits to try to push families just over the line			2
incredibly , nine in every ten families with children ended up qualifying for credits			0
the last government set a target to reduce the number of children living in relative income poverty to 1.7million by 2010/11			2
this was not met , with a total of 2.3million that year			0
the @entity28 has now agreed to tear up @entity75 ’s definition – insisting that basing it purely on a crude measure of family income is perverse , when other factors can be just as critical in determining children ’s life chances			0
mr @entity1 suggests broader ways of calculating child poverty – including whether or not parents are in work , educational failure , family breakdown , problem debt , gambling and poor health			1
he insists that giving a family ‘ an extra pound in benefits ’ does not address their problems – and can even push a family further into difficulty if a parent spends the cash fuelling his or her dependency on alcohol or drugs			2
@entity13 ’s attack on the welfare reforms is the second time in recent years that the @entity7 has become embroiled in a political row			1
in june 2011 his predecessor as @entity163 , dr @entity235 , took @entity236 to task , questioning the democratic legitimacy of many of the @entity28 ’s flagship policies			0
the left - leaning @entity243 charity – which is allied to the @entity7 – came up with the figure of 200,000 children who would be pushed into poverty by the welfare @entity247 , such predictions are fraught with difficulties			1
the arbitrary nature of the current poverty measure – anything below 60 per cent of median earnings – means that the recession actually helped lift 300,000 children out of poverty without any meaningful change in their circumstances			2
it happened simply because average incomes fell			0
while some in government had wanted to freeze all benefits , mr @entity1 agreed to limit increases to one per cent a year while committing to raise certain benefits in line with inflation to protect the most vulnerable			1
these include benefits for carers and disability benefits such as attendance allowance , the disability elements of tax credits , disability living allowance and the support component of employment and support allowance			0
even with the welfare cap , government spending on benefits and tax credits is forecast to increase from £ 210billion to £ 218billion by 2015/16			2
the new universal credit , meanwhile , will make three million households better off			0
it is hard to disagree with mr @entity1 ’s central contention that the best way to help children out of poverty is not by giving their parents an extra pound a week to push them over an arbitrary line – but through work .			1

@entity1 has gone head - to - head with the @entity7 over benefits overhaul
@entity7 says capping benefit rises will push children into poverty
but welfare minister says the burden on taxpayers is not fair
