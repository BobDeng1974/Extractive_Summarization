by @entity0 and @entity1 a baby who was so big she became trapped during birth was saved by medics who broke her arm			1
weighing 10lb 15oz , @entity6 got stuck midway through the delivery , leaving her unable to breathe – and doctors feared she would be stillborn			1
but her life was saved after a quick - thinking consultant snapped her limb to free her and then battled for 12 minutes to get her breathing			1
healthy : @entity15 , now eight months old , has suffered no lasting damage from her maternity ward ordeal			1
her mother @entity18 , 26 , thought she was losing her daughter when she saw tears in in a midwife 's eyes @entity15 ’s mother @entity18 , 26 , from @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity26 , said : ‘ we knew @entity15 was on the big side but we did n’t know how big or i would not have risked a natural delivery			1
‘ she almost died and we were warned that because she had been starved of oxygen for so long she may have suffered brain damage			2
thank goodness she is perfect			2
but we know how lucky we have been			0
‘ i think they were a bit worried when they told me they ’d had to break @entity15 ’s arm , but i could n’t thank them enough … she would n’t be here today if they had n’t broken her arm			1
’ in may last year , 37 weeks into @entity44 ’s pregnancy , doctors induced labour due to complications with her blood type			0
but having had their first child @entity49 two years earlier , she and husband @entity48 were expecting a straightforward delivery			0
mrs @entity18 said : ‘ i ’d been told the second birth is always easier because your body knows what to do			0
’ the labour progressed quickly and everything went according to plan until after the baby ’s head had been delivered			2
‘ i could see people ’s faces change as they tried to deliver the rest of her but they could n’t , ’ mrs @entity18 said			0
‘ they kept moving me around and i was pushing with all my might but it made no difference			0
’ midwives called for emergency help after they suspected a case of shoulder dystocia , which means one or both of the baby ’s shoulders get stuck behind the mother ’s pelvis			1
the condition – which is common among larger babies – can be fatal			0
it became clear that both of @entity15 ’s shoulders were trapped and she was being starved of oxygen			1
mrs @entity18 said : ‘ alarm bells were ringing and people were running in and out like a scene from a film … i knew we were losing her because i could see tears in the eyes of one of the midwives			1
i begged them to do anything to save her			0
’ it was then that a consultant snapped the unborn baby ’s arm , freeing her so she could be delivered			1
x-ray : the break allowed trapped @entity15 to be delivered after her shoulders got trapped behind her mothers pelvis and she began to suffocate mrs @entity18 said she ‘ went into shock ’ because she was so convinced that her child had died			2
but in the corner of the room medics continued cpr on the baby until finally , after 12 minutes , she took her first breath			2
@entity15 was rushed to special baby care while medics were left to explain to her parents that her arm had been broken			1
mrs @entity18 said : ‘ we did n’t care at all about that			0
we were just so grateful that they had n’t given up on her			0
’ but the couple were warned that @entity15 may have suffered brain damage after being unable to breathe for so long			1
she was transferred to the @entity117 in @entity118 for pioneering cooling treatment to reduce the risk of brain injury			0
her mother said : ‘ i broke down when i saw her			0
‘ she looked perfect other than a splint on her little broken arm and lots of nail marks where people had tried so hard to free her			2
’ weak : @entity15 pictured in hospital with a tiny splint			2
her parents could not hold her for the first five days the anxious parents held vigil while @entity15 was treated over the next 72 hours			1
she began to breathe unaided and five days after the birth her parents were allowed to hold her for the first time			1
‘ it felt like a miracle , ’ mrs @entity18 said			0
‘ she had almost died but all she had to show for it was a broken arm			2
’ @entity15 was discharged five weeks later and is now a perfectly healthy eight - month - old girl			1
mrs @entity18 is now calling for increased growth screening in the later stages of pregnancy to prevent incidents like her daughter ’s			0
she is also walking 32 miles to raise money for @entity117			0

@entity6 got stuck as she was being born and could *n't* breathe
' i knew we were losing her because i could see tears in the midwives ' eyes '
consultant then reached in and snapped the baby 's arm to free her
@entity15 's parents , from @entity25 , could not hold her for the first five days
but now she is healthy and has suffered no lasting effects from her ordeal
