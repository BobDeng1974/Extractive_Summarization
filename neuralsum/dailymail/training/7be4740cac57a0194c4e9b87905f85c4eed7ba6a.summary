it may have seemed that mr @entity2 ’s tricorder would remain firmly in science fiction			2
but a gadget that can be used to diagnose an illness simply by holding it to the forehead , is now in the hands of consumers			1
named @entity10 , the small round device is able to read a number of vital signs , including heart rate and temperature			1
@entity10 is a small round device that is able to read five vital signs , including heart rate and temperature			1
its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds			2
most importantly , it is designed so that it does n't need to be used by doctors first unveiled at @entity26 last year , the @entity25 - based firm behind @entity10 won funding on crowdfunding site @entity28 and the first batch of devices were shipped in january			1
it contains a variety of different sensors alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget that together , can read vital signs , including body temperature , heart rate , blood oxygen level , heart rate variability and pulse wave transit time ( @entity44 )			1
@entity44 is the time it takes for a heartbeat to reach somewhere else in a person ’s body and is related to blood pressure			2
the tricorder was used by @entity2 ( pictured ) in @entity51 to wirelessly scanned a patient , either in a ‘ sick bay ’ on a star ship or during an away mission , to assess an individual ’s medical status , and allow him to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination the @entity10 contains a variety of different sensors alongside a microphone on the top of the gadget that can read five vital signs , including heart rate , body temperature , ecg and more ( shown above ) a tricorder is a scanning device used by @entity71 personnel in the @entity51 universe			1
there are two variations ; a regular ( engineering ) tricorder and a medical tricorder			0
medical tricorders are used to wirelessly scan a patient , either in a ‘ sick bay ’ on a star ship or during an away mission			0
the scanning tool can determine a patient ’s medical status , and allows doctors to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasion examination			0
the company 's website said : ' as if it is reading your mind , the @entity10 provides valuable data about your body			1
all that information just by placing it on your forehead			2
' its makers claim the device is 99 per cent accurate in less than 10 seconds			2
medical data is stored on a smartphone app that patients can use to monitor their health , or can be shared with doctors			0
the device uses a @entity107 adapter that can be hooked into a usb port , and it takes less than an hour to charge the battery			2
when it is being used a few times every day , the battery lasts for about a week , the firm says			0
@entity113 , a @entity114 entrepreneur based at @entity116 ’s @entity115 in @entity117 , who is behind the device , was inspired by @entity121 ’s tricorder			1
‘ @entity51 was more than just a movie , it was a business plan , ’ he told @entity123 ’s @entity122			1
the @entity126 was used by the doctor in @entity51 to wirelessly scan a patient , either in a ‘ sick bay ’ on a star ship or during an away mission , to assess an individual ’s medical status , and allow him to quickly and easily diagnose their condition without an intensive or invasive examination			2
first unveiled at @entity26 last year , the @entity25 based firm behind @entity10 won funding on crowd funding site @entity28 and the first batch of devices were shipped in january			1
users must hold the device against their forehead to take readings however , @entity10 was designed to be used by non-medical professionals			1
@entity113 said : ‘ we 've medicalised your smartphone			0
you can now check your health as easily as your email			0
‘ people will no longer ask if there 's a doctor on the plane , but if there 's a tricorder			0
’ the device is not yet able to be purchased and is pending @entity160 approval , but some people who obtained the device via @entity28 have taken to @entity163 to share their thoughts			1
@entity10 is a finalist in the @entity166 , which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases , like a @entity126 ( pictured ) @entity170 tweeted : ‘ it 's finally here			1
accurate readings of @entity175 temp and @entity176			0
# @entity177 # cdom ’ @entity10 is also working on another device called @entity179 – a urine test that could be used at home			1
but @entity183 thinks in just a decade from now , we will be using silicon lasers to diagnose ailments so that medical data could be taken simply by passing through a beam			0
@entity10 is a finalist in the @entity166 , which was launched in 2013 to inspire a wireless device capable of detecting a range of diseases , including anaemia , tuberculosis and diabetes			1
according to the rules , finalists must demonstrate their devices on humans this year and three winners will be announced in 2016 , with a top prize of £ 4.3 million ( $ 7 million )			0
to win the cash prize , the device has to monitor vital signs as well as diagnose 16 different conditions			1
another device by @entity207 - based , @entity205 , uses computer - vision techniques to analyse images taken with a camera			2
the scientists hope their system will make observations of the inside of the ears or throat , say – in the same way a doctor would – and then feed it into a computer for analysis			0
other teams are using blood and urine samples to test for key markers			0
the tiny microfluidic devices will , they claim , work in a similar way to hospital - lab tests			0
@entity231 , for instance , has teamed teamed up with @entity116 to create a device that astronauts could use to monitor their health on long trips and in zero gravity			2
doctors and medical engineers point out that much of the technology is already proven available to use separately			0
for instance , light sensors can now track blow flow and oxygen levels within the human body			0
other sensors can be used to detect gases in breath that may indicate certain diseases			0
@entity249 are the youngest team competing for the @entity250			0
@entity252 's solution is a monitoring device ( pictured ) designed to gather five different vital signs at once , to be worn around the neck			1

device is able to read vital signs when it is held to the forehead
these include : heart rate , body temperature and *respiratory* rate
gadget won @entity28 funding and the first gadgets shipped in january
the @entity10 was inspired by mr @entity270 in @entity51
