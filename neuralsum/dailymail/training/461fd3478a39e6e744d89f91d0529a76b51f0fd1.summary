by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 10:34 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 04:04 est , 17 january 2014 a leukaemia patient who was denied ‘ life - changing ’ hair replacement therapy on the @entity5 has spoken of her delight after a @entity8 reader gave her the treatment for free			1
@entity10 , 29 , developed alopecia after twice battling leukaemia			1
she applied to the @entity5 for £ 2,000 treatment to improve the appearance of her patchy hair three times but was denied it each time			1
@entity10 , 29 , had hair replacement therapy after it was offered to her free of charge by @entity20 , a hair loss expert , who read about ms @entity10 on @entity8 ms @entity10 ( pictured left before her hair loss ) developed alopecia ( right ) after two battles with leukaemia			1
she applied to have hair replacement therapy on the @entity5 but was refused the treatment three times on the basis her case was not ' exceptional ' but when @entity8 covered her story in december , hair loss expert @entity20 offered to give ms @entity10 the treatment free of charge			1
after having the therapy last week , ms @entity10 , who has an eight - year - old daughter , is now delighted with her thick head of hair			1
she told @entity8 : ‘ i 'm really pleased with it – it feels like part of me already			2
‘ when i got the call to say @entity20 had offered to do it i was speechless			2
i did n’t know what to do – i was shocked			0
’ ms @entity10 ( pictured during her hair replacement therapy ) said : ' i was gobsmacked watching them do it			1
i was really nervous and excited and they were so lovely and friendly - they made me feel really comfortable ' designed for women with moderate to severe hair loss or thinning , this is a hair replacement prosthesis			1
it is constructed from a breathable mesh and integrated into the existing hair , without the need to cut or shave off any natural hair			0
it can be an effective way of managing both the later stages of hair loss and the short hair re-growth when treatment has finished			1
to begin with , the mesh is gently placed between the existing hair and the scalp			0
panels , made of ultra-fine mesh containing additional human hair , are then added to it to completely disguise any hair loss			2
to complete the look a parting is also added to the crown section			0
it allows the person to take part in sports , including swimming , without worrying about their hair			2
the hair can also be washed , brushed and styled as normal			0
the hair needs to be maintained every six to eight weeks			0
an initial consultation costs £ 55 and the treatment starts from £ 895			0

‘ i just want to say thank you to you for publishing it and to @entity20 – it would n’t have happened otherwise			2
’ ms @entity10 , an administration worker who was training to be a nurse until she was taken ill , was first diagnosed with leukaemia in august 2005			1
she underwent two rounds of chemotherapy and had a bone marrow transplant			0
after this , her hair grew back fine			0
however , she relapsed in 2010 and had another two bouts of chemotherapy and another bone marrow transplant			0
this time she was treated with @entity104 which she thinks caused the alopecia , but it was the only treatment available to her at the time			2
as a result , she has applied repeatedly for hair replacement therapy on the @entity5 but the @entity110 , which advises on @entity5 spending , decided her case was not exceptional			1
ms @entity10 says the verdict crushed her remaining confidence			2
' hair makes a woman feel feminine , ' she said			2
' a lady who had a double mastectomy would not be refused a breast reconstruction			0
' yet someone who suffered alopecia due to intense chemotherapy is classed differently			0
’ when @entity8 ran ms @entity10 ’s story in december , it was greeted with outrage from readers who felt the mother had been treated unfairly			1
the day after the story was published , we were contacted by @entity20 , a hair loss expert who runs hair loss and extension studios across the country			1
she offered to give ms @entity135 the treatment for free			2
the hair replacement therapy , called the @entity139 system , lasts two years			1
it works by fitting a mesh over any area with little or no hair , pulling the existing hair through the mesh and plaiting tiny wefts of fine real hair to it			0
unlike normal hair extensions , it does n't place stress on the remaining strands			0
ms @entity10 , from @entity153 , travelled to @entity154 for the treatment which took a whole day			1
she said : ‘ i was gobsmacked watching them do it			0
i was really nervous and excited but they were so lovely and friendly			0
they made me feel really comfortable			0
’ ms @entity10 ( pictured before the hair replacement therapy ) hated wearing a wig as she found it hot and itchy and she worried that people were staring at her and wondering if she was wearing a wig ms @entity10 ( pictured with her daughter , @entity87 , before her hair loss ) said : ' my daughter loves it - the first thing she did was start plaiting it ' ms @entity10 says she is delighted to be able to leave behind the wig she has been wearing for three years			1
she said : ‘ i wo n’t have to think about the hot , itchy wig any more			0
the hair will make me much more confident as i wo n’t worry that people are looking at me and wondering if i am wearing a wig			0
’ ms @entity10 says she is now looking forward to celebrating her 30th birthday next month with her new hairdo			2
dr @entity178 , chairman of @entity179 , which spends almost £ 1m a day on the city ’s healthcare , said at the time ms @entity10 was refused @entity5 help : ' the decision in this case was made following detailed assessment by a panel of clinicians who took into account a wide range of factors			1
' in general , we need to prioritise limited funding based on the needs of the local population and we do this as fairly and equitably as possible			0
' when @entity8 ran ms @entity10 ’s story in december , it was greeted with outrage from readers who felt the mother had been treated unfairly			1
when @entity8 ran ms @entity10 's story in december ( pictured ) , it was greeted with outrage from readers who felt the mother had been treated unfairly frustrated , from @entity204 , wrote : ' @entity205 , the @entity5 will pay for a boob job to enhance an already acceptable bust yet will not pay for an embarrassing condition caused by illness beyond anyone 's control			1
pathetic ! ' @entity212 , from @entity213 , commented : ' was n't there a story a few months back about a woman getting a breast enlargement on the @entity5 to become a topless model ? ? ! costing say £ 5000 and now she wants a reduction			2
but this poor woman ca n't have a procedure for £ 2000 to help her feel more confident about herself after battling a serious disease ? ? ! something wrong with this country ! ! ' @entity8 readers were shocked that ms @entity10 was not offered hair replacement therapy on the @entity5 when other women had previously been given breast enlargement surgery			1

@entity10 developed alopecia after her second battle with cancer
she applied three times to have hair replacement therapy on the @entity5
her *requests* were rejected as her case was not *deemed* ' exceptional '
@entity8 covered the story in december and hair loss expert @entity20 offered to carry out the treatment free of charge after reading it
ms @entity10 now has a full head of hair which she says is ' amazing '
said : ' it feels like part of me already . it ’s amazing - i feel quite emotional '
