the chairman of a @entity2 committee investigating the 2012 terror attacks on @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , on thursday called former secretary of state @entity7 to testify at a public hearing next month			1
the move will set up a high - profile showdown over @entity12 's use of a private email account and server while she was secretary of state – and allow the @entity15 to rehash questions about her performance before and after the deadly assault on a diplomatic compound and a @entity22 annex nearby			1
@entity24 @entity23 rep. @entity23 said he wants @entity12 to testify the week of may 18 and again before june 18			1
hot seat : @entity26 presidential candidate @entity7 will testify in public about the @entity5 debacle , and about her exclusive use of a home - brew email server while she was secretary of state no comment : @entity7 stared ahead and walked wordlessly tuesday through a @entity33 airport , refusing to acknowledge her first campaign - trail question about the deadly @entity5 terror attacks in 2012 deadly : the september 11 , 2012 @entity5 terror attacks killed four @entity4 including the @entity4 ambassador to @entity6 the first hearing would focus on @entity12 's use of private emails , and the second on the september 2012 attacks that killed four @entity4 , including the @entity4 ambassador to @entity6			1
' with her cooperation and that of the @entity46 and ( @entity48 ) administration , secretary @entity12 could be done with the @entity49 before the @entity50 , ' @entity23 said in a statement			1
it is necessary to call @entity12 to appear twice ' because the committee needs to ensure we have a complete and responsive record and all the facts before we then substantively question her on the @entity5 terrorist attacks , ' @entity23 said			1
@entity59 : ' the fact is we had four dead @entity4 , ' @entity12 said during a 2013 @entity62 hearing			2
' was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they ’d they go kill some @entity4 ? what difference at this point does it make ? ' not forgotten : @entity4 @entity70 the @entity6 @entity71 was the first to die in @entity5 , and was seen by @entity6 as a moderate – angering anti-american hardliners from radical @entity74 groups @entity12 dodged questions about the @entity5 attacks on tuesday after landing in @entity33 following a two - day presidential campaign swing in @entity78			1
@entity79 asked her in the @entity81 if she had made mistakes handling the crisis , and when she would be ready to start answering reporters ' questions			0
@entity12 , steely - eyed , looked forward and walked silently without uttering a word			2
@entity23 's action comes a day after the @entity15 - led panel signaled its final report could slip to next year , just months before the presidential election			2
@entity12 is widely considered the front - runner for the @entity26 nomination for president			2
@entity23 spokesman @entity94 said on wednesday that @entity23 wants to complete the panel 's work by the end of the year , but said factors including witness availability , compliance with document requests and security clearances ' could continue to impact the timing of the inquiry 's conclusion			0
' a lawyer for @entity12 said she is prepared to answer questions publicly regarding the @entity5 attacks and her email use as soon as possible			1
' there is no reason to delay her appearance or to have her testify in a private interview , ' lawyer @entity110 said wednesday in a letter to @entity23			2
@entity12 has twice testified before @entity117 on the @entity5 matter , telling lawmakers in 2013 that she takes responsibility for missteps by the @entity46 in the months leading up to the assault			0
but @entity12 insisted that requests for more security at the diplomatic mission in @entity5 did n't reach her desk , and reminded lawmakers that they have a responsibility to fund security - related budget requests			0
@entity131 : @entity4 foreign service information management officer @entity137 ( left ) , @entity132 ( center ) and @entity4 @entity136 seal @entity134 ( right ) perished in the @entity139 attacks in @entity5 protest : congressional interns carried photographs of @entity134 , @entity132 and @entity137 during a @entity144 news conference in july 2013 @entity145 : the fires in @entity5 have gone out , but not the @entity15 's zeal to tarnish @entity7 's political legacy with new questions about how it happened and why some details were allegedly covered up @entity23 's letter includes more than 100 questions he and other lawmakers may pose to @entity12 about her email use , including why she considered using a private server and what was done to vet the companies or individuals who set up the server			1
and still lingering , too , are uneasy questions about why @entity12 initially blamed the @entity166 on a spontaneous protest sparked by an anti-muslim @entity169 video produced in the @entity4			0
@entity4 intelligence knew during the attack that it was launched by a terror group , @entity173 , which is affiliated with @entity174			0
months later , following a concussion that delayed her congressional testimony about @entity5 , she testified in a @entity4 @entity179 hearing			0
' the fact is we had four dead @entity4 , ' @entity12 told the senators			0
' was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they ’d they go kill some @entity4 ? ' ' what difference at this point does it make ? ' rep. @entity190 of @entity191 , senior @entity192 on the @entity5 panel , said the focus on email comes after ' @entity15 ' multi-year search for evidence to back up their @entity5 conspiracy theories has turned up nothing			0
' @entity190 accused @entity23 and other @entity15 of a ' coordinated attempt ' to ' drag out this taxpayer - funded search for anything they can use against @entity7 , while their political arm raises campaign funds off the deaths of four @entity4			0
