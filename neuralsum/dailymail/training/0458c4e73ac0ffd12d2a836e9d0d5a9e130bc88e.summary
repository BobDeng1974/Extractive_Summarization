by @entity0 published : 12:55 est , 5 march 2013 updated : 04:50 est , 6 march 2013 cry for help : a letter from an 11 - year - old telling of her fears at having her ' private cut ' has been published by campaigners against female genital mutilation a heart - breaking letter from an 11 - year - old girl begging for a charity for help to avoid female genital mutilation reveals the very real threat for many girls in the @entity17			1
the girl ’s cry for help was prompted by her discovery that her 12 - year - old sister had been taken to her grandmother ’s home in @entity24 , @entity25 for the procedure			1
' i really hope you can help me , not to have my private cut , ' she writes after discovering her sister 's horrific fate			2
the letter , sent in 2010 , was today published by campaigners in a bid to alert teachers to the importance of reporting suspicions of female genital mutilation ( @entity39 ) to the authorities			1
in the letter to charity @entity43 , the 11 - year - old girl says her sister ‘ had her private cut ’ by her aunties and grandmother in their native @entity24			1
she explains how her mother , sisters and brothers came to the @entity17 from west @entity25 in 2005 to join her father who was studying at university in the @entity17			1
five years later , as the family was watching a ‘ tv programme on @entity55 culture showing girls having their privates cut ’ , she describes how her sister suddenly burst into tears and a few days later told their father what had happened			1
‘ she said it was done one weekend by my aunties at my nans house			2
last friday mum took her to our gp to have her checked and the doctor said it was done to her			2
’ according to the 11 - year - old ’s letter , the older sister had been told ‘ the spirits will come and kill her immediately ’ if she spoke of the procedure			1
the little girl got in touch with the charity after telling one of her school teachers , who directed her to @entity43			1
‘ please madam help me , and my dad , ’ she begs			2
‘ i really hope you can help me , not to have my private cut			2
’ ‘ i am reallye confused expessically seeing my dad so un-happy and not knowing what to do			0
( sic ) ’ after they received the letter in 2010 , the charity contacted police and the girl is now believed to be safe			1
no prosecution has been brought but this is believed to be due to the perpetrators , the girl ’s aunts and grandmother , being overseas at the time police were alerted , and difficulty obtaining evidence			1
heartbreaking letter : ' please madam help me , and my dad , ' she begs			1
' i really hope you can help me , not to have my private cut ' ‘ practising communities think that the @entity17 does n’t have the guts to prevent and prosecute for @entity39 , ’ @entity102 , director of @entity43 ’s campaign against @entity39 , told the @entity104			1
‘ the key reasons for the lack of prosecutions are the young age of those involved and the fact that @entity39 is a hidden practice within families and affected communities			1
’ following the revelation in her letter that her teacher advised her to contact the charity instead of reporting the incident , @entity102 , director of @entity43 ’s campaign against @entity39 , warned teachers that they must alert authorities if a child displays any indication of having fallen victim of female genital mutilation			1
‘ if ( teachers ) and other frontline professionals do this , we will get prosecutions and come closer to ending this horrific abuse , ’ ms @entity102 added			1
female gender mutilation was made illegal in 1985 in the @entity17 but @entity43 estimates that 24,000 girls in the @entity17 are at risk			1
