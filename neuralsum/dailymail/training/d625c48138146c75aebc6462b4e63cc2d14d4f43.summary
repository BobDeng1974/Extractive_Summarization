by @entity1 reporter criticised : trendy @entity3 clothing giant @entity2 has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for an advert which ' appeared to sexualise a child ' - a week after falling foul of the same issue trendy @entity3 clothing giant @entity2 has been criticised by the advertising watchdog for an advert which ' appeared to sexualise a child ' - a week after falling foul of the same issue			1
the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) upheld two complaints about the advert , which appeared on the back cover of @entity15			1
it pictured a girl sitting on an office chair wearing a jumper , knickers and knee - length socks			1
she was posed with her legs up on the chair and her knickers were visible			1
the latest ruling comes a week after the clothing brand fell foul of the @entity12 with campaigns featuring ' gratuitous ' images and the sexualisation of models who appeared to be under 16			2
@entity2 ran into similar issues with campaigns in 2009 and earlier this year			0
the people who complained about the advert on the back of @entity15 objected that it was offensive and irresponsible			1
@entity2 denied that , saying the model featured was over 18 and was wearing products that were meant for adult consumers			0
they said they placed the ad in @entity15 , a publication written for adults , and the model wore clothes which were available for sale in their stores and online , in this case underwear and a sweater			2
@entity15 also did not believe the advert was offensive or irresponsible			2
they said it featured a woman wearing socks , underwear and a top and there was nothing to suggest anything overtly sexual or inappropriate was being portrayed			0
they also pointed out it contained no nudity			0
@entity2 has since confirmed to them that the model was over 18			0
problems : @entity2 ran into similar issues with campaigns in 2009 and earlier this year the @entity12 said the model pictured appeared to be young and potentially under the age of 16			1
it said : ' whilst we acknowledged the image did not contain any explicit nudity , we considered that the amateur style of the photo , the posing of the model with her legs up on an office style chair with her knickers showing and the unsmiling expression on the model ’s face meant the photo would be interpreted as having sexual undertones and a voyeuristic quality			1
' we concluded the ad inappropriately sexualised a model who appeared to be a child and was therefore irresponsible			0
' we had not seen demographic data for @entity15 but understood it was intended for an adult audience			2
however , we concluded that because it appeared to sexualise a child the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread offence in a magazine that was untargeted and freely available			0
removed : this image on the @entity2 website was ruled offensive by the @entity12 banned : bosses at @entity2 were previously ordered to ditch this image used on its website after the @entity12 ruled it was offensive ' the ad must not appear again in its current form			2
we told @entity2 not to depict any model as inappropriately sexualised who could , through their appearance or styling , appear to be a child			0
' a spokesman for @entity2 said : ' it ’s unfortunate that the @entity12 has made this ruling as our models are clearly of age and were featured in @entity15 , a publication clearly intended for mature , fashion forward audiences			1
' obviously we ’ll abide by this ruling as we have in the past with similar @entity12 decisions , but @entity2 will not be altering our classic advertising aesthetic which is internationally recognised for its artistic and social values			0
