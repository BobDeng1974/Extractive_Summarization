@entity0 closed the gap on @entity2 to just two points at the top of @entity5 , but will be praying injuries to @entity7 and @entity8 do n't derail their season			1
both @entity0 stars were substituted as @entity12 's side struggled to overcome a spirited @entity13 , who had chances to snatch a draw			1
@entity17 missed a penalty but provided goals for @entity20 and @entity21 , before adding the third himself , as @entity0 kept within touching distance of league leaders @entity2			1
@entity20 celebrates scoring for @entity0 in the 24th - minute against @entity13 @entity0 captain @entity20 celebrates with his team - mate @entity17 @entity21 made it 2 - 0 for @entity0 in the 69th - minute after @entity17 had missed a penalty @entity13 then pulled one back but @entity17 look delighted after making up for his earlier miss to make it 3 - 1 @entity0 : @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity20 , @entity32 , @entity33 ( @entity34 76 ' ) , @entity35 , @entity21 , @entity8 ( @entity36 60 ' ) , @entity37 , @entity17 , @entity7 ( @entity38 5 ' ) subs not used : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 booked : @entity33 , @entity35 goals : @entity20 24 ' @entity45 ' @entity17 90 ' @entity13 : @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 ( @entity54 ' ) , @entity55 ( @entity56 81 ' ) , @entity57 ( @entity58 87 ) , @entity59 subs not used : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 booked : @entity50 , @entity54 goals : @entity59 71 ' after just four minutes , @entity7 's game was over			1
the @entity67 tenderly touched his calf and made a pulling motion with his hands to the bench as he left the pitch , which might imply internal muscle damage			0
given that @entity75 was injured after a brutal @entity77 encounter with @entity79 rivals @entity78 in midweek , @entity7 's injury took the famous " @entity81 " strikeforce just down to @entity82 that 's the grade you 'd give it too , in 2015 , when compared to the performances of @entity2 's trio			1
@entity37 came in for @entity75 , with the @entity88 's injury solving a problem that was brewing at @entity0 , with @entity12 having to choose between the former @entity13 man , and @entity21			1
the latter was chosen over the former to face @entity78 , leading to stories of angst on @entity37 's part , but the issue was resolved by @entity75 's timely absence			0
@entity8 , meanwhile , was taken out by a @entity53 challenge in the second half			1
it was n't too fierce a tackle , but the @entity102 took a strong knock to his knee and is now a doubt for wednesday 's second leg against @entity78			0
@entity13 , having beaten @entity2 at @entity107 earlier this season , and drawn with champions @entity78 last week , are no @entity5 whipping boys and they came to the @entity110 with the belief they could win			2
@entity51 , on loan from @entity113 , charged forward battling with @entity31 , escaped the @entity0 defender and crossed for @entity59 , but the forward could n't connect and the chance was gone			1
the @entity117 stung @entity30 ' fingertips with a strike from distance , the veteran stopper tipping his effort behind for a corner			0
@entity124 was forced into a similar save at the other end , spectacularly flicking a header from @entity7 's replacement , @entity38 , over the bar			2
@entity7 went down injured after less than five minutes at the @entity129 the @entity131 forward was forced to go off to be replaced in the early stages of proceedings @entity20 tucks the ball in to open the scoring for @entity0 at the @entity129 the defender slides on his knees in front of the @entity0 fans after netting @entity0 broke the deadlock in controversial fashion , when @entity17 fired in a free kick from the left and @entity20 rammed home from close range			1
the defender seemed fractionally offside , but despite @entity124 's cries , the goal was allowed to stand			0
the @entity149 goalkeeper was called into action again shortly afterwards , making a fine save down to his right from a @entity154 volley			0
with the most expensive player in the world off the pitch , the second most expensive was having fun			0
@entity17 pulled off a quite ridiculous backheel - nutmeg on @entity47			2
in the following minute @entity20 had the ball in the net again , nodding home a @entity35 free - kick , but this time the officials spotted he was offside and ruled it out			2
@entity13 flew down the other end and created a magnificent opportunity , which @entity57 blazed over the bar when he should have found the net			2
@entity59 's cross was half - cleared by @entity32 and @entity57 pounced , but lacked balance and spooned his strike off - target from eight yards			2
@entity51 , flying down the right early in the second half , tried to find @entity59 with a low cross , but it flew past the forward and @entity30 gathered it			2
@entity17 had the perfect opportunity to put the game beyond @entity13 when @entity154 was taken down in the box by @entity55 , but lacked his characteristic cool and fired the penalty against the left upright			1
@entity0 goalkeeper @entity30 dives to the floor to grab the ball against @entity13 during the @entity5 clash @entity0 forward @entity17 ( right ) in action against @entity13 's @entity52 at the @entity129 @entity0 manager @entity12 watches on from the sidelines during his side 's clash with @entity13 but @entity0 did n't have long to wait for their second , with @entity154 scoring in spectacular fashion just a minute later			1
he played two one - twos on the edge of the box with @entity37 and @entity17 , before lashing the ball into @entity124 's top right corner			0
game over ? not quite			0
@entity13 were straight down the other end and on the scoresheet , with @entity201 whipping the ball in from the right for @entity59 to head home			1
@entity51 had a chance to run through after a @entity32 mis - step - this was a rare poor performance for the @entity209 - but @entity35 resorted to a blatant kick to stop him			0
the @entity212 went into the book , with the foul a symbol of how @entity0 were struggling to prevent the @entity217 side from getting forward on the break			0
@entity17 saw his second - half penalty hit the post after @entity13 goalkeeper @entity124 had gone the right way @entity0 forward @entity17 looks frustrated after missing a penalty during the second half but @entity21 soon doubled @entity0 's lead just a couple of minutes after @entity17 had missed the penalty @entity17 celebrates after securing the 3 - 1 victory late on after @entity13 had pulled one back @entity17 's evening was saved on a personal level at the end , with @entity38 selflessly squaring the ball for the forward to tap home at the far post			1
his celebration was excessive , considering @entity0 had essentially won the game and it was a simple finish , but that 's what happens when you have to keep up with the @entity239			0
or in this case , the @entity240			0
the @entity242 had scored for @entity2 earlier , so @entity17 would have left frustrated had he not been able to replicate @entity244 's effort , grabbing his 39th goal of the season in @entity5 , and his 50th in all competitions			2
@entity17 became the first ever player to net 50 goals in five consecutive seasons , an incredible statistic , but @entity12 's mind will now turn to wednesday night and another incredible statistic			0
he has faced @entity78 seven times so far this season and not won a single game			0
will he be forced to try it without @entity8 and @entity7 in the eighth ?			1

@entity20 opened the scoring for @entity0 in the first half at the @entity129
@entity17 then hit the post with a penalty before @entity21 nets
@entity59 pulled one back for @entity13 but @entity17 scored late on to secure the win
@entity7 and @entity8 go off injured for @entity0
