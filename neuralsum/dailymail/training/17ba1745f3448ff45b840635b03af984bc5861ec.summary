adult elephants would usually do this but for orphans like @entity49 , humans have to step in yet in spite of their traumatic early months , the orphaned babies are just as playful and inquisitive as other youngsters and as a result , their human ' family ' is kept very busy indeed			1
released to mark @entity70 , the snaps reveal that each pint - sized pachyderm has his or her own personality , quirks and traits and can be playful , shy or boisterous			0
among the shyer babies is seven - week - old @entity51 , who was rescued after being attacked with stones and spears by villagers , furious after a local woman was killed by an adult elephant			2

‘ each orphan has their own tragic rescue story but their struggle of survival and zest for life is infectious , ’ says @entity148 , director of the @entity15			0
' @entity51 was rescued at a very young age so she has really taken to her carers and loves to suck their fingers for comfort			0

terribly injured , the female elephant had to be put to sleep , while her calf was taken to the orphanage			0
‘ sadly , @entity171 ’s elephants are under threat from poachers for their ivory , ' adds @entity148			0
nevertheless , when he is old enough , @entity131 and his best friend @entity169 , will be re-homed in @entity175			0
for now though , his days , much like those of a human child , are a whirlwind of play , cuddles and bottle feeds			0
