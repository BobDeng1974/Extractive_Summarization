it did n’t take long for us to get used to googling things , instead of looking them up in books			1
but the process of typing words into a search box could be replaced by using the cameras on our smartphones to find the information we ’re looking for			2
@entity11 , the world ’s largest image recognition and augmented reality platform , has re-launched its app to change the way we search for things and interact with the world around us			1
users can ' blipp objects , such as @entity25 and adverts to access information about them online and could soon blipp any object , such as apples ( shown ) users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to ‘ look ’ at any object and use the image to search for it online in the long - term			1
but to begin with , they will be able to use it on @entity41 album covers , fiction books , dvd covers and movie posters			2
when a user ‘ blipps ’ one of these items or images , they will be presented with a range of information about it			1
for example , if they blipp an album cover , they may be presented with access to videos of the band , a source to buy tickets to an upcoming concert , details on what people are saying about them on @entity58 or photos of the band itself			1
users have to launch the app on their phone			2
the new version will be out in april			0
they will see a view using the phone 's camera , which will show any products that are ' blippable '			0
when an object is detected , users will see augmented reality content , which could take the form of a video , reviews or related information			1
the first blippable objects on the new app will be cds , dvds and film posters , but more will be added			1
however , the app ’s plans are more ambitious			0
@entity11 aims to make the entire physical world visually searchable via mobile devices and wearables			0
in the future , it aims to make everything blippable , from an apple or chocolate bar , to a dog on the street or even the @entity102			0
web - based search as it exists today has dominated the digital experience , both online and mobile			0
from inputting keywords to digging through pages of links to access information , this search behaviour is limited by vocabulary and literacy			1
@entity11 ’s image recognition service aims to go beyond language to allow consumers to pull timely , relevant information directly from the environment around them			1
‘ the human imagination , curiosity and the quest for knowledge are all often limited by our capacity to define and assign language to describe and seek answers from the world around us ’ said @entity118 and ceo @entity119			0
users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to ‘ look ’ at any object and use the image to search for it , and related information online			1
the @entity137 and @entity138 - based company has already rolled out inority report - style advertising			0
a still from the film is shown ‘ today marks the beginning of a new era of search , where curious users will be able to visually search the world through the lens of the @entity149 app. ‘ the technology holds massive potential for enriching real world experiences and delivering genuine value to our users			2
‘ the visual search is not replacing text - based search , it ’s an alternate behaviour which satisfies people ’s spontaneous needs of instant object focused curiosity , therefore introducing the light web			2
’ the company claims that @entity11 ’s platform allows users to access information faster than using traditional online search methods			1
it will also use artificial intelligence to refine and personalise the visual search results for each user			0
the updated app will be available to download for @entity174 and @entity175 in april 2015			0
last year , @entity11 unveiled the first image recognition and tracking app for @entity179 wearers that shows videos , webpages , and more , simply by looking at a picture			1
it was the first time the technology could be used automatically , and seamlessly , just by looking at an advert			0
' @entity11 has already worked with thousands of the world ’s largest brands and publishers to create engaging branded experiences that are triggered by objects , magazine pages , advertisements and more , “ blipped ” by millions of users around the world , ' mr @entity119 said			2
there are many visual search apps competing to win users from @entity198			0
@entity200 , for example , lets users take a photo of an item of clothing and finds others in exactly the same colour , which they can then buy at the click of a button .			0

@entity11 app will be refreshed in april to allow users to use their smartphone cameras to access information online
the long - term plan is that users will be able to use the camera on their smartphone to ‘ look ’ at any object , from apples to the @entity102
at launch , they will be able to ' blipp ' cds , books , dvds and film posters
the service will give them access to videos , information and reviews
