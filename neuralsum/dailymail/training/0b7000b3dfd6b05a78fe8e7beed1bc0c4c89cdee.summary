by @entity0 politicians in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 are considering banning the burka in public after the @entity7 upheld @entity9 laws politicians in @entity2 are set to introduce a motion to ban burkas after the @entity7 upheld @entity9 rules barring people from covering their face in public			1
members of @entity2 's @entity17 could put the motion before parliament as early as next week , while mps from the @entity21 and @entity4 's @entity22 and progress parties are considering similar plans			1
on tuesday the @entity7 ruled that a @entity9 ban on wearing full - face veils in public did not breach human rights as it did n't specifically target @entity29			1
members of @entity2 's @entity17 added that there was no compulsion in @entity32 to wear a full - face veil , and so any ban would not constitute an attack on religious freedoms			1
@entity17 spokeswoman @entity37 told @entity38 that in the ' wide , conservative circles of @entity32 immigration society ' , the opinion prevails that women are second - class citizens			2
one of the many instruments for oppressing women is the burka , she added			0
in @entity3 a ban was last discussed between 2009 and 2010 but was quickly shot down in the belief that the @entity7 would rule against it			1
but now @entity47 , a member of the anti-immigration @entity21 , says the legal framework for a ban has been laid down			2
he told @entity51 : ' [ a ban ] would send the signal that we do not accept parallel societies and isolation			0
we see [ the burka ] as a rejection of @entity3 society			0
' it is a sign that one wishes to distance themselves from the rest of society			0
' meanwhile the @entity22 parties in @entity4 welcomed the ban , and suggested they may also raise the issue again			2
former @entity67 leader @entity66 said the judgement was positive , and recognised that hiding behind a veil meant other members of your community struggled to relate to you			0
on tuesday judges at the @entity7 ( pictured ) ruled that a @entity9 ban on full - face veils in public did n't breach human rights as it was n't targeted specifically at @entity29 and posed a barrier to social cohesion a law banning full - face veils was rejected by the country 's parliament just last year over concerns the @entity7 would reject it			1
but despite the new ruling , politicians in @entity4 admit that any new proposition is unlikely to pass as public opinion seems to be against such a law			2
@entity9 's parliament passed a burka ban in 2010 , leading to protests from @entity32 groups who said it was discriminatory			1
however on tuesday judges said that the measure aimed at stopping women covering their faces in public was entirely justified			0
they said that the right of ordinary people to ' live together ' was a ' legitimate objective ' , and that @entity29 women wearing face coverings threatened it			0
@entity107 and parts of @entity109 have also introduced bans , and similar ones are being considered in @entity112 and @entity113			1
plans for one in @entity115 have also been mooted by backbench mps and other politicians , including members of the @entity115 @entity119 .			0

@entity7 ruled @entity9 ban on full - face veils legal
now politicians in @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 could follow suit
@entity2 's @entity17 could put motion before parliament next week
@entity3 's @entity21 say ban *needed* to stop women being oppressed
@entity107 and parts of @entity109 already have veil bans in place
