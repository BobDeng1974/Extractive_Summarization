a mother and daughter have spoken of their experience of both being diagnosed with the same cancer at exactly the same age			1
@entity6 , 55 , from @entity7 in @entity8 , was diagnosed with the blood cancer @entity10 ’s lymphoma at the age of 24 in 1982			1
she beat the condition and , despite being told she may not be able to have children , gave birth to daughter @entity16 in 1988			1
astonishingly , @entity17 was diagnosed with the same condition in 2011 , despite the cancer not being considered to have a strong hereditary link			1
@entity6 and her daughter @entity17 were both diagnosed with @entity10 's lymphoma aged 24 - despite the fact the cancer is not thought to have a genetic link ‘ i could n’t believe that @entity17 could have the same disease as me at exactly the same age - especially as family history is n’t thought to play a role , ’ said @entity6 indeed although there can be a slightly increased risk of developing the cancer if a close relative has suffered with the condition , it is not known whether genes or a shared lifestyle play the deciding role			1
' it 's an amazing story because the the risk of two relatives getting the cancer is very low , ' said @entity41 , head information nurse at @entity42			2
@entity6 said she knew that something was wrong when she developed a lump on the side of her neck as a young woman			1
‘ almost overnight , a lump appeared - but i thought it was nothing , so i left it for a couple of weeks			2
but it did n’t disappear and it was totally painless which is a key symptoms of @entity10 ’s			1
’ @entity51 eventually saw a doctor who sent her for blood tests			0
they showed an abnormality and a biopsy confirmed that she had cancer but that it was only in the early stages – between stage two and three			1
survivors : the mother daughter duo said they were n't frightened about their diagnoses and tried to remain positive throughout their cancer treatment @entity17 , now 25 , said that having a mother who had been through the same ordeal was reassuring			1
@entity16 's cancer was more advanced than her mother 's when diagnosed and she underwent both chemotherapy and radiotherapy because the cancer was contained , she underwent four weeks of targeted radiotherapy			1
‘ it was tough – i felt nauseous constantly and of course the insides of my mouths were raw from radiation burns , ’ she said			0
but @entity6 said she was n’t scared about the diagnosis because in the @entity81 , people were far less aware of the gravity of cance , she says			1
‘ back then you just had to get on with it – there was less support			0
to tell you the truth , i needed it explained to me that lymphoma was a cancer of the blood because it just was n’t publicised then			2
‘ i ’m an optimistic person , too , and i just did n’t think to get too down about it			0
’ @entity6 was later given the all clear and has enjoyed good health ever since			1
@entity6 admitted that in 2011 she had n’t given much thought to her cancer in many years so when daughter @entity16 started to exhibit certain symptoms , she did n't think it could be the same cancer she had suffered with three decades before			1
@entity10 ( cells pictured ) is a disease of the white blood cells and make sufferers more prone to infection ' my lump was smaller than @entity108 's and did n't grow anywhere near as fast , no none of us thought it could be the beginnings of the same disease , ' said @entity17			1
eventually the symptoms worsened and @entity16 began to lose weight , suffered night sweats , abdominal pain - which doctors later discovered was caused by an enlarged spleen			1
doctors sent her for an ultrasound scan but because they did n't think it was urgent , she did n't receive the results for a month			2
by the time the scan came back in august she had developed another lump under her arm			2
@entity17 was given an immediate biopsy she was given the news that was suffering with @entity10 's lymphoma within 24 hours			1
' it was bizarre being given the same news but i did n't panic , ' said @entity17			1
' there were a couple of tears but it was so good to know i was n't alone because @entity108 had been through the same			0
' ' you do n't want to burden your friends with your worries about cancer , so knowing i had @entity108 who had been through it all before made it feel like i could confide in her			2
' @entity17 's lymphoma was more advanced than her mother 's and she was diagnosed with stage three to four cancer			1
she was treated at @entity143 in @entity144 and was given radiotherapy and underwent six cycles of chemotherapy			0
@entity16 went into remission in january 2012 and was given the all - clear the following month			0
she is now feeling ' better than ever ' and is enjoying her new job as a charity fundraiser for @entity151 and @entity152			0
@entity16 and @entity6 are supporting @entity42 's @entity153 2013			1
@entity154 , walk or sponsor			0
enter now at @entity157 nearly 1,500 people are diagnosed with @entity10 ( @entity159 ) in the @entity160 each year			2
@entity159 is cancer of the white blood cells called b lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system , which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body			0
the lymphatic system is part of your immune system			0
@entity174 fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection - fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes			0
lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system , such as the lymph nodes or glands			0
these lymphocytes lose their infection - fighting properties , making you more vulnerable to infection			0
the most common symptom of @entity159 is a painless swelling in a lymph node , usually in the neck , armpit or groin			0
it usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50			2
the cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system , taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the @entity206 ( which causes glandular fever )			0
it is n’t thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it			2
the only way to confirm a diagnosis of @entity159 is by carrying out a biopsy			0
almost all young people with @entity159 will be fully cured			0
for older people over the age of 50 , the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent			0
treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy , chemotherapy and drugs including steroids .			0

@entity6 , now 55 , developed @entity10 aged 24
she beat the disease and went on to have daughter @entity17 in 1988
in 2011 , @entity17 showed *unusual* symptoms and doctors confirmed she had not only developed same disease , but at same age as her mother
it is not thought to be a cancer that is passed down through families
