@entity1 host @entity0 caused an uproar during tuesday night 's episode of the game show when he posed a controversial question about cyclists			1
as the question ' what is something annoying that cyclists might do ? ' flashed up on the screen , the cycling community went into meltdown on social media , deeming it ' disgusting ' and swearing off the show forever			1
the premise of the show is to pick the most common answers as decided by a survey , as two families battle it out for the most points			2
' run red light ' , ' pull out in front ' , ' ride slowly ' and ' @entity37 ' also made it into the top answers much to the dismay of cyclists on social media			1
' wear lycra ' was the last answer to round out the top eight - a hot topic in the media in recent weeks after a pub banned men wearing lycra from entering their premises			0
social media was alight with heated discussion following the airing of the @entity1 episode , with @entity55 writing on @entity56 that he was n't normally a viewer but now will actively avoid the show			1
the top answer was ' taking the driving lane ' with ' wearing lycra ' also appearing on the list facebook users were very unimpressed with the question , taking to the family feud page to complain @entity66 tweeted that the @entity68 program was ' bloody pathetic ' ' do n't normally watch this show , but turned on to hear " something annoying cyclists do " , ' he wrote			1
as someone who was recently physically assaulted for nothing more than riding a bike , i 'd like to know why @entity1 and @entity68 are encouraging that sort of stupidity towards cyclists ...			2
the fact the answer " everything " was even allowed as an answer is disgusting ! ' mr @entity55 continued			0
meantime @entity84 said the family game show had just lost a long - term fan			0
' so disgusted by the cyclist question - im not watching anymore and i really liked the show			0
' @entity89 posted that the move was ' absolutely disgusting ' and asked who approved the segment @entity93 pointed out that many children ride bicycles too ' a purportedly family friendly tv show promoting hate and ill - will towards vulnerable road users			0
absolutely disgraceful ' , @entity99 wrote , demanding a ' formal written and on - air apology '			0
@entity101 was equally unimpressed with the show 's question , with @ @entity104 tweeting about the episode			2
@entity89 posted that the move was ' absolutely disgusting ' and asked who approved the segment , while @entity66 called it ' bloody pathetic '			0
@entity1 was in hot water and called ' sexist ' when they asked an outdated question about jobs for women which included answers such as ' cooking ' and ' cleaning ' .			1

the question caused social media chaos on tuesday night
cyclists took to @entity101 and @entity56 to slam @entity1
many swore they would no longer watch the show and called it ' disgusting '
some answers to the question included ' cut you off ' and ' everything '
