by @entity0 last updated at 10:27 am on 25th october 2011 passenger planes of the future could be able to take people directly to their front door , a report suggests today			1
commercial jets could also be made that fly five times the speed of sound - meaning they could fly from @entity10 to @entity11 in less than an hour			1
such aircraft could come into construction by the end of the century and would be part of efforts to place the @entity19 at the forefront of future aerospace innovation , a report by the @entity13 says			2
the passenger drop - off idea would use what has been called ' a sort of @entity25 for the skies '			2
scramjet planes like this one designed by @entity28 are among the speediest of aircraft looking towards 2075 and beyond , the report talked of advances that could be made in aircraft design			0
it talks of passenger scramjet planes able to fly at around 4,000mph - five times the speed of sound - and commercial aircraft flying in a v - shaped formation that could to save power by making use of airflow generated by the plane in front , similar to the way migrating birds support one another in the air			1
scramjets - short for supersonic combustion ramjet - contain a ' air - breathing ' jet engine , that allows them to combust fuel and decelerate the incoming air to produce speed and thrust			2
the fastest current ' air - breathing aircraft ' is a scramjet designed by @entity28 , which reached a velocity of @entity61 - or 7,000mph			2
so far , though , these hi - tech aircraft are unable to carry passengers			1
@entity28 's record - breaking @entity65 aircraft looks more like a missile than a plane			0
passenger jets would necessarily be a little hair - raising - and travel at a more ' moderate ' speed of 4,000mph			0
@entity11 to @entity72 hours down to 2.5 hours @entity10 to @entity73 hours down to 55 minutes @entity10 to @entity74 hours down to 1hr 40mins @entity28 's hypersonic jets are designed to fly through the @entity77 ’s atmosphere and slash flight times around the world to a few hours at most			1
travelling at such speed would reduce the flight time from @entity11 to @entity82 to around two - and - a - half hours , from the 21 hours it is now			1
the report also discusses looking at ways to create an ' aircraft carrier ' system in which a large aircraft carries individual units that can be released over a destination to float down to the designated area where a passenger needs to go - as if dropping passengers ' at their door '			1
other ideas are a ' flying wing ' design , where the plane 's main body , wings and engine blended together and a ' flying fuel station ' so future planes do not have to take off with full tanks			0
a graphic of the airflow over a @entity28 scramjet scramjet engine ' combusts ' fuel and decelerates the incoming air to produce speed and thrust @entity13 chief executive , @entity113 chief executive of @entity114 said that even in the next 20 years , there were potential sales of 25,000 new aircraft set to be worth more than £ 2,000billion			0
he said : ' now is the time for industry and government to focus on sectors that can help lift the country 's economy			0
' the @entity19 aerospace sector already employs over 100,000 people around the country and is worth over £ 29 billion a year to our economy , but we need to take action now to ensure this sector can continue to thrive and grow			0
' there is great potential for new @entity19 aerospace technologies , but in order to compete with emerging nations , we need to set up a strategic vision for @entity19 aerospace , establish a new dedicated aerospace research body and restore research and development funding to pre-recession levels			0

commercial aircraft of the future could drop passengers off at the door
4,000mph ' scramjets ' could carry people from @entity10 - @entity11 in under an hour
