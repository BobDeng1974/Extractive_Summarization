the land mass of the @entity3 is so vast , the whole of the @entity1 could fit inside it more than 40 times over			1
while @entity8 , with the largest land mass of any country , is 8.5 million times bigger than one of the smallest , @entity10			1
these figures are taken from the global comparison site @entity13 which aims to show people how their lives would be different if they moved to another country			1
its @entity24 tool compares the land mass of countries , and shows how the two nations would appear if they were laid over the top of one another			1
for example , the @entity1 is approximately 40 times smaller than the @entity3 , and would fit inside @entity31 and @entity32 @entity18 collects statistical data points taken from the @entity20 , @entity21 and other public sources , and uses this data to offer up interesting comparisons between countries			1
it has three tools called @entity24 , @entity38 and @entity39			0
the first compares the land mass of different countries , and shows how the two nations would appear if they were laid over the top of one another			1
for example , the @entity1 covers approximately 94 , 058 square miles ( 243,610 square km ) , while the @entity3 is approximately 3,794,100 square miles ( 9,826,675 square km )			1
this means the majority of @entity1 could fit inside the @entity31 and @entity32			2
at the other end of the scale , @entity8 covers 8,549,121 million times more land than @entity10			1
the countries measure 6,601,668 square miles ( 17,098,242 square km ) and 0.07 square miles ( 2 square km ) respectively			0
in fact , @entity10 is so small , that when placed over a map of @entity8 ( pictured left ) it almost disappears as the map zooms outs ( pictured right as a small black dot ) meanwhile , the @entity3 and @entity54 are much closer in size ( pictured )			1
@entity54 is approximately 2,988,901 square miles ( 7,741,220 square km ) , compared to the size of the @entity3 , which measures approximately 3,794,100 square miles ( 9,826,675 square km ) at the other end of the scale , @entity8 covers 8,549,121 million times more land than @entity10 - measuring 6,601,668 square miles ( 17,098,242 square km ) and 0.07 square miles ( 2 square km ) respectively			1
@entity10 is so small , when placed over a map of @entity8 , that zooming out too far makes it disappear			1
meanwhile , the @entity3 and @entity54 are much closer in size			2
the @entity18 tool also compares the economy and life expectancy of different countries			1
for example , people in the @entity3 make 41.6 % more than in the @entity1 , but are three times more likely to have @entity68 , 39 per cent more likely to die in infancy , and have 9.8 per cent more babies the etiquette tool also helps visitors to other countries learn about local customs			1
for @entity76 , the tool explains that a standard greeting at dinner is cheers			0
table manners in the @entity3 are informal , but people should refrain from putting their elbows on the table			1
at a bar , drinks cost around $ 1 to $ 3 , and restaurants usually expect a tip of around 15 to 20 per cent @entity54 is approximately 2,988,901 square miles ( 7,741,220 square km ) , compared to the @entity3 ' 3,794,100 square miles ( 9,826,675 square km )			2
but in @entity89 , @entity88 means cheers			0
diners should also keep their bowl close to their mouth when eating soup , and should never get drunk while dining			0
the @entity18 tool also compares the economy and life expectancy of different countries to each other			1
for example , people in the @entity3 make 41.6 % more than @entity1 residents , but are three times more likely to have @entity68 , 39 per cent more likely to die in infancy , and have 9.8 per cent more babies			1
the etiquette tool also helps visitors to other countries learn about local customs , greeting and how much drinks should cost			2
for @entity76 , the tool explains that a standard greeting at dinner is cheers			0
table manners in the @entity3 are informal , but people should refrain from putting their elbows on the table			1
at a bar , drinks cost around $ 1 to $ 3 , and restaurants usually expect a tip of around 15 to 20 per cent			0
the tool also advises against displaying a middle finger by itself , and invading the personal space of others			0
but in @entity89 , @entity88 means cheers			0
diners should also keep their bowl close to their mouth when eating soup , and should never get drunk while dining			0
tipping can sometimes be considered an insult in @entity89 , and people should n't pour soy sauce over steamed rice , use chopsticks to point at something , and show always bow when greeting a new person			0

' @entity160 - based company @entity159 has revealed the countries best - equipped to cope with climate change on a map ( shown )			2
@entity165 countries like @entity166 and @entity167 , and also the @entity1 , score highly			2
@entity168 is best , scaling down to red being worst climate change experts have released a map of the world revealing how prepared different countries are to cope with the effects of climate change ( shown above )			2
in the map 192 countries are ranked by their ‘ vulnerability ’ and ‘ readiness ’ , producing an overall score on their fate , ranging from bad ( zero ) to excellent ( 100 )			2
the results reveal that @entity165 countries and the @entity1 are among the most likely to survive - but areas of @entity185 will be hardest hit			2
the maps were created by @entity160 - based company @entity159 , using data from the @entity189 in @entity190 , known as the @entity191			0
they took into account location , terrain , pollution rates and national resources when calculating which countries would be most affected			0
countries like @entity166 , @entity199 , @entity167 and @entity200 score well on the scale			0
but places like @entity76 , @entity185 and @entity203 all appear at risk from natural disaster - and are poorly equipped to cope , said @entity159			0
@entity206 , of @entity159 warned : ‘ @entity207 , earthquakes , blizzards , droughts and flooding are all real dangers for some of these areas , and this is compounded by a lack of national strategy to counteract the effects			0
’ @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and the @entity222 produced some of the lowest scores , meaning these countries will be the biggest victims of weather disasters .			0

the comparisons are made on an *interactive* map created by *developers* at @entity232
@entity13 compares statistical data taken from the @entity20 , @entity21 and other public sources
it reveals that the @entity3 is 40 times larger , in terms of land mass , than the @entity1
while @entity8 , with the largest land mass of any country , is 8.5 million times bigger than one of the smallest , @entity10
the @entity18 tool also compares the economy and life expectancy of different countries to each other
for example , people in the @entity3 make 41.6 % more than @entity1 residents , but are three times more likely to have @entity68
