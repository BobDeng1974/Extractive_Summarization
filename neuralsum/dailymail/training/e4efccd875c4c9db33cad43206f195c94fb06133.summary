by @entity0 @entity2 's share price today hit an all time low of $ 19.82 which values the social networking giant at almost half its may initial offering price of $ 38			1
the companyâ € ™ s stock dropped 88 cents on thursday , dropping to its new low after the company posted disappointing earnings last week			2
it also directly followed the revelation today there are now more than 83 million fake users on its social network			1
are your @entity2 friends real ? @entity20 's site has been found to contain over 83 million fake profiles the astonishing figure makes up 8.7 % of all @entity2 's 995 million active users			1
the true scale of the problem was hidden in a company filing published this week , the first since the firm went public			0
duplicate profiles made up 4.8 % of the fakes , user - misclassified accounts amounted to 2.4 % , and 1.5 % of users were described as ' undesirable '			2
there were 83.09 million fake users in total , which @entity2 classified in three groups			1
the largest group were duplicate accounts , such as those set up by people to keep their activities from their partner			0

there were also a large number of ' undesirable ' accounts were profiles deemed to be in breach of @entity2 's terms of service			1
these accounts were believed to have been set up to send out junk email messages			0
the reason for the drop is due to the fact that @entity81 € ™ s first tier of restrictions go away on august 16 , when about 271 million shares will be available for trading , with another 243 million shares set to become available for trading between mid-october and mid-november			0
but the day most investors are bracing for is nov. 14 , when more than 1.2 billion shares will suddenly be available for trading			0
the imminent lock - up expiration also means that @entity91 analysts who participated in the @entity92 will once again go quiet , for a 30 - day period , potentially creating more uncertainty in a stock that has experienced one of the rockiest market debuts in memory			0
' the sentiment on this thing is so negative , ' said @entity101 analyst @entity100			0
' i think this thing may continue to tick down until you see some sort of meaningful catalyst which unfortunately may not show until third - quarter earnings			0
