@entity0 will look to sell @entity1 but the chances of him leaving in january are small			1
the @entity5 forward has failed to deliver on the pitch and @entity0 can ill afford any passengers at the moment having scored just seven league goals at @entity10 this season			2
however , the injury to @entity13 and the likelihood that @entity15 will stay at @entity16 , at this stage , means @entity1 will likely see out the season			0
@entity28 's @entity19 has been offered to them , while @entity30 's prolific @entity29 and @entity32 's @entity31 have been watched			1
the goalkeeper situation is still pressing for manager @entity34 and they have watched @entity37 's @entity36 , a 21 - year - old 6ft 4in @entity38 under 21 keeper , a couple of times but ideally need an experienced man to replace current no 1 @entity43			0
@entity32 's @entity31 has been watched by @entity0 as a possible purchase in january @entity30 's prolific striker @entity29 could be the answer to @entity0 's problems in the next transfer slot @entity28 's @entity19 has been offered to @entity0 for when the january transfer window opens @entity30 are monitoring @entity51 defender @entity50 as they prepare to lose @entity52			1

a former target for @entity61 and @entity73 , @entity50 is well regarded around @entity74			0
he is a product of the @entity76 in @entity77 which also helped develop @entity78 and previously played for @entity79			0
@entity80 , @entity0 and @entity81 have also watched him in recent seasons			2
@entity30 are bracing themselves for offers for @entity52 who has attracted interest from @entity61 @entity86 are showing an interest in @entity89 striker @entity88			1
the 26 - year - old @entity90 forward has scored seven goals this season , including the winner against @entity94 on saturday			0

he had subsequent spells at @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114 but failed to make an impact			2

@entity89 may listen to bids around £ 2m			0
@entity62 are following @entity123 midfielder @entity122			1

@entity62 are following @entity123 midfielder @entity122 with the january transfer window coming up @entity122 , who has scored five goals this season , plays as an attacking midfielder and sometimes as a secondary striker but he can also play deeper and has an eye for a pass			1
@entity123 only signed him last summer on a free after he allowed his contract to run down at previous club @entity146			0
the @entity132 value @entity122 in the £ 7m bracket but @entity62 would be looking to pay around £ 3.5m if they press ahead			2

@entity155 has a £ 7m release clause but would prefer a move to a bigger club should he leave @entity156 while @entity157 is leaning towards signing a new deal at @entity112			1
@entity158 is a player several @entity21 sides are considering but he wo n't come cheap with @entity159 holding out for at least the same £ 11m fee @entity166 gained from @entity167 for @entity168			2
that is likely to deter @entity114			0
