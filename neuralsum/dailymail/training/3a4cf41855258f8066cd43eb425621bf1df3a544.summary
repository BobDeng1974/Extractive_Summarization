by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:15 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 07:12 est , 23 september 2013 @entity3 tried to gain access to @entity6 's records to copy how to be the perfect prime minister 's wife , it has emerged			1
former @entity10 spin doctor @entity9 said @entity12 's wife wanted to use mrs @entity6 's emails , diary and contacts when setting up her private office			1
but the request was refused , and @entity20 's wife 's strategy for handling her public profile remained secret			2
@entity3 ( left ) has modeled herself on the deeply intelligent , private @entity6 ( right ) mr @entity9 writes in his explosive memoir @entity22 about his admiration for @entity24 , and the way she stood by @entity20 when the pressure of being prime minister mounted			1
' over the years , i came to realise that @entity6 was a deeply intelligent , private person with a ferocious passion for causes and people close to her heart , ' he said			2
' to her , @entity20 was always the star and , whatever she did to support him , it was always to enhance the story of the day — not become the story herself			0
' mr @entity9 went on : ' when she was sworn at by the pr supremo @entity41 for failing to deliver @entity20 for a photo - stunt with @entity43 and @entity44 at @entity45 , she just shrugged — because what really mattered to her was what was best for @entity20 and her boys			2
' it was little wonder that when the @entity54 came into @entity10 , they asked for access to her emails , diary and contacts book to study ‘ best practice ’ for setting up @entity3 ’s private office			1
' they were refused permission			0
@entity6 , however , will always be a tough act to follow , because — like @entity66 — with her , it was never an act			0
' class act : @entity9 paid tribute to @entity6 's quiet loyalty to husband @entity20 he has also contrasted mrs @entity6 's private loyalty to her husband to @entity74 's love of the limelight during the long feud between mr @entity20 and @entity43			1
recalling an incident at a party conference when just as mr @entity20 was saying in a speech how great mr @entity43 was , mrs @entity74 shouted back : ‘ well , that ’s a bloody lie			0
’ mr @entity9 added : ' you could argue , of course , that @entity83 was only showing loyalty to her husband			0
' but unlike @entity6 — who was no less fiercely loyal to @entity20 — @entity83 was never happy unless her loyalty was expressed publicly , with her face all over the papers			0

@entity3 requested access to diary and emails for ' best practice '
but @entity6 refused , according to @entity9 's memoirs
