by @entity0 published : 06:27 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 09:03 est , 8 october 2013 retired : @entity1 has quit as headteacher of @entity3 in @entity4 a primary school headteacher has quit months after she was suspended for sending pupils to a tiny box room dubbed ' the naughty cupboard '			1
@entity1 , 62 , stood down from her job at @entity3 in @entity4 seven months after she and six colleagues were the subject of a police investigation			1
staff were suspended and sent home following allegations children were ordered to sit in the small isolation room as punishment for being disruptive in class			1
a police inquiry was launched after one boy was sent to the room at the @entity24 school when he falsely claimed he had a knife and threatened to stab himself and others			1
officers dropped the case after 10 days but seven months on , @entity4 council are still continuing their investigation into the incident			2
they said there were concerns over the ' professional judgement ' of staff when isolating pupils for challenging behaviour - but confirmed there was no reason to suspect any child had come to any harm			1
mrs @entity1 - who was not in work on the day of the incident - today revealed she has retired from her role			1
she has claimed education chiefs previously ignored her pleas for help in dealing with unruly children			1
she said : ' several emails were sent to the authority seeking support and advice but they were ignored			2
we always asked for help and ideas			2
' i never received a response to my communications			0
the school improvement officer never indicated they had any concerns with safeguarding in the school			0
so this investigation came as a real shock			0
' @entity4 council launched their investigation into the use of what parents called the ' naughty cupboard ' following the february half - term , after receiving a tip - off			0
defending the use of the ' time out room ' , mrs @entity1 told her local newspaper : ' it was considered to be a time out room			1
it was for extreme behaviour and for children to cool down on their own			1
' often a child wanted to have a sleep			0
when anybody gets so worked up , they get tired			0
' we had a large room and a small one and children were given the choice of which they wanted to go in			1
' the lock was only installed as a temporary measure because the door had been badly damaged just a few weeks prior to the incident			0
it was to stop children from getting into the room , ' she added			1
' i did not envisage a lock on a damaged door for health and safety reasons could negatively affect the welfare of children and result in the unpleasant repercussions of the incident			2
' the door would have been replaced in the new financial year and the replacement would not have had a lock on it			0
' mrs @entity1 resigned in august after 32 years in the profession , the last six at @entity3			1
she claims she had already handed in her notice before she was suspended			1
she added : ' you hope that nothing will happen when you ’re off and when it does and you ’re suspended as a result and ultimately potentially blamed and it ’s your name given out , it ’s disappointing to say the least			2
' a lot of public money has been spent on an investigation - something the police sorted out in 10 days and is taking the authority more than six months to sort out			0
' my biggest disappointment was i retired still under suspension , that was never lifted			0
' i ’m disappointed i did n’t get to see the children again because the one thing my career was all about was the children			2
it ’s just sad to finish your career in that way			0
' i do n’t hold anything against anybody personally but i would have liked some closure , with the authority to acknowledge that i ’d retired			0
' i had always intended to hand in my resignation when i returned to work following the february half term break , it is simply coincidence that my resignation was handed in around the time of the suspension			2
' it is understood some of the suspended staff will be returning to their posts , pending the outcome of individual disciplinary hearings			1
the school is now in the process of recruiting a new headteacher			0
@entity167 said : ' we can confirm @entity1 has resigned from her post of headteacher at @entity171 with effect from august 31 , 2013			1
' as the disciplinary process is still ongoing with several members of staff it would be inappropriate to comment on the statements made by @entity178 in relation to the incident in february			1
' the march 2013 @entity182 inspection , that deemed the school to be in special measures , identified the leadership to be inadequate			0
' an inspection that took place in july states the interim leadership team have already had " an immediate and positive impact " which should give parents and pupils confidence that the school is now improving and moving forward			0
' @entity194 , @entity4 branch secretary for the @entity195 , said : ' i just find it very , very sad that it ’s all happened			0
they were doing a good job , it was a very challenging school and staff were very highly qualified			2
' hopefully when the investigation comes to an end the school can draw a line under it			0
