@entity1 , 28 , was walking along @entity14 , off @entity15 , in @entity16 - in @entity3 's south - when he was ambushed by two men while he was wearing an @entity7 @entity20 shirt from his two - year stint in the service in what he is calling an ' anti-semitic ' attack			1
at the time , the dual citizen was walking to his girlfriend 's place when he noticed two men following him			1
' the side street was very dark and apparently empty of people , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' when i got about halfway down the street , i suddenly noticed that there were two people right behind me			2
' i got a shock as i had not noticed them until then which i found odd			0
' at that moment they both jumped on me and started punching and shouting in @entity41 " , " @entity42 " [ @entity38 is great ] and something i did n’t understand about @entity40			2
' it completely came out of nowhere			0
' luckily , mr @entity1 was able to fight off his attackers , return to his girlfriend 's house and report the incident to @entity49 police station			1
' initially i just attempted to shield myself from their blows , and then one of them grabbed me from my left side as if he was trying to drag me somewhere , ' he said			0
' at that point , i realised it was very serious and started fighting back			0
' i threw punches at both of them and managed to grab one of them by the throat which i proceeded to squeeze as hard as i could			0
he was attacked on @entity64 in @entity16 - in @entity3 's south mr @entity1 did not notice a weapon at the time , but police say this slash was most likely caused by a screwdriver ' i pointed at the other man with my free hand and yelled @entity5 curses at them as aggressively as possible			1
' this startled them quite a bit and when i pushed the one whose neck i was holding away , they fled towards @entity15			0
' when he got to his girlfriend 's house , she noticed mr @entity1 was covered in scratches , his t - shirt sliced open around the belly and his face was swollen			1
' i did not notice a weapon at the time but the police later suggested that they might have had a screwdriver or something similar , ' he said			2
mr @entity1 was attacked while walking to his girlfriend 's house mr @entity1 thinks an @entity95 t - shirt ( left ) he was wearing sparked the attack which left him with scratches ( right ) mr @entity1 described his attackers as between the ages of 18 to 20 , slim and of @entity101 appearance			1
he believes the t - shirt he was wearing at the time of the attack sparked the ambush			0
' it has a scorpion on it and in @entity108 it says " stinger " , which is the airforce special forces i was part of , and in @entity114 it says the word march as in the month and ’ 08 - the year that my training took place , ' mr @entity1 said			1
' there are some comments on the @entity121 saying that i provoked the attack by wearing the shirt , but i do n’t think anyone deserves to be attacked like that they no matter what their wearing			2
' there ’s no way anyone would have identified the shirt unless they knew @entity114			0
' clearly it was an anti-semitic attack			0
' i just think everybody has the right to be safe on the street and if you have a political protest or something do it civilly and within the law			2
