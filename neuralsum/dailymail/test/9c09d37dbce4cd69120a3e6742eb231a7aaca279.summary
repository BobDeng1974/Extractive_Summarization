the @entity0 of @entity1 and @entity2 wants dog owners to pick up their pets ' droppings and use bins provided a @entity8 council is to introduce csi - style dna testing for dogs so it can track and fine owners who do n't clean up after their animals			1
the @entity0 of @entity1 and @entity2 wants dog owners to submit a dna sample from the inside of the animal 's cheek so it is registered on a database			1
the council would then use stored information to match the animal responsible with any errant mess found on the streets - and issue the owner an £ 80 fine			1
the laboratory testing is believed to be 99.9 per cent accurate			0
the council hopes that the collection of dna samples would fit well with new national laws requiring all owners in @entity32 to microchip their dogs by april next year			2
and while it will mean an expense for the council , they believe it will represent value for money for residents as similar schemes in the @entity43 have reduced dog fouling by up to 90 per cent			1
the move is part of efforts from the council to reduce its £ 2.3million annual street cleansing bill			0
although the methods may seem extreme , @entity51 leader councillor @entity50 claims they are necessary to clean up the borough			0
he said : ' we are the first council in the country to get really tough on dog mess and pet owners who do not act in a socially responsible way			2
' the vast majority of dog owners in @entity1 and @entity2 are socially responsible but unfortunately a selfish few think it 's ok to not clean up after their pet			2
' @entity65 mess not only spoils our streets – it 's also a health hazard and especially to young children which is why we are using this innovative approach			0
' the scheme is currently being discussed under the tagline leading a @entity73 - but there are no plans as yet to make it mandatory			0
the @entity0 of @entity1 and @entity2 , @entity77 pictured , will become the first in the @entity32 to introduce the plans which will allow them to match dog mess to owners and issue fines they 're currently in discussion with stakeholders including the @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 , the company which will run the dna testing , on how owners can be encouraged to submit the samples			1
@entity94 managing director @entity93 said : ' i believe the combination of dna testing and enforcement could be the most effective means of ensuring owners are held accountable for their dog 's actions			2
' in the @entity43 , we have experienced reductions in dog fouling by as much as 90 per cent after introducing the programme			1
' for the vast majority of responsible dog owners this should pose no problem at all			0
' in fact , we believe that the minimal cost involved in the dna testing will pose value for money when the selfish minority of dog owners are brought to task			0

@entity1 and @entity2 to become first council to dna test dog mess
@entity51 could match @entity121 with sample from mess and fine owners £ 80
wants to ' encourage ' swab registration - which would not be mandatory
schemes in the @entity43 have reduced dog fouling as much as 90 per cent
