@entity9 's parents , @entity33 and @entity34 , have said they want to establish the sequence of events that led to his death so no other family will suffer a similar tragedy			1
they hope the trial will provide answers to lingering questions surrounding their son 's death			0
mr @entity9 , 50 , an @entity45 manager from @entity46 , @entity47 , said : ' all this time after @entity9 's death we are still not sure of exactly what happened			1
' not knowing the events which led to his death is something which holds back the healing process			0
' we have some information about what went so dreadfully wrong but not all the details			0
we have a jigsaw but with some of the pieces missing			0
' we 're hoping that through the trial in @entity18 we will soon get those questions answered			0
' lawyers representing @entity23 a @entity24 confirmed the firm and @entity63 will face trial this year			1
@entity9 ( pictured ) was one of the brightest maths prospects in the country after scoring 96 per cent in a national test			1
he was on a six - seat ski lift when the tragedy struck they are accused of failing to enforce a rule banning skiers from boarding the lift while wearing backpacks , not carrying out daily checks on equipment and not ensuring a safety device which could stop the lift was properly installed			1

@entity9 , a pupil at @entity87 , who was one of the brightest maths prospects in the country after scoring 96 per cent in a national test , was on a six - seat ski lift when the tragedy struck			1
it is believed his backpack got stuck on the lift chair as he tried to climb off at the top of the slope			2
@entity9 was suspended by his clothing for around four minutes before he was released , according to witnesses			2

he was transferred to the @entity105 intensive care unit where he died nearly a month later on march 17 , 2011			1
mr @entity9 said : ' it feels so very fresh because we are still going over the events in our mind			2
@entity33 and @entity34 , the parents of @entity9 ( pictured ) , have said they want to establish the sequence of events that led to his death so no other family will suffer a similar tragedy ' i think it is natural as parents to ask the questions : could more have been done to save @entity9 , did he suffer , what went wrong and what can be done to prevent this from ever happening to another family ? ' it is like we have an open wound that we can not close because we do n't have the resources at our disposal			1
' the hole in our life left by @entity9 will always be there - all the future we would have had together is missing			2
' it 's so difficult not being able yet to point at something positive to come from this tragedy - some safety improvements that we can say were made as a result of what we learned from @entity9 's death			2
' hopefully , the trial will help us understand			0
' mrs @entity34 , 52 , also an @entity45 manager , said : ' he was academically bright but also loved to be physically active and was a member of the army cadets			0
' @entity9 dreamed of becoming a doctor and helping people			0
he wanted to be a gp			0
we could n't bury @entity9 for six months because of the police investigation			0
' we also could n't donate his organs which was something that would have given us some comfort			0
the comfort that we 're looking for now is that we can say that something good came of this , that lessons have been learnt from this which will make things safer			0
' the family 's lawyer @entity158 , of @entity160 and @entity161 , said : ' the @entity8 prosecutor has enough evidence to bring two charges of involuntary manslaughter in this case against the pilot of the ski lift and the company which employed him			1
' it has been devastating for @entity9 's family to lose a much - loved son in these circumstances			0
but they are determined that the full facts of what happened are revealed and any safety failings exposed so that no other family has to suffer a similar tragedy again			0
