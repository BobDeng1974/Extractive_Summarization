click here to read @entity2 's full column			0
the funny thing is , some folk still wonder if @entity5 will get back to the top			2
it is an absolute inevitability			0
and not long - term , either			0
if not , the year after			0
@entity10 will bring the title to @entity12			0
that is what modern football demands , that is what the rules dictate			0
@entity18 decided several years ago that they wanted football to remain exactly as it was that day , and introduced regulation to facilitate a natural order			0
and as on that day @entity5 were the biggest club in @entity26 , that is how they shall remain			1
@entity27 ( centre ) shows some frustration during @entity31 's match against @entity32 on sunday @entity27 celebrates after scoring for @entity31 against @entity32 in the @entity34 clash so , now , if @entity27 is available there is one club that can buy him			1
not afford him , mark you			0
@entity38 , @entity39 and a number of others could afford him if their owners were allowed to invest speculatively in their business			1
@entity44 or @entity45 might calculate that acquiring @entity27 would be a catalyst for the next stage of development ; not just in what he might bring as a footballer , but in the global statement such a move would make			2
they might decide that , despite the astronomical cost , the end would justify the means if what it gave @entity38 or @entity39 was a rapidly expanded fanbase and increased marketing potential			1
but then a man in a suit would step in and say no , or impose a punitive fine or , worse , a ban from major competition			0
this leaves one club with the potential to make @entity27 ’s numbers add up			1
it is unlikely @entity27 will arrive at @entity12 , either way			2
much of what is being said in @entity31 appears to be a power play , or contractual brinkmanship			1
@entity27 rails against false speculation one moment , and then uses the platform of the @entity75 to announce that he does not know where he will be next season			2
@entity5 boss @entity10 walks down the touchline after defeat by @entity80 on sunday @entity83 ( left ) , @entity27 ( centre ) and his girlfriend @entity82 sit beside each other at the @entity86 award ceremony in @entity87 on monday night all is not well with @entity31 coach @entity88 , apparently , and @entity27 wants an improved deal			1
the clever money says that he will get what he wants on both counts : a different coach and a new contract			0
if not @entity27 for @entity5 then , what of @entity83 or @entity96 ? actually , the names are incidental			1
the bottom line is that there are some calculations that are beyond all bar one club			0
even by bringing in @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 on loan in one window , @entity5 demonstrated a financial capability that outstripped all rivals , particularly having failed to qualify for the @entity113			1
no other club could take a hit of £ 50million , as @entity5 did , and continue investing in this way			1
obviously , @entity5 need @entity113 football from here to finance any grand plan , yet the mathematics of the @entity27 deal bring home the lopsided logic of @entity24 , effectively delivering the hope of success to a privileged few			1
@entity80 — incredible interlopers this season — should be able to cement their position , or at least build on it , with ambitious transfer dealing in the january transfer window , having defeated @entity5 at @entity12			2
@entity31 fans show their support for @entity27 by displaying a banner at the @entity135 on sunday while @entity18 would closely monitor this new investment , however , @entity5 — and @entity5 alone — could plan a bid for @entity27 that might top £ 275m , including a £ 195m buy - out clause			1
so what chance do @entity80 have , long - term ? that 1 - 0 win on sunday ? means nothing			0
dropping down to fourth place ? a tiny bump in the road for @entity5			2
we are not witnessing the beginning of the wilderness years because @entity18 will not allow it			0
the worst that can happen is a temporary delay on the road back to the top			0
@entity5 can never be mediocre again			2
it is unthinkable they will ever go 26 years between titles , as happened from 1967 to 1993			0
@entity38 are out of the running for players like @entity27 , and they know it			1
their accounts are already under extreme scrutiny from @entity18 and the purchase of @entity159 from @entity160 is as close as they can manage to a spree			0
there is also much talk about @entity39 and @entity27 but that is moot , too			1
a frosty relationship with manager @entity167 is said to have thawed , but who cares ? @entity167 knows the reality			0
the club accountant will have the final say on @entity27 , not him			1
@entity167 gestures towards @entity27 during @entity174 's @entity113 semi-final second leg against @entity31 at the @entity135 in april 2010 asked about the deal last month , @entity167 said : ‘ i have no chance of that with @entity27			1
at this moment there is @entity24 and we have to follow certain rules , certain numbers and we have no conditions to buy a super , amazing player paid with super , amazing numbers			2
’ he is too confident in his ability to regard ultimate defeat as unavoidable , but it certainly seems that way			0
if @entity193 is as good a coach as his record suggests , this , coupled with @entity5 ’s financial supremacy only has one outcome , with or without @entity27 .			1

there is only one club that can buy @entity27 if he is available
@entity24 means @entity39 and @entity38 are out of the running
@entity5 demonstrated a financial capability that outstripped all rivals
