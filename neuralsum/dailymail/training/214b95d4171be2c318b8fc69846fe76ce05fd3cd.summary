by @entity0 published : 07:46 est , 8 july 2013 updated : 03:43 est , 9 july 2013 former @entity2 prime minister @entity1 has called for @entity2 to take action over @entity4 and instate a no - fly zone @entity1 has called for a no - fly zone in @entity4 as tensions heighten between rebel forces and president @entity10 's soldiers			1
the former prime minister has criticised the @entity2 government 's lack of action and failure to intervene in the war - torn country			1
he claimed the civil war has caused more deaths - believed to be more than 93,000 since march 2011 - than during the entire @entity21 conflict which began in 2003			2
speaking on @entity23 's today programme , he said : ' personally i think we should at least consider and consider actively a no - fly zone in @entity4			1
' mr @entity1 also claimed that @entity2 should help arm the rebels to help them topple @entity10 - arguing that inaction only serve to lengthen the conflict			1
he added : ' a refusal to engage , as you see from what ’s happening in @entity4 at the moment , where , after all , as a proportion of the population there ’s now been more people that have died in @entity4 in a civil war that shows absolutely no sign of ending than in the entirety of @entity21 since 2003			2
so , you know , inaction is also a policy and a decision with consequence			0
' the thing we ’ve got to understand about this region is that there are people intervening			0
so if we disengage , it ’s not that these disputes are playing themselves out within their countries			0
' mr @entity1 also insisted that @entity2 should also assist the @entity56 military , who last week ousted @entity58 as president after he failed to come to a resolution with demonstrators within a 48 - hour deadline			2
clashes : violence between rebel soldiers , pictured in @entity66 , south of the @entity4 capital @entity69 yesterday , and president @entity10 's troops continues to escalate @entity72 - the head of the @entity73 - has replaced him as interim president as part of an interim civilian administration			0
but the @entity78 has urged @entity56 to rise up against the military as fears heighten the country could descend into civil war			0
at least 30 islamists were killed during protests over the ' military coup '			0
but mr @entity1 argues @entity2 should be getting behind the military , stating : ' the only way you ’re going to get back to a proper democratic path is to support the government			1
' contrast : @entity1 , pictured with troops in the port of @entity93 , @entity21 , while still prime minister in 2003 , argues that more people have lost their lives in the @entity4 civil war than in the @entity21 conflict			1
