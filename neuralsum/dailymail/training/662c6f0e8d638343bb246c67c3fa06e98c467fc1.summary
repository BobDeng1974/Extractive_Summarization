@entity0 may be a driving force behind super-intelligent computers , but he 's also one of the most outspoken people on its dangers			2
he has previously described it as ' summoning the demon ' and a threat that is ' more dangerous than nukes			0
' now the @entity11 - founder says he is donating $ 10 million ( £ 6.6 million ) to the @entity12 for research on how to keep artificial intelligence safe			1
he has previously said : ' i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			0
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it 's probably that ' in a tweet announcing his investment , the 43 - year - old , said it is ' all fun and games ' until something goes awry			2
earlier this week , @entity0 joined @entity31 and other prominent scientists in signing an open letter to ensure @entity35 research benefits humanity			1
the letter warns that without safeguards on intelligent machines , mankind could be heading for a dark future			1
the document , drafted by the @entity12 , said scientists should seek to head off risks that could wipe out mankind			1
in a tweet announcing his investment , the 43 - year - old , said it is ' all fun and games ' until something goes awry the authors say there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity35 research is making good progress and would have a growing impact on society			1
it highlights speech recognition , image analysis , driverless cars , translation and robot motion as having benefited from the research			1
' the potential benefits are huge , since everything that civilisation has to offer is a product of human intelligence ; we can not predict what we might achieve when this intelligence is magnified by the tools @entity35 may provide , but the eradication of disease and poverty are not unfathomable , ' the authors write			2
but it issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity35 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			1
earlier this week , a group of scientists and entrepreneurs , including @entity0 and @entity31 ( pictured ) , have signed an open letter promising to ensure @entity35 research benefits humanity for instance , in the short term , it claims @entity35 may put millions of people out of work			1
in the long term , it could have the potential to play out like a fictional dystopias in which intelligence greater than humans could begin acting against their programming			1
' our ai systems must do what we want them to do , ' the letter says			2
' many economists and computer scientists agree that there is valuable research to be done on how to maximise the economic benefits of @entity35 while mitigating adverse effects , which could include increased inequality and unemployment			1
' other signatories to the @entity12 's letter include @entity115 , executive director of @entity116 and @entity117 , professor of physics at the @entity119 and a @entity121 laureate			1
the letter comes just weeks after professor @entity31 warned that @entity35 could someday overtake humans			1
@entity124 has set up an ethics board to oversee its work in artificial intelligence			2
the search giant has recently bought several robotics companies , along with @entity130 , a @entity132 firm creating software that tries to help computers think like humans			0
one of its founders warned artificial intelligence is ' number one risk for this century , ' and believes it could play a part in human extinction ' eventually , i think human extinction will probably occur , and technology will likely play a part in this , ' @entity145 's @entity144 said in a recent interview			0
among all forms of technology that could wipe out the human species , he singled out artificial intelligence , or @entity35 , as the ' number 1 risk for this century			2
' the ethics board , revealed by web site @entity159 , is to ensure the projects are not abused			0
neuroscientist @entity161 , 37 , founded @entity145 two years ago with the aim of trying to help computers think like humans			0
speaking at event in @entity167 , the physicist told the @entity168 : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			0
' this echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said success in creating @entity35 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			1
' in november , @entity0 , the entrepreneur behind @entity11 and @entity180 , warned that the risk of ' something seriously dangerous happening ' as a result of machines with artificial intelligence , could be in as few as five years			2
speaking at the @entity119 ( @entity119 ) @entity186 in october , @entity0 described artificial intelligence as our ' biggest existential threat '			0
he said : ' i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			0
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it 's probably that			0
so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence			0
' i 'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight , maybe at the national and international level , just to make sure that we do n't do something very foolish			0
' with artificial intelligence we 're summoning the demon			0
you know those stories where there 's the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and … he 's sure he can control the demon ? does n't work out			0
' the letter issued a stark warning that research into the rewards of @entity35 had to be matched with an equal effort to avoid the potential damage it could wreak			1

the @entity11 - founder is donating the money to the @entity12
earlier this week the organisation issued an open letter on @entity35 threats
letter said there is a ' broad consensus ' that @entity35 is making good progress
areas benefiting from @entity35 research include driverless cars and robot motion
but in the short term , it warns @entity35 may put millions of people out of work
in the long term , robots could become far more intelligent than humans
