@entity1 militants have publicly crucified and murdered a teenager they accused of taking photographs of the terror group 's headquarters in @entity6			1
sickening images purportedly taken in the central square of the extremists ' @entity9 show the battered and bloodstained body of an unnamed 17 - year - old boy strapped to a cross			1
a handwritten placard hangs around the teenager 's neck , accusing him of ' apostasy ' - the abandonment of his religion - and says he had been crucified for three days after being caught receiving 500 @entity20 lira for every photograph he took of an @entity1 military base			1
the group is made up of a handful of incredibly brave individuals who oppose @entity43 and - despite the city being the group 's de facto , the centre of its leadership and full of bloodthirsty religious police - attempt to document the violence the terrorists group has brought to their hometown			1
the image has been circulated on @entity48 both by @entity50 campaigners and by @entity43 supporters , who sickeningly trumpet it as a positive example of the group 's brutal interpretation of @entity56			1
@entity58 , programs officer at counter-extremism think tank the @entity60 , said crucifixion is a prescribed punishment meted out by @entity43 for specific crimes			0
' crucifixion has been used many times before â€“ it 's an age - old punishment dealt out to people who have committed treason , ' he told @entity69			2
horror : @entity32 's central square has been bathed in blood since the terror group fully seized control of the city earlier in the year the @entity1 's use of crucifixion as a punishment stems from its fundamentalist interpretation of @entity79 of the fifth book of the @entity81			1
the verse reads : ' indeed , the penalty for those who wage war against @entity86 and his messenger and strive upon earth [ to cause ] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land			2
' ' that is for them a disgrace in this world ; and for them in the hereafter is a great punishment			0
' despite this , @entity43 chooses to ignore the next passage which emphasises forgiveness and removes the imperative to use such a punishment , saying : ' except for those who return [ repenting ] before you apprehend them			0
and know that @entity86 is forgiving and @entity110			0
' @entity32 's central square has been bathed in blood since the terror group fully seized control of the city earlier in the year			1
severed heads are regularly displayed impaled on spikes surrounding a small patch of grass in the square , and there are a number of wooden and metal crosses standing ready for the next execution			0
@entity1 militants have publicly beheaded two of their own fighters after they were accused of ' banditry ' and spying on behalf of the @entity6 government			0
the executions took place in the @entity6 city of @entity134 after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group 's police force and brought before a @entity140 law court			1
one of the men was successfully tried on charges of ' banditry and robbing @entity145 ' money ' , while the second man was convicted of ' spying and embezzlement ' , with both being sentenced to being beheaded in the centre of @entity134 , which is on the @entity150 near the border with @entity152			0
terrorists : @entity1 militants have publicly executed two of their own fighters after they were accused of ' banditry ' and spying on behalf of the @entity6 government news of the executions came from the @entity158 , a @entity159 - based group monitoring violence in @entity6 using sources on the ground			2
the first man , they said , was convicted of ' banditry and robbing @entity145 ' money ' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury			2
the second militants was accused of ' dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of @entity175 , ' according to the observatory			0
the use of the phrase ' electronic chips ' is understood to refer to small geolocation devices that can be hidden inside @entity43 - held buildings or vehicles belonging to senior militants			2
the devices can then provide @entity6 regime warplanes with detailed information on which to base a bombing raid .			0
