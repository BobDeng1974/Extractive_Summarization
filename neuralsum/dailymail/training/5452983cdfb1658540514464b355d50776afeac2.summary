dolphins are known for their playful , inquisitive nature and even for saving humans who have got into trouble at sea			0
but the intelligent mammals are not so kind to harbour porpoises			1
marine experts are investigating after one of the small mammals was allegedly murdered by a pod of bottlenose dolphins in @entity12			1
brutal : marine experts are investigating after a porpoise ( pictured being thrown in the air ) was allegedly murdered by a pod of dolphins the lifeless body of the small porpoise was found floating in @entity20 by a research team on wednesday			1
days earlier , the @entity22 had witnessed a dolphin - attack on a harbour porpoise of a similar size and it is thought to be the same as the one that was found dead			1
experts watched as three dolphins preyed on their smaller marine cousin			2
dr @entity33 - @entity32 , monitoring officer for @entity22 , claimed the attack left the porpoise unable to swim properly			1
a sad sight : the lifeless body of the porpoise ( pictured ) was found floating in @entity20 , @entity12 , by a research team on wednesday a sustained attack : dr @entity33 - @entity32 , monitoring officer for @entity22 , claimed the attack left the porpoise ( pictured being tossed in the air ) unable to swim after the dolphins repeatedly hit its side the harbour porpoise ( @entity43 ) is one of six species of porpoise			1
it is one of the smallest marine mammals and typically stays close to the coast or in river estuaries			0
the creature gets its name from @entity54 , which means pig fish			0
harbour porpoises have been known to dive 721 feet ( 220 metres ) and can hold their breath for up to five minutes			2
up until 2008 , scientists were baffled about why quite large numbers of the small marine mammals were found dead - and the @entity63 navy was even blamed for scores of dead porpoises in @entity66			2
but then tell - tale teeth marks were identified and examinations of the harbour porpoises ' bodies revealed broken ribs , imploding lungs and internal bleeding , from prolonged dolphin attacks , @entity67 reported			1
most cases of the attacks have been documented along the east coast of @entity79 and off the coast of @entity66			0
she said : ‘ we saw the much larger dolphins hitting the animal on its side			2
’ ‘ this violent behaviour is not unusual between these two species			0
‘ however , the opportunity to witness it so close at hand and to be able to record it so well is quite special			0
’ harbour porpoises measure almost four feet ( 1.2metres ) and five feet ( 1.5metres ) long when fully grown , and are dwarfed by their larger cousins , the bottlenose dolphin			1
bottlenose dolphins in @entity96 waters can reach up to 14 feet ( 4.3 metres ) in length , which is the largest size for this species of dolphin anywhere in the world			1
the assault was observed by a research team from @entity22 who were aboard a boat called the @entity105 , run by @entity106			0
another team , who discovered the dead porpoise days later , reported their find to the @entity96 @entity111 ( @entity111 )			0
the group deals with all reports of dead and stranded whales , dolphins and porpoises , and conducts post-mortems where appropriate			0
the @entity111 team will now investigate the cause of death of the porpoise but the condition of the animal looked consistent with bottlenose dolphin attacks previously observed			2
examinations of some harbour porpoises after an attack have previously revealed broken ribs , imploding lungs and massive internal bleeding			1
the assault ( pictured ) was observed by a research team from @entity22 who were aboard a boat called @entity105			0
here , the porpoise is flipped upside down by a dolphin attacking from below			0

the lifeless body of a harbour porpoise thought to have been attacked by dolphins was found floating in @entity20 , @entity12 on wednesday
days earlier , experts witnessed a brutal attack on a similar - sized animal
*conservationists* think that the dolphin attack - which *involved* repeated *ramming* - left the harbour porpoise unable to swim properly
harbour porpoises are considerably smaller than bottlenose dolphins and the two species are known to have come to blows before
