tens of thousands of middle - aged adults are developing dementia , a report will warn this week			1
more than 42,000 @entity4 under the age of 65 are thought to have the illness - twice as many as was previously thought			1
this includes 2,000 who are in their forties			0
charities warn that many adults are coming to terms with the condition whilst still working , looking after children and paying off their mortgage			1
they are also concerned that doctors are misdiagnosing many younger sufferers as they assume dementia mainly occurs in the elderly			2
fears : a new study has found that 42,000 people in the @entity4 are suffering from early - onset dementia but a report by the @entity25 to be published on wednesday will warn that twice as many adults are developing dementia in mid-life than previously thought			1
there are now 42,325 cases of early onset dementia in @entity4 – which occurs before the age of 65 – previously there were only thought to be 17,000 cases			1
this includes 2,010 in their 40s , 7,700 cases in their 50s , 32,000 in their 60s and 707 cases in their 30s			0
men are slightly more at risk than women – they account for 21,519 cases compared to 20,806			0
and overall , the under 65s are believed to account for a third of all cases of dementia			2
@entity51 , chief executive at @entity25 said : ‘ for too long dementia has been perceived as a natural part of ageing which only affects the oldest of the old in our society			2
‘ say the word @entity60 and many people picture a frail , elderly person in a care home			0
‘ the risk of developing dementia does increase with age , but the reality is that dementia is caused by diseases of the brain that do n’t discriminate			1
worrying : the report will also warn that the numbers of @entity4 with early - onset dementia will rise by a fifth by 2051			1
file picture ‘ many people will be coming to terms with the symptoms while still in work , perhaps looking after children and paying a mortgage			2
‘ too often we hear of people reporting memory loss to their doctor in mid-life , but being misdiagnosed because they are considered too young to have dementia			2
’ the report will also warn that the numbers of @entity4 with early - onset dementia will rise by a fifth by 2051 to 50,000 cases			1
many of those who develop the illness at a younger age have a family history although it is also triggered by alcohol and linked to @entity96			1
the most recent figures show that 850,000 @entity4 have dementia although the report this week will warn the numbers are significantly higher			1
ministers are becoming increasingly concerned at the burden the illness is placing on the health service			2
and despite decades of research , drug companies have failed to find a cure or even a treatment to halt the illness ’s progression			0
last year @entity111 promised to double the funding for dementia research in the hope of that there will be a major breakthrough by 2025			0
recently there have been a number of setbacks and several drugs which initially seemed promising were later found to be ineffective			0
researchers are now focusing their efforts on developing treatments to give to patients very early on possibly before symptoms develop			0
the few existing drugs only work in people who are diagnosed very early on and they only temporarily halt the disease ’s progression			0
symptoms include memory problems , confusion , hallucinations and problems with language , speech and moving around			0
on average patients live for between eight and ten years after symptoms first occur but it varies hugely between individuals .			0

more than 42,000 @entity4 under the age of 65 are thought to have the illness
many adults have the condition while working and looking after children
