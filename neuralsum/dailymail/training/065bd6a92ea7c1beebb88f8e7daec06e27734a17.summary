a police force making cuts of £ 50million is using unqualified detectives to investigate serious crimes because of a ' critical ' shortage of staff			1
a whistleblower said officers had been moved into the @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 - which deals with murders and rapes - without taking compulsory detective exams			1
@entity14 has now admitted officers had to be moved into @entity16 ' temporarily ' to keep up the numbers , prompting a warning from the county 's police commissioner			1
shortage : police in @entity9 ( pictured ) admitted they were facing what they called ' challenging times ' the whistleblower reported his concerns to local newspaper the @entity27			1
there was a ' critical shortage of police officers across the entire @entity9 and @entity33 division , ' the anonymous detective said			2
he added : ' officers are having to be drafted in from other departments with almost no notice and with many of these officers not even having passed the detectives exam - a national requirement - and with little or no additional training to prepare them for dealing with the serious crimes investigated by @entity8			2
' it is not uncommon to see my colleagues on the verge of tears because they are under so much pressure and stress and have more work than they can cope with			0
under stress : a whistleblower said many colleagues were close to tears ( file photo ) ' this is nothing short of scandalous and not only puts the public at increased risk but the officers themselves			1
' a spokesman for @entity14 admitted there were officers working in @entity8 without the relevant qualifications but insisted they were all ' experienced investigators			1
' the spokesman also admitted the department was not operating at a 100 per cent staffing level			0
superintendent @entity67 , of @entity14 , said : ' policing , by its very nature , requires a flexible approach			2
' often this means moving officers , all of whom are trained and competent to investigate crime , into different departments			0
' this is why we have recently temporarily moved a number of people into our @entity8 to ensure that we can continue to respond effectively to crimes such as rape and sexual assault			0
' we are going through challenging times at the moment and having to make some difficult decisions regarding our resources but , as with all our decision making , the needs of the public always come first			2
' @entity14 and crime commissioner @entity92 said she would investigate and public safety remains her highest priority			0
she added : ' should i find any evidence that officer and staff resilience is affecting police performance i will hold the chief constable to account for this on behalf of @entity104 residents			0
' @entity14 came under fire by inspectors last year after axing frontline officers in a bid to meet government - imposed cuts of £ 50million between 2011 and 2015			1
cuts of £ 50million : @entity14 's headquarters			1
the force was criticised by inspectors last year @entity114 revealed the force was one of just three in the country reducing its number of frontline staff			2
' the force is not managing to protect its frontline crime fighting capability as effectively as it should , ' the report said			0
the report acknowledged the challenge was tough because @entity104 had lower costs than other forces , but it added : ' there are early indications that the service to the public might be starting to diminish			0
' over the last two years @entity104 has reduced crime at a substantially lower rate than most other forces			0
