proving that legendary singer - songwriters sometimes get the words to the national anthem mixed up too , @entity1 began singing ' @entity10 ' instead of ' @entity11			1
' like the seasoned pro he is , @entity1 , 65 , quickly recovered , singing , ' o say can you see , ' in the very next breath			1
@entity1 returned in the seventh inning stretch to sing ' @entity10 , ' explaining his earlier gaffe			2
the second song was in honor of the @entity30 victims and survivors			0
@entity1 , a @entity33 inductee and @entity5 resident , also performed in honor of @entity5 bombing victim police officer @entity36 in april			0
@entity37 sang out @entity11 a cappella before wednesday 's @entity4 kick - off game in @entity5			1
gone to @entity40 : @entity1 was only momentarily confused before launching into a beautiful rendition of ' @entity11 ' the @entity42 beat the @entity43 four - two on thursday			2
being asked to sing the national anthem at a sporting event is an honor for any artist , but they do n't always get it right			0
@entity50 has listed some of the worst performances of all time - a list that puts @entity1 's misstep to shame			0
@entity56 performed at the @entity57 2011 and changed the words to the national anthem 's fourth @entity59 in 2003 scrawled the lyrics on his palm when he performed at a @entity43 versus @entity64 game making him very unpopular			2
and near the top of the list is @entity67 , whose 1990 performance involved crotch - grabbing , off - key yelling and spitting .			0

@entity1 began singing the wrong song before the @entity4 game 2 thursday
he quickly recovered and *smoothly* *transitioned* into ' @entity11 '
later in the game , @entity1 sang ' @entity10 ' , the song he *accidentally* sang instead of the national anthem
