by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity2 is hoping his luck has finally turned after ending his 26 - race drought without a podium in sunday 's @entity7 @entity6			1
behind a @entity8 one - two spearheaded by @entity9 , @entity2 was the best of the rest , claiming his first top - three spot since joining @entity13 at the start of this year , and first since the @entity15 gp in may last year			1
the fact it came at @entity18 , on home soil of @entity20 , a team he spent eight years with prior to switching to @entity13 , only added to the significance for the 33 - year - old @entity23			1
finally : @entity2 celebrates his long - overdue podium finish at @entity18 in a season when @entity2 has endured some wretched luck on occasion , and after watching team - mate @entity28 claim four podium finishes in five grands prix prior to sunday 's race , his result was long overdue			1
' i 've not been very lucky in some of the races this season , ' said @entity2			0
' but the luck is on our side i 'm sure now , and from now to the last race we 're going to be there fighting			0
' i 'm so happy to be on the podium , and there 's a lot more to come			0
' with @entity28 fourth , @entity13 have now leapfrogged @entity20 in the battle for third place in the constructors ' championship , and the multi-million pound windfall that would come with that			2
third : @entity2 finished behind @entity9 ( centre ) and @entity53 in the @entity7 @entity6 support : @entity23 flags were among those cheering on the podium finish it has been a remarkable turnaround this year for @entity13 who , with 177 points to their name so far this campaign , have scored more this season than in the past four combined since the new scoring system was introduced			1
@entity2 added : ' it 's amazing to see how @entity13 were last year and now we are fighting with big teams			2
' it 's really good for the whole team , and i really hope we can get this third place in the constructors ' championship , which would be fantastic for the whole team			0
' @entity2 , though , dismissed suggestions his result and performance on @entity20 territory was a message to his former employers			0
kiss : @entity2 salutes the crowd after the race tight corner : the @entity23 put in his best performance of the season to seal third place rivalry : @entity28 has been @entity13 ' no.1 this season but @entity2 outperformed the @entity90 at @entity18 ' i had an incredible time with @entity20 who are in my heart , and they will always be there , ' said @entity2			1
' but i 'm not driving for @entity20 any more , we ( @entity13 ) are fighting against them , @entity99 , @entity8 , and we need to do everything we can to be in front of them			2
' we did a fantastic job to be on the podium , so it 's a message we 're competitive , that we are there , that we are fighting			0
