we think probably a lot of them were maybe made for eccentric collectors			0
@entity62 and @entity61 also on display in the @entity64 and wonder : the @entity67 exhibition ' others maybe were made on the back of the @entity71 film adaptations and the renewed popularity of the vampire story but one or two of them may actually be genuine survivals from the @entity21 era			2
