@entity0 took a chunk of @entity2 's ' tukhus ' for misleading the public about his signature health insurance overhaul @entity0 , the aging comedian best known for his borscht - belt @entity6 schtick , slammed president @entity2 on sunday as a compulsive liar who sounds ' like a maniac in an asylum ' when he talks about health care			1
' he 's saying things that nobody believes , ' said @entity0 , 82 , during an interview broadcast on @entity15 in @entity16			1
' he was always lying every day of his life			0
every time he talks it was a lie			0
the only time he tells the truth is when you did n't hear from him			0
' @entity0 took issue with @entity2 's repeated pledge that @entity24 who wanted to keep their health insurance plans would be able to do so even after the @entity26 became law			1
the @entity28 has since awarded that promise its dreaded ' four @entity31 ' rating , the least - truthful grade its fact - checker offers			2
' this is becoming so ridiculous , that even the biggest liar ca n’t top himself , ' @entity0 said of @entity2 , the conservative @entity35 website was first to report			1
' he looks at you straight in the face , and tells you that if you want your plan , you got your plan , you keep your plan			2
now , a month and a half later , you got no plan , you lost your plan , and he tells you you still got a plan			2
' ' it 's such a ridiculous thing , ' he added			2
' the whole country 's walking around wondering if this guy 's really the president of a country			1
he sounds more like a maniac in an asylum			0
' ' if this is a president of a country , how come he 's the only one in @entity24 who does n't seem to know what 's going on here ? ' scroll down for audio read my lips : @entity2 has taken flak for saying that @entity24 who liked their pre-obamacare medical insurance plans would be allowed to keep them @entity0 said he believes @entity2 's multiple statements that ' if you like your plan , you can keep your plan ' are lies , not simple misstatements , as a weekend @entity70 editorial alleged			1
' never did i expect a guy like this – the head of a country – to blatantly lie to your face , ' he said , ' and then not only lie to your face , then lie about the fact that he never lied			0
then lie again about the next lie he told			0
' @entity2 , said @entity0 , is ' the only guy in @entity24 who would have the nerve to lie this much			1
' sunday 's comments were n't the first time @entity0 has made headlines for attacking the president			1
during a stand - up performance in 2009 he referred to @entity2 using the @entity86 word ' schvartze , ' which some commentators took as an outdated racial epithet			1
others , including @entity0 , contended that the word is simply a literal translation of the word ' black			1
' ' @entity95 has told a lot more jokes about whites than i have against blacks , ' the cnoservative comic later said			0
' what about the demeaning words blacks say about @entity6 ? if it 's a racist society , the white people are the ones being persecuted because they have to defend themselves			0
' @entity0 has never been a shrinking violet , but has become more and more vocal about his dislike of president @entity2 conservative commentators have made hay over cancellation letters going to millions of @entity24 who thought their existing health care plans would pass muster under the @entity26 in 2001 @entity0 attacked the president for holding a @entity118 @entity117 observance 12 days early so it would n't interrupt his family vacation			1
' the way i see it , ' @entity2 had said , ' we 're just extending the holiday spirit			2
we 're stretching it out			0
but we do have to be careful that your kids do n't start thinking @entity117 lasts 20 nights instead of eight			2
that will cause some problems			0
' i do n't even think he knew that he was talking about something that 's @entity6 , ' he said days later			2
' it could have been @entity134 , it could have been altogether a religion he never even heard of			0
he does n't know , he does n't care			0
he 's strictly in there to take a picture , and the picture could have been about anything he claimed that the president only held the event because his @entity6 advisors had told him ' " @entity117 is a good idea " ' if he wanted to increase his appeal to @entity6 voters in the following year 's election			1
' " you do n't have to go any place , " ' he imagined them saying			0
' " we 'll put down the tchotchke and you 'll see a candle , you 'll light it from this side , " and that 's enough information for him to accumulate without a teleprompter			0
so he did it in 10 minutes			0
' old - timer : @entity0 's heyday was in the 1960s and 1970s , shown here ( r ) with legendary variety show host @entity161 ( @entity163 ) ' you want me to tell you the truth ? ' he said then			1
' i do n’t think he cares , or knows or remembers which hanukkah it is , or what @entity117 means			2
' in 2012 @entity0 attacked @entity2 after his open - mic gaffe and was heard telling @entity172 president @entity171 that he would have more ' flexibility ' in his policymaking after he was re-elected			1
the president , he claimed , had showed himself to be ' a fake and a fraud ' who ' hates this country			2
' he also called @entity2 a ' completely crooked lowlife ' after news reports claimed the @entity118 had leaked @entity183 's plan for military attacks against @entity185 just weeks before last year 's election			1
@entity183 prime minister @entity187 later said that those attacks were called off at the @entity2 administration 's request			1
' a guy like this should be locked up , ' @entity0 said sunday			1
' if he was n’t the president , he ’d be in jail or in a sanitarium			0
he would n’t be outside talking to people in this condition			0
he would be considered a danger to his own his own health , to his own life			0
