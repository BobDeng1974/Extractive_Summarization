who says cats hate water ? @entity3 this week launched its new , second - generation @entity5 compact sports saloon with a high - wire drive over water on cables just an inch thick			1
in a stunt worthy of the latest @entity11 — for which the firm is supplying many of the cars — the @entity5 was revealed in a dramatic stunt in the heart of @entity18 's @entity17			1
high over the @entity24 in @entity25 , stuntman @entity19 — a veteran of the @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 films — drove the car 240 metres across wires to demonstrate the car 's lightweight aluminium construction and agility			1
do n't look down ! @entity3 's new xf seen crossing @entity18 's @entity24 by high wire this week excitement aside , @entity3 's @entity5 sport saloon promises ' business class ' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines			1
it 's being built at @entity42 's @entity41 factory in @entity43 alongside the allaluminium @entity45 sports car and top - of - the - range @entity47 limousine			1
its official global debut is at the @entity51 motor show on april 1 before going on sale in the autumn from £ 30,000 to £ 80,000			1
@entity3 's @entity54 ( pictured ) promises ' business class ' levels of comfort and refinement with a new generation of frugal engines the new version is 80kg lighter than its closest competitor			1
this helps it return more than 70 mpg with @entity66 emissions of 104g/km			0
engines include 163bhp and 180bhp 2 - litre @entity69 diesels linked to six - speed manual and eight - speed automatic gearboxes			0
the manual 163bhp diesel is ' the lightest , most efficient non-hybrid diesel model in its market segment , ' says @entity3			1
all other engines are eightspeed automatics			0
there is also a powerful 3 - litre 300bhp @entity79 twinturbo diesel and a 3 - litre 380 bhp @entity79 supercharged petrol engine			0
the proportions have also been tweaked			0
while 7mm shorter and 3mm lower than its predecessor , its wheelbase is 51mm longer , meaning more back seat space , legroom and headroom			0
@entity3 is investing £ 600 million in its manufacturing capacity in @entity89 , £ 400million at its @entity41 plant			1
great to see @entity89 's former ' @entity91 ' — @entity92 , once the capital of our motor industry — getting some bumper good news this week			1
the city that for decades has built the iconic @entity18 taxi is to gain a new factory , costing £ 250million , creating up to 1,000 jobs and building up to 36,000 vehicles a year			0
@entity103 motor giant @entity102 , which bought the @entity89 firm outright two years ago after holding a stake since 2006 , said the state - of the - art research , development and assembly plant for the @entity109 will be built in the city of @entity111 ( and @entity112 )			2
it is a tenfold increase on the company 's site , which has been home to @entity18 taxis for 70 years and heralds the introduction of the next generation electric and ultralow emission @entity18 black cab			2
@entity92 's links with @entity103 go back a long way after it had the foresight in the early eighties to twin itself with the @entity103 city of @entity128 in @entity130 province			2
what the two cities had in common was silk : @entity128 is at the end of the @entity135 and @entity92 — before the rise of the motor industry — was a centre for the finest silk - working			2
the @entity103 think long - term and have an important concept called guanxi — or social connections — which help smooth business			0
@entity92 was early to establish these vital connections			0
looks like it 's paying off			0
april should put a spring in the step of outdoor touring types as order books open for the new generation of @entity150 's epic seven - seat luxury sport utility vehicle the @entity151			1
but you 'll have to wait until august for first deliveries			0
in april order books open for the new generation of @entity150 's epic seven - seat luxury sport utility vehicle the @entity151 ( pictured ) priced from £ 50,340 to £ 53,835 , it will be available at launch with a 272 bhp @entity159 engine			2
a 218bhp @entity160 is expected to follow in late summer 2015			0
and finally ... what possible future could there be for a loud , middle - aged , overweight , motormouth petrolhead who 's originally from ' up @entity167 ' , is always behind the wheel of some fancy car or other , divides opinion , drives everyone nuts and is not even that funny ? wonder if i should apply for that vacant @entity177 slot now that whatsisname 's gone and got the sack ?			2

the stunt was worthy of the latest @entity21 film , @entity182
the car was driven 240 metres above the @entity185 in @entity25
@entity3 's new saloon promises ' business class ' levels of comfort
its official global debut is at the @entity51 motor show on april 1
