there are times when managers tighten up before a big match night and tension fills the air			0
minutes before the @entity9 coach took training here before their @entity13 tie against @entity14 , the names of @entity16 and @entity17 were enough to get him going			1
it was passionate and protective , absorbing to listen to as he defended @entity17 ’s honour and instructed @entity22 ’s head coach @entity21 to leave @entity16 out of his squad			2
@entity16 is not here , out of action since he injured his thigh on @entity22 duty last month			0
@entity17 celebrates his derby goal against @entity29 in front of his adoring @entity9 fans @entity6 talks tactics with his team as the rain pours down and @entity17 looks on @entity6 laughs during the press conference before the game with @entity14 on wednesday night on thursday , as the forward nears a return to action this weekend against @entity40 , @entity21 intends to select him for @entity42 qualifiers against @entity43 and @entity44			1
this , as everyone involved in these untidy club - versus - country spats is aware , is dangerous territory			0
@entity6 , though , is resolute			2
‘ i have not spoken to @entity21 since the injury , ’ admitted @entity9 ’s manager			2
‘ we have good dialogue and he knows that he can call and speak about any of the players			0
@entity9 have met @entity14 before , but will not have fond memories			1
it came in the 2002 - 03 @entity13 group stages			1
they drew 1 - 1 at @entity57 but in the final group game , @entity14 raced into a 3 - 0 lead inside half an hour			1
@entity14 's striker @entity60 scores against @entity9 's goalkeeper @entity61 @entity9 stormed back with goals by @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity66 ’s late penalty rebound to level at 3 - 3 but it was not enough as @entity14 progressed by a point			1
@entity70 ’s team went into the @entity71 and were then knocked out by @entity72 in the quarter - finals			0
‘ hopefully he will have found everything i have ever said about the @entity9 players working with @entity22 to be helpful			2
i have only ever been honest			0
’ then there is the delicate issue of @entity17 , with @entity6 responding to criticism of the captain ’s form with a robust and forthright explanation of his role within this @entity9 team			1
@entity17 , who scored the last - minute winner against @entity86 , went on to have his say in last saturday ’s @entity89 derby at @entity57			1
he scored a peach of a goal , a free - kick from the edge of the area and then claimed ‘ people took it too far and say “ he ’s 34 , he ca n’t run and he ’s finished ”			2
’ spiky stuff , indeed			0
@entity9 needed a late penalty from @entity17 to beat @entity86 in their opening game @entity17 and @entity101 ( right ) are put through their paces during training @entity6 said : ‘ some of the criticism @entity106 is taking shows you the level he is playing that teams deem him to be man - marked			1
‘ as a footballer and a human being , as captain , every football person will know the qualities and influence he still has and he is a real catalyst for everything the team has done in the last 18 months			0
‘ it is something we are looking at as a club			0
he is still in a real good physical condition , 34 years old , never needs a day ’s rest , and this is a genuine superstar , a world - class player consistently for so many years			1
‘ he will play and prepare himself right the way through to the very end			0
when he still strikes a ball there are not many like him , both his passing and his shooting			0
it is something to respect and behold			0
@entity17 ( left ) curls in his free - kick against @entity29 and answers his critics @entity6 watches on after warning @entity9 will not take their @entity138 opponents lightly @entity140 used to winning - @entity6 ‘ the younger players look how calm @entity142 is and they know he has been at the level before and gone right the way through and won the tournament			1
they can draw inspiration from that			0
’ these days @entity17 is stationed just in front of the back four and he will be expected to dictate the tempo against @entity152 ’s side on wednesday evening			2
‘ he is right in the thick of it , he is right in the centre of it , that is the position i have put him in so that he can orchestrate the team			0
that is something he has done magnificently and the players respond to that , ’ added @entity6			2
@entity17 remains a valuable member of the @entity9 team , something @entity164 will do well to remember			1
he has been left behind with a diplomatic injury — code for axed — after he left @entity57 on saturday before a ball had been kicked in the @entity89 derby			0
has he been disciplined ? ‘ it ’s all in - house , ’ added @entity6 , which translated as a hefty fine for the @entity9 defender			1
as for the rest of this squad , @entity6 made it clear he is right behind them			2
@entity101 celebrates his goal against @entity86 in @entity9 's opening group game			1

@entity6 says criticism of @entity17 is *unfounded*
some say the @entity9 man is ' past it ' , based on this *season* 's showings
but @entity6 insists the 34 - year - old is still *hugely* influential
@entity6 : ' this is a genuine superstar , a world - class player consistently for so many years '
@entity9 are preparing to face @entity14 in the @entity13
