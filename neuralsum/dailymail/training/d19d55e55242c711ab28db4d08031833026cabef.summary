a man who once worked closely with beleaguered comedian @entity1 has come forward to detail how he once helped the star funnel thousands of dollars to a virtual harem of young women he kept during @entity6 's 8 - season run			1
@entity7 , 90 , told the @entity8 on sunday that he spent years as @entity10 's ' fixer ' for @entity1 -- as a conduit through whom the actor sent lady pals funds and as a guard at @entity1 's dressing room door when those women visited			1
' he had everybody fooled , ' said @entity7 , who says he eventually walked away from the star because of how he treated women			1
@entity10 employee speaks : a former @entity10 employee has come forward claiming he helped @entity1 funnel women to many women in the 1980s and 1900s			1
despite rumors of protests , @entity1 's @entity26 show went off without a hint of trouble on friday evening ( pictured ) the @entity10 veteran told the @entity8 , in a story published sunday , that @entity1 had a rotating lineup of young women brought to his @entity36 dressing room by a complicit modeling agency			1
@entity7 said the @entity40 agency 's owner would lead the girls there and leave once @entity1 picked his chosen lady			1
' she knew exactly what was going to go on , ' @entity7 told the @entity8			0
' then he 'd tell me , ' stand outside the door and do n't let anyone in			0
' now you put that together and figure ( out ) why			0
' according to @entity7 , some of the girls were as young as 16			2
@entity7 claims @entity1 would put women he especially liked up in apartments and give them up to $ 2,000 per month			1
after decades , @entity7 's even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave those women for @entity1			1
one of those women , @entity60 , had a daughter named @entity62 who would claim @entity1 was her father			1
dressing room visits : @entity64 in @entity36 was home to @entity6 for several seasons , it 's unclear if @entity7 's purported ' fixes ' happened there @entity69 days : @entity7 worked with @entity1 during the star 's time at @entity10 in the 1980s and 90s , when he starred on @entity6 ( pictured )			1
after decades , @entity7 's even saved receipts from money orders he says he gave women for @entity1 , though the money was moved in @entity7 's name , he says the money orders , though , are in @entity7 's name and not @entity1 's			1
' i did a lot of crazy things for him , ' @entity7 told the @entity8			0
' he was covering himself by having my name on it			0
' and when he did , @entity7 said he had to walk away			0
' you 've got all of these kids , every time , ' he told the @entity8			0
' i used to like him , but that 's the reason i quit him after so many years â€” because of the girls			0
' in recent weeks , at least seven women have publicly accused the 77 - year - old @entity1 of sexual assault years ago			2
@entity1 has not been charged in connection with any of the allegations			0
only one woman has filed suit - @entity97 , who sued in 2005 and settled for an undisclosed amount before the case went to trial			0
@entity1 's attorney , @entity101 , has criticized previous ' decades - old discredited allegations ' and denied some others			1
he suggested in a friday statement that @entity1 's accusers may have another agenda			2
' there has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich , powerful men , so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted			2
' models : model @entity123 , here in a file photo , is one of several women who claim they were raped by @entity1			2
@entity7 claims the actor once had a deal with a @entity40 modeling agency , who delivered young women to his dressing room door a statement issued friday by @entity1 's lawyer , @entity101 , in response to allegations of sexual assault against the comic : ' the new , never - before - heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated , fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30 , 40 , or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity			1
these brand new claims about alleged decades - old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous , and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing , done nothing , and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years			0
lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day			0
there has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich , powerful men , so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted			2
this situation is an unprecedented example of the media 's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards			0
over and over again , we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence , only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork			0
when will it end ? it is long past time for this media vilification of mr. @entity1 to stop			2

former @entity10 employee @entity7 , 90 , worked for @entity1 during the 1984 - 1992 run of the @entity6
he claims @entity1 funneled thousands of dollars to women during that time , like @entity60 , whose daughter claimed to be @entity1 's child
@entity7 says @entity1 had an agency bring a rotating line - up of young models to his dressing room -- some as young as 16
the @entity10 veteran says he finally walked away from the star because he felt sorry ' for the girls '
