by @entity0 published : 07:32 est , 11 august 2013 updated : 08:24 est , 12 august 2013 their motives were lofty , their methods inventive and their vessel ... as buoyant as their spirits			0
as a plan , however , crossing the @entity7 in a bouncy castle never exactly had success written all over it			1
these soldiers set themselves the challenge to paddle the mile from @entity13 , @entity14 , to @entity15 on the @entity16 in the @entity18 - themed inflatable in aid of @entity20			1
the intentions were there : soldiers had to be rescued after their attempt to paddle across the @entity7 in a bouncy castle failed to keep the vessel - aptly - named @entity28 - inflated , the group strapped petrol - fuelled leafblowers to her makeshift deck			1
a simple error over tide times saw captain @entity35 , captain @entity36 and major @entity37 being swept quickly towards the @entity39 and open sea , before a support boat had to tow them back to safety			1
the soldiers had planned to mount their challenge at high water when currents would be weakest			1
in order to keep it afloat the group had strapped the leafblowers to their makeshift deck			0
implausible : captain @entity36 , captain @entity35 and maj @entity37 after the attempt the brave but unwise attempt saw the officers get caught out by strong currents before they were swept out to sea high tide : their challenge was to paddle the 8ft @entity60 bouncy castle a mile across the @entity7 but they did n't launch until an hour later , by which point the tide was rushing in a westerly direction towards the @entity39			1
despite the failed attempt the soldiers refused to be deflated and told spectators they were already planning another attempt			1
@entity69 said : ' from the moment the soldiers got to the beach it was clear it was never going to work			2
' the soldiers decided to launch the bouncy castle way down the beach and tow it up to the starting point with their support boat but it broke down			2
despite the failed attempt the soldiers told spectators they were already planning another attempt deflated : captain @entity35 after the attempt which went wrong ' they then had to drag the fully inflated bouncy castle all the way up the shingle spit			1
' by the time they got to the end they had completely missed the slack tide , so despite a strong start it was n't long before they were flying towards the @entity39			2
' in the end they had to be rescued by their support boat and they ended up being towed back to the beach			0
' if it had n't been for the rescue who knows where they would be now			0
' they did say they were going to have another go so let 's hope they plan it better next time			0
' another bewildered onlooker said : ' they had clearly gone to a lot of bother to prepare the bouncy castle for sea , but it was just never going to work			2
' they would have been better off putting the leaf blowers in the water and blasting themselves across			0
' you would n't want to be in their tank , that 's for sure			0
it might make sense to leave these sorts of ventures to the navy			0

the army crew aimed to paddle the 8ft inflatable across the @entity7
stunt went wrong when they were swept out to sea by strong currents
captain @entity35 , captain @entity36 and major @entity37 said they will attempt to do it again
the soldiers were *raising* money for *charity* help for heroes
