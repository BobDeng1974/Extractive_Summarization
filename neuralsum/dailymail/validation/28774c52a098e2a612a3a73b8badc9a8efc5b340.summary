a country song with a theme as old as time has some listeners up in arms - and some radio stations now refusing to put it on the airwaves			1
@entity8 has a hit with their new tune @entity11 , selling an impressive 25,000 copies a week , a song about a girl who wants to get back her man			2
that girl though is not afraid to admit she is a little bit jealous of her former man 's new lady however , and some are now claiming the song ' promotes the gay agenda			2
i got a girl crush			0
' and for this , a simple tale of jealousy , some stations are saying they are getting just as much outrage from listeners as when the @entity52 criticized president @entity53 back in 2003			0
' is it frustrating to you that here is your song - that is one of the @entity60 sellers for weeks and weeks and weeks - and people on the radio are still afraid to play it because they think it ’s a lesbian song ? ' radio host @entity65 asked the group during a recent interview according to the @entity69			1
' just the fact that we ’re still discussing that , number one , there ’s so many problems with that whole issue , ' answered @entity34			0
bones , who hosts the most popular country radio morning show in the country then said ; ' it should n’t even matter if it ’s a lesbian song , is the first thing			1
' this is not the case for listeners however , with one individual in @entity85 writing in to say to a station after they played the song ; ' you are just promoting the gay agenda on your station and i am changing the channel and never listening to you ever again ! ! ' @entity94 , who hosts a morning show in @entity96 , @entity97 , says she got a similar response from some listeners			0
@entity100 ( left ) went through the same thing when her single @entity102 included a line about girls kissing girls , but @entity106 topped the pop charts with @entity108 ( right ) newcomer @entity100 dealt with the same problem from country radio when her song @entity102 , listed by some in the industry as one of the best songs of 2013 , was shunned as it included the lyrics ; ' kiss lots of boys / or kiss lots of girls / if that 's something you 're into			1
' despite selling over 500,000 copies , the song never charted higher than 43 of the @entity126 chart for country music radio airplay			0
this has never been a problem on the pop charts meanwhile , with @entity106 finding herself atop the @entity131 with her debut single @entity108			0
now , the group has actually filmed a spot that explains the song , with @entity34 saying ; ' it ’s about a girl saying , you know , " why do you love her and not me ? " ' the group did at least have their last song go to the top spot on the country charts and receive plenty of @entity146 .			1

the song @entity11 by @entity8 has been banned by some country stations after listeners complained it ' promotes the gay agenda '
this despite the fact that the song is about wanting back an ex , and just includes lyrics *detailing* the *attractiveness* his new girlfriend
the group has now filmed a spot explaining the video in hopes of *clarifying* that it is not a song about *homosexuality*
@entity65 , one of the most popular country radio hosts , recently said ; ' it should n’t even matter if it ’s a lesbian song , is the first thing '
country singer @entity100 went through the same thing when her single @entity102 included a line about girls kissing girls
@entity106 meanwhile topped the pop charts with her first single , i kissed a girl
