by @entity0 published : 08:07 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 08:17 est , 30 august 2012 held : @entity2 legal manager @entity1 who was arrested at his @entity5 home this morning the @entity2 's former legal adviser @entity1 has been arrested over alleged phone hacking			1
the 60 - year - old was held at his home in south west @entity5 this morning on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and is being questioned at a south @entity5 police station			2
a @entity12 spokesman said : ' the 60 - year - old man was arrested at his home address at approximately 6.45am , ' but refused to comment on whether or not the suspect was a journalist			1
mr @entity1 is the 25th person to be arrested under @entity16 , the @entity18 ’s investigation into allegations of phone hacking			1
the long - standing legal advisor , who left @entity23 last july , had maintained that phone hacking at the @entity25 was believed to have gone no further than a single ' rogue reporter ' during a 2009 meeting with the culture , media and sport select committee			0
but when @entity31 appeared before the @entity32 into press standards earlier this year , he appeared to suggest mr @entity1 was behind a cover - up at the company			1
mr @entity31 claimed a ' clever lawyer and drinking pal of the journalists ' had stopped employees from talking about the alleged hacking and had kept the truth from senior executives			2
mr @entity1 later hit back at the comments , issuing a statement that said : ' since @entity31 ’s evidence today about a lawyer who had been on the @entity48 for many years can only refer to me , i am issuing the following statement			1
' his assertion that i “ took charge of a cover - up ” in relation to phone - hacking is a shameful lie			0
the same applies to his assertions that i misinformed senior executives about what was going on and that i forbade people from reporting to @entity60 or to @entity61			0
cover - up : when @entity31 appeared before the @entity32 into press standards earlier this year , he appeared suggest mr @entity64 had been involved in a cover - up at the company ' it is perhaps no coincidence that the two people he has identified in relation to his cover - up allegations are the same two people who pointed out that his son ’s evidence to the @entity74 last year was inaccurate			2
' the fact that mr @entity31 ’s attack on @entity77 and myself may have been personal as well as being wholly wrong greatly demeans him			2
' former news international chief executive @entity60 is due to appear at @entity80 ’ @entity81 on monday over charges linked to @entity16			1
charges : former @entity23 chief executive @entity60 , left , is due to appear in court on monday over charges linked to @entity16 , while @entity85 ’s former spin doctor @entity84 , right , appeared in court earlier this month she is accused of one general charge of conspiracy to illegally access voicemails , and two others relating to murdered schoolgirl @entity91 and former union boss @entity93			1
seven other people including @entity85 ’s former spin doctor @entity84 appeared at the same court earlier this month to face phone hacking charges			0
the group included six members of staff from the now - defunct tabloid the @entity48 ( @entity25 ) , who all face the general charge alongside @entity102 , as well as specific counts linked to individual people			0
former @entity25 editor @entity84 is accused , along with ex-managing editor @entity105 , former news editor @entity106 , former head of news @entity107 , ex-chief reporter @entity109 and former reporter @entity110			0
private investigator @entity111 has also been charged			0
