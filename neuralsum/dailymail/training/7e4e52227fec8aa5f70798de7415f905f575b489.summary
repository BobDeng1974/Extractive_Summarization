when @entity1 discovered her daughter was being bullied , she vowed to move her to the £ 12,000 - a - year school down the road			1
but unable to afford the fees , the housewife sat down at her kitchen table and wrote a list of ten ways to raise money			1
halfway down the list she wrote ‘ selling traditional leather satchels ’			1
it was a business venture which , just four years later , would generate an annual turnover of more than £ 12million			1
it is sold in shops including @entity29 , while @entity30 ’s in @entity31 described it as ‘ the @entity32 it bag ’			0
most surreal of all , however , was when mrs @entity1 was this week named in the @entity36 list of the 100 most influential people in fashion – alongside the @entity39 and @entity40			1
‘ how weird is that ? ’ the 45 - year - old said			2
‘ it is completely amazing			0
it is times like that when i think , “ @entity48 , look how much farther we have come than we ever set out to ”			0
’ the company now makes 900 bags a day and still has a backlog of orders			2
star fans : the satchels have many fans among the fashion crowd including actress @entity58 ( pictured left ) and radio presenter @entity59 ( pictured right ) model customer : @entity26 is also a fan and is pictured with a blue number from the range as the firm ’s first shop opened in @entity23 at the weekend , it is hard to believe that the multi-million - pound business began as a solution to pay private school fees			1
in 2008 , mrs @entity1 and her husband @entity70 discovered their daughter @entity71 , now 13 , had been thrown to the ground and kicked by bullies			1
she said : ‘ @entity71 was eight when it became really apparent that she was being badly bullied by a group of girls			2
i told her , “ you will not go back to that school next year			2
we will find you a new one and you will be so happy			0
” i had promised my child i would deliver and i could n’t let her down			0
it was the trigger for me to start my own business			0
’ by chance , @entity71 and her younger brother @entity87 , now 11 , were reading @entity88 at the time and had asked their mother for leather satchels similar to those worn by the book ’s characters			2
starting small , she found a leather supplier in @entity97 and asked him to make her eight chestnut brown satchels			2
popular : the company now makes 900 bags a day and still has a backlog of orders @entity103 started slowly and she sold just one a week at first			1
but , determined to make it work , she left leaflets in doctors ’ surgeries and school receptions , and taught herself to design a website			2
she said : ‘ i chose satchels because i had always loved mine as a child			0
it lasted me all the way through school , whereas my children ’s rucksacks became tatty and dirty within a few months			0
’ the @entity121 graduate had been enjoying life as a full - time mother while her husband , a partner at an engineering consultancy firm , was the breadwinner			0
but she immersed herself in books on how to run a business and quickly found herself working all hours of the day from the kitchen of the family home near @entity131 to keep up with demand			0
when it became clear the satchels were not being bought by mothers but by the fashion crowd , she began experimenting with colours , initially adding red and green to the collection			0
bright idea : mrs @entity1 first thought about satchels when her children were reading @entity88 and asked her for some similar to the ones worn by the characters in the book within a year she was selling to high street chain @entity147 and the satchels , which range in price from £ 80 to £ 130 , were championed by fashion bloggers			1
the business now employs 84 staff and has its own factory in @entity154			1
when asked if she always had a passion for fashion , she exclaims : ‘ no , no , no. any photos of me in the 1980s are evidence of that			0
’ she says the greatest reward of her venture has been fulfilling her promise to her daughter			0
‘ my daughter is so happy at her school			1
my proudest moment was when we went to get her school uniform from @entity169 a few weeks after i started the business			1

@entity1 discovered her daughter was being bullied at school and vowed to send her to a private one down the road
