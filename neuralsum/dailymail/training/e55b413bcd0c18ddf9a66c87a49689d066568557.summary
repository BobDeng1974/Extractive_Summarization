by @entity0 published : 06:22 est , 14 march 2013 updated : 10:30 est , 15 march 2013 these are the first stunning pictures of @entity2 as it became visible above the @entity4 for the first time last night			1
@entity6 managed to capture comet c / 2011 @entity7 in almost clear skies above the @entity9 as it graced the western horizon trailing a blaze of fire			1
the pictures were taken over from near @entity14 , @entity15 , and at @entity16 in the nearby seaside village of @entity18			2
' it 's one of the first glimpses we 've had in the @entity4 due to cloud cover but there was a fantastic sunset and beautiful clear skies			1
' it was really difficult to spot at first , with it being in the same part of the sky as the setting @entity43 , but once darkness set in , it was there in all its glory , beneath the crescent moon			1
' it 's very difficult to see with the naked eye , but with binoculars or a dslr camera you should n't have a problem and it 's due to be in the western skies for the next few weeks			2
' @entity7 has already been visible to observers in the southern hemisphere for some weeks , but appeared in northern skies for the first time in the past few days			1
yesterday @entity60 published pictures of the comet blazing a trail through the skies over @entity65 and southern @entity66 and , in coming weeks , observers at ever higher latitudes will have a chance to see it			1
currently a mere 93million miles away , it is now heading away from our solar system and is not expect to return for another 100,000 years			2
however , it will be visible in the northern hemisphere for the next few weeks , just after sunset in the west			1
just dropping by : currently a mere 93million miles away , the comet is now heading away from our solar system and is not expect to return for another 100,000 years to find @entity7 in @entity4 skies , stargazers will need a clear sky , ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon , according to the @entity86			1
after sunset the comet will appear as a misty patch not far from the @entity90 , low down in the western sky			2
searching for @entity7 through binoculars is recommended , and it will help to see the tails which should be pointing upwards from the horizon			2
it will be visible for the next couple of weeks , but as the nights pass the comet will move away from the @entity43 and fade and light from the @entity99 will interfere more			1
@entity7 ' name is an acronym for the @entity103 telescope used to spot it two years ago - the @entity104			0
the volcano - top telescope is on constant prowl for dangerous asteroids and comets that might be headed our way			0
- and in recent months there have been several			0
like other comets of its type , @entity7 is thought to have originated in the @entity114 , a vast region containing millions of comets located more than two light years from the @entity43 @entity7 travelled in towards the inner solar system for millions of years , dormant for most of this time as a small nucleus made up of rock and ices			0
when comets approach the @entity43 , these ices heat up , eventually turning to gases that jet out into space together with dusty material to form a head or coma around the cometary nucleus			0
particles from the @entity43 ( the so - called solar wind ) blow the gases back in a straight tail , whilst sunlight exerts a pressure on the dust particles to create a curved tail			0
spot the comet : to find it in @entity4 skies , stargazers will need a clear sky , ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon , according to the @entity86 to find it in @entity4 skies , stargazers will need a clear sky , ideally be away from the lights of towns and cities and have a good western horizon , according to the @entity86			1
' after sunset the comet will be low down in the west and appear as a misty patch not far from the @entity90 , ' an @entity86 spokesman said			0
' using binoculars will make it easier to find and will certainly help identify the tails which should point up from the horizon			0
' as the days pass , the comet will move away from the @entity43 and fade and light from the @entity99 will interfere more			0
' at the same time however , @entity2 will be higher up , will be visible later in the night and so be seen in a darker sky			1
' after its brief period of visibility , the comet will travel back out towards the depths of space where it will be only be detected by large telescopes			0
' travelling north : @entity7 seen from @entity170 next to the waxing crescent moon off the western coast of southern @entity66 the comet @entity7 , above and to the right , passes over the @entity174 , @entity65 : observers in southern @entity177 states have already been able to see it for several days @entity2 is the first of two comets which will appear in the night sky this year in the @entity4			1
later this year , in november and december , @entity181 is expected to be one of the brightest comets ever seen and experts believe it will be brighter than the moon in the night sky			2
and next year astronomers are anticipating potential cosmic fireworks after they identified a comet hurtling into our solar system that could hit @entity193 with potentially catastrophic force			0
according to current calculations , comet @entity196 ( @entity195 ) is set for a near miss that will bring it within 23,000 miles of the surface of the @entity193			0
but the unpredictable nature of comet orbits , which can change as jet - like geysers of steam erupt from their surfaces as they near the @entity43 , means it could pass further away , or veer into a direct collision course .			0

@entity2 seen over the @entity9 from the @entity213 coast
it has been visible in the southern hemisphere for weeks already
the *infrequent* visitor will be in @entity4 skies for a couple of weeks
experts recommend searching close to the crescent moon at dusk
