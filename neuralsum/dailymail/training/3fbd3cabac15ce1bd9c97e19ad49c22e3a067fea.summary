when @entity2 the chihuahua - dachshund cross was born , he looked the same as his two siblings			1
but while they grew up and were sold off to new owners , he stayed the same size , measuring just over five inches tall			1
now dog breeder @entity8 , 24 , has adopted him as her own and takes him for walks on a lead designed for budgies			1
at just under 2lb , the petite pet weighs less than a bag of sugar , and is dwarfed by even everyday items such as a tin of hot dogs			1
she now walks him using a lead designed for a budgie ( right ) @entity8 said : ' he 's brilliant and he 's tiny			1
there were two others in his litter but while they grew he 's just stayed the same size at around three inches tall to the shoulder			2
' he was so cute i just could n't bring myself to sell him so he 's stayed with us			2
he gets on with all the other dogs , he 's very brave and loves his food and playing with a tennis ball			0
' his mum is a dachshund and his dad a @entity43 - neither of them are particularly small			0
' he eats plenty of scrambled eggs and pasta so we do n't know why he 's stayed so small			0
he 's a fantastic dog with a big personality			2
' he 's a definite @entity52 - totally laid back and ready to do anything you want			0
he 's incredibly sociable and loves meeting other dogs			0
' @entity8 says @entity56 loves food , including scrambled eggs and pasta , and can not understand why he has n't grown @entity56 lives with seven other dogs - @entity60 , a rescue greyhound , @entity62 , a border collie , @entity64 the cardigan corgi and four other sausage dogs called @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
three - month - old @entity56 lives with dog rescuer @entity8 and partner @entity72 , 45 , a lorry driver , as well as seven other hounds in @entity75 , derbys			1
@entity8 added : ' @entity56 can be reluctant on walks - because of his size everything is a bit daunting to him			1
small blades of grass for him must just seem massive			0
' we have to take him out on a cockatiel lead called a feather tether which is supposed to be used for budgies			0
' i 've also fashioned him a little t - shirt out of a sleeve to act as a harness for him			0
' luckily he 's not got stuck anywhere or been accidentally trodden on yet , but we have baby gates for the dogs which he manages to squeeze through and we worry he 'll get lodged between the bars			0
" @entity8 says @entity56 has already become a local favourite because of his size and personality			1
she said : ' everyone in the village loves him			0
everywhere we go people stop us to take pictures of him and ask why he 's so small			2
@entity8 says people are amazed by how small @entity2 is , being not much longer than a hot dog , as this bun shows @entity8 said @entity56 has not encountered any problems because of his size yet , but fears he may get stuck somewhere or squashed by someone not paying attention @entity8 says one man offered to buy @entity2 while she was out walking him but she rejected the offer ' i think people find him a bit of a novelty especially because he 's a sausage dog			1
one man even came up to me once asking how much he was - i had to tell him my dogs are n't for sale			0
" @entity8 and @entity72 also look after seven other dogs - @entity60 , a rescue greyhound , border collie @entity62 , @entity64 the cardigan corgi and four other sausage dogs called @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
the dog - lover added : ' dachshunds are great pets - i love them because of their chilled out temperament and they 're so loving			2
' i 'm a stay - at - home mum to the dogs but i rescue dachshunds in my spare time and make sure they 're re-homed to loving owners			0
