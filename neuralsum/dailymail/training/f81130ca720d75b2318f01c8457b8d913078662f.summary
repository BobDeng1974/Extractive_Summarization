rent in @entity1 is so high that one young professional has worked out it would be cheaper live in @entity4 and fly to work			1
@entity7 manager @entity6 , 30 , wanted a less expensive way of travelling to his office near @entity10			0
what he found was an unlikely solution : it would be more cost effective to relocate to the sun - kissed coast of north east @entity18 , more than 700 miles away			2
cheap alternative : mr @entity6 found the lack of council tax charges and low rent in @entity4 , above , meant it is cheaper to live there and fly to @entity1 expensive : @entity1 's council tax charges make the city more expensive than alternatives in @entity28 , mr @entity6 found mr @entity6 said that a combination of cheap rent , travel and the lack of council tax charges in the @entity18 city would more than undercut the high prices of travel cards living costs in the @entity39 capital			1
he arrived at the extraordinary solution by doing sums based on property and travel websites			0
@entity1 : one bed flat , @entity45 - £ 1,505 council tax - £ 75 zone 1 - 2 travel card - £ 116.60 total : £ 1,697 per month			1
@entity4 : three bed flat , @entity49 , £ 580 council tax - £ 0 @entity51 flight , metro - £ 778 total : £ 1,358 per month a one - bedroom flat in @entity45 would cost around £ 1,505 , according to @entity54			0
he then added in council tax at approximately £ 75 and a zone 1 - 2 travelcard to get to his job in the @entity60 , which costs £ 116.80 , making a total of £ 1,697			2
mr @entity6 said : ' i chose @entity45 because i know and like the area , and it does n’t seem a stretch to suggest that a young professional may afford to live there ' he then compared the prices to @entity4 where a three - bedroom flat , with three balconies , a stone ’s throw away from the metro , in the ' nice and safe ' area of @entity49 which costs £ 580 per month			1
mr @entity6 added , ' i used to live there , and being a fairly upmarket residential district , it ’s a very decent and fair comparison to @entity45			0
' there are , of course , cheaper flats , but i was trying to compare apples with apples – even in spite of the three bedrooms			0
' with rent obviously cheaper , mr @entity6 then considered travel			2
he found that he could fly back and forth from @entity4 to @entity86 via @entity51 nearly every day in november for £ 29 a trip			2
jet set : he discovered that a four day commute using @entity51 flights to get into @entity1 from @entity18 would work cut the cost of living by £ 339 per - month he added £ 5 to get to from @entity4 ’s @entity4 airport and a £ 14 return to @entity10 , making £ 19 in total on land travel each day			1
that ’s fixed commuting costs of £ 48 a day , 4 days a week , for 4 weeks a month , which worked out at £ 778 add on rent of £ 580 a month and the cost of living in @entity4 and commuting to @entity1 comes to £ 1,358 a month			1
that ’s £ 339 less than the cost of living in @entity1 and commuting from @entity101			1
add that to the fact that he could live in a sunny city by the sea , and mr @entity6 said his findings were ' beyond crazy '			0
he said : ' i could walk to my desk by 9:30am , with time for a @entity111 coffee and bacon and cheese croissant en route ' ' it 's just beyond crazy , and completely unsustainable '			0
too much : mr @entity6 was forced into looking for alternatives after he became sick of the sky high rent prices for relatively small accommodation in north and west @entity1 pricey journey : he based his sums around a commute from @entity45 to @entity10 , above , and a similar trip from @entity4 ' i feel like it 's reaching a tipping point			1
i 've been discussing with friends this week , and several of us have said that we 're going to have to consider leaving @entity1			0
the sums just do n't add up ' the only concession he had to make was that he could work from home for one day a week with flights of a weekend being far more pricey			0
he said : ' i thought at least it would require some poetic licence or dodgy sums ' but the only assumption i ’m making is that i work a four - day week in @entity1 , with a day at home ( i.e. @entity4 )			2

@entity6 did the sums after becoming sick of rent prices in @entity1
he found it would be cheaper live in @entity18 and fly to his job in the @entity60
a four day commute from @entity28 worked out at £ 339 per - month cheaper
