by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:17 est , 22 june 2013 updated : 18:17 est , 22 june 2013 free choice : @entity3 leader @entity3 has said people should be able to choose their own solicitor a cabinet split over plans to cut legal aid deepened last night as deputy prime minister @entity3 signalled his concerns for the first time			1
the @entity3 leader said it was ‘ perverse ’ to stop people choosing their own solicitor and claimed small high street law firms would suffer – rather than the ‘ fat cat qcs ’ targeted by justice secretary @entity14			1
asked about the reforms by lawyer and @entity3 activist @entity18 in @entity19 yesterday , mr @entity3 said : ‘ you could say it ’s perverse that a government with conservatives in it is reducing public choice rather than increasing it			2
‘ the only straitjacket on all of this is the need to yield about £ 220 million of savings in legal aid in criminal cases			0
‘ but on the back of the consultation we should see if there are alternative , less disruptive , less unpopular ways of delivering that			0
’ the comments come after the conservative attorney - general came out on the side of lawyers who are angry at the changes			1
@entity43 said he could do little about the plan – because ‘ policy in this area is owned by the lord chancellor , and not me ’			0
but he promised he would ‘ endeavour to ensure , as far as i can , that the decision he reaches in due course is a fully informed one ’			0
mr @entity14 ’s plans threaten three - quarters of the @entity55 ’s 1,600 solicitors ’ firms and could cost an estimated 10,000 jobs – as multi-million - pound contracts would be handed to firms offering the cheapest bid			1
the @entity62 split has deepened even further with attacks by influential @entity62 backbenchers @entity65 and @entity66			0
pressing ahead : justice secretary @entity14 's plans could cost an estimated 10,000 jobs mr @entity66 said that under the changes many recent high - profile cases that the government lost would never have been fought – including the @entity72 and the @entity74 interpreters who won the right to settle in @entity55			1
mr @entity14 ’s proposals mean the only way such cases could be taken up would be if the lawyers who were suing the government worked for free			2
the reason is a proposed residence test – under which no one , @entity55 citizens included , can apply for civil legal aid unless they live in the @entity55 .			0
