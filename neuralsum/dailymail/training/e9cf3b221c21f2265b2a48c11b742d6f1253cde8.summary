the couple , who met in @entity24 , reportedly wed in a ceremony in @entity27 's @entity26 in front of around 180 guests , including actress @entity30 and performer @entity31			0
earlier this month , the @entity1 formally added gay marriage cases to the justices ' agenda for their closed - door conference on september 29			1
