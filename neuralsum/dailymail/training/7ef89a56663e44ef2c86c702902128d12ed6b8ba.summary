she explains that the car has done 150,000 kilometers and has a new timing belt which means that ' there is sufficient mileage here to support a realistic appraisal of the status of women , but still plenty in reserve to ' keep going ' , as @entity61 once said to @entity62			0
' advising that the car ' would suit [ a ] feminist ' , ms @entity10 highlights several features of the car which would empower men or women interested in gender equality ms @entity10 says in the ad that she bought the car , which shows ' demonstrable continuity , so no need to worry excessively about generations , waves , or postfeminism ' her recommended mechanic @entity26 wo n't patronize women who employ his services , or ' mansplain ' , a term meaning men who offer opinions on topics they know little about			1
' manual controls and power steering are also beneficial for the modern feminist driver , as the features would allow the prospective buyer to ' empower [ themselves ] by retaining full control over [ their ] decisions on the road to equality ' , and would ensure they could ' rise above essentialist arguments about women 's physical limitations			1
' it would come as a given that ms @entity10 would have a special interest in feminism , given that she is a lecturer in gender studies and @entity93			1
' i guess i know that world well , and so was able to write to it			0
it 's a really hard market at the moment , and i do really want to sell it , ' she said			0

' it ’s a popular culture feminist word used to describe the experience of having a man explain something to you that you already know , or even know more about than him , ' ms @entity10 explained			2
' it can also mean that a man offers an opinion on something he does n’t know much about , ' she said			0
' a lot of the time they are just responding to societal expectations , but it can be problematic in workplaces , as cultural habits can often silence women and perpetuate bad patterns			0
' her mechanic is also close to the @entity137 , so prospective buyers of the car ' can read @entity140 in the library while he works '			0
ms @entity10 said that @entity142 was always very sensible and straight - talking , spoke to her like an equal , and was just a very good mechanic			2
