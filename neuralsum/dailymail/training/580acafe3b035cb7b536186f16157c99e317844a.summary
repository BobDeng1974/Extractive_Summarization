@entity0 has jokingly blamed the photographer for the picture of @entity3 that gave the impression he was unhappy signing for @entity5 on loan			1
the picture , taken by external photographer @entity8 but released by the club , became an internet sensation with mp @entity11 - an @entity5 fan - remarking on @entity13 that the @entity15 winger appeared distinctly unimpressed with his new place of work			1
@entity3 , having arrived from @entity18 , then had to insist on the same medium that he was happy			1
@entity3 looks glum as he is presented as an @entity5 player after signing on loan from @entity18 @entity0 quipped that it was the photographer 's job to make @entity3 smile for the pictures @entity3 took to @entity13 to poke fun at the pictures and insist that he is ' buzzing ' to be at @entity5 ' he is very happy - i would blame the photographer because it is their job to make him produce a nice smile ! ' joked @entity0			1
' but i saw a different face - a focused face , of someone who is ready to train and to perform			0
' it has been great to see the way @entity36 has adjusted , because when you sign a player in january , it is very difficult to find someone who is up to speed with the league and their match fitness			0
' he is fully fit and ready to make an impact as part of the squad for the weekend			2
' we are delighted , and i know there has been a lot said about the pictures - i will chase the photographer because i was n't happy with that at all ! ' @entity3 grins as he chats with club legend and current coach @entity54 in training at @entity55 @entity0 has confirmed that @entity3 is in his squad to face rivals @entity57 on saturday @entity0 , pictured on the touchline at @entity60 last weekend , is delighted with the signing of @entity3 meanwhile , @entity0 has dismissed talk of @entity63 suffering another injury setback and stressed he expects the midfielder to be available for saturday 's @entity67 derby against rivals @entity57			1
it was believed @entity63 , who has only played twice since november due to his hamstring issue and last featured in late december , had aggravated the problem in training , ruling him out of this weekend 's game			2
but asked about that at his press conference on thursday to preview the clash at @entity78 , @entity0 said : ' no , he has n't suffered a setback			1
' he was in hospital yesterday having a scan to make sure he is fully recovered and the scan showed he is perfectly healed			2
@entity63 ( left ) , pictured against @entity83 , is expected to be fit for saturday 's @entity67 derby @entity63 ( left ) , pictured against @entity57 in september , has been struggling with hamstring problems ' now it is just a matter of adapting him into the match intensity , and i expect @entity63 to be available for the squad at the weekend , so it is terrific news in that respect			0
' there was more good news on goalkeeper @entity97 , who is back in training after a calf problem but will not be fit to face @entity57			0
@entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 are still ruled out through injury			0
@entity0 added : ' @entity97 is training now and it will be important to make the right decision			1
he feels strong and ready but medical advice says probably another week to make sure he 's fully healed and we do n't take any @entity108 ' any soft tissue injury you have to be wary but it 's incredible how quick he 's back in training			2
we will assess him and see but it looks like another week			0
' @entity5 goalkeeper @entity97 is back in training but will not be fit to play against @entity57 this weekend @entity116 has stepped up to replace @entity97 and has improved in recent weeks after a difficult start in defeats by @entity119 and @entity120 ' it 's been great to see the support @entity116 has received from everyone and i think we have seen him becoming someone who can enjoy that role , ' said @entity0			1
' as a keeper that 's important , such a specific , black and white position			0
it was great to see him perform like he did against @entity133 , keeping a clean sheet			0
