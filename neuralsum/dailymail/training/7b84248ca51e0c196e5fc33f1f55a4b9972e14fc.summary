@entity1 is backing @entity2 to become the next @entity4 leader , it was claimed today			1
the former prime minister is said to think the shadow business secretary is the ' natural heir ' to his new @entity4 project			1
it comes after he took an apparent swipe at @entity11 , complaining that too few of today 's party leaders have experience of life outside politics			2
several potential successors are already said to be jockeying for position			0
shadow home secretary @entity25 and health spokesman @entity26 are seen as frontrunners			2
but bookies have mr @entity2 at 6/1 to become the next @entity4 leader			1
he has repeatedly insisted he is loyal to mr @entity11 , but is seen as certain to enter a leadership race in the future			0
he speaks to mr @entity1 often , and is in regular contact with other @entity4 veterans , including @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 , the @entity37 reported			2
a friend told the newspaper that mr @entity1 sees mr @entity2 as a ' natural heir ' to his new @entity4 legacy			1
in particular , mr @entity2 has been outspoken in defence of immigration and has repeatedly criticised @entity44			1
the stance has ' drawn further admiration from mr @entity1 who is in total agreement ' , according to the source			0
mr @entity2 returned to his attack on @entity44 today , accusing @entity51 's party of a ' fundamental con '			1
mr @entity2 stepped up his attacks on @entity44 again today with an appearance on the @entity55 he told @entity58 's @entity57 show : ' i think we 've got to be very clear : i want a firm and a fair immigration policy and i think it 's very important that we have control but i do n't think ' othering ' people and blaming people over there , at the moment eastern @entity68 , is the way to go			1
' i actually think that is a fundamental con and it lets politicians of all political persuasion who have n't done the things they should have done over the decades , off the hook			1
i do n't think it 's in keeping with our @entity79 values and i wo n't have any truck with them			0
' last week mr @entity1 appeared to criticise politicians , like mr @entity11 , who have spent their entire careers in @entity85			0
the three - times election winner said the ' gene pool ' of political leaders had suffered because too few candidates have ' real - life experience '			2
