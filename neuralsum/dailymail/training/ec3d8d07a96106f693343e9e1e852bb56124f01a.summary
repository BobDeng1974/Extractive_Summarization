by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:26 est , 9 may 2013 updated : 06:08 est , 10 may 2013 @entity3 is hotly tipped as the future of computing , but initial images of what users can see have been distinctly underwhelming and failed to translate the interactive experience of what the technology can really do			1
but now a new first - person video has surfaced which finally gives those of us who have not yet had an opportunity to get our hands on the tech toy a look at what you actually see from behind the glass			1
‘ i can explain @entity3 to you all day and tell you what you 'll see when you look through it , ’ says tech expert @entity22			1
@entity22 , who writes for @entity38 - related review site @entity36 , and a friend then fix the headset to a camera which enables the viewer to get a better idea of how the glasses actually work			1
he shows the device doing a broad range of tasks including getting directions , recording video , converting currency and having a @entity59 with a friend where they can see and hear each other			1
the glasses look impressive but these are rather basic tasks that any smartphone can do , although @entity22 predicts bigger and better functionality once the device is commercially available next year and third party developers start creating different applications			2
the device 's screen features a list of options which the user can choose between @entity3 can be used to record video @entity78 's @entity77 wearable computer is set to go on sale to the public next year - but a growing number of complaints could see it banned in hundreds of public places by the time it launches			1
legal experts are warning of a massive ' legal brawl ' over the gadget			2
already users wearing @entity3 eyewear have been told they are banned from strip clubs , cinemas and casinos because their owners do n’t want them filming there			1
in @entity96 legislators tried to make it illegal to use the gadget while driving - and plan to launch another legal attack before it becomes widely available next year			1
' this is just the beginning , ' @entity99 , a @entity100 lawyer specializing in privacy issues , told the @entity103			2
' @entity3 is going to cause quite a brawl			1
' @entity78 co-founder @entity105 wearing @entity3 , the firm 's wearable computer			1
today it was revealed establishments such as cinemas , banks , parks and even strip clubs are planning to ban them amid privacy fears early ' explorer ' versions are being sold for £ 1,000 ( $ 1,500 ) , although consumer versions are expected to be significantly cheaper			2
@entity119 , an analyst firm , estimates that wearable technology and another major initiative , self - driving cars , could ultimately be a $ 500 billion opportunity for the company			1
in the shorter term , @entity125 , a forecasting firm , estimates that shipments of smart glasses , could be as high as $ 6.6 million in three years			2
the @entity129 , a @entity131 dive bar , was the first to explicitly ban @entity3 , launching a campaign to warn customers months before the gadget was available			1
many saw it as a publicity stunt - but dozens of places have now followed			1
experts say the gadget could challenge privacy laws around the world			2
' @entity3 will test the right to privacy versus the @entity144 , ' said @entity145 , a social media expert at @entity147			1
@entity148 , director of @entity150 privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity151 , said : ' the implications of them being controlled by an unknown third party would make phone hacking look like a minor blip			0
@entity158 , a pioneer of wearable computing who is a technical adviser to the @entity3 team , said he and colleagues had experimented with glass - type devices for years , ' and i ca n’t think of a single instance where something bad has happened			1
' however , @entity169 computer engineering professor and wearable computer pioneer @entity168 was at a @entity172 ’s restaurant in @entity173 last when he claims an employee tried to physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head			0
assault : the three men , one wearing a @entity180 's shirt , another with a @entity172 's name tag , not visible , demanded to know why dr @entity168 had the glasses @entity78 has tried to play down the controversy			2
' we ’re acutely aware of those questions , ' @entity184 responded to similar concerns raised at @entity188 over the device 's abilities being so new			0
' we want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... but i ’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear , as opposed to understanding what ’s possible			0
' the people who ’ve used @entity3 , including myself , report it as remarkable			1
i ’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways , ' @entity184 said			0
nerds ! in a @entity206 gallery titled , @entity77 , photos are uploaded showing current users of the device to wide poking and name calling , one such photo pictured @entity3 offers a uniquely detailed view of your life and your surroundings and while @entity78 ’s main interest is selling advertising , there are a whole range of reasons why other people might seek to do all they can to get access to a device			1
' the only way to protect yourself and the people around you is to not wear them			0
' @entity78 says that @entity3 is a work in progress , with test versions now being released to 2,000 developers			1
another 8,000 ' explorers , ' people handpicked by @entity78 , will soon get a pair after winning an online contest			0
@entity78 admits the technology is still facing issues			0
- @entity78 chairman @entity184 ' we are thinking very carefully about how we design @entity3 because new technology always raises new issues , ' said @entity242 , a @entity78 spokeswoman			1
however , the firm has also encouraged developers to experiment with the device - and at its developer conference in @entity247 next week is holding sessions dedicated to ' @entity249 '			2
' our goal is to make the world better , ' @entity78 chairman @entity184 said of the device at @entity188 last week			0
' we ’ll take the criticism along the way , but criticisms are inevitably from people who are afraid of change or who have not figured out that there will be an adaptation of society to it , ' he said			0
' we want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... but i ’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear , as opposed to understanding what ’s possible			0
' the people who ’ve used @entity3 , including myself , report it as remarkable			1
i ’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways , ' @entity184 said			0
business owners have been unimpressed			0
@entity276 , managing partner of @entity277 in @entity278 , said that patrons will be asked to check the eyewear when they come in			0
he said : ‘ we 've been dealing with the cellphone videoing and the picture taking over the years and we are quick to make sure that that does n't happen in the club			0
‘ as the sale of ( @entity3 ) spreads , there 'll be more people using them and wanting to use them at places such as a gentlemen 's club			1
‘ if we see those in the club , we would do the same thing that we do to people who bring cameras into the club			0
@entity78 has released a series of images showing off the glasses being used to capture video the glasses will also be able to take part in live video chats ‘ if they do n't want to check it , we 'd be happy to give them a limo ride back to their hotel ’			1
a spokesman for @entity312 resorts , which owns the @entity313 in @entity278 , said that picture - taking was ‘ frowned upon ’ inside its properties			2
he said : ‘ security officers on duty ask individuals not to take pictures for the privacy of others in the casino			0
‘ this new product is nothing new in terms of a challenge for us , because for so many years , the very tiniest of portable lipstick and pinpoint cameras have been around			0
’ @entity330 , one of the largest cinema chains in the @entity333 , added that no recording devices were permitted into its cinemas			0
the @entity336 is one of the first to ban @entity3 with a quiet wink of an eye @entity3 users will now be able to take a picture thanks to one of many new apps released and currently in development for the device			1
snap ! a new app for @entity3 called @entity345 allows users to take pictures with the blink of an eye ordinarily @entity3 users must deliver an audible command of , ' ok , @entity3 , take a picture , ' to kick in the camera 's software			1
however with its release this week program @entity355 will additionally give users the option of silently ordering the command			2
' you might not think it 's hard to say " ok , @entity363 " or even just tap a button			0
but it 's a context switch that takes you out of the moment , even if just for a second , ' @entity355 's developer @entity365 from @entity366 explained on his @entity59 page on wednesday			0
' i 've taken more pictures today than i have the past 5 days thanks to this , ' he continued			0
' sure , they are mostly silly , but my timeline has now truly become a timeline of where i 've been			0
' however while pirating images of subjects in public may be one use for the device , speaking like one will not be allowed , as @entity383 has revealed			2
@entity78 's voice translation technology censors curse words , prohibiting its user from for instance sending a voice - written email containing an explicative			2
currently there is said to be no way to disable to filter , which would work similar to @entity78 's @entity393 option , the website reports .			0

a first - person video has been released showing the types of images and functions that users can use when wearing @entity3
