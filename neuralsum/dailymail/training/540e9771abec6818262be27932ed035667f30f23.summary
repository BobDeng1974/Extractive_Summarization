@entity6 , 23 months , died after being given a last fatal , adult - sized dose of the drug by his heroin - using father @entity9 , 33			1
@entity9 and @entity6 's mother @entity10 , 35 , did not discover his body until at least five hours later because they were groggy and hungover after binging on vodka and drugs			1
tragic : toddler @entity6 , pictured with his mother @entity10 , died after his addict parents gave him the heroin substitute methadone both had deliberately given little @entity6 the liquid for up to eight months before his death - which was caused either by one fatal dose or a build - up of methadone in his system			1
police found a small measuring cup with traces of methadone on it , which the parents used to administer doses to @entity6 when he was ' grisly '			1
@entity9 was jailed for nine years today at @entity31 , after a jury of six women and six men unanimously found he had administered the fatal and previous doses and was guilty of manslaughter			1
crack cocaine and heroin addict @entity37 was cleared of manslaughter but jailed for four years after the jury convicted her of allowing a child to die and administering methadone to her son			1
both parents wept in the dock as the verdicts were returned - with @entity9 telling jurors ' you 're wrong ' as they left the court			2
jailing @entity9 , @entity52 mr justice @entity51 told him : ' there were times when @entity6 's needs were simply too much for you			2
@entity6 had to be pacified , quickly and efficiently			0
' the answer was to feed him a dribble of methadone to send him peacefully to sleep so that you could have the rest and tranquillity that you wanted			2
jailed : father @entity9 was handed a nine - month jail term after a jury unanimously found him guilty of manslaughter punished : the @entity52 mr justice @entity51 told @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 ( right ) they would suffer ' a prolonged anguish ' for failing to protect their infant son ' @entity6 was crying and miserable , he simply would not settle down			1
you reverted to the remedy that had , on other occasions , been the quick solution			0
' only you know whether the methadone was fed in one amount or had been drip fed over a period of time that day to the point where @entity6 's small body could no longer give resistance and he died			2
' you will suffer a prolonged anguish larger than any prison sentence could impose for what you did to @entity6			0
' the judge also addressed @entity37 as he jailed her for four years , saying : ' you were his mother and you knew what was happening			1
' you were a loving and devoted mother and you will have a prolonged anguish for failing to protect your small boy			0
' the three - week trial jury heard that tests on @entity6 found quantities of the drug at a similar level to an adult on a methadone programme - suggesting ' repeated exposure ' over a ' long period of time '			1
the toddler had filthy legs , a soiled nappy and methadone stains on his vest when he was discovered dead on his parents bed in their squalid and cramped one - bedroom flat in @entity31			1
both of his parents , from @entity31 , told police @entity6 could not have accessed the methadone bottle - fitted with a child lock - himself			1
neglected : the judge said @entity9 and @entity37 had dosed their baby boy with methadone as a quick fix when they were unable to pacify him poisoned : police found a small measuring cup with traces of methadone on it , which the parents used to administer doses to calm their son ' like @entity5 ' mr @entity128 , prosecuting , previously told the jury that @entity6 died at the hands of his parents , who had been together for 13 years			1
he said : ' @entity6 was poisoned by being given methadone , a controlled drug used in the treatment of heroin addiction			0
' the drug was prescribed to both @entity10 and @entity9 at the time and was kept on top of a kitchen cupboard - out of any child 's reach			2
' it must have been given to him by an adult and only @entity10 and @entity9 were in a position to do so			2
' this was not the first time that @entity6 had been given methadone			0
' @entity147 followed that last dose and may have been caused by it alone - or it contributed significantly to it as a result of the cumulative effect of the previous taking of methadone			0
' killed by his own parents : by the time @entity6 was found dead , rigor mortis had already set in appalling : pub - goers said @entity6 was ' totally exhausted ' and ' crying ' the night before he died - and that his father tried to make him ride a plastic tricycle @entity6 was taken to the couple 's local pub , the @entity162 , the night before his death and was only taken home when the landlord insisted at 8.30pm			1
horrified regulars told the court how the toddler was ' totally exhausted ' and ' crying ' as his father repeatedly tried to make him ride a plastic tricycle			2
but when they returned back to the cramped and dirty flat , @entity37 and @entity9 began a drinking session with a friend - downing a bottle of vodka between them			1
@entity37 took a ' clingy ' and ' miserable ' @entity6 to bed at around 2.30am			0
she awoke at 6.45am but left the youngster to sleep			0
she did not check on him until 12.30pm on august 21 last year - when she discovered him dead , with rigor mortis having set in			0
mr @entity128 added : ' while each of them cared about @entity6 , he was not their priority			0
they were drug addicts whose need for drugs came before @entity6			0
' one of the officers who attended the property noticed that it smelled of cannabis			0
there was a potty in the living room that was full of urine			0
' gone too soon : prosecutor @entity128 told the court that both addicts cared about their son , but that drugs were their top priority post-mortem tests on @entity6 's blood showed he had taken ' a significant amount of methadone ' hours before his death , while hair samples showed the drug had been in his system for a ' long period of time '			0
forensic tests found @entity6 's dna on an empty 45ml bottle of methadone prescribed to @entity6 , which had been thrown in the kitchen bin			2
after their arrests , both @entity6 and @entity37 confirmed @entity6 would not have been able to access the methadone himself - but said they did not know how it came to be in his body			0
they denied charges of manslaughter , allowing or causing a child to die and cruelty to a person under the age of 16 , by giving @entity6 methadone between january 1 and august 22 last year			2
the day after finding his son dead , @entity6 left a tribute to him on @entity233 which read : ' @entity235 with the angles my first born mummy and daddy love u loads rip are little man words can not say how broken we are love u baby boy your broken hearted mummy and daddy x x xxx			0
