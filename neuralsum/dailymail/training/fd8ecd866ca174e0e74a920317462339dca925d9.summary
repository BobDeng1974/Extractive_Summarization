in fairness to @entity2 , there was only so much he could say			2
here he was , after all , in the bowels of the @entity4 , reflecting on the potentially negative impact of a flight on an @entity8 jet owned by his club ’s main sponsor			1
but @entity13 ’s manager was struggling to defend the position he had initially adopted when asked if a tired display against @entity16 was the product of a seven - hour journey the previous evening			1
in his post-match press conference he had politely but firmly rejected such accusations			2
in a side room later , however , he argued with less conviction , even admitting that his own view of the situation might have been flawed			2
‘ i am not saying what i am saying is the correct thing , ’ he said			0
‘ i give an opinion			0
’ @entity2 looks disheartened during @entity13 's defeat at the @entity4 @entity16 striker @entity29 celebrates after scoring for his side against @entity13 @entity16 's @entity31 celebrates after scoring in stoppage time to seal his side 's passage to the next round perhaps more telling was when @entity2 was asked if such a visit to the @entity40 home of his super-rich employers would have been arranged had they been playing @entity43 at @entity44 , the game which comes next for a @entity13 side now reflecting on back - to - back defeats after their loss to @entity50			1
‘ it was not a game with @entity43 , ’ he replied			0
‘ i do n’t want to say because you are telling me something that is not relative			0
’ so he was asked again			0
would they have spent 14 hours on a plane , not to mention five days in a different time zone , had it been the week they were meeting their main rivals for the @entity62 title ? ‘ @entity43 stayed here			1
they did not go to @entity40 , ’ he said			1
they did not go to @entity40			1
i respect your opinion but you respect also mine			0
’ with the greatest respect his point was not a terribly valid one when @entity69 defeats for @entity43 and @entity63 do not hide the fact that landing back so late from @entity40 — around 8pm — amounted to far from ideal preparation			1
manager @entity2 and his players arrived back in @entity73 at about 8pm on friday night @entity74 and @entity75 headed straight to the club 's training base to prepare for saturday 's game as @entity2 acknowledged , it was not a game against @entity43			2
no , it was an @entity69 game against @entity84 opposition and the @entity13 hierarchy obviously thought it the perfect week to put in an appearance for their sponsors			1
it somewhat undermined @entity2 ’s claim in his own programme notes that @entity13 were taking this competition every bit as seriously as the @entity62 and @entity94			2
that , having been eliminated by @entity84 opposition in @entity98 the previous season , they were going to give this a real shot			0
‘ we want to be at @entity103 later in the season and we do n’t prioritise the trophies we are involved in , ’ he wrote			0
only they do , even if we probably have to be fair to @entity2 and recognise how unlikely it is that the trip would have been his idea			0
in this modern era of the game managers often have to bow to the demands of the money men			0
presumably , they will do nothing to disrupt what now follows this weekend ; that encounter with the current league leaders			0
the only flight @entity13 should consider boarding this week should be one to @entity119			1
@entity13 players @entity121 ) , @entity122 and @entity123 look dejected after their side concede @entity13 played a friendly match against @entity128 side @entity126 during a trip to @entity40 whether this trip would have taken place if @entity13 had been playing @entity43 remains doubtful			1

@entity13 lost 2 - 0 to @entity16 in the @entity69 *fourth* round
@entity29 and @entity31 scored the goals at the @entity4
city had spent the week in @entity40 and had a 14 - hour flight back
