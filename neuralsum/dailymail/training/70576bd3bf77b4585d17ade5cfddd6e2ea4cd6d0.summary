by @entity0 published : 13:39 est , 2 january 2013 updated : 06:48 est , 3 january 2013 mysterious ' monster ' outflows of charged particles from the centre of our @entity5 , stretching more than halfway across the sky , have been detected by astronomers			1
researchers say they contain an ' extraordinary ' amount of energy - but stress they pose to harm to us			1
the researchers were able to map the cosmic ' geysers ' of gas			0
this shows the ¿ geysers ¿ ( in blue ) shooting out of the @entity19 from top to bottom the outflows extend 50,000 light - years [ five hundred thousand million million kilometres ] out of the @entity22			1
that 's equal to half the diameter of our @entity5 ( which is 100,000 light - years — a million million million kilometres — across )			2
seen from @entity27 , the outflows stretch about two - thirds across the sky from horizon to horizon			1
the giant cosmic geysers were mapped mapped with @entity35 's 64 - m @entity34 radio telescope in @entity36 , and the outflows were detected by astronomers from @entity36 , the @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40			2
the finding is reported in today 's issue of @entity43			0
' these outflows contain an extraordinary amount of energy — about a million times the energy of an exploding star , " said the research team 's leader , @entity35 's dr @entity48			1
but the outflows pose no danger to @entity27 or the @entity51			1
the speed of the outflow is supersonic , about 1000 kilometres a second			0
' that 's fast , even for astronomers , " dr @entity48 said			0
' they are not coming in our direction , but go up and down from the @entity22			0
' we are 30,000 light - years away from the @entity61 , in the plane			0
they are no danger to us			0
' from top to bottom the outflows extend 50,000 light - years [ five hundred thousand million million kilometres ] out of the @entity22			2
that 's equal to half the diameter of our @entity5 ( which is 100,000 light - years — a million million million kilometres — across )			2
seen from @entity27 , the outflows stretch about two - thirds across the sky from horizon to horizon			1
the outflows correspond to a ' haze ' of microwave emission previously spotted by the @entity78 and @entity79 space telescopes and regions of gamma - ray emission detected with @entity84 's @entity83 space telescope in 2010 , which were dubbed the ' @entity85 '			0
however , the the @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity83 observations did not provide enough evidence to indicate definitively the source of the radiation they detected , but the new @entity34 observations do			0
a second view of the ' galactic geysers ' that have been mapped ' the options were a quasar - like outburst from the black hole at the @entity61 , or star - power — the hot winds from young stars , and exploding stars , ' said team member dr @entity102 of the @entity103 , in @entity104 , @entity105			1
' our observations tell us it 's star - power			2
' in fact , the outflows appear to have been driven by many generations of stars forming and exploding in the @entity61 over the last hundred million years			1
the key to determining this was to measure the outflows ' magnetic fields			1
' we did this by measuring a key property of the radio waves from the outflows — their polarisation , ' said team member dr @entity122 of the @entity123 in @entity124 , @entity125 , and the @entity126			0
the new observations also help to answer one of astronomers ' big questions about our @entity5 : how it generates and maintains its magnetic field			0
' the outflow from the @entity61 is carrying off not just gas and high - energy electrons , but also strong magnetic fields , ' said team member dr @entity136 of @entity137 in @entity40			1
' we suspect this must play a big part in generating the @entity5 's overall magnetic field			0

outflows contain an extraordinary amount of energy — about a million times that of an exploding star
*believed* to be caused by ' star power ' from many generations of exploding stars
researchers say they pose no harm to @entity27 - but could be *crucial* to magnetic fields
seen from @entity27 , the outflows stretch about two - thirds across the sky from horizon to horizon
