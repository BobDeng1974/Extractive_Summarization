by @entity0 published : 04:46 est , 13 september 2013 updated : 08:27 est , 13 september 2013 it has survived the onslaught of apps that turn a smartphone into an e-reader			0
but a new device is set to take on the @entity7 by offering similar features			0
one of the main reasons people also buy a @entity7 is because of its e-ink display - its low - power meaning it lasts much longer than a phone , and its anti-glare screen means it can be read in bright light			1
now , a new phone case with a flexible e-ink display adds a second screen to an @entity20 or @entity21 - doing away with the need for both gadgets			1
but they also point out that it also has features that a @entity7 does not the screen can be used to read books in bright sunlight , but it also connects to and ' mirrors ' the phone 's main screen - showing notifications , photos or anything else that the main screen can show			1
the @entity45 screen also uses less battery than the phone 's display , too , and because it is called ' always on ' , which means it does n't timeout , it is a simpler and more energy - efficient way to watch videos , for example			1
the clever case , which is available to pre-order via the company 's website costs $ 129 ( £ 81 ) , or $ 149 ( £ 94 ) when shipped to the @entity56			1
the company says its case ' enables bookworms to forgo carrying a @entity7 ' because text can be displayed on the back of their @entity20			2
pages are turned by double - tapping the case , which contains a ' tactile interface ' controlled by the handset 's accelerometer			0
just like @entity70 's e-reader , the @entity45 case only uses power when the text or images changes and the e-ink screen is anti-glare and can be read in direct sunlight			1
the company claims the case can be used as an energy - saving measure so users can see urgent notifications , maps , notes or their calender without having to constantly turn their @entity20 on and off , which can be useful if a handset is almost out of battery			2
always on : the screen can display virtually anything and because it uses e-ink technology , it can be kept for long periods of time without using much energy when they first started out , @entity92 and @entity93 wanted their product to be able to add some creative edge to the ubiquitous @entity20			2
they originally built it simply as a way to display pictures and give @entity20 users a way to personalise their phones			0
but after testing , they worked out that they could do a lot more with the case and decided to add more practical features			0
but what makes this product so practical is that it uses e-ink technology , which only requires minimal power to stay on			0
the phone case , which turns the back of an @entity20 into a second screen , is avauilable to pre-order in two colours for $ 129 and its creators said an @entity123 version might be released in the future so while notifications on the main @entity20 screen will disappear after minutes , those on the @entity128 will not , which makes the second screen more useful for lengthy tasks			1
the device is designed to be user - friendly and mimic the @entity20 's features , as well as getting its power from the @entity20 without having to charge it separately			2
@entity45 partnered with @entity137 , experts in flexible display technology , to make the ' shatterproof ' second screen			2
it uses @entity137 's @entity140 ( organic thin film transistor ) backplane display technology and the screen is called electrophoretic because it moves fluid around an electric field			0
the designers are now looking into making a larger version of @entity128 for the @entity123 as well as whether a dedicated reading app can be developed for the case to make full use of its e-ink screen			1
the case itself is ' ruggedised ' so as well as being an extra screen , the company claims it is ' nearly indestructable ' and still protects the phone			0
the phone used crowd - funding website @entity161 to raise $ 219,417 ; exceeding its goal of $ 150,000 .			0

@entity45 's phone case adds a second screen to the back of a phone
the e-ink display is similar to the @entity7 's and can be used to read books in bright sunlight
because it is an e-ink screen , it uses less power than a phone 's screen and can be used to *preserve* battery life
the @entity20 and @entity21 cases start at $ 129 ( £ 81 ) and go on sale next month
@entity45 's creators are now working on an @entity123 version
