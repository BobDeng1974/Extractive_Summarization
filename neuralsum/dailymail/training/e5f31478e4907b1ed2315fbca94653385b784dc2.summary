@entity12 oil industry analyst , @entity54 said the militants were using their control of a 150 - mile swathe of territory to take crude oil from some of @entity12 ’s prime oil assets			2
he told the paper : ' in some ways it ’s as easy for @entity2 as digging a hole and letting the oil run before siphoning it off into tankers for transportation and @entity70 is a huge complex that it may not fully control but it can take supplies			2
' the prisoners who were killed came from a rival @entity75 denomination to the @entity77 @entity12 army , were fleeing the violence when they were recaptured and killed , according to human rights campaigners			2

it was claimed that eight of the victims were boys who were less than 18 years old			0
the attacks were thought to be revenge by the @entity12 forces after @entity2 took huge swathes of the country in the face of startlingly little resistance			1
it was widely reported that @entity2 added to the chaos around its lightning advance last month by letting inmates loose from @entity12 jails , in the hope they would join their insurgency			1
the watchdog listed five incidents where @entity12 are believed to have carried out the killings , drawing on testimonies from government workers , hospital staff and lawyers			0
the accounts include reports of handcuffed , blindfolded and burned bodies being dumped into a ravine near @entity31 , @entity12 's second city , which was overrun by @entity2 on june 9			1

in a further incident , the watchdog cites testimonies that prisoners whom @entity12 officials said died in crossfire were in fact killed ' execution - style ' by vengeful commanders after an assault			2
a spokesman for @entity39 said : ' @entity150 down prisoners is an outrageous violation of international law			0
' ' while the world rightly denounces the atrocious acts of @entity2 , it should not turn a blind eye to sectarian killing sprees by government and pro-government forces			0
' the organisation has demanded an international inquiry be held into the alleged killings			2
@entity2 themselves , whose forces now call themselves the @entity9 , have been subject to a tide of condemnation after footage of their own mass executions emerged			1
executions : @entity2 themselves has also been attacked for carrying out even more brutal executions , such as the ones from mid-june pictured above where militants marched up and down rows of bodies shooting them firing squad : however , @entity39 said that the brutality of @entity2 does not excuse @entity12 forces of adopting similar tactics in their fight against them one man was shown being forced to kneel by the roadside before he was shot in the back of the head , while other gruesome pictures emerged of militants marching up and down rows of prone bodies apparently firing machine guns into them			1
the claims against @entity12 forces came as their grip on the country slipped further with the advance of @entity6 security forces into disputed oil fields			1
the takeover of the @entity199 and @entity200 oil fields were the latest land grabs by @entity202 , who have responded to @entity2 by seizing more territory of their own			0

territory : @entity6 - controlled @entity200 , pictured , was hit by car bombs yesterday , killing dozens of people aftermath : security forces stand guard this morning after the attacks just outside of the disputed city but until now they had not moved into the oil fields themselves			0
on friday , however , the fighters took over the @entity228 and @entity200 fields and expelled local workers , the @entity224 in @entity225 said			0
@entity224 spokesman @entity230 denounced the move as ' a violation to the constitution ' and warned that it poses ' a threat to national unity			0
' the @entity237 said its forces moved to secure the fields after learning of what it said were orders by officials in the @entity224 to sabotage a pipeline linking oil facilities in the area			0
it said production would continue , and that staff can return but will operate under @entity6 management			0
ties between @entity202 and the central @entity225 government are rapidly unravelling as the country fragments in the face of the @entity21 militant blitz , led by @entity9 extremists			0
expansion : the accusations came as peshmerga fighters from the autonomous @entity6 region of @entity12 took control of lucrative oil fields just outside the city of @entity200 the country is effectively being cleaved along ethnic and sectarian lines - the swath of militant - held @entity21 areas , the shiite - majority south and center ruled by the @entity77 - led government in @entity225 and the @entity6 north			1
the @entity273 and other world powers , as well as @entity12 's top @entity77 cleric , have pressed for a more inclusive government that @entity12 of all stripes can rally around			2
