stalking through the rough grass a runaway rhea scopes its next move			2
this footage is the first video captured of the @entity6 bird , which is the height of man and can disembowel a human with one thwack of its three - pronged claw			1
despite the bird 's size - they can weigh up to 90lb - as the hunt for the runaway rhea of @entity17 gathers momentum , the locals seem to be treating the whole thing as a bit of a laugh			1
the @entity22 tracked down this giant flightless bird – a 45mph ostrich - cum - emu usually found on @entity6 pampas – to a golf course outside @entity27 , @entity28			1
latest sighting : @entity30 captured this image of the missing rhea bird which can run at speeds of up to 40mph at @entity34 , near @entity27 , @entity28 @entity35 down : despite the missing rhea bird being capable of killing a man with a single whack of its claw , locals at the @entity41 , near @entity27 , pictured , do n't seem concerned and by close of play yesterday evening , the ‘ birdie ’ gags were becoming unbearable in the 19th hole at @entity34			1
mind you , they might not be chortling quite so happily the next time they ’re poking around in the rough for a missing ball … for even if we have now narrowed down the chase , no one seems to think there is much chance of trapping this monster feather duster in the near future			2
it is nearly four weeks since the six - year - old female rhea went on the run from @entity60 ’s smallholding in @entity61 on the @entity17 / @entity28 border			1
@entity60 has kept rheas for many years – among her horses , sheep , geese , ducks and cats – in order to keep down the weeds on her 11 acres			2
no one is entirely sure why the bird escaped , although @entity60 thinks it may have been spooked by the local hunt passing nearby			1
‘ i followed her for four hours with a bucket of food , but you ca n’t herd these creatures and so i gave up , ’ says @entity60 , who still has three remaining rheas , all one - year - old offspring of the runaway mum			1
since rheas are not remotely maternal ( after laying their eggs , they leave the hatching and childcare to the males ) , it is unlikely that this one will be feeling any pangs of remorse			2
certainly , as i drop in on the abandoned trio , they all seem perfectly happy			2
in recent days , however , there have been sporadic sightings of @entity96 across a five - mile radius hereabouts			1
spotted : a cyclist took this picture of the fugitive @entity6 rhea - which stands at around six - foot tall - in countryside north east of @entity103 in @entity28 at the weekend on the hunt : the @entity22 's @entity105 goes in search of the missing rhea bird in the rape seed fields of @entity109 , @entity28 on sunday , civil engineer @entity110 managed to take a charming shot of the animal in a field of rapeseed just outside the village of @entity116			1
since then , a media circus has descended , armed with lurid warnings about the damage these birds can inflict when cornered			1
as i rapidly discover , though , we ’re not exactly talking @entity123 of @entity124 , let alone @entity125			2
‘ we ’re all looking out for it now , ’ says @entity110 ’s wife , @entity126 , a piano teacher			2
‘ it ’s funny because my husband ’s always been a keen photographer and so has his father			2
‘ his dad once had a picture published in the @entity133			2
now , @entity110 ’s gone one better with a picture in the national papers and we ’ve even had have i got news for you on the phone ! ’ @entity139 , ten , is determined to go one better and has been out trying to capture some video footage			0
is he a little scared ? after all , the @entity141 and the cops are warning people not to approach the bird , even though @entity60 ’s young brood would n’t say boo to one of her geese			1
he said : ' you can see the bird standing in a couple of the shots , in the others it was grubbing around in the rape field for food , or perhaps it was trying to bury its head in the sand			1
' it was about six feet high with its head up			0
' big bird : the runaway rhea was also photographed near @entity61 on thursday by cyclist @entity164 mr @entity164 took these two pictures with his mobile phone after the bird trotted off into a field of rape seed oil ‘ i ’m not worried , ’ says @entity139			1
‘ it ’s good fun			0
’ the locals have already named the bird @entity174 – after the singer , @entity175 – despite the fact that this rhea is a she			1
there is no great desire to see her returned to captivity			0
in fact , everyone seems to wish ‘ @entity174 ’ the best of luck			0
‘ i hope people just leave it alone			0
it ’ll be fine out there and there ’s plenty for it to eat , ’ says @entity186			0
as the joint master of the local hunt , the @entity193 , @entity186 knows this terrain better than anyone and agrees to be my guide			0
she first learned of the creature from her sister - in - law			1
‘ she ’d just fallen off her horse and came home talking about seeing an ostrich			1
we all thought she must have concussion and told her to lie down			0
then other people started saying the same			0
’ today , she has heard reports of sightings five miles away , near the 12th fairway at @entity34 , and off we go			0
it ’s charming countryside , narrow lanes meandering through gently undulating crop - filled fields sprinkled with thatched cottages and handsome little churches			1
we ’re only 35 miles from @entity217 and a short drive from @entity219 , but it ’s a tranquil spot with plenty of hedgerows and woods to provide cover for a furtive feathered giant			0
@entity34 is a delightful little club			0
at the clubhouse , @entity227 has just finished a round			0
has he seen a grey / brown @entity6 bird , about 5ft 8in tall ? ‘ so that ’s what it was , ’ he says			1
‘ i did catch a glimpse of something running across the 11th fairway			0
’ really hard to spot : the six - foot bird has been on the run for a month			1
they are also incredibly hard to catch because of their fast speeds disappeared : the rhea escaped from a smallholding in @entity61 on the @entity17 / @entity28 border the hunt closes in			1
he and his colleague , @entity249 , have not just seen the bird a few hours earlier , they have managed to capture it on their mobile phones			2
‘ @entity227 just said : “ there ’s that emu ! ”			0
it was about my height and minding its own business so we started filming , ’ says @entity247 , showing me the result			0
sure enough , there is ‘ @entity174 ’ , snooping around the western edge of the course			0
she certainly does n’t seem to pose a threat and just ambles off into the bushes when the two men get too close			0
later on , @entity227 ’s wife , @entity267 , says that she spotted the bird while out with her two young children and grabbed a snap of it on her phone			2
it is dashing across a nicely manicured fairway as purposefully as a club captain who has just spotted a non-member wearing inappropriate trousers and teeing off in the wrong direction			0
‘ i could n’t believe it when i saw it , ’ she says , ‘ but i ’m not sure i ’d want to get too close to it			0
’ by last night , word of our progress had spread and the media circus had started to descend on the fairways of @entity34			0
so why should a wild @entity6 bird take a fancy to golf ? @entity60 has another theory : ‘ a few years ago , i did sell a breeding pair to a man near @entity34 , and this one will be looking for a mate at this time of year			1
’ in which case , it may not be too long before this bit of @entity298 starts to see rather more exotic flightless birds running wild and causing mayhem			1
i fear i can see an @entity17 girl joke coming already …			0

@entity304 escaped from home in @entity61 , @entity28 , four weeks ago
the flightless birds have six - inch claws that can deliver fatal blow
native @entity6 birds are *increasingly* *popular* as pets in @entity313
owner @entity315 says she does n't know how to *recapture* it as it 's so fast
bird has now been tracked down - to a golf course in @entity27
