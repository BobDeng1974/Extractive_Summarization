by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent the failure of the political elite to understand public concern over immigration is fuelling mounting anger among voters , sociologists have found			2
the widening ‘ disconnect ’ between @entity15 ’s ‘ liberal political class ’ and the views of the public has contributed to the rise of @entity10 , according to the annual @entity12 survey			1
persistent public anxiety over high levels of immigration is something the mainstream parties ignore at their peril , it concluded			2
homeless : @entity27 migrants sleeping rough in @entity28 , central @entity29			0
the annual @entity12 survey has said the gap between the liberal elite and the rest of the country is fuelling tensions the survey found that fewer @entity36 now support the idea of multiculturalism than a decade ago			1
increasing numbers say being born in the @entity36 or having ‘ @entity36 ancestry ’ are important elements of a @entity36 identity			1
and , when asked about what makes people ‘ truly @entity36 ’ , 95 per cent of the survey ’s participants said speaking @entity47 was an important factor – up from 85 per cent in 2003			1
the results follow a decade of mass immigration into the @entity36 since restrictions were lifted on @entity52			1
there are now some 2.5million more foreign - born @entity36 residents than a decade ago , including around a million from @entity55 and the seven other countries that joined in 2004			1
@entity57 ’s @entity10 came top in the @entity52 elections and second in the @entity59 by - election , in part over concerns about immigration and @entity65 rules that keep @entity36 ’s borders open			1
metropolitan class : there is a ' disconnect ' between the rest of the public and @entity15 , said the report more than eight out of ten people now support a major tightening of rules on access to benefits and curbs on overall immigration			1
the @entity12 survey , which has been carried out every year for 30 years , pointed out the @entity65 rules make it ‘ very hard ’ for the government to cut the numbers coming here			1
it said : ‘ there is a clear , and intense , demand for action on the issue from one section of the electorate , a demand politicians ignore at their peril			0
‘ yet responding to the concerns of the voters worried about immigration today risks alienating the rising sections of the electorate whose political voice will become steadily louder in elections to come			0
’ the survey found that 47 per cent believe immigration has had a negative economic impact , compared with only 31 per cent who see it as positive			2
some 45 per cent said they thought immigration had ‘ undermined @entity36 cultural life ’ , while 35 per cent said it had enriched @entity36 culture			2
the report said : ‘ policymakers and the interest groups they deal with regularly tend to be drawn heavily from the liberal end of the spectrum , creating a potential for disconnect and distrust between a more liberal political class which accepts immigration and an electorate among whom many find it intensely threatening			0
@entity123 in the @entity15 hen house : fears over immigration have helped the fortunes of parties such as @entity10 ‘ this combination of persistent public anxiety , the disconnect in attitudes between political elites and voters , and constraints on policymakers ’ ability to respond have helped to fuel the rise in support for @entity10			1
‘ in many areas of migration policy , constraints on current policy mean it is more liberal than even the most pro-immigration parts of the public would like , generating widespread public discontent which is hard to address			0
for example , @entity65 rules make it very hard for the government to restrict migrant numbers , or regulate migrant access to the welfare state , in accordance with the wishes of most of the public			0
’ @entity157 mp @entity156 said the report represented a ‘ huge condemnation ’ of politicians ’ policies on immigration and said it would be unforgivable for them to respond			0
‘ one of the things we must do in drawing up our red and blue lines for renegotiating in @entity168 is that we have to have control of our borders again , ’ he said			0
the political elite has been accused for years of not taking public concerns about immigration seriously – often dismissing such fears as ‘ racist ’			2
most famously , during the last election @entity175 was caught on tape accusing a woman of being a ‘ bigot ’ because she asked him about @entity52 immigrants			0
last month , @entity182 defence minister @entity181 said some of her constituents who raised immigration with her were ‘ frankly racist ’ .			0

gap between urban elite and rest of @entity36 helps @entity10 , says annual study
@entity12 survey says fewer @entity36 support multiculturalism
some 95 *%* say speaking @entity47 is a crucial part of being ' truly @entity36 '
