the minister who married @entity1 and his third wife @entity2 today relived their wedding day and said his heart went out to the woman who was the star 's ' soulmate			1
' in an interview with @entity11 , @entity9 reveals the @entity12 superstar - found by his assistant after hanging himself at his home earlier this week - was so in love with his bride , that the star was involved in every detail of the february 2011 wedding to make it perfect			1
he recalls how the comedian made a bee - line for him after he 'd given a sermon at a memorial service for the parents of one of his staff , and @entity1 told him he took great comfort from the minister 's analogy of death being the same as birth			1
rev. @entity9 officiated at the ceremony and tells @entity11 there were around 120 guests at the low - key affair , mostly family , close friends and neighbors keeping the faith : @entity49 was asked by @entity1 to perform his wedding ceremony after he heard the minister at a memorial service			1
@entity53 says the actor was quite taken by the idea that dying was merely a journey towards a ' fuller experience of life and love ' it was after this powerful first meeting that @entity1 decided he wanted the @entity64 minister – who is not affiliated to any particular faith – to officiate at his wedding to graphic designer @entity2 in october 2011			1
the reverend , a former @entity68 priest originally from @entity69 in @entity64 , told @entity11 : ' @entity1 and his lovely wife @entity2 first came into my life about seven years ago			1
‘ the parents of a young man who worked for @entity1 on his properties had both died in a tragic car accident and i was officiating the memorial service			1
‘ afterwards i remember that he came up to me and said he very much liked the service and found it very consoling			0
' he said he was particularly touched with my analogy of death being similar to birth			1
i had said that when a baby is born they do n't know what they are being born into - but they are being born into a fuller experience of life and love with their families			0
' death is the same - in my opinion we are not dying - we 're born into another experience that is greater than ourselves and that is an extension of what it is to love and be loved			2
napa nuptials : @entity1 and @entity2 's wedding was held at the magnificent @entity103 luxury resort in @entity104 , @entity105			1
' he was very taken by this analogy and we talked about it for about 10 minutes – just the two of us			0
' @entity1 's father was episcopalian and his mother a @entity110 , but it is believed that @entity1 did not follow either path , although he embraced @entity113			1
' you get a real strong sense of @entity116 when you go through rehab , ' he said			0
@entity53 says that @entity1 was a very ' nice , humble , appreciative man			2
' ‘ he was very generous of spirit and this his death is truly a tragedy for the whole world , ’ he said.it was some years later in 2011 that @entity1 asked the reverend to officiate at his wedding to third wife @entity2 at the posh @entity103 luxury resort in @entity121 , @entity105			1
@entity53 remembers with great fondness how happy and in love the couple were on their ‘ beautiful ’ wedding day and believes @entity2 will now be struggling to cope with losing her soul mate , ' @entity53 said			1
' the wedding day was very beautiful - they were very much in love and very quiet			1
both @entity1 and @entity2 were very actively involved with the preparation of the ceremony			1
' i like couples to be in the driving seat when it comes to the ceremony and i encourage them to write their own vows and decide how they want the ceremony to be			0
i remember that @entity1 was very involved - he did n't just sit there and nod his head			2
' he had a special request to honor his mother and brother , who had passed away , by having a beautiful prayer - the prayer of @entity150 read out			1
' they both wanted to make sure their children were involved too - @entity1 's three children and @entity2 's two young boys , and were very appreciative that i made that happen			1
' say yes to the dress : @entity2 's stunning strapless gown was designed by @entity159 , a couture designer based in @entity160			2
@entity53 remembers with great fondness how happy and in love the couple were on their ' beautiful ' wedding day and believes @entity2 will be struggling to cope with losing her soul mate			1
@entity167 did a ' mood board ' for the bride ( http://www.coroflot.com/laurenmyers/fall-projects ) @entity53 said around 120 guests attended the modest wedding - mostly family , close friends and neighbors			2
there was no @entity12 glitz and glamor attached to it and the reverend says he does n't recall seeing any of the big name stars who starred alongside @entity1 over the years			2
' @entity1 and @entity2 created their own vows , ' he recalls			1
' it was a lovely gathering with people mingling and jingling with each other			0
‘ they also invited my wife and i to stay for the wedding dinner which was very lovely of them			0
usually we just leave 20 minutes or so after the ceremony			0
’ the reverend , who lives in @entity194 , @entity105 with wife @entity195 , said he was hit with a ' bolt of sadness ' when he first heard @entity1 had died and was equally shocked to hear about @entity1 's diagnosis of @entity200			2
he pointed out he was keen to avoid using the term suicide and urged people not to judge the @entity205 - winning star ’s actions			0
‘ i know that for me and rest of the community round here it came as a shock , ' he said			0
‘ i have no idea how @entity1 responded to being diagnosed with @entity200			2
‘ i know it can mean having a horrible last 15 to 20 years of life and if you have other things going on in your life such as depression it may be harder to process it			0
picture of happiness : the newlyweds honeymooned in @entity222			0
they walked the streets stopping to kiss and hug and looked very much in love ‘ it could have been an exacerbating factor in his death but we ’ll never know			0
' i personally believe @entity1 has died as a result of depression			0
' @entity53 , who conducts weddings and other services for an organization called your ceremony matters as well as offering support and counseling , kept in touch with @entity1 and his wife after they got married			1
he said he has reached out to them several times since their wedding to offer them his prayers and support – including in july when @entity1 entered a rehab facility in @entity247			2
and @entity53 sent his condolences to @entity2 as soon as he found out about @entity1 's untimely death			1
he now believes that @entity1 ’s passing leaves many unanswered and uncomfortable questions			0
he said : ‘ the great puzzle with the tragic way in which @entity1 died is how can a person do that to their wife and children ? this was a couple that were absolutely in tune with each other - not in a mushy way - just in a very lovely way			1
‘ but you have to remember that depression hits the inner layer of our hearts			0
when someone is in that world – it ’s difficult to see out			0
‘ people describe it as feeling imprisoned in a dark room with no switch – and in that situation it 's so difficult to think of others			0
it ’s legitimate for his wife and family and indeed others to ask why he did this			0
' wife @entity2 has released two moving statements since her husband ’s death on monday			2
remembrance : @entity53 tells @entity11 that @entity1 requested that the @entity291 be included in the wedding service to honor his mother and brother , who had passed away in the last one , issued yesterday , emotional @entity2 told how @entity1 ’s legacy was the ‘ joy and happiness he offered to others , particularly to those fighting personal battles ’			1
she added : ' @entity1 's sobriety was intact and he was brave as he struggled with his own battles of depression , anxiety as well as early stages of @entity200 , which he was not yet ready to share publicly			2
' it is our hope in the wake of @entity1 ’s tragic passing , that others will find the strength to seek the care and support they need to treat whatever battles they are facing so they may feel less afraid			0
' @entity53 supported @entity2 's tragic plea that those who need help should seek it and said she was very selfless for thinking of others at this time			2
‘ it is touching that she is thinking of others who are hurting when she is hurting herself , ' he said			0
‘ i truly believe @entity1 ' tragic passing has impacted the spirit of humanity			0
hopefully people will now seek the help they need			0
’ @entity53 added that he had not been approached to officiate @entity1 ’s funeral or memorial service but believed like their wedding it would be a private , low - key affair			1
he said : ‘ it would be a great honor to officiate the funeral - it would be a profound privilege after having officiated @entity1 ’s wedding and hearing the vows and prayers			1
‘ of course i would love to and i would like to respond in any way i can to help the family at this incredibly sad time			0
