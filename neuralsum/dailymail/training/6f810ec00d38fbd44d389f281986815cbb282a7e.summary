@entity6 , 42 , first took his car in for a service at the official @entity1 garage to check over the speedometer and tracking			1
but when he got his focus back he said half a tank of fuel had been used so decided to activate the dashboard camera when he returned the car for further repairs			1
when he watched the footage , he was stunned to discover a mechanic joyriding his car at breakneck speeds - reaching up to 118mph			2
mr @entity6 , from @entity21 , @entity22 , said : ' they have violated my trust , joy ridden my car and lied to me			1
the footage - shot on a tiny camera on the central mirror - also shows him revving the engine , driving as quickly as possible from 0 - 60mph and squeezing past oncoming traffic			1
worse still , when the mechanism returns to the garage , the audio microphone catches him and a colleague rifling through bags in the car			0
garage bosses said they were taking the incident ' extremely seriously ' and had launched an internal investigation and were taking disciplinary action			0
father - of - one mr @entity6 said : ' they were just using and abusing my car , flooring it up and down the motorway			1
' i bet this happens all the time and they keep getting away with it			0
' they may be doing it to everyone 's ' cars , and people might not even realise			0
' it was just like being burgled , them rummaging though my car , and the driving was so dangerous			0
' the father - of - one , watching back the footage , feared they may be doing it to other people 's cars as well the footage showed the mechanic driving at 106mph in a 60 - zone during the test drive on @entity46 the clip showed a series of hair - raising moments when the test driver squeezed past cars on a junction the clip shows the mechanic driving out of the industrial estate - where there is a 30mph speed limit - at 56mph , even when he is approaching a junction			1
later , a sign at the side of the road shows a 40mph limit but the mechanic cruises at 54mph , speeding up to 84mph as he nears a roundabout			2
he then drives at 106mph in a 60 - zone and reaches 108mph as he passes a sign saying ' police speed check this area ' before pushing the car to its limits at 118mph			1
he speeds at 71mph down a 60 - zone before performing a u-turn , revving the engine repeatedly , and returning at 93mph			1
on a single carriage way 60mph road he also overtakes an @entity115 car and has to squeeze between it and an oncoming car			0
his final burst is a 62mph drive down a 40mph road which is half coned off , while he zooms past a sign warning him he is just 250yards from a set of traffic lights			0
finally , back in the garage , two workers can be heard discussing the contents of a bag in the car - with one rummaging through the contents			2
mr @entity6 first took his @entity1 in for a service and new tyres at @entity132 , @entity45 , just before @entity133 , and also asked workers at the official @entity1 garage to check the speedometer and the tracking his final burst is a 62mph drive down a 40mph road which is half coned off , while he zooms past a sign warning him he is just 250yards from a set of traffic lights after watching the footage , mr @entity6 went back to complain and showed a staff member the clip			1
he said he was ' absolutely mortified ' and offered a full Â£ 500 refund and two new tyres			0
