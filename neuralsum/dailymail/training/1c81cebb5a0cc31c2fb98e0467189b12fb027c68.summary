by @entity0 published : 11:49 est , 16 january 2014 updated : 13:50 est , 16 january 2014 ' oh what a grand reunion we shall have at the @entity5 when you come home			2
my word , the school will look full and how we shall talk			2
i wish someone had a camera and could just snap us			2
' sadly for @entity14 , her humble dreams would never come true			0
instead , her fiance , @entity15 , was killed on the @entity16 on the very day she wrote her touchingly hopeful letter			1
the poignant story of @entity20 , her childhood sweetheart and her last letter to him is one of many heartbreaking stories that emerge from a new collection of wartime correspondence - much of it between lovers and families who would never be reunited			1
poignant : the new book includes letters written by both soldiers and their sweethearts at home writing home : @entity36 soldiers were n't the only ones to write - this is a @entity39 postcard , dated 1916 although most were written by @entity36 soldiers , not every epistle was destined for these shores			1
among the missives unearthed by editor @entity43 are loving words penned by the spouse of @entity47 trooper , @entity48 , and a love letter written by @entity51 lieutenant @entity50 to his @entity53 sweetheart			1
tragically , like so many of the correspondents , lieutenant @entity50 was killed just 10 days after writing his letter while fighting in @entity57 on the @entity58			1
while most of the letters come from ordinary sweethearts , the collection also includes the words of famous names , among them @entity64 , whose final goodbye was happily never sent			1
words penned by writer @entity67 , who immortalised her fiance , @entity68 , in @entity69 after he was killed in 1915 , also appear as does an early letter written by @entity71			1
although @entity67 and @entity71 's letters are well - known , the words of the ordinary men and women torn apart by the war are not - but are just as poignant			1
particularly heartbreaking is the goodbye letter written by @entity78 to his sweetheart @entity79 , written while on leave in may 1916 , three months before his death			0
tragic : gunner @entity78 's final letter to his sweetheart , @entity79 , is splotched and blurred with tearstains the note , which is marked by tearstained splotches , is oddly prescient and begins : ' i am writing just a line win in case of accidents			0
just to let you know i have always loved you dear			0
' you are the best little girl on @entity94 's @entity93 have i told you before [ sic ]			0
but i am writing this because i have a feeling that i shall not come back again			0
' another letter , written by sergeant @entity98 to his young daughter @entity99 as he was dying of his wounds in an @entity102 hospital , expresses some of the bitter grief felt by the soldier fathers who never got to see their children grow up			0
in it , sergeant @entity98 writes that he had ' wished to spend many happy years with you ' and , poignantly , concludes : ' i am writing because i want you to know in after years how dearly i loved you			0
' you can only hope that , unlike so many letters , this was one of the missives that made it through			2
@entity114 , edited by @entity115 with a foreword by @entity117 , Â £ 16.99 , @entity118 grief : @entity120 wrote of her love to private @entity122 but he was killed flying for the nascent @entity123 in 1918 tragic : @entity124 kept his daughters ' photo in his breast pocket ( r )			1
it was found when he was killed in 1917 @entity130 @entity129 wrote this letter to her sweetheart private @entity132 ( @entity133 ) from her @entity135 home in july 1918			2
tragically , @entity133 , whom she had known since 1913 , would become one of the last @entity36 casualties of the war when he was killed in action on 21 august 1918			1
' @entity133 - my own - my only love - how i look for your next letter - how much longer shall i have to wait ? @entity144 , i want you - my life - jack - how changed it is when you are by my side - what different air i seem to breathe into my lungs ! @entity133 - oh ! hasten the day - the moment when i shall be by his side again - @entity133 - my @entity152 - my same , same heartmate ! goodnight my love - @entity94 bless you my own			0
tuesday @entity153 - my own & how today ? how you would have smiled if you could have met me up the road today - yes ! you would then			0
to have seen me pushing @entity156 in his pram to @entity158 all on my own - @entity133 , if only - but then how can i say , how can i express all that is in my heart ? does my @entity133 know ? my love , my own , at such moments , @entity133 , when my love has looked , has seen into the very depths of my soul ... my @entity167 , ' our ' sacred love - when my very soul has been revealed to him - @entity133 - you know - how it grows and grows ! my heart - surely it will burst ! @entity133 - i want you - oh ! let me feel you crushing my very life into yours ! @entity133 - i live for you - always , always my own			0
