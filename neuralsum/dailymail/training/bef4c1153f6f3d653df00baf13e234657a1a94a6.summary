by @entity0 published : 08:24 est , 21 june 2013 updated : 09:00 est , 21 june 2013 an eco-conscious gardener who packed a trailer full of grass cuttings was turned away from a recycling site - because he was towing it on a bicycle			1
retired @entity8 was told by council officials that only motorised vehicles were allowed at the site for health and safety reasons even though pedestrians were walking around			1
the 66 - year - old has accused the council of hypocrisy - claiming they only promote recycling when it is convenient for them			1
health and safety : @entity8 , 66 , was told he could n't use facilities at a recycling site in @entity24 , @entity25 , because he was using a bicycle which posed a health and safety risk mr @entity8 had already filled up the brown waste bin supplied by the council for garden waste after trimming the hedges around his home in @entity33 , @entity25			1
the keen cyclist then adapted his trailer to fit on his bicycle so he could tow the green waste to the recycling centre in @entity24 , @entity33			1
but he was stunned when he was told he could n't bring his bicycle on to the site because of health and safety laws			2
he said : ' i just could n't believe it			0
i thought i was doing the right thing but then they told me that " you 're only allowed in if you 're towing your trailer using a car "			0
' they said my bike classed as a wheelbarrow , which i could n't understand because you do n't push it			0
risk : a spokesman for @entity55 , which runs the recycling facility pictured above , said the site would be dangerous for a cyclist because it has a ' constant flow of traffic ' ' i like to cycle , it 's good for the environment and i do n't believe in fly tipping			1
i try to do as much as i can to encourage my neighbours to recycle and i thought that the council wanted to be as environmentally friendly as possible			0
' after this i feel as though they actually only want to recycle if it 's easy for them			0
it 's very hypocritical of them to pretend they are in support of recycling when they stand by a decision like this			1
' @entity78 ' : @entity8 , 66 , accused the council of promoting recycling when it was convenient for them ' i feel very upset and angry at what has happened			1
i cycled two miles there to recycle and i had to take it all home			0
' a spokesman for @entity55 said the @entity24 site was a very busy one with a constant flow of traffic			1
they said : ' for this reason there would be concern for a cyclist who is moving around among cars and vans especially when they are reversing			0
' mr @entity8 will have been advised for his own safety not to use a bicycle on the site			1
' @entity102 , the @entity103 parliamentary spokesman for @entity33 , said : ' @entity8 contacted me and asked if i could help , so i checked it out and it 's true			2
' @entity106 say that for health and safety reasons , he 's not allowed to drop his waste at the site by bicycle			1
' they say they 'd be worried for him because of vehicle movements on site even although people walk across the site all the time and the maximum speed of cars is in the region of 5mph			0
' @entity8 is an example to us all			2
he is s true eco-warrior			0
by cycling he 's keeping down his carbon footprint			0
by taking his waste to a proper site he 's having it recycled			2
by refusing to fly tip , he 's helping to keep @entity33 tidy			0
' mr @entity102 added : ' @entity106 should be encouraging people like @entity8 , not putting him off			2
in order to get to the site he cycles along roads with 40mph speed limits and yet he 's not allowed to go to the re-cycling centre			0
' if the site is unsuitable for people like @entity8 , then the @entity106 should find somewhere else			2
or they could just show some common sense and change the rules			0
' @entity141 thinking : @entity8 has even made a specially converted trailer for his bike so he can transport things around without harming the environment			1

@entity8 had already filled up his garden waste recycling bin at home
@entity150 adapted trailer for his bike so he could tow waste to recycling site
*workers* at the @entity24 site in @entity25 turned him away for being on a bicycle
mr @entity8 claims ' hypocritical ' @entity160 *chiefs* only promote recycling when it 's convenient for them
