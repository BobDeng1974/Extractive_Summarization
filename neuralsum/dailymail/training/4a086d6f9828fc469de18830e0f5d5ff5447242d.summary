change : under @entity2 's reforms , patients will be able to register at any doctor 's surgery they like , allowing people to sign up with a gp near work or their children 's school patients will be able to register at any doctor ’s surgery they like from next october			1
traditional catchment areas will be abandoned , allowing people to sign up with a gp near work or their children ’s school			1
patients will also have the option of switching to popular surgeries , which will have @entity18 - style ratings under @entity2 ’s reforms			1
the health secretary has appointed a national inspector to put gp practices into four quality categories , helping patients decide which to use			1
‘ gps will have the freedom to take on more patients , ’ mr @entity2 told the @entity24 last night			1
‘ you will be able to find the most convenient gp practice for you			0
whether this is near to your work , your university , your school			0
this will help to reduce long - term pressures on our @entity36 services , give real choice to hard - working people , and drive up gps ’ standards			2
’ by allowing patients to register anywhere , it is expected that highly - rated gp practices and those which offer longer opening hours will thrive			1
families who move house will be able to stay with their trusted doctor rather than re-register at their new address			0
doctors will still be paid for the number of patients they have , so a surgery which is in demand will get more funding to cope with the greater workload			2
patients who join a practice a long distance away will not be eligible for home visits , but the local gp commissioning groups , and @entity65 which oversees them , will work on a system over the next year to ensure these patients can have visits if they become too ill to attend a surgery			2
mr @entity2 announced in yesterday ’s @entity24 that he had torn up the controversial gp contract , signed under @entity71 , which had ‘ broken the link ’ between @entity25 and patients			1
from april , @entity74 ’s four million over- 75s will have a personal doctor to oversee their care and telephone consultations day and night			0
this reform is also expected to ease the pressure on casualty units			0
mr @entity2 said the botched gp contract had led to nine out of ten surgeries closing in the evening and at weekends			1
@entity84 , a family doctor in @entity85 and deputy chairman of the @entity88 ’s gp committee , said catchment areas would continue , except for ‘ a different type of patient who can register in any practice anywhere ’			1
success : by allowing patients to register anywhere , it is expected that highly - rated gp practices and those which offer longer opening hours will thrive he added : ‘ it would benefit those who are regularly away from home so they would not need to take time off work for appointments			1
but it is fraught with problems which will need to be worked out over the next year			0
people being able to join a gp practice anywhere could have unintended consequences			0
’ under a separate deal , also aimed at improving transparency and choice , doctors ’ pay will be published to help patients evaluate whether they are getting value for money			2
doctors will no longer have automatic pay rises for long service but will be paid for the number of patients they have			2
the £ 450million handed out in seniority pay and inducements for hitting tick - box targets , which doctors say waste their time , will instead be given to @entity25 to invest in patient care and prevent unnecessary admissions to @entity36			0
only their income from the taxpayer will be published , not that for private work			0
@entity139 , a @entity71 health spokesman , said : ‘ people should be able to join a convenient surgery , but the important part is whether they can get an appointment			0
under this government , it ’s getting harder to see your family doctor			0
