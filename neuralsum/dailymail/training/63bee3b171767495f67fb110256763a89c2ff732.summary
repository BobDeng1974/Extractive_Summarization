by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity3 editor @entity2 has resigned in the wake of his decision to publish topless photos of @entity7 @entity8 is set to introduce new privacy laws after the @entity7 topless photos scandal - as a newspaper editor who published the pictures was tonight suspended from his post			1
@entity3 editor @entity14 was put on leave while an investigation is carried out into why the paper published the photos			1
it came as @entity20 , the @entity21 , decided to revive abandoned legislation amid the continued fallout from the holiday images of the @entity25			1
his comments that some of the country 's print media place no value on a right to privacy come amid reports the @entity3 could be shut down after its decision to publish the photos			1
‘ it is clear that some sections of the print media are either unable or unwilling in their reportage to distinguish between prurient interest and the public interest , ’ mr @entity20 said			2
the government will reopen privacy legislation first proposed several years ago			1
mr @entity20 said some print media place ‘ perceived financial gain ’ ahead of ‘ any principled freedom of expression ’			2
more than 100 jobs would go in @entity48 if the @entity3 shut			2
its co-owner @entity49 reacted furiously to the decision to print the photos that have caused anger in @entity53			2
mr @entity49 , whose @entity55 group also owns the @entity56 and @entity3 in the @entity53 , has said he will take ' immediate steps ' to close the paper because it splashed 13 pictures of the nude royal across its pages			1
the decision to print was made by the @entity3 's editor @entity14 , who did not inform mr @entity49 that they would use the images taken with a long lens in @entity67 earlier this month			1
' i am very angry at the decision to publish these photographs and am taking immediate steps to close down the joint venture , ' mr @entity49 said			1
' even if the paper survives , as its other owner @entity90 ( @entity90 ) would like , mr @entity2 's position looks very precarious after the @entity92 said his decision was ' motivated by greed '			1
angry : media baron @entity49 last night announced he was taking immediate steps to terminate his involvement with the @entity3 if the paper is saved from the chopping block it will probably lose the right to use the @entity103 name			1
' on behalf of @entity90 , i wish to offer my deepest apologies , ' @entity90 chief executive @entity104 said			0
' we are launching an internal inquiry to ensure there will never be a repeat of this breach of decency			0
' the @entity3 's newsroom is said to be gripped with ' fear , panic and dismay ' today			2
the @entity117 in @entity48 criticised mr @entity49 's threat to shut down the @entity8 operation and accused him of double standards on the basis of some of his business interests , including the adult television x channel			1
@entity125 , the general secretary of the @entity8 @entity117 , said the media mogul 's threats are just to ' ingratiate himself with the @entity53 establishment in the @entity130 environment			1
' the @entity56 has been blasted for its coverage at times , particularly some of its stories on the disappearance of @entity138 child @entity136			0
@entity90 , which owns 50 per cent of the paper , has issued a grovelling apology but may still support the title			2
relaxed : @entity7 and @entity142 continued to enjoy their tour after they heard the news			0
here , they are pictured on a boat ride to @entity149 in the @entity150 prince @entity142 and wife @entity7 wave to the crowds on a truck decorated as a canoe as they depart @entity155 on the @entity150 all smiles : @entity7 and @entity142 's @entity158 tour was a huge success despite the problems that dogged the couple it believes full closure would be ' disproportionate '			0
all @entity53 papers have refrained from publishing the photographs , including the @entity166 , the only @entity53 title to run pictures of @entity142 's brother @entity169 cavorting naked in a @entity171 hotel last month			0
mr @entity14 , editor of the @entity3 , sought to defend his decision as his future looked increasingly in doubt			2
‘ @entity176 would be no different to any other celeb pics we would get in , for example @entity180 or @entity181 , ’ he said			0
‘ she ’s not the future queen of @entity8 so the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the @entity53 , and they are very , very tasteful pictures			0
’ the @entity3 did not refer in today 's edition to the decision to re-run pages from @entity191 magazine closer , the first to publish the images			0
but it did carry photographs and a story about the latest stage of the @entity197 and @entity176 of @entity199 's trip to the @entity150			0
fun : while the storm over the topless photographs of @entity7 continued to rage elsewhere , they spent the day smiling and joking as they scaled a giant tree in their stride : @entity142 and @entity7 stroll along a canopy bridge in the rainforest determined not to let the embarrassment derail their foreign tour @entity8 's @entity214 said at the weekend that no complaints had been made to its office over the @entity3			1
the office does not normally discuss complaints before investigations have been completed			0
an investigation by the newspaper 's @entity8 - based shareholder , @entity90 ( @entity90 ) , is being launched although it has already warned that it viewed publication as a ' poor editorial decision '			1
@entity227 mp @entity226 , a member of the @entity228 ’ @entity225 , said : ' publishing these pictures in @entity8 was totally unacceptable			0
' newspaper owners should act responsibly			0
@entity49 may say he did n’t know about all this but is it right for such a proprietor to continue to own a @entity53 newspaper after this ? i ’m not convinced it is			0
