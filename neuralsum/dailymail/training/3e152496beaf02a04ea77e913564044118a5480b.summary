a family has been forced out of their home for @entity3 after their pet @entity6 set fire to the kitchen by turning on the hob with her paw			1
ten - month - old muffin was home alone when she accidentally ignited a flame as she jumped around the kitchen top			1
as clothing near the electric oven caught fire , the ground floor went up in flames and @entity12 was left barking for her life			1
@entity21 , 33 , from @entity22 , left muffin home alone for a morning and came back to a blackened kitchen shock : ms @entity21 said her children , @entity27 , 11 , and @entity28 , 7 , are devastated two days before @entity3 hearing the alarms and cries , the next - door neighbour to the semi-detached home in @entity34 , @entity35 , called the emergency services , stopping the blaze from spreading further			1
firefighters forced their way into the property and rescued @entity12 at around 10.30am on saturday , arriving within a minute of the neighbour 's call			1
despite tackling the flames immediately , the kitchen is wrecked , all the doors will need to be replaced and the walls are black with smoke			2
today homeowner @entity21 , 33 , who was at work at the time , said she and her two children are devastated as they will not be home for @entity3			1
she said : ' it has ruined @entity3 a bit because i wanted to have it at home with my kids with all our own decorations up			1
but i ’m just trying not to let it get to me for the kids ’ sake			0
still learning : as she is just a puppy , the family hope muffin will grow out of her hyperactiveness			2
but failing that , ms @entity21 admitted she may concede to buying some sort of cage ' when i told them @entity12 had started the fire they were devastated because they love her to pieces			1
i just had to tell them that she did n’t mean to do it			0
' luckily the family ’s presents were not damaged in the fire but any hopes of @entity3 dinner at home have been dashed			1
ms @entity21 and her children @entity27 , 11 , and @entity28 , 7 , will have to go to her parents , where @entity12 is already causing havoc			1
' they are n’t used to the dog			0
she ’s a barker , ' she said			0
' but she has been very quiet since the fire - i thought maybe she was embarrassed			2
but then yesterday she woke my mum up at 6am so she ’s back to her old ways			0
' muffin suffered smoke inhalation and was seen by a vet but is now back to full fitness			2
despite the damage , ms @entity21 says her feelings for @entity12 are still the same , though she may consider new ways of controlling her behaviour			1
the firefighters arrived at 10.30am on saturday and managed to prevent the fire from spreading , and saved @entity12 she said : ' muffin is a mischievous dog and she ’s very feisty			1
she can be boisterous at times but she ’s still young so she ’s still learning			0
' she ’s our first dog and we ’ve only had her since april			0
i ’ll definitely think twice about leaving her in the house alone from now on			2
i might even have to get her a cage which i do n’t want to do but i ca n’t risk anything like this happening again			0
' when my neighbour rang me up and told me there was a fire at the house i just wanted to know if the dog was alright			1
i was n’t angry with the dog , i was just so worried			0
' apparently she ran upstairs and hid in the bedroom			0
she must have been so scared			0
i ’m obviously devastated about the damage but there ’s nothing i can do now - you just have to get on with it			0
' i still love the dog to pieces but i never thought she could do anything like that			0
it ’s definitely made me more wary			0
i ’m just pleased the kids were at my mum ’s and my neighbour was in			2
although we ca n’t live in the house at the moment because it ’s still really smoky			2
