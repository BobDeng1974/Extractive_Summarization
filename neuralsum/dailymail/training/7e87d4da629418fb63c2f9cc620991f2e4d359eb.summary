the @entity0 have been urged by one of their own clubs to take the lead on slashing ticket prices for hard - up supporters by encouraging every top - flight team to reduce admission fees			1
@entity9 vice-chairman @entity8 said he would like to cut huge amounts off all ticket prices for @entity13 ’s fans , including season tickets , and believes other clubs could do the same due to the £ 5.5billion of tv riches pouring into the @entity0 in the current three - year tv deal ‘ cycle ’			1
but he says if @entity9 - a family - friendly club co-owned by fans - go it alone on price reductions , they would put themselves at a competitive disadvantage			2
