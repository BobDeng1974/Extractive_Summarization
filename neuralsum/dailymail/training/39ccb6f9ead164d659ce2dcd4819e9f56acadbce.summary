click here to see our brilliant @entity1 including a pitch map of @entity6 's match - winning performance it was n't @entity8 , @entity9 or even @entity10 that stole the show in @entity14 's first @entity13 but @entity15 's @entity6			1
goals either side of half - time from the 29 - year - old , who was fairly absent for much of the game , made it three wins from three for @entity23 without conceding			0
much of the match build - up was centred on @entity14 's pollution but thanks to a breezy saturday afternoon it had all but cleared up in time for kick - off with levels dropping from ' hazardous ' to ' moderate '			1

saturday 's meeting was a friendly but that 's hardly the appropriate word for this rivalry			2
since 1914 there have been 95 meetings between the two nations with results almost even , @entity39 on 36 victories , @entity23 with 35 and 24 matches finishing in a draw			2
@entity39 had won all but one game in the last 10 - that being their @entity134 final loss to @entity135 - while @entity23 's poor campaign saw them come under intense scrutiny following a 7 - 1 loss to the @entity139			1
the tables had turned somewhat for @entity23 with back - to - back 1 - 0 wins over @entity142 and @entity143 but the jury was still out			1
@entity146 fans had plenty to be happy about in the opening 10 minutes with @entity149 man @entity109 getting in on goal after just 15 seconds and @entity8 introducing himself with a couple of darting runs much to the delight of the @entity155 fans			0
@entity39 continued to knock on the door with @entity108 and @entity109 again creating but their finishing let them down			0
totally against the run of play though , @entity159 forward @entity6 capitalised on some bad defending from @entity100 and @entity99 to smash a volley home across @entity53 and give @entity23 the lead on 28 minutes			1
@entity6 had been a doubt before the game with an eye injury but his finish opened his international account in style			0
@entity6 was a peripheral figure for much of the game but popped up with both goals			0
see his pitch map in our brilliant @entity1 @entity6 did n't see much of the ball but when he did he made it count and grabbed two goals from inside the area here is @entity8 's heatmap from the friendly , showing a strong attacking presence for @entity39 @entity9 , heatmap above , was key to @entity23 's forward play , particularly on the left and down the centre @entity81 posted this picture of himself and @entity9 celebrating @entity23 's win in their dressing room after the match @entity8 , far right , takes a free kick as @entity23 's players , from left , @entity64 , @entity80 , @entity84 , @entity6 , and @entity79 defend their goal @entity23 's @entity9 ( r ) fights for the ball with @entity39 's @entity99 ( c ) and @entity106 during the friendly match @entity109 ( left ) tries to get the better of @entity81 ( right ) as @entity39 slumped to a disappointing defeat in @entity14 @entity9 followed up by destroying the @entity39 defence , the @entity76 star getting past @entity105 and leaving him in his wake before easing past @entity100 but he could n't finish the chance			1
with @entity39 suddenly on the back foot , @entity64 was outpaced by @entity202 's @entity108 who was brought down in the box just five minutes before the break			2
the stage was set for @entity8 but the talismanic playmaker missed the opportunity to level matters as he hit a poor penalty which @entity69 palmed away			2
@entity9 ( r ) , @entity81 ( @entity210 ) , @entity101 ( second from left ) and @entity99 keep their eyes on the ball in @entity14 @entity39 's @entity103 gets beyond @entity84 as @entity9 watches on at the @entity63 @entity23 keeper @entity69 flings himself to his right to make a save during his team 's 2 - 0 win against @entity39 on saturday @entity23 , clearly buoyed by their half - time lead , started much brighter			1
@entity220 full - back @entity82 hit a great chance over the bar before @entity9 caused problems for @entity39			0
@entity85 also went close before @entity6 got in on the act again with his second on 64 minutes - the corner came in and from the flick - on @entity6 nodded the ball home to double @entity23 's advantage			1
@entity39 continued to try and find a way back into the game but @entity23 looked as if they might have scored more			0
@entity10 was introduced in the latter stages to a massive reaction from the @entity155 fans , with one getting so excited he followed his hero onto the pitch only to be swiftly removed .			0

@entity33 's @entity23 beat @entity241 rivals @entity39 2 - 0 in saturday 's friendly match in @entity14
@entity15 striker @entity6 put @entity23 ahead against the run of play after 28 minutes
@entity8 has a penalty saved by @entity69 in the 41st minute after @entity248 was *fouled* in the box
@entity6 doubled @entity23 's lead when he nodded home his second of the match with 64 minutes gone
@entity10 was treated to an *excellent* *reception* when he came on as a substitute after 82 minutes
