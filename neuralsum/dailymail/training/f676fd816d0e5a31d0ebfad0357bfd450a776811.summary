by @entity0 published : 20:04 est , 16 april 2012 updated : 20:06 est , 16 april 2012 comments : sir @entity3 's attack on the inquiry is the strongest yet the @entity6 inquiry has become a mixture of ‘ show trial , seminar and truth commission ’ , according to a former ambassador			1
sir @entity3 said there was a ‘ whiff of totalitarianism ’ about the inquiry into press standards and warned of the dangers of censoring newspapers			1
the attack from the former head of the @entity21 is the strongest so far from an influential name outside the newspaper trade			2
he said the tribunal ’s remit was too ambitious and suggested that @entity6 had already made up his mind to abolish the @entity21 and replace it with a new system of regulation			2
the inquiry , set up by @entity30 last july in the wake of allegations that the @entity33 hacked into the phone messages of murder victim @entity35 , is charged with examining the culture , practices and ethics of the press			2
sir @entity3 , who served as @entity43 ambassador in @entity44 , said : ‘ is there any proposal for press regulation which has come before @entity6 , short of appointing a commissar in every news room with x-ray eyes and telepathic powers , that would have nipped phone - hacking in the bud ? ’ in a speech to the @entity55 he said : ‘ the @entity6 inquiry , with its elements of show trial , seminar and truth commission , is a curious beast			1
‘ it runs in parallel with at least three police investigations looking into similar matters			0
no wonder there are anxieties among the police and those arrested that the proceedings of the inquiry might damage or prejudice their respective interests			2
’ evidence : @entity75 appears before the @entity77 inquiry into phone hacking for a second time last november the @entity21 strengthened its rules for journalists after two @entity33 employees were jailed over phone hacking in 2007			2
but it did not uncover the extent of hacking at the newspaper			0
in a speech to the @entity87 sir @entity3 said that the @entity21 ‘ has been roundly and wrongly condemned ’ for not having police powers to investigate wrongdoing			1
but he said such powers would amount to ‘ utterly objectionable ’ state regulation			0
sir @entity3 said : ‘ as a formal judicial inquiry , it eclipses in legal standing the unfinished @entity95 into the origins and conduct of the @entity98 , a much more important subject			1
’ sir @entity3 said @entity6 ( pictured ) had made it ' pretty clear ' that something new is coming he added that @entity6 ‘ has made it pretty clear that something new is coming ’ and that ‘ the fundamental premise of the proceedings is that the current system of regulation is broken , has lost the confidence of the public and needs to be replaced			1
’ the @entity21 gives satisfaction to more than 80 per cent of those who use it , sir @entity3 said			1
it should be strengthened , not abolished			0
but , sir @entity3 said , ‘ when i sought to make some of these points in @entity112 , i have to say that there was a glazing of the eye from the inquisitor , a flare of irritation from the bench			1
’ he added : ‘ we can not wish away the @entity121			0
after the expenditure of huge sums of public money , it will be expected to come up with a result , and that result will be a hugely important moment for our freedoms and for our democracy , already under multiple pressures			0
’ the inquiry had become a hot - house for debate about the media and society , sir @entity3 said			1
‘ a thousand flowers , and not a few weeds , bloom in the rich haul of witness statements			0
‘ here and there a whiff of totalitarianism arises from the foliage			2
some witnesses appear animated by the idea that here is such a thing as truth with a capital t. there may well be , but we humans have only the most partial and imperfect access to it			0
in reality we live in a world of fiercely competing ideas and “ truths ”			0
’ sir @entity3 said that one of the great strengths of @entity43 democracy was the ‘ campaigning partisanship of its newspapers ’			1
he advised @entity6 : ‘ beware those who , flying the flag of objectivity , want to impose their version of the truth			0
that would cast open the door to the enemies of the open society			0

sir @entity3 *claimed* there was a ' whiff of totalitarianism ' about the inquiry into press standards
