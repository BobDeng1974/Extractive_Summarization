when it was announced that @entity2 was joining @entity3 from @entity4 of the @entity5 in november , the news was largely overshadowed by the club ’s interest in another striker			1
@entity9 may have a vaguely similar name to the teenager , but the circumstances surrounding the two players could not have been more different			1
while @entity3 were forced to abandon plans to offer @entity9 a route back into football following his release from prison amid a blaze of bad publicity , @entity2 slipped quietly into @entity21 on a two - year - deal			1
@entity2 spearheaded a fightback from @entity3 that nearly took them to the @entity25 final @entity2 arrival went largey unnoticed as @entity3 were being criticised for reports linking them with @entity9 @entity29 's side were moments away from taking the tie with @entity32 into extra time everyone will know who he is this morning , though , after the 18 - year - old so nearly turned the second leg of this @entity25 semi-final on its head last night			1
ultimately , @entity32 booked their place at @entity41 , but the @entity43 club were left rocking on their heels by the introduction of @entity2 in place of @entity47 in the 74th minute			1
his two coolly taken goals in the space of just 140 seconds put the @entity52 level on aggregate and on course for extra-time until @entity56 broke their hearts with his second goal of the night			2
it was a stunning performance from the youngster , even if his manager @entity29 was less than impressed with his goal celebration			2
‘ he ’s got to learn not to slide in the corner and celebrate when we ’ve still got to get another goal ! ’ said @entity29			2
‘ get the ball out of the net and get back to the centre - spot and we can go again			1
‘ hopefully we ’ll be talking about him for the next few years			0
we ’ve been delighted since he ’s come in			0
just a few months ago he was playing a few leagues down			0
‘ we like the look of him			0
he ’s still quite raw , only 18 years old , but he ’s got a lot of potential			1
‘ he ’s cup - tied in the @entity78 but he ’ll get plenty of chances in the league now			1
’ @entity2 celebrates scoring his first goal for @entity29 's side against @entity32 @entity56 ( right ) scores the winner for @entity32 in the closing minutes of the game @entity86 ( left ) celebrates reaching the cup final with two - goal hero @entity56 ( right ) @entity2 made his debut for @entity3 when they upset @entity89 in this competition here last month – one of five @entity43 victims beaten by @entity29 ’s side in the cup competitions since he took over at @entity21 15 months ago			1
towards the end of his time at @entity4 , 45 scouts turned up at the club ’s @entity98 to see a young man who was earning a burgeoning reputation for his blistering pace			0
but @entity29 beat off competition from @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106 to sign him for a nominal fee and the promise of a friendly against the @entity111 side			2
@entity2 , who has been approached by @entity112 to represent them internationally , played for @entity114 as a youngster			1
a boyhood @entity117 fan , last night ’s exploits meant even more to him			2
‘ it ’s been a really good night for me , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s horrible losing but it ’s a good team that we lost to and hopefully they can win it now			0
‘ there were n’t really any nerves tonight			0
a lot of people dream of doing that and fortunately i can			0
‘ the manager did n’t really say anything when he sent me on but he knows what i can do and i showed him			0
he just wanted me to go back to the halfway line after the goal			0
it got to my head and i did n’t know want to do			0
’ being cup - tied means that @entity2 will not be eligible to face @entity137 in the fifth round of the @entity78 if @entity140 ’s side beat @entity141 in their replay and @entity3 overcome @entity143			1
@entity144 ( left ) and @entity2 ( right ) clap @entity3 supporters after the game against @entity32 @entity2 shoots past the @entity32 defence and gets his second goal of the game at @entity21 an @entity56 free kick handed @entity32 the lead in the first half in spectacular style given the opportunity , you would not rule out @entity29 ’s side producing another shock after last night ’s efforts			1
‘ at half - time just told players to go for one and see what would happen , ’ said the manager			2
‘ if they had played us off the park for two games and beat us easily , we would hold up our hands but losing after being so close just makes it worse			2
‘ now have a game against @entity143 to try to get a tie against @entity137 here , so that is the objective			0

@entity2 signed when @entity3 were linked with @entity9
the *uproar* meant @entity2 's arrival at @entity21 was unnoticed
but @entity3 beat a host of clubs to land the impressive 18 - year - old
