@entity0 has deferred a decision on its next course of action in relation to the kick - off time of february 's @entity7 derby			1

after the fixture was moved in order to be televised by @entity18 , the police elevated the match to a @entity21 fixture , with reference to there being a high risk of disorder			0
@entity26 and @entity0 are due to kick - off at 5.30pm at @entity14 in february 's @entity7 derby @entity0 's @entity27 ( right ) has an effort at goal during his side 's 1 - 1 draw with @entity26 in september they want the match to start earlier and although the council 's licensing committee support that stance it wants further investigation of its options to be made before it makes a definitive decision			1
" @entity12 do not support this fixture being played at 1730 on saturday february 7 2015 and reiterate our position that this fixture should have a kick - off time of no later than 1.30pm on a weekend , " said the police in a report to a special meeting of the ground safety advisory committee			1
@entity26 informed the @entity11 on december 9 of the police 's objections and the issue was discussed on tuesday by the council 's licensing committee , who initially said it would " take legal advice on all appropriate options to enforce the position " in the event of no change of kick - off time being determined			1
