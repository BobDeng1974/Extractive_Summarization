a woman lost her happily ever after on @entity2 after she answered the names of @entity5 's seven dwarfs incorrectly , although she appeared fully confident with her answer			1
the category was characters , and she only had six letters missing from a 41 - letter , eight - word puzzle			1
when it came her turn to solve it , she - incorrectly - named the @entity5 's seven dwarfs as @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity14 , @entity14 , @entity17 and @entity14			2
the category for the round was ' characters ' , and it appeared that the letters in the puzzle were forming the names of @entity5 's seven dwarfs she even already had more than half of ' @entity24 ' filled in , only missing the z , which means she would have spelled ' sneaky ' incorrectly in her final answer			1
the audience gasped at her wrong answer , and host @entity29 turns to her to say , ' i 'm sorry			0
@entity32 it 's your turn			0
' @entity32 knew the answer and confidently says ' dopey , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity14 , @entity14 , @entity35 and @entity14 '			0
he even paused dramatically before saying ' @entity24 '			2
when the contestant ( center ) says ' sneaky ' instead of ' @entity24 ' she loses her chance and @entity32 , the contestant to her right , takes the win by saying the names of all seven dwarfs contestant @entity32 correctly named all seven dwarfs : dopey , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity14 , @entity14 , @entity35 and @entity14 this comes less than a month after a contestant made headlines for a remarkable correct guess at a two - word , 17 - letter , puzzle using only one letter			1
with only the letter on the board - t - in the category of ' event ' , the contestant named @entity53 managed to correctly solve the puzzle within seconds			2
his response was greeted with a huge round of applause , while even @entity29 appeared shocked			0
his remarkable guess bumped his prize money up from $ 1,700 to $ 7,100 and earned him a handshake from a very impressed @entity29 .			0

a woman on @entity2 had only six letters missing from a 41 - letter , eight - word puzzle in the category of ' characters '
the puzzle appeared to be the names of @entity5 's seven dwarfs
she named six correctly , but said ' @entity78 ' instead of ' @entity24 ' , even though she had both letter ' e 's in ' sneezy ' on the board
the next contestant *quickly* and confidently named all seven dwarfs
