frolicking in his new home , @entity1 ’s only polar bear is a picture of contentment			1
but moving the 75 - stone animal from a @entity8 zoo to this purpose - built enclosure was a tricky proposition – not least for @entity11 himself			1
with his breeding days behind him , the 15 - year - old was picked to be the first occupant of an £ 850,000 facility at the @entity17 , near @entity18 , complete with an eight - metre - deep lake and swathes of grassland , designed to resemble the @entity23 tundra in the summer			1
after being trained to walk into the cage , he was loaded on to a lorry and then ferried to @entity38 from the port of @entity40 , receiving fish and water through the bars along the way			0
his new keepers were relieved that upon his arrival on thursday they were met by a ‘ very confident ’ and ‘ laid back ’ character – rather than a polar bear with a sore head			2
after spending the weekend in a holding area to give him time to adjust , @entity11 was finally let loose in his new home yesterday			2
he quickly settled in with a refreshing dip in the man - made lake , before a rest in one of the caves dug into a bank at the side of the water			0
his enclosure is one of the biggest in the world , and could hold up to ten more animals			0
@entity11 is expected to be joined by two others by the end of the year – but for now he has all ten acres to himself			2
@entity67 , the wildlife park ’s director , said : ‘ he is quite greedy and loves meat and fish , with his favourite being mackerel , but he is not very impressed by vegetables			0
i have been told he likes the occasional peanut butter sandwich but we have n’t tried that yet			0
' he weighs about 480kg ( 1058lbs ) so he is pretty chunky , but that is his summer weight			0
when it comes up to winter he will become a real hungry @entity79 and eat lots more , when it gets colder he will probably be about 500kg ( 1102lbs )			0
@entity11 has been retired to the @entity82 because he is no longer needed on a @entity84 polar bear breeding programme , as he is the father of most of the continent 's bears smile ! @entity11 looks up as a photographer takes a picture of him in the hours before he leaves holland @entity11 travelled with his keeper at the @entity92 , @entity28 , who will stay with him for his first few days in @entity32 to help him get used to his new climate the 15 - year - old polar bear shows off his teeth as he walks through the cage he was transported in on his journey to @entity82 @entity11 looked confused as to what the digger was before it was used to pick up his cage and place it in a waiting lorry icy : ice cubes are left in buckets near @entity11 's cage to help him stay cool during the journey to @entity1 @entity108 ( pictured ) , @entity11 's @entity8 keeper , travelled with him to keep him company on the journey @entity11 , who retired from a breeding programme after fathering ten cubs , is the first polar bear to live in @entity1 for about a decade			1
he was born in captivity in @entity115 , @entity116 , before moving to @entity117 in the @entity8			0
his new keepers hope to use their enclosure to re-home bears living in unsuitable homes in @entity122 or tropical countries			2
the animal , who is such a prolific breeder that he had to be retired because he is father to most of @entity122 's polar bears , now lives in a 10 - acre enclosure which has the environment of an @entity23 summer			1
park director @entity130 said : ' we are delighted to welcome @entity11 to the park and be able to make a contribution to polar bear conservation			1
' @entity11 has made a great contribution to the @entity84 breeding programme and his genes are very well represented now so the decision was made to retire him to the park			1
@entity11 was driven to a ferry port in @entity28 so he could begin his journey to @entity1			1
he is now the only captive polar bear in the country arriving : the giant polar bear is taken off the lorry after getting to @entity18			1
now the keepers have to transport into his enclosure can i get out now ? the bear appeared eager to be freed from his cage as he arrived at the @entity17 after a length journey by ferry from the @entity8 let me out : @entity11 was eager to get out and explore his new home , which includes 8m deep lakes and a realistic @entity23 summer climate feeling trapped : after a 12 - hour journey locked inside the cramped metal cage , the polar bear was let out to meet his new friends who described him as ' very confident ' a jcb was used to haul the 1,058lb bear to his new 10 - acre enclosure , which has been dubbed @entity165 because of its @entity23 conditions ' he 's actually the most prolific breeder across @entity122 , so most polar bears in @entity122 are probably his children			1
' so because of that he 's now been retired from the breeding programme and we offered him a home as we 've just built this specialist enclosure which is the biggest in @entity122 at the moment			1
' ' but that does n't stop @entity11 from being an ambassador for the @entity23			2
polar bears are an iconic species that are increasingly threatened in their native habitat and we need to fight their cause			2
the park expect @entity11 to live for anotjer 15 years at least , but he will not be lonely for long as more bears are expected to join him soon			1
' we will have more bears arriving in the autumn and will announce those as soon as details are finalised , ' mr @entity130 added			2
because i 'm worth it : @entity11 had no problem with playing up to the cameras at his unveiling in @entity32 in thursday drying off : the retired polar bear looks more like a large dog as he shakes the water off his fur @entity11 takes a dip in the lake before heading to one of his rocky caves , which provides shelter for the bear as well as his main house @entity202 : fish were on the menu shortly after @entity11 arrived			1
park officials say it only took him 10 minutes to settle into his new home hungry : @entity1 's only polar bear uses a paw to hold down a chunk of meat as he gnaws at his lunch enjoying retirement ? @entity11 wanders around his 8m deep lake where he will spend his retirement			1
he had to leave his role as @entity122 's top breeder because too many of the continent 's bears are his children going for an explore : the polar bear enclosure features landscaped hills , valleys , and large lakes , and will be big enough for any more bears the park takes on and if @entity11 is anything to go by , the other polar bears will settle in fine at the large enclosure , dubbed @entity165 , which features landscaped hills , valleys , and lakes with water up to 8m deep			1
within 10 minutes of arriving he was seen in his house , eating food and having a drink ' like he had been here all his life ' , mr @entity130 said			0
he will be kept of out of the public gaze while he acclimatises to @entity82 temperatures , but will be able to explore his new home			0
mr @entity130 explained what @entity165 includes : ' the landscaping of the reserves mirror the @entity244 with grass , herbs , shrubs and heathers			0
there are rocky areas and caves , which provide shelter for the bears as well as their main house			0
' the large lake is 8m deep so @entity11 will be able to swim and dive			1
we are sure that @entity11 will enjoy his new surroundings			0
' taking a dip : park officials say @entity11 has enjoyed taking long swims in the lakes in @entity165 and is often seen in the water hello there : @entity11 wanders towards photographers taking snaps of him			1
he will not get to meet the public properly until he has aclimmatised to the park home , sweet home : @entity17 will be moving in more bears in the autumn but have not released any further details yet close enough : a cameraman records @entity11 as he tucks into some lunch , but stays at a safe distance from the large carnivore tucking in : within 10 minutes of arriving , @entity11 was seen in his house , eating food and having a drink ' like he had been here all his life ' , park director @entity130 said fluffy but fierce : despite their cute and cuddly appearance , polar bears are some of the strongest animals on the planet last year @entity17 offered a home to @entity287 , a polar bear trapped in soaring temperatures and a concrete enclosure in a @entity292 zoo			1
@entity293 has been at @entity294 since 1992 , after being captured in the wild as a cub			0
her current concrete enclosure has virtually no shade , and offers little stimulation , causing campaigners to encourage the zoo to move her to a more appropriate home			0
the @entity18 park made an offer to rehouse @entity306 , but it is yet to be accepted			2
ms @entity67 said : ' we would still be delighted to re-home @entity293 , who is over twenty years old			0
it would be wonderful if she could enjoy the rest of her life in the reserve here , so we wait for further news from @entity315			0
' there are two other polar bears in @entity82 , who both live at @entity320 in @entity321			2
one of them , called @entity323 , is one of @entity11 's many sons .			0

@entity11 , a 1,058lb polar bear , has become @entity1 's only polar bear after moving to @entity18 from @entity28
the 15 - year - old was retired from a breeding programme because he is father to nearly all of @entity122 's polar bears
he has moved into a 10 - acre park in @entity17 , which includes 8m deep lakes and an @entity23 climate
more polar bears will be arriving to give him some company over the next few *months* , park officials say
