scientists have captured the first ever video footage of one of the least known and most elusive wild cats on earth			0
the african golden cat was recorded by a camera trap hunting during daylight in @entity8 , @entity9			1
this new footage shows an african golden cat hunting red colobus monkeys gathered around and feeding on the dead wood of a tree stump			1
this new footage shows an african golden cat hunting red colobus monkey			1
it attacks a group of red colobus monkey gathered around a tree stump , causing them to scatter ( left image ) leaping in from the left ( middle ) before fighting with one			1
eventually , it retreats , leaping back over the log to make its escape ( right )			0
the @entity29 golden cat is found only in the forests of @entity31 and @entity32 , and grows to the size of a bobcat , weighing between 5 - 16 kilograms			2
very few western scientists have observed the living animal in the wild and almost all records of the @entity15 consist of photographs taken by remote camera traps , or of dead animals ( usually killed by local hunters )			0
the forest - dwelling species is threatened across its range by intensive bushmeat hunting ( the hunting of wild animals for meat ) and loss of habitat due to deforestation			0
it was recorded with a camera trap set by @entity54 , @entity8 project manager for the @entity56 's @entity55 : the @entity57 , in collaboration with the @entity59 , @entity60 and the @entity61			0
' it is an exciting and rare glimpse into the world of this fascinating cat , ' said @entity67 scholar and graduate student , @entity68			0
' we know a lot more about golden cats than we did a few years ago and yet we still know almost nothing about their behaviour			0
' primatologists in @entity8 have observed monkeys emitting alarm calls at golden cats on several occasions and , considering this latest evidence , it 's not hard to see why			2
' @entity83 and graduate student , @entity82 , said , ' an adult red colobus monkey is a considerable opponent for an african golden cat			1
' with the golden cat failing to make a fatal bite immediately on ambush , it had to make a hasty retreat			2
' ' watching a golden cat in full ambush of large monkeys in this video provides hunting details we could previously only piece together from brief sightings			1
' it also portrays nicely why monkeys might mob a golden cat , as can be seen in the unique footage of a golden cat trying in vain to catch a cat nap while precariously perched in the fork of a tree			1
' further footage , this time of a golden cat sleeping in a tree , has been recorded by @entity110 of the @entity111 at @entity112			1
the video was recorded in the @entity114 , @entity9 , and shows monkeys surrounding the golden cat and harassing it until it descends from the tree			1
the @entity29 golden cat is found only in the forests of @entity31 and @entity32 , and grows to the size of a bobcat , weighing between 5 - 16 kilograms			2

the forest - dwelling species is threatened across its range by intensive bushmeat hunting a recently published review paper on @entity29 golden cats summarises the current state of knowledge of the species and provides preliminary results from two studies supported by @entity140 , a global wild cat conservation organization			0
today , this forest - dwelling species is threatened across its range by intensive bushmeat hunting ( the hunting of wild animals for meat ) and loss of habitat due to deforestation			0
