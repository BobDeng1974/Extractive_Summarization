many christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services , a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos - but a group of vicars say it can lead to discrimination against the poor but the clergymen said affluent parents were more likely to cheat the system by going to church just to get their children into a @entity3 school , which are often high - performing			1
in an open letter published yesterday , an alliance of left - leaning clergy and laypeople called for an end to religious selection			0
they claimed the @entity3 was being ‘ turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged ’ , and said it presented a ‘ slow - burning crisis ’			2
the comments , made in a letter to @entity46 , sparked anger from the @entity3 , which labelled their arguments ‘ doctrinaire ’			0

they said the level of false @entity3 attendance rose to 10 per cent among affluent parents in the @entity93 the letter said : ‘ on a superficial level this is in the @entity3 ’s interest , as attendance figures in many parishes are inflated and the standard of our schools boosted by the admittance of children from more affluent families			1
‘ ultimately however the universality of the @entity3 is being turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged			0
we believe this issue presents a slow - burning crisis			0
