by @entity0 different managers and a different league			0
but this was the same old @entity4 derby			0
a windswept , blood and thunder affair best viewed through the cracks of the fingers , it finished as most of them do			0
with red cards and a @entity14 win			2
the victorious coach @entity15 came closest to the truth when he claimed afterwards : ‘ @entity17 broke out a little bit			0
’ he was being generous			0
@entity20 captain @entity19 missed a penalty which proved the forerunner to another day of derby misery and recrimination for the @entity26 club and their captain			1
prince of @entity4 : @entity29 celebrates after scoring the decisive goal from the penalty spot in second half taking a tumble : @entity29 was caught by @entity20 defender @entity34 , who received a second yellow card marching orders : referee @entity37 brandishes a red card after @entity34 's second bookable offence cool customer : @entity29 strokes his spot - kick home to put @entity14 2 - 0 up with 10 minutes left to play they were edging closer to a point when , from nowhere , @entity14 attacker @entity45 smashed a superb 25 - yard strike into the top corner of the net in 75 minutes			1
three minutes later the visitors , in their white away shirts , surrendered any hope of a result when @entity34 earned a second booking for pushing over @entity29 in the penalty area			1
the midfielder picked himself up to smash the ball high into the net from 12 yards for 2 - 0 , condemning @entity59 and his 10 men to a seemingly inevitable fate			1
it all got too much for some			0
@entity63 was red carded for a mid-air elbow on @entity65 and according to the defender , it was n’t his first either			1
@entity20 were also incensed with @entity14 sub @entity68 escaped an alleged headbutt on @entity20 defender @entity71 moments after @entity72 had pulled a goal back for @entity20			1
stunning opener : @entity45 unleashed an unstoppable shot from distance to put @entity14 ahead raucous : @entity45 , left , is mobbed by his team - mates after his long - range strike found the back of the net @entity26 skipper @entity19 wo n’t look back on his day with any sense of pride			1
it began badly with his dragged penalty scraping the outside of the post on its way past and ended with the midfielder being frogmarched down the tunnel for his own protection by a club official , red hair flaming with anger as he sought an old fashioned ‘ square go ’ with @entity68			1
had he mustered even half as much bravado for his penalty kick in 31 minutes @entity20 might have taken something from this			1
yet @entity59 refused afterwards to blame the missed penalty for his team ’s defeat			2
‘ the penalty miss came when the game was 0 - 0 so i do n’t think we can look back and say we lost the game because of it , ’ said the @entity20 boss			1
wasteful : @entity20 captain @entity19 skews his penalty wide with the scoreline at 0 - 0 in the first half in the wars : @entity20 defender @entity65 , second right , receives treatment to a facial injury winning coach : @entity14 boss @entity15 gestures to his side during their 2 - 1 win at @entity120 that it was a key moment , however , is undeniable			1
@entity14 ’ stand - in no 1 @entity122 – the 20 - year - old third - choice keeper – was cast into the fire after @entity126 shattered his cheekbone against @entity128 last week and no 2 @entity129 twisted his ankle			2
he was doing fine until @entity72 ’s header landed in the no - man ’s land and forced him to rush from his line as @entity20 attacker @entity134 tried to muscle in			1
@entity122 appeared to get a hand on the ball before clattering into handling , but referee @entity37 – a constant source of irritation to the @entity14 fans – awarded a soft spot - kick			1
to a chorus of boos and cheers , @entity19 ’s run up was confident			0
but his low , sclaffed , left - foot effort looked horrible from the moment it left his foot , skidding hopelessly wide of @entity122 ’s post			0
for @entity20 , a club which seems cursed in this fixture , it was happening again			0
emboldened by their penalty let - off , @entity14 , on the other hand , were working up a head of steam			2
feisty affair : @entity63 fends off a challenge from @entity65 during the second half in @entity4 you reap what you sow : @entity63 and @entity164 , right , clash as the @entity14 striker is sent off tempers flare : @entity20 captain @entity19 exchanges angry words with @entity14 defender @entity169 @entity45 , a fine prospect at 19 , had a terrific chance with a snap shot in 38 minutes after some persistent @entity14 pressure from a corner			1
a goal looked more likely than not until @entity20 keeper @entity176 threw himself to the ground to make a fine save			2
when @entity181 ’s controlled right - footed half volley in injury time soared just wide of @entity176 ’s post , the half - time whistle was timely for @entity20			2
the second half threatened to break a new record for free - kicks			0
it was bitty , scratchy and devoid of finesse , a cavalcade of blocks , thumping , sliding challenges and bookings			0
with 15 minutes to play , it was edging grimly towards a scoreless draw and deserved nothing more			2
but @entity45 , a lifelong @entity14 fan , would be the first player to raise his head and make something happen			1
gathering the ball midway into the @entity20 half , he performed a sweet nutmeg before galloping forward and smashing an unstoppable shot into the corner of the net past @entity176 ’s despairing lunge			0
and the gathering storm intensified within three minutes when @entity20 midfielder @entity34 , booked before half - time , hauled down @entity29 in the area , earning a red card			1
‘ i had no qualms about the penalty , ’ said @entity59 after the game			0
‘ if you put two hands on someone and push them , you ca n’t expect not to get a penalty against you			0
consolation goal : @entity72 fires in for @entity20 in added time at the end of the game to make it 2 - 1 ‘ i ’m not going to hide behind any decisions when they are what they are			1
i think it was very easy for the referee to give it			0
he gave us one , which i think was a penalty but he missed one or two things today			0
’ no one missed the ball nestling high in the net – in the same corner @entity19 had gone for			2
for the fifth time in six derbies , @entity20 were heading for defeat			0
at least under @entity59 their defeats come with a measure of defiance			0
@entity63 , the @entity14 matchwinner and hero against @entity128 last sunday , was red carded for catching @entity65 with his elbow in mid-air			1
afterwards the @entity20 man , a cut visible above his right eye , said it came 70 minutes after an identical first offence which went unpunished			0
delighted : @entity14 youngster @entity122 celebrates at the final whistle after impressing in goal for the hosts with both teams down to 10 men , @entity20 rallied			1
@entity254 ’s header right in front of goal from a @entity19 free - kick was well saved by @entity122			1
but the young keeper could do nothing about a well - taken strike from the no 9 in injury time			0
too little , too late perhaps			0
the goal did nothing to improve the @entity20 mood or darken that of @entity14 as the final whistle prompted familiar scenes of bedlam			2
@entity19 was physically pushed down the tunnel for his own protection as @entity14 revelled in the realisation that , after two @entity271 games , they have beaten their two major promotion rivals .			2

@entity20 captain @entity19 missed a penalty in the 38th minute at @entity120
@entity45 put hosts in front with long - range strike 15 minutes from the end
@entity34 was then sent off for @entity20 , after a foul on @entity29
@entity29 *dusted* himself down to score resulting spot - kick and make it 2 - 0
@entity14 striker @entity63 was shown red for elbowing @entity65
@entity14 sub @entity68 escaped an alleged headbutt on @entity20 defender @entity71 *shortly* after @entity72 scored for the visitors
