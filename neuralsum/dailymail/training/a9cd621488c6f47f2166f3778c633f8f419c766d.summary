by @entity0 mother : @entity2 , 38 , pictured leaving @entity4 @entity3 today , said she only left her son @entity5 , two , in the bath for five minutes a toddler drowned in a bath of scalding water because his mother fell asleep while high on a cocktail of drugs , a court has heard			1
@entity14 , two , had suffered horrific burns when he was found at his home in @entity17 , floating face - down in water thought to be @entity20			1
even after he was taken to hospital , his temperature was still a shockingly high @entity23			0
as soon as paramedics arrived at the scene they found him face - down in the water and discovered he was still hot to touch			1
his mother , @entity2 , 38 , told @entity29 she had only left @entity5 alone for five minutes , but @entity30 , prosecuting , said experts in pathology and forensic science have agreed he must have spent at least two hours in the water			1
and on the day of her son ’s death she had taken methadone , tramadol , her partner ’s diazepam , and the painkiller pregabalin			0
there were also traces of heroin , cocaine , and cannabis in her blood			1
miss @entity2 lived with @entity5 ’s father @entity50 and their children and had wanted the toddler to ' inhale steam ' to treat a chest infection , the court heard			1
@entity50 called 999 at 11.48pm on january 4 , last year and said his son was dead			0
the first paramedics arrived eight minutes later			0
the court was also told that @entity59 was arrested at @entity60 after @entity5 was pronounced dead , she tried to kick a support worker and was verbally abusive to the police			0
mr @entity63 said there were two estimates of the temperature of the bath water - that it was between @entity69 and @entity70 for several hours , or that the initial temperature was ' considerably higher ' and it had cooled to @entity72			2
the court heard the burns were caused after @entity5 had @entity59 had been prescribed methadone to treat her heroin addiction			1
but she had not been able to get her regular dose because it was ' lost in the system ' , the court heard			1
she was given an emergency dose on january 2 , but failed to collect her prescription the following day			0
cocktail of drugs : the court heard she had a number of substances in her system on the day of her son 's death , including heroin and cocaine the court heard pregabalin produces a ' euphoric ' effect and miss @entity2 described it as ' a popular drug on her estate ' , mr @entity63 said			1
she had tried and failed to get her doctor to prescribe it			0
mr @entity63 told the jury they could expect miss @entity2 to say she was unwell at the time , had not eaten much , was in pain from an abscess in her mouth , and after feeling dizzy was knocked unconscious when she collapsed against a radiator			2
but he said the prosecution did not accept that because her account had ' changed over time ' and been ' modified and appended ' when she was questioned about it			0
mr @entity63 said : ' a far more likely scenario is that she put @entity5 in the bath and , affected by drugs , fell asleep			0
hearing : the prosecution told @entity29 that the injuries the boy suffered suggested he was in the bath for at least two hours ' miss @entity2 deliberately took a cocktail of drugs during the day that would inevitably have an effect on her function , and as an experienced drug user , she well understood the dangers			1
we do not say that @entity5 was deliberately killed by his mother , @entity2			2
' we do not suggest she wanted him to die or to be injured in any way			0
we do suggest @entity5 ’s death was entirely avoidable and @entity2 was responsible for it			2
' miss @entity2 denies manslaughter between january 3 and january 6 , last year , and the trial continues			2

@entity14 , two , was found with horrific burns at his home in @entity17
he was discovered face - down in the water , only his back was not burnt
his mother @entity2 , 38 , claimed she only left him alone for five minutes
@entity143 , however , believe he was in the water for at least two hours
the heroin addict ' had not been able to get her regular dose of methadone '
she wanted him to ' inhale steam to try and treat a chest infection '
@entity29 also heard she had traces of heroin and cocaine in her blood
