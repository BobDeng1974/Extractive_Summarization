the television ad promoting four - night midweek breaks showed families with school - aged children taking part in various activities , with small print stating that the offer ‘ excludes school holidays ’			1
two viewers complained that the ad was irresponsible because it encouraged parents to take their children out of school during term time			1
banned : the television ad promoting four - night midweek breaks showed families with school - aged children taking part in various activities , with small print stating that the offer ' excludes school holidays ' @entity4 said it was the responsibility of parents to exercise judgment regarding their children , and there was nothing in the ad that encouraged them to take their children out of school during term times			1
the advertising clearance service @entity37 said the issue of taking children out of school during term time was the responsibility of parents , who would be aware that rules had recently been tightened to discourage the practice			2
the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) noted that many of the scenes in the ad featured families with school - aged children enjoying various activities			2
it said : ‘ we considered the emphasis of the ad was on a family break and that the overall impression was that families could take advantage of the advertised offer , which was not available at weekends or during school holidays			2
ruling : two viewers complained that the ad was irresponsible because it encouraged parents to take their children out of school during term time ‘ we also noted the final on - screen text stated ‘ your family			2
your time ’ , which we considered was likely to be an encouragement for parents to take up the offer			0
' it irresponsibly encouraged parents to take their children out of school ' @entity44 ‘ because the ad had focused on a family break to promote an offer which was available only during term time , we concluded it irresponsibly encouraged parents to take their children out of school			1
’ the @entity44 ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form , adding : ‘ we told @entity4 to avoid promoting family breaks which were available only during school term times			1
’ a @entity4 spokesman said : ‘ @entity4 has always adhered to the @entity44 processes and guidelines and the approach with this particular tv commercial was no different			2
response : @entity4 said it was the responsibility of parents to exercise judgment regarding their children , and there was nothing in the ad that encouraged them to take their children out of school during term times ‘ as with all previous tv commercials , it was cleared for transmission by the relevant regulatory broadcast authority			1
it is also our understanding that only two complaints were received regarding this ad			0
' we believe this ruling to be extremely harsh ' @entity4 ‘ our ad shows a number of families , with children of varying ages , enjoying some of the activities that are available at @entity4			0
' we do not believe the ad encourages parents to take their children out of school and it is very clear that the price displayed excludes school holidays			1
' this approach was taken based on a ruling by the @entity44 themselves			0
in our opinion , this @entity44 ruling represents a new interpretation of the guidelines			0
decision : the @entity44 ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form ' however , whilst we believe this ruling to be extremely harsh , we do of course take on board the @entity44 's comments and will continue to work within their guidelines			0
’ ' poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect ' @entity129 a @entity129 spokesman said : ‘ poor attendance at school can have a hugely damaging effect , and children who attend school regularly are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good gcses than those who are regularly absent			0
‘ we recognise the challenges facing parents and that 's why we are giving schools the flexibility to set their own term times so they can change term dates to ones that work for their pupils and families			0
many schools are already taking advantage of this			0

tv advert promoting midweek breaks said it ' excludes school holidays '
@entity44 says firm ' encouraged parents to take their children out of school '
but @entity4 says parents should exercise judgment over children
