a new report into the shooting down of flight @entity2 has concluded that the @entity5 military did supply separatists with a @entity8 missile launcher and their evidence also shows rebels were most likely to have been responsible for the atrocity			1
an online report called the @entity13 , which combines citizen journalist and social media accounts , used publicly available published and broadcast material plus eyewitness material , including satellite images			1
' there is strong evidence indicating that the @entity5 military provided separatists in eastern @entity23 with the @entity8 missile launcher filmed and photographed in eastern @entity23 on july 17 , ' the on - line report states			1
' there is undeniable evidence that separatists in @entity23 were in control of a @entity8 missile launcher on july 17th and transported it from @entity30 to @entity31 on a transporter			1
the same transporter with missile launcher is spotted on june 23 and then again july 19 ' the @entity8 missile launcher was unloaded in @entity31 approximately three hours before the downing of @entity2 and was later filmed minus one missile driving through separatist - controlled @entity47			1
' the report from the team , led by @entity52 journalist @entity51 , states that ' in the aftermath of the downing of @entity2 , photographs and videos were posted on social media sites claiming to show a @entity8 missile launcher in areas close to the @entity2 crash site '			1
' using a variety of tools and techniques , the @entity2 investigation team has been able to establish the exact location at which these images were recorded and the approximate time that many of the images were recorded			0
' based on this information , the investigation team has mapped the route of the @entity70 through separatist - controlled territory in eastern @entity23 on july 17th			1
' the @entity2 impact zone in the village of @entity75 , some 80 kilometres east of @entity30			0
@entity77 investigators gathered more human remains at the site in eastern @entity23 when they were allowed access once more on october 31 investigators from the @entity77 examine the site of the ill - fated @entity83 that was brought down near the village of @entity75 on july 17 the authors said that ' our investigation was made possible by the examination of open source material overlooked by other organisations '			2
it comes as @entity77 investigators reported that more human remains at the @entity2 crash site in @entity23 almost four months after the airliner was shot down over the war - torn country			2
an official from separatist authorities in the self - declared @entity98 , made the announcement but it 's unclear if they were of passengers on the doomed flight or of combatants who died in fighting that has taken place in the same area			0
the @entity111 flight from @entity112 en - route to @entity109 , was shot down over @entity23 on july 17			2
the author of the @entity115 report said that ' our investigation was made possible by the examination of open source material overlooked by other organisations '			0
@entity5 has repeatedly denied the claim and pointed the finger at @entity121 over the disaster			0
the @entity77 is leading the official probe into the downing of the @entity111 jet , in which all 298 on board , including 193 @entity77 nationals and 38 @entity128 , were killed			0
@entity77 prime minister @entity130 has admitted it 's unlikely all the victims ' remains will be recovered from the impact zone of flight @entity2 @entity128 and the @entity136 have accused @entity5 - backed rebels of shooting down @entity138 using a missile supplied by @entity140			2

' some of these vehicles returned to the 53rd @entity158 base in @entity178 and joined the july 19th convoy from the base , while at least one other , a @entity8 missile loader , appears to have left the main convoy and towards the @entity23 border , close to a separatist - held crossing			1
' as yet , it has not been possible to establish when the june 23rd convoy returned to the 53rd @entity187 base in @entity178 , or how many units were in the convoy			0
' however , it is clear that at least one @entity8 missile launcher ( 3x2 ) from the june 23rd convoy was inside separatist - controlled territory on july 17th , and 3 days later a video was uploaded showing that the @entity196 loader unit was very close to the @entity23 border			1
' considering the established time frames , logical routes , and photographic evidence , it is possible that this @entity8 missile launcher was part of the same june 23rd convoy as “ @entity202 ” and supported it			2
' in the opinion of the @entity2 investigation team , the @entity8 missile launcher filmed and photographed travelling through separatist - held territory on july 17th is the same vehicle seen in the convoy travelling through @entity5 towards to the @entity23 border in late june 2014			1

a @entity218 report into @entity138 found , in september , that a ' large number of high - energy objects ' penetrated its fuselage			0
prosecutors are still working establish exactly where the missile was fired from with a view to taking action against the perpetrators .			0

the @entity13 has charted the lead - up and aftermath to the shooting down of @entity111 @entity2
it concludes that the @entity5 military did supply separatists with a @entity8 missile launcher prior to the july 17 atrocity
@entity39 uses a *collection* of material from social media , publications and broadcasters and satellite images to draw its conclusions
has ' undeniable evidence ' separatists in @entity23 were in control of a missile launcher three hours before the downing of @entity2 and was later filmed minus one missile driving through separatist - controlled @entity47
