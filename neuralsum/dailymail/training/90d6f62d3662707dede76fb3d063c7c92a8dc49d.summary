mr @entity10 , from @entity29 , was working in a trench at the time the wall fell , and it toppled onto him , leaving him trapped			1
workers tried to dig him out as his father helplessly cradled his head while he lay unconscious			0
however , despite the emergency services arriving within minutes , mr @entity10 tragically died at the scene			0
during the trial , the jury heard that had the trench walls been properly supported , the wall would not have collapsed and mr @entity10 would not have died			2
he had been employed by @entity42 to work on the basement renovation and the company was contracted to provide building services at the residential property , including the excavation of the basement and the underpinning of the supporting walls			0
the court heard how company boss @entity7 visited the site two or three times a week but failed to improve the dangerous conditions for the workers			1

in a statement read outside court yesterday , mr @entity10 's sister @entity75 and fiancée @entity75 described his death as a ' tragic loss '			0
' he was the most gentle , kind - hearted and generous man you could ever hope to meet , ' they said			2
' he worked for @entity7 for more than two years before he was killed , but we were shocked to hear evidence at the trial about how dangerous the site had become , and how little concern @entity7 showed for the safety of everyone involved in the excavation works			1
' we hope the verdict makes other construction company directors take stock of their own working practices , and ensure that they are doing everything possible to keep their workers safe			2
' the owners of the two - storey @entity101 semi-detached home decided to renovate their property , at a cost of £ 576,000 , in 2010			1
the first and second floors were to be refurbished , a new conservatory and kitchen added on the ground floor and a basement created			0
workers were using the traditional method of underpinning to create the basement , by digging under sections of existing walls and deepening the foundations to make the new walls			0
@entity7 , 46 , commercial director of construction company @entity8 , was found guilty at @entity9 of manslaughter after failing to inspect and address the dangerous site conditions for workers trenches were excavated adjacent to exterior walls to allow workers to dig horizontally through the earth , underneath the walls of the house and replace with reinforced concrete			1
however , even though the work was dangerous and the design was changed , the underpinning of the £ 168,000 basement was not properly planned			1
workers were left to their own devices to figure out how and when they would prop up trenches to stop them collapsing			0
@entity8 employee @entity132 told the trial he was never shown a method statement , plan or design and said workers were left to prop up trenches based on whether they felt safe			0
he said earth often collapsed on them when they were digging and large sections of the trench he was working in were not supported at all			2
workers regularly discussed the dangerous conditions , jurors heard			1
mr @entity10 's father said the gravelly earth was like digging with sand , with trenches often crumbling in on themselves			0
mr @entity10 , a manual labourer from @entity29 , died after being trapped by a falling wall as he worked in a trench during the renovations the court also heard how just weeks before his death , mr @entity10 suffered an electric shock after his shovel hit a live electricity cable that had not been cut off			1
jurors also heard how , in what appeared to be a money - saving decision , excavated earth was used instead of sand to mix concrete			2
the post-mortem examination confirmed mr @entity10 died of severe crush injuries to his chest and abdomen , several bilateral rib fractures and severe underlying injuries to the lungs			0
his heart , aorta and spleen were also damaged , consistent with crushing by masonry			0
@entity62 , who had the authority to stop dangerous works , inspected the site on october 26 and november 23 , 2010 , but never commented on the excavations			1
the safety document he drafted was also inadequate and not followed			0
in a police interview , he said he was shocked and insisted he had not seen the trenches which were hidden under boards			0
@entity7 said he briefed workers and employee @entity186 who he believed was supervising the build			2
he told police that to the best of his knowledge nothing was wrong with the site and he took no steps to improve the site despite being aware of the dangerous conditions			1
following the incident , a local authority building control officer found the house was potentially at danger of collapse			0
a dangerous structure notice was served and the property had to be stabilised by independent contractors			2
after the verdict , detective chief inspector @entity203 , of the @entity205 's homicide and major crime command , who worked closely the @entity63 , said : ' there was overwhelming evidence that @entity7 and @entity62 's failure to carry out their respective roles directly resulted in the death of @entity10			2
' in this case the danger of collapse was not only foreseeable , it had been specifically identified by @entity62 in his risk assessments			0
' sadly , for @entity10 's family this lapse would have tragic consequences and give rise to his untimely death			0
