by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 21 march 2013 updated : 07:33 est , 21 march 2013 a little boy born without shinbones , knees or ankles is finally able to own his first pair of shoes after being fitted with special prosthetic legs with feet			1
three - year - old @entity10 's new legs have feet - unlike his last few pairs			1
this week , he tried out his new blue fibreglass prosthetic legs for the first time on the basketball court at the @entity16 , in @entity17 , @entity18			1
up and about : three - year - old @entity10 tries out his new prosthetic legs with feet he was born with without shinbones , knees or ankles due to a rare condition called tibial hemimelia scans while his mother @entity25 was pregnant failed to reveal that @entity10 was suffering from the rare condition tibial hemimelia			1
this is where there the tibia - the shinbone - is either partially or totally missing at birth			2
the foot may also be deformed or may have additional toes			0
@entity10 's condition meant his parents , @entity25 and @entity37 , were forced to take the agonising decision to have his legs amputated when he was a year old			1
the youngster has previously been fitted with two other types of prosthetics , but this is the first set with actual feet			2
and as soon as the new blue fibreglass legs were strapped on with @entity46 , he was on the move			2
his mother said : ' he 's incredible - nothing stops him			2
rare : the condition means the tibia - the shinbone - is either partially or totally missing at birth now he has feet , @entity10 will be able to choose his first pair of shoes ' we thought he might need a frame to get around at first , so i ca n't believe how well he 's doing			1
we 're going shoe shopping tomorrow for the first time			0
' @entity62 @entity61 , who made and adjusted each of @entity10 's three sets of legs , said it usually took children up to three or four years to move through the progressions of leg extensions			2
' he 's getting these much earlier than we 'd normally do it , just because he 's so confident and @entity71 'll fly through these			0
' most legs affected by tibial hemimelia will look ' unusual '			1
it can occur either in one leg or both legs , with 30 per cent of patients having both legs affected			0
it is detected at birth , if not before			0
on the move : as soon as the new blue fibreglass legs were strapped on with @entity46 , @entity10 was walking about tibial @entity84 can occur either in one leg or both legs , with 30 per cent of patients having both legs affected treatment depends on the exact form of the condition			1
for the mildest form , apparatus may be used to lengthen the leg and improve the position of the foot			0
in more severe cases , amputation is often considered the best option , followed by the use of a prosthetic leg			0
some attempts at reconstruction using the fibula have been made , but rarely provide a well functioning limb due to instability at the knee and problems with the quadriceps ( thigh ) musculature			0
