by @entity1 reporter published : 11:34 est , 9 april 2012 updated : 15:31 est , 9 april 2012 a @entity4 @entity3 pilot has told how he attacked people at random after taking prescribed amphetamines , as new figures reveal that the number of active - duty troops taking sedatives and antidepressants has increased eightfold since 2005			1
last year , @entity13 was flying a @entity15 bomber from the @entity16 back home to @entity18 , while taking a tablet of @entity20 every four hours during the 19 - hour journey			1
after landing the aircraft , the father - of - one attacked a fellow crewman at random , striking him in the head and yelling incomprehensible phrases about being kidnapped , according to the @entity27			1
@entity28 : @entity13 , center , pictured with his wife @entity30 , left , and son @entity31 , right , was found not guilty of various charges after military psychologists found he suffered from ' polysubstance - induced delirium ' he then directed his anger at their female driver , wrestling her to the ground , and telling her : â€˜ me and my platoon are looking for terrorists			1
' he grabbed her keys , drove away and crashed the car into a guardrail			2
@entity13 was charged with auto theft , drunk driving and two counts of assault			2
but - in an unprecedented ruling - he was found not guilty ' by reason of lack of mental responsibility ' after four military psychologists concluded the young lieutenant suffered from ' polysubstance - induced delirium ' , caused by alcohol , lack of sleep and the 40 milligrams of @entity20			1
' three drinks over an entire evening is not enough to black somebody out , but i do n't remember 99 per cent of what happened over the rest of that evening , ' @entity13 told the newspaper			0
' it was kind of like i was misfiring on the cylinders			0
' questions : staff sgt. @entity69 is accused of murdering 17 @entity71 civilians but his lawyers would like to find out if her was taking any medication the rare ruling comes as new figures obtained by the @entity27 reveal that more than 110,000 active - duty @entity78 troops last year were taking prescribed antidepressants , narcotics , sedatives , antipsychotics and anti-anxiety drugs			1
@entity84 , a @entity85 corporal based at @entity86 , began showing symptoms of @entity88 after his first tour in @entity90			0
despite military doctors recommending that he receive in - patient treatment , he was sent on his second tour			1
there he displayed more pronounced symptoms of ptsd including , nightmares and hallucinations , and was prescribed 12 different types of medication			0
two months before the 21 - year - old was due to return home , he was found dead on the floor of his room in the barracks			1
an autopsy concluded that the death was accidental due to multiple - drug toxicity , or interactions among too many drugs			2
@entity112 was just 20 years old when he shot a @entity114 commander in the face during a schizophrenic episode			0
just weeks before the incident , he had been flown to a @entity118 where he was prescribed two psychotropic drugs , @entity120 and @entity121 , and returned to his base			0
his condition worsened , with the voices inside his head , and his hallucinations , intensifying			0
@entity112 's prison sentence was later reduced from 12 - and - a - half to ten years after it was shown that he suffered from schizophrenia and @entity88			2
psychiatric experts concluded that he was ' unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness of his conduct at the time of the alleged criminal misconduct			0
' moreover , nearly 8 per cent of the @entity78 is now on sedatives and more than 6 per cent is on antidepressants , reflecting an eightfold increase since 2005			1
@entity139 , a former military psychologist , told the newspaper : ' we have never medicated our troops to the extent we are doing now ...			2
and i do n't believe the current increase in suicides and homicides in the military is a coincidence			0
' this had led many military lawyers and psychiatrists to link their clients ' aberrant behavior to the prescription medications they are taking			1
in the most recent case , the attorneys of staff sgt. @entity69 , who was accused of murdering 17 @entity71 civilians , have asked for a list of all the medicines the 38 - year - old was taking			1
but @entity4 military officials claim that the use of drugs in the army is comparable to that by the civilians , arguing that prescribing medications is a calculated - but , at times , necessary - risk			1
' it 's not that we 're using them more frequently or any differently , ' col. @entity171 , a pharmacy consultant for the army surgeon general , told the newspaper			0
' as with any medication , you have to look at weighing the risk versus the benefits of somebody going on a medication			0
' @entity183 , director of the @entity184 , believes medication is necessary in many cases			0
' i will tell you that we currently run a treatment program at @entity190 where we 're treating suicide attempters , and medicines are critical sometimes early in the process of treatment			0
' now , i will tell you that we do n't want people to be on medications for indefinite periods of time , but i certainly have seen medicine save lives , ' he told @entity203 .			2
