by @entity0 published : 18:38 est , 7 october 2012 updated : 01:53 est , 8 october 2012 more than half of households make no contribution to the state as a result of @entity8 ’s decision to increase spending on benefits , a report reveals today			1
in a 53.4 per cent of homes , state handouts and services now outweigh their tax payments			2
in 2001 - prior to @entity8 ’s debt binge - the figure was less than 44 per cent			1
@entity18 : more than half of households make no contribution to the state as a result of @entity8 's decision to increase spending on benefits , a report reveals today it had increased by only 0.7 per cent since 1979			1
it then exploded after @entity8 used tax credits and other handouts to drag a huge number of new households into the pay of the @entity33			2
the @entity34 , which compiled the report , said the situation was ‘ unsustainable ’			1
the think - tank says benefits will have to be slashed , and the pension age increased , to balance the books			2
@entity41 , head of economics at the @entity34 , said : ‘ these data show that even before the financial crisis , the @entity8 government was ramping up spending on cash benefits and benefits in kind without corresponding increases in taxation			1
increase : the proportion of non-retired households receiving a cash benefit other than child benefit rose from 40.3 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2010/11 ¿ an increase of over a million households ‘ this was not redistribution from rich to poor , but redistribution from the future to the present			2
it felt good at the time , but given the government does n’t have its own money , was unsustainable			0
’ the study , based on figures from the @entity69 , shows the government is becoming ever more reliant on the taxes paid by higher earners			0
only the wealthiest 20 per cent of society are paying significantly more to the state - £ 20,125 - a - year - than they receive in benefits and public services			2
state services and benefits include unemployment and child benefits and health and education			0
taxes include vat , @entity85 and alcohol duty , as well as payments to @entity88			0
criticism : last week , @entity8 leader @entity90 criticised the @entity91 for cutting the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 per cent for the highest earners between 2001 and last year , around three million more households became net recipients of the state			1
over this period , middle - income households have moved from being significant net contributors to the state to significant net recipients - taking out £ 4,589 more than they put in			0
in 1990 , middle income households faced an effective tax rate of 8.2 per cent			0
but by 2010/11 this had reversed , the study says			0
the effective tax rate was minus 20 per cent			0
the households with the lowest incomes received £ 10,153 more in benefits than paid in taxes			0
the report acknowledges that at least part of the change in effective tax rates is down to changing demographics , with an increasing proportion of retired households			0
but even in non-retired households 39.6 per cent received more in benefits than they paid in taxes - up from 31.7 per cent in 1979 and 29.0 per cent in 2001			1
the proportion of non-retired households receiving a cash benefit other than child benefit rose from 40.3 per cent in 2001 to 44.6 per cent in 2010/11 – an increase of over a million households			2
@entity130 , director of the @entity34 , said : ‘ these trends are unsustainable – particularly given the ageing profile of the @entity134 population			1
‘ reversing the trend will require implementation of tough policies to get more people into work , to continue the reform of public services , to restrain increases in the cost of benefits payment , and to ensure that enterprise has the freedom to flourish - leading to more growth , more employment and higher wages and salaries			0
’ it comes at a time when the @entity153 and @entity8 are insisting the wealthy must do more to help the nation ’s finances recover			1
last week , @entity8 leader @entity90 criticised the @entity91 for cutting the top rate of tax from 50 to 45 per cent for the highest earners .			1

in 2001 - prior to @entity8 ’s debt binge - the figure was less than 44 per cent
