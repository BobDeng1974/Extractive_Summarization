among the stream of letdowns to flow from @entity3 ’s @entity2 perhaps the most poignant poured from the lips of @entity5 on sunday			1
@entity5 is the most inventive @entity3 batsman of his generation , and that includes @entity9			1
he is resolutely his own man – a dubliner who crossed the @entity12 , an advocate of the @entity14 in a country which often disdains it , and a thoughtful presence around the traps , alert with a hint of aloof			0
but the system can drag down the best			2
and so , reflecting on the horrific nine - wicket loss to @entity22 in @entity23 after @entity3 had scored 309 for 6 , @entity5 sought comfort in stats			1
@entity3 captain @entity5 found solace in statistics following the heavy defeat by @entity22 first this : ‘ we were 25 above par , and the stats backed that up			1
@entity34 here is about 275 - 280			2
’ then this : ‘ we bowled a lot of bad balls			0
over the next couple of days we ’ll get the @entity36 stuff , and the proof will be in that			0
’ stats have always been a hallmark of @entity45 ’s @entity3			1
famously , he introduced @entity47 to @entity48 , @entity50 ’s classic account of sabermetrics ( the statistical analysis of baseball ) ; infamously , he allowed stats to encourage the selection of @entity56 against @entity57 in 2008			1
stats work – and they do n’t			2
at their best , they confirm hunches			0
at their worst , they become a usefully faceless scapegoat : do n’t blame us , we were only following the stats ! we exaggerate , but not by much			2
what , after all , is the relevance of stats when the change in fielding restrictions has made 300 the norm ? and why defer to @entity36 when @entity72 told you @entity3 bowled like drains ? @entity75 needs to be cut loose at the top of the batting order when the situation merits his promotion @entity80 ( left ) is suffering from poor form and @entity3 's insistence on using him as a @entity83 the system is n’t working			1
if it were working – or even close to working – @entity3 would not have lost to @entity86 by 111 runs , to @entity88 with more than 37 overs to spare , and to @entity22 by nine wickets while defending over 300			1
the associate nations are making a better fist of things			0
so if not the system , then what ? @entity98 , by nature a free spirit , has inherited a job weighed down by @entity101 caution			2
roundheads are better at @entity103 ; cavaliers prefer one - dayers			2
and @entity3 are playing a form of 50 - over cricket more suited to @entity108 and 1645			1
conservatism continues to bedevil them			0
when @entity75 hit the fastest one - day hundred by an @entity3 batsman , against @entity22 at @entity114 , @entity111 told us he was n’t ready for @entity103			1
@entity116 has not been trusted in the one - day side , despite producing the innings of the @entity119 last march			2
@entity120 has been shunted to no 6 , after prospering at @entity83			0
the free - hitting @entity116 has not been trusted to form a regular part of their 50 - over batting order @entity120 leaps to take a catch against @entity22 - and his position in the order has also dived to no 6 @entity3 have inverted one of the first rules of international sport , which is to do what the opposition least wants you to do			1
after @entity133 and @entity134 put on 172 in 30 overs against @entity136 , in came @entity80 , a talented batsman whose confidence is being undermined by being asked to slot straight into a demanding role on the biggest stage of all			0
why not @entity75 , armed with a licence to do something violent ? instead , @entity80 scratched around for 10 in 18 balls , @entity3 slowed down , and a near - certain score of 350 - plus became 303 for 8			1
beggars with terrible net run - rates can not be choosers			2
the total proved well beyond @entity136 – but , funnily enough , not beyond @entity22 , whose 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ( @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 , @entity152 ) is as classy as anything in the tournament			1
yet , after @entity133 and @entity134 had again provided a useful platform ( 62 in nine overs ) , @entity3 proceeded to potter around before the final assault , safe in the knowledge that the 300 was ‘ 25 above par ’			1
for more musings on matters cricketing , please follow us on @entity164 : @ the_topspin the lunacy is that , for perhaps the first time ever , this @entity3 team contains batsmen capable of casting off the straitjacket : @entity133 , @entity120 , @entity5 and @entity75			1
and if @entity169 had played the lofted reverse - sweep for six produced by @entity171 during a @entity172 over costing 25 , we ’d never have heard the end of it			2
there is talent in that dressing - room			2
there will be more to come : look at @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181			0
but it is weighed down by the notion that one - day teams can rationalise their way to victory			2
here , @entity3 seemed to have borrowed not so much from @entity48 as from @entity187			1
in one scene from @entity191 ’s film a movie producer is overheard at a party : ‘ right now it ’s only a notion , but i think i can get the money to make it into a concept and later turn it into an idea			0
’ @entity3 coach @entity45 has been left to reflect on an embarrassing start to the @entity2 @entity45 is a fan of @entity48 ( left ) but his regime has more in common with @entity187 @entity3 seem to believe that stats will ease them all the way through from notion to concept to idea to … @entity2 success ! this may work in test cricket			1
it sure as hell does n’t work in the 50 - over game			2
it may be too late to salvage anything from the wreckage of this tournament			0
but if @entity3 accept that stats - driven prudence is no way to win one - day internationals , they can yet challenge for the @entity223			1
@entity224 new - ball nightmare @entity3 ’s over-planned batting is only part of their problem			1
after the weekend matches , they had claimed only 22 wickets in four games , a lower ratio than anyone except @entity234 and the @entity235			0
and they had leaked 6.33 an over , more than anyone except @entity238			0
the point has been made that @entity3 ’s battery of right - arm seamers have become distinguishable only by height and hair colour			1
but it would n’t matter if their two biggest guns – @entity248 and @entity249 , with over 1,000 international wickets between them – were at their best			0
instead , they are suffering almost identical nightmares : both have two wickets and have gone at 6.27 an over , with @entity248 averaging 91 to @entity249 ’s 92			0
during @entity3 ’s tour of @entity22 , it was regularly assumed the attack would be stronger for their return from injury			1
we ’ll keep holding our breath			0
the bowling of @entity249 ( left ) and @entity248 ( right ) has been smashed at the @entity2 so far shifting the goalposts there ’s nothing like a ( nother ) @entity2 fiasco to skew the debate			1
but : @entity9 or not @entity9 ? – that is the question			0
once this @entity2 is over , it ’s all about test cricket : 17 matches in 10 months , including yet another @entity271			2
yet the @entity103 line - up looks settled , apart from an opening slot , where @entity9 would n’t bat anyway			0
which of @entity275 , @entity171 , @entity134 or @entity133 are you going to drop ? and if @entity9 is to be brought back for the one - day team , you ’d have to ask a fresh batch of questions about how seriously @entity3 are about winning the @entity223 : @entity9 will turn 39 that june			1
no - one can doubt his brilliance at the height of his one - day international career			0
but he drifted away from the 50 - over format in his final year as an @entity3 player , and did n’t do especially well when he was picked			1
yes , he ’d put bums on seats and get people talking about cricket			0
but let ’s not pretend he ’d be the saviour of the @entity101 game			0
@entity9 ( right ) has had the door opened on a potential return to the @entity3 set - up someone else ’s problem @entity295 earned a few pats on the back for saying , after @entity298 had thrashed the @entity235 , that the associate nations needed more exposure at the highest level			1
but the devil was in the detail : that exposure , @entity295 intimated , could not come against @entity298 , who already have their hands full			0
and there ’s the rub			0
the big boys profess their support in theory , but with one crucial caveat : not on my patch			0
cricket ’s closed shop remains open all hours			0
@entity295 insists the associate nations should get more game time ... so long as it 's not against @entity298			0

@entity3 are suffering a miserable @entity2
@entity5 sought refuge in statistics after latest defeat against @entity22
stats are hallmark of regime of @entity45 , a fan of @entity48
but system of stats - driven prudence is failing *miserably*
