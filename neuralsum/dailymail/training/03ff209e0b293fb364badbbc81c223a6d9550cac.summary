music from @entity2 films was played at @entity3 on monday night but , by the end of a dispiriting draw with @entity6 , the soundtrack to @entity8 would have been more appropriate			1
one win in 13 games , out of both cup competitions at the first hurdle for the first time in their distinguished history and with problems mounting , @entity9 @entity18 and it is not showing any signs of being turned down			1
@entity21 ' controversial failure from the penalty spot was the headline - grabbing moment of the stalemate against @entity6 and , perhaps , it was a symbol of where @entity26 currently stand			1
@entity28 looks at some of the issues			0
spot of bother this is not the first time there has been dissent over an @entity26 player taking a penalty at @entity3			1
in may 1994 , when the club 's top - flight status was in grave danger , @entity39 marched from his goal with the intention of taking responsibility against @entity46			2
@entity47 , however , was adamant he would take it and did , beating @entity49			0
the significance of the @entity6 penalty could not be equated – @entity52 , for one , does n't think @entity21 did anything wrong – but it is still a serious issue			1
@entity26 attacking midfielder @entity47 takes a penalty against @entity46 and scores at @entity3 @entity47 was adamant he would take the penalty for @entity26 and did , beating goalkeeper @entity49 @entity39 marched from his goal with the intention of taking the penalty against @entity46 last season @entity26 's players were a tight unit			1
they maintain that is still the case but you now see bickering and individuals putting themselves first , which is what @entity21 did			1
if he was thinking of the team , he would have listened to @entity70 and @entity71 telling him to ' give it to @entity73 '			0
conspiracy theorists will think @entity21 acted with the aim of getting himself a move – he is on the radar of @entity78 , @entity79 and @entity80 – but that is risible			1
he does not have a @entity83 character and no self - respecting professional would do that			2
you can not help but wonder , though , whether @entity21 is unsettled and a parting of the ways may be inevitable in the summer			1
he has 18 months left on his contract but , having been on @entity91 for three years , would it really surprise if this @entity92 moved elsewhere ? @entity21 and @entity95 debate over who should take the penalty at @entity3 on monday night @entity95 appeared to back away and let @entity21 take the kick as he patted the @entity92 forward on the head @entity21 was substituted at half - time by @entity26 manager @entity18 after missing the penalty where is the @entity103 ? back in april , when @entity105 had been flattened by one of the best @entity26 performances of the modern era , @entity18 's stock could not have higher			1
@entity26 fans adored him and his name was being touted with a number of different positions			1
the situation is very different today			0
it would be wrong to suggest @entity18 is fighting to save his job but the pressure is growing on him to arrest this worrying slide			1
he has to find answers and placate a section of the fan base who harbour deep concerns			0
there was a ' moment ' against @entity6 that underlined all is not well			1
when he substituted @entity26 's best performer @entity125 , in the second half , there was uproar and booing			2
@entity18 claimed @entity125 was injured but he did n't look to be struggling when sprinting off			2
@entity18 had the @entity129 in his first season for making substitutions that changed games but this year it has been lost and some of his critics will need to be convinced he is not a one - season wonder			1
the @entity26 team he is managing now looks slow and laboured , not fast and vibrant			2
@entity18 's men looked a different side to the one that beat @entity105 last season in april it would be wrong to suggest @entity18 is fighting to save his job but the pressure is growing on the manager not banking on @entity146 @entity18 's enthusiasm for @entity146 has been boundless since he arrived at @entity3			1
he has compared him to @entity150 legend @entity149 and claimed that not even a @entity152 - sized fee would convince @entity26 to sell			1
that enthusiasm , however , has created expectation			0
@entity146 was thrilling last year but this season he has looked lost , never playing in the central position that suits him so well ; he is going through the kind of dip all young players experience but , from some fans , there is no forgiveness			0
he was pilloried at times for losing possession and as the game was meandering to its conclusion , the howls of frustration that @entity146 was not going to win it became louder			0
he looks like a player that would benefit from some time on the sidelines			0
@entity18 , though , is not concerned			2
' @entity146 has got the top personality , ' said @entity18			2
' you get a player who loses the ball a couple of times and they hide			0
that 's when you 've got a real issue			0
with @entity146 , last season he was just a young man enjoying his football , now he 's @entity146 and the opposition pay him extra attention			0
' @entity146 was thrilling last season for @entity26 but has struggled to live up to the hype this year @entity146 has found himself going through a dip in form for @entity26 this season at @entity3 a growing sense of @entity191 @entity18 should not be in charge of a group of players that are peering anxiously over their shoulders but they are running the risk of being sucked into the skirmishes at the bottom			1
they have their lowest points total after 22 games since 2000 - 01 and the fixture list is threatening			2
after they return from a warm - weather training break , they face @entity212 ( away ) , @entity208 ( home ) , @entity210 ( away ) , @entity203 ( home ) and @entity105 ( away ) , plus a @entity206 assignment against @entity207			0
they need the hamstrung @entity213 back for that sequence			0
' the break will do us good , ' said @entity219 defender @entity217			0
' we will regroup and see where we are after that			0
we are not looking at the table			0
we are just focusing on how we can improve			0
' how quickly @entity18 finds the answers will determine how long the heat stays on him			2
@entity18 has an anxious - looking squad but @entity217 ( left ) feels their warm - weather break will do good			1

@entity26 drew 0 - 0 with @entity6 at @entity3 on monday night
@entity21 missed a penalty he should have left to @entity95
@entity18 is under *increasing* pressure after the latest stalemate
@entity233 : @entity21 ' *refusal* to let @entity95 take penalty was *despicable*
