by @entity0 @entity0 returns for his latest @entity1 , all about the @entity2			1
@entity0 was not selected by @entity3 for a place in @entity5 this summer but was involved in the @entity7 squad during the qualifying campaign			1
he also knows several of the @entity7 team very well through playing alongside them at @entity11 and has some words of advice for @entity3 ahead of the opening match against @entity15 on saturday : play a team almost entirely made up of players who live or were born in @entity18 ! the waiting and the anticipation for all football fans will finally be over this evening when the @entity2 finally gets underway			1
ever since the host nation for the 2014 tournament was first announced ( without any controversy or bung allegations by the way ! ) the clamour for fans and players alike to go to watch or play in the home of the undisputed kings of international football has been incredible			0
having played some part of the battle to be in @entity5 myself i can tell you that every top player desperately wanted to be there to represent his country on the biggest stage			1
@entity41 : @entity42 is in contention to play as an attacking midfielder for @entity7 against @entity15 each and every one of them will now be really looking forward to the tournament starting but they 'll doubtless also spare a thought for those who , through no fault of their own , wo n't be involved			1
there seems to have been more unlucky players ( who could well have made a big impact ) this time than ever before			0
@entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 all miss out injured , as do our own @entity61 and @entity63			0
then there are worries about @entity66 and @entity67 too			0
i was also disappointed that my former temporary team - mate @entity69 was ruled out of the @entity71 squad with a bad injury			1
i do n't think i 've ever played alongside a lad who smiled more than @entity74 and it 's a real shame for a lovely guy			0
they will all be missed but there is still enough quality and class to excite us			0
@entity11 connection : @entity0 's @entity11 team - mates @entity84 ( left ) and @entity85 ( right ) in @entity5 my interest in @entity7 will , of course , be enhanced by the presence of three of my team - mates in the squad			1
@entity85 , @entity84 and @entity42 all thoroughly deserve to be there and i hope @entity93 and @entity94 do well for their respective countries as well			1
and i do n't want to forget all my former team - mates who are out there either so a big shout to @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 , @entity107 ( who has done fantastically well to push his career on since leaving @entity11 ) and @entity109			1
i 'm actually hoping that we get big @entity109 back next season but i 'm out of the loop on that one ! it 's great for @entity114 to have so many players to look out for but my own loyalty will obviously be with @entity7			1
when i was part of the squad and playing a couple of games i did think i may have had a chance of going to @entity5 but it was clear a long way out that i was n't going to make it so i contented myself with being happy for @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity42 ... and also @entity126 who make the stand - by list			1
@entity128 has been immense for us and for such a young player in such a challenging position on the pitch to even be considered for the @entity2 shows how well he 's done			0
wish you wee there ? @entity0 with @entity2 - bound team - mates @entity84 ( left ) and @entity94 ( right ) @entity124 and @entity125 are certain to start the games and i am sure that @entity3 , who i have a great deal of time for and will always be grateful to for making me an @entity7 player , will utilise @entity42 's unique talent			1
our three lads will be just as influential off the pitch as they are on it , by the way			0
they are three lively individuals who are great tourists and will more than play their part in keeping boredom at bay in @entity5 ... especially @entity125 with his guitar ! it all just shows how well @entity11 have done over the last few seasons			1
we could easily have three players starting a @entity2 game for @entity7 and that 's a terrific achievement that has n't happened since the days of @entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 and @entity158 back in 1986			2
in fact , you can stretch that to cover the whole city			0
@entity18 is very well represented in @entity3 's squad and it 's not beyond the realms of possibility that the city has eight players starting a game			2
in my opinion there are six - nailed on starters in @entity173 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176 and if you add @entity42 and @entity179 to that list it makes for an incredible statistic			1
and if we add @entity100 to that , as he 's a scouser too , we can call it nine ! with regards to how @entity7 will do , i think the first game on saturday against @entity15 is absolutely vital			2
lose that one and there 's a massive hill to climb to even get out of the group			0
losing the first game can often prompt a media frenzy back home and the pressure can be cranked up even more than it is anyway			0
a defeat against @entity15 would also knock the confidence a bit			0
but let 's be positive and believe that @entity7 can beat the @entity199 and the feelgood factor could carry us onwards and upwards			2
i genuinely think that 's what will happen			0
@entity15 , for me , are not the force they have been in the past and if we get amongst them then we 'll have too much for them			0
now , what team would you pick ? if for some inexplicable reason you woke up on saturday morning with a voice message on your mobile from @entity3 asking you to select the @entity7 team what would you do ? give him the nod : @entity100 should play up front - and he still counts as a @entity217 , says @entity0 one thing i can guarantee , and it 's something that makes football special , is that everybody will have something slightly different from the guy or girl sitting next to you			1
it could be a different player in the team , a player in a different position , a different formation ... anything			2
and discussing it and arguing with family and friends in front of the television or in the pub is what makes the @entity2 so addictive			0
i know that my dad and my brother would select a different team to me ... and i also know that my mum will do better with her bets than the three of us put together ! however , when @entity3 rings me from @entity5 , here 's what i 'll tell him			1
big loss : the @entity2 will be poorer for the loss of the likes of @entity56 through injury ' @entity3 , thanks for the call , hope all is well over there			2
you need @entity256 in goal behind a flat back - four of @entity173 , @entity101 , @entity85 and @entity84			1
then you want a midfield three of @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity258 with @entity42 in the hole behind a top two of @entity176 and @entity100			1
that should be enough to beat @entity15 , so good luck and i 'll ring you on sunday with our line - up for @entity266			2
' i actually think @entity267 would have had the role behind the strikers if he was fully fit but i would certainly trust @entity42 or @entity179 to do the job			2
my team gets both the strikers operating just where they want to play			2
it gets us a man in the ' no 10 ' position who would be extremely difficult to mark when you have two strikers and it allows both of our full backs to get forward , which is what they both want to do			0
it leaves @entity175 to drop deep and we 'd still have two men in midfield			2
i believe this xi could do the job out there but it 's not about what i think and i have absolute confidence that @entity3 will pick the right team			1
the beautiful home of the beautiful game : every footballer wanted to play in @entity5 this summer regardless , we are clearly in a very tough group			2
@entity15 is always a difficult and tight game for us and @entity266 and @entity300 are both very good teams who are far more used to the conditions in @entity303			0
@entity266 in particular have some outstanding individuals but whether i 'm thinking with my head or my heart , i can see a way through for us			0
indeed , i would n't be overly surprised if we win all three of our group games			0
i will certainly be cheering us on as enthusiastically as anyone and if we do reach the knockout stage anything can happen			0
i just hope we have a bit more luck than we normally do and if any of the later games go to penalties , here 's my advice to @entity3 ... do n't call me ! @entity0 supports @entity318 and @entity319			1
