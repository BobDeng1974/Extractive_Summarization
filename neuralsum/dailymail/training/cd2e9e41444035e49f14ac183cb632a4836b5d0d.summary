@entity0 has been described as ' lucky ' by @entity2 pundits @entity3 and @entity4 , after the @entity6 star was seen appearing to swing an arm towards the face of @entity10 defender @entity9			1
the incident occurred towards the end of the @entity13 4 - 1 @entity15 triumph against their @entity17 opponents on monday night at @entity18			1
after shielding the ball out for a goal kick from @entity0 , @entity9 was bumped into the @entity21 by the 20 - year - old - much to the annoyance of the @entity23			1
@entity6 's @entity0 ( right ) swung an arm towards the face of @entity9 ( left ) on monday the incident came during the closing stages of @entity6 's 4 - 1 @entity15 win against @entity10 the pair , who had been battling against each other throughout the game , confronted one another before @entity0 was seen to aim a swing at @entity9 right in front of the linesman			1
@entity0 's indescrestion went unpunished by referee @entity36 and the makeshift forward was subseqeuntly replaced by boss @entity38 - with @entity39 his replacement on 82 minutes			1
the incident was the second @entity42 in two days where a player has been caught on camera swinging a flailing arm towards an opponent			0
it started after @entity0 ( right ) barged @entity9 into the @entity21 stand during a tussle for the ball @entity0 's ( right ) nudge irked @entity9 ( left ) who put his hand around the back of his neck the pair had to be separated by the linesman ( centre ) as they continue to exchange words @entity0 ( right ) was subsequently replaced by @entity6 for @entity39 after the incident on sunday , @entity64 's @entity63 elbowed @entity66 defender @entity65 in the jaw but has since been charged retrospectively by the @entity68			1
speaking post-match on @entity2 ' @entity70 show @entity3 said : ' he 's [ @entity0 ] a lucky boy			2
@entity63 's been charged retrospectively today			0
' i think the referee and the linesman have both seen this and @entity75 said a few weeks ago that this is a sending off			0
@entity63 will get a three - game ban for violent conduct but how are the referee and linesman going to give credibility where both can say they have n't seen these two incidents			0
' it can not happen where they say they have n't seen it so i think @entity0 will get away with it because the referee ca n't put it in his report that he has n't seen it			0
how he , the linesman , tomorrow , can write in his report that he did n't see it will mean that i think he will lose credibility , i really do			0
' @entity64 's @entity63 ( circled ) was lucky to stay on the pitch after elbowing @entity65 on sunday the mideamonour was the only blemish to an impressive performance by @entity0 playing as the @entity13 ' furthest forward			1
@entity4 added : ' i think he [ @entity0 ] was lucky			0
@entity9 was tight and aggressive and earlier on in the night @entity0 was frustrated with his tackling			2
' he gives a push then @entity9 gives @entity0 a clip with the left hand before @entity0 throws his hand , it 's not a punch , but we 've seen people sent off for things like this			2
' victory for @entity6 moves them up to eighth in the table on 28 points after 19 games ahead of their clash against @entity115 on @entity116			0
