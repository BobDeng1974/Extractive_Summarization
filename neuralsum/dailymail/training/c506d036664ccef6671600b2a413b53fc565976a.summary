by @entity1 reporter published : 20:47 est , 25 august 2012 updated : 21:04 est , 25 august 2012 after spending millions of dollars trying to find a new type of scanner that would allow travelers to keep their shoes on while going through airport security , the @entity3 government decided to leave things as they are			2
the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said it had rejected all four devices that were under consideration because they failed to detect all the explosive devices and metal weapons that were hidden in footwear during tests			1
the news comes less than a year after homeland security secretary @entity19 had announced that the @entity10 is well on its way to develop and put in place new scanning machines that would allow passengers to remain shod , thus cutting down on long lines and complaints			1
dashed hopes : the @entity10 had rejected all four scanning devices that were being tested because they failed to detect all the weapons hidden in footwear but now the @entity10 says that it is not any closer to solving the security scanner problem , the @entity30 reported			1
the policy requiring passengers to take off their footwear was instituted after @entity36 tried unsuccessfully to detonate an explosive device concealed in his shoes on a flight from @entity40 to @entity41 in 2001			1
over the years , the government has made attempts to improve airport security procedures , allowing elderly travelers and children to keep their shoes on when going through airport screening			2
in another move to streamline the process , the @entity10 put in place the @entity53 program in about 20 domestic airports where travelers willing to submit themselves to a security screening may go through checkpoints without having to remove any clothing or part with their laptops			1
pet peeve : passengers say they hate taking off their shoes more than pat - downs and full - body scans while the introduction of full - body scanners to airports around the @entity3 has been a controversial move , with critics raising a host of concerns ranging from radiation to privacy , no part of airport security has drawn more ire from travelers than removing their footwear			1
according to the @entity79 , a @entity80 - based trade group , passengers say they hate taking off their shoes more than pat - downs and full - body scans			0
shoe bomber : the shoe - removal policy was put in place after @entity36 , pictured , attempted to detonate an explosive device hidden in his footwear on a plane in 2001 @entity10 officials are aware that standing security procedures related to the removal of clothing are widely detested by travelers and in no small part contribute to longer lines at checkpoints			1
in 2007 , the agency tested a @entity98 shoe scanner at @entity99			0
the following year , it tested two devices made by @entity102 at @entity104 ’ @entity103 , but none of them had earned the @entity10 ’s stamp of approval			2
another scanning machine that was under consideration was @entity111 , which is manufactured by an @entity113 firm			0
the device , which is meant to detect metal , has been depplyed in hundreds of airports and cruise ships around the world , including in @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity113			0
@entity121 , the company ’s president , told @entity123 the contraption can detect bombs containing metal , but not plastic explosives			0
the government has a $ 1.4million contract with @entity130 , a subsidiary of the @entity132 defense giant @entity131 , to develop a shoe - scanning machine			0
@entity135 ’s device can detect chemical compounds and metal objects , said @entity138 , the president of @entity135 and a former @entity140 official , who added that the @entity10 will be testing a rotoyp of the machine this year			2
. high - tech machine : the @entity144 , made by an @entity113 firm , can detect explosives that contain metals , but not plastic many security experts believe that the @entity10 should abandon its current approach that hinges on finding weapons in shoes and bags and focus instead on detecting the people who may be planning to carry out an attack			1
in @entity113 , security officials are trained to quickly determine whether a passenger may pose a threat by conducting an interview with him or her			0
but critics believe that in the @entity3 , where some 803 million travelers passed through airports last year alone , such an approach would be futile and may open the door on racial profiling .			0
