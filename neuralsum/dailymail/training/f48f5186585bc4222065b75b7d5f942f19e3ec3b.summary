by @entity0 sucking carbon dioxide out of the air might be used as a last - ditch attempt to stop global warming , @entity2 scientists say			1
the technology is proposed as a ‘ @entity8 ’ if governments fail to cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 per cent before 2050			1
reducing greenhouse gases to manageable levels will cost up to four per cent of global gdp by 2030 , according to a draft version of a report to be published in @entity16 on sunday by the @entity17 ( @entity17 )			1
the ' sucking @entity19 ' technology would involve growing crops that absorb co2 from the atmosphere then burning them in a power station to generate energy			1
a biomass plant is pictured			0
the resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground , resulting in @entity29 removed from the air experts could be able to ' suck ' carbon dioxide out of the air by using an experimental system called @entity35 – bio-energy with @entity37			1
it would involve growing crops that absorb co2 from the atmosphere then burn them in a power station to generate energy			1
the resulting emissions would then be captured at the plant and then stored underground			0
the net effect of that process would result in @entity19 being removed from the air			0
@entity49 would be an ideal place to try the technology , because there are thousands of old coal mines and gas wells which could be used as storage facilities for carbon dioxide			1
that would involve @entity49 and other nations increasing spending ten-fold on wind farms and other green projects over the next 15 years			0
but if carbon emissions ‘ overshoot ’ the targets , more extreme solutions are needed which will send the costs spiralling even higher , the @entity17 says			2
a leaked copy of the report , seen by the @entity70 , suggests governments might have to start looking at ‘ negative emissions ’ technology which effectively suck co2 out of the air and store it underground			1
the leaked draft concludes that ‘ essentially any ’ emissions target can be achieved ‘ regardless of the near ‐ term path ’ of overshoot ‘ by shifting emissions reductions to the future ’			2
but it says doing so ‘ involves more rapid and deeper emissions reductions in the long run ’			0
counting the cost : cutting greenhouse gases to manageable levels will cost up to four per cent of global gdp by 2030 , according to a draft version of a forthcoming @entity17 report			1
that would involve @entity49 and other nations increasing spending ten-fold on wind farms ( pictured ) and other green projects over the next 15 years the technology would work by using an experimental system called @entity96			0

@entity49 would be an ideal place to try the technology , because there are thousands of old coal mines and gas wells which could be used as storage facilities for carbon dioxide			1
the system has been tested at small scale in the @entity119 and @entity120 – but the @entity17 admits it would have to happen on a huge scale to be effective			0
@entity49 would be an ideal place to try the technology , because there are thousands of old coal mines ( pictured ) and gas wells which could be used as storage facilities for carbon dioxide @entity127 , an expert at sustainable energy consultancy @entity128 , estimates an area the size of @entity132 would be needed to produce enough biomass crops for @entity35 to suck 10 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the air – a third of the emissions reduction needed by 2050			1
there are also concerns about how safe the technology is and whether it is even possible to store carbon dioxide underground long - term without it leaking			1
the draft @entity17 chapter on energy systems says : ‘ a combination of bio-energy and carbon capture and storage ( @entity35 ) generally will result in net negative emissions			1
@entity35 is one of the few technologies that are capable to remove past co2 emissions remaining the atmosphere			0
’ but it adds : ‘ the risks associated with a large - scale deployment of carbon capture and storage include concerns about the life - cycle toxicity of some capture solvents , the operational safety and long - term integrity of co2 storage sites , as well as risks associated with @entity19 transport via dedicated pipelines			2
’ the @entity165 is already exploring options for capturing carbon from coal and gas - fired plants and hopes to get 13 gigawatts of fossil fuel power with carbon capture systems online by 2030			2
but it is sceptical about the potential of the ‘ carbon negative ’ technology involved with the @entity35 system			2
@entity49 officials have already asked the @entity17 to alter the section on @entity35			0
in a document obtained by the @entity70 , which criticises the wording of the draft , @entity49 representatives said : ‘ it is essential that the limitations of this technology , and the uncertainty and scale , are clearly set out			2
’ other nations , including @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 , also said the prospects for a ‘ negative emissions ’ technology should be toned down			1
@entity194 of @entity195 said there are many uncertainties associated with storing carbon dioxide			2
he said : ‘ it might work in countries like the @entity49 and @entity201 where there are lots of empty oil wells and gas wells			0
‘ but compared to the problem it can only play a minor role			0
and we do n’t actually know if the @entity19 will even remain in the ground			0
‘ overall it would be much cheaper to just go to straight to a carbon neutral renewable technology			0
’ conclusive ? last september the first part of the @entity17 's report summarised the physical science of climate change , concluding that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ' dominant cause ' of global warming the @entity17 report is the first major assessment in seven years of the technological options and economic costs of dealing with climate change			1
the document is the final part in a trilogy of reports published by the @entity17 on the causes , impacts and solutions to climate change			0
last september the first part of the report summarised the physical science of climate change , concluding that scientists are 95 per cent certain that humans are the ‘ dominant cause ’ of global warming			2
the second part , published a fortnight ago , warned that the drastic impacts of climate change are ‘ already occurring on all continents and across the oceans ’			0
the draft of the third report says that reducing global warming to 2c , beyond which the impacts would start to become irreversible , ‘ will require large - scale changes of the global energy system as well as cuts in greenhouse gas emissions over the coming decades ’			1
it adds : ‘ @entity254 [ to ] 2030 will increase the challenges of , and reduce the options for , bringing atmospheric concentration levels [ to safe levels ] by the end of the century			0

' negative emissions ' technology is proposed as a ‘ @entity8 ’ if governments fail to cut carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 per cent before 2050
cutting greenhouse gases to manageable levels will cost up to 4 *%* of global gdp by 2030 , according to a draft of a forthcoming @entity17 report
the tech involves growing crops that absorb @entity19 then burning them in a power station to make energy , capturing co2 and storing it underground
@entity49 would be the ideal place to try it because there are thousands of *disused* coal mines that could be used to store carbon dioxide
