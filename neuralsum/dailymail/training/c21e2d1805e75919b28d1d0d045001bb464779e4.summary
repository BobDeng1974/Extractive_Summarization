by @entity0 this could be the most lucrative ‘ light - bulb moment ’ ever			1
an artwork which consists of nothing more than lights turning on and off in an empty room is expected to fetch up to £ 70,000 when it is auctioned by @entity8 ’s next month			1
but the winning bidder will not even get the bulbs or switches needed to recreate the controversial piece – just a certificate of authenticity , signed by @entity16 artist @entity15 , giving permission to use the idea			1
bright idea : @entity16 artist @entity15 's @entity20 127 , which consists of light bulbs being turned on , pictured above , and off , is expected to fetch £ 70,00 when it is auctioned by @entity8 in @entity22 next month the winning bidder will not get the bulbs or switches needed to recreate the piece but will receive a certificate of authenticity , signed by the @entity28 - winning artist , giving permission for the person to use the idea the work has split the art world , with critics claiming it is the ultimate example of the ‘ emperor ’s new clothes ’ while others celebrate a radical example of ‘ art as an idea ’			1
@entity8 is understood to be employing an electrician to set up its own version of @entity20 127 : the lights going on and off so potential buyers can experience a room switching from light to darkness every 30 seconds			1
@entity48 , the head of the @entity49 of traditionalist artists , condemned @entity15 ’s installation as ‘ a mundane experience ’ rather than a work of art. he said : ‘ it ’s not so much a question of the lights going on and off it ’s a question of the brain going on and off			1
‘ people are effectively being asked to pay £ 70,000 for something they could reproduce quite easily in your own home			0
it just shows the complete madness of the current thinking in the art world			0
’ @entity15 , 46 , created the work in 1995 as a precursor to his near - identical piece no 227 : the @entity69 – this time at five - second intervals – which went on to win the @entity28 in 2001			1
the decision to award @entity15 the £ 20,000 prize proved to be one of the most controversial in the competition ’s history and protesters picketed the ceremony			1
@entity78 , pictured right , presented the @entity28 to mr @entity15 , pictured left , when he won the prestigious award for a near - identical piece of work , called no 227 , in 2001 @entity78 , who subsequently presented the award , described art prizes as ‘ silly ’ and said there could be no correlation between good art and money			1
but she said : ‘ i want to support any artist who not only has something to say but the balls to say it			2
’ work no 227 was subsequently bought by the @entity90 for more than £ 100,000 , and it could be another gallery that buys no 127 at @entity8			1
it is being sold by the current owner , a private collector			0
for your own @entity95 - winning work , follow our simple instructions : 1 ) depress light switch as illustrated			1
2 ) wait 30 seconds			0
3 ) repeat until you are offered £ 70,000			0
or have an electrician install a timer for £ 200			0
@entity15 is now regarded as one of the leading conceptual artists in the country			2
other works have included a sheet of @entity109 paper scrunched up into a ball ( no 88 ) , a lump of kneaded @entity112 stuck on a wall ( no 79 ) , and athletes running through the galleries of @entity116 ( no 850 )			0
@entity117 , the head of @entity118 , said of the lights installation : ‘ it ’s only an artwork in the narrow loopy confines of the modern contemporary art establishment			0
@entity8 are just selling pretentious junk to chumps who want to buy into “ cool ”			2
” but sir @entity127 , one of @entity116 ’s most respected art historians , said : ‘ i am a fan of @entity15 and i think he has a place			2
his work is not over heavy			0
it ’s very slight and sexy and good fun			0
i can see the point			0
’ sir @entity127 said he probably would n’t want @entity20 127 in his front room , but added : ‘ art is not like that			2
you do n’t have to like it			0
but if you are involved in the language and the discourse of art then yes it is art. ’ other works in the @entity145 in @entity22 , on july 1 will include @entity147 ’s @entity146 – being sold by @entity148 for an estimated £ 1 million – and a portrait of the artist @entity150 by @entity151 , which was owned by @entity153 and is valued at up to £ 12 million			1
@entity15 was last night unavailable for comment .			2
