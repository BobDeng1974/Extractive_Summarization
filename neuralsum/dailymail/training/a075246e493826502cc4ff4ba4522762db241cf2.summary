@entity1 leader @entity0 has been accused of putting ‘ fear in people ’s hearts ’ by scaremongering about immigration in a ferocious attack by a @entity5 minister			1
@entity9 told mr @entity0 ' i do n't like your tone ' and accused him of spreading ‘ prejudice ’ instead of using facts			1
the outspoken defence minister also appeared to draw parallels between @entity1 and the rise of fascism , claiming mr @entity0 was using tough economic times to ‘ turn to the stranger and you blame them ’			1
@entity39 has been careful not to repeat his 2006 claim that @entity1 is a ‘ bunch of fruit cakes and loonies and closet racists ’ , insisting he will now not ‘ insult ’ those who have chosen to support the @entity44 party			1
there was anger in @entity51 when veteran cabinet minister @entity52 suggested some @entity1 politicians are racists and its members are ' clowns '			1
his remarks , which came just days before the local elections in may , which saw huge gains for mr @entity0 's party , were disowned by colleagues			1
however , appearing on @entity30 ’s @entity29 last night ms @entity9 tore into mr @entity0 ’s populist anti-immigration rhetoric			1
ms @entity9 said : ‘ i do n't like your tone , mr @entity0			1
you do not talk facts			2
that ’s what you talk			2
you scaremonger and you put fear in people ’s hearts			2
‘ look , times are tough			0
but when times are tough , there ’s a danger and history tells us when things are not good , you turn to the stranger and you blame them			0
‘ and you should n’t			0
and i ’m proud of our country ’s history and i ’m proud that people come here			0
’ @entity9 describes herself as a ' tough old bird ' and is not afraid to speak her mind , even if it is not government policy			1
the former tv presenter fronted @entity87 in the 1980s and retrained spent 15 years as a barrister before being elected mp for @entity90 in 2010			0
the single mother - of - two was quickly promoted to public health minister , but complained she was only given the job because it is ' a soft bloody girly option '			2
she also warned rebellious @entity94 to stop ' quite a lot of t * * * * * * * ' and focus on winning the election			0
later , she said it was possible to tell a poor person because they were often fat , complained about the size of cakes and said eating a sandwich at your desk is ' disgusting '			0
in last month 's reshuffle she was moved to become the first @entity5 woman minister at the @entity108			1
the searing critique came after mr @entity0 again warned of the threat of an influx of @entity112 and @entity113 into the @entity38 when working restrictions are lifted next year			1
he said he warned about a similar increase in immigration from @entity117 a decade ago			2
the @entity119 government predicted a population increase of 13,000 people per year , he said			0
‘ i said that was nonsense because logic said if you extend to poor people the ability to come to a rich country they ’ll come in huge numbers			0
and in the first two years , 800,000 people came			0
that … is a fact			0
’ but during angry exchanges , a member of the audience accused him of ‘ bandying about figures ’ and ‘ scaremongering ’			0
the government has refused to provide an official estimate for the number of people expected to come from @entity139 and @entity112 , but privately expect it to be much lower than those from @entity117 because @entity38 is among the last countries to lift the restrictions			1
ms @entity9 said : ‘ people come here to work			2
' they come to @entity31 to work and they work in the fields as you know			0
‘ the real debate is about why there are so many people in our country who choose not to work			0
i do n’t like your tone mr @entity0			2
‘ you talk about facts – in my constituency your party put out a leaflet saying 29 million people from @entity112 and @entity113 were going to flood into our country			0
' the population is only 27.5 million of the two of them			0
’ but mr @entity0 insisted young people in @entity38 were unable to find jobs because wages had been undercut by migrant workers			1
criticism : the @entity94 had moved to tone down attacks on @entity1 , after @entity39 called them ' fruitcakes and racists ' in 2006 and earlier this year @entity52 dismissed the party as ' clowns ' today he hit back , branding ms @entity9 's attack ‘ pretty unpleasant ’			1
mr @entity0 said : ‘ i do n’t like it but it is exactly what i expect			2
the main motivation of the political class in this country is its own self - perpetuation and there is no depth to which they are not prepared to stoop to try and maintain that status quo			0
‘ they are getting very concerned about @entity1 but i think their fear is now broader than just the @entity192 elections , ' he told the @entity193			1
' you only have to look at the results from district and country council by - elections up and down the country to see that @entity1 is very consistently and clearly out - performing its poll - ratings			2
' people are beginning to vote @entity1 in domestic elections as well as in @entity192 elections			1
