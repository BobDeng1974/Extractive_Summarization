by @entity0 for the @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 @entity3 are unbeaten in their past five matches against @entity5 — the longest undefeated spell in 110 years of playing the @entity7			1
he did what all top strikers should			0
with time ticking away and a crucial match on the brink of being lost , @entity11 saved the day			2
getting his head to a cross from @entity16 and diverting it beyond @entity17 as a pulsating game entered its 90th minute , @entity11 sped away after rescuing a point , sliding on his knees into the corner of @entity22 where @entity5 ’s supporters celebrated			1
@entity11 was crucial in turning the tide			2
his fizzing volley , which sped over @entity17 ’s bar , gave @entity5 a jolt of confidence a minute after he replaced the ineffectual @entity29 ; he provided his team with belief , a presence and , ultimately , a reward for their laboured efforts			1
there has to be a ‘ but ’			0
@entity11 may have scored 16 times in the last @entity55 campaign and won the @entity56 but many , notably @entity58 , have questioned if the @entity60 striker will ever be the 25 - goal man to take @entity5 up a level			1
‘ how sure are you he wo n’t be that man ? ’ asked @entity36 , who is likely to be without @entity11 against @entity62 on wednesday			1
‘ what he demonstrated when he came on was convincing			0
‘ @entity11 is improving every year			2
i would n’t rule out he will get 25 goals			0
all our opponents have been looking for strikers as well and nobody has found a world - class one available better than the one they have			0
’ strength : @entity74 tries to get the ball off the @entity5 forward but he proved a tough opponent doubt : @entity11 left the ground in a protective boot but if he stays fit could score many more goals this season slow start : new signing @entity29 has not hit the ground running on the wing or up front for @entity5 there was more support for @entity11 from @entity89 , whose 83rd - minute goal gave @entity5 a lifeline			1
‘ i like playing with him because i can run off him and he can play me in , ’ said @entity89			0
‘ he got a load of goals for us last season , he was our top scorer			2
he is very valuable to this team			0
’ many @entity5 fans were excited to see @entity29 get the nod as the lone centre forward against @entity3 , but @entity102 ’s @entity101 star struggled to impose himself against @entity3 centre halves @entity104 and @entity105			1
before his half - time substitution , @entity29 managed just 26 touches — none of which were in @entity3 ’s penalty area			1
it was down to much - maligned striker @entity11 to bring @entity5 ’s attack more purpose			1
yet does @entity36 still need another forward before the window closes ? in the opening half , when @entity29 looked woefully off the pace , you would have said yes			1
@entity36 , though , is unmoved and says he never considered entering the bidding for @entity121 - bound @entity120			2
‘ we have ( @entity124 ) @entity123 , who will be important , ’ added @entity36			2
‘ we have @entity11 , @entity126 can play centre forward , and of course @entity29 , and @entity129 coming back			1
' you do n’t put a pot of players together and bring in people just to have them there			0
the transition was better in the second half when we had the ball			2
’ it is to @entity5 ’s credit they hauled themselves off the floor , having been run ragged for 45 minutes , as goals from @entity141 and @entity142 threatened to see @entity3 repeat the 3 - 0 savaging they inflicted in april			1
they would have seen the game out had they taken a couple of chances in the second period			0
that explains why @entity148 is looking for another striker before the window closes , with @entity152 and @entity153 contenders			0
‘ there is a lot of money involved in those two ( deals ) , ’ said the @entity3 manager			0
‘ i am looking at all options			0
our first half shows what we have got in the squad			0
it is about how we are going to do that over 90 minutes			0
’ one back : @entity89 arrives in the six - yard box to score the @entity7 ' first goal and start the comeback better together : @entity89 praised his teammate @entity11 , saying he gets the best out of those around him			1

@entity11 comes on at half time to *inspire* @entity5
@entity42 striker heads home in last minute to earn @entity7 an unlikely point
@entity36 says he is confident in his player 's *ability* to lead the line this season
@entity29 removed after 45 ineffectual minutes
