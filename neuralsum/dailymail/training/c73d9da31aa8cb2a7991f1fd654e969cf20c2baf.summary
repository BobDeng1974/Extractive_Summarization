@entity0 has been warned he faces ‘ catastrophe ’ at the next election if @entity2 continues to haemorrhage support in @entity4 to the nationalists			1
senior party figures believe as many as 15 of its 41 seats north of the border are at risk – putting @entity2 ’s hopes of victory at @entity14 in may under threat			1
one former @entity4 first minister said that , just weeks on from helping to win the independence referendum , @entity2 risked ‘ snatching defeat from the jaws of victory ’			1
she accused mr @entity0 of treating @entity2 like a ‘ branch office ’ and dubbed some @entity33 ‘ dinosaurs ’			1
two new polls , covering the whole of @entity36 , showed that both @entity2 and the @entity37 were tied on 33 per cent of the vote , with just over six months to go before the next election			0
@entity2 has traditionally relied on the near - certainly of a large number of seats in @entity4 to help it on the way to general election success			1
but the @entity45 , resurgent despite losing the referendum , is threatening to take a large number of their seats			0
@entity4 's first minister @entity49 accused mr @entity0 of being responsible for the ‘ meltdown ’ of @entity2			1
former @entity2 first minister , @entity51 , told @entity52 that mr @entity0 had ‘ not got a clue about the realities of @entity4 politics ’			1
‘ what we ’ve got is a situation after a decade that labour is still in denial in the @entity36 and if there ’s any hiccup in the number of mps we sent to @entity14 in 2015 this could be catastrophic for @entity0 ’s effort to become prime minister , ’ he said			2
he questioned whether @entity2 could ‘ survive as a social democratic party in the modern age ’			0
‘ electors are unwilling to vote the same way as previous generations , ’ he said			0
‘ the power of @entity2 is diminishing and will continue to do so			0
’ @entity73 quit as @entity2 yesterday , accusing mr @entity0 of treating the party north of the border like a ‘ branch office ’ and describing some @entity33 as ‘ dinosaurs ’ miss @entity78 has said the final straw came when the @entity36 party sacked the @entity2 general secretary , @entity81 , last week without consulting her			1
@entity82 , another @entity2 ex-first minister of @entity4 , said the issue of authority between the @entity4 and @entity36 @entity2 parties needed to be sorted out once and for all			0
‘ [ the referendum victory ] should have been an amazing opportunity for @entity2 to set out its vision and values for @entity4 , ’ said lord @entity82			1
‘ we are in serious danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of that victory and it really is time for all of those in positions of responsibility to get a grip , to sort out this issue of authority once and for all			0
‘ and then for us to have a debate and the election of a new leader who can take us forward , not thinking about the internal workings of the @entity80 , but with a vision to be first minister of @entity4 and help change this country for the better			0
’ @entity2 's executive committee met today to discuss the process and timetable for selecting a new leader			2
among those tipped for the leadership are @entity117 and interim leader @entity118			0
@entity119 has also been linked to the role but reports have suggested the former prime minister has ruled himself out of the running			0
a new group of @entity2 activists want the party north of the border to make radical changes , such as changing the name to the @entity130 and becoming fully autonomous from @entity2 's @entity132 leadership			2
the @entity2 for @entity4 group also supports @entity134 being given full control over income tax as well as complete responsibility for welfare - a position which goes further than @entity2 's existing plans for further devolution .			2

senior @entity2 figures think 15 out of 41 seats in @entity4 are now at risk
collapse north of the border could scupper @entity0 's hopes of being *pm*
@entity2 leader @entity29 *dramatically* resigned yesterday
accused @entity0 of treating @entity2 like a ‘ branch office ’
