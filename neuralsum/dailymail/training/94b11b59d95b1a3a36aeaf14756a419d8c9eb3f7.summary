ahead of the second semi-final , @entity0 runs the rule over @entity3 and @entity4 as both nations bid to face @entity6 in the @entity8 final			1
they have been two of the stand - out players at the tournament and @entity13 and @entity14 go head to head			1
whichever team stops the other ’s star man will go a long way to reaching the final			2
with three central defenders , the temptation for @entity4 is to send one after @entity13 , but these days he is doing much more of his work in a deeper position			2
you rarely see man - marking these days but if any manager is going to try something different , it ’s @entity41			1
the structure of the @entity44 team seems better than @entity3 ’s and they work the ball more patiently			1
then when it reaches the front three the pace quickens			0
@entity14 is ruthless when he isolates defenders and as effective as @entity13 one - on - one			1
defenders ca n’t afford to dive in against him because if a foot is offered , @entity14 will go over it			2
@entity13 has dragged this @entity3 team through but he performs much better when his fellow strikers are firing			1
@entity54 finally came to the party with that fine finish against @entity57 and @entity13 always looks better with a partner in crime			1
he has a big role to play , though i ’m sure @entity62 would like to be able to have @entity63 back in his side soon			0
in - form : @entity54 is getting among the goals at exactly the right time kick - off : 9pm , @entity69 , @entity70			1
@entity71 : live it v 1 from 8.30pm ; @entity73 & @entity74			0
referee : @entity76 ( @entity77 )			0
this will be a close game but i think the @entity44 will go through , thanks in part to their inspirational manager			2
@entity27 got his players together early to prepare for the @entity8 and he pays such attention to detail			1
his decision to bring on @entity88 against @entity89 for the penalties was inspired			0
everything has been going @entity27 ’s way so he may feel cocky enough to try another tactical tweak tonight			0
i ’ve been impressed by his coaching staff , too — they are his lieutenants on the sidelines , all playing individual roles and feeding him information			0
that way his head is n’t buried in a notebook and he can focus on the game and his tactics			0
the main man : @entity41 's tactical nous and ability to make big calls is a massive boost for @entity4 @entity109 hopeful on @entity111 fitness @entity3 have only beaten @entity4 once in all competitions — in the 1978 final one of the most interesting things about this @entity8 has been the flexible systems and the refusal of players to be pigeon - holed			1
@entity118 has played in three positions and excelled in them all			0
he has been magnificent as a wing back but his experience as a striker also gives him a creative and attacking edge			0
mr @entity125 : @entity118 has proved to be a vital cog in @entity27 's machine @entity128 is unrecognisable from the @entity130 defender of last season , with his flowing locks long gone			2
he was impressive against @entity57 , dealing well with their more direct approach , but against the speed of @entity137 , it will be a different test altogether			0
the man in the middle : @entity128 is back in the @entity3 starting line - up			2

@entity13 has been @entity3 's best player at the tournament while @entity14 has been in *sizzling* form for the @entity44
will @entity41 *opt* to man mark @entity13 ?
@entity54 hit the winner against @entity57 and his rise to form can help @entity3
but @entity27 is a *footballing* genius and his nous can steer the @entity44 through for a repeat of the 1974 @entity8 final
