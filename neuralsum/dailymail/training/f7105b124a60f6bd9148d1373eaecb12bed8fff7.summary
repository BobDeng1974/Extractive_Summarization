just three weeks after training with the @entity1 , @entity0 put his training into practice , dramatically saving the lives of his family and girlfriend in @entity7			1
the student , 20 , from @entity9 in @entity10 , hired a motorboat with his parents and girlfriend in @entity14 , in northern @entity15 , to reach a secluded bay only accessible by water			1
as they travelled further away from the shore , the weather took a turn for the worse , the sea became choppy and water began to fill the boat			1
@entity0 , with his girlfriend @entity25 : the student acted fast when his family 's boat capsized his parents @entity30 , 55 , and @entity31 , 53 , and girlfriend @entity25 , 22 , also a student , were unable to reach their life jackets because the wind was so strong it held them at the rear of the boat			1
@entity0 edged his way to the front of the boat to get the life jackets - almost falling into the water as he went - and found there were only three on board			1
handing them to the others , he braced himself for the boat to capsize in the waves crashing around them			2
the boat overturned and @entity0 's father , @entity30 , a manager at a freight company , became trapped underneath			1
life saver : @entity0 , pictured right , with @entity25 said he thought he and his family got off lightly @entity0 quickly swam below the waves and pulled him free and all four clung to the overturned hull which was drifting around half a mile off shore			1
the family was rescued when a passing yacht spotted them and hauled them on board			0
@entity0 , a @entity60 student at @entity61 , had recently passed a lifeguarding course , one of many courses offered by the @entity1			1
he said : ' i feel that we got off lightly			0
it could have been a lot worse			0
i think it was down to the fact that training allowed me to act			0
' the beach seemed like an eternity away			0
we were out way too far and could only hope for a miracle			0
' holiday hell : @entity0 's family were rescued when a passing yacht spotted them and hauled them on board he added : ' i never dreamed that i 'd need the skills i learned on the lifeguard course so quickly and that it would help my own family			2
it was quite a shock afterwards			0
' his mother , @entity31 , said : ' i was really panicking , i dread to think what would have happened if @entity0 was n't there			2
i am so proud of my son , he is amazing			0
' it was very lucky he 'd done the course just before we went , either way we would have got on that boat , it was just by chance he knew what to do and selflessly gave us the life jackets			0
' only when we got on the yacht did we realise @entity0 had badly cut his knee and it was pouring with blood - he did n't make a fuss at all			2
