a few weeks ago , @entity15 noticed that money left inside his truck was continuously vanishing			2

smile for the camera : @entity24 was caught on hidden camera breaking into one of his client 's trucks as the man was exercising @entity15 was shocked to discover that it was n't a family member who had been repeatedly burglarizing his truck , rather it was his personal trainer , @entity24 , and it happened in the parking lot of the gym where the two men met for @entity15 's training sessions			1
the video - which @entity15 turned over to police and a local television station in @entity41 , about 100 miles southeast of @entity42 - shows @entity24 entering his truck , opening the center console and taking something that @entity15 says was money			1
' it 's pretty self explanatory ; [ @entity24 's ] hand went in empty and came out with green stuff , ' @entity15 says of the video during an interview with @entity52			2

that video also shows @entity24 entering @entity15 's truck and leaving with something in his hand			2
busted : @entity24 was caught on hidden camera burglarizing his client 's truck ' i have outside footage and i also have inside camera showing what i caught him doing , ' @entity15 says			1
' it is what it is ; i ca n't do anything about it			0
i 'm just glad that it 's not happening anymore			0
' @entity15 says he would often leave his wallet in his truck when he went into the gym to workout , thinking it would be safer there than in one of the gym 's lockers			0
' the only thing i ever took in there was the key			0
who would have thought that somebody would go into my locker , get a key out and go in my truck ? especially my trainer , ' he says			0
' i mean it just goes to show you , you ca n't trust anybody , ' @entity15 continues			0
mystery solved : @entity15 initially thought family members were burglarizing his car until he installed a hidden camera to catch the thief @entity15 says that he 's glad the mystery has been solved and he will continue to work out at the same gym - however , he 'll most likely be hiring a new trainer			1
' it took me a bunch of money to figure out it was n't a family member , a bunch of time , a bunch of patience , and a bunch of good friends , ' @entity15 says			2
