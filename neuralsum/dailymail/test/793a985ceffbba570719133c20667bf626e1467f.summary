former @entity1 and @entity3 coach @entity2 admits he was shocked by @entity5 's decision to switch codes but , on reflection , believes it could be an inspired decision			1
@entity5 , 34 , the greatest captain in @entity1 ' history , stunned the world of rugby league with his sudden announcement that he will quit the sport at the end of the season and join the @entity1 ' sister club @entity15 on an 18 - month contract			1
@entity5 , who is closing in on third place in rugby league 's all - time scoring list with 3,997 points , told a news conference at @entity23 he did not want to play against @entity1 and that the opportunity to spearhead @entity15 's bid for a @entity27 return was too good to resist			1
@entity1 captain @entity5 is to switch codes and join @entity15 at the end of the season @entity5 ( centre ) lifts the @entity32 trophy after @entity1 beat @entity33 in the grand final in october 2012 @entity33 coach @entity2 ( left ) speaks with fellow coaches @entity36 and @entity38 @entity2 , who was in charge of the @entity1 when @entity5 lifted the first of their six @entity32 titles in 2003 , says he is sad to see his former skipper swap codes			1
' i was a bit shocked , ' @entity2 said			2
' it took me a couple of minutes to think about it			2
he 's a champion player , he 's been a champion player for his club and his country for many years			1
' i 'm sad to lose him to that other code			2
however , i could understand the rationale			2
if it 's a way of him plying his trade for longer - his trade of playing rugby and being a terrific professional - i can see why he 's made that change			1
' i think he 'll have a lot to still contribute to their sport and to that club			1
it 's not a huge switch for him in terms of training venues			0
' he 'll still have his bumps and bruises , but the fact that he can continue to do that and probably get well rewarded for it , i ca n't blame him			0
' @entity5 , whose bombshell announcement came just four days after his predecessor as @entity3 captain @entity76 revealed he would be leaving @entity1 at the end of the season to become football manager at @entity80 , has missed @entity1 ' last two games through injury and , according to @entity2 , is probably stepping down at the right time			1

' you ca n't keep playing forever and , when those young guys come snapping at your heels , it 's hard to keep them at bay at some stage			0
' you have to bite the bullet and step aside and i 'd say the time is probably right			0
i 'm no expert on when other people should retire but i 'm pleased for @entity5 and he 'll certainly give everything he 's got to his new employers			1
' that 's how he 's been in rugby league and i 've got no reason to think it 'll be any different			0
' @entity5 has never played rugby union but already identified a role for himself in his new sport as he follows in the footsteps of @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111			1
' ideally i 'd like to play fly - half , ' @entity5 said			1
' it 's the position that suits the skill set i have the best			0
@entity5 and his @entity1 team - mates celebrate after beating @entity116 in the @entity117 ' i understand the challenge that 's in front of me and the difficulties rugby league players have faced crossing over			1
that 's why i think i 'm in the best possible place to help with that transition			0
' playing union is something i 've always wanted to do			0
i did n't want to end my career and have regrets about missed opportunities			2
when this opportunity came up i knew it was the right thing			0
' i 'm excited by it			0
i know the potential at the club and it 's something i 'd like to be a part of			2
' i 'm very respectful of the game and i like watching it			0
i think a lot of rugby league people look down on rugby union , and i think a lot of rugby union people look down on rugby league			0
but i like both games			0
as a sportsman , to get the opportunity to play another professional sport is something that really appeals to me			0
