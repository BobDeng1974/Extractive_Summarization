crowded trains , congested roads and signal failures often causes commuter journeys to take far longer than they should			2
but some parts of the @entity5 are far more willing to put up with a long commute than others , and this fascinating interactive map reveals the divide			2
it shows how the eastern states have some of the longest journey times to work , while parts of the south west and mid-west boast the shortest commuter times			1
the map shows how this compares to the rest of the @entity5			0
most places , particularly in the east , have a longer commute , as indicated by the brown and darker brown shades created by @entity30 at @entity31 , you can click on each county on the map - which can be viewed here - to see the average commute times for workers			1
counties coloured green have a lower average commute time , and brown means a longer average commute time			1
@entity42 , meanwhile , shows commute times that are about the same			2
