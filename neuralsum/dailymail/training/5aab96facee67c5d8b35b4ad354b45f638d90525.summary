a worried member of the public called police after hearing the muffled shouting coming from near a disused coppermine in woods above the @entity15 , @entity16			1
police sent a specialist dog handler and a team of officers to investigate while mountain rescue teams were also called in			1
search : a team of 20 police officers spent eight - and - a - half hours scouring woodland after a dog walker heard cries of ' help ! ' - which were actually from a woman shouting for her dog @entity7 emergency search : police were told within half an hour that a dog walker had been shouting at her pet in the area - but they carried on searching for a further eight hours anyway officers spent eight - and - a - half hours combing a small area of woodland yesterday searching for the ' trapped ' woman			1
but last night they were forced to call off their search after realising the cries were almost certainly a dog walker shouting the name of her pet			1
officers arrived on the scene at around 8am yesterday , and ' fairly quickly ' established that another woman regularly exercised her dog in the area			2
she was contacted at around 8.30 am , and confirmed that she had been in the area , and had indeed been shouting for her pet			2
however , half an hour later , just as this was beginning to look like the explanation , police received further calls from two more people , insisting they had again heard a woman 's voice shouting ' help '			1
police eventually abandoned the search shortly after 5pm last night after finding no evidence of an emergency			1
@entity62 : the search went on in in woods above the @entity15 , @entity16 , yesterday a police spokesman said they were confident they had carefully searched the area , and had done all that could be done			1

his body was found in the spring , in open countryside , not far from the woods			0
@entity108 , 63 , who lives on the hill , said : ' i think perhaps people are more wary now when they hear things after the young student was found in the field not far from here			0
