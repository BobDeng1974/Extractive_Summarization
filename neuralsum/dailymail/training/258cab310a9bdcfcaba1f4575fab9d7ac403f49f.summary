by @entity0 published : 05:06 est , 4 may 2012 updated : 09:46 est , 4 may 2012 @entity1 has admitted to profiting from his car mileage scam a bogus car dealer made thousands of pounds by wiping the mileage off cars before selling them on to unassuming drivers			1
@entity1 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , profited in excess of £ 100,000 in just 10 months after buying a fleet of vans at auction then tampering with their mileage			1
people who bought the vans complained to @entity17 after noticing there was an unusual amount of wear and tear for their mileage			2
in one case he reduced the mileage of a @entity24 by more than 275,000miles from 364,370 to just 89,000			1
when cross-referenced with auction house records with @entity27 records it was discovered he had taken more than 200,000 miles off another @entity24 van before selling it to a plumber in @entity33			1
@entity34 forked out £ 6,319 for the vehicle which @entity1 had bought for £ 4,423 at auction just weeks earlier			0
@entity37 , contracts manager for @entity34 , bought the 55 - registration @entity24 from @entity1 who claimed it had clocked a mere 76,000 miles when in fact it had done 276,000			1
mr @entity37 said : ' i was looking for a larger van and when i saw the @entity24 it looked ideal			1
it was five years old when we bought it , so the 76,000 miles quoted in the advert was reasonable for a commercial vehicle			2
' the price was a little bit lower than the dealer prices i ’d seen for the same model but because i thought i was buying privately i was n’t suspicious			0
' when i went to see the van it looked in good condition and mr @entity1 seemed a genuine character			2
he told us the vans he sold were all supplied by the same company			2
' we had the @entity58 - checked - which it passed - and went ahead and bought it			0
' @entity61 will be sentenced today at @entity63 crown court for the series of offences after altering the milometer readings and tidying the bodywork , @entity1 typically advertised the vans at between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 more than he had paid for them at auction			1
@entity17 officers sifted through documents and sales records relating to 123 vehicles , 111 of which had already been sold			0
the remaining 12 vehicles found in @entity1 ’s possession were seized			0
only four of the 123 vehicles had not had their milometer readings altered			0
in total , 22 of the vehicles had milometer readings reduced by 100,000 miles or more , with two vans having more than 200,000 miles wiped off their real mileage			1
councillor @entity85 , @entity86 member for community safety at @entity88 , said : ' the extent of the vehicle clocking in this case is absolutely shocking			0
' mr @entity1 not only ripped off unsuspecting buyers , he placed their safety at risk by making them think they were driving a vehicle with much less wear and tear			0
' @entity1 , has admitted 10 counts of fraud and will be sentenced at @entity100 today			1
his then - partner , @entity102 , was cleared of any involvement in the fraud at an earlier hearing			0
following sentencing , @entity17 ’ proceeds of crime team will begin proceedings to recoup profits @entity1 has made from the van scam .			0
