by @entity0 published : 18:59 est , 30 july 2013 updated : 03:41 est , 31 july 2013 cleared : oil and banking heir @entity1 was accused of hacking ex-wife @entity3 , the @entity4 tycoon law firms were revealed last night to be the single biggest user of corrupt private detectives who hacked , blagged and stole private information			1
they made up a fifth of 102 companies and groups uncovered as clients of a network of investigators jailed last year			1
mps released a detailed break - down of the secret list outlining how 22 law firms paid for their shady services			2
the disclosure will fuel the growing clamour for companies and individuals linked to the so - called blue - chip hacking scandal to be named publicly			1
@entity26 and the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) have been accused of protecting corporate clients and celebrities uncovered in their inquiries			1
members of the @entity32 are concerned that those who paid others to steal and blag information have escaped the same scrutiny as the media			2
they are also angry that the government has failed to regulate and license the thriving , but little known , private detective industry			0
speaking last night , @entity39 , who chairs the committee , said he is determined to name those involved as soon as possible			1
the senior @entity43 mp met @entity27 director - general @entity44 yesterday and told him he is ‘ concerned ’ that the list is classified			1
he said releasing the number of firms in each category is an ‘ important step towards establishing the facts ’			0
' important step ' : senior labour mp @entity39 , who chairs the @entity32 , said he is determined to name those involved as soon as possible he added : ‘ it is in the public interest for the information to be available at the appropriate time , not for this saga to drag on			1
’ the breakdown revealed that a huge range of firms and individuals paid for the services of the group of private investigators			0
following law firms , the next largest group was fellow private investigators ( 16 ) , followed by insurers ( ten ) and financial service companies ( eight )			1
a string of other white collar professions linked to them include accountants , auditors , debt collectors and even an oil and medical supply company			1
two celebrities are among the names , as well as seven other individuals seeking sensitive information about others			0
@entity26 holds the names of five further companies and individuals that it has been investigating since late 2011			1
calls : metropolitan police commissioner sir @entity88 has also been asked to release suppressed information from four investigations into rogue private detective agencies the suspects are under scrutiny as part of @entity95 , an offshoot of inquiries into phone hacking and the bribing of public officials for information			1
the @entity103 ’s flagship radio news programme finally turned its attention to the secret hacking scandal yesterday – at 6.36am when not many would be listening			2
the four - minute item was the first mention by the today programme despite weeks of newspaper reports of how shady private eyes hacked , blagged and stole information			0
the @entity112 and other newspapers have raised serious concerns that little has been done about the criminal activities of private eyes commissioned by major companies			2
despite revelations in recent days that 102 companies featured on a list given to mps by the @entity27 , the story has merited barely a mention on @entity123 and tv programmes or online			1
it contrasts with the blanket coverage given by the @entity103 to revelations of phone hacking in the media			0
yesterday , the @entity132 force confirmed those in the spotlight are ‘ outside of the media industry ’ as it defended its refusal to identify them			0
a spokesman said the ‘ live investigation ’ could be endangered if the names were released			0
commissioner sir @entity88 has also been asked to release suppressed information from four investigations into rogue private detective agencies			0
@entity146 mp @entity145 , who made the request , is particularly interested in a 2007 inquiry known as @entity149			0
it found private eyes of one firm dubbed ‘ hackers are @entity154 ’ were hacking computers and corrupting police officers but no clients were successfully prosecuted			2
the only one to be charged was oil and banking heir @entity1 who hired the company during divorce proceedings against his ex-wife @entity3 , the @entity4 tycoon			0
mr @entity1 was later cleared by a jury who accepted he had no idea the investigators to whom he paid £ 12,000 were breaking the law			0
in a separate development , the @entity112 can reveal that ministers will shortly unveil the first ever statutory licensing regime for private detectives			0
at present , there is nothing in law to distinguish companies that pursue legitimate business activities from ‘ corrupt operatives ’ .			2
