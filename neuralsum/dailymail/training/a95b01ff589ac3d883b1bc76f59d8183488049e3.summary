a private school in @entity1 has reportedly turned away a pair of potential students because their parents are gay			1
the @entity6 had allegedly told @entity7 they 'd host him on a tour of the school he was considering for his children but the visit was cancelled when it was discovered he was raising them with his same - sex partner			1
@entity7 has a son entering pre-kindergarten and an 8 month old daughter he wanted to send to the nondenominational school			1
the @entity6 told @entity7 and @entity20 they could n't teach their children because they were a same - sex couple this rejection letter from the school cited their admissions policy regarding ' unacceptable lifestyle conduct ' the school has no affiliation with any specific church but says it operates in the @entity31 tradition			1
the @entity32 reports that a jan. 14 letter told @entity7 ' another education provider would be a better fit for your children			1
therefore , we can not grant admission to your children			2
' they had not yet officially applied for admission			0
@entity7 , a real estate agent , is married to @entity20			1
@entity20 is the pastor of @entity40			1
the pair wed in @entity42 in 2013 and have raised the children from birth			2
@entity20 put the letter on his @entity47 page , being shared more than 100 times			1
' i am so disappointed in my high school , @entity6 , ' wrote @entity51 , executive director of the @entity52			1
' sad , truly sad			0
hurt deeply and i ca n't sleep			0
' the couple , who have raised the children from birth , wed in 2013 @entity20 said he posted the rejection to ' let my friends know that discrimination affects people you know and love and still hurts no matter how many times you go through it			1
we chose this school because of its rigorous faith - based @entity67 academics and extracurricular activities ; and , a friend with a son there asked them if a family like ours would be allowed and was told yes			1
after a phone conversation , fully disclosing we are a two - dad family , an appointment was set for us			0
i receive this letter canceling our appointment without even getting a chance			2
' he later said he did n't want to ' harm the school ' only show that ' discrimination and inequality is alive and well			2
' ' i want to make that very clear , ' he added			0
' we want our children to have a @entity31 education , and we 're finding that very , very hard			2
' @entity90 's administrators have yet to respond to media requests			0
the pair desperately want their children raised in a @entity31 school but are finding it difficult however @entity96 notes that the letter cited the school 's handbook and admissions policy			1
it states : ' @entity6 has the right and responsibility to do everything possible to ensure that its expressed purposes , mission , and beliefs continue in their highest traditions and are not harmed , compromised , or hindered by unacceptable lifestyle conduct on the part of its students , parents or guardians ... ' the couple say they have no plans to seek legal action against the school			2
a rep from the @entity120 said that if there had been any other incidents of a @entity1 school rejecting a student based on their parent 's orientation , they had n't heard of it			0
but simply seeing the numbers of people sharing the letter online show how mcuh the ' conversation has significantly changed in @entity1			0
' ' discriminating against parents , in this case , has an effect on the child , ' said the group 's executive director @entity139			0
' and i think maybe that 's what is so striking to so many straight allies			0
do you hit an entire family if you have a disagreement with the parents ? that 's why this has legs			0
that 's why this has power			0
that 's why this has emotional impact			0

the @entity6 had told @entity7 and *husband* @entity20 that another school would be ' a better fit for your children '
@entity20 , a pastor , says the pair have been trying to find a @entity31 school for their son in pre-kindergarten and *infant* daughter
