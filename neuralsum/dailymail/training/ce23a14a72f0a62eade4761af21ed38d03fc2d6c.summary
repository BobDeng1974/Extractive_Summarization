by @entity0 published : 22:46 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 02:59 est , 15 february 2013 education secretary @entity2 's reforms of the a-level system have come under fire from the @entity5 of top universities @entity8 's top universities have warned against radical government plans to hive off as - levels as a standalone qualification			1
they said they were ' not convinced ' that the move is necessary , and raised concerns that without a direct link to a-levels , new - style as - levels may not be as beneficial			1
as - levels in their current form are valued by universities , allow students to study a broader range of subjects and can encourage bright pupils from poorer backgrounds to continue their studies , according to the @entity5			1
under a major shake - up of a-levels , announced by education secretary @entity2 last month , as - levels are set to be separated from a-levels to become a qualification in their own right			1
teenagers taking a-levels will no longer sit exams after one year , and will instead be tested at the end of their two - year course			0
setting out his plans , mr @entity2 said he had concluded that there was a ' compelling case ' for a move to a-levels with final exams			0
but dr @entity44 , director general of the @entity5 - which represents a group of 24 universities including @entity47 and @entity48 - suggested they had some concerns about the proposals			2
' as - levels in their existing form are valued by universities , ' she said			1
' we have argued that as - levels in their current format are important in giving students the opportunity to take an additional smaller qualification in a contrasting subject alongside their main a-level subjects			2
' this adds valuable breadth and flexibility to their learning programme , and can encourage the take - up of strategically important subjects			0
' we are not convinced therefore that a new standalone as qualification is necessary and are concerned that , with no links to the a-level , it may not deliver the same benefits as the existing as - levels			2
' the @entity5 says as - levels in their current form allow students to study a broader range of subjects and can encourage bright pupils from poorer backgrounds to continue their studies dr @entity44 said that results from as - levels taken by sixth - formers at the end of their first year of study are useful to universities when looking at applications , particularly for the most competitive courses			1
' without access to such information , it will be even more difficult for our institutions to identify the most talented students from amongst the very many applicants with excellent results at @entity101			0
' as - level results after one year of study can also be effective in giving talented students from poorer backgrounds the confidence to apply to a highly selective university , thus helping to widen participation			0
' dr @entity44 added : ' whilst we have welcomed the government 's review of the modular structure of the a-level , we do not believe this need be extended to the complete removal of the @entity115 examination from the a-level			0
