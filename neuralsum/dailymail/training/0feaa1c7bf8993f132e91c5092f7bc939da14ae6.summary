the students from the @entity6 at the university sang a bawdy chant outside their accommodation as part of their @entity12 celebrations			1
however , several of the lines of the chant were very objectionable			2
including one about disinterring a sexual partner for a reunion			0
the @entity1 hired students to act as ' @entity30 ' , acting as guides to new students			1
one student told the magazine : ' i went out every other night for the rest of the week			0
each night i heard the same chant , still being led by @entity30			2
' as the week progressed , freshers started to lead the chants themselves			1
on the sunday night , whilst on the bus and queueing for the @entity12 ’ finale [ hosted at @entity42 ] , i heard the chant seven times in the space of an hour			2
' one student recorded the controversial chant on their mobile phone before uploading it to the internet			0

as part of the chant , the leader sings a line which is immediately repeated by the group			0
@entity86 , president of the @entity76 said : ' it is unfortunate that in this instance the guidance we provided has not been implemented in the way that we would hope for as a @entity72 , to ensure enjoyment and comfort for all our members			2
' i must however stress that the issue in question has come about as a result of negligence by a minority , and stress that the students ’ @entity76 wishes not to undermine the brilliant hard work put in by all members of the @entity30 team , including both students and staff			0
' this follows an investigation at the @entity110 after a leaflet was distributed to students looking to join the university 's rugby club which was deemed racist , sexist and homophobic			1
