by @entity0 published : 18:06 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 18:06 est , 5 september 2013 water voles may have declined by as much as a fifth in just a few years , a new study mapping their presence across the @entity4 has suggested			1

water voles were once widespread , but numbers crashed by 90 per cent in the 1990s as a result of predation by mink - which have established themselves in the countryside after escaping from fur farms - and loss of riverbank habitat water voles were once widespread , but numbers crashed by 90 per cent in the 1990s as a result of predation by mink - which have established themselves in the countryside after escaping from fur farms - and loss of riverbank habitat			0
data published in 2010 indicated populations in some parts of the country were making a comeback , but new information from the national water vole database and mapping project paints a more gloomy picture			1
the mapping shows the number and extent of key areas for water voles has shrunk and across large parts of the country populations appear to be small , isolated and vulnerable , conservationists said			1
in such areas , water vole populations are at risk from the arrival of @entity23 mink and the impacts of drought , when falling water levels expose underwater burrow entrances to other predators or flooding			1
the latest data , which collates and maps figures from surveys conducted around the @entity4 , suggests the presence of water voles is down by 22 per cent for the period 2007 to 2011 compared to 2004 to 2008			2

some of the fall is down to a reduction in surveying in recent years as the recession has reduced conservation funding and experts said it was hard to assess what was happening to the @entity4 - wide water vole population as there had not been a national survey since 1998			2
but @entity98 of the @entity25 said the latest data was a real cause for concern , and warned : ' not enough is being done to secure this charismatic species â€™ future			0
' there was clear evidence from some areas such as the south of @entity15 that water voles were disappearing fast , he said			2
' strongholds do remain , and these are often located in areas which support more extensive wetland habitats , such as the fens , or head streams in upland areas			0
' we must ensure these strongholds persist and renew efforts to save this much - loved species , through targeted conservation action and sustained monitoring programmes , ' he urged			0
the number of areas for water voles have shrunk and populations appear to be small , isolated and vulnerable , conservationists said			1
in such areas , water vole populations are at risk from the arrival of @entity23 mink ( pictured ) and the impacts of drought conservationists called for more resources to support water vole surveying and conservation projects , saying a clear benefit could be seen from efforts to create and protect suitable habitat and control mink numbers			1
@entity141 , @entity24 national conservation manager and chairman of the @entity4 water vole steering group , which produced the analysis , said : ' creating new habitat helps protect our native species , like water voles and otters , and helps tackle climate change			1
' @entity24 has created nearly 12,400 acres of wetland and river habitats in the last 10 years and we hope to double this in the next 10			0
' added to this , our rivers are at their healthiest for over 20 years , but control of the @entity23 mink is essential if water voles are to benefit from these healthier rivers and new habitats			0
' successful reintroductions of water voles , along with controlling mink , have resulted in new populations in places such as the @entity165 in @entity166 and @entity167 , the experts said			2
