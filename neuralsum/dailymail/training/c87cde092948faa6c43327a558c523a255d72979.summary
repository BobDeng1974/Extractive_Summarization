by @entity0 @entity1 is expected to reveal a radical @entity3 headset for its @entity5 4 games console next month			1
the addon would allow people to play games in @entity9 , and give @entity1 a major boost in its battle against @entity13 's @entity12			1
it would build on tv and movie watching headsets @entity1 showed off at the @entity18 show in @entity19 earlier this year			1
the firm is now expected to reveal a version for its ps4 console the announcement will be made at the @entity28 games developer conference in @entity29 on 17th march , according to @entity30			1
' rumours of @entity1 's @entity34 virtual reality headset have been running rife since last year , but now an inside source has told @entity30 that they 've spent some time with the helmet behind closed doors - and it 's almost ready to be revealed ' the site said			1
it said the headset has already been shown off behind closed doors			2
' the quality and resolution are really , really good , ' one person who has tried it told the site			2
' people will definitely be impressed with what @entity1 's built			1
' the headset will plug into @entity1 's @entity34 games console , allowing players to immerse themselves completely in games			1
the headset is likely to compete with the @entity53 , an eagerly awaiting @entity3 headset shown off earlier this year at @entity18			2
like @entity1 produce , it uses two small lcd screens in a headset to fool the brain into thinking it is seeing a ' real ' world image			1
the headset has motion tracking and the display in the screen reacts accordingly as the player moves their head around			0
the @entity53 works by tracking the player ’s head movements using sensor technology			0
it also uses a new technique called low - latency mitigation that lets the players explore the world as if it was a reality			0
@entity1 's @entity3 headset is expected to look similar to its tv watching version , shown here low - latency mitigation minimises the delay between the eyes seeing an image and processing what it sees			1
this makes the images appear to be happening closer to real time			0
the @entity53 's display shows two unique images , one for each eye , that the player ’s mind fuses into a single stereoscopic 3d view of the virtual world			2
' @entity96 - that 's always been the dream , ' said one @entity53 executive of its headset , pictured			2
the firm recently raised $ 75m to make its product mainstream			0
' over the past 16 months , we ’ve grown from a startup to a company whose technology is poised to change the way we play , work and communicate , ' said @entity110 , ceo of @entity111			0
' 40,000 developers and enthusiasts , as well as a number of great partners , have joined our cause and helped us bring the seemingly impossible to life			0
' this additional infusion of capital , as well as the leadership and experience of @entity122 and @entity123 , will help us take the final steps toward our ultimate goal : making virtual reality something consumers everywhere can enjoy			0
' ' we believe @entity111 will not only alter the gaming landscape but will redefine fundamental human experiences in areas like film , education , architecture , and design			0
' @entity111 is at the tip of the iceberg of its potential , and we ’re incredibly excited to help them change the world , ' said @entity139 , co-founder of @entity140 .			0
