' i remember i asked [ @entity19 ] to drop me off at the hospital , ' he told detectives			1
' then she took the wrong way			0
in my mind , because i was really high , i thought she was going to do something to me			0
i had a knife in my backpack ... and then i did what i did			0
' during this week 's trail it was revealed that immigration officials could have deported @entity11 months before the brutal slaying detective @entity91 said : ' the most important thing that i found or that i noted was the amount of blood that was inside that car ' during closing arguments on thursday , chief deputy @entity97 ’s attorney @entity96 had asked the jury to find @entity11 guilty of first - degree premeditated murder			1
' how much more cruel of an act could this defendant commit against @entity12 ? ' he asked			2
' stabbing her as she fought with her fists and her leg ... six times in the lungs ... leaving her to bleed out			0
@entity111 , if that ’s not cruel , i do n’t know the definition of cruel			0
' during this week 's trail it was revealed that immigration officials could have deported @entity11 months before the brutal slaying after he was held at the @entity15 jail for a few hours on a public intoxication charge in 2010			1
he was released without being fingerprinted and before federal immigration officials were able to file paperwork requesting that he be detained until they could take him into custody because he had overstayed his visa			0
clothes : @entity12 's blood - soaked @entity125 she was wearing on the day she was murdered was also shown to the jury - the slash marks were visible the @entity14 teenager was found dead in the driver 's seat of her car though @entity133 and fingerprints were recovered at the scene of the june 27 , 2010 , crime , it was two and - a - half years before the @entity3 native was arrested because he was not in the police database			1
during the trial the prosecutors ' first witness - the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on @entity12 - described the ' numerous sharp , force injuries ' from the incise wounds and added that six stab wounds were found in the lung alone			1

the medical examiner said @entity12 was alive when the wounds were inflicted and she would have felt great pain			2
outside of the courtroom the disclosure that immigration officials previously tried to take him into custody raised questions about whether local and federal policies had let him slip through the cracks			0
@entity164 was notified of @entity166 ’s 2010 misdemeanor for public intoxication and planned to file paperwork to take custody of him			0
but before he could be fingerprinted he was released by local authorities due to the low - level nature of the charge			0
@entity11 was finally taken into custody when he was arrested for stealing three bottles of champagne from a grocery store			2
@entity178 , spokesman for the @entity179 , told the @entity180 : ' we ’re looking into a black hole here as part of the procedure and it should be a wake - up call for the public to ask how @entity15 handles illegal aliens and what they do when @entity189 does n’t send the paddy wagon			0
' evidence : the blade from the knife used to stab @entity12 13 times in the seat of her car in june 2010 police also found two diaper cloths in the car : one clean in the back and one up front bloodied from @entity12 's wounds ' this is not a case that is about who , ' defense attorney @entity206 had said in his opening statement on monday			1
' this is a case about why			0
it is a perfect storm of tragedy			0
' for two - and - a - half years @entity12 's killing remained one of the area 's most notorious unsolved murders			1
despite finding the murder weapon with fingerprints under the driver 's seat , the dna evidence did n't match anyone in the police database			1
a break in the case came only in april 2012 when @entity225 was arrested for stealing three bottles of @entity228 champagne from a @entity230 , @entity16 shop			0
initially , his lawyers tried to get the case dismissed , claiming that the media 's coverage of the investigation tainted their client 's ability to receive a fair trial since nearly all of the evidence in the case was released before a jury was selected			2
@entity15 circuit court judge @entity240 dismissed that claim last week , saying all of the evidence reported in the @entity37 would come out in trial and that jury members could set aside what they learned in the press			0
@entity12 had just returned home for the summer after her first year studying fashion design at the @entity44			1
she had happily told friends that she had been offered a summer job as a nanny			0
the defendant himself said she had a ' good heart ' for giving him a ride			0
the 19 - year - old was also looking forward to a visit from her boyfriend @entity258 who lived in @entity259			1
around 2:45pm she decided to go to the @entity260 to get her eyebrows done at @entity262			0
it was while leaving the salon that she first encountered @entity11 , standing outside holding his one - year - old daughter			1
@entity11 started his day by going into @entity266 with his daughter to buy $ 400 dollars of @entity28			1
when he got home he smoked three cigarettes dipped in liquid @entity28 before going to the mall with his daughter			2
according to court documents , by the time he approached @entity12 outside the mall , he was having a ' severe @entity28 intoxication ' and asked the young woman to take him and his daughter to the hospital			1
surveillance footage subsequently shows @entity19 's white @entity277 exiting the parking lot			1
taken for a ride : @entity19 agreed to take @entity11 and his one - year - old daughter to the hospital , but was found less than a mile away stabbed to death in her crashed car according to an account given to police by @entity11 , @entity12 accidentally took a wrong turn and he overreacted			1
' @entity12 did nothing wrong , ' a detective paraphrased @entity11 in a report made after his arrest			1
at this point , @entity11 was hallucinating and believed the teen was going to harm his daughter or call the police , so he acted			0
he took out a butcher 's knife from his backpack and stabbed the girl 13 times which caused her to lose control of the vehicle and crash into a ravine on the side of the road			2
@entity11 ditched the knife and left @entity12 to die , fleeing from the vehicle with his daughter through the sunroof			1
a driver spotted the car at 3:34pm , less than half a mile from the mall and called police			0
when police arrived , they found @entity12 belted into her seat and covered in blood with one wheel of the car still spinning			1
but police were stumped when it came to finding the suspect			0
severely intoxicated : @entity11 has spent his day traveling into @entity266 to buy $ 400 dollars of @entity28 with his daughter , and had smoked three cigarettes dipped in the drugs before going to the shopping center even though the knife was left in the car , the dna evidence produced no matches in the police database			1
investigators were certain the killer was a stranger since they had no reason to believe the pretty student had any enemies or was in any trouble			0
they canvassed the area around the mall and collected dna from @entity12 's friends and family , local sex offenders and homeless people around the mall , but again , no matches			2
@entity12 's story was even highlighted on tv show ' @entity342 ' to no avail			2
it was n't until almost two years later that @entity11 was arrested for stealing two bottles of @entity346 at a grocery store in @entity230 , @entity16			2
even then , it took police until last december 10 to make the connection with his prints			0
' [ @entity11 ] was arrested in april for larceny of champagne			0
imagine that ! ' wrote @entity15 police detective @entity355 in an email that day			0
a few days later @entity11 was arrested at his job site in @entity358 , @entity16			0
he said he never told anyone about the killing			0
a search of @entity11 's computer showed that he tracked news of the investigation on his computer .			2

@entity55 was sentenced on thursday to 49 years in prison for the 2010 murder of @entity12
the 19 - year - old fashion student 's body was discovered in the driver 's seat of her crashed car with 13 stab wounds
