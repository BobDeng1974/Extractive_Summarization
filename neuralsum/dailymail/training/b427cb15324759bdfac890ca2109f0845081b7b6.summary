a major investigation by competition watchdogs will challenge the stranglehold of @entity4 ’s big four banks on the finances of families and small businesses			1
@entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 are accused of controlling 77 per cent of the nation ’s 65million personal accounts but offering poor service and rip - off deals			1
the @entity16 says not enough customers are shifting to lenders with high levels of service – reducing choice in the market			1
it is expected tomorrow to announce a formal investigation into the personal current account sector , which is worth some £ 8billion a year to the big banks			1
@entity8 , pictured , has been named as one of the four banks , which also include @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 as offering poor service and rip off deals investigators fear competition has diminished since the financial crash of 2007 - 8 because brands like the @entity35 have been swallowed up by @entity8 , while others have disappeared completely			1
efforts to encourage new small lenders to enter the market have had limited success , with only a few – including @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 – making any real impact			1
there is also damning evidence that the banks continue to fail small businesses by failing to offer loans			1
it was hoped that a system to help people switch bank within seven working days would boost competition , improve service and reduce fees			1
however , relatively few people have done so			2
@entity58 of which ? said : ‘ quicker switching alone will not solve the lack of competition			2
it is clear that the big banks ’ stranglehold on the market continues and that quicker switching alone will not solve the lack of competition or trust in banking			1
‘ @entity70 must expose what ’s at the heart of the problems in this market and propose reform so that it works better for consumers			0
’ he said the public need access to clear information on the running costs of current accounts so they can decide whether to switch			0
official surveys show that satisfaction levels with the big four banks are less than 60 per cent yet their market shares have remained stable			1
there are concerns that customers have been pressured by bank sales staff into taking accounts that carry a monthly fee of up to £ 20 in return for perks of little value ( file picture ) customers find it very difficult to make comparisons between them , reducing competition and driving up charges , particularly on overdrafts			1
the greatest evidence of the failure of competition came with the fiasco surrounding the mis - selling of payment protection insurance			0
the big four banks have had to set aside around £ 22billion in compensation , but only after they were forced			1
and for many years , the banks routinely rejected many customer complaints about @entity113 and other issues , forcing people to turn to the @entity116			1
according to recent figures , up to eight in ten complaints about the mis - sold @entity113 cover received by the ombudsman were first unfairly thrown out by the bank concerned			0
the @entity116 is now beginning to see a growing number of complaints about paid - for packaged current accounts			0
there are concerns that customers have been pressured by bank sales staff into taking accounts that carry a monthly fee of up to £ 20 in return for perks of little value , such as travel policies , breakdown cover and mobile phone insurance – which have led to a 248 per cent increase in complaints			1
if you 're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider			0

interest - paying current accounts @entity188 is tempting desperate savers with its @entity8 current account - offering up to 4 per cent for balances between £ 4,000 and £ 5,000			1
but you will have to pay in at least £ 1,500			0
