@entity0 came from two goals down at @entity2 to secure a 2 - 2 draw with late goals from @entity5 and @entity6 after @entity7 and @entity8 had struck for @entity9			1
here , @entity11 's @entity10 gives his opinion on his performance of the players			0
@entity9 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 @entity15 - 6 assured presence , fast off his line and smart save to deny @entity6			1
@entity19 - 7 few defensive lapses but relentless going forward and a belting header to open the scoring			0
opener : @entity7 popped up on the right - hand side to score @entity9 's first @entity25 - 6 saw off @entity26 with ease but @entity6 offered greater problems			1
@entity29 - 6 another dominant showing but should have seen the game out better			0
@entity32 - 6.5 @entity33 attacking flair as he rampaged forward and impressive defensively			0
@entity35 - 7.5 athletic , dogged and influential in the midfield , setting a breathless tempo for his team			2
slotted : and @entity8 popped up to net the second just before half time @entity43 - 6.5 glorious cross for @entity7 's goal and a reliable shield in the front of the back - four			1
@entity48 - 5.5 costly miss in the first - half when should have scored when clean through on goal			0
@entity51 - 6.5 infectious in his work - rate and a smart finish to put @entity9 2 - 0 up			1
@entity54 - 6 replaced by @entity55 after just 10 minutes , who was his typical tireless self on the left - side			0
strength : @entity0 's defence struggled to deal with the power of @entity61 throughout the first half @entity61 - 6.5 unstoppable run for the second goal but wasteful on the counter in second - half			2
substitutes @entity55 ( for @entity68 , 10 ) , @entity69 ( for @entity61 , 75 ) , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , stones , @entity74			0
@entity75 - 6 for 75 minutes , this was a powerful statement of @entity9 's intentions for this season			2
@entity75 will be irritated that his side lacked the wit to close out out the game			0
two draws to begin the season , both from winning positions			0
one back : @entity5 grabs the ball after scoring the goal that got @entity0 back into the game @entity0 - 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 @entity88 - 5.5 exposed for both goals but little to do as @entity9 sat back in the second half			1
@entity91 - 6 stirring battle with @entity93 but could have offered more when @entity0 attacked			2
@entity94 - 5.5 bright start at @entity0 but sold himself too easily as @entity61 charged through for @entity9 's second			1
@entity97 - 5.5 another victim of @entity61 's power and the @entity100 struggled on his @entity102 return			0
lacking sharpness : @entity104 had a tough afternoon in his first game back for the @entity106 @entity107 - 5 fast asleep as @entity7 stole in to score but great cross for @entity6 's equaliser			1
a @entity5 - 6 tidy in possession and led the comeback as he nipped in to pull one back			2
@entity114 - 5 @entity115 in the middle and must be more influential in these big matches a @entity118 - 6 missed @entity0 's best chance of the first - half showed an attacking spark			2
off the pace : @entity26 struggled before being withdrawn at the interval @entity124 - 4.5 another below par - showing and booked for a rash challenge on @entity43 after the restart			1
@entity127 - 5 @entity128 on the left - side and could n't keep up with @entity7 's attacking forays			1
a @entity26 - 4 hooked after 45 minutes and can have no complaints			2
looked light - weight and miles off - the pace			0
bullet header : @entity6 rescues the @entity106 with a last - minute equaliser substitutes @entity6 ( for @entity26 , 45 ) , @entity137 ( for @entity124 , 74 ) , @entity138 ( for @entity118 , 74 ) , @entity75 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141			1
@entity142 - 6.5 his major summer signing @entity26 was a huge disappointment and @entity6 simply had to come on at the interval			1
@entity142 had the gall to make the change and it paid off			0
a good point but more bite is needed in midfield .			0

@entity6 and @entity5 score two late goals for @entity0
@entity7 and @entity8 had put @entity9 2 - 0 at @entity2
@entity26 and @entity124 struggle for @entity142 's side
@entity7 and @entity35 impressed for @entity158 's team
