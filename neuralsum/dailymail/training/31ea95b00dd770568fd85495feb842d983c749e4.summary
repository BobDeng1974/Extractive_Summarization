by @entity0 published : 12:10 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 06:34 est , 26 february 2013 court case : the family of @entity3 , pictured , have won an injunction preventing protesters from staging demonstrations within 500 metres of their @entity8 home the family of radical preacher @entity3 has won an injunction preventing protesters from demonstrating outside their home			1
his wife and five children were granted an ' anti-harassment ' order by a high court judge in @entity8			1
mr @entity18 also granted them an injunction against various protest groups preventing them misusing private information about the family - such as their names and address			1
the judge stressed that his decision did not prevent organisations from protesting against @entity31 , provided demonstrations take place more than 500 metres from the @entity8 house where they are living			1
the judge pointed out that @entity31 , whose real name is @entity3 , was not a party to the proceedings			0
he emphasised that the case was not concerned with whether ' @entity3 should still be in this country or whether he should be in prison in this country '			0
judge @entity18 also said he was not concerned with whether he or his family ' should be provided with a house financed by the @entity46 taxpayers '			2
it was accepted ' that it is perfectly legitimate ' for there to be protests about his presence in the country and about the house provided to his family			2
the injunctions granted today continued earlier orders made by another high court judge earlier this month			1
the court action for injunctions was brought against a number of groups , including @entity61 , @entity62 and the @entity63 , as well as against ' persons unknown who are intending to assemble outside the home ' of the claimants			1
he said evidence showed that the claimants , including two children under the age of 16 , ' have suffered extreme distress and upset by the actions of demonstrators outside their home '			2
he added that such protests directly outside had ' terrified ' the family , particularly the younger children			2
court hearing : the @entity81 ruling upheld an earlier court decision and rejected an appeal from a number of groups including the @entity63 and @entity62 the judge said he accepted the evidence presented on their behalf that , while demonstrations were taking place , they were ' effectively prisoners in their own home '			1
justice @entity18 added that defendants aimed ' to cause as much misery , not only to @entity3 , but also to his family '			2
he added there was ' powerful evidence ' from the claimants of weekly demonstrations ' with much shouting of abuse ' such as ' @entity3 off our streets ' , ' all @entity97 are terrorists ' and ' just murder him ' - with chanting and shouting lasting for up to six hours			0
in opposing the injunctions , the defendants argued that the orders would interfere with their rights under the @entity111 - in relation to freedom of thought , expression , and of assembly and association			0
rejecting their case , the judge pointed out that each of those rights ' is qualified in the sense that they do not apply in certain circumstances such as where they interfere with the rights of others '			0
as well as the ' anti-harassment ' order , he granted a second injunction restraining the defendants from communicating or disclosing personal matters relating to the wife and children , such as their address , names , names of schools , and also images of them			1
the injunction were brought against a number of groups including the @entity63 the @entity61 and @entity62 ( stock image ) their case was that if the defendants were allowed to communicate such information it was likely to result in further harassment			0
a previous court order already prohibited the release of @entity31 ’s address into the public domain			1
last year , @entity153 judges ruled that evidence from @entity31 ’s former co-defendants , @entity156 and @entity157 , said to have been obtained by torture , could be used against him in a retrial			0
they said : ' the secretary of state has not satisfied us that , on a retrial , there is no real risk that the impugned statements of @entity156 and @entity157 would be admitted probatively against the appellant			0
' mrs may immediately pledged to appeal and told the @entity169 that @entity170 had given assurances about its legal processes			0
she described @entity31 as ' a dangerous man , a suspected terrorist , who is accused of serious crime in his home country of @entity170 '			0
@entity31 was granted bail following the ruling and released from @entity180			0
mrs may ’s appeal against a decision to allow @entity31 to stay in the @entity46 is due to be heard on march 11			1
he has fought deportation to @entity170 - where he was convicted of terror charges in his absence in 1999 - for more than a decade			0
home secretary @entity188 is appealing against a decision to allow @entity3 to remain in the @entity46			1
