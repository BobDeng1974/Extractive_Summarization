by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the first real rain of the test summer forced @entity4 into @entity6 ’s indoor nets temporarily on wednesday where the sound of the @entity10 anthem @entity11 was blaring out while they went about their business ahead of the fourth test			1
certainly the comprehensive win in @entity16 and the subsequent clearing of @entity18 of ‘ abusing and pushing ’ @entity19 has put smiles back on the faces of @entity4 ’s players after nearly a year of abject misery			1
even @entity18 was ‘ less grumpy ’ than usual , according to @entity24 , and the man who is poised to become @entity4 ’s leading @entity27 wicket - taker will take to his home ground without the shadow of suspension hanging over him			1
the end of the matter ? well , all eyes will be on @entity18 in this pivotal match to see whether ‘ @entity54 ’ again allows his alter ego ‘ @entity18 ’ out of his @entity50 attic and unleashes him on the sensitive souls in the @entity53 team			2
@entity39 made a point yesterday of warning against ‘ personal ’ sledging ; pointing out to @entity57 that he may have put on a pound or two of weight , or words to that effect , are the type of verbals that @entity18 must cut out			2
what @entity24 has to ensure is that the leader of his attack can summon the aggression which has helped take him to within 12 wickets of sir @entity70 ’s @entity4 record without crossing the line that he often dangerously treads			1
time to shine : @entity73 speaks to the @entity4 squad ahead of the fourth test two productive matches for @entity18 here and at @entity77 next week should be enough to see that record broken and a series victory for an @entity4 side who are now seeking to replicate their near complete third @entity27 display			1
the @entity4 captain was adamant hat he has no problem with @entity18 ’s conduct and that he does not want the leader of his attack to become all ‘ nicey nicey ’ , which is something he has never been accused of			1
@entity6 , where @entity4 last year retained the ashes before their world fell apart , is set to provide the quickest , bounciest pitch of this @entity92 series and @entity18 was desperate to be available to try to exploit it			1
‘ for him to be playing here means a lot , ’ said @entity24			0
‘ that ’s what the biggest concern was — that he would n’t get to play at @entity6			0
now he can play in a home @entity27 , which i know is special to everyone who does that			1
unfortunately we do n’t play @entity27 at @entity104 , so i do n’t think i ’ll ever experience that			1
’ catching practice : @entity24 does fielding practice on wednesday @entity108 hints at @entity32 return @entity4 plan to field the same side who ended their 10 - test winless run , meaning that @entity114 and @entity115 get another chance to support @entity18 and @entity117 with the wickets that eluded them in @entity16			1
‘ you always try to pick the best team but you have to also consider continuity , ’ said @entity24			0
‘ you do n’t want guys in the team always looking over their shoulder			0
the most successful sides are built on stability			0
’ there must have been a temptation for @entity4 to throw @entity32 , who has looked back to his old self in the @entity6 nets , into the fray but they are right not to jettison @entity114 on the back of one indifferent match			2
in good spirits : the @entity4 team looked to be enjoying themselves as they prepared for the @entity6 @entity114 was superb at @entity6 in the one - day victory over @entity139 earlier this season and seems to have suffered for being dropped after two tests against @entity139 in the clamour to re introduce @entity143			1
@entity4 have to be careful they do not return to the days of too much chopping and changing and both @entity114 and @entity115 , who bowled well without luck at the @entity146 , will now get the opportunity to settle in at the highest level			2
it seems certain that @entity117 will have the operation on his damaged right knee that has long looked necessary at the end of this series but he will not want to stand down just yet after returning , like @entity18 , to his best last week			2
both have mediocre records at @entity6 and will want to improve them now			0
the senior players had been the problem for @entity4 up until now but with @entity24 , @entity18 , @entity117 and @entity158 all leading the way in @entity16 the ‘ new era ’ suddenly has a much more positive feel about it			1
not least for the captain			0
ready to go : @entity158 takes part in catching practice at @entity6 ‘ it was great i scored runs last week and it was a big weight off my shoulders but it was only one game , ’ said @entity24			0
‘ i ’m thinking of my batting the same way we ’re approaching this match as a team			0
last week counts for nothing			0
’ it is the way it has to be for @entity4 until they consistently get back to winning ways but they will never have a better chance of defeating an @entity36 side who travel so badly and rarely undertake five - @entity27 series			1
@entity57 and his team looked sluggish in fielding practice yesterday , only livening up for the game of football they use as part of their warm - up that @entity57 in particular loves			0
‘ i ’m missing my soccer for this , ’ the ardent @entity193 fan was heard to say as he left his press conference yesterday			0
so @entity57 got to play football at @entity6 — except it was the wrong @entity6			0
it is how one of the few cricketers who earns @entity203 wages plays cricket here , as he faces up to a vindicated @entity18 , that will matter			2
and whether they exchange the odd word or two .			0

@entity18 is just 12 wickets short of sir @entity70 *'s* record
@entity18 faced no charges after his clash with @entity19
@entity4 and @entity36 drawing the @entity27 series 1 - 1 with two to play
