by @entity0 published : 10:28 est , 18 february 2013 updated : 12:26 est , 18 february 2013 @entity1 's will rake in hefty paychecks from a well - paying talent agency after stepping down as secretary of state			1
mrs @entity1 is now represented by the @entity5 which is known for getting famous politicians and newsmakers six - figure sums on the lecture circuit			1
the venture is her first formal decision about what she is going to do now that she is no longer working , though she is widely considered to be the @entity14 front runner should she decide to run for the presidency in 2016			1
next gig : former secretary of state @entity1 has signed up with a talent agency and will likely begin commanding six - figure fees on the lecture circuit her decision to attach her name to his particular @entity23 - based agency comes as little surprise since her husband former president @entity26 has long been represented by the group since he left office in 2000			1
the move was clearly a lucrative one , as he made $ 75.6million from 2001 to 2010 from speaking engagements , making $ 10.7million in just 2010 alone			0
president @entity26 is not the only big name with the agency , as his former vice president @entity35 has been booking $ 175,000 gigs through their connections , and former @entity23 mayor and @entity40 presidential candidate @entity39 regularly brings in $ 100,000 per event			1
former vice president @entity42 , former senators @entity43 and @entity44 , @entity46 campaign strategist @entity45 and former secretary general of the @entity49 @entity48 are all represented by the @entity5 as well			2
her exact asking price has not been reported , but @entity51 asserts that she ' will likely do some speeches for no fee for causes she champions , and expects to occasionally donate her fees for charitable purposes '			2
following suit : former vice presidents @entity42 ( left ) and @entity35 ( right ) are also represented by the @entity5 and are said to command $ 100,000 per speaking engagement @entity26 - an average of $ 181,000 , but in 2010 alone he earned $ 10.7million and a total of $ 75.6million between 2001 and 2010 @entity35 - $ 175,000 @entity63 - while working as a senator prior to his presidential bid in 2004 , @entity63 averaged $ 1,400 per speach @entity42 - $ 75,000 and first class travel for a three - person entourage @entity39 - $ 100,000 per event and he made $ 9.2million on a speaking tour from 2006 to 2007 @entity70 - $ 75,000 plus transportation @entity72 - $ 14,000 @entity73 - $ 200,000 per appearance along with the use of a private jet @entity77 earned $ 600,000 from @entity78 in @entity79 for an undisclosed number of events @entity82 - ' $ 20,000 to walk the red carpet while keeping mum about any future presidential plans , mrs @entity1 has said that she plans to write another book , this time about her work as secretary of state			1
publishing house @entity89 reportedly paid the former first lady an $ 8million advance on her first book , @entity93 , which she published in december 2000			0
with any and all positions that she decides to take , she will have to weigh the optics of if it would look appropriate for a presidential candidate			2
that said , another concern is shoring up a steady income , because it does n't come cheap to live like the @entity101 and six - figure speaking fees will certainly help			0
though there were early reports that they might buy a house in the @entity108 area of @entity109 , it appears now that they will hustle between their current residences in @entity111 and @entity112 , a quiet town in the suburbs of @entity23			0
she is also expected to either work with her husband 's @entity116 or start her own , though no decisions about that have been made at this point			0
the only thing that mrs @entity1 has publicly confirmed is that she plans to rest after a very taxing four years of traveling to 112 different countries			1
time together : aides think that @entity1 will spend some time working with her husband 's foundation as she finds her footing outside of the constraints of formal political office for the first time in decades as mrs @entity1 remains coy about her political prospects , her potential competitors are being very blatant in their fundraising attempts			0
on the @entity40 side , both @entity134 governor @entity133 and @entity136 senator @entity135 have raised significant sums for their campaign war chests in recent weeks			0
mr @entity133 attended a fundraiser in his honor at @entity145 founder @entity144 's @entity143 home , and mr @entity135 raised $ 100,000 by selling water bottles with his name on them , playing on his thirst - quenching gaffe during the @entity151 rebuttal .			0

stepped down from her *job* as secretary of state earlier this month
is widely considered the front runner for the @entity14 presidential *nomination* in 2016 but she has not decided if she will run
has always said that her first plans will be to sleep and go on *vacation* after a taxing four years as secretary of state
now she has signed up to earn *whopping* fees on the lecture circuit
