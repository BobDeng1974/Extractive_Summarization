by @entity0 published : 09:15 est , 11 october 2013 updated : 09:25 est , 11 october 2013 customers could end up paying more for phone contracts over the next year or so as a direct result of @entity4 increasing the amount it charges operators to rent radio spectrum			1
plans unveiled by the telecoms industry regulator reveal it intends to increase rental fees by more than 400 per cent in some cases , to bring the prices in line with the market value in other countries			0
mobile operators have slammed the plans as ' disappointing ' and ' excessive ' and such increases could see operators raising the price for phones , calls , data and monthly contracts to claw back some of this extra money			1
@entity4 's price increases will vary depending on how much radio spectrum each operator uses			1
@entity28 and @entity29 will each pay £ 83.1m a year - a 433 % rise , while @entity31 and @entity32 's are set to increase by 330 % to £ 107.1m and £ 35.7m respectively			1

@entity31 and @entity32 's rent is set to increase by 330 per cent			1
this will put @entity31 's new fee at £ 107.1 million , up from £ 24.9m			2
three 's will rise to £ 35.7 million , up from £ 24.9m			2
operators currently pay around £ 64.5 million in total for using the 900 megahertz and 1800 megahertz spectrum bands			2
the proposed changes are set to increase this total to around £ 309 million			0
earlier this year , the government raised just £ 2.34 billion during the @entity51 spectrum auction - it had hoped to raise £ 3.5 billion			2
the price rises are set to give the @entity53 an extra £ 245 million - a - year			1
the proposals come after @entity55 raised a less - than - expected £ 2.34 billion ( $ 3.7 billion ) during the @entity51 spectrum auction earlier this year - it had hoped to raise £ 3.5 billion			1
these price rises are set to give the @entity53 an extra £ 245 million - a - year			1

currently @entity28 , @entity63 's @entity29 , @entity31 and @entity64 's @entity32 ( that runs the three network ) pay around £ 64.5 million in total for using the 900 megahertz and 1800 megahertz spectrum bands			1
the proposed changes are set to increase this total to around £ 309 million			0
' @entity69 is a valuable and finite national resource , and charging for it can incentivise the optimal use of frequencies , ' @entity4 said in a statement			0
the @entity55 government asked @entity4 to recalculate the fees to reflect ' full market value ' and @entity4 said the new rules were expected to take effect next year after a consultation period that ends in december			2
operators had expected a price rise but @entity28 said it was disappointed by the scale of the increase			1
it said it was reviewing the details of @entity4 's proposals before responding to the regulator			0
this chart shows the results of @entity4 's @entity51 auction , in which parts of the spectrum were bid for by operators			2
earlier this year the government raised £ 2.34 billion during this auction , yet had a target of £ 3.5 billion			0
the government asked @entity4 to recalculate the spectrum fees to reflect ' full market value ' ' we are however disappointed that @entity4 is proposing a 430 percent increase in the fees we pay for our existing spectrum at a time when we are investing more than ever in vital national digital infrastructure , ' a spokesman said in a statement			2
' the regulator should be encouraging such private sector investment in infrastructure and new services like @entity51 , which will benefit consumers , businesses and the wider @entity55 economy for many years to come			0
' an @entity31 spokesman told @entity113 : ' the proposed increase in licence fees is excessive at a time when the industry needs to invest heavily in the roll out of @entity51			0
' there must be a balance between licence fees and the critical @entity123 investment consumers and businesses are demanding to drive growth and jobs for the @entity55 economy			0
' other operators are yet to respond			0
' our concern is that it will be mobile users who are left to foot the bill - and it is n’t clear if there will be any direct benefits to them , ' added @entity137 , telecoms expert at @entity138			0
' in fact , providers will no doubt be concerned that their investment in network infrastructure will be limited if they are shelling out more for licence fees			0
' no increases [ for consumers ] have been confirmed as yet - @entity4 are now consulting on the fees			0
it remains to be seen how much these costs will actually rise , and if the networks can fight back and keep a lid on these increases			0

@entity55 mobile operators rent radio spectrum on which they run their networks
the rises will depend on how much spectrum each operator currently uses

@entity31 and @entity32 's rent to increase by 330 % to £ 107m and £ 35.7m respectively
