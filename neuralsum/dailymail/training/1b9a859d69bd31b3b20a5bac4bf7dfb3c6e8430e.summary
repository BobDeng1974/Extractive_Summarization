@entity0 was already celebrating as he broke the tape to become the first @entity3 winner of the @entity4 for almost 30 years			1
he might have even dipped under the 60min mark were it not for a ' mobot ' at the finish			1
training partner @entity8 was only a heartbeat behind , but @entity11 , who had failed to win any of his past three road races , seemed unaware and both recorded one hour dead			1
the pair , who share a management company , admitted working together during the race but denied @entity8 had let his friend win			1
winner : @entity0 wins the @entity4 with his teammate @entity8 just behind the two ran side by side for most of the 13.1 miles from @entity23 to @entity24 , with the @entity25 urging @entity11 on			1
as they embarked on the final mile @entity8 encouraged his training partner			1
' he was saying , ' @entity28 ' , ' said @entity11			2
' we had a chat before the race and i said , ' what we should do is try and go off , leave everybody else and work together to see what we can do '			2
' @entity8 is a great athlete and in great shape			1
there were a couple of times i was struggling but i managed to get back to him			2
' i knew if it came down to the finish i could use my sprint finish but today he actually did test me and i believe he could have run a lot faster if he had people to go with			2
if it was n't for how high he thinks of me , he could have really had a go at one point			2
' this was another historic victory for @entity11 after a punishing but ultimately victorious year			2
road racing , he has admitted , has been more testing than anticipated			0
@entity51 : @entity11 puts the trophy on top of his head as he recovers from his deflation from the @entity57 he finished a deflated eighth in the @entity57			0
he has also collapsed twice this year , setbacks he admitted gave rise to mental doubts			0
' it 's been a tough year , ' he said , ' but to turn it around is incredible			0
i 've learned you can push your body and do more			0
' the 31 - year - old was narrowly beaten in a sprint finish on his @entity4 debut last year but said he learned from that defeat			1
he wore a woollen hat in 2013 but there was no need for headgear this time with barely a cloud in the sky over @entity77			0
the weather was kind and so were the race organisers			0
instead of @entity82 's @entity81 , who got the better of him last time , there was his less prolific brother @entity83 while @entity57 winner @entity84 of @entity85 was below his best			2
the biggest threat was @entity8 who opened a small gap on several occasions but did not extend his lead , even around the 10 - mile mark when @entity11 appeared to be struggling			1
success : @entity11 is @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95 on the track and wants to continue this on the road there were suggestions that @entity8 did not press his advantage			1
' my aim was not to give him too much gap and just work , ' said @entity11 , who denied @entity8 was slowing to allow him to catch up			1
@entity8 insisted he gave maximum effort			1
' i was slowing because i was tired but the last 400 metres was tough for me , ' he said			0
' that 's why @entity0 won			1
i 'm happy with second			0
' on an historic day for the event , which celebrated an incredible one millionth finisher , @entity11 broke his own half - marathon national record and became the first @entity3 winner since 1985			1
the name of @entity116 , who won when @entity11 was two - years - old , was unknown to yesterday 's victor and the only records music fan @entity116 is interested in now are those he sells from his stall in @entity124 town centre			2
' we have n't had a @entity3 winner in 29 years so it 's great to change that , ' said @entity11			1
' i did n't know we were so close to going under 60 minutes			0
the aim was to win the race rather than run a fast time so it 's great we did both			0
' the reigning @entity93 , world and @entity135 champion over 5,000m and 10,000m now has his sights on next year 's @entity138 world championships			0
but first there is a holiday on sir @entity142 's @entity141			0
' it will be nice to have a rest , ' said @entity11			0
in the women 's race , @entity25 @entity145 won in 1:05.39 , breaking @entity149 's course record set in 2003			0
@entity3 's @entity150 was second with a personal best of 1:08.13			1
