a photograph by a colleague allegedly shows @entity5 , a performance manager with @entity6 ( @entity6 ) , having a nap during a night shift			1
it was leaked by a whistleblower who claimed that when it was taken mrs @entity5 was supposed to be monitoring 999 calls on her computer			1

bosses at @entity6 confirmed they had launched an inquiry into the allegations			2
the whistleblower told a local newspaper that mrs @entity5 was supposed to be looking at emergency jobs on her screen when her eyes were shut			2
mr @entity21 should have been at his desk waiting to dispatch ambulances to respond to the 999 calls			2
a spokesman for @entity6 admitted a performance manager ’s job is to monitor call activity , ensuring all 999 calls are answered and categorised , but dispatchers and call handlers do not always sit at their desks throughout their shifts			0

red calls – those requiring help for seriously ill patients – were up 12.1 per cent in july compared with the previous year			0
