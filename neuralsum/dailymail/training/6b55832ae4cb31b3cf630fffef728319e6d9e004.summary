@entity1 residents fear voodoo rituals are to blame for piles of headless cockerels and pigeons that are being found on the city 's streets			1
piles of birds , intact save for their heads , have been left in several locations in the past few weeks , but every time they are cleared away , more bodies appear			2
@entity14 priest @entity13 has confirmed that the sightings could be linked to magic rituals , saying someone could be trying to use voodoo to appease a spirit			2
street cleaner @entity30 started to see the headless chickens a few weeks back , and told @entity32 he has continued to see carcasses as he makes his rounds			1
' the first time i saw it , it was a large rooster			0
everything else is there , feet , feathers			0
it â€™s just decapitated , ' he said			0
' i actually think it must be voodoo			0
' @entity13 , a priest for the @entity14 @entity46 religion which has similarities to @entity48 , said the placing of the birds would suggest it is part of a ritual			1
' they might be wiping themselves with the bird , letting the blood and then having to discard the body , ' @entity13 said			0
he added that those who follow religions like @entity46 often sacrifice birds and goats for protection or cleansing rituals			1
the carcasses then have to be left in a place the ' deity is calling out for ' he added			0
voodoo : @entity13 , a priest of the @entity14 @entity46 religion , says the birds may be part of a cleansing ritual distrubing : the headless pigeons and other birds has upset store owners , who say they are a health risk with voodoo , most birds or animals used for sacrifice are usually eaten afterwards in communal meals , and their blood is splashed over altars			1
but for business owners in @entity1 , having to constantly call animal control to have the dead birds removed has become a sickening chore			1
the stench of rotting chicken lingers in the alleys behind their businesses , and the store owners are concerned about possible health risks .			2

piles of dead birds have been *spotted* in alleys across the city
headless chickens may be cleansing ritual , @entity46 priest says
