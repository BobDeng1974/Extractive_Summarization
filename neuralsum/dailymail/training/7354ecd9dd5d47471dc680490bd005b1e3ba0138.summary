by @entity0 humans have been decorating graves with flowers for almost 14,000 years , say archeologists			1
the first evidence the tradition of floral tributes has been dug up in @entity8 where sage , mint and other plants were used in ceremonial burials			1
in modern times the tradition is used as a sign of respect or remembrance , but it is believed to have started thousands of years ago to disguise the stench of the rotting corpse			1
it was also hoped the scent of the plants would stop animals being attracted to the grave to dig up the body			0
the earliest evidence of humans burying their dead with flowers , 13,700 years ago , was discovered in the same location at @entity32 last summer			1
researchers found sage , mint ( pictured ) and other plants buried with the skeletons			2
the latest findings suggest this ritual may have been more complex than first thought the ancient @entity40 often laid out the ground of the tomb as a garden so the spirit could enjoy itself as it wandered			2
the latest discovery was unearthed at the bottom of 13,700 to 11,700 year - old graves at a scenic prehistoric burial spot known as @entity49 overlooking the @entity51 coast			1
professor @entity52 and his team used radiocarbon dating on the lining of tombs containing 29 skeletons , of children and adults , with four containing large plant impressions identified as the stems of sage , mint and figwort			0
professor @entity52 , an archaelogist at @entity65 in @entity8 , said : ' flowering plants possess mechanisms that stimulate positive emotional and social responses in humans			1
' it 's difficult to establish when people started to use flowers in public and ceremonial events because of the scarcity of relevant evidence in the archaeological record			1
' we report on uniquely preserved 13,700 - 11,700 - year - old grave linings made of flowers suggesting such use began much earlier than previously thought			1
' part of plants cells called phytoliths from grasses , leaves , reeds and sedges were identified all over the cave and on its terrace			0

prof @entity52 believes that grave preparation was a sophisticated planned process , embedded with social and spiritual meanings reflecting a complex pre-agricultural society the burial pits also had crafted and natural stone objects - perhaps as markers or symbols - as well as a prevalence of flints and butchered animal bones suggesting celebratory feasts			1
prof @entity52 said : ' some of the plant species attest to spring burials with a strong emphasis on colourful and aromatic flowers			0
' @entity112 floor chiseling to accommodate the desired grave location and depth is also evident at the site			0
' thus , grave preparation was a sophisticated planned process , embedded with social and spiritual meanings reflecting a complex pre-agricultural society undergoing profound changes at the end ofthe @entity120			0
' the only earlier evidence of flower burials comes from pollen grains in a neanderthal 's grave in @entity126 but these could have been left by a rodent with a habit of storing seeds and flower heads			2
the largest number of preserved plant impressions was in the double burial of a 12 to 15 year - old adolescent and an individual over 30			2
the two were lying on their backs parallel to each other with their elbows juxtaposed , according to the research published in @entity142			0
the ancient burial pit dating to nearly 14,000 years ago contained impressions from stems and flowers of aromatic plants such as sage ( left ) and mint ( right ) prof @entity52 said : ' @entity149 finds from @entity49 indicate 13,700 to 11,700 years ago the @entity150 lined graves with a soft mud veneer and then placed a thick cover of fresh flowering plants - thereby providing colour and aromatic fragrance			1
' experimental studies have demonstrated flowers ' significant role as external sources of emotional stimuli with measurable positive impacts on human social function			0
' flowers can be used to express sympathy , pride and joy			0
they also are used to express religious feelings ; in some religions flowers are considered the direct route for spiritual communication			0
' these relationships may benefit fitness in both humans and flowers and have been linked to the domestication of certain species of flowering plants more than 5,000 years ago			2
' the use of flowers much earlier in social events such as funerals could have served to enhance group identity and solidarity			2
prof @entity52 said : ' the development of group - specific burials and related practices likely reduced social tensions and improved group cohesion in a period of fluctuating environmental conditions , increasing population density and growing social conflicts			0
' the emergence of cemeteries such as those at @entity198 and @entity112 also may represent new and complex social organisations which could have included the establishment or strengthening of special interest groups , inheritance of corporate property , territorial ownerships and aspects of social organisation			0

the first evidence of floral tributes on graves has been found in graves almost 14,000 years old at a scenic prehistoric burial site in @entity8
experts say the flowers could have been used to disguise the stench of rotting corpses - or prevent rats from digging up bodies
the discovery suggests that the use of of flowers to decorate graves goes back much earlier than previously thought
