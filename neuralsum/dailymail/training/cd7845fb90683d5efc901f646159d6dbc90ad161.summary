by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 22:20 est , 6 february 2014 @entity3 : 13:18 est , 7 february 2014 @entity5 authorities say four human heads have been found in a town in @entity8 , a western state where rural vigilantes sprang up a year ago to try to drive out a cult - like drug cartel called the @entity12 , which is run by a crystal meth - selling former school teacher similar to the @entity16 character in the hit television series @entity19			1
a federal official says police investigators also found a threatening note along with the human remains in @entity24 but would n't reveal its content			0
the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not allowed to talk to the press			0
he said the remains found thursday belong to four men between 22 and 55 years of age			0
@entity5 has sent thousands of federal forces to @entity8 following shootouts between vigilantes and the @entity12 cartel			1
the @entity12 is one of the most powerful - and ruthless - drug cartels in @entity5 and currently engaged in a bloody war with several vigilante groups that are trying to rid @entity8 of blood - thirsty cartel			1
the cartel was started by @entity39 in 2011			2
@entity39 , a former teacher , is better know throughout the state as ' @entity60 , ' or ' the teacher			2
' in recent interviews given from his hideout somewhere in @entity64 , @entity39 has described the cartel as a sort of necessary evil , claiming that if the @entity69 were n't around to protect citizens , another cartel would soon take over and things could potentially be worse			2
' @entity72 ' : @entity73 , second - in - command of the @entity12 , was arrested by @entity5 authorities in january in february of 2013 , vigilante groups started rising up against the @entity12 's reign of terror and extortion after police and troops failed to stop the abuses			1
last month , the @entity5 government essentially legalized the vigilante movement in @entity8 by reaching an agreement with vigilante leaders to incorporate the armed civilian groups into old and largely forgotten quasi-military units called the @entity88			1
vigilante groups estimate their numbers at 20,000 men under arms			1
' the self - defense forces will become institutionalized , when they are integrated into the @entity88 , ' the @entity93 said in a statement			2
police and soldiers already largely tolerate , and in some cases even work with , the vigilantes , many of whom are armed with assault rifles that civilians are not allowed to carry			0
vigilante leaders will have to submit a list of their members to the @entity107 , and the army will apparently oversee the groups , which the government said ' will be temporary			1
' they will be allowed to keep their weapons as long as they register them with the army			0
the military will give the groups ' all the means necessary for communications , operations and movement , ' according to the agreement			2
vigilantes : vigilante groups are fighting the @entity12 at every turn , hoping to run the cartel out of @entity8 @entity125 , a leader of the self - defense force in the town of @entity128 , said leaders had accepted the government proposal			1
but the nuts - and - bolts ' are still not well defined , ' he added			0
' we wo n't start working on the mechanisms until tomorrow			0
' vigilante leader @entity134 said the agreement also allows those who qualify to join local police forces			0
' the majority of us want to get into the police ... i never imagined myself dressed as a policeman , but the situation is driving me to put on a uniform			0
' @entity144 has been bruised by experiences with quasi-military forces , with such tolerated or legally recognized groups being blamed for rights abuses in @entity149 and @entity150 in the past			0
while the cartel may be on its way out , ' there should n't be abuses by those who come after , there should n't be what we would call a witch hunt ; there should be reconciliation , ' said the rev. @entity163 , part of a team of priests in the @entity168 diocese of @entity169 who have publicly denounced abuses by the @entity12			1
before dawn on monday , soldiers and police arrested one of the cartel 's top leaders , @entity177 , alias ' @entity72 , ' or @entity72			0
@entity180 secretary @entity179 said the feared drug lord was arrested without a shot being fired			0
he said federal forces found @entity184 in @entity185 , the capital of @entity8 , ' hiding in a closet ' and accompanied only by 16 - year - old boy			1
the vigilante groups were recently given the blessing of the @entity5 government			1
here , they detain several alleged cartel members the 58 - year - old @entity184 had a 30 - million peso ( $ 2.25 million ) reward on his head from the @entity5 government for drug , organized crime and money - laundering charges			1
he was considered one of the country 's three dozen most - wanted drug lords in the late 2000s			0
the @entity12 ruled many parts of @entity8 with an iron fist , demanding extortion payments from businesses , farmers and workers , but the self - defense groups have gained ground against the cartel in recent months			1
federal police and army troops were dispatched to bring peace to the troubled region , but the vigilantes have demanded the arrest of the cartel 's major leaders before they lay down their guns			0
@entity223 , an activist in the vigilante movement from the town of @entity226 , which was the first to rise up against the @entity12 , said the arrest ' means a lot ' to the vigilantes , but added that they wo n't rest until they see all the top bosses arrested			1
@entity223 voiced a common belief that the man who founded the cartel under the name @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , ' is still alive , despite the government 's statement in 2010 that he had been killed in a shootout with federal forces			2
' he 's still alive ; there 's proof he 's still alive , ' @entity223 said			0
@entity184 got his nickname , ' @entity72 , ' because he is believed to be the uncle of another top @entity12 leader , @entity248			2
@entity184 joined @entity249 and @entity39 in forming the @entity12 after the purported death of @entity238 .			2

the @entity12 currently is doing battle with vigilante groups in the western state of @entity8
@entity12 is led by a former teacher turned meth - dealing cartel kingpin like @entity16 in the television show @entity19
the @entity5 government recently agreed to *cooperate* with the vigilante groups in the fight against the cartel
