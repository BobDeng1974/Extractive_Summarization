they and around 20 others were left completely terrified after the overcrowded hot air balloon ran out of gas , narrowly missed a high - rise hotel before plunging into the @entity6			1
footage of the incident clearly shows it is the same vessel as the one that took the lives of three britons and 16 other foreign tourists yesterday			2
it was a miracle that we were n't killed			1
it really was that close , ' mrs @entity37 said			1
her husband @entity39 added : ' you get caught up in the holiday picture - postcard type of sell they have for you but we were n't aware of the volume of people that went in a basket			2
' the same balloon they rode in in 2011 exploded in a fireball 1,000ft above the @entity49 yesterday			1
@entity50 , 40 , and @entity51 were among 19 tourists killed during an early morning flight over the ancient ruins of @entity55 when their balloon caught fire and exploded after it hit a power line			1
@entity2 resident @entity59 , 34 , the girlfriend of mr @entity50 , also died in the blaze which killed 19 tourists			2

retired policeman @entity81 , 67 , from @entity82 , had to spend four months in hospital with 26 broken bones , and could not hide her distress that another incident had happened so soon afterwards			0
following the 2009 crash , early morning hot air balloon flights over the @entity88 on the @entity89 of the @entity6 were suspended for six months while safety measures were tightened up			2
during the break , all 42 pilots from the eight companies who operate flights had extra training , but it has not stopped another disaster			0
' it brought back all the mayhem and horrific events of that day , ' mrs @entity81 said			2
' these balloons are just too unstable			0
there is not enough training of staff			0
there were about 22 or 23 in my balloon when it crashed and maybe there was too many then , and too many in today 's accident , ' she said			2
beautiful : hot air balloon trips over the @entity88 is incredibly popular but there are plenty of horror stories from @entity2 tourists about them only last month londoner @entity119 was on a balloon ride in @entity55 that left him ' scared ' after the pilot seemed slapdash with equipment befoe they crashed into a tree			1
' they go up to 800 or 1,000 feet , then bring the balloon down and across the temples at a low height , ' he told the @entity129			0
@entity130 , from @entity131 , said yesterday 's tragedy brought back memories of a hot air balloon flight he took over the @entity88 a few years ago			0
mr @entity130 said the balloon he was in caught fire as its operator tried to avoid power lines			0
he told @entity140 @entity139 that when he heard about the accident in @entity55 , ' i thought " there but for the grace of @entity145 , that could have happened to us "			1
' heartbreak : the green and yellow balloon ( far left ) , which had crashed into the @entity6 two years ago , pictured yesterday just 40 minutes before it exploded tragic : medical workers in @entity150 transfer bodies of victims of the hot air balloon crash off a plane from @entity55 loss of life : three @entity2 died when the balloon dropped from the sky at 1,000 ft over @entity157 during a dawn flight speaking on the @entity161 programme , he said : ' we went to @entity55 and we had an early - morning flight			1
the balloon flight should have taken us over the @entity88 but , due to the wind direction , it took us in another direction			0
' we started to head towards some power lines and whether the operator did n't see them or not we do n't know , but what happened was he started frantically to get the balloon above the power lines , and in doing so he set the balloon on fire			1
' he added : ' i was looking down at the time , but suddenly my neck felt rather warm , and i said to the gentleman next to me and he looked up and said ' no wonder - the balloon is on fire '			0
' suddenly all this hot debris came falling down on us and we dropped down into the basket and he put his coat over us and we just sat down right in the bottom of the basket			0
' in a matter of minutes really , i ca n't say how long it took , the balloon started to come down very fast and all i can remember is we had this heavy thud on the ground and we landed in this field			1
' when we stopped no - one spoke			0
everyone was shook up and in shock			0
' mr @entity130 said he was not injured but his wife was ' very badly bruised ' and another man in the balloon hurt his ankle , leaving him struggling to walk , he recalled : ' there was quite a lot of people badly bruised , there was no real bad injuries , hospital injuries , but there was a lot of people shocked and badly bruised			0
