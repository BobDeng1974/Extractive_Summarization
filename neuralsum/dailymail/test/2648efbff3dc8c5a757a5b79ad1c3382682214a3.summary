you 'd think that being a chef , i 'd want to escape the toils of the kitchen while on holiday - but the opposite is true			1
i jump at the chance to experience new flavours and gather fresh inspiration			1
and where better to tickle your tastebuds than in glorious @entity12 ? the island is known for its zesty spices and self - sufficiency - the only food it imports is milk			1
heading west : @entity19 spent a week on @entity12 , where fresh foodstuffs like cocoa fruit are easily available meat and fish are plentiful and , because the soil is very fertile , the vegetables , fruit and salads are the glossiest you 'll ever see			1
@entity12 's seasons are similar to our own , which means cauliflower , broccoli and pumpkins in spring			1
exotic fruit - mangoes , star fruit , passion fruit , melon and skin - up , which is like a lychee — are the stars of the summer			0
@entity42 heralds guavas , sweetsop ( sugar apples ) and soursop ( similar to pawpaw ) , and then there is the temptingly named mammee apple , which is a @entity49 version of a peach			1
sumptuous sands : @entity12 is home to splendid beaches - such as the glorious arc of @entity54 i am staying in the southwest of the island at @entity58 on @entity59 , near the charming town of @entity61			1
it offers well - equipped self - catering villas , each with its own terrace and wonderful views of the bay			0
you can cook your own supper , but the bubbling restaurant scene is difficult to resist			0
i especially liked the @entity73 at @entity58 , where they serve fabulously strong cocktails made with local rum at all hours of the day and night			1
people come across from nearby islands to enjoy the weekly bonfire on the beach , at which local musicians play			1
this is the @entity49 at its best			1
just beware of those generous drinks measures			0
the restaurant @entity86 ( which is text speakfor ' you only live once ' ) specialises in sushi and @entity91 cuisine			0
i order plums , mangoes , cherries and avocados , all picked that day			0
the fish is as fresh as can be - so the tuna tartare , its signature dish , almost leaps off the plate			2
come dine with me : @entity12 is an island awash with fresh produce and intriguing local recipes the next day , i watch a fish cookery demonstration at @entity58 : a traditional dish of kingfish marinated in coconut , ginger , lime , spices , peppers and chives , wrapped in banana leaves and cooked over a wood fire , and served with delicious breadfruit chips			1
if you want to mingle with @entity117 , there is nowhere better than a rambunctious food market			0
@entity61 's market brims with local spices and everything else that is grown on the island			1
in a 17th - century working plantation - a colonial house and estate - you can witness the crops of fruit , exotic flowers and spices in their regimented glory			0
here , i learn to cook the @entity132 national dish , oil down			0
this is a hearty , one - pot meal with salted meat , chicken , breadfruit , callaloo - which is like spinach - and dumplings			0
the whole lot is stewed in coconut milk			0
delicious ! the food odyssey continues in the evening when i visit @entity146 's @entity145 restaurant , overlooking the harbour			2
my favourite place to eat on the beach is @entity150 , on its own strip of sand from which you can swim in a bath - temperature sea			2
a place to cool your heels : @entity19 stayed at @entity12 's elegant @entity58 resort no tour of the island would be complete without a visit to the @entity162 - the last one in the @entity49 to make the drink from cane sugar , as they did in the 18th century			1
@entity166 is not to my taste , but it 's interesting to see the process behind it			2
belmont in the @entity172 area is more to my liking			0
it 's a fully functioning plantation and organic farm			2
we taste goat 's cheese and salt fish fritters , a popular local dish			1
even the governor grows her own vegetables			0
her excellency @entity183 is the first woman governor on the island			2
she received an obe from the @entity186 for the food business started by her mother			0
her extensive gardens are full of exotic vegetables , fruit and spices — a dream to any aspiring cook			2
even the paths are made of crushed nutmeg shells			0
a fitting tribute to this fragrant and friendly island			2
@entity199 ( 0844 493 0787 , www.ba.com ) flies to @entity12 from £ 562 return			1
a one - bedroom suite at the @entity58 hotel resort & beach club ( 001 473 439 4400 , www.mountcinnamongrenadahotel.com ) starts from £ 265 b&b per night .			0

@entity12 is known as the ' @entity206 ' , and is full of foodie flavours
