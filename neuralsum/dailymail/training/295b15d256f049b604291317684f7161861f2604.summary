the opening day of the @entity1 had more on offer than just golf			1
it had cigar - smoking basketball legends , deers almost delaying play , a certain @entity9 golfer leaving his putter somewhere he should n't ... but what else did you miss ? here , @entity13 keep you up to date with all that is going on at @entity14			2
@entity15 's quiet day an indicator of the excitement around the first tee in the morning was the way @entity20 mingled among the public , going virtually unrecognised			2
this despite him sporting his trademark no 23 on the green armband he wears for his @entity26 tv work			0
@entity20 was among those watching the action between @entity9 and @entity26 on friday at the @entity1 @entity20 may not have been impressed by what he witnessed by his countrymen in the @entity1 so far @entity31 @entity33 ’s poor morning showing will fuel criticism of @entity36 ’s hunch to select him as a captain ’s pick			1
@entity36 justified the decision by saying @entity40 plays well at this time of year , ‘ after the @entity41 ’ , which came last monday			0
@entity33 ( pictured ) was picked by @entity36 for @entity26 but he put on a poor performance on friday passing the buck a deer almost stopped play before the second singles match featuring @entity47 and @entity48 , scampering up the fairway before disappearing into the woods			1
wildlife abounds in this area of @entity53 , including the protected black grouse			0
a deer almost stopped play as @entity47 and @entity48 got going in the @entity1 on friday @entity57 draws the crowds the 45,000 attendance shows the allure of the @entity1			1
@entity62 crowds have not been so enthusiastic for @entity63 of late			0
crowds were well down at @entity64 last year , drawing only 142,000 people overall , while @entity66 five years ago drew a relatively paltry aggregate of 115,000			0
the 45,000 attendance shows the allure of the @entity1 after interest fell in certain tournaments previously @entity70 @entity72 @entity71 got caught short after answering a call of nature between the 11th and 12th hole			2
he went into the neighbouring convenience carrying his putter and then left it in there — luckily accompanying vice-captain @entity80 was on hand to go back and retrieve the vital piece of equipment			0
@entity72 @entity71 got caught short after answering a call of nature between the 11th and 12th hole @entity87 's turning heads at 6ft 3in and wearing a red beret , former basketball player @entity89 , married to @entity90 , was the most recognisable of the @entity26 wives			1
the other halves of @entity90 ’s opponents , @entity92 and @entity93 , were notable mainly for @entity92 providing a caring supportive arm as pregnant @entity93 made the steep climbs around @entity14			0
@entity99 's wife , @entity89 ( right ) , and @entity33 's wife , @entity100 , walk together during the @entity1			1

@entity20 was in attendance at the @entity1 on friday
a deer almost *disrupted* play before it ran back into the woods
at 6ft 3in and wearing a red beret , former basketball player @entity89 , married to @entity90 , was the most recognisable of the @entity26 wives
