if so , for one @entity8 pony grazing 300ft above @entity9 in @entity10 , it was a munch too far			1
after slithering 230ft , she was left stranded on a ledge for four days before a 40 - strong team of professionals saved her from a lingering death			0
the alarm was raised by @entity18 inspector @entity17 after local residents reported the pony ’s plight			1
what a donkey ! somehow , the pony managed to tumble over a 300ft cliff at @entity9 , @entity25 this lasso 's never going to work : the @entity8 pony slithered down 230ft before coming to a stop on a ledge easy does it : amazing , she survived and remained stuck there for four days until a fireman was lowered on ropes to help her com back here ! the fireman coaxed her safely on to the beach and then had to carefully usher her across the sand towards fellow rescuers then in came coastguards , firemen specialising in mineshaft rescues , the @entity18 ’s own rescue team , a crew from @entity45 - based @entity44 and a vet armed with a tranquilliser dart powerful enough to knock out a rhino			1
@entity53 manager @entity52 , who led the operation , said : ‘ the pony was none the worse afterwards although she quickly downed a bucket of water			2
‘ the real mystery is how on earth she managed to get down so far and survive			0
‘ it was as if she had been plucked off the clifftop and placed there			0
’ saving private pony : as the beach was accessible only by sea , a crew from @entity45 - based @entity44 , who were on a routine training exercise , stepped in to help all aboard ! the rescue operation ferried in vet @entity74 who fired a tranquiliser dart at the animal			1
the sedated pony was strapped to a raft , which was floated out to a landing craft and dragged aboard steady ass she goes : mission accomplished , the landing craft - accompanied by a @entity44 sail boat - carefully sets sail from the beach			1
a @entity44 spokesman commended rescuers ' deftness and flexibility '			0
not surprisingly , he admitted ' there is no standard procedure for this activity '			0
hitting the hay : back on dry land , the pony sleeps off the effects of the tranquiliser			2
@entity18 inspector @entity17 says she has been named @entity100 in honour of the @entity44 stable condition : back on her hooves and feeling her old self again , the mare is visited by mr @entity17			1
' now all i 've got do is find her owner , ' he said			0
' if no one comes forward , i might adopt her myself			0
