by @entity0 published : 00:22 est , 15 july 2013 updated : 00:25 est , 15 july 2013 couple : @entity2 in 1999 with his long - term partner @entity3 , 24 years his junior he had an unparalleled career in broadcasting , in which he exquisitely exposed the foibles of the rich , the famous and the infamous , but @entity2 guarded his own personal life with an obsessive dedication			1
assisted by his long - term partner @entity3 , 24 years his junior , the charismatic @entity2 hid himself away for the last two years of his life at his mansion in @entity13 , while his health deteriorated , declining inducements to journey to @entity17 or indulge his passion for travel			1
and now it transpires that the globe - trotting documentary - maker took a secret to his grave — his real age			1
the much - parodied tv star knocked off four years , making him 87 , as is recorded in his @entity27 entry and given by the @entity29 in the announcement of his death last week			1
but , in fact , @entity2 died of pneumonia aged 91			1
some might consider the debonair gent a tad mischievous to tell a white lie about how old he was , not least because one of his best - known tv exposés was his despatch decades ago about how the @entity43 set were resorting to plastic surgery — in order to look younger			1
@entity2 , i can reveal , was born on august 2 , 1921 , in @entity46 , where his father was a serving @entity48 officer			1
but when the @entity50 presenter was first asked by @entity27 for his personal details , he gave his birthdate as august 2 , 1925			1
of course , @entity2 is not the first celebrity to disguise their age			1
@entity56 omits her 1933 birth year in @entity27 after 2009 ( she turned 80 this may )			1
says a colleague : ‘ i once saw @entity2 ’s birth certificate and can confirm he was 91			1
’ disguising his age : @entity2 ( pictured with @entity3 in this undated photograph ) gave his birthdate as august 2 , 1925 when first asked by @entity27 for his personal details as an apparent ladies ’ man , @entity2 was happy to portray himself as younger than he really was			1
when asked which six objects he would take with him to a desert island , he replied : ‘ two blondes , two brunettes and two redheads			1
’ in reality , however , he spent the last 44 years of his life devoted to @entity3 , whom he met in 1969			1
they moved to @entity13 in 1972 and she took the photographs for his travel books and produced his later documentaries			1
when sir @entity76 arrived at the @entity77 to catch a glimpse of @entity79 creaking around the stage , he found his entrance blocked by a clipboard jobsworth			1
having failed to recognise the famous beardy , he told theatre director @entity76 that he would not be allowed in			2
‘ there was quite a kerfuffle until someone realised who he was , ’ says a fellow music lover			2
can you imagine sir @entity76 ’s erstwhile consort , fiesty @entity94 firecracker @entity92 , putting up with such insolence ? @entity96 turns the petrolheads striking sight : @entity96 ( @entity100 ) @entity99 , 29 , was sporting a dramatically half - shaved head among the beautiful classic motor cars which pitched up for the annual @entity104 yesterday , there was an even more striking sight on the lawn of lord march ’s @entity108 estate in @entity110			2
his elder daughter , @entity96 ( @entity100 ) @entity99 , 29 , who is based in @entity112 where she is studying psychology , had returned home sporting a dramatically half - shaved head			2
as she mingled with guests including sir @entity117 and sir @entity118 at the @entity120 champagne reception , she tells me : ‘ the new hair was just a crazy day			2
i got bored of my long hair and one of my friends did it for me and it was just for fun			2
‘ it is a ridiculous hairstyle , but i like it			2
i like just having a bit of a play and not taking things too seriously			2
’ however , her motoring - loving father is not so enthusiastic			2
@entity96 admits : ‘ i ’m not sure @entity134 likes it			2
‘ he ’s very sweet and is always very kind about whatever hairstyle i come home with — but i think he prefers me looking more feminine			2
’ of her new life across the pond , she adds : ‘ i have an @entity141 boyfriend called @entity142			1
‘ i have n’t been out with many englishmen because i have been travelling and have n’t lived in @entity144 since i was 23			0
i am a free spirit			0

nineteen months after he was caught stealing wine , onions and coleslaw from his local @entity156 , the chef says that even after having counselling here and attending the ‘ very expensive ’ @entity161 in @entity160 , he still does n’t know why he did it			0
psychiatrists , he says , tried to make a connection between his five instances of theft and his being abused as a child — but he is n’t convinced			0
‘ i did wrong and i do n’t know why i did it , ’ says @entity146			0
‘ it was a mini breakdown , there ’s no doubt about that			0
’ @entity146 , 62 , compares his behaviour with the time @entity175 got caught with @entity43 prostitute @entity176			0
‘ he can get any woman in the world that he wants			0
and what does he do ? he wants to be caught			0
’ it ’s not unusual when a son declines to follow in father ’s footsteps for @entity134 to be a bit disappointed			0
but not in the case of former @entity187 world champion @entity186 , who has welcomed his 22 - year - old son @entity188 ’s decision to give up motor - racing after seven years — and become a rock drummer in a band			1
‘ i hate this idea that children are horses and they have to be bred into a particular thing , ’ @entity186 tells me			0
‘ @entity188 was born into a big motor - racing family and i think there was always going to be a question over whether it was his calling			1
‘ he felt it was something he was expected to do , but he has to love what he does			0
that ’s the important thing			0
’ however , @entity186 adds : ‘ it ’s the end of a phase , really , for us as far as @entity211 racing dynasty goes			0
’ @entity213 ’s crimper to wash and go married : @entity214 is whisking his bride of six months , glamour model @entity216 , to @entity217 who will tend the unkempt locks of sir @entity213 while his crimper @entity214 is in @entity141 ? @entity214 is whisking his bride of six months , glamour model @entity216 , to @entity217 because she wants to re-invent herself as a proper actress			0
‘ @entity216 has been accepted on a method acting course in @entity226 and i ’ve got important business in @entity141 , ’ asserts @entity214 grandly at a bash at @entity224 ’s @entity223			0
