@entity0 , chief executive of the trust which runs the school refused to comment but an online message said the decision was for ' safety ' reasons when snow began to fall gently around their primary school , pupils were naturally excited			1
but their joy quickly melted away when their teachers banned them from going near it – or even looking at it through the window			2
the youngsters were kept inside after they were ‘ marshalled ’ into the building at the start of the day			2
and a teacher even closed the blinds to stop a class of eight and nine - year - olds from being ‘ distracted ’ by watching it through the window			1
the school – where a vicar caused uproar before @entity28 by telling pupils that @entity30 does n’t exist – claimed it had acted because of health and safety concerns as the ground had become icy			1
but outraged parents accused staff at @entity37 , near @entity38 in @entity39 , of being killjoys after just 1cm of snow fell and said that they had missed an opportunity to teach the enthusiastic children about snow			1
mother - of - six @entity45 , 43 , whose daughter @entity46 , eight , is a pupil at the school , said : ‘ when they told me they ’d shut the blinds i could n’t believe it			1
they ’re only little and they only stay children for a short time			2
‘ they could have turned the snow into a science lesson instead of banning them from seeing it			0
‘ by the time they came out of school it was all gone			0
i do n’t want it to end up with my children only knowing about snow from @entity28 cards			1
’ @entity64 , 30 , who has an eight - year - old son at the academy , said : ‘ stopping them from seeing it fall is like a slap in the face for little children			1
’ another mother , who asked not to be named but whose nine - year - old daughter was in the classroom when the blinds were shut , said : ‘ it only snowed for about 40 minutes but the teacher put the blinds down so they could n’t see it			1
‘ it was so dark they had to put the lights on			0
they were stuck in all day as they were n’t allowed to play in the snow – and there was only about 1cm			0
hitting the headlines : @entity88 , in @entity39 , has previously been in the news after a visiting reverend told children that @entity30 is n't real ‘ these are eight - year - olds			1
it ’s not like they ’re doing a-levels			0
i just thought it ’s a bit pathetic			0
other local schools were doing snowman - building competitions			0
’ she added : ‘ they said there were health and safety reasons because it was icy but it was n’t			1
‘ then they said there were education reasons because the kids were doing a test but none of them remember taking a test			0
’ she said there had been another light smattering of snow a few days earlier , during which one child was told off for ‘ flicking a bit of snow ’ , while ‘ another was put in isolation for touching it ’			2
the mother added : ‘ the school has been in freefall since it became an academy last year			2
‘ homework is sporadic , teachers are leaving and no one will talk to parents			2
‘ when my daughter came home and said what had happened it was the last straw			0
’ the school was put into special measures following an @entity138 inspection in 2013 and was converted into an academy last may			0
it is now run by @entity141 , which runs two other schools in @entity144			0
@entity0 , the trust ’s chief executive , was not available to comment yesterday			0
a message posted on the school ’s facebook page after the snowfall last monday said : ‘ we acknowledge that snow is an unusual and exciting occurrence for everyone , especially children			1
‘ the academy ’s playgrounds were extremely icy so it was felt that in the interests of safety and in line with our risk assessment under health and safety , that children were brought inside at the start of the day			1
’ the notice added that the teacher who closed the blinds ‘ noted the heavy snowfall was having an impact upon the learning of the children ’ and acted to ensure that ‘ children focused on the tasks in hand ’ .			0
