by @entity0 published : 06:56 est , 15 february 2014 @entity2 : 10:26 est , 15 february 2014 a woman who kept an moving daily diary of her battle against leukaemia has told her thousands of loyal readers she is in remission			1
@entity9 from @entity10 - upon - @entity11 , @entity12 , was diagnosed in april last year and in june she started a day - by - day account of her gruelling rounds of chemotherapy , radiotherapy , blood transfusions , drugs and a bone marrow transplant			1
with the help of her husband @entity22 , 34 , the editor of local newspaper the @entity24 , the 33 - year - old 's journal appeared in print and gave her a huge following			1
within two months blood and bone marrow donors in her town had risen 15 per cent as readers were inspired by her messages of goodwill			1
scroll down for extracts from @entity9 's diary start chilling the champagne : @entity9 , pictured with her husband @entity22 , has gone into remission from chronic myeloid leukaemia after keeping a daily diary about her battle with the illness achievement : she prompted a boost in blood and bone marrow donations and donated old stamps to charity columnist : mrs @entity9 's diary was published in the local newspaper where her husband ( right ) works today mrs @entity9 , a teacher , revealed she has gone into remission - and her first act was to apologise for not saying so earlier			1
' i need to say a little " sorry " to my loyal followers , ' she wrote online			1
' many of you will have been checking my diary on a regular basis to discover news of my clinic visit on wednesday			2
the news was exceptionally pleasing - i am in remission			2
trial : her diary included the problems of wearing a wedding dress without medical lines showing ' as i continue to be the face of leukaemia and stem cell donor campaigns across much of @entity12 and @entity75 , we agreed not to reveal the news until today			1
' it 's too early to pop the @entity79 corks as further tests are still needed on the bone marrow biopsy , but it 's safe to say that the @entity79 can go in the fridge to start chilling			1
' i 'm still a regular visitor to the hospital and this will continue for years as leukaemia can be a tricky customer			1
' the first two years following a transplant are important , as statistics show that if the leukaemia is going to return at any time , it is most likely to happen within the first two years			1
' once i reach the five - year remission milestone , it 's fairly safe to say that i am fully cured '			2
the news came 100 days after mrs @entity9 had a bone marrow transplant from a @entity98 donor in a bid to beat her disease , which is known as chronic myeloid leukaemia ( @entity102 )			1
her diary included battling the disease to go to a wedding , struggling to put up @entity106 decorations , watching her hair fall out and pledging a new year 's resolution to give back to cancer charities in 2014			2
even though she is in remission , mrs @entity9 is still suffering from various conditions including @entity112 , which happens when her body attacks the donor bone marrow cells			1
symptoms include a sore mouth , stinging legs and patches of dry skin and will need regular hospital treatment			2
she said : ' it 's going to be a very long and complicated road back to full health , but at least i am currently free of leukaemia			1
' @entity9 , 33 , said : ' it 's too early to pop the @entity79 corks as further tests are still needed on the bone marrow biopsy , but it 's safe to say that the @entity79 can go in the fridge to start chilling ' illness : mrs @entity9 had chronic myeloid leukaemia , which affects around 600 people a year in @entity134 around 600 people a year in @entity134 are diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia			1
unlike other forms of the illness , it is not common in children and develops very slowly so sufferers can take a long time to realise they are ill , or what their condition is			0
it occurs when patients have too many abnormal white blood cells called granulocytes , which build up in the spleen and bone marrow and prevent usual levels of blood cells from being produced			1
the condition can be treated in some people with a bone marrow transplant , but donor matches are much harder to find than with blood			1
health authorities have to campaign hard for people to sign the register , which is run by the @entity161 charity			1
inspiration : @entity9 ( pictured ) kept the diary since june last year monday , june 24 , 2013 ( first entry ) : admitted to hospitalfollowing my appointment with professor @entity167 last wednesday , i was told to arrive today with my overnight bag packed			1
at my appointment today , professor @entity167 told me that the results from the bone marrow test showed i was in blast crisis phase and so i was admitted to ward 625			1
i was assigned to a private room and was given a tour of the ward and visited by the doctor			0
tests were taken for @entity178 and @entity179			0
saturday , july 6the weather looks hot outside and as i am expecting more visitors than usual today , i enquire about venturing out of the ward			0
as i am still neutropenic the risk is too great to venture out of the ward and so the only sun i see today is that shining through my sixth floor window			0
sunday , @entity187 's taken a while , but i am now fairly confident that my hair is starting to fall @entity189 's not falling out by the hand full , but loose strands of my long locks are starting to depart at fairly frequent intervals			0
i may be lucky and it may just gradually start to thin , or it may fall out altogether - either way , i have wigs , a bandanna and hats at the ready			0
wednesday , @entity200 was has been my first full day at home since june 24			1
but despite being home , my medical treatment continues			0
the district nurse arrived to check and change my dressings first thing and then my day revolved around a timetable of tablets , creams and medicines			1
i managed to venture outdoors to the convenience store but this was quite a challenge - i 'm not used to walking more than 50 metres at any one time			0
it 's going to take a while before my energy levels return to normal			0
saturday , september @entity218 was a very rare change for me - we went off to @entity221 for a wedding			0
the houses of @entity224 to be precise			0
of course i had to be armed with a bag full of medicines and my emergency medical card just in case i was taken ill , but we made it			0
choosing what to wear is now made increasingly tricky because of my @entity232 - anything too low - cut and you can see the dressing over where the tubes protrude			0
a new technique of hair nets and hair clips also meant that i managed to wear my wig and a hat all day - and until i told them , nobody even knew it was a wig			1
there comes a time when people ask you where you had your hair done , that you have to break it to them that it came out of a box			0
tuesday , october 29 – @entity253 day has come – the day when i am going to receive my stem cell transplant			1
it ’s funny in life how certain dates attract a lot of activity and october 29 is one of those dates for us			0
not only is october 29 the day i am due to receive my cells , it would also be my late mother ’s birthday , my late brother - in - law ’s birthday , and was also the day when one of my aunts died			2
unfortunately , storm @entity269 had made its way over to @entity98 and was playing havoc with the flights			0
my cells did arrive in the ward on october 29 – at around 11pm - but it was just after midnight when they were finally up on the drip stand			0
sunday , december @entity277 is the day when we would normally decorate the house in preparation for @entity106			2
we have a few decorations in place , but nothing to the scale as it usually is because i do not have the energy and there is only so much one person can do on their own			0
instead of ' decking the halls ' in a single day , i think it will be done over several days or even weeks			2
tuesday , december @entity293 today marks the end of another year , it fills me with optimism for the year to come			0
this past year has n’t been particularly joyous – with the bombshell of discovering i had leukaemia being dropped in april			2
2014 will certainly be the year when we do all we can to help the charities which have supported me in one way or another through a troublesome 2013			0
saturday , february 15 , @entity300 need to say a little ' sorry ' to my loyal followers			2
many of you will have been checking my diary on a regular basis to discover news of my clinic visit on wednesday			0
the news was exceptionally pleasing - i am in remission			0
as i continue to be the face of leukaemia and stem cell donor campaigns across much of @entity12 and @entity75 , we agreed not to reveal the news until today			2
