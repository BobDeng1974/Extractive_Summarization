by @entity1 reporter former members of the @entity3 have revealed even they considered the elderly @entity4 who allegedly shot dead three people in an anti-semetic rage ' a loose cannon			1
' @entity8 , an ex-national leader in the @entity3 with the title @entity10 , said tuesday that he chose to stay away from @entity11 aka @entity11 , who is charged with three counts of murder in the @entity14 killing spree sunday			1
' i wanted nothing to do with him			0
i knew he was a lose cannon , ' @entity8 said			1
' @entity27 , another reformed @entity3 member , also questioned the man 's character			1
he told the news website that he believed going around with the 73 - year - old would make him a ' more violent person			1
' ' he stood out as a really violent person , ' @entity27 said			2
' at the time , i probably did n't have enough sense to be scared			0
i was indoctrinated into that life and i believed everything they said			0
' separate hate crime charges are expected to be filed later			0
he is the prime suspect in the horror shooting that targeted a @entity48 and retirement center			0
the startling character judgements came as @entity14 prosecutors filed state - level murder charges against the white supremacist			1
@entity11 has been charged with one count of capital murder for the deaths of 14 - year - old boy and his grandfather outside the @entity59			1
hateful : @entity11 , pictured , appeared to target @entity61 but none of his victims in fact belonged to the faith charged : @entity11 , 73 , now faces three counts of murder and is expected to have hate crimes brought against him following the triple homicide on sunday at two @entity48 facilities near @entity14 @entity11 also faces one count of first - degree , premeditated murder for the death of a woman who was gunned down while visiting her mother at a nearby retirement complex			1
the capital murder charge carries the death penalty as possible punishment and @entity11 is being held on $ 10million bond			2
the 73 - year - old @entity83 veteran is scheduled to appear in court at 1.30pm tuesday in @entity86 @entity85			1
@entity11 was arrested sunday after shooting and killing three people at two different @entity48 centers in @entity14 , @entity14			1
@entity11 is from southwest @entity89 who founded the @entity91 in his native @entity92 and later the @entity91			2
none of sunday 's victims were @entity48 : dr. @entity95 , 69 , and his grandson @entity96 , 14 , were at the community center for a singing contest audition , while 53 - year - old @entity99 was visiting her mother at the retirement complex			1
familiar : @entity11 , seen during his arrest on sunday and in the subsequent mugshot , was put in witness protection in 1987 in exchange for testimony on fellow @entity3 members the @entity107 also monitors , to varying degrees , the activities of hundreds of known white supremacists and anti-semites at any given time			1
federal authorities were well - aware of the racist war vet , as were the @entity107 and the @entity115 , who sometimes was known as @entity11			2
after a 1986 contempt - of - court conviction in @entity92 for operating a paramilitary camp , @entity11 went in hiding while free on bond and fled to @entity89			1
there , federal agents found him and several other men in a rural mobile home stocked with hand grenades , automatic weapons and thousands of bullets			0
@entity11 entered federal witness protection programs in 1987 , according to @entity128 , and agreed to cooperate with authorities			2
it is not clear when the protection ended			0
indicted on weapons charges and accused of plotting robberies and the assassination of @entity107 founder @entity135 , @entity11 served three years in federal prison but avoided a longer sentence in exchange for testifying against more than a dozen other @entity3 leaders			1
victims : dr. @entity141 , and his grandson @entity96 ( left ) were at the @entity48 for a singing competition while @entity99 ( right ) was visiting her mother at a @entity48 assisted living facility			0
none of the victims were @entity48 ' we were aware he was affiliated with certain hate groups , ' @entity148 special agent @entity147 said at a monday press conference			0
federal prosecutors say there 's enough evidence to warrant putting the case before a grand jury as a hate crime			0
moving the case from state to federal prosecutors would likely mean tougher punishments if @entity11 is convicted			2
' the motivation behind these attacks was a hate crime ... he was trying to hurt someone based on race or ethnicity , â € ™ @entity148 agent @entity147 said at a monday press conference			0
before the shootings , @entity11 had been contemptuous of some of his like - minded allies ' reliance on social media over violent confrontation			2
' he felt it was easy to be a ' keyboard commando , ' but that the only way activists will ever succeed is by going out on the streets , ' said @entity180 , the vice president of the @entity181 on @entity182			0
history of violence : authorities were aware of @entity11 ( who also went by the name @entity187 ) since the early 1980s when he founded the @entity91 , seen here in 1984 racist : in recent years , watchdog groups were aware of @entity190 , seen here in an undated photo , and viewed him as a possible threat but because he had stopped posting as often , they became less concerned @entity180 said his group made a presentation on white supremacists to the @entity48 in august , a discussion that included a description of @entity190 as an example of dangerous anti-semitic figures in the region			2
it was n't clear what , if any , steps were taken by the center to act on the information			0
the timing of the attack is worth noting , as a group monitoring anti-semitic attacks in the @entity211 cautiously reported a sharp decline in such incidents less than two weeks before this weekendâ € ™ s attack			0
in a report april 1 , the @entity115 noted a 19 per cent drop in anti-semitic incidents last year compared to 2012 , part of what the group called a ' decade - long downward slide ' and one of its lowest tallies since it started keeping such records in 1979 .			0
