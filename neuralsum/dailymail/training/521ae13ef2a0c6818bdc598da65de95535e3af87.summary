by @entity0 published : 18:28 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 03:21 est , 25 september 2013 when it came to chucking - out time at @entity3 parties , it was my job to make sure all the guests actually left			1
no matter how many glasses they ’d had , you did n’t want people walking past desks with confidential papers and taking a peek			1
on occasion , though , i had the opposite role , standing at the exit holding back furious journalists and civil servants trying to make last orders at the @entity19 on the grounds that @entity21 was still broadcasting live outside and half of them could n’t stand up			1
@entity24 time : a social gathering on the @entity28 ; but for others it can spiral out of control alcohol is integral to the culture of @entity33 and @entity34 , @entity30 claims @entity33 is the binge - drinking capital of @entity36			1
compared with now , i look back at the way i lived then with disbelief			1
at the time , though , i could n’t believe my luck			1
by the age of 25 , when i was working as a civil servant for @entity42 before being taken on by @entity43 , i was already — by any measure — an alcoholic			1
i used to walk past @entity45 in @entity46 at 7 am and often conclude that it made perfect sense for me to do my paperwork in one of the 24 - hour bars rather than at my desk			1
when i landed a job at the @entity55 , life became more complicated			1
i had to be on call for ministers at any time , and the day was usually so busy with meetings that i could n’t just slope off to the pub. so my daily routine became a quick two pints while going out ‘ to get a sandwich ’ at lunchtime , two hours in the pub with colleagues straight after work , then back to the @entity55 with a six - pack to do another three hours ’ work			1
i ’d have a can on the @entity69 and another four at home , before falling asleep on the sofa			1
occasionally , i ’d arrive at the @entity55 knowing i ’d done three hours ’ work the previous night — but not remembering what it was			1
as time went on , my choice of alcohol was largely unchanged — lager and white wine , usually at the same time — but my levels of consumption grew ever worse			1
it certainly did n’t help that my role as @entity43 ’s spin doctor only really required me to be at the end of a phone both to him and the media			1
or that i was practically encouraged to take journalists for boozy lunches , long afternoons in the pub and late - night karaoke sessions			1
the occasions when i could n’t remember the previous night ’s events became more frequent and more worrying			1
once , i tried to obtain entry to the @entity55 at 2 am and had a rambling row with the custodian — only for his supervisor to come down and tell me i was outside the @entity100			1
in september 2003 , on one of my first overseas trips as the @entity55 ’s head of communications , we all gathered at the end of the day in the recreation room at the @entity36 embassy in @entity109 to watch @entity111 v @entity110			1
i sat down with 15 cans of beer and started drinking at a ridiculous pace			2
when @entity115 missed a penalty , i jumped up and yelled at the screen : ‘ have that , you * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ! you cheating * * * * * * ! ’ it was only then that i realised quite how many children were in the room , as well as the ambassador and his family			2
there was one man who always resisted alcohol , one politician who exemplified dipso - discipline ¿ and that was @entity130 , his former spin doctor says @entity43 looked horrified , @entity131 rather amused			1
and yet i can barely remember anyone in my entire time in the civil service or politics taking me to one side and telling me to take it easy			2
that ’s partly because alcohol is so integral to the culture of @entity33 and @entity34 , that while i was seen as a big drinker , i was n’t totally beyond the norm			1
when @entity144 famously peed in the flowerbeds at a no. 10 reception for the 2005 @entity148 victors , the reaction of many hardened @entity33 drinkers was : ‘ sounds a bit tame			2
’ indeed , it ’s no exaggeration to say that i ’d still be an alcoholic if i ’d remained in my job			2
who could avoid the summer and @entity154 parties when politicians and government departments always bought far more booze than was necessary ? booze that , naturally , everyone felt they had to finish off			1
but there was one man who always resisted , one politician who exemplified dipso - discipline — and that was @entity43			2
he was quite capable of nursing the same glass of wine for two hours at a @entity3 reception			2
despite this , he showed tremendous tolerance when i missed morning meetings or flights to @entity170 , and fell over or dropped glasses at receptions			2
once , in front of half the @entity55 staff , i ’d had a one - sided physical altercation with a civil servant during a quiz night , and @entity43 was told to speak to me about it			2
power trip , the book by former @entity180 spin doctor @entity0 , reveals all in his new book bashfully , he addressed me about controlling my temper — but mentioned nothing about the fact i was drunk			1
on the odd occasion when he came into my office late at night , he ’d even manage to ignore the eight empty cans of lager on the desk			2
but that was because no matter how far gone i might be , i retained the ability to talk to him coherently and authoritatively about what was in tomorrow ’s papers and what our line should be			2
except once , in 2006			2
i ’d just returned from a friend ’s stag do in @entity201 , which had ended with a sunday football match at @entity203 — so i ’d been drinking for 36 hours			0
@entity43 called at the end of the game and asked me what was going to be in the papers			0
i barely knew what day it was			0
staggering through a beer garden , i rambled incoherently and then shouted : ‘ it ’s words			0
it ’s just ink , @entity43			0
’ my friends from the stag do were sitting on the wall of the pub , killing themselves laughing			0
‘ mm - hmm , i see , ’ said @entity43			0
then he added gently : ‘ and , erm , what will be in the @entity224 ? ’ he kept up the conversation for ten minutes , working his way through every paper and letting me dig myself ever deeper into the hole			0
finally , he said : ‘ well , thank you , @entity0			1
’ @entity43 was n’t averse to some reflected glory when it suited him			0
in 2009 , the celebrities who ’d climbed @entity236 for @entity237 were invited to a no 10 reception with local schoolchildren and , while there was a great cast list due to attend , the real star was @entity242			0
@entity242 and @entity244 bandmate @entity243 were very late to the event , meaning @entity130 - and a very annoyed @entity246 - had to wait there was an art to timing @entity43 ’s arrival at these things			0
we ’d keep all the celebrities who arrived early in a holding room and tell them they ’d be going into the main reception just as soon as @entity43 had finished his phone call with the @entity258 prime minister — always our default excuse when we wanted to say he was busy			1
what we ’d really be doing was waiting for the biggest star to arrive , so he could walk into the reception alongside them for the benefit of the cameras , not to mention the screaming children			0
but obviously , you could n’t say to the other celebrities : ‘ sorry , guys , just waiting for the a-lister to arrive and then we can go in , ’ or they might be a tad put out			0
on this occasion , @entity242 and @entity244 bandmate @entity243 were very late , @entity43 was waiting to be summoned from his flat , and the various other stars in the holding room were beginning to get a bit peeved at waiting			0
eventually , the back gates of @entity3 swung open , a swanky car pulled in and one of the guards gave a thumbs - up			0
we got @entity43 down straight away and he marched into the holding room , apologising profusely to the other celebrities for the wait and just giving time for @entity242 magically to arrive right on cue behind him			0
there was still no @entity242			0
‘ can we just hold on , everyone , ’ i said			0
‘ we just need to warn the kids upstairs that you ’re coming up			0
’ we did n’t really			0
they were getting almost as bored of waiting as the celebrities , but we needed some excuse for the extra delay			0
colleagues went running all round the building looking for where @entity242 and @entity243 had got to , and one eventually rushed up and whispered that they were on their way			0
one of our most star - struck special advisers had intercepted them at the back door and taken them for a quick look round the @entity305 room			0
i mentally started revving up my chainsaw , but said calmly : ‘ @entity43 , apparently two other guests have just arrived — so let ’s just hold on for them			0
’ the eventual moment of @entity43 walking in with @entity242 to the screams of the kids was great — apart , that is , from @entity246 scowling in the background			0
it came as little surprise to me when he came out for the @entity317 at the 2010 election			0
