by @entity0 published : 07:09 est , 26 july 2012 updated : 10:27 est , 26 july 2012 snooze channel : @entity3 's tv channel has been dubbed ' @entity4 ' after leader @entity5 , pictured it is hard to imagine there are too many people keen to watch council meeting proceedings as they happen			1
but , clearly , @entity3 thinks differently			1
the cash - strapped council spent £ 220,000 of taxpayers money on a tv channel to broadcast their meetings live			1
but the snooze channel only attracted 57 viewers for its last performance			2
viewing figures have plummeted as those who tuned in were exposed to ' terribly boring ' debates that often last for hours			2
councillors have also been blasted for ' in - fighting ' and talking ' waffle ' , as their debates are streamed worldwide over the internet			1
the cost works out a staggering £ 3869.65 per viewer for their last broadcast , which is 26 times more than a colour tv licence			2
one was even the daughter of a councillor who had tuned in from @entity29 to see what her father was doing			0
now there are calls for @entity3 to pull the plug on the scheme , dubbed ' @entity4 ' after their leader @entity5			1
the @entity38 - led council has axed 1,400 jobs since january 2011 in a bid to save £ 100million over two years			1
those who have lost their jobs include librarians , museum workers and administrative staff			2
@entity46 previously said : ' reducing our costs further will neither be easy or painless			0
' riveting : @entity3 streamed meetings to ' encourage greater understanding ' more than 800 people tuned in to watch the first televised budget in february when the ruling @entity53 approved cuts of £ 45million			1
but just 108 people watched may ’s meeting and a mere 57 tuned in to this month ’s meeting			0
a cabinet meeting in april was watched by 167 people , who tuned in live or delved into the council ’s video archive			1
conservative @entity46 revealed the figures at the most recent council meeting , adding : ' maybe @entity65 is more popular than the council			2
' he was heckled by a councillor on the @entity70 benches , who shouted out : ' more comedy ' , to laughter in the chamber			0
the council spent £ 223,000 on audio , video and web - streaming equipment and paying an outside company to operate it			1
county chiefs hoped the project would ' increase transparency ' and ' encourage greater understanding and participation ' in local decision making			0
a spokesman said at the time of launch : ' with so much of @entity93 being rural in nature , residents from all corners of the county who may not normally have the opportunity to attend meetings themselves , will be able to follow the discussions and debates that are streamed live over the internet , from a computer in their home , school or office			1
scene of the tv screens : @entity3 only attracted 57 viewers in its last broadcast ' it will also be possible to watch previously webcasted meetings			1
' viewers will be able to skip through to individual items on the agenda or to individual speakers , which will make meetings even more accessible and open to all			0
' by opening up some public meetings to a wider audience in this way , we hope that this will empower local residents and communities			0
' but councillor @entity70 , @entity70 opposition spokesman , said it was a ' waste of money '			0
he said : ' the @entity70 have always said this was a waste of money and could have helped keep library hours up or more buses or youth services in place			0
' it ’s always been a @entity38 vanity project			0
' @entity135 , from anti-council - tax group @entity134 , said : ' the tv channel is a waste of money			2
' i am not at all surprised it gets so few viewers because council meetings are terribly boring - even for someone like me who is interested in local politics			1
' mrs @entity135 said the broadcasts had a ' novelty value ' but viewers were turned - off by meetings that last for hours , ' waffle ' and party political in - fighting			1
however councillor @entity151 , who is responsible for communications at the council , said he was not disappointed by the viewing figures			2
@entity155 said the channel was a good use of taxpayers ’ money and added : ' these viewing figures are to be expected			0
' the first meeting was the budget setting meeting and there was a lot of interest			0
' the cabinet meeting also attracted interest as there was discussion about the amalgamation of a couple of schools			0
' my daughter watches from @entity29 to see what her father is up to			0
