by @entity0 published : 20:08 est , 6 april 2013 updated : 04:33 est , 7 april 2013 dressed in a boiler suit and wearing a gas mask the figure strapped to a treadmill , bending and moving in a variety of bizarre poses looks more like something out of a @entity13 episode than a member of the team at an @entity12 military hardware company			0
but when the unusual attire is removed , the figure below the suit is not a human but a specially designed robot capable of carrying out some unsettlingly lifelike moves			2
known as @entity21 , this startling realistic robot has been created by @entity22 to test out hazmat suits and a variety of military equipment			1
unlike previous suit testers that had a limited repertoire of motion and had to be supported mechanically , @entity21 can walk , bend and complete a variety of suit - stressing movements during exposure to chemical warfare agents			1
it may look like it is attached to the treadmill - but the wires coming from it are merely to supply power - @entity21 balances itself and moves all on its own			2
it also simulates human physiology within the protective suit by controlling temperature , humidity and sweating , all to provide realistic test conditions			2
let 's dance : more akin to the terminator than your average member of staff , @entity21 can simulate human physiology inside military clothing amazing : the company announced the production of the robot in 2008 but many doubted that such realistic humanoid technology could be created the company already wowed the world three years earlier when it produced its quadraped @entity79 robot for the @entity12 military			1
billed as ‘ the most advanced quadruped robot on @entity82 ’ , @entity79 was devised to support @entity12 troops by carrying up to four packs of equipment on awkward terrain unsuitable for wheeled vehicles			0
it announced the @entity21 project back in 2008 but many doubted that such realistic humanoid technology could be achieved			0
the startlinglingly realistic robot is now at a testing facility where it is being put through its paces			0
the next step is to put the robot into an exposure temperature where it will be tested against the likes of sarin and mustard gas			0
@entity102 stages : the @entity21 is currently at a testing facility and will soon be exposed to chemical agents such as mustard gas and sarin not human : looking more like a crash test dummy , the video shows the robot 's movements without a hazmat suit on video : @entity21 tests hazmat suit			1

the @entity21 robot is designed to test military clothing and equipment
it can balance , bend , walk and run like a human all on its own
