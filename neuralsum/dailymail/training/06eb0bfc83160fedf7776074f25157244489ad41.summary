it is now seven years since @entity1 was asked what he considered the biggest difference between managing the rivalry of @entity5 and @entity6 in the late 1980s and the then current enmity of @entity8 and @entity9			1
‘ the internet , ’ he said			2
it struck me as an extraordinarily insignificant development for the boss of @entity15 to be worrying about amid a multi-million - pound budget , a @entity18 fight and @entity19			2
social media , most pertinently @entity27 , has taken off , for the most part widening rather than deepening the debate ( or so i would contend as a hopeless reactionary )			2
everyone is an instant expert , even from his armchair			0
whether social media is good or bad , how an organisation , for our purposes an @entity34 team , delivers its news , controls its message and engages with its fans has changed irrevocably			2
we saw this when @entity42 tweeted that he had ‘ no problem ’ with his @entity48 team - mate @entity21 , having publicly fallen out with him at @entity44 last weekend over qualifying			1
‘ we ’ve been friends a long time , ’ said @entity8			1
‘ as friends we have our ups and downs			0
today we spoke and we ’re cool			0
’ as i wrote in a separate news piece about this on friday , the timing of the announcement was odd			0
i shall elaborate on my understanding of what happened in the hours leading to @entity8 ’s tweet			1
i spoke to @entity61 , the @entity48 chairman , friday morning			1
he said : ‘ i have to tell you that everything is fully under control			0
everything is back in order			0
‘ i spoke to @entity42 he said he would speak to @entity21			1
from my point of view there are no negatives			0
’ those quotes , and others from @entity61 , were going to form the main item in this column			1
to check a couple of points , i phoned a @entity48 spokesman			1
i specifically asked whether the two drivers had yet talked to each other			0
the spokesman said he did not know and thought it unlikely he could find out because @entity8 , he thought , was travelling across the @entity82 ahead of next weekend ’s race in @entity84			1
odd timing : @entity8 's @entity27 came at an odd juncture - after @entity61 had announced the pair had spoken just over an hour later , @entity88 issued a tweet encouraging viewers to contribute to a debate , on the @entity92 , tackling the fractious relationship between @entity8 and @entity21			1
eleven minutes after @entity88 ’s tweet , came @entity8 ’s tweet			2
so , were any of the events connected ? did @entity48 ’ corporate types want to take control of the agenda , rather than let @entity61 , who i suspect they think is too prone to go freelance with his views , set it ? did they wish to steer @entity88 ’s treatment of the subject towards a discussion of a rapprochement ? mercedes deny it , of course			1
the same spokesman told me that @entity42 tweeted independently of them , purely to reflect the updated situation			2
the spokesman ’s revised estimate of @entity42 ’ itinerary was that he was ‘ probably ’ travelling to @entity84 this weekend			1
under control : @entity48 chairman @entity61 claimed everything was fine between the pair i do n’t know whether my suspicions that @entity48 had a hand in the tweet are right – and who can blame them if they did ? it is someone ’s job to have the acumen to do so			1
a legitimate complaint from a journalist would be if the spokesman reacted to my call – in which i let him into the fact that @entity61 had spoken to me – by feeding a tweet to every rival and so ruining the exclusivity of my story , such as it was			1
did @entity8 send his tweet – and choose the perfect picture of himself and @entity21 on unicycles as boys to illustrate a long and fun association – all on his own ? did he not run it by anyone at the office of @entity148 , his manager ? or anyone at @entity48 ? i find it difficult to believe that he neglected to do so given the sensitivity of the last few days			1
that is the way communications work these days			0
we should at least be aware of this			0
we can then evaluate sensibly what is said , by whom , and how and when			0
denial : the @entity159 team deny there was anything untoward about the timing of @entity8 's tweet it is interesting to conjecture what the reaction would have been had @entity8 prevented @entity21 ’s flying lap rather than the other way around			1
i suspect some fans would be split along tribal lines , just as they are now ; that the stewards would have approached the incident as neutrally as they could ; and that commentators , among them ex-drivers , would still try to be honest in their reading of it			0
but if @entity8 were judged less sympathetically would that entirely be the fault of us observers ? for he has been attracted to controversy like a baby to milk throughout his @entity34 career ; @entity21 has been squeaky - clean			1
not that there are not upsides to @entity8 ’s headline - grabbing deeds , good and bad			2
only last week he was named the world ’s most marketable sportsman			0
his story in the round makes him what the @entity193 ’s call ‘ box office ’			0
squeaky clean : @entity21 has a clean record in comparison to @entity8 , who has attracted controversy in his spare days between defending himself against bribery charges in a @entity203 court , @entity200 has been trying to sell shares belonging to the sport ’s largest shareholders , @entity207			1
but i can reveal that talks with @entity84 fashion tycoon @entity210 , whose interest in buying into @entity34 was first reported by @entity88 , have broken down			2
with @entity34 ’s other investors nervous about @entity200 ’s future , the sport ’s future remains in flux			0
@entity217 , the driver steward in @entity44 , explained to @entity218 how the panel came to their decision not to penalise @entity21			1
i have read that offering this explanation in print and online compromised his independence			0
no , that is a non-sequitur			0
i am more inclined to thank him for his transparency			0
i liked @entity229 ’s line after his driver @entity231 ’s ninth place for @entity232 last weekend			2
‘ trust us to score our first points in @entity44 – we ca n’t afford to celebrate , ’ he said , hinting humorously at his team ’s belief that they do not receive an equitable share of the sport ’s profits			2
but am i alone in detecting an irony in what @entity229 – who is grandiloquently called @entity232 ’s president – said ? running @entity34 cars in the plutocrats ’ playground of @entity44 is hardly the breadline			0
off the mark : @entity231 fianlly scored @entity249 's first points after finishing ninth in @entity44			0

@entity61 told me the @entity8 and @entity21 had spoken
but that was at odds with a @entity48 spokesman telling me that the @entity257 driver was likely on a plane to @entity84
the pair have been *feuding* all *season*
but has the team made sure , publicly at least , that everything is fine ?
