the @entity0 is embroiled in a row over proposals to sweep away laws that forbid a full @entity5 funeral to people who have taken their own lives			2
most clergy now regard suicide with far more sympathy than when ‘ self murder ’ was still a crime , and the move will be seen as reflecting a growing acceptance as more @entity15 choose to end their lives in clinics such as @entity18 in @entity19			1
but some critics within the @entity0 say the reforms will ‘ legalise ’ suicide , which should still be regarded a serious sin			1
u-turn : most clergy now regard suicide with far more sympathy than when ‘ self murder ’ was still a crime one senior member said : ‘ the @entity0 has always opposed suicide on the basis of the commandment @entity30 , and that includes yourself			1
’ the move comes as @entity36 peer @entity35 ’s @entity34 , which says terminally - ill patients must make a ‘ voluntary ’ and ‘ informed ’ decision to end their lives before they can be helped to do so , faces further debate in the @entity41 later this month			0
those to welcome the possible @entity0 move include art critic @entity44 , who revealed in an article two years ago that he would be prepared to take his own life if he became very ill. mr @entity44 said : ‘ one of the most unchristian things a church can do is to refuse a proper burial to those that commit suicide			2
it is one of those petty meannesses that date back centuries and the @entity0 should give consideration to this and deal with it fairly promptly			0
’ under centuries - old @entity0 rules , it is technically illegal for clergy to use official funeral services to bury those who have ‘ laid violent hands ’ upon themselves , particularly while of ‘ sound mind ’ , although in reality the law is almost universally ignored			1
art critic @entity44 revealed in an article two years ago that he would be prepared to take his own life if he became very ill the @entity0 ’s @entity69 meets next month , when members will call for @entity72 law to be reformed so that clergy who use the @entity0 ’s rites to bury those who have taken their own life in any circumstances are no longer in breach of the law			1
under the current @entity0 law , @entity80 , clergy are supposed to use a modified funeral service for people who have taken their own lives while of sound mind when they killed themselves , to reflect the @entity0 ’s concerns about suicide			1
@entity36 peer @entity35 ’s @entity34 , says terminally - ill patients must make a ‘ voluntary ’ and ‘ informed ’ decision to end their lives but no alternative service has ever been approved by @entity69 , despite several reports into the issue over the past 50 years , and the vast majority of the @entity69 is expected to support the proposed reforms			1
leading the calls for reform , @entity72 @entity96 said many clergy were not even aware of what was an outdated law and were mainly concerned to treat the relatives and friends of the deceased with sensitivity			0
@entity105 , from @entity106 , said the change would bring the @entity0 into line with what was now common practice and would help shed lingering perceptions that clergy were ‘ hostile ’ to those who feel compelled to take their own lives			2
one @entity115 a fortnight is now believed to end his or her life at the @entity18 clinic and for every one that travels abroad , ten terminally ill people are thought to take their lives in this country , according to supporters of the legislation			0
but former government minister @entity125 , a vocal opponent of assisted suicide , said that by changing its laws the @entity0 might suggest it had diluted its principles			0
he said : ‘ the church is in danger of getting into a muddle because we can take a merciful view of people who kill themselves while the balance of their mind is disturbed			0
‘ but we are now looking at cases in which people who appear to be quite sane want to take their own lives			0
the @entity0 should think again			0

@entity142 now regard suicide with far more sympathy than before
but some critics within the @entity0 say the reforms will ‘ legalise ’ suicide
it is illegal for clergy to use official funeral services to bury suicide *victims*
but no alternative services have ever been approved by @entity69
