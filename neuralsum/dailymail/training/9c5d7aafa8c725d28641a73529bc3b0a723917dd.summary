by @entity0 and @entity1 ruling : sir @entity2 @entity4 's most senior policeman has failed in an attempt to use secret court hearings to force journalists and whistleblowers to hand over confidential material			1
@entity10 boss sir @entity2 used a secret hearing to try to make @entity12 – owners of @entity14 – reveal correspondence between one of its reporters and sources within the @entity19			1
the broadcaster successfully appealed against the decision in the @entity22 but the @entity23 was still determined to overturn the ruling and establish the principle that it could submit secret evidence in closed hearings , and took the case to the @entity29			1
however , @entity30 understands that the @entity29 has rejected his demand			0
its ruling is due to be published on wednesday			2
requests for ‘ production orders ’ – in which a judge can order journalists to hand over notebooks , photographs , videos and other material – must currently be made in open court , with media organisations given the opportunity to argue their case			0
sir @entity2 ’s bid to overturn the arrangement was seen by critics as further evidence of the judicial system ’s drift towards ‘ secret justice ’			1
despite his failure , a proposed change in the law might yet enable judges to authorise the seizure of journalistic material in closed hearings			1
campaigners and lawyers have warned that the measure – in a little - known clause in the @entity63 that aims to cut red tape – threatens press freedom			0
@entity66 said that any procedure enabling the police to obtain evidence in secret removes the ‘ safeguard that justice must always be seen to be done ’			2
there is also concern it would deter potential whistleblowers from coming forward to expose wrongdoing			0
the @entity23 brought the case following the arrest in march 2011 of an @entity19 soldier accused of leaking sensitive intelligence reports to @entity80 , who at the time was the defence correspondent of @entity14			1
the officer , known only as @entity83 , was with his young son when his car was dramatically intercepted by armed counter-terrorism officers near @entity88			0
another @entity19 officer , a 35 - year - old man working in signals , was arrested on the same day and both men were accused of breaching the @entity93			2
according to court documents , it was claimed that ‘ communications evidence ’ showed @entity80 , now @entity14 ’s @entity96 correspondent , was receiving information originating from meetings of the government ’s @entity101 emergency committee , including details of military operations			0
the @entity23 brought the case following the arrest in march 2011 of an @entity19 soldier accused of leaking sensitive intelligence reports to @entity80 ( pictured centre ) , who at the time was the defence correspondent of @entity14 @entity112 officials carried out a covert operation before passing the soldiers ’ names to the @entity23 ’s @entity116			1
the @entity23 was granted a production order against @entity12 , demanding emails between @entity80 and the soldiers and other information			2
the judge granted the order after receiving evidence from the @entity23 that was not disclosed to the broadcaster			2
however , @entity12 successfully appealed against the decision in the @entity22			1
the production order was quashed and the procedure to use secret evidence at a closed hearing was deemed ‘ unlawful ’			1
allegations against the two soldiers were eventually dropped last year			0
soldier @entity83 , who was suspended for eight months , resigned from the @entity132 in disgust at the lack of support from senior officers			0
he is now suing @entity10 for wrongful arrest and imprisonment			0
his lawyer , @entity139 , remains convinced that the @entity23 presented illegal ‘ intercept ’ evidence during the secret hearing			1
he has complained to @entity10 ’s @entity143 alleging ‘ their officers may have been guilty of unauthorised disclosure of intercepted communications ’			0
in a speech last month , @entity148 , president of the @entity29 , made clear his concerns about new powers in the @entity152 that could allow more cases to be heard in private			0
he pointed to a recent ruling by the @entity29 in which judges were ‘ able to make some pretty strong statements to discourage advocates from seeking closed material procedures , and to discourage judges from agreeing to adopt such procedures ’ .			2
