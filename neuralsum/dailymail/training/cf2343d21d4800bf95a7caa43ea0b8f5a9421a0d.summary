over the past six months @entity1 has bought seven technology companies that each specialise in robotics or automated systems			1
these include @entity12 , which makes humanoid robots , and @entity15 , which specialises in machines that can package goods and load up lorries , for example			1
@entity1 has recently bought seven companies that specialise in robotics including @entity23 - based @entity22 , which makes humanoid robots , pictured			1
the firm is n't expected to make these technologies available to consumers but instead could use them to automate deliveries of goods over the past six months , @entity1 has bought seven technology companies that specialise in robotics and automated systems : @entity12 , in @entity7 and @entity37 firm @entity35 both design and make humanoid robots			1
@entity7 - based @entity40 , and sister company @entity39 , make systems designed for filmmakers in which cameras are attached to precision - motion machines			0
@entity1 has worked with @entity46 on various advertising campaigns			0
@entity48 , also in @entity7 , designs robotics arms used in hospitals and factories , while @entity52 specialises in systems that accelerate vehicles in different directions			0
finally , @entity15 in @entity23 specialises in machines that can package goods and load up lorries , for example			1
@entity1 ’s investment in these firms has been led by @entity61 , the founder of its android operating system			0
while the firm is not expected to make these technologies available to consumers , it could instead use them to automate deliveries of goods , for example			1

@entity1 also bought @entity37 firm @entity35 that , like @entity12 , designs and makes humanoid robots			1
@entity1 could use the robots to create an automated delivery network , similar to @entity15 's , pictured the company has n’t confirmed , or denied , exactly what the robots will be used for but co-founder @entity113 wrote on @entity114 : ‘ i am excited about @entity61 's next project			2

' it is still very early days for this , but i ca n't wait to see the progress			0
’ and it may take years for the plans to be fully announced , or even became available , as @entity61 explained to he @entity80 : ' like any moonshot , you have to think of time as a factor			0
we need enough runway and a 10 - year vision			0
' at the start of this week @entity133 unveiled its own secret research project which it claims will be the future of home delivery - packages delivered by drones			2
the internet shopping giant ’s chief executive @entity140 says that he wants to use octocoptors to replace postmen and cut delivery times to just 30 minutes			0
customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber			0
@entity1 's news comes just days after @entity133 announced plans to roll out a drone delivery service in ' four to five years ' that could allow customers to receive packages within 30 minutes of placing an order			1
