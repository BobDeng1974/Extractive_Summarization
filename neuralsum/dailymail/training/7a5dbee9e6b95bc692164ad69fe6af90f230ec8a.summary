' @entity1 , who likely watched coverage of the dinner on television , may have just upset that she did n't get any invitations to this year 's events			1
she certainly had no harsh words for the dinner two years ago , when she attended two star - studded after - parties - one hosted by @entity25 and @entity26 and the other hosted by @entity27			1
she was also spotted the morning of the dinner at multimillionaire @entity31 's @entity30 abode for an exclusive brunch			1

' @entity1 's remark was retweeted more than 2,000 times and it was ' favorited ' nearly 1,000 times the post garnered more than 44,000 ' likes			2
' the dinner has become a target of criticism over the years as media companies compete for the most high - profile guests , many of them celebrities			2
in that vein , many say the dinner - which has been a tradition since the 1920s - is now less a celebration of the work that reporters do in covering the administration , and more of an opportunity for media and politicians to schmooze with @entity86 's biggest stars			0
some journalists , such as @entity88 , have refused to attend the dinner as its list of attendees from @entity86 expands			0
' somewhere along the line , it began to freewheel out of control , ' @entity88 told @entity96 of the dinner			0
the ' breaking point ' for him , he said , was @entity100 's attendance last year as a guest of @entity103 ' @entity102			0
party girl : @entity37 attends the @entity41 / @entity42 / people / @entity44 @entity7 ' dinner cocktail party at the @entity106 on april 30 , 2011			1
