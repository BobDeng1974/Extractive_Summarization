by @entity0 there are nearly as many @entity4 students doing masters degrees in @entity6 as there are @entity9 students , it emerged today			1
in total , three quarters of all masters students at @entity6 universities are foreign , according to figures from the @entity15			1
however , the proportion of overseas student fell between 2010 and 2013 thanks to rising fees and tough new visa restrictions - the first fall in numbers for three decades			2
students : there are nearly as many @entity4 as @entity9 people doing full - time masters degrees ( file photo ) the number of full - time postgraduate students from @entity4 studying in @entity6 last year was 28,390 - up nine per cent on the year before			1
out of all students doing full - time taught masters degrees at an @entity6 university , 23 per cent were @entity4 , compared to 26 per cent who were from the @entity9			1
@entity4 students were most dominant in maths and media studies , making up more than half the total foreign intake , with high numbers in business , engineering and architecture			1
the proportion of @entity4 students was boosted by a decline of around 50 per cent in the numbers coming from countries such as @entity45 and @entity46			2
@entity48 students traditionally favoured @entity9 universities thanks to cultural ties , but a tougher visa regime and a ban on students working in the @entity9 after graduation is believed to have driven them away			0
decline : the overall number of foreign postgraduate students has fallen for the first time in three decades the overall number of postgraduates in @entity6 from outside the @entity60 was 71,260 , down from a peak of 72,245 in 2010 - 11			1
by contrast , other countries including the @entity63 saw a rise in people coming to study , apparently benefiting from students shunning the @entity9			0
in addition , the number of undergraduate students coming from the @entity60 fell by a quarter in 2012 - 13 , apparently thanks to increased tuition fees of up to Â£ 9,000 a year			2
while @entity60 citizens are not required to obtain a visa to study at @entity6 universities , they must pay the same fees as students from the @entity9 , meaning the hike in prices has put them off			2
@entity9 students still dominate undergraduate courses , with 83 per cent of the total , while around half of those studying research - based masters degrees are from the @entity9			1
graduation : @entity9 students are still predominant in undergraduate and research masters degrees the @entity88 blamed @entity90 rhetoric on immigration for damaging @entity9 's international reputation as a leading destination for education			1
' international students make a huge contribution to academic and cultural life on campuses and in our cities , ' said general secretary @entity101			0
' they also make a valuable contribution to our economy			0
as we face continued uncertainty about the future of funding for our universities , the government should be doing more to encourage foreign students			0
' ministers need to recognise that attempts to sound tough on immigration at home are also reported elsewhere and it is not surprising if students consider studying in the countries that make an effort to welcome them			0
' professor @entity119 , chief executive of the @entity15 , said : ' this new analysis from @entity15 expands our understanding of global demand for @entity6 higher education			0
' international students enrich our universities and colleges - and our society - academically , culturally , and through their contribution to the economy			0
