after a lifetime of working hard , pensioners deserve to raise a toast to retirement			0
and these days they ’re doing just that – enjoying a daily tipple at 6.30pm			0
some prefer to crack open a bottle a little earlier , around 4pm , but others ca n’t even wait that long ... and say cheers with their first glass at lunchtime			0
researchers found the majority of pensioners are making the most of their later years with a packed diary of social engagements , days out , short breaks , holidays and shopping , as well as time spent outside ( file image ) with such a relaxed start to the day , it ’s no wonder that a poll of retirees aged 60 and over found 94 per cent are enjoying their post-work life , while half said they are having more fun than ever before			1
improvements in healthcare and living standards mean that these days pensioners have the energy to manage a hectic social diary , buoyed up by an average disposable income of £ 330 a month , which allows them to go on three holidays , two weekends away and 17 day trips a year			1
the survey found that 6.30pm is retirees ’ favourite time to enjoy a tipple or two			1
a third of those polled said they drink alcohol between 6pm and 7pm , while one in ten prefer a late afternoon drink between 4pm and 5pm , and a hardy one in 20 kick off their socialising between 1pm and 3pm			1
more than half said they drink wine , while the rest opt for spirits or beer			0
the study also showed that most pensioners eat out three times a month , but one in ten do so more than twice a week			1
this is despite family commitments , with retirees dedicating an average of six hours a week to looking after their grandchildren			0
of those who do not already care for grandchildren , two - thirds said they would like to in the future			2
the average retirement consists of a daily glass of wine at 6.30pm , research has found ( file picture ) most said they are active and exercise at least six times a month			2
the most popular activities are brisk walking , gardening and rambling			0
but a more ambitious 17 per cent participate in cycling , @entity79 or salsa dancing			2
and one in 20 take at least five weekend breaks in @entity82 every year			2
almost three - quarters said they feel a lot younger than their actual age , with the same proportion saying retirement is better than they expected			0
it ’s no wonder then that 20 per cent of those polled said they wish they had retired years ago			1
going on a cruise , taking up a new hobby and buying a dog are common achievements in the first year of retirement , while it lessons and losing weight were also popular among those polled			2
shortly after retiring , a third said they booked lunch dates with friends , a quarter revamped their house and one in ten signed up to @entity105			1
a glamorous few said they plan to or had already invested in makeovers or cosmetic surgery			0
@entity110 , which runs a rail discount scheme for train companies , polled 1,260 pensioners			0
@entity114 , of @entity115 , said : ‘ our poll showed that adults in their 60s , 70s and 80s are determined to make the most of life in retirement and have no intention of slowing down			1
‘ for so much of our lives we are restricted by our working hours , so if pensioners are filling their time with holidays , day trips and meals out , that can only be a good thing			1
‘ this research shows that retirees place a lot of importance on travel when they finish work			0
’ a separate report published yesterday said the average pensioner had made almost £ 1,200 a month from their home in the last six months			2
soaring property prices meant @entity148 homeowners were the biggest winners , making £ 20,700 a month since august , financial specialist @entity144 said			0
