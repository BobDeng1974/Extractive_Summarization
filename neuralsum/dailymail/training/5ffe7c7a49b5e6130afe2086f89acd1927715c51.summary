by @entity0 last updated at 11:27 pm on 19th january 2012 a clock collector was eagerly awaiting the delivery of an antique cuckoo timepiece from @entity4 , tracking each step of its progress toward his @entity9 home and counting down the minutes before he could hang it in his above his mantle			0
but much to his horror , footage from security cameras @entity15 installed showed an impatient @entity17 postal worker briefly checking the gate , and then hurling it over the fence into mr @entity15 ’s front yard			1
this comes a month after a string of delivery men came under fire for carelessly handling packages , and amidst dire times for the @entity28			1
‘ i looked and he pulled up , threw it ( the box ) over the fence , and then got in the van and drove off , ’ he told @entity49			1
though mr @entity15 immediately went out to confront the postal worker , the delivery man had already sped off			1
afraid to look : the box was thrown high over the fence and , despite the bubble wrap , suffered some damage damaged goods : owner @entity15 shows off the 1938 @entity62 cuckoo clock			1
after it was dropped , the chains no longer work and the second hand is bent he told the website that he knew his antique clock was going to be damaged based on the way it was thrown			0
upon inspection , the chains were broken , the second hand was bent and loose , and there could be more damage still			0
mr @entity15 said every generation in his family has owned a @entity62 @entity77 cuckoo clock , and he was looking forward to continuing the legacy			1
he decided to call and complain to @entity28 and said within ten minutes of phoning in , a representative was at his door			2
tick tock : @entity15 says collecting cuckoo clocks has been a family hobby for generations though the representative offered to take the clock for repairs , mr @entity15 wanted to hang onto it			2
he said : ‘ i will take it in and find me a repairman who works on antique clocks and have them repair it and i ’ll send them the bill			0
’ in response to the video showing the careless employee , @entity28 released a statement saying they were ‘ dismayed ’ to see the video			1
' i will take it in and find me a repairman who works on antique clocks and have them repair it and i ’ll send them the bill			0
' - clock owner @entity15 they said : ‘ that does not represent the kind of service we strive to provide our customers , ’ adding the incident is currently under investigation so they can take ‘ appropriate actions ’ regarding the clock - thrower			2
mr @entity15 told @entity49 that he does n’t think the man should lose his job			1

’ not so precious cargo : in december , a @entity135 delivery man tossed a @entity137 computer monitor over a fence going viral : the footage of the apathetic deliveryman became an internet sensation and even sparked a parody by @entity143 the cameras , he said , were for his wife ’s peace of mind			1
