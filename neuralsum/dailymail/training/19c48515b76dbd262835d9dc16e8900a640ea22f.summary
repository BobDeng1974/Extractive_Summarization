some ministers were worried the public might regard any changes as an affront to the @entity0 ’s younger sister			0
they were also worried about the timing of any new legislation , given continued speculation about princess @entity2 ’s private life			1
at the time she was involved in a romance with @entity39 group captain @entity38 , who was considered an unsuitable husband for her because he was divorced and a commoner			0
one document that details a @entity45 discussion of july 6 , 1953 , expressed the fear that ‘ if the @entity47 were introduced at this juncture , it might give rise to controversy owing to the publicity given by certain newspapers to reports linking the name of princess @entity2 with that of a commoner recently divorced ’			2

’ prime minister @entity87 backed the @entity89 ’s view that the change in the law should not be delayed , although his ability to influence matters was limited because a month earlier he had suffered a stroke			1
in a memo dated july 8 , 1953 , @entity87 was dismissive of the concern over press coverage , writing : ‘ the world does not come to an end because there is a caterwaul for two or three days ... i am for going ahead and am only sorry i can not take an active part in the dispute			0
’ in the event the @entity13 was passed in november 1953			0
