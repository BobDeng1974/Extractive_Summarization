by @entity0 published : 17:01 est , 13 december 2013 rags and riches : lord @entity3 with his wife @entity4 at @entity6 's 50th birthday what a happy , handsome couple they made on that hot july night 20 years ago			1
lord @entity3 , the second son of the @entity10 , and his effervescent blonde wife @entity11 were among the 250 revellers at @entity6 ’s 50th birthday party in @entity14			1
blue - blood lord @entity3 , known as @entity16 , made a rather improbable @entity18 revolutionary , and his wife — a former deb who is the daughter of the @entity22 , deputy chief whip in @entity25 ’s @entity24 — wore a towering white wig and came as @entity27			1
at the time they had not long returned from @entity29 , where @entity16 had run an art gallery			1
it was there he had met and befriended the @entity34 singer , and with his passion for music and playing the guitar , he fitted in well with @entity6 and his friends , yet witness @entity16 this week : frail , thin and ravaged by drugs , he is contemplating a financially painful divorce , and is threatened with jail			1
at @entity42 he admitted four counts of assaulting his wife over 21 years of their 30 - year marriage			1
one left her requiring hospital treatment			2
the judge warned him a custodial sentence is possible			2
so what has happened to @entity51 , second son of the 85 - year - old , 11th @entity10 , worth an estimated £ 135 million , whose title was created in 1682 and whose family line dates from the @entity56 kings of @entity57 in the 12th century ? this is a family many consider to be posher than the ‘ arriviste ’ windsors			1
@entity16 always had pretensions towards a bohemian , rock ’ n ’ roll lifestyle , and was sent to £ 30,000 - a - year @entity63 in @entity64			1
his elder brother , @entity65 , 61 , known to all his friends as @entity67 , is the @entity10 and heir to both the dukedom and the @entity71 estate			1
he is married to eco-campaigner @entity72 , now @entity73 , although it is said that this marriage is also in disarray			2
the younger brother , lord @entity77 , works as a music producer and has collaborated with @entity79 among others			1
he is divorced from the noted beauty @entity82 , who was a close friend @entity82			2
there is also a sister , @entity85 , a historical biographer			2
the family all live on the immense and magnificent @entity88 , 22,500 acres in the heart of the @entity91 countryside			2
the game of badminton was invented there in 1863 , it is the scene of the ultra-smart @entity96 attended by @entity97 , and home of the @entity99 where @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity65 have all ridden out in the past			2
estate : the family 's 22,500 acre @entity71 in the @entity91 countryside @entity51 married @entity105 in 1982 and afterwards the young couple went to @entity29 , where @entity16 worked in an art gallery part - owned by his father			2
@entity29 in the @entity109 was awash with cocaine , and @entity16 fell into druggy circles			2
‘ it was a very hedonistic lifestyle , ’ says a friend			2
tellingly , @entity16 appointed shipping heir @entity114 as the godfather of his first - born , @entity116 , nicknamed @entity117 , in 1984			2
@entity114 , known by the nickname ‘ another line ’ , died in 1999 from a massive cocaine overdose			2
he had taken 25 times more of the drug than would normally be considered fatal			2
by then @entity51 had developed a drug habit of his own			2
in 1986 , he was named during the trial of @entity125 for cocaine possession — his name appeared on a scrap of paper found at the house of @entity125 ’s dealer			0
the court heard @entity51 had bought cocaine three times from the dealer			0
in may 1988 , he checked into the @entity136 in @entity14			0
by now he had left his job at his father ’s art gallery and was described as a ‘ rock keyboardist ’			0
case : lord @entity142 arrives at @entity42 earlier this month when he emerged , he and @entity11 went to live in the exquisite @entity144 - listed @entity143 , which stands at the gates of @entity71			1
did he ever kick hard drugs ? there are doubts — the court heard drink and drugs were implicated in his attacks on his wife			1
indeed , there is an expectation medical reports will be produced before he is sentenced which will suggest his chronic drug habit has left him in very poor physical shape			0
he has been assigned a probation officer , who will report to the court before sentencing in february			0
@entity11 apparently started drinking heavily , too , and their relationship deteriorated — as one friend said , at times they would ‘ bring out the worst in each other ’			1
@entity11 ’s friends say that @entity16 was a ‘ compulsive and manipulative liar ’ , and the first of the admitted assaults came in 1990			1
the arrival of their second daughter , @entity173 , in 1992 , should have improved things , but it failed to make the union any happier			0
at @entity42 this week @entity16 ’s behaviour was described as a long campaign of domestic violence			0
initially , he denied all charges — then admitted to four counts of assault			1
another three charges will lie on file			0
@entity11 ’s injuries included bruising , scratches and hair - pulling in one attack			1
in another , it was bruising and a dislocated finger			0
in november 2011 , the court heard she suffered a ‘ deliberate and hard mis - aimed kick ’			0
friends say they have lived apart now for ‘ a couple of years ’ and it only came to court because @entity11 ended up in hospital in october 2012			1
hospital staff asked her how she ’d been injured , and called police			0
from then on a prosecution was inevitable			0
judge @entity202 told the aristocrat the offences were so serious a prison term was possible and he is considering a restraining order to protect @entity11 from him the estranged couple have not seen each other for a year and divorce proceedings are underway			1
@entity3 ’s lawyer , @entity210 , told the judge his client would not oppose a restraining order : ‘ he accepts his marriage is completely over			1
he thinks it best that he have no contact with the complainant , and she has no contact with him			0
’ it might be because @entity16 has been involved with a pretty blonde divorcee called @entity221 for some time			0
and it seems @entity11 is still very upset over being replaced by @entity221			1
@entity221 was married to events organiser @entity223 , dividing her time between a splendid houseboat in @entity225 and his family estate in @entity227			0
since that marriage ended , she has been flitting between a home in @entity230 and , increasingly , the @entity71 estate			0
happy times : @entity3 and @entity11 on their wedding day at @entity71 in 1982 one friend said : ‘ for some time now , @entity11 has been living in @entity14 and the marriage was drifting towards an end			1
however , @entity221 is very much on the scene now , and has moved into @entity143			0
it has made @entity11 very unhappy			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity11 is very glad the truth came out in court because the abuse and the violence had been going on for at least two years			1
’ the court heard that the family wanted her to drop the case in return for a financial settlement , but by then the @entity249 was involved and nothing could be done			0
‘ she says the liaison with @entity221 has been going on for years			1
she feels @entity221 has got what she wanted but will never be accepted like she was at @entity71 , and that the duke loved her			0
she says @entity16 and @entity221 live together at @entity143 , with @entity221 sleeping in her old bedroom and they have thrown out her clothes			0
’ @entity11 declined all offers of an interview this week , and is said to be trying to get on with her life			1
yet the question remains : why did she stay for so long ? perhaps there was fear , shame and an unwillingness to go through a divorce			0
possibly she feared its impact on the children			0
in court : @entity11 , pictured with her husband in 2008 , was asked to drop the case in return for financial settlement one friend explained : ‘ she was n’t strong enough to do anything about it			1
she really likes the family and particularly the duke			0
she was very loyal to him and as a result had reservations about going ahead with this			0
’ it must have been a relief when @entity16 pleaded guilty , then , as there was dread on both sides about airing dirty linen in public			0
there was the possibility of @entity117 , the eldest daughter , giving evidence			0
i ’m told two butlers and a housekeeper would also have been called to testify , along with a number of upper - crust friends of the couple			0
after @entity297 , @entity11 plans to visit @entity117 , who lives in @entity298			1
she expects to be out of the country when her estranged husband is sentenced			0
once the divorce is finalised , she plans to move on permanently			0
currently , she is in what she calls ‘ a small hovel in @entity304 ’ , but when lord @entity16 has made a settlement , she hopes to start a new life in @entity225			1
where @entity3 will be by then remains to be seen .			1

lord @entity3 admits four counts of assault on wife @entity11
may serve five years for attacks , which took place over 21 years
is second son of 11th @entity10 and estimated to be worth £ *85million*
