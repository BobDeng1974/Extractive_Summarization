i had @entity1 as strong favourite for the @entity4 title but now i am not so sure			1
i am feeling increasingly good vibes about @entity6			1
@entity1 ’s semi-final win was one of the strangest five - set matches i have seen in a long time			1
he seemed to be struggling with himself , with his breathing , and in technical terms with his backhand			2
that is the world no 1 ’s bread - and - butter shot , and it misfired so much he was lucky @entity16 did not take full advantage			1
@entity6 will make @entity1 play to his maximum in their clash on sunday @entity1 was in wayward form against @entity16 and missed a few bread and butter backhands with the way @entity6 has been playing , he wo n’t be so charitable			1
so , while a different @entity1 might show up for the final , i like the @entity28 ’s chances			1
@entity6 must stick with the aggressive game that has served him so well in getting this far , and the key for him is to stick with that big forehand and do what he did against @entity34			1
in the past he has shown a tendency to beat lesser opponents using his more defensive game and then tried to flick the switch towards a more attacking style when faced with the best			0
what has been encouraging here is that you could tell from the first round he was going to be aggressive			0
it is so much easier to keep that up and execute under pressure when you have been doing it from the start			0
@entity6 will look to flick on an attacking style of play when he plays against @entity1 @entity6 has done a good job of putting pressure on his opponents ’ first serve in this tournament			1
he is winning 36.6 per cent of first - serve return points , compared to 34 per cent in @entity58 last year			0
i have noticed quite a few changes			0
@entity6 ’s first serve has been excellent and that has allowed him to play a lot more one - two combinations in the manner you associate with @entity67 and @entity68 : get a fast and accurate first serve in and then follow it up with a big first strike			1
he has also shifted his court position slightly due to the confidence with which he is hitting his forehand			1
often before , when the ball was in the middle of the court , he favoured his backhand side , but he ’s been running around it more to hit the forehand — a sure sign of a feelgood factor			2
it has also been noticeable how many returns he has got back in play from first serves			0
@entity34 had been serving outstandingly but he could not make that count enough in the semi			0
of course , we know @entity6 is a great returner and a great mover , and in those departments he is back to what we saw in 2012 and up to @entity94 2013			2
all of the above must be replicated against @entity1 , as well as the way he has kept his frustrations to short flashes and recovered his composure when under pressure			2
he has got into a rhythm of playing his matches in the evenings since last sunday ’s fourth round on @entity105			0
and it will not hurt that @entity1 had a long match , and did n’t finish media commitments until well past midnight			2
right now , i ’m thinking the final is what we call a ‘ pick ’ em ’			0
in other words , a 50 - 50 .			0

@entity6 has lost seven of his last eight games against @entity1
@entity1 misfired several shots against @entity16
@entity6 made a shift in his court position as his forehand has *improved*
