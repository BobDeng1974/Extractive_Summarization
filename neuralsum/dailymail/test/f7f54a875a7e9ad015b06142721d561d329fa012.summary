taken at the dawn of photography , these unique pictures are some of the first ever taken of the city of @entity5 , nearly 100 years before much of its historic centre was destroyed by @entity9 bombing			1
the images , captured between 1850 and 1855 by photographer @entity11 , have surfaced after being put up for auction - and could fetch up to £ 30,000			1
everything from the waterfront , city centre and @entity17 church can be seen in the shots , as well as @entity20 building which was pulled down in 1857			2
it became part of the site for the @entity24 before that was closed in 1999 and later turned into a block of flats			0
many of the buildings pictured have changed dramatically between the 19th century and today , particularly the area of @entity31			0
other shots are almost identical , including the one of @entity33 at the @entity34 , which shows that little is different in certain areas that escaped the heavy bombing during the @entity38			0
the albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s			0
they are due to go up for auction in @entity44 tomorrow			1
stepping back in time : the @entity20 ( pictured left ) can be seen in a photo believed to have been taken shortly before it was knocked down			0
it was replaced by @entity48 , which has since closed and been converted into flats			0
as it is today ( right ) many uses : there was a builder , undertaker and joiner stationed at @entity5 when this photo was taken between 1850 and 1855 how @entity5 looks now			2
it has become restaurants but retained some of its old character for people to enjoy while they eat little difference : the view through @entity33 at the @entity34 has not changed much between 1850 and today - apart from the road works @entity31 in @entity5 ( left in 1850 ) is one of the areas where the buildings have changed quite dramatically over the past 160 years			1
the structure was overhauled in 1962 to make way for what is the former @entity72 building			0
today it stands defunct and boarded up ( right ) this fascinating picture shows @entity75 in @entity5 at the dawn of photography , believed to have been taken between 1850 and 1855 @entity17 church was constructed from the 12th to the 15th centuries and has been a place of @entity82 worship for over 900 years			1
pictured left is what the towering structure looked like in the 19th century after being snapped by @entity11 and , right , how it appears now @entity11 's photograph shows @entity87 , which was destroyed in the @entity88 in 1940			1
built as a merchant 's house , it had been a showcase of jacobean architecture before it was bombed not much change : the church is renowned for the beauty of its gothic architecture and is classed as a grade i listed building by @entity100			2
queen elizabeth i is said to have described it as ' the fairest , goodliest , and most famous parish church in @entity104 ' @entity105 - port street in @entity5			2
the albumen prints were made in the 1870s from the original paper negatives of the early 1850s area of beauty : @entity111 , @entity5 , as it looked in the 19th century			2
a replica of the @entity113 had been erected there , in the shadow of the cathedral , because the original was deemed too fragile to move again missing landmark : the remains of the replica cross can now be seen in nearby @entity120 , where they were transferred in about 1950 from @entity111 ( pictured )			0
much of the trees which shielded the cathedral are now gone another image of @entity75 in @entity5			0
it is believed the set of pictures could fetch up to £ 30,000 when they go up for auction tomorrow this photo shows host street in @entity5			1
it provides a glimpse into the past as much of the historic city centre was destroyed by bombing during the @entity38			1
