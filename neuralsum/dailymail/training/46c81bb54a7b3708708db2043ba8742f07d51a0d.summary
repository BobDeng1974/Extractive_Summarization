ambushed : @entity0 in white tie last night @entity0 and @entity2 narrowly avoided humiliation over the @entity4 last night amid scenes of chaos , confusion and recrimination in the @entity9			0
speaker @entity10 prompted uproar as he attacked the government for denying mps a specific vote on the controversial measure – with @entity16 accusing their leadership of ‘ tyranny ’ , ‘ deception ’ and ‘ chicanery ’			1
in extraordinary remarks for a speaker , mr @entity10 accused ministers of breaking their promises for a full debate and vote on the warrant in a ‘ sorry saga ’ that would leave the public ‘ contemptuous ’			1
mr @entity0 came within nine votes of losing the support of the @entity9 after @entity30 mounted an ambush to try to halt proceedings			2
but after the attempt was narrowly outvoted , the government went on to win a separate , key vote on a package of @entity39 crime and justice measures by a large margin , by 464 to 38			1
despite trying to derail proceedings , @entity30 backed the government when it came to the substance of the issue – ensuring a large majority			0
however , the earlier manoeuvre meant the prime minister was forced to rush back from his annual speech at the @entity49 in @entity50 – dressed in the traditional white tie worn at the occasion – to take part in the vote			1
the victory came at a high price , with @entity16 bitterly accusing ministers and the @entity59 ’ office , in charge of party discipline , of ‘ disgraceful ’ tactics			0
ministers , meanwhile , were furious with mr @entity10 for triggering what they saw as an contrived furore			2
one senior conservative said : ‘ @entity67 has completely lost the plot			0
’ mr @entity0 had promised to give mps a vote on the warrant before a crucial by - election in @entity73 and @entity74			2
but , fearing a damaging rebellion , @entity76 ’s whips ’ office yesterday put forward a motion which excluded the warrant – which is by far the most controversial of the 35 @entity39 measures the government wants to opt back into			1
instead , 11 more obscure powers were included on the @entity9 order paper			0
but fury erupted when mr @entity10 declared at the start of the debate that , in fact , no vote on the arrest warrant was taking place – denying mps a say			1
in a vicious attack , the speaker told @entity89 : ‘ this has been a rather sorry saga and the @entity95 should not be put in this position			2
home secretary @entity2 warned rebel colleagues not to oppose @entity99 membership of the @entity4 ( @entity100 ) which allows police to extradite suspects quickly between @entity39 states ‘ i think most of us think a commitment made is a commitment that should be honoured and we should try to operate according to sensible standards rather than trying to slip things through some sort of artifice			1
‘ it may be the sort of thing that some people think is very clever but people outside of the @entity95 expect straightforward dealing and they are frankly contemptuous , and i use the word advisedly , contemptuous of what is not straight dealing			0
’ @entity121 @entity120 sir @entity119 said the vote was a ‘ travesty of our parliamentary proceedings ’			0
‘ it is tainted with chicanery , it is not the way this @entity130 should be treated , ’ he said			0
@entity131 , another @entity120 rightwinger , said the ‘ outrageous abuse of parliamentary procedures ’ meant the government was taking ‘ the way of tyranny ’			0
backbench @entity120 sir @entity137 accused the government of ‘ sly ’ behaviour , while former shadow home secretary @entity140 said it had been the most disorderly debate he had seen in 20 years			1
@entity30 ’s shadow home secretary @entity143 said : ‘ despite being promised this vote , the @entity9 has been denied the chance to give overwhelming backing to this crucial crime - fighting measure			1
‘ @entity2 was very foolish not to listen to the strong support across the @entity95 both for the @entity4 and for the opportunity of a comprehensive vote			0
speaker @entity10 prompted uproar as he attacked the government for denying mps a specific vote on the controversial measure ‘ she has handled this dreadfully			1
it ’s a complete mess			0
’ the wounds suffered by the @entity16 last night will be seen by many as self - inflicted , since the @entity4 is backed by @entity30 and the @entity160 and would have passed with ease – even with a sizeable @entity120 rebellion			0
at one stage , it was anticipated as many as 100 mps might vote against			0
even after yesterday ’s farcical scenes , only 38 objected to the package			2
the dispute comes after mrs may decided two years ago to opt out of all 133 @entity39 police and criminal justice measures			1
ministers then had until december 1 this year to decide which they wanted to opt back into			1
following @entity175 negotiations , it was decided to re-join 35 – including the @entity4			0
the @entity4 has been in force in @entity99 since 2004 but , had ministers opted not to re-join , it was due to lapse in less than three weeks			2
it was created to ensure a warrant issued by a judge in one @entity39 country could be enforced in another and is designed to speed up extradition proceedings			2
but critics say it has been used to pursue @entity99 for relatively minor offences and object to the whole concept of a @entity190 - wide system of justice .			1
