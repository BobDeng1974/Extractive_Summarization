she then moved on to the @entity19 and has been living on the 1,070 - passenger ship for almost seven years			1
@entity29 was killed in action on @entity31 in 1944 and mr @entity6 was one of his @entity33 dog handlers since setting saii , mrs @entity34 has completed more than 200 cruises - including 15 round - the - world trips - taking in more than 100 countries			1
some of the ship 's 655 crew members took to calling her @entity22 and the nickname has stuck			1
' nobody can pronounce my last name anyway , so it 's fine with me , ' she told the @entity46			0
mrs @entity34 rarely goes ashore but does keep in touch with her family via computer , visiting them when the ship docks in @entity52			1
she misses her three sons and seven grandchildren , but says ' they have families of their own and do what 's right for them '			0
' the day before my husband died of cancer in 1997 , he told me , " do n't stop cruising			1
" ' so here i am today living a stress - free , fairy - tale life , ' the widow told the @entity63 ' i enjoy dancing , and this was the best of the remaining ships that still use dance hosts			0
' my husband did n't dance , just did n't like to , and encouraged me to dance with the hosts			0
' i dance every night for a couple hours after dinner			0
' mrs @entity34 ( above ) picked the @entity19 because she likes dancing and it ' was the best of the remaining ships that still use dance hosts ' the @entity19 can carry up to 1,070 passengers and has a crew of 655			1
it 's been cruising for 11 years her husband , @entity27 , was n't a dancer , but he was a fighter			0

the week before his death , mr @entity6 attended the @entity89 in @entity90 even though his doctor told him he might not back it back			0
the life - long @entity1 resident was an @entity94 , coached @entity95 for many years and liked nothing more than taking cruises and being ' @entity98 ' , according to the @entity99			0

in addition to spending time dancing and taking part in other scheduled activities , mrs @entity34 devotes some of her hours to doing needlepoint work in the ship 's @entity128 lounge			2
she 's been doing needlepoint about as long as she 's been cruising and gives everything she makes to the @entity19 's crew because it gives her ' great pleasure ' and they are ' almost like family now '			2
do n't expect to see miss @entity34 back on land to celebrate her 87th birthday in may - or any other subsequent birthday for that matter			1
she says she is n't sure if she would ever ' be able to readjust to the real world again ' because she 's spoiled and that the ' crew members bend over backwards ' to keep her happy			2
however , if the @entity19 is docking in @entity143 on the big day , the birthday girl might not be able to resist going ashore			2
she finds the ' gorgeously glitzy ' outfits at the @entity147 irresistible - especially because they are well - suited for ballroom dancing .			0
