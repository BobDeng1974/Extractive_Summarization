by @entity0 published : 04:36 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 07:18 est , 18 april 2013 the business of cleaning up the trail of space junk left by more than 60 years of space exploration has long baffled scientists			1
now @entity7 space experts think they may have the answer - a space harpoon			2
next week , at a @entity13 conference in @entity14 , @entity15 , experts from across the globe will discuss the state of our skies and the growing threat posed by space debris			2
@entity7 space experts think they may have the answer to clearing up the trail of space junk - a space harpoon			1
a ' chase ' satellite would be fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target using laser and radar guidance systems , a piece of space junk would be targeted , and then captured with a gas - propelled harpoon on a tether once the space junk is secured , a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the @entity40 's atmosphere @entity42 's plans would see a ' chase ' satellite fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target			1
using laser and radar guidance systems , a piece of space junk would be targeted , and then captured with a gas - propelled harpoon on a tether			1
once the space junk is secured , a smaller sub-satellite detaches from the chase satellite and pulls the junk downwards to burn up as it re-enters the @entity40 's atmosphere			1
then the chase satellite would then search out another target but @entity7 already has a unique answer			0
dr @entity58 , from @entity59 , told the @entity60 : ' we 've built a harpoon ' it comes as the @entity65 based company announces it has been awarded a study contract by the @entity68 space agency @entity67 to tackle the problem of space junk			2
the study , awarded as part of the @entity74 ( @entity75 ) programme , will focus on the removal of large pieces of space debris between now and 2020			0
the @entity40 is surrounded by an ever - growing cloud of space junk , which @entity81 has estimated contains 500,000 objects bigger than a marble , and 22,000 bigger than a cricket ball			1
space has become a critical part of our infrastructure - from weather forecasting and @entity40 observation , to gps and telecommunications			2
it is feared that space junk could pose a very real threat to these vital services			2
@entity42 's plans would see a ' chase ' satellite fitted with five or more harpoons which can fire at a moving target			0

experts hope the system could remove around five pieces of space debris a year			0
the first space tests of this harpoon are scheduled within the next three years			0
since the first object , @entity136 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			0
the @entity40 is surrounded by an ever - growing cloud of space junk , which @entity81 has estimated contains 500,000 objects bigger than a marble , and 22,000 bigger than a cricket ball			1
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
it is estimated that there are 500,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity40 's orbit			1
if they are successful a working device could follow before 2020			0
' through this latest study , @entity42 will pave the way to solving a major issue for all space users , ' said @entity163 ceo @entity162			0
recent studies by the @entity13 and @entity81 have shown that the amount of space debris , particularly in low Â­ - @entity40 orbit , could cause ' collision cascading ' also known as the @entity170 effect , which would hamper all space activity for 50 years			2
these studies also point out that the effect can be stabilised by removing , between now and 2020 , between five and 10 items of large space debris			0
' in mobilising our industrial resources in conjunction with those of national agencies , we will put forward innovative solutions and technologies capable of dealing with space debris and thereby ensuring the sustainable development of space , ' mr @entity162 said			0
@entity15 's space agency @entity183 is experimenting with a projectile net that can envelope a piece of space junk before pulling it out of orbit and a ' litter - picker ' that grabs debris with a robot arm and pulls it back to @entity40			1

@entity40 is surrounded by an ever - growing cloud of space junk
it poses a threat to space infrastructure , such as satellites
@entity7 scientists propose a ' harpoon ' to pull junk out of orbit
