by @entity0 follow @ @ charlieskillen football fans are once again bearing the brunt of changes to the @entity5 fixture schedule by @entity6 and @entity7			2
the tv duo released changes to kick - off times for every weekend up until the end of november on monday , leaving many travelling supporters frustrated			2
a large minority of the changes leave it impossible for fans of the away side travelling on the train to either get to the host town or city in time for an early kick - off , or get home after an evening game			0
loyal : @entity26 fans will have to find an alternative way to get home from their game at @entity30 in september away days : @entity32 fans are among those inconvenienced difficulties : train travel is impossible for the fans hard work : fans will need to make alternate arrangements august @entity40 17 : @entity43 v @entity41 ( 1.30pm ) mon 18 : @entity44 v @entity32 ( 8pm ) sat 23 : @entity45 v @entity26 ( 12.45pm ) sat 23 : @entity47 v @entity46 ( 5.30pm ) sat 30 : @entity47 v @entity32 ( 5.30pm ) september mon 15 : @entity50 v @entity48 ( 8pm ) mon 29 : @entity30 v @entity26 ( 8pm ) october sat 25 : @entity52 v @entity51 ( 5.30pm ) november mon 03 : @entity54 v @entity53 ( 8pm ) mon 24 : @entity45 v @entity41 ( 8pm ) sat 29 : @entity53 v @entity32 ( 5.30pm ) the opening round of fixtures sees @entity32 travel up to @entity44 for the monday night 8pm kick - off – with travelling fans unable to get home the same night			1
@entity41 fans will also struggle to see @entity63 ’s first game managing their side in the @entity5 , with the earliest train from the south coast making it into @entity67 just minutes before kick - off at @entity69 on sunday august 17			2
monday night matches are the worst culprits in the revised list , with five of the seven announced fixtures leaving train - travelling fans stranded in the host city , including @entity50 vs @entity48 on september 15 and @entity54 vs @entity53 on november 3			1
august is the worst month for travelling supporters , with five games leaving away fans needing other arrangements , including @entity81 - based supporters of @entity46 and @entity32 playing at @entity47 in the saturday 5.30 kick - off on consecutive weekends			1
difficulties : @entity32 fans will face travel difficulties for games at @entity44 , @entity47 and @entity53 the last train from @entity89 to the capital leaves mid-way through the second half of those fixtures			1
@entity32 ’s travelling contingent have it worst with three of their matches being late kick - offs at @entity44 , @entity47 and @entity53 , while @entity41 and @entity26 fans will be struggling for two games			1
last season the @entity5 allocated £ 250,000 to every club to put towards an away fan initiative to help ease these problems			0
clubs like @entity30 and @entity102 put on free coach travel for fans , while @entity32 chartered special trains for night games at the two @entity108 clubs			1
a host of other clubs such as @entity43 used the money to subsidise ticket costs			0
new boss : @entity41 fans wishing to catch @entity63 's debut will not be able to take the train celebrations : but @entity46 fans might find their route home from @entity47 blocked by problems with trains a spokesperson for the @entity135 ’ @entity136 said : ‘ match - going fans come too far down the list of priorities when matches are selected for tv			1
every season there are examples of games being moved to times which are extremely difficult for travelling fans			0
‘ to pick an example at random on the season ’s opening weekend , how are @entity41 fans going to get to @entity43 for a game on sunday at 1.30pm ? ‘ tv companies often get the blame but let ’s not forget that it ’s the clubs themselves who allow this to happen by agreeing to contractual terms which inconvenience their own fans			1
‘ that ’s not to say @entity7 and @entity6 could n’t lighten the load on fans			0
the @entity136 has received many complaints from fans unhappy at the four weeks it took both companies to announce which games would be moved for broadcast			0
‘ every day of silence from them cost fans time and money			0
train fares go up , hotel rooms are sold out , and it ’s more of a struggle to book days off work			0
supporters want to see both @entity7 and @entity6 move a lot quicker next season			0
’ complaint : the @entity136 say @entity6 and @entity7 could lighten the load on fans sunny outlook : @entity45 fans are also trying to find a way around the lack of trains for one of their away matches			2

tv *providers* made changes to the fixture list on monday
changes came out just *33* days before the start of the season
fans are made to find alternative travel with trains not an option
@entity32 fans face three trips in first three months where they either can not get there or back by train on the same day
@entity41 supporters have a struggle to reach games away at @entity43 and @entity45
@entity46 , @entity45 , @entity48 , @entity26 , @entity51 and @entity53 fans all suffer the *effects* too
