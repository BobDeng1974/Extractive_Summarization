apology : @entity1 says he never had the chance to say sorry over the @entity4 disaster the police chief on duty during the @entity4 disaster today said that he had never previously apologised for lying to officials because he had ' never found an opportunity ' to do so			1
@entity1 told the inquest into the deaths of 96 @entity13 fans during the @entity14 semi-final in april 1989 that he had not spoken out because was worried about being misrepresented			1
the former officer also admitted he was ' possibly in denial ' over his misleading statement that a gate had been forced open by fans , leading to a deadly crush on the terraces of the @entity24 stadium			2
he told the jury he was a @entity26 at the time of the accident , but said he hoped that was not a factor in his promotion to the position of chief superintendent			1
and he denied taking part in a ' cover - up ' designed to divert blame from the police by ascribing the disaster to @entity13 fans ' bad behaviour			1
yesterday , mr @entity1 said he ' apologised unreservedly ' to the families of the victims who were killed in the opening minutes of the game between @entity13 and @entity44			1
shortly before kick - off the officer - who had never previously overseen a major football match - ordered a gate to be opened in order to ease overcrowding outside the ground , but this allowed fans to rush into to already packed terraces			1
when fans started dying , mr @entity1 told @entity55 officials that ' some fans have got in through a gate ' , which he now admits was a ' terrible lie '			1
@entity59 , lawyer for the victims ' families , asked him why it took him 26 years to ' come clean ' over his ' critical mistakes '			0
mr @entity1 , 70 , replied : ' i was possibly in denial and i never found a venue or an opportunity where i could meet with someone and speak to them honestly and openly and ensure that my thought and my feelings would be reported fairly			1
' yesterday this court gave me the opportunity to sit here and apologise fully for the first time without fear of anybody misrepresenting what i was saying			2
' crush : 96 @entity13 fans were killed by being pushed up against barriers on the overcrowded terrace he denied saying anything inaccurate to @entity55 officials @entity85 and @entity86 , but confessed he had told a ' lie by omission ' for failing to mention that he gave the order to open the gate , and added that it was his family who told him what he had done			1
he said : ' i have spoken to my family , who are genuine people , and i have said i am troubled by this situation and they said to me , " well you obviously lied because you did n't tell the whole truth			2
" ' mr @entity1 , who was promoted to be an area commander at @entity102 two weeks before the semi-final , told the jury that he was not a ' reasonably competent match commander ' due to his lack of experience			1
asked if he was a member of the @entity108 at the time of the disaster , mr @entity1 said , ' i was , ' adding that he had joined the organisation in 1975 and was made @entity112 of his local lodge in 1990			1
he said he did not know whether the chief constable of his force or other senior officers were in the @entity117 because it was not seen as ' acceptable ' to be a senior policeman and a @entity26			2
mr @entity120 asked if mr @entity1 's promotion to chief superintendent in march 1989 was anything to do with his membership of the @entity117			2
he replied : ' i would not know but i would hope not			0
nobody ever spoke to me about it			0
' at one point mr @entity120 put it to mr @entity1 that there had been a ' false narrative ' after the disaster which sought to blame @entity13 fans for what had happened and conceal the truth about police failings			1
after pausing to consider his answer , mr @entity1 replied : ' i disagree			0
there was no conspiracy as far as i am concerned			0
' rejecting claims that he suspected there were fatalities by the time he spoke to mr @entity85 , mr @entity1 added : ' i do n't think i was involved in any cover - up whatsoever			1
' my main objective was a rescue operation and to do the very best i could for all concerned			0
it was chaotic , hectic , stressful			0
' chaos : fans flooded onto the pitch in the aftermath of the disaster after claiming that no one in the court room would understand the position he found himself in , mr @entity1 was asked why he had concealed the truth from mr @entity85			1
' sir , i said yesterday , i do n't know , ' mr @entity1 responded			1
mr @entity120 then said to the former officer : ' that 's not the way that a competent match commander behaves , is it mr @entity1 , lying to the chief executive of the @entity55 when people are dying on the pitch feet away ? ' mr @entity1 answered : ' sir , under normal circumstances , as i have said , outside in the street or in an office , it is not the normal way you would expect			2
' but we are not talking about normal circumstances , we are talking about a massive tragedy and me doing my best under very difficult circumstances			0
' asked if he had always been consistent in his account of what he said in the control box , the former chief superintendent said : ' it may be that my recollections over 26 years , or what i have said about mr @entity85 , may vary , and , dare i say it , understandably			0
' mr @entity120 later asked : ' your negligence caused disaster and the deaths of 96 @entity13 fans , did n't it ? ' mr @entity1 replied : ' i would not use the word negligence			1
sir , i did not foresee the consequence			0
' mr @entity120 said that the former officer 's failure to close the tunnel before opening the gates was a , ' blunder of the first magnitude			0
' mr @entity1 said , ' i ca n't deny it , ' adding : ' i 'm not making excuses , i have nothing to cover up , i have put my hands up and admitted my failings and i will continue to do so			2
' the officer told jurors he ' came clean ' about giving the order to open the gate at about 4pm after returning to the control box from a visit to @entity4 's boardroom			0
whilst in the boardroom - in the presence of directors from @entity214 , @entity44 and @entity13 - mr @entity1 again failed to mention that he had authorised the gate to be opened			1
after leaving the ground and travelling to @entity216 on the evening of april 15 , mr @entity1 said he was summoned to brief chief constable @entity217			0
mr @entity120 asked mr @entity1 how the chief constable had reacted when he was informed that the head of the @entity55 had been lied to			2
mr @entity1 said : ' sir , i think the best answer to that is that he was very unhappy overall			0
i remember walking into his office			0
' he was sat behind his desk and he was n't best pleased about the events			0
i just remember having related my story to him and being dismissed like a schoolboy out of the headmaster 's office			0
' asked about the testimony he gave to the initial @entity231 into the disaster , a few months after the match , mr @entity1 said he ' should not have been giving evidence ' because he was traumatised			2
he also suggested that post-traumatic stress disorder had affected his memory of events			0
