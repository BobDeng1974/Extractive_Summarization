i 've been lucky enough to have travelled quite a lot in the @entity2 , thanks to stints as a reporter for various tv holiday shows , including @entity7 ... ? and @entity8			1
on one of my first reporting trips , i flew to @entity11 and sailed through the islands on an 80ft monohull boat			0
there 's something magical about the @entity2 : being in a boat , pootling around and getting from one island to the next gives you a real sense of adventure			1
in peak condition : @entity22 finds her feet during a stay at the sophisticated @entity26 resort in @entity27 but now that i have a baby son , @entity28 , my adventuring days are over for a while			1
and for my latest holiday i was looking for relaxation			1
so in @entity27 , we stayed first at the @entity34 , a lovely resort with a very friendly atmosphere			1
its great facilities made it perfect for a family break			0
just glorious : @entity40 sits on the south - west shore of @entity27 , within sight of the famous pitons then we visited the @entity44 , which is situated in a @entity45 overlooking the island 's famous peaks , the @entity48			1
some of the @entity50 's rooms are completely open to the elements			0
you can feel the wind moving through the rooms in the evening			0
simply sensational : the second part of @entity22 's holiday took her to the remote enclave of @entity58 you sleep in a very comfortable four - poster with a mosquito net - it 's impossibly glamorous camping			1
and in the morning , you wake up to that extraordinary view			0
after @entity27 we headed to @entity58 , a new private island resort a mile off @entity66 , the largest of the @entity67			1
one of our highlights was a day - trip sail to @entity71 , an eco-resort famous for its scuba - diving			0
a home from home : @entity22 found high luxury on @entity58 - perfect for her first holiday with @entity77 it brought home to me just what variety you can enjoy in the @entity2			1
on @entity27 , there is so much to do			2
if you want to hike , you can hike up the volcanoes ; if you want watersports , you can enjoy all sorts			0
a week on @entity58 , however , is all about staying put and enjoying the quiet			2
it was just wonderful being surrounded by that beautiful sea and taking in those views			0
i 'd become convinced in recent years that the @entity92 is the smart place to go these days			0
i 'd forgotten the unique charm of the @entity2 experience			2
it just has a special allure and i think it always will have			0
