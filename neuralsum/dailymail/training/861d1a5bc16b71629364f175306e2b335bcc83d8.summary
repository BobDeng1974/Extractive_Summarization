but one couple have spoken of their shock after noticing the scan of their unborn baby looked like - @entity9			1
@entity10 , 39 , and wife @entity11 , 36 , - who are ' totally anti-tory ' - returned home from their 27 - week scan and immediately posted the image on @entity16			1
@entity18 tot : a couple from @entity20 claim they can see an image of @entity9 in an ultrasound scan of their unborn child ... now you come to mention it : @entity28 with trademark bouffant and pearls just hours later a friend pointed out the outline of the @entity28 floating over the top of the baby ’s body			1
the couple , from @entity37 , @entity20 , said the image looks ' just like @entity40 ’s character from spitting image '			1
bizarrely , they also claim they can make out the faces of @entity40 ’s former rivals , @entity47 leader @entity46 and @entity49 leader @entity48			1
the images all appear in a line in the shadows cast by the ultrasound above the baby , with the outline of @entity9 in the middle			2
father of six mr @entity10 said : ' it is such a strange thing too see			2
we had not noticed it at first we were too busy looking at the baby			2
' but we put it on @entity16 over the weekend and someone just spotted that it looked a bit like @entity9			2
' its amazing how much it looks like her			0
it ’s really uncanny but it was a bit of shock - we are not @entity18 at all			0
it looks like a scene from @entity74			0
' despite the likeness , the couple have no intention of naming their child @entity78 or @entity40 after the former prime minister			1
@entity81 husband mr @entity10 added : ' we are definitely not naming our child after any of them			0
we think it might be a girl , but we ’re totally anti-tory so she wo n’t be a @entity40			0
' instead the @entity87 intend to call their child @entity88 if it is a girl , or @entity91 if it is a boy			0
@entity9 became @entity94 ’s first female prime minister when she was elected in 1979 and ran the country for 11 years before stepping down in 1990			0
she received he title of @entity9 in 1992 when she was raised to a peerage and turns 87 this year			0
shocked : expectant parents @entity10 and @entity99 put the scan on @entity16 where a friend pointed out the uncanny likeness dubious : the @entity87 also claim they can see ex-labour leader @entity46 , left , and former @entity103 leader @entity48 , right , just next to the vision of @entity9 in the scan below gaggle of mps : the supposed image of @entity46 is circled left , @entity108 circled right and @entity40 circled centre			1

couple also claim they can see former @entity103 leader @entity48 and @entity115 leader @entity46 in scan
