popular diets such as @entity2 or @entity3 can help people lose weight quickly but in the long term may be no more effective than living healthily , a study claims			1
people on fad diets often lose weight in the short term , but they regain their lost pounds within two years and may be just as well off using traditional weight loss techniques , the researchers say			1
the advice comes amid an obesity crisis , with one adult in every four in @entity15 obese and three in 10 children between two and 15 overweight or obese			0
they compared them with what they dubbed ' usual care ' , which refers to traditional methods to promote weight loss such as low - fat diets , behavioural weight loss intervention , nutritional counselling , or self - help materials			1
in trials comparing @entity3 to usual care , @entity3 dieters lost an average 7.7 to 13.2 pounds after a year compared to 1.8 to 11.9 pounds with usual care			2
however , after two years the weight lost was partially regained			0
in the only trial comparing the @entity29 diet to usual care , no difference in weight loss occurred in 12 months , however the participants in this study were both severely obese and had undergone gastric bypass surgery			1
there are millions of people in @entity62 who are n't getting sufficient calories , protein , vitamins and minerals			0
doctors say our growing reliance on fast food , coupled with soaring rates of binge - drinking , means many are lacking the vitamins and minerals essential for health			0
the result , in the most extreme cases , is pot - bellies , wasted limbs and emaciated bodies - all conditions more usually associated with famine victims in the developing world			2
while malnutrition can be fatal , in more mild forms it can cause a host of symptoms that impact on every day life , from hair loss and muscle wastage to food cravings and lethargy			0
results from trials on the @entity2 diet were inconsistent			0
trials involving head - to - head comparisons between @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity33 and usual care suggest that all four result in a modest weight loss at one year , as did those in the control group who received the usual care			1
those on the @entity2 diet lost an average 4.6 to 10.3lbs ; @entity3 participants lost an average 6.6lbs ; zone dieters lost an average 3.5 to 7lbs ; and control lost about 4.85lbs			2
in studies involving head - to - head comparisons , there were no marked differences between @entity2 , @entity3 , and @entity33 diets at improving cholesterol , blood pressure , blood sugar levels , or other cardiovascular risk factors			1
the longest diet studies researchers analysed lasted for two years , and results were only available for the @entity2 or @entity3 diets			1
those studies found dieters regained some of their weight over time			0
choose one : trials involving head - to - head comparisons between @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity33 and usual care suggest that all four result in a modest weight loss at one year , as did those in the control group senior author dr @entity137 , professor of medicine at @entity140 / @entity139 in @entity141 , said : ' despite their popularity and important contributions to the multi-million dollar weight loss industry , we still do not know if these diets are effective to help people lose weight and decrease their risk factors for heart disease			1
' with such a small number of trials looking at each diet and their somewhat conflicting results , there is only modest evidence that using these diets is beneficial in the long - term			2
' dr @entity137 said to better understand the potential benefits from any one or all of these diets , researchers need to conduct large clinical trials directly comparing all four popular diets for long - term weight loss and changes in other heart disease risk factors			1
he added : ' a broader lifestyle intervention , which also involves doctors and other health professionals , may be more effective			0
' this also tells doctors that popular diets on their own may not be the solution to help their patients lose weight			0
' the findings were published in the journal @entity179 : @entity180 and @entity181 .			0

@entity2 , @entity3 , @entity29 and @entity33 diets all examined
all four were found to result in modest weight loss after one year
none were found to be more effective than traditional weight - loss methods
