by @entity0 published : 04:28 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 19:54 est , 13 september 2012 a man with @entity3 ’s syndrome is to sue an @entity5 hospital after a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order was allegedly put on his file without his family ’s knowledge			1
a note on the 51 - year - old ’s medical record said he should not be revived if he had a heart attack or stopped breathing , apparently on the basis of his disability			0
his family said they were not told about the @entity20 order , despite visiting him almost daily during his three - week stay at the hospital			1
the 51 - year - old was admitted to the queen elizabeth the queen @entity23 in @entity25 , @entity26 and allegedly had a @entity20 order put on his file without his family 's knowledge horrified relatives only learned about the instruction when one of the man ’s carers found it folded up in his bag after he was discharged			1
they say his treatment was ‘ degrading and disgraceful ’ and have started a legal action on his behalf against the queen elizabeth the queen @entity23 in @entity25 , @entity26			1
lawyers for the man , identified only as @entity41 , said the decision to withhold life - saving treatment on the basis of his learning difficulties was ‘ nothing short of blatant prejudice ’			1
the @entity20 allegedly reveals doctors did not discuss the order with @entity41 because he did not have the mental capacity			1
no information was given to his family because they were said to be unavailable , even though they visited him almost every day and his parents had meetings with his doctors			0
lawyers for the family said the order gave the reasons for the decision as ‘ @entity3 ’ , ‘ learning difficulties ’ , and because @entity41 was ‘ bed - bound ’ and ‘ unable to swallow ’			2
response : the hospital trust says that it was following proper procedures the form also allegedly said the @entity20 order should remain indefinitely , without any planned review			1
a close relative said : ‘ it is just not acceptable , not being consulted on whether someone lives or dies			0
’ @entity41 , who also has dementia , lived with his parents until late 2010 , when he went into residential care			2
in august 2011 he was admitted to hospital to have a feeding tube fitted to his stomach , and returned a month later over problems with it			0
when he left three weeks later , a carer at his residential home found the @entity20 order			2
the man ’s relative , who can not be identified , said @entity41 was not aware of the case , adding : ‘ we were all shocked to find out what had been put into @entity41 ’s notes without our knowledge			1
‘ one member of the family at least was in the hospital practically every day and could have been consulted			0
‘ we are bringing this action to highlight the issue and to make sure that something like this can not happen to another loved son and brother			0
’ @entity41 ’s lawyer , @entity104 , said : ‘ to use @entity3 ’s syndrome and learning difficulties as a reason to withhold life - saving treatment is nothing short of blatant prejudice			2
‘ if an individual was physically preventing a doctor from administering life - saving treatment to a disabled relative , it would be a matter for the police , yet we see doctors taking this decision without consent regularly			0
’ @entity121 would not comment on the case			0
but medical director dr @entity123 said it complied with the @entity127 charity ’s charter on helping people with learning disabilities , and had ‘ clear , robust ’ resuscitation policies that met professional guidelines .			0

staff at the queen elizabeth the queen @entity23 in @entity25 , @entity26 , allegedly had the @entity20 in place
the man , referred to as @entity41 , would not have been resuscitated if he suffered heart or *respiratory* arrest
the main reason for this was because he was disabled , *paperwork* said
hospital trust says they were following *correct* procedures
