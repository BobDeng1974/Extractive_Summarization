some players arrive like a whirlwind and then ca n’t follow it up in the second season			2
@entity4 took a season to bed in , but is now ready to make his impact			1
i first saw him play for @entity9 against @entity10 ; he ’s an allrounder			0
@entity12 , athletic , bright around the ball			0
he will go past a defender and he can score goals			0
not playing at the @entity16 has helped him			0
@entity18 man : @entity19 scores his first of two goals as he explodes into life this season for @entity24 improved : @entity4 had a tough first season marred by injury , but he has all the attributes to succeed in @entity10 @entity4 's stunner : how @entity4 scored his superb second goal against @entity30 already a trip to @entity32 in august is looking a key game for @entity30			1
that ’s where they go next and they need to get a result			0
they ca n’t afford to let @entity24 and @entity40 get too far away			1
a £ 45million star with a £ 16million fee you have got to admire the confidence of @entity45			1
@entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 could n’t turn @entity49 , but the @entity30 manager believes he can			1
i ’m going through the full circle of emotions on this : people say he is a cheap buy for £ 16m when you think @entity58 cost @entity59 £ 12m , but he ’s only cheap if he succeeds			1
watching on : @entity30 missed a striker of @entity49 's class tonight , but his behaviour will have to be managed @entity63 have dumped him a for a reason			1
his attitude sucks and @entity30 have built their progress on teamwork			0
on talent alone , he ’s a £ 45m player			0
it certainly wo n’t be quiet with him around			0
it 's not all about @entity40 it must be a nightmare for a defender			0
you are given a chasing by @entity76 and @entity4 ... and then on comes @entity77			1
the little magician now has two goals in two games from the bench			0
last night , @entity24 had @entity77 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 on the bench			1
i wonder if too many people have been too quick to hand @entity40 the title this season			2
@entity90 : @entity77 ends the game as a contest just 23 seconds after coming on as a substitute the bench boys : @entity77 was one of a host of stars on the @entity24 bench and his impact was instant you just have to adore @entity102 when we talk about the foundation of the modern @entity24 , it is easy to focus on the mighty @entity106			1
but @entity102 is a warrior too			2
when they lifted the title last season , he got the biggest cheer and the supporters adore his appetite and passion			2
passion : @entity24 have been built around @entity106 and @entity102 , who the fans love signed by @entity116 for around £ 6m , he has been a brilliant capture			1
if you have a child who wants to be a footballer , get him to watch @entity102			2
he does n’t play thinking about what car he ’s going to buy			0
he plays to win .			0

@entity4 has hit the ground running this year
@entity49 could be a *problem* , but he is very cheap at £ 16million
@entity24 show that they are real title *contenders* this season
@entity102 's will to win makes him a real asset for @entity24
