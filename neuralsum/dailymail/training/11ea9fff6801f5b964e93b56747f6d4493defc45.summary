@entity0 recovered from having his spine brutally re-arranged at @entity2 to ignite @entity4 ’s title defence with a sensational hat - trick			1
the @entity7 wing appeared in danger of being forced out of this fiery @entity10 opener after just five minutes , when he was smashed in the back , off the ball , by @entity15 lock @entity14			1
but he eventually shook off the damaging effects of the dubious hit to score two tries before the break and wrap up his treble in the 50th minute to send @entity23 ’s side on their way to an emphatic victory which will leave their rivals in no doubt that the champions mean business			2
impressive : @entity0 recovered from a bad tackle to score a hat - trick against @entity15 dejected : @entity15 took a hammering at in their opening @entity10 game try : @entity37 breaks clear to score @entity4 's sixth try of the night against a disappointing @entity15 @entity4 : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 ( capt ) , @entity49 , @entity50 , day , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53			1
tries : @entity43 ( 3 ) , @entity41 , @entity42 ( 2 ) , @entity55 , @entity37			1
penalties : @entity44 conversions : @entity44 ( 4 ) , @entity58 @entity15 : @entity59 ; @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 ( capt ) , may ; @entity64 , @entity65 ; @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity14 , @entity69 ; @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72			1
penalties : @entity64 , @entity65 man of the match : @entity0 referee : @entity77 attendance : 13,374			1
this was a galling occasion for @entity80 as he attempts to orchestrate a revival at @entity15 , especially when his men alarmingly unravelled in the latter stages			1
up front , the visitors were often abrasive and dogged , yet they were eclipsed by the @entity87 forwards , who drove their opponents into submission			2
@entity90 no 8 @entity53 was outstanding , as was the ring - master behind the scrum , @entity44			2
these rival clubs had approached the new season from opposite ends of the preparatory spectrum			2
for @entity4 , on the back of domestic and @entity100 success , the buzz - word was ‘ stability ’			1
@entity15 , on the other hand , had responded to abject failure in 2013 - 14 by overhauling their management and squad			1
the first points of the season went to the @entity87 ’ prolific sharp - shooter , @entity44 , but the first statement of intent came from @entity51 , who unceremoniously flattened @entity62 in the first minute			2
@entity15 ’s captain suffered worse damage later in the first half when he was blasted backwards by the rampaging @entity53			1
tussle : @entity15 's @entity116 endured a difficult evening and was on the receiving end @entity43 also dished out a robust tackle on @entity61 early on , but seconds later he was on the receiving end of @entity14 ’s smash from behind			1
@entity43 was treated and appeared to be struggling for some time afterwards , but he soon made light of the pain			0
after @entity64 briefly levelled the scores from the tee , the champions swept ahead			0
from an attacking lineout on the left , @entity50 claimed the catch and the home pack rumbled forward , drawing in defenders			0
having created space , the ball was transferred left again and @entity42 sent @entity43 over in the corner			1
@entity44 converted from an acute angle and the @entity134 10 had a major hand — or foot , to be precise — in his side ’s second try on the half - hour			2
he sent a penalty to touch on the right and after the forwards had repeated their deadly catch - and - drive routine , he chipped diagonally into the 22 , where @entity144 took the ball on the full and crashed under the posts			2
score - sheet : @entity64 scored a penalty for @entity15 , @entity65 scored the other try : @entity39 makes a break to set up a try for @entity4 centre @entity42 tackle : @entity156 scores a try for @entity4 despite last - gasp tap tackle that was a stylish strike but there was even better to come , once another @entity44 conversion had been followed by a @entity65 penalty			1
right on half - time , @entity45 broke from a lineout and @entity44 released @entity39 , whose brilliant off - load picked out @entity144 , whopassed on to @entity43 and , ignoring inside runners , he dummied and stepped outside to touch down himself			2
@entity44 ’s third conversion made it 24 - 6 at half - time			1
the procession continued in the second half			0
@entity39 was running amok from full back and the @entity172 set up a fourth try for the rampant hosts			0
after breaking from halfway , he drew the last defender and a sublime , deft pass sent @entity177 in at the left corner			0
man of the match : @entity0 goes over for one of his three tries in a hugely impressive performance @entity15 : @entity62 in action as the visitors shipped eight tries on a terrible night defence : @entity4 enjoyed the perfect start to the defence of their @entity10 title @entity191 added the extra two points and his personal tour de force went on and on			1
with an @entity196 squad due to be announced next month , this was an ideal time for the @entity87 playmaker to show peak form			0
he conjured @entity43 ’s hat - trick try with a wonderful pass ; floated high and long to the left flank where the predatory @entity203 pounced to bring the house down			1
there was no let - up in the punishment for @entity15			1
replacement scrum half @entity208 had been on the field just two minutes when he touched down on the left from another canny kick through by @entity44 and then @entity37 claimed a try on his competitive debut			1
the last word — and eighth @entity87 try — went to @entity42 , who latched on to a loose pass by @entity217 for an easy canter to the line			1
what could have been a close contest had become a massacre			0
the champions are up and running ; the rest have been warned			0
