former vice president @entity0 continued his fierce defense of the harsh interrogation techniques used by the @entity3 in the wake of the 9/11 attacks , defiantly saying that he ' would do it again in a minute			1
' speaking on @entity8 's @entity7 on sunday , @entity0 said there was ' no comparison ' between the tactics and the deaths of @entity14 citizens on september 11 , 2001 , adding that the @entity3 had ' very carefully avoided ' the practice of torture			1
' torture is what the @entity18 terrorists did to 3,000 @entity14 on 9/11			0
there is no comparison between that and what we did with respect to enhanced interrogation , ' said @entity0			2
' i have no problem as long as we achieve our objective and our objective is to get the guys who did 9/11 and it is to avoid another attack against the @entity14 , ' he said			0
his comments come in the wake of a damning @entity44 report into the @entity3 treatment of @entity18 suspects that has triggered global revulsion			0
asked whether the practice of ' rectal rehydration ' was acceptable , @entity0 acknowledged that it was not part of the interrogation program			1
but , he added , ' i believe it was done for medical reasons ' - a notion that has been questioned by medical experts			1
the former vice president also hit back against the report 's claim that president @entity60 was misled about the extent of the practices			1
' this man knew what we were doing , ' he said , outlining daily briefings that included the president , the @entity3 director and himself			2
' @entity0 acknowledged that ' rectal rehydration ' was not part of the interrogation program , but said he ' believed it was done for medical reasons ' @entity0 had previously branded the @entity44 report a ' terrible piece of work ' that is ' deeply flawed '			1
' the report 's full of cr * * , ' @entity0 told @entity81 host @entity80 on wednesday evening			2
furthermore , the @entity3 never tortured anyone under the legal definition of the word , as asserted by @entity86 lawyers at the time , he said			0
the retired politician , who said it was his job in the administration to oversee programs like the one used by the @entity3 , said the government agency 's actions were ' justified '			2
according to an anonymous @entity3 official , @entity60 was fully informed of the intelligence agency 's torture program , and had in fact authorized its use			1
former vice president @entity0 had previously branded the @entity44 report a ' terrible piece of work ' that is ' deeply flawed ' speaking to the @entity102 , the spokesman also identified a number of other senior @entity60 administration officials he claims ordered and approved the ' enhanced interrogation ' programme that led to 119 @entity18 suspects being tortured with techniques such as waterboarding			1
the official said those in the know included : @entity0 , @entity60 's legal adviser @entity0 ; national security adviser @entity113 ; @entity114 , her deputy ; attorney general @entity115 ; and several attorneys in the @entity86			1
he said that neither defense secretary @entity117 nor secretary of state @entity118 were officially informed of the @entity3 torture program			2
the former vice president said it is ' not true ' that @entity60 did n't know that aggressive interrogation techniques were being used on terrorism suspects until four years into the program			1
' read his book , ' @entity0 told @entity126			0
' he talks about it extensively in his memoirs			0
he was in fact an integral party of the program			0
he had to approve it before we went forward with it			0
' accused : @entity60 pictured alongside then vice president @entity0			1
the former @entity14 president fully authorized the brutal torture of terror suspects , @entity3 officials said today , furiously dismissing accusations that the intelligence agency 's so - called ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' took place without the knowledge according to a @entity3 spokesperson , a number of high - ranking members of the @entity60 administration were informed of the @entity3 's ' enhanced interrogation ' programme			1
these include : @entity60 - @entity150 @entity0 - vice president of the @entity14 @entity0 - @entity60 's legal advisor @entity113 - @entity153 @entity114 - @entity154 @entity115 - @entity14 attorney general several attorneys in the @entity86			1
@entity0 said @entity60 was focused on a number of other issues at the time , but ' i think that he knew everything he needed to know and wanted to know about the program , ' including the fact that prisoners were being waterboarded			1
' there no effort on our part to keep him from that ' information @entity0 said , contrary to the claims made in the @entity44 report			2
' so the notion that the committee 's trying to peddle that somehow the agency was operating on a rogue basis and we were n't being told or the president was n't being told , is just a flat out lie , ' he stated			0
what really happened , @entity0 said , is ' we asked the agency to go take steps and put in place programs that were designed to catch the ba * * * * * * who killed 3,000 of us on 9/11 , and to make sure it did n't happen again , and that 's actually what they did			0
' the former second in command said that the @entity3 operatives who ran the detention and interrogation program ' deserve a lot of credit , ' not the ' condemnation ' they are receiving from @entity196 who authorized the controversial report			1
@entity0 admitted that 9/11 mastermind @entity199 was waterboarded 183 times but he said that did not constitute torture			0
' what are we supposed to do ? kiss him on both cheeks and say , please , please tell us what you know ? ' @entity0 said			0
we did exactly what needed to be done in order to catch those who were guilty on 9/11 and to prevent a further attack , and we were successful on both parts			0
' the @entity214 vice president said that the @entity3 only used techniques on terrorism suspects that it used on its own operatives as part of their training and that includes waterboarding			1
he admitted that rectal feeding , a process the @entity3 files revealed by the @entity44 say detainees were submitted to , was not one of the 12 techniques approved by the @entity229			2
but he then said : ' what are you prepared to do to get information about future attacks on the @entity14 ? ' ' in terms of there being some problems in the program , there may have well have been ... but i do n't think the @entity44 report represents the truth of what actually happened , ' he said			0
controversy : chained detainees are seen arriving at @entity245 on @entity246 ahead of interrogation about their suspected involvement with terrorist groups including @entity18 or the @entity250 @entity0 said he had n't read the entire 6,000 - page document that the @entity44 's redacted paper was based on nor had he read the full 500 - page declassified summary released by the @entity255 yesterday			2
upon learning that one of the interrogation subjects died , @entity0 said , ' i have no sympathy for them , ' again reminding @entity80 that @entity18 killed 3,000 @entity14 on 9/11			0
he later told the @entity81 that @entity14 have to remember that @entity18 was reportedly trying to get their hands on nuclear weapons after the assault on @entity14 soil and there were anthrax attacks occurring at the time			0
' there was every reason to expect ' that there was going to be a follow - up terrorist attack , as well , he said			0
the @entity3 ' did one hell of a job , and they deserve our gratitude , ' an unapologetic @entity0 said .			2
