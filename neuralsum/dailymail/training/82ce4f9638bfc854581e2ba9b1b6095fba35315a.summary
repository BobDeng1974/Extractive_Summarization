by @entity0 published : 17:15 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 10:00 est , 22 may 2012 householders who regularly dump rubbish in their own garden will be guilty of a criminal offence and hit with a hefty fine			1
the penalty will also apply to anyone who leaves an old sofa or fridge in their garden , or has mountains of pizza boxes or takeaway cartons lying around			1
they will receive an on - the - spot fine of up to £ 100 or be taken to court – where the maximum fine would be £ 2,500			0
the new @entity18 is a key part of new anti-yob laws unveiled by @entity21 today			1
@entity21 addresses delegates at the @entity23 annual conference in @entity25 today ministers want to stop irresponsible homeowners or tenants from blighting whole streets or neighbourhoods by turning their front garden into a ‘ dumping ground ’			1
the powers will apply to privately owned homes as well as council houses			2
officials will target only those guilty of ‘ persistent , unreasonable behaviour ’			1
they will be given a warning and told to clear the rubbish away			2
if they ignore the notice , they will then be guilty of a crime			2
officials do not want to target law - abiding householders who are forced to have rubbish in their gardens at certain times of the week because of the complicated recycling policies introduced by many councils			1
and the law will be worded to protect homeowners from over-zealous council officials patrolling the streets looking to make money by issuing on - the - spot fines			2
the home secretary walks around the @entity61 's estate in @entity62 , @entity25 , with ( left to right ) inspector @entity63 of @entity64 , resident @entity65 and @entity67 @entity66 before her speech today residents have been given penalty notices for putting their rubbish out on the wrong day or for not shutting their dustbin lid properly under existing ‘ bin laws ’			1
but the new rules will apply only to repeat offenders			0
they will be given a fixed period of time to clean up their garden before any fine is issued			2
today ’s antisocial behaviour @entity82 also sounds the death knell for @entity86 ’s flagship @entity84 , which is to be scrapped			1
there will be a bonfire of @entity86 ’s anti-lout legislation – with 19 powers reduced to only six			1
the @entity18 could be issued to an individual or responsible person within a business , such as a takeaway shop			1
it will also give police – and not just town halls – the power to deal with noisy neighbours in the middle of the night			1
eyesore : ministers want to stop irresponsible homeowners or tenants from blighting whole streets or neighbourhoods by turning their front garden into a ' dumping ground ' officials say examples of where it could be used include : breach of any requirement in the notice , without reasonable excuse , would be a criminal offence , subject to a @entity117 or prosecution			1
speaking after meeting residents in @entity62 , @entity25 , she added : ' i want to see the police dealing with anti-social behaviour when it happens and when people are reporting it			1
' but victims were saying that time and time again nothing was happening , she said			0
' what we 've seen over the years is too many people having their lives blighted by anti-social behaviour			2
' the community trigger will give people , either individuals or local communities , the opportunity to say the point has come where the police are required to do something , look into it , investigate , find out what 's happening and take action			1
' she went on : ' what we will see is anti-social behaviour being taken seriously and being dealt with			2
' what we 're doing is giving people the confidence that when they call the police something will be done			1
' ministers are determined to get a grip on low - level thuggish behaviour			2
the @entity84 were routinely breached by thugs , who quickly considered having one of the orders to be a ‘ badge of honour ’			1
they were also given out in some bizarre circumstances			0
a woman who tried to kill herself four times by jumping off bridges was banned from loitering on bridges , going on to railway lines or entering multi-storey car parks unaccompanied			0
and an 88 - year - old man from @entity169 was banned from swearing or making sarcastic remarks			0
asbos will be replaced by @entity172 , which officials say will be easier and faster to impose			0
unlike the @entity84 , the injunction would not require a magistrate to be certain that the defendant had acted in an antisocial manner			1
it would instead be secured against a lower burden of proof			0
' three strikes and you 're out ' : new legislation will compel police to act on complaints against yobs , in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the tragic case of @entity190 , left , who killed herself and her disabled daughter @entity192 , right , after sustained harassment by youngsters , despite repeat appeals to the police drivers joined the war on litter louts yesterday by demanding tough punishments for those who throw rubbish from their vehicles			1
a poll by the @entity204 found that almost 90 per cent of motorists are angered by litterbugs in cars , and two - thirds want offenders to be punished with points on their licence , a large fine or even a community sentence			0
this week hundreds of @entity204 members will begin a string of litter - picks across the country , adding to the widespread support for the @entity219 ’s @entity218 for @entity221 campaign to encourage people to help clean up their communities ahead of the jubilee			0
more than 300 aa staff have volunteered to pick litter in areas including @entity228 , @entity229 and @entity230 , and the @entity204 sent out a million letters to members last weekend encouraging them to take part			0
over the next fortnight , they will conduct an hour ’s tidy - up of their neighbourhood ’s pavements , paths and parks as part of the @entity241 programme			0
the organisation has also put up a prize of £ 1,000 for the best idea for reducing rubbish on the streets			0
those who breach the orders would be deemed in contempt of court and face penalties including jail			0
it would be made available to a broader range of agencies			0
when sentenced in court , those found guilty of antisocial behaviour could also be issued with a new @entity258 , which would force prolific offenders to attend courses to change their ways			1
the @entity82 will also include a ‘ three strikes and you ’re out ’ crackdown on yobs which will compel police to act if they receive three complaints from one individual about antisocial behaviour			1
the ‘ community trigger ’ will also apply if five different households lodge the same complaint			0
the legislation is designed to prevent a repeat of the tragic case of @entity190 , who killed herself and her 18 - year - old disabled daughter @entity192 after sustained harassment by youngsters			0
she dialled 999 33 times over ten years to complain but police failed to act , classing her case as a ‘ low priority ’			1
a new @entity284 will give police the power to move on troublemakers without having to first designate a specific ‘ dispersal zone ’ in advance			0
but a victims ' group said the new measures still did not go far enough			0
the plans to enable residents to force police to take action over anti-social behaviour after three separate incidents or five complaints is still insufficient			2
victims deserve to be taken seriously as soon as they make a report to police , @entity300 said			0
@entity304 , the group 's chief executive , said : ' we hope that the new criminal behaviour order will deliver the rapid response for victims that is needed			2
' but just dishing out the orders wo n't be enough			0
' if the government really wants to put victims first , tough enforcement and follow - up will be required , to avoid making the @entity258 an empty sanction			0
