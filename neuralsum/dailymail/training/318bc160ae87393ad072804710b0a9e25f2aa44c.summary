and that ’s the way we like it			2
there is your advert for racism , right there at @entity9 metro station in the heart of @entity11			1
this poison has just been driven deeper underground , further than we ever thought possible on a night when football should have been celebrating the return of the @entity16			0
it has resurfaced , a filthy stain on the game and the rest of society after an incident that took us to another era			0
scroll down to watch the video @entity27 fans stopped a black man getting on the train before their side 's match with @entity32 the man was twice prevented from getting on the carriage as the fans pushed him back on to the platform fans were also filmed chanting ' we ’re racist , we ’re racist and that ’s the way we like it ' while on the train click here to read our story about the fans preventing a black man from boarding this is a throwback to @entity48 ’s book @entity49 , the depressing account of terrace culture at @entity27 , among others , in the @entity53			1
what a way to remember the return of the @entity16 , with a bunch of hoolies terrorising a black commuter as he attempts to board the subway in the centre of the city			2
‘ we ’re racist , we ’re racist and that ’s the way we like it , ’ they chant after successfully forcing the guy back on to the platform before the doors slam shut			1
how did he feel when he heard their slurred words , a stranger in his own city as a mob of filthy fans hurled their racist abuse at him on the platform ? we should be embarrassed			1
this is thug life , pervasive attitudes that have no place in society or this sport			0
those images , filmed by another passenger , are deeply disturbing because a pecking order quickly evolves , a clear delineation of cultures and colour			2
there was a clear hierarchy , a ranking system based on numbers and a deep , underlying conviction that they could do what the hell they liked based on the colour of their skin			0
it is difficult to frame that , to imagine how that is even possible			0
they looked down on that commuter , twice shoving him off the carriage before the train doors closed and they made their way towards the @entity111			2
there is a greater shame here because we foolishly , naively , believed the issue of racism among our football supporters was a thing of the past			0
we kidded ourselves , travelling to @entity121 cities convinced that this is an issue that was dealt with a long time ago			0
confronting it is difficult , too , because the temptation is to shy away , to cop a deaf ‘ un and leave it to the authorities to pass on their message			0
that is the easy way out , to be ignorant of the facts and wait for @entity27 to sift through the @entity134 footage and hope they can identify the individuals concerned			2
the incident is a throwback to the depressing terrace culture at @entity27 , among others , in the @entity53 mounted police disperse football fans at @entity142 during @entity27 's defeat by @entity144 in 1985 @entity145 continue their campaign to drive racism out of football the morning after , as those @entity27 supporters head back to @entity150 via @entity151 , by plane or by boat across to @entity154 , they will be hoping to avoid detection			1
before kick - off in @entity111 , the music from @entity158 ' struck up when @entity32 and @entity27 emerged from the tunnel			1
on the video screens @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , among others , sent out their familiar message - @entity166 - in the moments before @entity169 referee @entity168 started the first leg			2
we love these @entity16 nights , the return of prime @entity121 football between some of the great teams after a break during the winter			0
the game was decent enough , a 1 - 1 draw that satisfies both teams and tees up the second leg nicely at @entity142 on march 17			1
so how do the @entity27 players feel , waking up to see the footage of their own supporters from their own football club racially abusing someone who was probably on their way home from work ? there were six black players - @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity199 - in @entity27 ’s squad for the first leg in @entity11			1
it feels awkward and wrong to even count them			0
the message from the club was strong and clear , a warning that @entity27 will support a criminal investigation to identify those involved on that @entity209			1
there should be one from the players too , conveying a powerful message from a united squad at @entity27 to make it clear that this behaviour from their fans is unacceptable			1
they are under no obligation to do so , but it feels like it would be a start - a polite reminder - that it is time for society to move on			0
without it , we barely scratch beneath the surface			0
@entity27 fans let off flares during their @entity16 match against @entity32 @entity230 celebrates after opening the scoring for @entity27 at the @entity111 @entity232 heads home the equaliser for @entity32 to leave the last - 16 tie finely poised			1

@entity27 fans were filmed in @entity11 preventing a black man getting on a train
they also chanted ' we ’re racist , we ’re racist and that ’s the way we like it '
@entity27 have vowed to investigate and support any criminal action
