adult @entity5 have ranked third last in a new international survey graphing basic numeracy skills across the world 's 23 leading labor countries			1
and the literacy results are not much better , with the @entity12 proving well below the international average in the first - ever survey , which tested 5000 @entity5 aged 16 to 65			1
overall only about one in eight @entity5 turned in a top performance in reading			1
scathingly , some 112 people were unable to complete the survey 's standard background questionnaire ' because of a literacy - related barrier : either the inability to communicate in @entity23 or @entity24 or a mental disability '			1
the main problem identified by the data - developed by the @entity28 - was with younger @entity12 workers , who lagged in nearly every category			1
the oldest @entity5 in the sample turned in a higher - than - average performance in reading , with 9 % of test - takers between 55 and 65 years old scoring at the top proficiency level , compared to just 5 % worldwide			1

here people read inside the @entity50 in @entity51 ' adults who have trouble reading , doing math , solving problems and using technology will find the doors of the 21st century workforce close to them , ' said education secretary @entity37 ' adults who have trouble reading , doing math , solving problems and using technology will find the doors of the 21st century workforce close to them , ' @entity37 told @entity67			1
