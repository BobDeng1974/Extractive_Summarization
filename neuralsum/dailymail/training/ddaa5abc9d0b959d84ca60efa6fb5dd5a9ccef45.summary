it is ten times harder for a woman to become pregnant at 43 than at 37 , doctors have warned			0
the rapid speeding up of a woman ’s biological clock means that by the time she is 43 , she will need to go through 44 eggs on average to produce just one normal embryo			0
at 37 she needs just 4.4 , on average			0
a woman typically produces one egg a month , so this means it will take her almost four years to conceive – rather than only four months			0
researcher @entity15 said that the number of eggs needed for a viable pregnancy rises ‘ almost exponentially ’ after 42 , and urged women to freeze their eggs without delay			1
@entity23 experts said that while , ideally , women would have their babies in their twenties , the realities of modern life mean many have no choice but to wait			1
the research comes amid concern that growing numbers of women are risking the heartbreak of infertility by leaving it until middle - age to try to start a family			0
education , careers , lack of money and the hunt for ‘ mr @entity45 ’ are all causing women to put motherhood on the back burner			1
no delay : experts say that women who want to freeze their eggs should do so in their late twenties or early thirties to have the best chance of success later			1
above , a female egg is artificially inseminated nearly half of all @entity23 babies are now born to women aged 30 and older , and the number born to women in their late thirties has almost trebled in recent years			1
controversially , internet companies @entity64 and @entity65 are offering to pay female employees to freeze their eggs			2
on the back burner : nearly half of all @entity23 babies are born to women aged 30 and older			1
file image the ‘ perk ’ – at the moment for employees in the @entity80 only – is aimed at boosting the number of women staff by allowing them to focus on their careers without sacrificing the opportunity to have children later in life			1
dr @entity15 , of the @entity81 , @entity82 , analysed data on 198 women aged between 20 and 45 having ivf treatment			1
this included how many eggs they produced , and the health of the embryos produced after they were fertilised in a dish			0
not surprisingly , the younger women produced more eggs – and more genetically normal embryos			2
dr @entity15 calculated that a woman under 35 would on average need just 3.8 eggs to make one healthy embryo			0
between the ages of 35 and 37 , 4.4 eggs would be needed			2
the figure starts to climb at 38			0
women aged between 38 and 40 need 9.4 eggs and women aged 41 to 42 need 10.1			1
the number then soars , as fertility plummets , with women aged over 42 needing 44 eggs , the @entity106 ’s annual conference in @entity107 heard			1
importantly , the women studied were fertile , despite having @entity112 , and so it is thought the results apply to women trying to conceive naturally			0
experts say that women who want to freeze their eggs should do so in their late twenties or early thirties to have the best chance of success later			2
but @entity112 pioneer @entity123 has said that fewer than 8 per cent of those who thaw their eggs and have @entity112 will go on to have a baby			0
around 500 women a year pay up to £ 3,000 to freeze their eggs until they want to start a family .			2
