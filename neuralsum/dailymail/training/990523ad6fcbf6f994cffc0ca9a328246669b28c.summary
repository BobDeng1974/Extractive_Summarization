by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 as @entity2 try to find room for the class of ’ 92 in the new order at @entity6 , they should perhaps be more concerned over the future of a more recent graduate of their academy			1
it is hard to think of a more willing , less confrontational individual than @entity13			1
so when the 23 - year - old @entity16 striker grows so unhappy that he considers leaving a club that has been part of his life since he was spotted by @entity2 at the age of eight , we should take notice			1
last month , sources close to @entity13 revealed that he was ready to quit @entity6 after the @entity25 with two years still left on his contract			1
their claims , largely confirmed by an interview the player gave over the weekend , suggested that he had grown disillusioned under @entity31			2
stay put : @entity2 must do all that they can in order to keep homegrown @entity13 at the club problems : @entity13 felt like a ' victim ' under the old regime , shunted out wide instead of playing centrally he felt like ‘ a victim ’ of the new ( now old ) regime , they said , shunted out on to the left in a 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation that denied him the central striking role he prefers			1
@entity13 was also alarmed to hear comments from @entity31 in december saying that he needed to work harder in training			1
the managerial change at @entity6 might have headed off this particular crisis for now although , intriguingly , @entity13 refused to say if @entity31 going would necessarily mean that he will stay			1
after all , @entity49 is known to favour 4 - 3 - 3 and , for all his promise , @entity13 remains behind @entity51 and @entity52 in the pecking order for that central berth			2
as @entity2 prepare to welcome their new first continental coach and more foreign signings this summer , they need to keep homegrown players like @entity13 now more than ever , and not just for the purposes of @entity61 football that will not concern the fallen @entity63 champions for another year			1
@entity64 might have offered a glimpse into the future earlier this month when he gave first - team debuts to @entity68 and @entity69 against @entity70 in his last home game in charge , but the days when local talent like @entity64 , @entity74 , @entity75 and the @entity77 brothers seemed to roll out of the academy on a conveyor belt are a distant memory			0
it was a vintage year , 1992 , but have there been any like it since ? what did you say ? ! @entity31 questioned the player 's work rate in training while at @entity2 last season questions raised : @entity49 prefers a 4 - 3 - 3 formation , which could be a struggle for @entity13 next year @entity13 may complain he was played out of position by @entity31 but his goals per game ratio was actually better under him than under sir @entity95 or @entity64 @entity13 under @entity31 matches : 33			1
@entity13 under @entity95 / @entity64 matches : 106			2
goals : 19 @entity2 can still bring through top talent			2
some , like @entity101 , stay			0
others , like @entity103 , move on			0
but @entity101 and @entity103 only moved to @entity6 at the age of 16 from foreign clubs			2
@entity13 was brought up in nearby @entity106 and joined at the age of 11			2
a local hero at a club whose proud history of producing players from within will forever be associated with the @entity112			0
across town at @entity117 , the club ’s @entity114 owners recognise the importance of local identity and are desperate for @entity120 – @entity121 - born and raised in @entity122 – to sign a new contract even though the defender only made two @entity63 appearances last season			0
he is unlikely to oblige			0
of course , origin is of little importance without talent , but few would question @entity13 ’s potential			0
he has come through @entity2 ’s academy , paid his dues on loan at @entity135 and @entity136 , and established himself as first - team regular and possible @entity25 starter for @entity16			1
talent : @entity101 has started brightly at @entity6 but was only brought to the cub when he was 16 blooding : @entity69 was given his chance by interim manager @entity64 against @entity70 earlier this month it has not always been easy			0
of his 139 career appearances for @entity2 , 50 have come off the bench			0
many more have been in that less preferable position out on the left			0
last season he only scored two goals , although it is worth noting that one of those came during a career highlight at the @entity154 when @entity13 almost single - handedly had @entity156 on the ropes with his power and pace			0
another 10 goals followed in 36 games for @entity2 in a difficult season under @entity31 , but that still does not compare with @entity13 ’s eight in 21 internationals for his country			1
‘ maybe i ’m kind of let off the leash a bit more for @entity16 , ’ he admits			0
of all the promising young strikers on @entity2 ’s books down the years ( @entity68 and @entity169 are the latest ) , none have come closer to becoming a true star than @entity13			1
as he heads off to @entity174 this summer with the best years of his career still ahead of him , that is something the club and @entity178 should bear in mind .			0

@entity16 striker could leave @entity6 this summer
@entity13 was a ' victim ' of the @entity31 regime
@entity2 have *n't* been blessed with many *youngsters* coming through
