by @entity0 @entity1 , the @entity2 secretary of state , has said he chose the wrong word in describing @entity5 's potential future after being criticized for saying the jewish state could become an ' apartheid state ' if it does not reach a peace deal with the @entity9			1
in a statement released yesterday by the @entity11 , @entity1 lashed out against ' partisan political ' attacks against him , but acknowledged his comments last week to a closed international forum could have been misinterpreted			1
he pointedly did not apologize for the remarks , but stressed he was , and is , a strong supporter of @entity5 , which he called a ' vibrant democracy			1
and , he stressed , he does not believe @entity5 is , or is definitely on track to become , an ' apartheid state			0
' ' i will not allow my commitment to @entity5 to be questioned by anyone , particularly for partisan , political purposes , so i want to be crystal clear about what i believe and what i do n't believe , ' @entity1 said after @entity2 lawmakers and pro-israel groups criticized him , with some demanding his resignation or at least an apology			1
' first , @entity5 is a vibrant democracy and i do not believe , nor have i ever stated , publicly or privately , that @entity5 is an apartheid state or that it intends to become one , ' he said			1
' second , i have been around long enough to also know the power of words to create a misimpression , even when unintentional , and if i could rewind the tape , i would have chosen a different word to describe my firm belief that the only way in the long term to have a jewish state and two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two state solution , ' @entity1 said			2
on sunday , @entity58 reported that @entity1 had told a closed - door meeting of the @entity60 in @entity61 on friday that @entity5 risked becoming an ' apartheid state ' with two classes of citizens if negotiations to forge a peace deal fail and a two - state solution is not reached			2
in his statement , @entity1 defended his general point , noting that numerous @entity5 officials , including prime minister @entity71 and predecessors , @entity73 and @entity74 , have offered similar assessments in the past			0
palestinians waving @entity9 flags as they gathered last week to celebrate the newly made reconciliation deal between @entity80 and @entity81 , ending a seven - year split but , he said while @entity73 and @entity74 , and @entity5 justice minister @entity84 , ' have all invoked the specter of apartheid to underscore the dangers of a unitary state for the future , it is a word best left out of the debate here at home			1
' the report of @entity1 's ' apartheid ' comment to the @entity60 was immediately assailed by many the @entity96 community in the @entity2 @entity99 @entity98 leader @entity97 , @entity100 , said @entity1 should apologize , while the powerful @entity101 described his use of the term as ' offensive			0
' another pro-israel lobby group demanded that @entity1 resign , a call echoed by @entity98 sen. @entity107 of @entity108 in a speech on the @entity111 floor @entity113 sen. @entity112 of @entity114 was also critical of @entity1 's comment , saying in a tweet that : ' @entity5 is the only democracy in the @entity118 and any linkage between @entity5 and apartheid is nonsensical and ridiculous			1
' in his statement , @entity1 defended his general point , noting that numerous @entity5 officials , including prime minister @entity71 ( pictured ) and predecessors , @entity73 and @entity74 , have offered similar assessments in the past @entity1 has invested significant time and energy since he became @entity2 's top diplomat last year into bringing the two sides to the negotiating table with the goal of reaching a deal in nine months			2
that deadline expires on tuesday with the parties having failed to reach that settlement , a less ambitious framework deal or even an agreement to extend the negotiations			0
