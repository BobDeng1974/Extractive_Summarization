@entity0 has become the first manager of a major @entity3 club to encourage his players to go to the @entity5 with @entity6 this summer			1
the @entity8 boss wants @entity9 , @entity10 and other @entity8 youngsters to be picked in @entity13 's squad for the finals in the @entity15 at the end of the season believing it will help further their careers			1
' that tournament is a very good education and i said that as the coach of the @entity25 national team as well , ' said @entity26			0
@entity0 wants his @entity8 youngsters to feature at the @entity30 21 @entity29 championships @entity10 ( left ) and @entity9 are two @entity8 players who would be eligible to play for @entity6 's @entity32 @entity26 points to the success of his @entity35 side ( including @entity36 ) at the @entity37 as proof @entity13 could have as many as eight extra players available to select for the @entity40 next year : @entity41 , @entity42 @entity43 , @entity44 @entity45 , @entity44 @entity46 , @entity44 @entity9 , @entity8 @entity10 , @entity8 @entity47 , @entity48 @entity49 , @entity48 ' my defenders at the @entity37 ( who reached the semi-finals ) @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity36 had all played in the @entity30 championship			1
it 's a good experience not many players have			2
' @entity26 's support is in direct contrast to the reservations of fellow @entity3 bosses @entity63 and @entity64 and will be a huge boost to @entity66 who are trying to make international competitions taken more seriously within @entity70 football			1
following @entity6 's qualification last week for the finals , @entity63 questioned why @entity6 should call up his young star at @entity74 for the tournament while @entity44 manager @entity64 has regularly opposed full internationals like @entity45 and @entity43 dropping back into the @entity32			1
former @entity78 manager @entity77 recently hit out at @entity79 for picking @entity81 midfielder @entity80 for the full @entity6 squad after he 'd turned down the chance to be with the @entity32			0
@entity77 is convinced @entity6 's weak performances in junior competitions has had an impact on recent @entity37 showings			0
in contrast , the @entity89 side that triumphed in @entity90 was packed with @entity78 champions such as @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96			0
@entity26 , who has worked with several top - class youngsters in his career including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , has five @entity8 players in contention for the finals ; £ 27million left - back @entity9 who played in the play - off win against @entity108 , @entity10 , brothers @entity109 and @entity111 , and @entity112			1
and the @entity25 does n't see any problem with young players extending their season			2
@entity64 is one of the managers who has come out and said he does n't want his players going @entity26 has worked with several top youth stars , including @entity99 ( centre ) at @entity120 ' i do n't think it is even a question or worth having a discussion			1
but that 's my view because i think all the players want to play			2
' for me as a trainer - coach of a club , i am very happy that @entity9 is playing with the @entity32			2
he played for the @entity32 while ( @entity130 ) @entity129 was on the bench for the @entity133 senior team			1
that is not a benefit for him , it was a two - week holiday			0
' he would have been better at the @entity32			0
i think youngsters have to play			0
when they are free , they need to play			0
@entity9 was also happy to be with the @entity32 as he needs match rhythm			0
' so it was good for everyone – the national @entity78 team , for me and for @entity9			0
' @entity6 went to the last @entity145 final under @entity77 in @entity146 without 17 eligible players and failed to qualify from their group			0
@entity45 and @entity41 would be eligible to play in the @entity15 @entity149 would be grateful to have several senior stars in his squad next summer @entity79 chats to @entity41 prior to @entity6 's game against @entity153 last week @entity13 is anxious to avoid a similar drain on resources next year but will only include players who have won full caps if they are mentally ready to rejoin the @entity158			1
@entity9 , 19 , went to the last @entity37 in @entity79 's squad but would happily play for the junior team to try and help @entity6 win their first @entity78 title since 1984			1
@entity41 , @entity43 , @entity10 , @entity47 , @entity49 and @entity45 are also young enough to be eligible but @entity26 accepts you should n't force individual players to go if they themselves think they are fatigued			1
' not every player is the same and i , as a manager , have to know that			0
some players are too tired to play so the managers and the medical departments or the club and federation have to communicate better , ' he said .			2

@entity9 and @entity10 would be eligible for @entity13 's squad
@entity0 says youngsters only improve by playing regularly
points to @entity129 sitting on the @entity133 bench as an example
several @entity3 managers have said they do n't want players going
@entity45 and @entity41 could also play in tournament
