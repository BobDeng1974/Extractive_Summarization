scientists claim they have answered one of the biggest questions in geology ; why do tectonic plates beneath the @entity6 's surface sometimes move abruptly ? in a new study , @entity8 geologists believe the answer comes down to a combination of the thick crusts and weakened mineral grains			1
those effects acting together , they say , could explain a range of relatively ' speedy ' moves among tectonic plates around the world , from @entity19 to @entity20			0
pictured is a diagram of a coastal area where an ocean plate is subducting beneath a continental plate ' our planet is probably most distinctly marked by the fact that it has plate tectonics , ' said @entity38 geophysicist @entity37 , lead author of the research			0
' our work here looks at the evolution of plate tectonics			0
how and why do plates change directions over time ? ' traditionally , scientists believed that all tectonic plates are pulled by subducting slabs - which result from the colder , top boundary layer of the @entity6 's rocky surface becoming heavy and sinking slowly into the deeper mantle			1
yet that process does not account for sudden plate shifts – which in geological terms is still a million years or longer			1
thick crust from continents or oceanic plateaux is swept into the subduction zone prompting the slab to break off			1
the result is tectonic plates that abruptly shift horizontally , or continents suddenly bobbing up such abrupt movement requires that slabs detach from their plates , but doing this quickly is difficult since the slabs should be too cold and stiff to detach			1
according to the @entity38 study , there are additional factors at work			0
thick crust from continents or oceanic plateaux is swept into the subduction zone , plugging it up and prompting the slab to break off			1
the detachment process is then accelerated when mineral grains in the necking slab start to shrink , causing the slab to weaken rapidly			1
the result is tectonic plates that abruptly shift horizontally , or continents suddenly bobbing up			2
' understanding this helps us understand how the tectonic plates change through the @entity6 's history , ' professor @entity37 said			2
' it adds to our knowledge of the evolution of our planet , including its climate and biosphere			0
' researchers say weak zones caused the @entity6 's mantle to crack , causing tectonic plates to form they are responsible for the formation of continents , and are still active - as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions show			1
however , researchers have never been able to work out why the @entity6 developed tectonic plates , but other planets did not			2
but in april , they @entity38 said it had solved the mystery - and say the key is tiny minerals within rocks			0
the research suggests how and when @entity6 came to develop one of its most distinct features — rigid tectonic plates — and why @entity113 , @entity6 ’s twin - like neighbor , never has			2
' we think it all comes down to the behavior of tiny grains of minerals within rocks , ' said @entity38 geophysicist @entity37 , lead author of research published online april 6 in the journal @entity124			0
the researchers argue that in @entity6 ’s early days , mantle convection caused weak zones in the lithosphere - the outermost shell of the planet			0
these zones persisted , developed into plate boundaries , and ultimately connected to form a global network of tectonic plates			0
the weak zones , they argue , resulted from the tendency of mineral grains in rocks to shrink as the rock deforms .			2

scientists have long been puzzled by @entity6 's sudden plate shifts
such abrupt movement requires that slabs detach from their plates
but *current* *models* suggest the slabs are too cold and stiff to detach
instead , thick crust from continents are causing the slab to break off
this is then accelerated when mineral grains in the slab start to shrink
