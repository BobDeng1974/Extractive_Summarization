by @entity0 look away now , @entity2 fans			1
as if thursday 's night 's result was n't bad enough , @entity3 have now claimed @entity6 's side have only a measly 13 per cent chance of progressing from @entity8 @entity2 are relying on @entity9 to beat both @entity10 and @entity11 if they are to stand any hope of qualifying for the knockout phase of the @entity14 ; but their chances of doing so stand at only 12.9 per cent , according to the world 's leaders in sports analytics technology			1
@entity9 , who beat @entity2 in their @entity8 clash on saturday , have a healthy 86 per cent chance of making the last 16 while @entity10 , whom the @entity22 face later on friday , have a 1 in 2 hope of progressing to the latter stages of the competition			1
not all white on the night : @entity27 are facing @entity14 elimination after thursday night 's defeat table : @entity2 are facing an uphill challenge to progress to the last 16 after losing both of their games so far @entity33 needs @entity22 miracle @entity11 , with a fit and firing @entity36 to call upon following his brace against the @entity2 , have a 47 per cent hope of progressing from @entity8 meanwhile , former @entity2 winger @entity39 was among those to hit out at @entity2 's lacklustre display			1
the former @entity2 winger turned on the culture of the @entity44 after watching the @entity2 fall to the brink of @entity14 exit			1
focussing on the impact he feels the @entity44 - and its foreign players - has on the side he won 62 caps for , he said : ' i 'm not angry , i 'm just fed up of talking about the same old problems			0
' i 'll tell you what the biggest problem is when you think about it all - the @entity44			0
they have a product which they sell around the world			0
it 's entertaining but it 's doing our players no good whatsoever			0
king of the castle : @entity36 celebrates with his @entity11 team - mates at the final whistle dejection : @entity2 fans are dealt yet more heartache after watching their team slump to a successive defeat ' this ( @entity2 ) is a @entity44 side playing tonight which is meant to be the best league in the world			1
you 're not telling me all those @entity82 players would get in many teams around the world , apart from ( @entity36 ) @entity36 who was only 75 per cent fit			0
( @entity88 ) @entity87 possibly			0
apart from that , who else is there ? ' the former @entity93 wendesday man went on to add that he feels it is players like two - goal @entity36 who makes the @entity44 what it is			2
" we go on banging the drum that we 've got this and that			0
. do you know what makes the @entity44 exciting ? players like @entity36 - the foreign players , ' he said			2
back of the net : @entity108 's @entity36 scores the decisive goal in @entity11 's 2 - 1 victory over @entity2 ' we hype our players up massively like we always do , say we 've got this and that			1
' look at their ( @entity11 's ) back four tonight			2
the kid at centre - half ( @entity117 ) he 's played two games for @entity120 , he 's not had a cap , but they know how to win games			1
' the difference between @entity44 football and international football is how to win a football match			0
it 's not about picking your star players , he plays for @entity108 , he plays for @entity133 , it 's about getting a balance in the side to get a result and we never , ever do			2

@entity108 's @entity36 scored both goals for @entity11 in @entity8 clash
