by @entity0 @entity1 admits that there is plenty of pressure on both @entity5 and himself to get through their fights at the @entity9 in @entity10 in order to set up a huge rematch			1
cleverly returns to the scene of his @entity19 world light heavyweight title triumph over @entity21 in october 2011 , and since then their bitter rivalry has shown no signs of cooling			0
promoter @entity24 has dubbed the show @entity25 as he looks to set up a long - awaited tussle between the pair later in the year to put the bad - blood to rest once and for all			2
close encounter : @entity1 ( right ) takes on @entity32 in @entity10 before such a firecracker of a clash can be negotiated though , both men must come through tough @entity37 assignments in only their second bouts at cruiserweight			1
@entity5 faces @entity42 ko merchant @entity40 while @entity1 says he is on red alert against dangerous @entity44 @entity32			1
' he seems confident and he 's got nothing to lose so he 's going to give it a good go and i ca n't afford to slip - up , ' said @entity1 , who scaled 14st 2lbs 11oz , heavier than his 13st 13lbs 10oz opponent			2
lets do it again : @entity1 and @entity5 are set to rematch later this year ' it 's the calm before storm really , we both have business to take care of first but this is ' @entity25 ' - the idea is that @entity5 and i both win and we get the rematch on			1
but until that business is done you can not fully focus on it			0
' sometimes you can be in danger of thinking one step ahead when you have something right in front of you			0
i am very confident i will do the business on saturday , ' @entity5 should do the same against his guy , and then we 're going to get it on and you will see some more fireworks between us i bet			0

@entity1 takes on @entity32 in @entity10
@entity5 faces @entity40 on the same bill
