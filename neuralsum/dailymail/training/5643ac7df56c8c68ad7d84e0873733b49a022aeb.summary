in a potentially threatening blow to @entity2 ’s porn industry voters have passed a measure that will require condom use during production despite fear it could put @entity7 ’ porn industry dually under wrap			1
passed by 55.9 per cent of voters on tuesday , @entity10 will additionally raise fees in adult film productions potentially driving out the industry from @entity7 , according to the ballot 's opposition			1
' the effect would be simply to have no scenes , or much , much fewer scenes shot in @entity7 , ' @entity19 , also known as ' @entity19 ' who owns @entity20 , one of the nation 's top porn production companies , told @entity25 before the measure ’s passing			1
fear of those rising costs earned support against the measure by the @entity58 in an editorial late last month			2
‘ though it is well intentioned , requiring the use of condoms in adult movies is likely to stymie @entity65 government and bring little benefit to performers , ’ the paper wrote			1
the measure , pressed by the @entity69 , is modelled after similar health permits applied to tattoo shops , massage parlours and bathhouses			2
opposition : @entity19 , owner of @entity20 , one of the top porn production companies in the country , has rallied against the measure saying with its passing he may move his business outside the city the paper sides with the promotion of safe sex with a recent @entity58 blog article reporting adult film stars in @entity65 having higher rates of gonorrhea and chlamydia than legal prostitutes in @entity91			1
the paper argues the promotion of condom use without government force , however , fearing the measure could negatively effect an estimated $ 1billion to $ 2billion industry			1
' my general manager pointed out that it ’s far more dangerous to play @entity100 baseball than it is to perform in porn without condoms			1
and it ’s true , ' mr @entity19 argued to the @entity25			2
' i played @entity100 baseball , and i got hit in the head a few times			0
it was far more dangerous , and i risked more than i physically risked being in porn , and i did not get @entity109 from being in porn , ' he said			0
with the measure 's passing mr @entity19 said he expects some scenes to go underground while he personally expects ‘ to just shoot in other places			1
' benefits : supporters of the mandate argued its protection against @entity119 with a recent study finding that 28 per cent of 168 performers in @entity65 having gonorrhea , chlamydia or both siding with mr @entity19 , last month performers @entity125 and @entity127 argued in a public service announcement that since 2000 only six porn performers have tested positive for @entity109			1
in comparison , with @entity10 supporters likening condom use as way to protect workers in the workplace - much the same like helmets at construction sites - the actors argue that in the same time period over 60,000 @entity139 died from far more dangerous occupations			1
as the @entity58 reported , 28 per cent of 168 performers tested were found having either gonorrhea or chlamydia or both diseases using research from the @entity52 , the @entity147 and @entity148			0
responding to those numbers and a possible affect by the measure 's passing , @entity20 's general manager @entity149 told the @entity58 it ' does zero to ameliorate the spread of gonorrhea or chlamydia among this population			2
' mr @entity19 says he and others plan to challenge the measure in court hopeful of an injunction			0
in opposition , the @entity69 hailed the measure 's passing as a major victory in their fight against @entity119 , touting that ' taxpayers pay over $ 500,000 for every hiv infection that ends in free clinics			1
' most performers have no health insurance ! ' they wrote on their @entity169 page			0
lot to think about : voters at the @entity65 lifeguard headquarters are seen casting their vote not only for the presidential race but to mandate condoms other concerns : also on the ballot , arguing whether to maintain the state 's death penalty , 54 per cent of voters checked in its favour despite concerns it is costing hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily softer stance : voters in @entity2 also opted for a loosening of the state 's ' three strike ' rules against habitual criminals early voting results to proposition 34 showed a 54 per cent opposition to end its use			1
campaigners in favour of abolishing capital punishment had based their argument on the question of cost rather than morality , saying the financially troubled state could save hundreds of millions of dollars by instead jailing the worst killers for life			0
while @entity2 voters appeared to oppose ending the death penalty , they broadly approved another ballot measure to soften the state 's controversial ' three strikes ' law , which gives longer sentences to habitual criminals			2
the ' three strikes ' reform measure had received over 68 per cent of the vote after two - thirds of the precincts had declared , and organisers declared victory			2
the proposition would let some criminals who have been in jail twice avoid a 25 years to life sentence for a third crime if it is judged to be non-violent and non-serious			0
supporters of the measure argued that filling prisons with people who presented no threat to society is expensive and is often counter-productive in rehabilitating them away from crime			1
' this historic victory overturns the long - held conventional wisdom that it 's impossible to fix our most extreme and unjust crime laws - and hopefully inspires future efforts , ' said campaign spokesman @entity236			0
however , efforts to abolish the death penalty fell short with just 46 per cent of the vote			0
public opinion in the @entity139 has been moving away from the death penalty , with five states abolishing it during the past decade			0
seventeen states and the @entity243 do not allow the death penalty			0
a federal judge halted all @entity2 executions in 2006 , saying a three - drug lethal injection risked causing inmates too much pain and suffering before death			0
executions have not yet resumed			0
despite the suspension of this deterrent , crime in @entity2 , like the rest of the nation , has continues to fall dramatically .			0

55.9 per cent voted for condoms ' use in all porn films made in @entity7
@entity7 's porn industry *criticized* the measure fearing the adult film industry will lose business
mandate b supporters argued taxpayers paying over $ 500,000 for every hiv infection at free clinics with most actors not having insurance
