by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity1 has an interesting take on the match that made him famous overnight			1
thrust into the starting @entity4 against @entity5 on may 19 , 2012 , he did the job requested of him by @entity7 to help @entity8 claim @entity10 glory			1
‘ it ’s something i do n’t want people to forget , i ’ve had success at the highest level , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ but , personally , i do n't want to rest on my laurels , i 've got the taste and it ’s something i want to actively pursue			0
’ video : scroll down to watch @entity1 talk about his @entity8 future onwards and upwards : @entity1 wants progress , which he wo n't find warming the bench at @entity8 @entity24 : @entity1 filled in to help @entity8 win the 2012 @entity10 against @entity5 it is that mentality that influences his next choice ; to stick or twist			1
@entity1 does not want to be remembered solely as the shock selection that paid off ; he craves fresh accomplishments			2
he made 38 appearances last campaign , as well as earning two @entity33 caps , and when @entity8 turned down an approach from @entity35 in the summer @entity1 believed game - time under @entity37 would follow			1
yet after only 244 minutes of action in the first - half of this season he went on loan to @entity41 in january in search of football and has enjoyed a personally successful spell despite the team ’s struggles			1
this summer will be the most definitive of his career ; talks with @entity37 will determine his future			2
‘ at the start of this season the aim was to play first - team football and that ’s the impression i was under , ’ says @entity1			1
‘ that ’s the reason i was at @entity8 ; i ’ve never been one to just sit there and be comfortable in my surroundings			2
‘ if you look at my record since i ’ve been back at @entity8 from my loan spells ( in january 2011 ) , the games have been increasing by season – as long as i could see that i was always happy to stay ‘ the start of this season has been the only time when there has been quite a delay in my development			1
as soon as those alarm bells were ringing it was important i got out to play			2
farmed out : the 24 - year - old has had a decent run of games after being loaned out to struggling @entity41 ‘ it ’s something we ’ll sit down and talk about in the summer			1
at this stage in my career i need to be playing			0
to go back next year to @entity8 and sit on the bench is not what i want			1
‘ i feel i deserve the chance to play consistently , having had the experiences that i have done under numerous managers			2
’ at 24 years old that feeling is understandable			0
if @entity1 were to depart it would leave promises about increasing the number of home - grown graduates in the @entity8 team sounding hollow			1
here is a player , signed by tribunal from @entity90 in 2005 , who has developed through the system only to find a blockage at the end			0
@entity41 represented a good opportunity and while a relegation fight was not on the agenda it has added a string to @entity1 ’s bow			1
@entity99 , who @entity1 knows from his @entity8 days , was again interested in the winter window but by this time @entity35 were title challengers and @entity8 could not countenance assisting a direct rival			1
tug of war : @entity37 has refused @entity99 ' ( @entity104 ) attempts to take @entity1 to @entity35 loan ranger : @entity1 is prepared to travel anywhere to play - having already spent time with six clubs @entity41 ’s financial situation means a permanent switch to @entity111 for @entity1 , who has a house with his @entity114 girlfriend and two - year - old daughter in @entity116 , is unlikely			1
‘ if i was to leave @entity8 i want to stay within the best teams in the @entity118			2
to keep my own ambitions to progress and play for @entity33 i need to be right up there , playing consistently at a decent level			1
’ @entity1 has two years left on his @entity8 contract but money elsewhere will not be a deciding factor			1
nor will location , having been all over the country in six loan moves			0
‘ i was saying to my mate the other day : “ i think i could drive round the whole country , no problem			0
” i 've been to @entity132 on the @entity133 ; @entity134 , that ’s @entity135 ; @entity136 , the far east of the country ; @entity138 , towards the west country ; @entity141 , the @entity140 ; and @entity111 , @entity142			0
‘ i ’m looking forward to getting settled for the first time			0
it 'll be purely about playing football			0
’ @entity147 's roar ! @entity1 ( c ) wants to build on his @entity33 career , which has seen him earn two caps so far it was all about playing on the biggest stage two years ago			1
but his mum @entity152 nearly did not travel to @entity153			0
‘ i had given away my tickets and told her there was no point in her coming out , my chances of playing were at best slim , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ she ended up booking the flight anyway without me knowing			0
it must have been mothers ’ intuition			0
imagine if i 'd played the final and she 's been stuck at home – i 'd never have lived it down			0
‘ that january there was talk of a move to @entity174 , then @entity7 took over			0
it can change at a drop of a hat			0
that ’s why i always say , “ make sure you 're training , make sure you 're ready			0

@entity1 rose to fame after helping @entity8 win the 2012 @entity10
the 24 - year - old has impressed on loan with struggling @entity41 , the sixth club he has been farmed out to
@entity37 refused @entity99 ' request to take him to @entity35
