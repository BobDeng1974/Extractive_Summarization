by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 the last time @entity3 were in the ‘ @entity4 ’ , they had become figures of fun and were mercilessly mocked as they made a shambolic exit from the @entity9			1
that was three years and a veritable lifetime ago			2
the locals are n’t laughing at @entity14 ’s national team now			2
the joke has long since worn off			0
instead , @entity16 are coming to terms – somewhat grudgingly – with the fact that @entity3 are emerging as very serious challengers to their beloved @entity21 ’ global pre-eminence			1
saturday ’s tense first test at @entity23 may just go down as the watershed occasion when the national team proved they really are capable of wresting the @entity9 from @entity21 next year			1
amid the devastation of losing a game they could have won , @entity3 will seize on some highly encouraging signs about their collective development			1
they exposed the fact that the @entity21 are afflicted by mortality — in defiance of popular myth — and also obliterated the notion that weary @entity56 teams must head south in june and meekly accept their medicine			1
it is now evident that @entity3 are not battling demons on this side of the @entity61			1
these tourists will not accept the age - old perception that in these parts , they are inherently inferior			2
@entity66 spirit no longer withers in the @entity67 , thanks to the conviction generated by heartening past results and the coaches ’ ability to instil soaring confidence in their players , even those who have been out of form or lacking match - fitness			2
@entity78 is a case in point			0
the last time he was here he was lampooned after jumping off a ferry for a dip in the harbour			0
war dance : the @entity21 perform the haka ahead of kick off at @entity23 on target : @entity88 kicks a penalty during @entity3 's first test against @entity21 @entity78 had n’t played for his country all season due to injury but he stormed back to prominence on saturday			1
@entity21 had suffered from the @entity97 centre ’s marauding midfield presence during their record defeat at @entity100 18 months ago and how they suffered again this time			1
the 23 - year - old pounded the home defence and the @entity16 were simply unable to contain him			1
after @entity34 ’s late try had condemned @entity107 ’s heroic side to a heart - breaking fate , @entity78 cut a disconsolate figure			1
in days gone by , this result would have generated @entity66 satisfaction but not this time			0
the @entity114 ’s trademark grin was largely eclipsed by a stern demeanour as he made it abundantly clear that glorious failure would not suffice			0
‘ no - one is happy that we have lost today , ’ he said			1
‘ a loss is a loss			0
it does n’t matter if you lose by one point or 40 so the boys in the changing - room are gutted			2
i think we should have won			0
we had a few opportunities but we did n’t finish them			0
in games like this you are only going to get one or two chances and you have to take them			0
’ bombing forward : @entity134 @entity133 makes a break against @entity21 at @entity23 in @entity4 back with a bang : @entity137 is tackled @entity138 on his @entity3 comeback clockwork : @entity3 's @entity141 rises highest to claim the ball from a line - out on the charge : @entity145 makes a break from full back in the first test asked if @entity3 ’s progress was such that they now regard themselves as the @entity21 ’ equals , @entity78 added : ‘ absolutely			1
we played well , we held on to the ball well , we defended well			0
but it is all about those little margins			0
the good thing is we ’ve got two matches left and we still have the opportunity to go for the series			0
’ to a man , @entity3 ’s players and coaches lamented their cruel demise at @entity23 and expressed the view that they can fight back in this three - @entity164 series by beating @entity21 in @entity43 this saturday			1
@entity165 , who was outstanding at @entity166 , insisted that this result was n’t a catalyst for belief among the tourists because they already possessed it in abundance			0
‘ we did n’t have any fear , ’ said the @entity173 forward			0
‘ the confidence in our squad has been building over the last couple of years and we just feel stronger and stronger			2
we will go away from this game , rectify things and continue to improve			2
we believe in our squad and how we play			0
if you go into a test match with elements of doubt you have lost before you begin			2
’ flying winger : @entity3 's @entity186 attempts to beat the tackle of @entity188 ( left ) and @entity189 comeback : @entity191 scored two penalties to put @entity21 back into the lead with ten minutes to go dangerous break : @entity195 charges at the @entity21 defence as @entity3 clear their lines @entity199 ball : @entity21 scrum half @entity201 keeps the @entity21 attack ticking there was no doubt or fear , which is an endorsement of the work done by @entity3 ’s coaches			1
it was an occasion which provided further evidence that @entity107 and his assistants have the technical , tactical and motivational qualities to turn their team into a major global force			0
frankly , given the uniquely trying circumstances , the visitors were not expected to make a game of it			2
forced to operate without around a dozen of their leading players the @entity223 management worked wonders to bring the best out of the men left standing			0
certain members of the starting xv had gone into this daunting fixture against a backdrop of poor or disrupted seasons but almost to a man they delivered , notably @entity88 and @entity195 as a raw 10 - 12 combination			1
the fundamental point is that the @entity3 set - up now serves as a centre of excellence , enhancing those involved , and that has not always been the case			1
players appear to grow in stature within the national ranks			0
heavy hitter : @entity3 no 8 @entity165 carries the ball upfield making yards : @entity21 's @entity246 leaves @entity3 's @entity88 lying on the ground late blow : @entity249 is shown a yellow card by referee @entity251 after illegal play at the breakdown late charge : @entity255 made an immediate impact after coming off the bench in the second half yet , for all the encouragement , a famous victory proved beyond captain @entity133 and co. they were not behind on the scoreboard until 10 minutes from time and when @entity21 snatched their late try , @entity3 were down to 14 men as @entity249 was in the sin - bin			1
inexplicably , @entity268 and @entity269 escaped yellow - card punishment for cynical acts of foul play and those were not the only dubious decisions made by referee @entity251 which hurt @entity3			1
but they kept any sense of injustice under wraps — pointing instead to costly handling errors and a lack of clinical precision when chances were created			0
the @entity21 were forced into a torrent of mistakes but when it mattered they found a way to win a test they could have lost , which has become a hallmark under @entity286			1
yet , their profound relief will have been tempered by the knowledge that @entity3 are coming for them , with increasing purpose			2
in this series and in next year ’s @entity9 , the @entity223 is destined to become a symbol of danger , challenging @entity295 supremacy			0
powerful : @entity269 of the @entity21 is hauled down by @entity165 and @entity141 deadly touch : veteran centre @entity34 dives over in the corner at @entity23 jubilation : @entity34 is congratulated by team - mate @entity189 after scoring the only try of the match @entity302 effort : @entity165 and @entity195 of @entity3 walk through the tunnel after the final test			1

@entity3 *narrowly* lost 20 - 15 to @entity21 at @entity23
all *blacks* have not been beaten at their rugby *citadel* for 20 years
a late try from @entity34 sealed *dramatic* victory for the @entity16
@entity3 were in front for most of the game thanks to penalties from @entity88
@entity255 kicked a late penalty on his return to @entity3 action
