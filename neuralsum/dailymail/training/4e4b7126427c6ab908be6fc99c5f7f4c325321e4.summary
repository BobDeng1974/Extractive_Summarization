hitler 's first victims and one man 's race for justice by @entity4 one sunny april morning in 1933 , while most people were getting ready for the @entity8 weekend , two men drove through the @entity10 countryside , towards the pretty little town of @entity12			1
one was @entity13 , a 39 - year - old veteran of @entity14 , a serious , conservative , religious man , who worked as a deputy prosecutor in @entity18			1
the other was @entity20 , the district ’s forensic examiner , another war veteran and a similarly quiet , serious man			2
they were on their way to investigate the deaths of four men , who had been found shot on the dreary moorland outside @entity12			1
it might sound like the premise for a sunday - night crime drama but , as @entity4 shows in this frighteningly compelling book , the murders marked the beginning of the darkest chapter in human history			1
on the morning that @entity13 and @entity38 set off from @entity18 , the @entity39 had been in power for barely two - and - a - half months			1
yet since @entity42 ’s appointment as @entity44 ’s chancellor on january 30 , he had wasted barely a minute			1
almost immediately , the @entity39 began taking over every institution they could lay their hands on , from the police and the judiciary to universities and football clubs			0
this photo from the early 1930s shows the commandant of @entity12 concentration camp inspecting newly arrived inmates after an arson attack on the @entity56 in february , @entity42 forced through emergency legislation scrapping civil liberties and , a month later , he secured an @entity59 allowing him to rule by decree			1
already , @entity44 was becoming a dictatorship — in @entity4 ’s words , the @entity39 ‘ were no longer intruders in the system ; they were becoming the system ’			1
as the men drove through the april sunshine , few could have imagined the depths to which the new regime would sink			2
@entity13 himself was no bleeding - hearted liberal : in the aftermath of @entity14 , he had briefly served in the right - wing @entity72 , fighting revolutionaries in the streets of @entity18			1
but when he got to the scene of the shootings , just outside @entity12 ’s new concentration camp for political prisoners ( supposedly in ‘ protective custody ’ ) , he knew at once that something was terribly wrong			1
the four bodies belonged to camp inmates , who had supposedly been shot from a distance while trying to escape			1
they had been unceremoniously dumped in a shed , ‘ like slain game ’ , instead of being treated with the respect due to the dead			0
further , when dr @entity20 knelt to examine the bodies , he could see at once that they had actually been shot from close range			2
there was , @entity13 wrote many years later , an atmosphere of intolerable dread in the camp , a former munitions factory			1
on his way out , he recalled : ‘ a terrified young man pressed through the crowd			0
he was sobbing and told me that he was afraid he was going to be murdered			0
’ @entity13 tried to calm him down			1
no one was going to be killed , he said			0
then , he and @entity20 drove back to @entity18			0
on the way , the prosecutor told his colleague he had been shocked by the attitude of the camp commandant , a boorish @entity107 man			0
he had also noticed something that worried him			0
all of the four men were @entity110			1
today , when the @entity39 ’ crimes have become part of the world ’s moral inheritance , it takes a bit of effort to reconstruct the atmosphere of early 1933 , when many still hoped that — given time — @entity42 ’s regime would evolve towards moderate respectability			1
@entity13 and @entity38 were very far from being natural rebels			2
yet , in the next few weeks , as more reports of mysterious deaths and ‘ suicides ’ crossed the prosecutor ’s desk , he began to realise he was dealing with something genuinely monstrous			0
these were not accidents or aberrations : they were the inevitable result of a regime that had elevated violent brutality into a governing ideology			0
to take one horrifying example from the end of may 1933 : @entity13 was notified about the death of a @entity18 salesman , @entity141 , who had apparently killed himself in his cell			1
however , when dr @entity20 conducted his own forensic examination , he reported to @entity145 that he had found poor @entity141 lying in a pool of his blood			0
far from having killed himself , @entity141 had almost certainly been whipped and strangled by the @entity107 , who ’d then slashed his wrists with a bread knife to make it look like suicide			0
for @entity13 , there could scarcely have been a better example of the @entity39 ’ bestiality			2
the great strength of @entity4 ’s book is that , although the story of the @entity163 is now almost mind - numbingly familiar , his single - minded focus on @entity13 ’s investigation of @entity12 gives it the feel and pace of a courtroom thriller			1
as it approaches its climax , you almost believe this dogged , decent man is going to win through and bring the camp commanders to justice			0
but though @entity13 managed to get the authorities to dismiss the commandant and impose a new , more media - friendly regime at the camp , the momentum towards bloodshed was unstoppable			1
history , unfortunately , is not a @entity182 novel			0
one brave man , acting almost alone , could do little against the apparatus of the @entity163 state			0
it is true that there was no direct link between the killings at @entity12 , which probably resulted from casual cruelty and bullying rather than a deliberate policy of extermination , and the industrialised horrors of the @entity195			2
even so this superbly researched and tautly written little book is a chilling reminder that , from small crimes , far bigger ones can grow			0
it is also a moving tribute to the courage of a decent man who , motivated by his basic faith in law and order , tried to stand up and say ‘ no ’			0
happily , @entity13 survived the @entity163 and died in 1984 at the splendid age of 91			2
his friend and colleague dr @entity20 was not so lucky			0
having been transferred to another post , he died in 1934 in mysterious circumstances			0
@entity13 heard rumours that the @entity107 had somehow been involved			2
‘ by then , ’ writes @entity4 , ‘ there was no one left with the courage or determination to investigate			2

in 1933 , four men were murdered in @entity12 , @entity44
the four bodies belonged to @entity110 inmates of the concentration camp
it marked the beginning of the darkest chapter in human history
@entity4 ’s book focuses on @entity13 ’s investigation into @entity12
