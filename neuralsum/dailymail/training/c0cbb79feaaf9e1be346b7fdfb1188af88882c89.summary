by @entity1 reporter published : 17:18 est , 27 november 2012 updated : 03:27 est , 28 november 2012 @entity3 ambassador @entity2 has apologized for not calling the attacks on the @entity6 consulate in @entity7 , @entity8 , terrorist			1
the comments came after she failed to win over her harshest @entity12 critics in the @entity13 during a meeting with them on tuesday			2
she claimed she never meant to mislead the @entity6 people , and instead used talking points given to her by the intelligence community at the time			1
@entity21 has been named as the likely successor to @entity23 as secretary of state , however , several @entity12 senators are threatening to block her confirmation if president @entity26 nominates her for any post			1
' we explained that the talking points provided by the intelligence community , and the initial assessment upon which they were based , were incorrect in a key respect : there was no protest or demonstration in @entity7 , ' ms. @entity2 said			1
she added : ' we stressed that neither i , nor anyone else in the administration , intended to mislead the @entity6 people at any stage in this process , and the administration updated @entity60 and the @entity6 people as our assessments evolved			2
' the @entity12 said that they remain unconvinced by her responses and said her visit left them with greater concerns than before the meeting			2
they have openly criticized her for initial comments after the september 11 attack on the @entity6 mission in @entity7 that suggested it was a spontaneous event arising from protests of an anti-islam film rather than a premeditated attack			2
conflict : the outcry by @entity12 may cost @entity21 the nomination as secretary of state @entity6 ambassador to @entity8 @entity77 and three other @entity6 were killed in the attack on the @entity7 mission and a nearby @entity43 annex			1
intelligence officials later said the attack was possibly tied to @entity84 affiliates			0
@entity32 said : ' we are significantly troubled by many of the answers that we got , and some that we did n't get , concerning evidence that was overwhelming leading up to the attack on our consulate ... it is clear that the information that she gave the @entity6 people was incorrect when she said that it was a spontaneous demonstration triggered by a hateful video			2
' he added : ' it was not , and there was compelling evidence at the time that that was certainly not the case , including statements by @entity8 as well as other @entity6 who are fully aware that people do n't bring mortars and rocket - propelled grenades to spontaneous demonstrations			2
' @entity34 said : ' i 'm more disturbed now than i was before			0
i think it does not do justice to the reality at the time and in hindsight clearly was completely wrong ...			0
in real time , it was a statement disconnected from reality			0
' @entity35 said she had ' many more questions that need to be answered ' and suggested she 'd vote against @entity21 's nomination as secretary of state			1
@entity34 added : ' i would n't vote for anybody being nominated out of the @entity7 debacle until i had answers about what happened that i do n't have today , ' @entity34 said			1
asked whether he would block such a nomination , @entity34 said : ' oh , absolutely			0
i would place a hold on anybody that wanted to be promoted for any job that had a role in the @entity7 situation			0
' @entity12 have argued that the @entity26 administration tried to play down the terrorist angle in its initial comments to avoid undermining the president 's claims of success in fighting @entity84 in the run - up to the november 6 election			0
@entity21 was accompanied by acting cia director @entity141 and was not seen by reporters			0
@entity26 has defended @entity21 and said if senators have a problem with the administration 's handling of @entity7 they should ' go after me ' rather than try to ' besmirch her reputation			1
' raid : a militant during the assault on the @entity6 @entity151 in @entity7 , @entity8 on september 11th @entity34 also criticized @entity6 intelligence agencies that wrote the talking points on which @entity21 based her public comments			1
' i 'm very disappointed in our intelligence community			0
i think they failed in many ways			0
but with a little bit of inquiry and curiosity , i think it would be pretty clear that to explain this episode as related to a video that created a mob that turned into a riot was far afield , ' he said			0
' and at the end of the day , we 're going to get to the bottom of this			0
' @entity21 's controversial @entity7 statements were based on a set of unclassified talking points prepared by @entity6 intelligence agencies for members of @entity60			1
the initial draft written by the @entity43 referred to ' attacks ' carried out by ' extremists with ties to @entity84			0
' however by the time @entity21 received them , ' attacks ' had changed to ' demonstrations ' and ' with ties to @entity84 ' had been deleted , multiple @entity6 sources have said			1
not budging : @entity188 member , @entity189 @entity35 , says she had ' many more questions that need to be answered ' and suggested she 'd vote against @entity21 's nomination as secretary of state those in intelligence circles suggest the talking points were deliberately vague in order to protect covert operations in @entity8 in the aftermath of the attack , adding that an investigation was still underway when @entity21 made the rounds of talk shows on sept. 16			1
republicans , meantime , suspect @entity21 was covering up for president @entity26 , charging the administration did n't want an @entity84 terrorist attack to taint his re-election chances			0
@entity208 response : @entity26 administration spokesman @entity209 says the questions about @entity21 's talking points have been answered the @entity208 has denied making those edits and members of @entity60 are trying to determine where the changes were made			1
@entity208 spokesman @entity209 said the questions about @entity21 's appearance on the talk shows and the talking points had been answered			1
@entity209 said : ' the focus on - some might say obsession ( with ) - comments made on sunday shows seems to me , and to many , to be misplaced			2
what is the point of the focus on this ? ' @entity21 , a @entity228 scholar who 's married to @entity230 television producer @entity229 , has risen through @entity232 ranks over the years to counsel presidential candidates that include @entity235 and @entity236 , himself a possible @entity23 replacement			1
she has an impressive pedigree - her father was the first black governor of the @entity241 , her mother a renowned education scholar - but @entity21 's legendary abrasiveness has prompted misgivings about her suitability for the job from both the left and right			1
' she is ill - equipped to be the nation 's top diplomat for reasons that have little to do with @entity8 , ' @entity253 , a left - leaning @entity254 columnist , wrote recently in a piece that recounted how she once gave respected diplomat @entity256 the middle finger when she worked in the @entity258			0
he called her an ' undiplomatic diplomat			0
' the @entity261 ' @entity260 , also a liberal columnist , took aim as well , arguing @entity21 's foreign policy stances are primarily motivated by professional ambitions			2

@entity268 , @entity34 and @entity35 says their concerns linger after meeting with @entity2 in @entity271 , on tuesday
they say they would vote against @entity21 if she was nominated to replace @entity23 as secretary of state
@entity6 ambassador @entity77 and three other @entity6 were killed in @entity7 strike - which occurred on 9/11 attacks *anniversary*
@entity208 spokesman @entity209 says all the questions regarding @entity21 's talking points have been answered
