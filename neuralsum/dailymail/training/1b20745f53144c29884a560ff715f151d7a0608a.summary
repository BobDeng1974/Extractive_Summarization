by @entity0 career criminal : @entity2 , 64 , who blames his 501 convictions on a head injury he suffered falling out of a window in 1970 @entity7 's ' most prolific thief ' has walked free from court despite clocking up crime number 501 after five decades of offending			1
@entity2 , 64 , claims his incredible criminal career started in 1970 because his personality changed when he fell out of a window and banged his head			1
the shoplifter says he is now a ' kleptomaniac ' and simply can not stop himself			2
over the years , @entity2 has targeted dozens of shops in his hometown of @entity19 and even once took his unsuspecting wife on a shoplifting expedition during a sightseeing coach trip			1
@entity2 was hauled before @entity23 again yesterday after his latest spate of thefts in april and may			1
the court heard he snatched £ 203 of clothes from a fashion store in @entity19 , @entity29 , £ 295 of perfume from boots , toiletries worth £ 350 from @entity33 , and £ 8 of chocolate from @entity35 in @entity29			1
he also walked into a branch of the @entity37 in @entity39 town centre and asked staff if the shop sold any expensive perfume - then stole the £ 42 gift set pointed out to him by a store assistant			2
@entity2 , from @entity45 , @entity19 , admitted five charges of theft over his £ 900 spree and admitted : ' i 'm ashamed of myself '			1
he was given a four - month prison sentence , suspended for 18 months after @entity51 told him : ' we want to help you ' , to the fury of his victims			1
after the case @entity56 , 52 , manager of the @entity35 in @entity29 which was raided by @entity2 said : ' this guy should be in prison not get wrapped up in cotton wool and molly - coddled by some probation officer			1
' shoplifters cause us nothing but misery and at this guy 's age , a leopard is never going to change his spots			0
' i just can not understand how someone can get off scot fee when he 's committed over 500 offences			0
what more does it take to get locked up ? ' we get loads of shoplifters coming in stealing toiletries because they see this crime as easy to do and knowing they 'll probably get a soft sentence if they are caught			1
' we lose on average at least £ 100 a month because of crime - maybe more and its causes us all sorts of economic problems			1
giving this man help rather than prison just sends out the wrong message - and tells people shoplifting is not taken seriously			1
' the court was told that over the last 43 years , @entity2 had 416 convictions for theft , seven offences of violence , four sexual offences , two offences against property , 28 relating to police courts and spells in prison , three drug offences and 36 ' miscellaneous ' crimes			1
the record is thought to make him @entity7 's worst offender			0
in 1996 his offending became so prolific his long - suffering wife @entity106 , then 46 , spoke out to condemn an 18 - week stretch he received for stealing cigarettes , spirits and groceries			2
anger : @entity56 , manager of the @entity114 store @entity2 targeted in @entity29 , said the criminal should be sent to prison rather than ' molly - coddled by some probation officer ' she said : ' he should have got at least 18 months			1
the only way he will stop is by being in prison			0
if he 's in there long enough he might stop and think and get some proper help while he 's locked up			2
' when he 's out after short stretches its just too easy for him to go and do it again			0
a psychiatrist has told me that he 's a kleptomaniac , i do n't think there 's much doubt about that			2
' but although she vowed to stand by her man , in 2008 mrs @entity130 was unwittingly caught up in another thieving expedition when she and her husband went to @entity134 , @entity135 , for a day out by a coach - to celebrate his release from another prison stretch			2
while browsing around the shops in the historic market town , light - fingered @entity2 helped himself to more than £ 1,000 worth of jewellery from two shops after telling staff he had won the @entity144			1
he then took jumpers and biscuits while waiting at @entity148 shop for his wife to meet up with him			0
@entity150 : @entity2 admitted stealing £ 8 of chocolate from the @entity152 in @entity29 as his tally of convictions hit 501 @entity150 : @entity2 asked staff in the @entity37 , @entity39 if they sold any expensive perfume - then stole the £ 42 gift set pointed out to him by a store assistant @entity150 : @entity37 targeted by @entity2 is in @entity159 , @entity39 ( pictured ) in mitigation , his lawyer @entity160 said : ' all this behaviour is impulsive or compulsive			1
there 's no planning , he goes straight into the shop , picks up a select three or four items then walks out			0
' there 's no violence or damage to the shop			0
there are many many convictions of shoplifting but there is no violence or damage and normally items are recovered all of the time			2
' he said the defendant 's personality changed after an accident in 1970			0
' he decided to attend a family function and the windows were open , they were the type you could pull up			0
he fell out backwards and it was n't a ground floor window			0
' that has changed his personality			0
a psychologist is going to be most help to him			0
' he does n't steal from vulnerable victims - every time it is a large retailer - like boots and @entity197			0
he has a long suffering sister who has supported him			0
his sister does his shopping			0
he does not want to go to shops and be around temptation			0
' chairman of the magistrates @entity205 also ordered @entity2 to comply with a electronic curfew between 10am and 5pm for six months and to pay an £ 80 victim surcharge			1
mr @entity208 told @entity2 : ' it 's up to you now , we want to help you			2
