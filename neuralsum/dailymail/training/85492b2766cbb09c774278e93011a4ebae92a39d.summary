by @entity0 published : 23:27 est , 14 february 2013 updated : 07:46 est , 15 february 2013 six water companies are accused of exploiting a loophole that wipes out tax due on billions of pounds of loans some of @entity6 's biggest water companies are controversially using tax havens to avoid paying millions in @entity6 tax , a new investigation claims today			1
six of them , including @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , are accused of exploiting a loophole that wipes out tax due on billions of pounds of loans			1
the arrangements have emerged as water regulator @entity20 announced last week that water bills would rise by 3.5pc to an average of £ 388 - a - year per household			1
controversial schemes taken by big firms to slash their tax bills are the centre of attention at the moment after mps slammed @entity32 giants like @entity33 and @entity34 as ' immoral '			2
the government has announced new plans to clamp down on firms who push their revenues abroad out of the grasp of the taxman			2
they will be prevented from winning lucrative @entity43 contracts			2
companies bidding for government contracts will have to provide details of their tax compliance history , including tax returns that have been judged incorrect , under the draft new rules announced yesterday			2
proposals to change the law come as water firms @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity54 , @entity14 , @entity55 and @entity56 and @entity57 were thrust into the spotlight over their tax affairs			1
an investigation by lobby group @entity61 shows all have taken big loans from investors which they are allowed to offset against their profits – the figure over which corporation tax is calculated			1
while we already knew firms reduced their tax bill by doing this we did not know that they had also found a way to avoid paying tax on the interest payments made on these loans			2
normally when a @entity6 company pays interest to a @entity79 company it has to withhold 20pc of the payments and give it to the taxman			0
but investors in the water companies have found a way round this by using a complex tax scheme			1
they issued their loans through the @entity90 stock exchange as something called ' quoted @entity92 ' which means they do not have to pay the tax on the interest due to a loophole			0
@entity96 , which is based in @entity97 , @entity98 , confirmed the interest payments on its £ 310million of quoted eurobonds from its owners are tax - deductible @entity61 has found some of the £ 1billion in loans made to @entity106 , which is controlled by @entity108 billionaire @entity107 , were listed on the @entity109			1
it paid £ 50million in interest on this for six month in 2011/12 and is due to pay £ 100million for the following year , @entity61 says			1
this means it has saved paying the @entity6 government £ 30million in tax on the interest			0
@entity116 , which is owned by investment funds based in the @entity32 , @entity6 and @entity118 and @entity119 , accrued £ 66million in interest payments on £ 844million of quoted eurobonds in 2012 , @entity61 says			1
this , together with the interest payments on its other debt , helped it pay just £ 100,000 in corporation tax on an operating profit of £ 335million in 2012			0
@entity96 , which is part owned by @entity130 's @entity129 , nicknamed the ' @entity131 ' for its huge payouts to shareholders , confirmed the interest payments on its £ 310million of quoted eurobonds from its owners are tax - deductible			0
combined with its other debt , these helped the company wipe out an operating profit of £ 577million , meaning it received a tax credit in 2012			0
it said : ' our operational performance			0
this is the result of higher - than - ever levels of investment			0
meanwhile our customers ' bills remain the second - lowest in the country			0
' it was a similar story at @entity152 , @entity56 and @entity57 and @entity153 who all declined to comment .			0

claims follow an investigation by lobby group @entity61
