by @entity0 a street light has finally been turned off - after being left on 24 hours a day for six years			2
the faulty lamp in @entity3 was fixed by council engineers after angry residents complained			1
local resident @entity6 , 64 , said : ' it ’s been shining into my house 24/7 for six years			1
what a waste of money over all that time			0
@entity6 stands underneath the street light that shone directly into her bedroom window 24 hours a day for six years before the council finally fixed it ' i live in a semi-detached and the light would shine straight in to my bedroom window			1
i have n’t been very well recently and when i ’d sit in the room and look out of the window all i could see was the bright light			1
' it ’s been on for six solid years day and night			0
i ’ve told the council over the years and they said they would sort it , but i think it just got put to the bottom of the pile			2
' @entity29 , from @entity30 based company @entity28 , estimated keeping the light going for six years would have cost about £ 920			2
mrs @entity6 said she mentioned the problem to the council again in may and ' they agreed it was a waste '			1
she added : ' again they said they would sort it out , but they never did			0
the offending street light that was fixed this week in @entity3			0
the @entity41 said they were unaware of the problem and sent an engineer to fix it as soon as they were informed ' i stopped asking after a while because you start to feel like you ’re being ignored			1
it was only when i saw the council ’s plans to leave streets without light to save money that i thought i needed to do something			2
' it just got me really riled up when i saw the plans and i thought how can they leave these people without light when this one is never switched off ? ' a spokesman for @entity41 said : ' this was the first we heard about a problem with this light but an engineer has been out and fixed it			1
' although we carry out regular checks on street lighting at night , we need members of the public to report lights which are on at the wrong times so we can repair them			0
' the spokesman said the council looked after an ' enormous amount of lights ' in the county and had ' never heard of ' a light being faulty for so long			1
the @entity79 director @entity78 said : ' unlike the streetlight , the council needs to switch on to the fact that taxpayers will no longer tolerate poor service			0
' the amount of taxpayers ' money that 's been wasted on the 24/7 streetlight will rub salt in the wound			0
councils have to be more responsive when local residents complain			0

@entity6 was *blinded* by light that shone into her bedroom window
*numerous* complaints to the @entity41 were ignored
the council said they had never heard of a light being faulty for so long
