‘ the compliance officer has found that claims made by ms @entity3 were outside the scheme , and that these claims should be repaid			2
ms @entity3 has subsequently repaid these claims			2
’ the three allegations included : the report said ms @entity3 did not contest the details of her travel claims but said she outlined several explanations for the other allegations , including family commitments and family illness , and an elderly pet dog			2
jungle : the @entity14 mp was suspended from the @entity4 after appearing on @entity80 without asking for permission outlining ms @entity3 ' evidence , the report said : ‘ whilst undertaking her parliamentary duties , the mp and a dependent family member used the premises during the period when utility bills increased			1
‘ ms @entity3 is a single parent with an elderly pet dog and a dependent family			2
during the period subject of the complaint , the mp returned to her constituency home to attend to family commitments , including times when a family member and the pet dog suffered illness			0

’ it added : ‘ ms @entity3 believes that she has acted within the principles of the scheme and that there has been no deliberate wrongdoing			2
’ the outspoken backbencher has already announced she will no longer claim expenses in a statement posted on her website , ms @entity3 questioned why @entity24 had chosen to carry out an ‘ expensive and time - consuming investigation into my expenses ’			1
and the mp , who was suspended from the @entity121 after she appeared on tv 's i 'm a celebrity ... @entity123 ! , added : ‘ i am sure it is just a coincidence that , as the pressure began to mount for my whip to be returned after three months of suspension , wham , i surprisingly had an investigation in process			1
‘ any request for reinstatement met with the response from the chief whip ( sir @entity134 ) : ' we now have to wait for the @entity24 investigation to end '			0
’ ms @entity3 said she was ‘ delighted ’ that @entity24 had made no findings against her , noting that she could have legitimately made more claims than she had			1

‘ anyway , as everyone knows , i have removed myself from the personal expenses system			0
i shall use my salary to fund my second home in @entity12 and my travel and all other personal expenses , which in effect means i shall be working for free , ’ she said			0
‘ when we had the expenses crisis in 2009 , the problem was never who paid the expenses , it was expenses			0

commons watchdog issues ruling on @entity14 mp
reveals ' unusual ' pattern of trips to her second home
@entity178 was suspended from @entity4 party for taking part in i 'm a celebrity ...
has *vowed* to stop claiming commons expenses altogether
an increase in utility claims over a three - month period during spring and summer 2012 , which the report said raised questions as to whether costs had been incurred ‘ *necessarily* and wholly with respect to the mp 's parliamentary functions ’ , which @entity24 said required an explanation .
ms @entity3 ' occupancy of her second home , funded by @entity24 , was considered to be ‘ *significantly* less ’ than other @entity21 , raising questions as to whether she should be considered ‘ *routinely* *resident* ’ as required by the rules .
@entity209 return journeys to ms @entity3 ' @entity14 constituency while her second home was available also raised questions in *mr* @entity36 ' report .
