former president @entity0 said in a rare tv interview broadcast @entity2 that he was shocked to learn @entity4 dictator @entity3 expected him to back down from their 2003 standoff that preceded a massive @entity8 invasion			1
' you know , when he was captured , i was told that the @entity12 agent that talked to him – he said , " i just did n't believe @entity0 " , ' he told @entity14 newsman @entity13 sunday morning			1
' and it 's hard for me to believe he did n't believe me			2
' ' we 'd given an ultimatum to the @entity18 and delivered , ' @entity0 said			1
' i make the point in the book , of course , that -- and @entity22 understood this better than anybody -- that when you say something as president , you better mean it			0
' that line is already being interpreted on @entity29 and elsewhere as a veiled slap at president @entity31 , whose ' red line ' ultimatums leveled at @entity34 and @entity35 have been seen globally as tentative and toothless			1
former president @entity0 appeared sunday for a rare tv interview with @entity14 newsman @entity13 on ' @entity37 ' ' i just did n't believe @entity0 , ' @entity4 dictator @entity3 reportedly told @entity8 interrogators after his capture , a revelation that left @entity0 ' 43 ' surprised ' words mean something			1
... i thought i was pretty clear at times during my presidency and meant it , ' @entity0 said sunday			2
' @entity3 did n't believe us			1
' ' it was hard in retrospect for me to look back and say , " i do n't see how he could doubt my word "			0
' the interview aired on @entity14 during a day when the network was marking the 60th anniversary retrospective of the program ' @entity37			1
' @entity0 's new book , ' 41 : a portrait of my father , ' will ship on tuesday			2
it 's a portrait of president @entity59 , who served a single term in the @entity61 before losing the job to @entity63 in 1992			0
the younger @entity0 kept the book project close to his vest for years			2
the @entity66 reported sunday that it includes a probing analysis of his father 's decision to invade @entity4 the first time around			1
but he insists in the book that his 2003 @entity72 battles with @entity3 were n't son 's homage to his dad			1
' i was not trying " to finish what my father had begun , " as some have suggested , ' he writes			2
@entity59 had driven @entity4 forces loyal to @entity3 out of @entity79 but allowed them a safe retreat to @entity81			1
@entity0 swooped in to finish the job after @entity84 terrorists struck @entity85 and the @entity86 in 2001			1
' i went in there as a result of a very changed environment because of september the 11th			0
and the danger we were concerned about was that the weapons ... would be put into the hands of terrorist groups that would come and make the attacks of 9/11 pale in comparison			0
' he included an explanation in his book , @entity0 said sunday , because he ' was just responding to , kind of , the gossip that tends to work around the political circles – that " clearly he had only one thing in mind and that was to finish the job his father did n't , " because my dad decided not to go into @entity81 after routing @entity3 out of @entity79			1
' the younger @entity0 preceded @entity31 in @entity8 's highest office , and saw his @entity86 's hard - fought gains in the region reversed by troop pullouts from both @entity112 and @entity4			1
he said sunday that he has no regrets about sending @entity8 servicemen and women into a brutally fought and protracted war			2
' i think it was the right decision , ' he told @entity13			0
@entity31 's troop withdrawals at the end of 2011 have been blamed widely for the rise of @entity121 , the self - proclaimed @entity121 , which swarmed into the spaces left by @entity8 's departure			1
@entity0 appeared sunday in a rare tv interview , discussing @entity4 policy , his new biography of his father , and the chances his younger brother @entity127 might make a @entity61 run of his own ' @entity131 ' : president @entity0 addressed the nation aboard the nuclear aircraft carrier @entity135 in may 2003 after what he called a ' victory in a war on terror ' after @entity3 's ouster – but @entity31 would later roll back those gains by withdrawing all @entity8 troops from @entity4 @entity3 ? @entity121 leader @entity143 , shown preaching in a @entity144 , has become public enemy no. 1 in @entity4 and @entity34 , fueled by the absence of dominating @entity8 power in the region @entity121 now controls nearly two - thirds of both @entity4 and @entity34 , by some estimates			1
@entity0 suggested sunday that it did n't have to be that way			2
' my regret is that a violent group of people have risen up again , ' the former president said			1
' this is " @entity84 - plus			1
" i put it in the book , they need to be defeated			0
and i hope we do			0
i hope that the strategy works			0
' @entity0 also commented on talk of his younger brother @entity127 , a former @entity166 governor , making a run for the presidency in what would be a precedent - setting three - peat for the bush family if he were successful			2
@entity127 is ' wrestling with the decision , ' he said			0
' i think it 's 50 - 50			0
' ' he and i are very close , ' offered the former president			0
' on the other hand , he 's not here knocking on my door , you know , agonizing about the decision			0
he knows exactly , you know , the ramifications on family , for example			0
he 's seen his dad and his brother go through the presidency			0
i 'd give it a tossup			0
' he said he would be ' all in ' to support his brother if he runs , and would accept a behind - the - scenes role if that 's what was asked of him			0
former first lady @entity193 has gone on record saying that enough @entity195 have already run for president			0
' sometimes her prognostications have n't been very accurate , ' @entity0 said .			2

@entity0 insists he did n't invade @entity4 in 2003 to finish what his father started
ultimatum to @entity3 was serious , he told @entity203 – ' when you say something as president , you better mean it '
that line was a veiled slam on president @entity31 , whom he also slapped over the rise of @entity121 in @entity4 where the @entity8 *military* once dominated
' my regret is that a violent group of people have risen up again , this is " @entity84 - plus " '
@entity218 came on @entity14 during a 60th - year fete for ' @entity37 ' show
