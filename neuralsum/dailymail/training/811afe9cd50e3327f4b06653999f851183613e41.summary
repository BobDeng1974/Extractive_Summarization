by @entity0 published : 06:58 est , 7 november 2012 updated : 04:33 est , 8 november 2012 an aristocratic couple who live on a tiny island off the @entity4 coast have sold their home for £ 1million after years of fighting to ban stag and hen parties			1
after more than a decade , @entity9 and @entity10 are moving out of their home on @entity12 , which is connected to the mainland in @entity14 by a 100ft crossing			1
the only house in the @entity18 with its own suspension bridge , it went on the market two years ago and has now been snapped up by a buyer who does not currently live in the area			1
they believe it will continue to be used as a family home			2
@entity49 - once said to be the world ’s smallest inhabited isle - is completely surrounded by water at high tide , offering spectacular views on all sides			2
but the couple soon found themselves at odds with @entity14 's famous party culture , which sees drunken revellers having public sex and people taking drugs on the beach			1
lady @entity65 has spent years campaigning against the hundreds of revellers who hold parties on beaches at the foot of the 80ft rock			1
@entity72 is a mecca for stag and hen dos and @entity10 once threatened to sue the local council for not doing enough to stop the late - night celebrations			1
@entity10 wrote to @entity78 to complain about the parties in summer 2003 - during which there were two reported rapes in one week			1
sad farewell : lord and @entity10 say they growing old and can no longer negotiate the slippery steps and swaying bridge crackdown : lady @entity65 wrote a four - page letter to the council insisting that the mayhem had to stop she had earlier asked the authority if she could extend the bungalow so she could build a quieter bedroom facing away from the beach , but had been refused			1
in a four - page letter , @entity10 - whose husband was a @entity97 whip in the @entity98 and @entity99 years - told the council that it had a duty to bring the mayhem on the beach to an end			1
many in the town were shocked by the negative publicity but others agreed with the @entity43 and formed the @entity110 to get the place cleaned up			2
@entity10 said : ' we are not moving because of any problems with the beach			0
these have been sorted out and have largely been stopped			0
' it has changed out of all recognition since 2003			0
it is now illegal to start bonfires on the beach , sell alcohol or for excessive numbers to congregate there at night			0
view of the beach : in the early 2000s , the beach used to be the home of much partying , where naked revellers would run squealing into the surf , bonfires would be lit and couples would have sex in public life in the sun : the @entity43 say they understand the house will remain a family home ' putting a stop to it has done @entity14 a huge amount of good			1
the reason we ’re moving is because the steps leading to the house are very uneven and slippery			2
' the couple put the house on the market after 83 - year - old @entity148 began finding the granite steps either side of the swaying @entity152 bridge too much			1
they have now sold their 1930s , three - bedroom home - one of the most photographed in the country - and are due to move out on friday november 30			1
@entity10 says the move is down to the home being difficult to access for her 83 - year - old husband @entity148			1
she said : ' it has been a wonderful place to live			0
the view is absolutely fantastic and it ’s a fun house to live in			2
keen for privacy ? this is the view across the 100ft long suspension bridge which sits 90ft off the ground			2
the path has become hard for the elderly couple to negotiate uplifting sight : the picturesque house is said to be one of the most photographed in the country ' it ’s also been very nice meeting people in the community			1
i understand it will remain a family home			2
it ’s certainly not being sold for anything else			0
' it ’s difficult for my husband to carry things up and down			0
it ’s getting too much for him now			0
' we ’re moving somewhere where we can drive up to the door			0
as of yet we have n’t found anywhere that fits the bill			0
' but anyone thinking of moving here must understand it is a lively place			0
we are certainly not prudes			0
' @entity10 once applied to the @entity195 to have @entity12 , has less than 50 residents , officially recognised as the world ’s smallest island			0
but officials ruled it does not qualify because it is technically an outcrop .			0

lady @entity65 wrote four - page letter to council asking for action to stop *debauched* *beachfront* revelry
her house stands on an 80ft rock connected to @entity14 by bridge
the three - bed , 1930s home is one of the most photographed in the @entity18
lord @entity214 , 83 , was a @entity97 whip in the @entity98 and @entity99 years
