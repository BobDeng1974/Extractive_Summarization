by @entity0 an @entity3 film director 's latest project has been surrounded by an eerie case of life imitating art , as it is based around a plane crash on a @entity8 - bound flight			1
@entity9 , who is best known for his film @entity11 , is in the early stages of production for action / adventure movie @entity14 , as the air search for missing @entity19 flight @entity16 continues			1
it 's not the first time one the director 's films has mirrored a real life disaster , and two weeks before @entity11 's release ( a film about an underwater cave diving expedition gone wrong ) , @entity3 was hit by disastrous floods			1
cinematic coincidences : @entity3 filmmaker @entity9 is directing @entity14 , pictured at @entity29 in 2012 now @entity14 will follow the fates of passengers who survive a plane crash on a @entity34 - bound flight			1
the @entity36 - based filmmaker said he could n't deny the strange timing between his project and the real - life drama of the missing @entity40			0
but despite saying it was ' mysterious ' , he insists that his film is vastly different			0
he told @entity43 : ' the similarities and timing is interesting and i can see why anecdotally the two things link up , it 's a tricky thing			1
' but in simple terms , @entity14 is about an accident that happens on an airplane which goes down in the ocean , and the survivors trying to stay alive afterwards			0
' it 's more complicated than that as there 's villains and sharks , but it 's a fun action / adventure with thrills and spills and scares			1
flashback film : ( @entity64 ) @entity9 , @entity65 and @entity66 on the set of @entity11 in 2011 ' nobody knows what has happened with the @entity71 airplane			2
we 're yet to find out whether it will be revealed as a malfunction or even found			0
' @entity9 and @entity3 production company @entity75 began pre-production on @entity14 at @entity78 in @entity79 weeks before the real - life incident			2
he said it will be some two years before the film hits cinemas , allowing enough plenty of space between the true story currently unfolding			0
it 's not the first time the veteran filmmaker has had life imitate art. his first big budget feature sanctum - executive produced by @entity93 filmmaker @entity65 - was two weeks out from release when @entity79 and @entity95 were hit by devastating floods in 2011			1
' the floods came through and destroyed whole areas , with people losing their lives , ' he said			0
@entity11 scares : a scene from @entity9 's underwater thriller ' we had this weird situation where we were about to release a film where there 's flooding and people drown			2
' it was strange territory			0
' @entity9 said @entity14 is shaping up to be a co-production with @entity8 , who also worked with the same @entity3 crew on kitsch shark thriller bait with @entity115 and @entity116			2
' we 've nicknamed it bait 2 because there 's a lot of the same crew and even themes , but it 's a stand alone story			0
' his next project @entity124 - about the real - life story of @entity3 war photographer @entity127 - goes to air on april 27 on @entity128			0
meanwhile , search planes flying deep into the @entity131 this weekend found nothing that could be from the missing @entity19 jet after a second day scanning the seas , @entity3 's acting prime minister said on saturday			1
the planes are part of an international effort to solve the nearly two - week - old mystery of what happened to flight mh370 which vanished with 239 people on board			0
mystery goes on : the @entity19 flight has been missing for two weeks now ( stock image of a @entity19 plane )			1

deep water action film deals with plane missing en route to @entity34
eerie similarities to *commercial* passenger *aircraft* @entity16
flight goes missing in same area as search *zone*
director 's film sanctum also followed a cave diving expedition gone wrong as @entity3 was hit by disastrous floods in 2011
