by @entity1 reporter last updated at 12:29 pm on 29th june 2011 @entity3 's re-election bid has come under fire after a campaigner hinted he may include dinner cooked by @entity8 chef @entity7 as a way of raising money			1
the idea was suggested as a possible fund - raising measure by @entity13 - a junior campaign manager - who hoped to arrange a food tasting that would feature a number of local chefs			0
the controversy comes after a video for an upcoming fund raiser was allegedly shot at the @entity8 , leading commentators to criticise the president for his ' poor taste ' in choosing the venue to serve as a campaign backdrop			1
in march , @entity3 met with financial leaders and executives in the @entity50 of the @entity8 - with most of those present being past campaign contributors to the president			1
speaking to @entity55 about the video and earlier meeting , @entity53 , vice president of communications for @entity54 , said : ' it looks bad			1
' it â€™s disappointing that a president who has gone further than most others in terms of putting up firewalls between the @entity8 and special interests , would host in the @entity8 a meeting with past or current donors			1
' responding to the criticism , press secretary @entity67 said there was nothing wrong holding a @entity72 event at the @entity8			2
popular : the president is hugged by another diner ( left ) and also spent time with a younger supporter on the campaign trail : mr @entity3 spoke about the economic recovery on his visit he said : ' it is wholly understandable why the president would want to consult with business executives about their ideas about , you know , what to do in terms of economic policy and business policy going forward , including financial sector policy			1
' the fact that they 're supporters , obviously , he would want to talk to his supporters about that , as well			0
also speaking to @entity55 , @entity94 of @entity95 said : ' it is simply common sense that nothing should be done that would leave the impression that the @entity8 is being used for fund - raising			2
' meetings in the @entity8 should not have any political fund - raising overtones and these kinds of activities ought to be avoided in the future			2
' the controversy comes as the president spoke at @entity109 , an aluminum factory whose products are exported around the world in such high - tech applications as the wings for presidential jet @entity115			0
the plant has re-hired the workers it laid off during the recent recession and is eyeing an expansion , said @entity3			1
@entity3 says the uptick is a sign his economic policies are working			1
but his visit to politically - strategic @entity32 comes amid a run of weak economic indicators that have thrown the strength of @entity129 economic recovery into question			0
@entity129 manufacturing , which had added 134,000 new jobs in the first four months of the year , lost 5,000 jobs in may			0
@entity129 president @entity3 speaks on the economy after touring @entity135 in @entity31 , @entity32 president @entity3 meets with workers on a tour of the @entity109 plant in @entity31 , @entity32 on offer : @entity8 chef @entity7 has been mooted as a possible campaign asset meanwhile , last month 's unemployment rate rose to 9.1 per cent , while consumer confidence fell to 58.5 in june from a revised 61.7 in may			1
the @entity8 believes recovery in the manufacturing industry is one way the @entity129 can create jobs and stay competitive in the global marketplace			2
last week , @entity3 announced a $ 500 million joint effort by industry , universities and the federal government to help reposition the @entity129 as a leader in cutting - edge manufacturing			2
while the president 's re-election hopes in @entity32 , and across the country , are likely to rest on the economy , the chairman of the @entity156 said it comes as no surprise that @entity3 chose the @entity32 for his speech			1
' there 's a famous political saying that " no politician comes to @entity32 by accident			0
" i 'm sure part of this is a political calculation , ' @entity167 said			0
@entity3 's victory in the 2008 @entity32 caucuses thrust him to the head of the @entity72 pack , after which he eventually went on to beat @entity178 @entity177			0
