the world 's population will soar by four billion to reach 11 billion by 2100 , suggests a new study			1
using the latest statistical tools , researchers found that the number of humans on @entity7 is likely to reach 11 billion by the end of the century - around two billion higher than some previous estimates			1
the findings includes the most up - to - date estimates for future world population , as well as a new method for creating such estimates			1
research carried out by @entity16 from @entity17 says the world 's population will increase more than thought ( stock image shown )			1
this latest number is around two billion higher than previous estimates			1
the findings were published online by the journal @entity24 the study 's corresponding author dr @entity25 , a professor of statistics and of sociology at the @entity29 , said : ' the consensus over the past 20 years or so was that world population , which is currently around seven billion , would go up to nine billion and level off or probably decline			1
' we found there 's a 70 per cent probability the world population will not stabilise this century			2
@entity36 , which had sort of fallen off the world 's agenda , remains a very important issue			1
' the paper explains the most recent @entity42 ( @entity42 ) population data released in july			2
it is the first @entity42 population report to use modern statistics , known as bayesian statistics , that combines all available information to generate better predictions			0
most of the anticipated growth is in @entity51 where population is projected to quadruple from around one billion today to four billion by the end of the century			1
there are about seven billion people living on our planet and this number is set to reach almost 10 billion by 2050 , according to @entity42 figures			1
this population explosion is largely attributed to better healthcare and farming practices , with some experts arguing that industrialisation in the 18th and 19th centuries was the tipping point that allowed more humans to thrive			0
however , one social scientist claims the human population explosion has its roots as far back as 2,000 years ago			0
@entity71 , an associate professor of anthropology at @entity74 â€™s @entity73 in @entity75 created a new model of demographic and archaeological data to show when humans thrived			0
in a paper published in the journal @entity81 , he claims that political and economic reforms helped to create more stable families , and therefore enabled more people to thrive			0
the main reason is that birth rates in @entity51 have not dropped as fast as had been previously expected			2
there is an 80 per cent chance that the population in @entity51 at the end of the century will be between 3.5 and 5.1 billion people , according to the study			1
however , other regions of the world are projected to see less change			2
@entity97 , now 4.4 billion , is projected to peak at around five billion people in 2050 and then begin to decline			1
populations in @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and the @entity103 are projected to each stay below one billion			1
the study 's first author @entity105 , a demographer at the @entity42 , said the figures largely support the 2013 @entity42 projections , but add a new dimension			0
he said : ' earlier projections were strictly based on scenarios , so there was no uncertainty			0
' this work provides a more statistically driven assessment that allows us to quantify the predictions , and offer a confidence interval that could be useful in planning			0
' most of the anticipated growth is in @entity51 ( shown ) where population is projected to quadruple from around one billion today to four billion 2100			1
however @entity97 , now 4.4 billion , is projected to peak at around five billion people in 2050 while @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 are projected to each stay below one billion world population projections are based mostly on two things : future life expectancy and fertility rates			1
earlier techniques relied largely on expert opinion for how those trends were expected to change			0
the newer forecast instead uses statistical methods to combine government data and expert forecasts for such things as mortality rates , fertility rates and international migration			0
earlier reports also represented uncertainty by using scenarios in which women would have 0.5 children more or less than the experts ' forecast			0
however , dr @entity25 said that method generates too big a range			0
he said : ' in a given year and country the fertility rate might be half a child higher , but the probability that it would be half a child higher in all countries in all years in the future is very low			0
' the new method uses statistical models to narrow the range , finding an 80 per cent probability that the population in 2100 will be between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion			2
dr @entity25 added : ' this paper brings together the research from the past seven years , and also brings in recent data			0
' we can answer questions about future population growth using standard principles of statistical inference , which has never really been done before			2
' he said rising population could act to exacerbate other world problems - such as climate change , infectious disease and poverty - while the two things that decrease fertility rates are more access to contraceptives and education of girls and women			2
the findings were published online by the journal @entity24 .			0
