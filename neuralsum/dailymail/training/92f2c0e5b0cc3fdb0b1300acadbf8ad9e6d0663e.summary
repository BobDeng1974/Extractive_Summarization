saboteurs attend the planned hunts in a bid to raise awareness of animal cruelty and use two main tactics to throw the hunt off course			0
one tactic is to cover the scent of a fleeing fox by using citronella ( an essential oil ) which stops the hounds from knowing which direction the animal has escaped			0
the other tactic is to use calls - either voice calls , hunting horns or a small handheld device with an mp3 player attached - which calls them away from chasing the fox			0
