by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 celebrates her 35th birthday on saturday and so , keen to get home for that , she did not want to waste time before discussing her future together with @entity8			1
as they chatted on thursday , the subject of travel is bound to have come up because that is likely to be the only obstacle to the continuation of their fledgling player - coach partnership			2
in the wake of his shattering quarter - final defeat to @entity19 , @entity8 made clear that , in principle , he wanted them to continue			1
tough to take : @entity8 crashed out of @entity22 at the quarter - final stage slow start : @entity8 plans to stick with @entity2 despite his @entity22 exit the intention was always that this was a long - term partnership which is having a trial period , not a trial period which might develop into something long - term			1
but the dethroned champion also stated that he needs to go to @entity33 quickly to start preparing for masters level events in @entity35 next month that have now assumed more importance			1
he seemed to suggest allowances could be made in future for @entity2 ’s location , but not at this moment : ‘ i would say it would be more likely that i will go to @entity33 just because of the conditions , ’ he said			1
‘ i am not against changing or going to train in different places but i think for this period , just because of conditions in @entity46 and at the @entity47 , @entity33 is a good place to prepare for that			1
but at other times of the year there is no reason why i could n’t go somewhere else			2
’ time to regroup : @entity8 heads to the @entity35 next for the hard court season @entity2 wants to keep her travelling to a minimum , so it could be she would not hook up with him until before his next scheduled event , the @entity58 in @entity59 which starts on august 4			1
there have been several years in the past — the last two for example — when @entity8 has turned up in @entity64 and @entity46 and treated them like glorified training weeks			1
he acknowledged this needs to change if he is to alter the pattern that has developed of him playing well in @entity68 before turning in a performance of surprising ineptitude in the quarter or semi-finals			0
‘ it ’s been a year since i won an event and the best way to prepare for majors is by winning a lot of matches and i have not done that			1
in @entity72 ( in january ) i did n’t do that , i did n’t do that before the @entity82 , i did n’t win @entity83 ’s			0
‘ it has n’t stopped me from having good runs in the @entity68 but to have great ones it helps if you have a good build - up			0
i lost to @entity89 in @entity90 and @entity91 in @entity92			0
i felt i was playing good tennis for 10 days , moving well , my game was in good shape			0
work to do : @entity2 must hit the practice courts to address @entity8 's slide sinking feeling : @entity8 has not won an event for a year ' then i just had a poor day			1
i do n’t want to over-analyse but i know if i make some improvements , when you have those off - days you can still find a way to win			0
’ the statistics back up his own assertion that he has not improved since last @entity22			0
once the tournament was over last year he was world no 2 and had earned 5,160 ranking points from the start of 2013 , winning four titles			0
this year he has no titles and amassed only 2,290 points			0
his new ranking of @entity114 , to be announced on monday , is falsely depressed by missing the last two months of the season and will likely pick up soon enough , but it shows how far he has left to climb back to the elite group , which is reshuffling itself			0
downward spiral : @entity8 will slip to tenth in the rankings when they are announced on monday ‘ i need to go away for a few days , think about a few things , talk to my team about how i ’m going to get better , ’ he said			1
‘ if you get too down about things you waste time and the @entity47 will come round pretty quickly			2
‘ i need to make sure that when i get back on the practice court my head is clear and i have a clear plan for the next five weeks before i start playing matches again			0
’ assuming he and @entity2 continue , there are two things they must address : his second serve and his mindset going into big matches			1
with @entity136 , the second serve was shored up to the point where even @entity138 could not properly attack it in the @entity22 final			0
problem area : @entity2 needs to work on @entity8 's second serve 1 ) @entity91 - 12,670 pts 2 ) @entity138 - 11,850 finalist : 12,330 winner : 13,130 ( will become world no 1 if he wins @entity22 ) 3 ) @entity147 - 5,770 4 ) @entity148 - 5,620 finalist : 6,100 winner : 6,900 ( will become world no 3 if he reaches final ) 5 ) @entity151 - 4,410 6 ) @entity152 - 3,920 finalist : 4,400 winner : 5,200 ( will become world no 5 if he wins @entity22 ) 7 ) @entity155 - 3,875 8 ) @entity156 - 3,360 9 ) @entity19 - 3,270 finalist : 3,750 winner : 4,550 ( will become world no 8 if he reaches final , world no 5 if he wins @entity22 ) 10 ) @entity8 - 3,040 too often recently it has been wafted in at sub- 80mph , and someone of @entity19 ’s quality made him pay			1
it also appeared that he went into the match assuming or hoping the @entity167 would not play well , despite him having just won at @entity169			0
@entity8 retreated towards his counter-punching ways rather than going forward and seizing the initiative			2
it was a bit like his surprise 2009 semi-final loss to @entity175			0
@entity136 managed to get him to ignore his natural defensive instincts and be more positive , @entity2 was unable to coax him into that on this one occasion and needs to pull off the trick in future			2
as @entity184 commentator @entity183 pointed out on thursday : ‘ i think @entity2 should be given her opportunity but @entity136 had a huge impact			2
' it was n’t necessarily about teaching him new shots but really focusing on the game style and having someone in his corner with the experience and the knowledge to say : “ you ’re doing the right thing			0
” ‘ and the fact that he ’s not there any more , i think is a loss , but let ’s see what happens with @entity2			1
’ knowledge : @entity183 ( left ) says @entity2 should be given a chance			2

@entity8 set to continue with @entity2 as coach despite @entity205 loss
@entity207 has not won an event for a year and needs to stop the rot
@entity8 heads to @entity33 next ahead of the @entity47 later this summer
