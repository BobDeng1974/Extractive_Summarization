for many , self - destructing snapchat messages and wiping their phone when it ’s stolen is the closest they ’ll come to needing to destroy data on a device			1
but , for people who work with highly sensitive documents and official secrets - or are extremely paranoid about protecting their personal data - there is now a range of self - destructing hard drives			1
reminiscent of the gadgets in @entity15 , the drives can be wiped instantly simply by sending a text message - but they come with a spy price tag of £ 1,000 ( $ 1,600 )			1
the @entity19 and @entity20 ( pictured centre and right ) are 2.5 - inch solid state drives , that are controlled using a free smartphone app. when a user loses the drive , they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically			1
an authentication token ( left ) adds an extra level of security there are three self - destructing drives available from @entity36 - based @entity35 , as well as a master @entity37			1
prices start at £ 938 ( $ 1,500 ) , for the @entity40 , while the @entity19 costs £ 967 ( $ 1,560 ) and the top - of - the - range @entity20 costs £ 1,027 ( $ 1,663 )			1
the @entity19 and @entity20 are 2.5 - inch solid state drives ( @entity42 ) , that can be controlled using a free smartphone app available on @entity44 and @entity45			1
the drives each have @entity47 of encrypted storage and can be fitted to computers , or connected externally using a usb port			2
they also have built - in @entity52 , or cellular technology , which means they can receive text messages			0
when a user loses the drive , or wants to permanently delete the data on it , they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed			0
in addition to a text message , the data can be destroyed by turning off the gsm signal , entering a pin too many times incorrectly , removing the drive from a pc , when the battery falls below a certain level , or using an optional authentication token			2
the @entity75 has the same amount of storage and encryption tools as the other two drives , but does n’t come with gsm functions			0
prices start at £ 938 ( $ 1,500 ) , for the @entity40 , while the @entity19 costs £ 967 ( $ 1,560 ) and the top - of - the - range @entity20 costs £ 1,027 ( $ 1,663 )			1
the @entity19 a 2.5 - inch solid state drive ( @entity42 ) , that can be controlled using a free smartphone app available on @entity44 and @entity45			2
more than one smartphone can be linked to a drive , and if the phone is lost or stolen , the connection can be broken using a pin code			0
the drive has @entity47 of encrypted storage and can be fitted to computers , or connected externally using a usb port			0
it also has built - in @entity52 , or cellular technology , which means it can receive text messages			0
when a user loses the drive , or wants to permanently delete the data on it , they send a text to the device and the storage is destroyed automatically			2
the technology is designed to fragment , or scramble , the data , making it impossible to extract or read , plus a built - in security measure stops any attempts made to recover the data			0
in addition to a text message , the data can be destroyed by turning off the gsm signal , entering a pin too many times incorrectly , removing the drive from a pc , when the battery falls below a certain level , or using an optional authentication token			2
this £ 111 ( $ 180 ) token adds an extra level of security and means only the owner can destroy the data			2
after the first year , customers also have to pay an extra £ 29 ( $ 47 ) for a yearly gsm subscription			0
the @entity20 has almost all of the same features as the @entity19 , but has added internal security measures to make the drive even more impenetrable			0
the technology is reminiscent of the gadgets used by @entity135 in @entity15 ( pictured in the 2011 @entity137 film )			0
as a result , the secure drives also come with a spy price tag			0
the @entity40 costs £ 938 ( $ 1,500 ) , the @entity19 costs £ 967 ( $ 1,560 ) and the @entity20 costs £ 1,027 ( $ 1,663 ) and the @entity75 has the same amount of storage and encryption tools as the other two drives , but does n’t come with gsm functions			1
this means the token , pin entry , removal and battery status destruction methods still work , but the data ca n’t be destroyed using a text message			2
@entity35 claims its @entity40 drives are legal in more than 100 countries , and are covered by these country ’s data protection laws			2
the drive ( pictured left ) is designed to fragment , or scramble , the data , making it impossible to extract or read			0
plus a built - in security measure stops any attempts to recover the data			0
in addition to a text , the data can be destroyed by turning off @entity52 signal , entering a pin incorrectly , or using the £ 111 ( $ 180 ) token ( right ) the firm also sells a master @entity37 ( pictured ) , which can be wirelessly connected to up to 50 computers in a network			1
turning the key on the switch automatically wipes the data from all connected computers			1

prices for the kill switch are not listed on the site			1
although the website claims the devices should have been ready by the ‘ second quarter of 2014 ’ , the firm is advising people to sign up for more information about when they will be available			0
@entity195 has contacted the firm for more information .			0

there are three self - destructing drives available from @entity35
prices start at £ 938 and drives can be controlled using a token or an app
sending a text to the drives automatically destroys the data held on it
drives do n’t *explode* , instead , data is scrambled beyond *recognition*
@entity36 - based firm also sells a kill switch that controls *multiple* computers
when a key is turned , all the data on all connected computers is erased
