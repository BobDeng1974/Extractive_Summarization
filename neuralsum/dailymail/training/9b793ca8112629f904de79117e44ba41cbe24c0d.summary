scientists have found a cosmic supermom			0
it 's a galaxy that gives births to more stars in a day than ours does in a year			1
astronomers used @entity8 's chandra x-ray telescope to spot this distant gigantic galaxy creating about 740 new stars a year			1
by comparison , our @entity12 galaxy spawns just about one new star each year			1
the galaxy is about 5.7 billion light years away in the center of a recently discovered cluster of galaxies that give off the brightest x-ray glow astronomers have seen			1
' @entity20 ' rising : this handout illustration provided by @entity8 shows a cosmic supermom galaxy that gives births to more stars in a day than the @entity12 does in a year it is by far the biggest creation of stars that astronomers have seen for this kind of galaxy			1
other types , such as colliding galaxies , can produce even more stars , astronomers said			2
but this is the size , type and age of galaxy that should n't be producing stars at such a rapid pace , said the authors of a study published wednesday in the journal @entity44			2
' it 's very extreme , ' said @entity47 astronomer @entity46 , co-author of the study			0
' it pushes the boundaries of what we understand			1
' the unnamed galaxy - officially known by a string of letters and numbers - is about 3 trillion times the size of our sun , said study lead author @entity59 of the @entity60			1
there 's another strange thing about this galaxy			2
it 's fairly mature , maybe 6 billion years old			1
eyes in the sky : the distant gigantic galaxy was spotted by the @entity68 , which was launched into space in 1999 usually , this kind ' do n't do anything new ... what we call red and dead , ' @entity59 said in an interview			2
' it seems to have come back to life for some reason			2
' because of that back - to - life situation , the team of 85 astronomers has nicknamed the galaxy cluster @entity20 , after the bird that rises from the ashes			1
the galaxy that is producing the stars at a rate of two per day is the biggest and most prominent of many galaxies there			1
it 's ' helping us answer this basic question of how do galaxies form their stars , ' said @entity95 astronomer @entity94 , who was n't part of the study but praised it			2
there 's lots of very hot hydrogen gas between galaxies			0
when that gas cools to below zero , the gas can form stars , @entity59 said			0
but only 10 per cent of the gas in the universe becomes stars , @entity94 said			0
that 's because the energy from black holes in the center of galaxies counteract the cooling			0
there 's a constant ' tussle between black holes and star formation , ' said sir @entity117 , a prominent astrophysicist at the @entity118 in @entity119			0
he was not part of the study , but commented on it during a @entity8 teleconference wednesday			0
in this case , the black hole in the central galaxy seems to be unusually quiet compared to other supermassive black holes , @entity117 said			0
' so it 's losing the tussle , ' he said			0
but this massive burst of star birth is probably only temporary because there 's only so much fuel and limits to how big a galaxy can get , @entity46 said			0
' it could be just a very short - lived phase that every galaxy cluster has and we just got lucky here ' to see it , @entity46 said			0
little sister : by comparison , the @entity12 , pictured above , produces just one star per year			1

unnamed galaxy produces more stars in a day than the @entity12 spawns in a year
thought to be about 6 billion years old , and has appeared to have ' come back to life '
scientist says the galaxy ' pushes the boundaries of what we understand '
