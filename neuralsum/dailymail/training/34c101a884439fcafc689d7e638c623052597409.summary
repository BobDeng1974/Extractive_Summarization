by @entity0 @entity1 : 08:50 est , 17 december 2013 @entity2 : 15:30 est , 17 december 2013 few situations are more dangerous or terrifying than getting stuck on a level crossing as a train hurtles towards you			0
but as these astonishing images show , drivers and pedestrians risk their lives every day with a casual attitude to the dangers provided by a busy level crossing			2
with an astonishing disregard for safety , people run across the tracks as the lights flash and bells sound , while drivers see the lowering barriers and put their foot down , rather than stop			2
@entity27 level crossing in @entity28 is one of the worst in the country for people running stop signals			1
as this jaw - dropping video footage shows , drivers there speed through lowering safety barriers while those on foot simply run and duck under the barriers as they close			1
@entity37 has publicised its footage of such incidents to highlight the problems and risks of taking a chance at a level crossing			2
in the past five years , there have been 60 cases of misuse of the crossing , 20 of which led to prosecutions			0
the footage shows a driver getting out of his van when the level crossing barriers come down on top of his vehicle as he belatedly tries to back away			1
it also highlights reckless pedestrians running across the tracks , cutting through the gap between the barriers or dodging them as they come down			0
foolhardy : a pedestrian skips across the level crossing at @entity27 despite the lights flashing the driver of this van decides to take his chances despite the barrier coming down - right on his van 's roof as the barrier goes down , it picks up some junk from the rear of the van , so the driver stops and jumps out @entity94 , community safety manager for @entity37 , said : ' @entity27 crossing is renowned for serious cases of misuse			1
' we hope that by engaging with motorists and pedestrians we will be able to help them use the crossing correctly			0
' we take level crossing safety very seriously			0

*shocking* @entity105 footage shows pedestrians and drivers risking their lives
one white van man tries to beat the barrier as it lowers onto his vehicle
another car nearly gets stuck there as there 's no room on the other side
pedestrians run under the barriers as they lower , disregarding the danger
footage was shot at @entity27 in @entity28 , known for risk - takers
@entity37 hope the video will teach people to respect level crossings
