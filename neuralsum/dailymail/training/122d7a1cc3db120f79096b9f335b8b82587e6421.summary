by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:30 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 03:58 est , 6 november 2012 fat cats at @entity4 's top companies have defied the financial crisis and awarded themselves pay rises that take average earnings to £ 4million			1
while their basic salaries have remained roughly the same , @entity9 company bosses have benefited from an enormous 27 per cent increase in income thanks to incentive schemes			2
news of their sky - high earnings will frustrate ordinary workers struggling to cope with austerity measures while those at the top continue to enjoy a ' champagne lifestyle '			1
well - off : the highest - paid executives in @entity4 's biggest companies are hardly feeling the pinch , thanks to incentive schemes the steep increase , revealed by @entity28 , is also likely to anger investors who have seen the value of their holdings slashed by disappointing performances at corporate giants			0
the value of long - term incentive plans ( @entity36 ) rose by an average of 81 per cent to £ 938,000 for directors and £ 1.6m for chief executives in the year to june , said the @entity28 report			1
directors ' pay increased by a median of 3.5 per cent , while the value of their bonuses fell by 4.9 per cent , the study found			2
but this deficit was made up by incentive schemes , which are now used by more than 90 per cent of @entity9 firms			0
ltips are usually granted in the form of shares and are closely linked to shareholder returns , with directors typically having to reach a minimum target before any shares are granted			0
backlash : the top earners at @entity9 firms were @entity60 of @entity61 on £ 15.9m , left , and @entity63 boss sir @entity62 on £ 14m , right however , @entity36 are based on comparative performance with competitors , rather than a company 's historical performance , so directors may be paid even if their company 's performance has worsened , @entity28 revealed			1
' whether a reaction to @entity74 pressure , shareholder concerns or a worse than expected business environment , it seems the brakes have been applied to the basic pay growth for @entity9 bosses , ' said @entity80 of @entity28			2
' however , while shareholders will be pleased to see more traditional elements of pay seemingly slowing , these figures show that directors ' earnings can still grow significantly as a result of a complex mix of incentives			1
' @entity91 general secretary @entity90 added : ' directors have proved that executive pay structures are not fit - for - purpose by securing another huge earnings boost , even while ordinary workers suffer flat or even falling wages			1
lucrative year : @entity100 ceo @entity99 , left , and ceo of @entity103 @entity102 , right , both made £ 10.4m ' an 81 per cent increase in long - term incentive plans when the economy is struggling to climb out of a double - dip recession shows just how flawed the so - called performance elements of directors ' remuneration have become			2
' we still have way to go to bring a sense of reality to executive pay and ensure that directors ' pay is aligned with the long - term health of the company rather than simply its share price			1
' unite general secretary @entity121 said : ' while millions of working people are either without work , or having their pay frozen or slashed , @entity4 's boardrooms are finding even more devious ways to squeeze more cash from their companies			2
' wages for many working people have stagnated since 2003 and have fallen in real terms since the recession hit			0
scalps : former @entity136 chief executive @entity135 , left , and @entity138 boss @entity137 , right , left their companies in disgrace this year after rebellions from shareholders and the public ' but the richest have continued to pull ahead			1
the top 10 per cent have 12 times more income than the bottom 10 per cent			0
scandalously , @entity4 has the fastest growing income inequality compared to other developed countries			0
' what is particularly sickening is that some of the companies may be performing poorly - but the cash registers are always ringing for these directors			0
' ' flawed ' : @entity91 general secretary @entity90 said directors ' pay should be aligned with the long - term health of the company unison general secretary @entity156 said : ' the government is guilty of allowing the gap between the rich at the top and those at the bottom to grow			1
it has used the recession to hold down wages in the public sector and cut jobs and services , while those at the top continue to enjoy a champagne lifestyle			0
' it is clearly ridiculous that taxpayers are landed with a bill of between £ 6bn and £ 7bn a year for in - work benefits because scrooge bosses are lining their own pockets			0
' shareholders have fought back against excessive pay this year in an extraordinary show of strength , with the so - called ‘ shareholder spring ’ claiming senior scalps including @entity183 , chief executive of insurance giant @entity185 , and @entity186 ’s @entity137			1
yet surviving senior managers are only seeing increase in their pay packets			0
the top earner was @entity60 , chief executive of @entity61 , which has just issued a profit warning but paid @entity60 £ 15.9m			1
@entity63 ’s sir @entity62 , who suffered one of the biggest shareholder revolts on pay in recent history , was second with £ 14.2m			1
@entity196 , chairman of the @entity197 , said : ‘ at a time of biting austerity for the economy , those at the top of our biggest companies are seeing their pay continue to increase sharply compared to everyone else			2
‘ the gap between rewards in the boardroom and those for the rest of society has opened up to unsustainable levels			0
shareholders have tried to rein in some of the worst excesses this year , but this has only been partially successful			0

top earner was @entity60 , chief executive of @entity61 , with £ 15.9m
while pay has stayed roughly the same , incentives have *soared*
