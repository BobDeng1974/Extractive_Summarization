heavy drinking males : scientists at @entity3 have identified six different types of obese person ( file image ) there are six different types of obese person , scientists have today revealed			1
the distinction , they hope , will allow for tailor - made treatments to help different obese people combat their weight			1
researchers at the @entity3 analysed people with a body mass index of 30 or more - a recognised measure of obesity			2
they found obese people fall into one of six categories : the scientists said their findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should not target obese people as a whole , rather treat them according to the ' type ' of obese person they are			1
dr @entity28 , who led the study , said : ' policies designed to tackle obesity and encourage healthier lifestyles often target individuals just because they are obese			2
' but a focus on just the group as a whole is not very efficient			0
we are all different and different health promotion approaches work for different people			0
' our research showed that those in the groups that we identified are likely to need very different services , and will respond very differently to different health promotion policies			0
' @entity53 has long been used to measure individuals in terms of their height and weight , but does not account for variation across other factors such as health , demographic and behavioural characteristics			0
the team at @entity64 looked at health - related variables , including whether individuals reported conditions like fatigue , pain , insomnia , depression , diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease or cancer			2
young healthy females : the scientists said their findings suggest that clinicians and policy makers should not target obese people as a whole , rather treat them according to the ' type ' of obese person they are			1
the largest cluster was ' younger healthy females ' - also the youngest group ( file image ) 3			2
the affluent and healthy elderly : this group was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption ( file image ) demographic variables accounted for were age , sex , ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation , while well - being was assessed by asking people how satisfied they were with their lives on a scale of nought to 10			1
whether participants smoked and the number of units of alcohol they consumed in the previous week was also taken into consideration			0
the physically sick but happy elderly : they had a higher prevalence of chronic health problems including high blood pressure ( file image ) as was whether or not they engaged in active weight management - going to slimming clubs , for example - and whether they made a conscious effort to eat more healthily			1
researchers discovered the largest cluster was ' younger healthy females ' - also the youngest group			2
they were the group most likely to display positive health characteristics , and engaged in some healthy behaviours			0
' heavy drinking males ' showed similar characteristics , but consumed a high level of alcohol			1
they were less likely to be managing their weight , though did report above average levels of physical exercise and walking			0
the ' unhappy anxious middle - aged ' group was primarily female , had poor mental health and reported high levels of insomnia , anxiety , depression and fatigue			1
their sense of well - being was relatively low , but they did engage in healthy physical activity and weight management , and had the lowest alcohol consumption			0
the final three clusters captured different patterns among older people			0
the ' affluent healthy elderly ' was the least deprived cluster and had positive health characteristics - although the group included a large proportion with high blood pressure - and above average alcohol consumption			1
the ' physically sick but happy elderly ' group had a higher prevalence of chronic health conditions - including osteoarthritis , diabetes and high blood pressure - but exhibited low levels of anxiety and depression			1
the unhappy and anxious middle - aged : this group was primarily female , had poor mental health and reported high levels of insomnia , anxiety , depression and fatigue ( file image ) 6			1
those with the poorest health : this group was found to be the most deprived , and had the highest prevalence of chronic health conditions			2
and they tended not to engage in healthy behaviours ( file image ) the final group , made up of those with the ' poorest health ' , was the most deprived , had the highest prevalence of most chronic health conditions , and tended not to engage in healthy behaviours			2
it also had the highest average @entity53			0
researchers said health professionals should assess what group obese patients might fall into and treat them accordingly			0
for example , for the ' unhappy anxious middle - aged ' an intervention involving increasing exercise may need to be mixed with psycho - social counselling , while for those in the ' poorest health ' , group advice on exercise may not be reasonable and more modest goals may be needed			1
meanwhile messages about alcohol reduction could help tackle obesity in young adults			0
the findings are published in the @entity209 .			0

@entity3 study found six different type of obese person
heavy drinking males , young healthy females , affluent elderly , physically sick elderly , unhappy middle - aged and those with the poorest health
hope their findings will help *doctors* create tailor - made treatments
heavy drinking males
young healthy females
the affluent and healthy elderly
the physically sick but happy elderly
the unhappy and anxious middle - aged
those with the poorest health
