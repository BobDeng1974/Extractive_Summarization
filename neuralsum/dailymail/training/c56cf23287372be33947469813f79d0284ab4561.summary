@entity7 , who has autism , attended the @entity9 , in @entity10 , @entity11 , for seven years , during which time she said she would be tied up and shocked as part of her treatment			1
the centre has said it uses the @entity15 ( ged ) shock treatment as an ' aversion therapy ' , in a bid to stop students from displaying aggressive or self - harming behaviour			1
@entity7 , who has autism , attended the @entity9 , in @entity10 , @entity11 , for seven years , during which time she said she received numerous shocks students selected to receive the shocks wear backpacks with a device inside which can be activated by members of staff carrying a remote control as part of her treatment , staff members would create a list of behaviors which would result in a shock , such as banging her head or making certain hand movements			1
ms @entity7 however , who left the centre in 2009 , has said she felt like she received the painful shocks as punishment for being disabled			1
she told @entity42 correspondent @entity41 : ' it 's not humane , you do n't even feel like a person , you have wires all over your body			0
i would get five or ten shocks for just doing one thing			0
' students selected to receive the shocks wear backpacks with a device inside which can be activated by members of staff carrying a remote control			0
the school faced a storm of controversy two years ago when a shocking video showing a disabled teenage boy being tied up and given 31 electric shocks over seven hours was shown to a court			1

the school faced a storm of controversy two years ago when a shocking video showing a disabled teenage boy being tied up and given 31 electric shocks over seven hours was shown to a court mr @entity64 , who has learning difficulties , sued the centre in april 2012 for the treatment he had received ten years earlier			1
according to @entity77 , the case was settled before a verdict was given by the jury			0
during the hearing his mother @entity80 told the court : ' i never signed up for him to be tortured , terrorised , and abused			0
i had no idea — no idea — that they tortured the children in the school			0
' i could n't turn @entity64 's head to the left or to the right			0
he was just staring straight			0
i took my hands and went like this ( waves hand in front of her face ) , he did n't blink			0
' the video shows student @entity64 strapped face down and shocked because he would not remove his coat the centre has now said it no longer uses a restraint board when administering shocks			2
@entity64 sued the centre in april 2012 for treatment he had received ten years earlier			2
the case was settled before the jury delivered a verdict earlier this year , ms @entity7 gave testimony to a @entity109 , which had met to discuss the ' safety and effectiveness ' of using shocks as a form of treatment			1
four years ago the @entity115 said the technique used at the school amounted to ' torture ' , and urged @entity120 's government to put a stop to it			1
in a statement to @entity42 , @entity9 said @entity7 ' did very well on the @entity15 ; she was receiving treatment for self - abusive behavior such as severe head banging			1
' the center goes on to say all other treatment had not worked and she also sent positive emails to the school after leaving five years ago			1
established in 1971 to help ' fix ' children who are disruptive and intent on self - harm , the school is known for their use of such tactics which they believe induces positive changes in behaviour			2
at the time of the @entity64 case two years ago , @entity140 reported how according to literature provided by the school , children do not feel the electric shocks are anything for students or parents to be concerned about			1
' this treatment , which feels like a hard pinch , has been extensively validated in the scientific literature ... is extremely effective , and has no significant adverse side effects , ' the paperwork said			0
aversion therapy is a controversial form of therapy which is based on the premise that certain types of behaviour can be avoided if those displaying it associate it with an unpleasant feeling			2
this form of encouraging ' learnt behaviour ' , as made famous in the @entity167 novel @entity166 , has received much criticism over the years			2
questions have been raised over how effective the treatment is over the long - term while others have raised serious ethical concerns			2
according to @entity175 , it is unclear why the shocks have certain effects , while the treatment is also believed to be less effective in the outside world away from the therapist			0
it is also said to have a high relapse rate .			0
