she added that would - be teachers are meeting more experienced teachers who tell them ' this is no career to enter '			0
miss @entity0 described teaching as being ‘ incompatible with a normal life ’ because it is ‘ monitored to within an inch of its life ’ due to the demands of heads keen to impress @entity48 inspectors			0
dr @entity0 told delegates that former education secretary @entity50 said before he entered office that teachers should be highly valued and he wanted to give the profession more freedom over how to teach			2
' if that was @entity50 's intention , and i am sure that was his honest intention , how is it at the end of the coalition 's term in office that not only are record numbers of teachers leaving the profession mid-career , but there is also a crisis of teacher supply ? ' she said			0

' trainee and newly - qualified teachers can not fail to understand that , despite @entity50 's intentions , teaching has become a profession monitored to within an inch of its life			1
' dr @entity0 added : ' seeing what teaching has become , and what the prospect of a career in teaching holds for them , is it in any way surprising that trainee and newly - qualified teachers make the decision to make use of their talents and abilities in a different profession ? ' it is sad - but true - that students and @entity128 are being told by the teachers they meet during training that with current workload , inspection and pay , this is no career to enter			1
