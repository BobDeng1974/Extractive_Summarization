he is ‘ excited and charged ’ by his new multi-million dollar job with the @entity2			1
but @entity4 feels betrayed by people inside @entity6 whom he considered ‘ friends ’ after a string of ‘ mean - spirited digs ’ following his exit from @entity11 , @entity3 can reveal today			1
a source close to the star said : ‘ @entity4 was with @entity6 for 25 years , when he did the goodbye show at @entity11 he felt good about walking out the door			1
‘ but then came these digs by people that throughout his career he would have called friends and he does n’t understand why – or what ’s in it for anybody			0
however , since his departure , @entity4 , 52 , has been subjected to reports he is power crazed – and that he left @entity6 purely as a money - making venture			1
and a source close to @entity4 revealed the attacks are upsetting during a particularly ‘ joyous ’ time in his career – adding he is particularly upset that his husband @entity51 has been dragged into it			2
@entity4 ’s new job makes him the on - air face of the @entity2 , based in @entity55 , appearing as host and serving as managing editor			1
‘ he had his first day at the @entity2 yesterday and he ’s excited and charged and had the best day ever and these ridiculous stories do n’t make any sense at all , ' said the source			1
while @entity41 , 53 , has recently signed a massive new deal with @entity6 , tv chiefs are currently negotiating new contracts with @entity11 stars @entity42 , @entity65 and @entity66 – all of whom have deals up within the year , leaving the network in somewhat of a perilous situation at the top - rated morning show in the @entity73 @entity4 has kept in touch with ‘ one or two ’ of his @entity11 pals since leaving , but the friend said : ‘ there ’s a lot going on with them and they are in negotiations , he wants to step away while there is this negative gossip			1
‘ his tactic is that he needs to focus on his new job			0
and he wants them to make the best decisions for their lives and careers			0
‘ @entity4 has been with the @entity6 since 1988 as weather host for @entity4 , according to his friend , what is upsetting are reports that @entity6 were lining up his replacement @entity96 months ago as they believed he was unhappy at the network			2
however , the source said : ‘ here ’s the thing , @entity4 ’s contract with @entity6 was up at the very end of november			2
he went to @entity6 in late summer and said ‘ let ’s start talking ’ as he wanted to know he had a future at the network ‘ they did n’t start talking until the first few weeks of november , which is when the @entity2 deal came up			2
‘ it was n’t a long - range plan , it was n’t anything that had been going on for a year , that ’s just not true			0
‘ he never saw the opportunity coming , but this is what he loves , he tried for years to convince the network that weather is news and it ’s important			0
‘ @entity2 already knows this and they want to more			2
@entity4 thought @entity6 understood this			0
‘ he told them he would try to make everyone happy and make everyone look good			0
’ the source added : ‘ it was joyous for @entity4 , he did n’t see why anyone should feel bad – he went and told everyone he loved them and walked out the door and the next morning comes this mean - spirited attack , like being punched			2
’ attacking claims that he merely wanted to leave in an exercise to be able to licence his image on products like coffee mugs , the source insisted : ‘ @entity4 ’s deal with @entity6 was n’t exclusive			0
‘ if he had wanted to licence merchandise he would have - all he needed was @entity6 ’s approval			0
‘ he did n’t bolt to make all kinds of crazy money			0
’ sad goodbyes : champion ( far right ) bid farewell to the rest of the @entity11 team on december 4 ( @entity149 ) @entity32 , @entity41 , @entity66 and @entity65 upset : @entity4 is said to be most upset his husband @entity51 had been used in digs against him since leaving @entity6			1
the couple are seen on their honeymoon and discussing rumours that @entity4 ’s husband @entity157 , 36 , had persuaded him to leave @entity11 as he refused to leave his hometown of @entity159 – so they could start a family , the source said : ‘ it ’s not fair to bring @entity157 into it			1
‘ he would never have demanded that @entity4 leave @entity6 , if they were going to have babies @entity4 would be on the same schedule			0
‘ @entity157 had never even been to @entity55 before yesterday			0
' ironically , in his new role , @entity4 now joins forces with his former rival , today weather co-host @entity167 , whose one - hour @entity168 airs on @entity2 weekdays at 6am ( est ) , then repeats at 10am			1
@entity145 's new morning show will be tucked in between , airing from 7 to 10am			0
and @entity4 will also be in the partial employ ( in a sense ) of his old network rival : the @entity2 is owned by a consortium made up in part of @entity175			1
but interestingly , the first person to send @entity4 a text of support when he announced his departure from @entity11 was mr @entity167			1
champion was in fits of laughter as tapes from the @entity6 archives were brought back to haunt him on his last day on @entity11 @entity4 and @entity32 became very emotional as they said goodbye on their last breakfast show together @entity96 , who was on the ground in @entity189 , @entity190 , on december 4 to cover the severe winter storm , has taken over from @entity145 as weather presenter at @entity11 @entity195 , 59 , who hosts @entity168 on the @entity2 and sent a text saying ‘ congratulations , you ’re going to love this place ! ’ the pair already plan lunch when @entity4 ’s back in @entity204 and the source said : ‘ they ’ve known each other for 25 years , @entity4 knows @entity195 ’s wife and family and they socialise together			1
‘ @entity4 is not going to today , he ’s doing a 2/3 hour breakfast show on the @entity2			2
‘ ‘ @entity4 does n’t understand why @entity6 ca n’t be happy for him – they have a great show , great talent and they do n’t need to dig at him			0
he just wishes them the best			0
’ ' news veteran : he 'll begin hosting @entity2 's new flagship morning show early next year , which airs right after his former rival @entity167 's morning programme			1
