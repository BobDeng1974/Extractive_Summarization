by @entity1 reporter published : 12:50 est , 30 november 2012 updated : 14:42 est , 30 november 2012 fighting : @entity2 pictured in hospital being treated for whooping cough a new mother told of the terrifying moment she took her two - week - old baby to doctors with a chest infection to be told the youngster had whooping cough			1
@entity12 , 26 , took her daughter @entity13 to @entity14 , in @entity15 , @entity16 three times , but the condition went undetected			1
the youngster 's clear chest meant medics never even considered she might be suffering from whooping cough			1
it was n't until mrs @entity2 stayed in the surgery chatting to the doctor after her third examination that the medic picked up on the youngster 's distinctive cough			1
the doctor told mrs @entity2 and her husband , policeman @entity32 , 26 , to take their daughter straight to @entity35			1
hospital staff hurriedly ran tests after hearing the recognisable ' whooping ' sound and discovered to her parents dismay that one of her little lungs had collapsed			1
struggling and fighting for her life the little youngster was unable to feed causing shocking water retention - making her tiny body double in size			1
today mrs @entity2 warned all parents to be on guard against the killer virus as the outbreak of a new whooping cough epidemic was confirmed			2
she said : ' we brought her home from the hospital after she was born and the whole family had colds and coughs			2
' so when @entity13 started to develop a little cough and became a little groggy we did n't think anything of it we just thought she had caught our cold			1
' i took to her the doctors for the first time when she had just turned two - weeks - old because she still sounded chested			0
' when doctors checked her chest they said it was all clear , i went back a week later because nothing had improved but once again the doctor said her chest was completely clear			1
' while we were chatting in the doctors surgery @entity13 started to cough and the doctor just looked so alarmed - she said " i think it 's whooping cough " and i just burst into tears			1
doctors realised one of @entity13 's tiny lungs had collapsed after she was rushed to @entity35 ' in the hospital me and my husband were sat beside her and she started to make the unusual coughing noise - which we were use to by now			1
' and suddenly we were surrounded by doctors and nurses who were frantic that she was n't going to be able to breathe			0
' it was terrifying because she was just under four - weeks - old and i wanted to cuddle her and tell her she 's going to be ok			2
' it was unsettling because whooping cough has only recently started reoccurring again			2
' one member of staff said it was only the second case they had ever seen.we worried because @entity13 is so precious and tiny and she was brand new			1
' the injection for whooping cough was released the day @entity13 was submitted into hospital , if i was pregnant now i would n't even question having the jab			1
' if you see your daughter struggling to breathe , covered in tubes , fighting for a life she 's barely lived yet there is no doubt that you would want to stop that from happening			2
' you never think it will be your child			0
' on the mend : @entity13 is now recovering according to medics cases of whooping cough ( pertussis ) have soared since 2011 @entity13 , who was born on september 5 , developed cold - like symptoms shortly after mrs @entity2 gave birth			1
unaware of the deadly symptoms , mrs @entity2 from @entity15 , @entity16 , continued to monitor the " cold " taking her back and forth to the doctors			0
@entity13 caught what is known as the " 100 day cough " which lays undetected in the chest but can be picked up on early cold - like symptoms			1
the baby , now three - months - old , is still suffering from the illness but doctors hope she will make a full recovery			2
mrs @entity2 , a care assistant who is currently on maternity leave , added : ' me and @entity32 looked back over the video of @entity13 coughing last night and you forget just how poorly she was			1
' at one point her whole body was retaining so much water that it had collected to a point on her head			1
' i panicked , i was unconsolable , i thought the worst - that she was going to be brain damaged			0
' as the doctors moved her the water which had collected spread back through the body			1
' now she is slowly getting better , she is still coughing but she is out of the worst of it			0
we can only pray that she does n't pick up any infections because her immune system is so weak			0
' we just hope she 'll get better and not have any long term effects			0
' whooping cough is a highly contagious bacterial infection of the lungs and airways			2
the medical term for whooping cough is pertussis			2
the condition usually begins with a persistent dry and irritating cough which progresses to intense bouts of coughing			2
these are followed by a distinctive ' whooping ' noise			0
the coughing can last for around three months			0
other symptoms include raised temperature and vomiting after coughing			0
whooping cough is a cyclical disease with the number of cases peaking every 3 - 4 years			0
there is currently a peak occurring			0

it can be treated successfully with antibiotics and most people make a full recovery , however measures should be taken to stop it spreading			0
children with whooping cough should be kept away from school or nursery until they have taken antibiotics for five days			0
the same applies to adults returning to their workplace			0
young babies under the age of six months are likely to be admitted to hospital as they are most at risk of severe complications , such as serious breathing difficulties			0
they will be treated in isolation to prevent the infection spreading and will be given antibiotics into a vein through a drip ( intravenously )			0

@entity13 's condition was missed three times because her chest appeared clear
after a doctor detected the ' whooping ' sound she was rushed to hospital , where she was *diagnosed* with a collapsed lung
she suffered from water retention , which made her body double in size
@entity13 is finally on the road to recovery
