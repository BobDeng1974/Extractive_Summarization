by @entity0 and @entity1 thousands of previously unpublished @entity2 files that detail suspected sexual abuse by employees and volunteers , including doctors , teachers and priests , have been posted online			1
the @entity10 published the horrifying database with redacted victims ' names on tuesday , including material that was released earlier by an @entity17 judge 's ruling			1
the @entity2 kept the files - numbering almost 2,000 - for internal use for nearly a century , and they now reveal the systematic coverups by the organisation , which in turn led to more abuse			1
cover ups : @entity26 attorney @entity25 examines some of the previously confidential documents created by the @entity2 concerning child sex abuse within the organization the group has only conducted criminal background checks on volunteers since 2008 and finally , in 2010 , the organization mandated any suspected abuse be reported to police			1
in an analysis of the records , which span from 1985 to 1991 , the @entity10 found that reports of abuse increased over time , which may be the result of greater awareness of child sexual abuse			1
the reports are not believed to account for all abuse , because the @entity2 say an unknown number of files were destroyed over the years and not all victims report the crimes committed against them			1
the organization 's inaction , and its efforts to keep allegations from police , parents and the public , allowed molesters to continue sexually abusing children , according to @entity58			1
horrors : both @entity60 , left , and @entity61 , right , had criminal records before working with the scouts going public : @entity65 , who was abused between the ages of 8 and 18 while in the @entity2 , poses with his old uniform outside the @entity68 in @entity69 , @entity70 the released files reveal that a @entity73 chairman of four years , @entity72 , had a record of child molestation , had served prison time and was on probation for exposing himself			1
in another file , a scoutmaster said he had reported suspicions of abuse about scout leader @entity82 of @entity83 , but he was ignored by a superior			1
@entity82 was later accused of abusing a 15 - year - old in 1986 , convicted of sexual abuse and expelled from the @entity2			1
a review by the newspaper found that @entity89 officials often urged offenders who admitted to carrying out the abuse to quietly resign while helping others to cover their tracks			1
in about 80 per cent of cases that the @entity2 learned about , there is no record of officials reporting the allegations to police , and in more than 100 of the cases , officials actively sought to hide the abuse , the @entity10 found			1
sick example : in one of the files , assistant troop leader @entity104 is kicked out of the @entity2 after making a boy perform a sex act on him			2
there is no suggestion leaders called police and the examples of what they got away with are horrifying			0
one case details @entity116 , a @entity89 leader with 50 years of experience and numerous scouting awards - yet also a serial child molester			2
abuser : assistant troop leader @entity104 , whose file is pictured above when he was arrested in 1984 , local @entity89 official @entity123 claimed no one had known about @entity126 ' crimes , yet just six years earlier , @entity123 had told officials to interview a boy who claimed @entity116 had repeatedly performed oral sex on him			0
' he then told me to do the same and i did , ' the 12 - year - old boy said in a 1978 statement			2
officials did not report @entity116 ' alleged crime to police and even gave him a glowing reference two years later when he applied for a post at a national @entity89 event , the @entity10 found			1
@entity116 continued to work with the @entity2 and abused at least five more boys before police stopped him in 1984 after acting on a tip. he was found guilty of abusing 20 scouts , some as young as eight , and was sentenced to 151 years behind bars			0
in an earlier case , five @entity2 detailed two rapes and other sex abuses by a scoutmaster in @entity148 and he promptly resigned , saying he had to travel for work			0
in response , a troop representative wrote : ' good luck to you in your new position ' , adding that he was accepting the resignation ' with extreme regret '			0
in october , the @entity2 unsealed 1,247 confidential files and the organisation offered an apology and counseling to victims			2
' we have heard from victims of abuse and are doing our very best to respond to each person with our utmost care and sensitivity , ' @entity89 spokesman @entity163 said at the time			2
vindicated : @entity170 , left , leans into his lawyer , @entity171 , in a @entity26 , @entity173 , courtroom after a jury found the @entity2 negligent for sexual abuse by an assistant scoutmaster in the 1980s excuse : officials previously justified their actions as necessary to protect the good name of the @entity2 but in the years leading up to the files ' release , victims said they were the ones who were blamed			1
at a trial in 2010 , an @entity173 man alleged that the @entity89 organisation allowed troop leader @entity188 to continue working after he admitted molesting 17 boys in the early 1980s			1
in a shocking move at the hearing , regional @entity2 official @entity191 blamed parents for letting their sons go to the man 's apartment for merit badge work and sleepovers			1
' his parents should have known better , ' @entity191 said of one victim			0
' i think it 's criminal			2
' but the jury rejected that assertion , finding the @entity2 liable for nearly $ 20 million in damages			0
most of the files opened after 1991 have n't been released			1
various pending lawsuits were seeking those files			2
@entity211 stories of abuse from former boy scouts @entity65 and @entity214 by be middle - aged men now , but the abuse they suffered for a decade as @entity2 still haunts them to this day			1
' i still have some nightmares to this day of abuse , ' said @entity65 , pictured , who says the abuse went on from ages 8 - 18			1
the brothers say the @entity2 turned their backs on them when they needed support the most , as they were arrested at their home , during camping trips and elsewhere			0
they settled out - of - court after suing the @entity2 in 2003			2
in another shocking case , a scoutmaster admitted to raping a 17 - year - old boy on a camping trip and otherwise sexually molesting two other boys ; the victims corroborated his confession			1
but no charges were ever filed			0
the man was let off with a warning that should he be found with young men in the future , he was subject to immediate incarceration at the state prison			0
the man ' was asked to leave the parish , and if he was caught around or near any boy or youth organization , he would be sent to state prison immediately , ' a @entity89 executive wrote to national headquarters			0
' we are indeed sorry that scouting was involved			0
' in @entity252 , @entity148 , in august 1962 , a married 25 - year - old steel mill worker with a high school education pleaded guilty to ' serious morals ' violations involving @entity2			2
the scouting executive who served as both mayor and police chief made sure of one thing : the @entity89 name was never brought up			0
it went beyond the mayor to a three - judge panel , who also deemed it important to keep the @entity2 ' names out of the press			2
' no mention of @entity89 was involved in the case in as much as two of the three judges who pronounced sentence are members of our @entity273 , ' the @entity2 executive wrote to the national personnel division			0
in august 1966 , a boy at an unknown @entity89 camp reported he was molested by a rifle instructor			0
the camp director did n't believe the boy so he sent the @entity89 back out onto the rifle range and hid nearby to see what would happen			0
he saw the instructor molest the boy twice , according to the camp director 's memo			0
afterwards , the camp director held a meeting with the local scoutmaster			0
they were joined by the boys ' parents			0
the meeting closed with all parties agreeing that the instructor would be ' quietly dismissed , ' and to ' keep our knowledge private			0

the @entity10 published the shocking database on tuesday
newly - released files span from 1985 to 1991
@entity303 's inaction and coverups allowed molesters to continue abuse
