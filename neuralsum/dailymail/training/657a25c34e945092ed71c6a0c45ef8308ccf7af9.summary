by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 09:56 est , 24 september 2013 updated : 02:19 est , 25 september 2013 a @entity3 official said tuesday that while it would welcome ' an encounter ' between president @entity8 and @entity5 president @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity5 officials have turned them down			1
@entity8 told the @entity12 on tuesday that the @entity1 is primarily focusing its diplomatic efforts on @entity5 's nuclear program and the @entity17 - @entity16 conflict			1
the @entity1 , he said , will support @entity5 's use of nuclear energy , and will attempt to negotiate directly with @entity9			1
' @entity1 see an @entity5 government that has declared the @entity1 an enemy , ' he said , ' and directly – or through proxies – taken @entity1 hostage , killed @entity1 troops and civilians , and threatened our ally @entity17 with destruction			2
' ' i do n’t believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight – the suspicion runs too deep			0
but i do believe that if we can resolve the issue of @entity5 ’s nuclear program , that can serve as a major step down a long road towards a different relationship – one based on mutual interests and mutual respect			0
that phrase – mutual respect – is one that @entity5 has used lately to demonstrate its eagerness for acceptance in the @entity46			0
he cautioned that rebels might block inspectors from reaching some of the locations where chemical weapons are stored ' the @entity5 have an internal dynamic that they have to manage and the relationship with the @entity1 is clearly quite different than the relationship that @entity5 has with other @entity73 nations , " a senior administration official told @entity68			2
@entity8 said he had instructed secretary of state @entity74 to talk directly with @entity5			1
he also demanded a @entity76 resolution on tuesday that would hold @entity77 president @entity55 responsible for an august 21 chemical weapons attack that killed more than 1,400 , saying ' the evidence is overwhelming ' that the @entity77 dictator was behind the action			1
' it 's an insult to human reason ... to suggest that anyone other than the regime carried out this attack , ' @entity8 said			0
and in a defense of the @entity1 , @entity8 claimed @entity1 exceptionalism is alive and well			2
' some may disagree , but i believe @entity1 is exceptional , ' he told the @entity12 , standing up ' for the interests of all			0
' in a @entity95 op - ed earlier this month , @entity93 president @entity92 wrote that it is ' extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional , whatever the motivation			1
' @entity1 secretary of state @entity74 ( r ) and @entity49 ambassador @entity100 ( @entity101 ) listened to @entity8 with rapt attention tuesday @entity8 ( on screen ) addressed the 68th @entity12 at the @entity49 in @entity10 noting that @entity55 has ' given an accounting ' of its chemical weapons stockpiles and promised to have them dismantled , @entity8 told diplomats that ' there must be a strong @entity76 resolution to verify that the @entity55 regime is keeping its commitments			1
' ' there must be consequences if they fail to do so , ' the president added			0
' if we can not agree even on this , then it will show that the @entity12 is incapable of enforcing the most basic of international laws			0
' @entity8 said tuesday that he had written a letter to @entity5 's supreme leader @entity123 , emphasizing that he wants a diplomatic solution to @entity5 's growing nuclear program ' our response has not matched the scale of the challenge ' in @entity77 , @entity8 said , where ' peaceful protests against an authoritarian regime were met with oppression and slaughter			1
' while @entity8 demanded a @entity76 resolution that provides a penalty if @entity77 renegs on its commitment , he reiterated that his preference ' has always been a diplomatic resolution to this issue ' and , he said , he has no desire to determine who leads @entity77 , whether it 's @entity55 or a replacement			1
' that 's for the @entity77 people to decide , ' he said , noting that @entity1 - led regime change in other parts of the world have been fraught with unintended consequences			2
' the @entity1 has a hard - earned humility when it comes to our ability to determine events inside other people 's countries , ' @entity8 conceded			2
but , he insisted , the @entity1 must remain engaged in @entity77 for its own national security reasons			2
the @entity3 said after @entity8 's speech that the @entity1 will provide $ 339 million in new @entity77 humanitarian aid , bringing the @entity1 funding total to nearly $ 1.4 billion			1
that humanitarian assistance , the administration said , includes food , clean water , shelter , medical care , and relief supplies to over 4.2 million people inside @entity77 and more than two million refugees			0
at a luncheon event tuesday , @entity8 thanked the @entity49 for providing the weapons inspectors who determined the scale of the aug. 21 chemical weapons attack in a @entity175 suburb and collected evidence of who was to blame			0
' the dedicated @entity49 inspectors in @entity175 , ' he said , ' set out into battlefield conditions			0
they worked diligently with great professionalism			0
they uncovered the truth , and they have the thanks of the world			0
' @entity8 sat high on the dais and far apart from the diplomats in @entity10 , before his 40 - minute address rep. @entity191 said the @entity1 should ' double down ' on sanctions against @entity5 in order to avoid repeating the mistakes made with @entity195 @entity5 president @entity9 continues to pursue his country 's nuclear program , while @entity8 cautions against the development of atomic weapons @entity200 , the former @entity1 ambassador to the @entity12 , was critical of both the @entity76 and the @entity12 , writing on tuesday that its usefulness is limited			1
' there is no such thing as the @entity12 , ' @entity200 wrote in the @entity205			0
' it is simply a collection of nations pursuing their respective interests , from time to time led by the @entity1			0
' rep. @entity191 , the @entity211 @entity210 who chairs the @entity212 , told @entity213 that in dealing with @entity5 , the @entity1 should look at ' the mistake we made in 2005 or 2006 ' in lifting sanctions against @entity195 , allowing then - president @entity217 to drag out negotiations while he built a nuclear weapons program			1
' instead , ' he said , ' we should double down ' on @entity5 sanctions and force president @entity9 's hand			2
speaking of @entity5 , the president said that he had written both @entity9 and @entity5 supreme leader @entity123 to say ' that @entity1 prefers to resolve our concerns over @entity5 ’s nuclear program peacefully , but that we are determined to prevent them from developing a nuclear weapon			1
' ' we are not seeking regime change , and we respect the right of the @entity5 people to access peaceful nuclear energy , ' he insisted .			1

@entity8 has told secretary of state @entity74 to talk directly with @entity5 's diplomats for the first time
a new *attitude* toward @entity5 emerged , with @entity8 saying the @entity1 respects @entity5 's right to ' peaceful ' nuclear power
the @entity76 , the president told the diplomats , must back its demands of @entity77 's @entity55 with the *credible* threat of force
' i believe @entity1 is exceptional , ' he insisted , in direct *rebuttal* to @entity93 's @entity92
