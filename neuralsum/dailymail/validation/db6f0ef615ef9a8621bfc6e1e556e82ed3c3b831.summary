billions of stars in our galaxy have between one and three planets which could potentially support life			2
astronomers came to the conclusion after calculating the chances of planets orbiting in the ' @entity9 '			2
this is the belt around a star where temperatures are ideal for liquid water to pool on a planet 's surface , and for alien life to exist			0
the illustration shows the habitable zone for different types of stars			1
the green area is the habitable zone ( @entity24 ) , where liquid water can exist on a planet ’s surface			1
the red area is too hot for liquid water on the planetary surface and the blue area is too cold for liquid water on the planetary surface ' according to the statistics and the indications we have , a good share of the planets in the habitable zone will be solid planets where there might be liquid water and where life could exist , ' said @entity41 , from the @entity42			1
the findings are based on data from the @entity46 space agency @entity48 's kepler space telescope , which has confirmed the existence of around 1,000 planets orbiting stars in the @entity52			1
it has also identified an estimated 3,000 other candidate worlds			2
many of the stars have solar systems of two to six planets , but scientists believe there could be more that remain undiscovered by @entity62 , which is best suited to finding large planets in relatively close orbits			2
to estimate the positions of the ' hidden ' planets , the researchers updated a 250 - year - old mathematical concept called the @entity69 law			1
pictured are exoplanetary systems where the previously known planets are marked with blue dots , while the red dots show the planets predicted by the @entity69 on the composition of planetary systems			1
124 planetary systems in the survey – based on data from the @entity62 satellite , fit with this formula the law , which inferred the existence of @entity84 before it was seen , states that there is a certain ratio between the orbital periods of planets in a solar system			1
the @entity69 law was formulated around 1770 and correctly calculated the position of @entity84 before it was even discovered			0
the law states that there is a certain ratio between the orbital periods of planets in a solar system			2
so the ratio between the orbital period of the first and second planet is the same as the ratio between the second and the third planet and so on			0
this means if you know how long it takes for some of the planets to orbit around a star , you can calculate how long it takes for the other planets to orbit and can calculate their position in the planetary system			2
you can also calculate if a planet is ' missing ' in the sequence			0
because of this , if you know how long it takes some planets to circle a star , you can work out the time taken for other planets to orbit and fix their positions in the planetary system			2
you can also calculate if a planet is missing in the sequence			0
' we decided to use this method to calculate the potential planetary positions in 151 planetary systems , where the @entity62 satellite had found between three and six planets , ' said mr @entity41			1
' in 124 of the planetary systems , the @entity69 fit with the position of the planets			1
' using @entity141 's law we tried to predict where there could be more planets further out in the planetary systems			1
' but we only made calculations for planets where there is a good chance that you can see them with the @entity62 satellite			0
' in this way , the scientists predicted a total of 228 planets in the 151 systems and concluded that each system should have an average of one to three planets in the habitable zone			1
extrapolating further , this suggested that there could be billions of stars in the @entity52 with habitable zone planets where surface water and life could exist			1
the scientists , whose findings appear in the journal @entity169 , have made a shortlist of 77 ' hidden ' planets			0
they say these planets have a good chance of being spotted as they pass in front of their parent stars light curves of the some of the planets orbiting the star @entity181			0
the dip in the light curve occurs when the planet moves in front of the host star , thereby dimming the light of the star			0
the dip in the light curve is proportional to the size of the planet			0
the @entity62 satellite observes exoplanets by measuring the light curve of a star			0
when a planet moves in front of the star there is a small dip in brightness			0
if this little dip in brightness occurs regularly , there might be a planet orbiting the star and obscuring its light			0

astronomers used an *improved* *version* of a 250 - year old equation
it helped predict a total of 228 planets in the 151 planetary systems
they believe there are one to three planets in the habitable zone of each
extending equation to the entire @entity52 means there are more habitable worlds in existence than previously believed
