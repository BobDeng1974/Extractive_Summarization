@entity7 says : ' there was a short - haired contestant in 2009 with blonde hair but hers was shoulder length and that was considered short			1
mine is cropped so is much shorter			0
' @entity7 says that for her winning was especially important after the short - haired miss @entity42 lost out to the long haired miss @entity44 at last year 's @entity47 final			1
@entity7 took home the crown at the miss @entity13 finals which was her first ever beauty pageant @entity7 wants to demonstrate to other potential contestants that you do n't have to conform to win ' everyone was so shocked that short hair would get in the way of winning			1
so i am pleased that more short - haired women are being recognised in beauty pageants now			1
' i want to prove that long hair is n't the only beautiful hairstyle			2
' @entity7 , who works as a coordinator receptionist has a history of charity work which she says helped her find her way into beauty pageants			2
' i 'm really into charity work and i wanted to expand that so pageanting was the perfect fit			0
it was @entity7 's love of charity work that helped her find her way into pageanting , she now works with @entity73 , a @entity75 charity ' it was researching pageanting online that i found @entity73 ( the @entity75 charity ) and that 's what got me into the pageanting scene			2

there are no rules , anyone can enter			0
i did and i won			0
' i believe all women are beautiful in their own way and that they should not feel the need to look the same just to fit in			0
' @entity7 added that many young women are unaware that there are no requirements to enter a pageant and she believes that is down to bad stereotypes			2
' a lot people think that beauty pageants are old - fashioned because they have this perception of a traditional looking girl , but it 's not the pageants that are old - fashioned , it 's the public 's perception			0
' @entity7 's hair helped to set her apart from her more traditional looking competitors but rather than rely on a salon for her perfect crop , @entity7 looks to her own mother , @entity129			2
' my mum is the only person allowed to cut my hair i never go to salons			0
i have had my cropped hair for about six years , and will probably always have it			0
