the sombre rumours have stalked him down the decades , but now they are acquiring greater urgency			0
@entity4 is gravely ill. @entity5 , the brutal legacy of his 21 years in the professional ring , has tightened its hold and , at 72 , there are signs that his battle may soon be over			1
in time , many will attempt to assess the career of the most dramatically gifted and socially significant sportsman who ever lived			2
but in the week ahead , we shall concentrate on the 40th anniversary of his most extraordinary achievement			0
‘ @entity21 ’ sounds like one of those promotional slogans which emerge from a three - bottle lunch			1
yet somehow it captured the swaggering audacity of the project which saw the two most celebrated athletes on the planet fight for the richest prize in sport in the small hours of a @entity29 morning			2
@entity4 looks on after knocking down @entity30 in the so - called @entity21 october 30 , 1974 : @entity4 versus @entity30			1
the heavyweight title was at stake , and the world was captivated			1
the fight was made possible by the president of @entity36 , @entity35 , a deeply corrupt human rights abuser , who systematically exploited the nation formerly known as the @entity40 for more than 30 years			1
@entity35 paid more than $ 10million to promote his own image			0
it was then an unimaginable sum , far more than fighters had ever commanded			0
but then , he was hiring the very best			0
@entity4 was 32 years old and was attempting to regain the title he had lost to @entity45 more than a year earlier			1
although many shared his own opinion that he was the greatest ‘ of ahhhhhl tahm ! ’ , they also suspected that he was past his peak , that after 46 fights his talents were eroding			2
@entity4 was brought to @entity36 for the fight by the infamous president of @entity36 @entity35 @entity4 trains in front of a captive audience in @entity29 before a cut to @entity30 's eye delayed the fight above and beyond all this lay a widespread conviction that the 25 - year - old @entity30 was genuinely invincible , a monster , one of the most terrifying punchers the sport had known			1
he had won the title with a murderous dismantling of @entity67 , and he saw @entity4 as his lucrative victim			1
‘ my opponents do n’t worry about losing , ’ he said			0
‘ they worry about getting hurt			0
’ it was as near as this malevolent , taciturn presence ever came to humour			0
by dazzling contrast , @entity4 was a force of nature ; bright , funny , endlessly personable and dauntingly handsome			1
somebody once wrote of a fabled heavyweight : ‘ @entity79 was a newspaperman ’s champion			2
he always finished in time for the first edition , so the guys could get to the bar before closing			2
’ @entity4 will forever be remembered as the greatest heavyweight boxer in history , but the sport took its toll @entity4 took a lot of punishment by methodically drawing @entity30 in to waste the younger fighter 's energy 60,000 roaring fans packed @entity29 ’s outdoor @entity96 du @entity94 for the fight			1
32 - year - old @entity4 was seven years older than his opponent and a fading former champ not expected to last more than three rounds			1
it is said that in the dressing room , @entity30 and his ringside crew had knelt to pray that he did not kill @entity4			1
450 locations in the @entity105 and @entity106 — and in some cinemas in the @entity108 — screened the fight on closed - circuit television			1
100 countries were estimated to have taken the fight , which was scheduled to start at 4.0am in @entity36 to accommodate audiences in the @entity105			1
10 million dollars was split between the two — $ 5m each — paid for by president @entity35			0
45 @entity30 first quit in 1977 and returned in the early @entity115 — winning the world title again at 45 , becoming the oldest heavyweight champion in history			1
but when @entity4 started to paint his word - pictures , he made the bar seem a poor alternative			1
before the @entity30 fight , he ran through his repertoire			1
he was contemptuous : ‘ @entity30 ’s a big old bully from @entity125 who used to beat up people on the streets			1
’ he was dismissive : ‘ @entity30 hits hard , sure			1
but hitting power do n’t mean nothing if you ca n’t find nothing to hit			0
’ he spouted yards of his terrible poetry : ‘ you think the world was shocked when @entity136 resigned ? / wait till i whup @entity30 ’s behind			1
’ and , right across the world , the public lapped it up			0
there was a false start when a sparring partner ’s elbow cut @entity30 ’s eye and both fighters were required to remain in @entity36 for a month while @entity30 recovered			1
@entity4 spent much of the time storming around town and leading the locals in chants of ‘ @entity4 , bomaye ! ’ ( @entity4 , kill him ! )			1
finally , on october 30 , 1974 , in the @entity152 , before 60,000 people , a bell sounded and a fight began			2
@entity4 had the locals in @entity36 chanting ' @entity155 ' , which translated means ' @entity4 , kill him ! ' @entity4 begins returning the heavyweight champion of the world 's blows with interest the legend has grown , these past 40 years , that @entity4 offered himself as a target , that he simply lay on the ropes and allowed @entity30 to punch himself out			1
the promotional poster for the @entity21 well , up to a point			2
watching the fight through once again this week , it could be seen that for calculated spells , @entity4 encouraged @entity30 to throw those scything punches , most of which were deflected by arms and gloves			1
but time and again he would cut loose from the ropes with bewildering combinations to the head			0
@entity30 grew increasingly confused , unbearably weary			2
and all the time , @entity4 talked to him : ‘ you was sp’osed to be bad , @entity30 ! show me something ! that all you got , sucker ? an ’ you gettin ’ tired , @entity30			1
@entity181 n’t no place to get tired ... ’ and then , in the dying seconds of round eight , @entity4 found the energy and strength to throw the conclusive combination , and @entity30 simply crumpled , exhausted , to the floor			1
i recall the @entity190 cinema erupting in joy and relief as the count finished and the aisles were awash with dancing , jostling figures			0
@entity4 had that effect ; neutrality was not an option			2
i remember walking out into the @entity201 dawn , and thinking i should never see anything quite like that again			0
he would have a third fight with @entity67 , a vicious battle in which both men inflicted enduring mental and physical damage			0
then , as his resistance began to dissolve , every contest became an ordeal			0
@entity30 puts up his guard as @entity4 surges forward in what has been described as ' @entity215 ' referee @entity216 counts out foreman after @entity4 puts him on the canvass in the 8th round on october 2 , 1980 , in a casino car park in @entity221 , i squirmed at ringside as @entity4 , old beyond his 38 years , was cruelly punished by @entity223			1
he took punch after pounding punch to his unprotected head , but his perverse pride would not allow him to fall			0
so he stood and accepted his punishment , and the odious leeches who had taken his money and bathed in his glory simply shrugged and moved on			0
the illness which would ultimately devour him took hold			0
the speech grew slower and thicker , the reactions ponderous , the decline precipitous			0
as his condition became more distressing , it provoked serious moral questions about our readiness to condone such licensed barbarity			0
after all , if the very best of them could suffer such an excruciating fate , how can boxing hope to protect those who have only their courage to commend them ? for many of us , the answer was all too obvious			0
@entity4 staged three fights with the legendary @entity67 , which left both men physically and mentally damaged @entity4 's brash style changed the way that sportsmen behaved , although few have backed their arrogance with genius @entity4 left a tangled legacy			2
effectively , he legitimised boasting and strident self - praise			0
before @entity4 , sporting modesty was mandatory ; you were diffident in victory , gracious in defeat			2
after @entity4 , across all our major sports , the old rules fell into disuse			2
we now see an ordinary footballer celebrate a goal , or a journeyman cricketer a wicket , and all too easily we summon up a vision of a brash young man from @entity280 , @entity281			0
but the fact that routinely escapes the capering imposters is that the young man happened to be a genius			0
for once , it is not too inflated a term to describe what he did and how he did it			0
in this anniversary week , as @entity4 ’s condition grows increasingly hazardous , i shall recall the words of @entity30 , when he made a visit to @entity190 two or three years ago			1
@entity30 had escaped the fate which befell @entity4			1
he was in robust health , and he was enjoying unprecedented riches , having lent his name to a hugely successful fat - free grill			2
@entity4 was stubbornly punished by @entity223 in his final fight in @entity221 , 1980 despite losing the most memorable fight in history , @entity30 still holds the highest respect for his tormentor but he remembered his old opponent , warmly and without rancour			1
‘ people think they know about him , but they do n’t appreciate just what a fighter he was ’ , he said			0
‘ i mean , i was pretty good			0
but @entity4 , he was something else			2
’ foolishly , i asked if he could imagine another @entity4 emerging in this generation or the next			2
‘ you mean , will we ever see anybody like that guy again ? he asked			0
he gave a small , pitying smile and said nothing			0
some questions really do n’t deserve an answer .			0

@entity4 will be remembered as the greatest heavyweight of all time
his most famous fight was the so - called ' @entity21 ' in @entity36
@entity4 reclaimed the title after knocking out @entity30 in the 8th round
years of punishment have taken their toll with @entity4 suffering from @entity5 and his health now *deteriorating* daily
