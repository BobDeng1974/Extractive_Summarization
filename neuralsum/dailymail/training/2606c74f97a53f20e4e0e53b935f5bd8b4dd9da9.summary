by @entity0 created : 11:18 est , 3 march 2014 an investment banker who claims a man with the same name stood in for him at his own wedding has failed in his attempt to avoid a big money divorce suit			0
former top - earning @entity8 banker @entity7 , 36 , told a judge his headhunter wife @entity10 ' married another @entity7 ' at a ceremony at a four star hotel			1
he said he was relaxing at home six hours away while the service was taking place			1
@entity7 ( left ) , 36 , told a judge his headhunter wife @entity10 ( right ) ' married another @entity7 ' at a ceremony at a four star hotel the high - flying city couple , who lived at @entity20 , @entity21 , met on @entity23 dating site @entity24			1
they were married on september 15 , 2003 , in the @entity23 city of @entity27 - but mr @entity7 insists he was ' not present at the ceremony '			2
he claimed his 33 - year - old wife could neither divorce him , nor claim any financial support , because they were never married in the first place			0
however , judge @entity33 granted mrs @entity34 a decree nisi last year after describing her husband as an ' unreliable ' witness and ruling that ' there was a valid marriage between the couple '			1
challenging that decision at the @entity42 , mr @entity7 pointed to a mysterious thumb print on his marriage certificate - and an absence of wedding photos - in a bid prove himself a bachelor			0
in his judgement , judge @entity49 also said that mr @entity7 was £ 300,000 in debt - despite earning £ 185,000 - a - year , plus bonuses , before he was made redundant			1
the @entity53 , in the @entity23 city of @entity27 , where the marriage between @entity34 and @entity7 took place his complaints were thrown out by the judge , who said he had ' no prospect ' of blocking his wife 's divorce petition			1
mr @entity7 met his wife on the @entity23 matrimonial website in 2003			2
he had then been accepted to study at the ' very prestigious ' @entity64 business school in @entity65 , having worked in @entity21 since 2002 , but agreed to meet his prospective bride back in his homeland			0
the pair became engaged three days after they met and a wedding was fixed for the following month with the consent of mrs @entity34 ’s senior army officer father			2
speaking after the hearing , mrs @entity34 said she was ' very happy ' at the outcome which would have ' massive implications ' for her future ' @entity77 and her parents were happy to go along with the plan			1
mr @entity7 was a well - educated young man with evidently good prospects in the well - paid world of international finance , ' judge @entity49 said in his ruling			1
he flew to @entity84 and his fiancee ’s family arranged a ' short marriage ceremony ' , in advance of the full festivities , in order to speed along her @entity92 visa application prior to the couple ’s flight to @entity95			0
however , the banker asserted that his wife tied the knot with an imposter at @entity27 ’s luxury @entity53 , claiming that he had been six hours ’ away in his home town , @entity102 , on the morning of the nuptials			0
' his case is that mrs @entity34 and he were not married on september 15 , 2003 ; he was not present at any ceremony that may have taken place on that day			1
his case is that she married another man that day , ' judge @entity49 explained			2
mr @entity7 said this meant his subsequent ' marriage ' , celebrated just three days later , was invalid - even though the groom ’s name on the wedding certificate for the previous ceremony matched his own			2
the pair moved to @entity92 and then the @entity115 , before their daughter , now six , was born in 2007			0
but their relationship ' irretrievably broke down ' and mrs @entity34 moved out of their @entity121 home in 2011			2
mr @entity7 claimed that he had ' not read the certificate carefully enough ' in 2003 and that the first time he noticed the discrepancies in the dates was more than a year after the relationship ended			0
judge @entity49 heard expert evidence that a photograph , supposedly depicting the groom on the marriage certificate , was not of mr @entity7 , and a thumb print on the document , which was purportedly his , belonged to someone else			1
the expert also highlighted a number of ' oddities ' about the registration of the marriage			0
' standing back and having regard to all the evidence and judge @entity49 ’s reasoning , i do not detect that he had any real difficulty in arriving at his conclusion			1
indeed , having regard to his finding that mr @entity7 ’s evidence pointed to him being unreliable , it seems to me that the conclusion to which he came was , in reality , the only one which was open to him ' - lord @entity153 nonetheless , the judge said that ' the overwhelming probability on all the evidence is that mrs @entity34 did not marry , and did not intend to marry , a different @entity7 on 15th september , 2003			1
' why should she do so ? why should she do this on september 15 and then marry mr @entity7 on september 18 and fly with him to @entity92 ? ' the judge asked			1
mr @entity7 was a ' highly educated and intelligent man ' who had worked for @entity159 , @entity160 and @entity8 and who was ' precise and careful '			0
but the judge said of him : ' i did not find him a satisfactory witness '			0
rejecting his claim that he did not check the marriage papers until long after the split , the judge said his evidence about that was ' unconvincing and implausible '			0
' i find there was a valid marriage between mrs @entity34 and mr @entity7 on september 15 , 2003 , in @entity27 , @entity23 , ' the judge concluded , before formally ending their union			1
on appeal , mr @entity7 argued in person that it ' simply was not possible ' that he could have made the ceremony in time , because he was in @entity102 at 9am on the day of the wedding			2
pointing to the lack of wedding snaps , he said : ' marriage is the one of the most sacred things in the @entity187 religion			0
if you say to someone there is a marriage without photographs , it simply does not add up			0
' but lord @entity153 said : ' standing back and having regard to all the evidence and judge @entity49 ’s reasoning , i do not detect that he had any real difficulty in arriving at his conclusion			1
' indeed , having regard to his finding that mr @entity7 ’s evidence pointed to him being unreliable , it seems to me that the conclusion to which he came was , in reality , the only one which was open to him			1
' the judge concluded : ' i ’m satisfied there is no prospect of success in this application			0
it must therefore be dismissed			0
' speaking after the hearing , mrs @entity34 said she was ' very happy ' at the outcome which would have ' massive implications ' for her future .			2

@entity7 told judge his wife @entity10 ' married another @entity7 '
he said he was at home six hours away while service was taking place
judge @entity225 granted mrs @entity34 a decree nisi last year
@entity228 has now thrown out an appeal by mr @entity7
an earlier *version* of this *article* stated that mr @entity7 made *statements* relating to his financial situation during the appeal hearing . in fact , the details of mr @entity7 ’s finances were referred to in judge @entity49 ’s judgement at the first hearing . mr @entity7 has also asked us to point out that the financial matters between him and mrs @entity34 were agreed before the appeal hearing took place . we are happy to *clarify* these points .
