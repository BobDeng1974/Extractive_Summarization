@entity0 is all set to be handed his @entity2 debut on wednesday night during their dead - rubber against @entity6			1
the 18 - year - old has yet to feature for the @entity8 but manager @entity9 confirmed that he will be given a chance in the @entity11			1
' i am so happy to give the kids a chance			0
he is an @entity16 player , 18 , completely made in @entity2			1
if he succeeds it 's good , ' @entity9 said			1
i think every manager in the world wants to bring young people up			0
' i can for example compare my first spell here and now , and now the quality of the young players is better			0
i 'm not saying they 're ready , or that they do n't need a transitional period with us or a couple of loans , but the quality is much better			0
i have conditions to do it			0
' go to other clubs , it 's clear to see it 's not easy to bring kids from the youth competitions to the top level , but i think every one of us has the same feeling			0
we want to do it			0
' the @entity2 manager has hailed the match against @entity6 as their ' @entity66 ' and believes that he finally feels the club have the quality of youngsters to have a real chance of breaking through			1
' the people in the academy feel they are working for something , ' @entity9 said			2

' if you do n't bring kids through the academy , the best thing is to close the academy			0
' if the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough , and you do n't bring kids up , then close the door and use the money to buy players			0
' you need to prove the academy works well and is worth it			0
it 's only possible if the first - team manager stays for a long time , which in this club in the last 10 years , was not possible			2
now i 'm trying to format @entity78 and other @entity114 in relation to my ideas , to his position			0
' imagine next week if there 's a different first - team manager with different ideas			2
some product , almost an added product , becomes an empty product and you start everything again			0
in this moment , the relation between the first - team and the academy is changing based on this stability that , at this moment , we are having			0
' the first time @entity78 trained with me was 18 months ago			0
in this moment , in the last two or three weeks , he 's been training every day			2
so , in 18 months , i think he remembers every word or feedback he 's had in first - team development			2

@entity203 , who is set to be handed his @entity2 debut against @entity6 on wednesday night , is regarded as one of the country 's brightest emerging talents			1
the 6ft 4in central midfielder , 18 , has earned rave reviews for his composed play and passing in central midfield and looks well - equipped to make the step up			0
hailing from @entity213 , south @entity214 , @entity0 first pulled on a blue shirt for the @entity217 team and is , as @entity9 said , very much ' made in @entity2			1
' graduating through the @entity25 schoolboy teams , he was appearing for the under - 18s three years ahead of schedule and captaining @entity223 schoolboys in the @entity224			1
the maturity and energy he demonstrated in the box - to - box midfield role won admiring glances from a number of big clubs , including @entity232 , and prompted @entity2 to tie down his future @entity21 lifts the @entity234 after @entity2 beat @entity235 in last season 's final the central midfielder in action for @entity2 's under 21 team in a @entity191 match against @entity242 last season @entity0 is always a willing outlet for the defenders and , with head up pressing forward , is adept at picking the right pass			1
tall and strong , he is rarely dispossessed either , but it is his composure on the ball that is most eye - catching			0
he never looks rushed and always seems to be in acres of space			0
the breakthrough season came in 2012 - 2013 , when @entity203 played a starring role as @entity2 progressed to the final of the @entity234 and the @entity257 , though both ended in defeat			2
