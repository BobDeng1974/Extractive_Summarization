a new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases , it has emerged			2
an official source told @entity7 that the @entity8 will conduct drone flights between 1am and 4am over the coming weeks in restricted airspace over @entity11 during missions , agents will look at how to interfere with rogue consumer - level drones , which commonly carry video cameras but are powerful enough to carry small amounts of explosives			1
the challenge for the @entity8 is quickly detecting a rogue drone flying near the @entity20 or the president 's location , then within moments either hacking it to seize control over its flight or jamming its signal to send it off course or make it crash			1
growing trend : a new series of secret government tests will investigate how to thwart the threat from civilian drones as usage increases , it has emerged the @entity8 has said only that it will openly test drones over @entity11 , but it declined to provide details such as when it will fly , how many drones , over what parts of the city , for how long and for what purposes			1
it decided to tell the public in advance about the tests out of concern that people who saw the drones might be alarmed , particularly in the wake of the drones spotted recently over @entity47 at night			0
flying overnight also diminishes the chances that radio jamming would accidentally affect nearby businesses , drivers , pedestrians and tourists			0
it is illegal under the @entity55 to sell or use signal jammers except for narrow purposes by government agencies			0
depending on a drone 's manufacturer and capabilities , its flight - control and video - broadcasting systems commonly use the same common radio frequencies as popular @entity66 and @entity67 technologies			2
jamming by the @entity8 - depending on how powerfully or precisely it works - could disrupt nearby internet networks or phone conversations until it 's turned off			1
testing in the real - world environment around the @entity20 would reveal unexpected effects on jamming efforts from nearby buildings , monuments or tall trees			1
signals emanating from an inbound drone - such as coming from a video stream back to its pilot - could allow the @entity8 to detect and track it			1
federal agencies generally need approval to jam signals from the @entity85 telecommunications advisory agency , the @entity86 's @entity84			2
found : the recreational drone that landed on the @entity88 is seen in this @entity8 handout that agency declined to tell the @entity7 whether the @entity8 sought permission because it said such requests are not routinely made public			1
the @entity93 has confirmed it formally authorized the @entity8 to fly the drones and granted it a special waiver to fly them over @entity11			1
the agency declined to provide specifics about the secret program			2
in january , a wayward quadcopter drone , piloted by an off - duty @entity85 intelligence employee , landed on the @entity20 lawn			1
at the time , the @entity8 said the errant landing appeared to be accidental and was not considered a security threat			1
the agency had been looking at security issues surrounding drones before the january crash , but the crash of that drone led the agency to focus more attention on security issues surrounding small , unmanned aircraft that can be hard to detect			1
previously published reports have disclosed that the @entity8 already uses jammers in presidential and vice presidential motorcades to disrupt signals that might detonate hidden remotely triggered improvised explosive devices			1
the @entity8 , in conjunction with other inter-agency partners , will conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems , in the coming days and weeks			1
because these exercises will be conducted within the normally flight restricted areas in the @entity11 area , they have been carefully planned and will be tightly controlled			0
in preparation for these exercises the @entity8 has coordinated with all appropriate federal , state and local agencies			2
researchers with the @entity138 's science and technology directorate are working on strategies to interdict an unauthorized drone flying inside security areas			0
the research arm of @entity138 is trying to balance security concerns of the small , hard - to - detect devices , with the burgeoning commercial use and interests of hobbyists			0
likewise , the @entity84 said last week it 's studying how the @entity85 can resolve privacy risks with increasing use of drones			0
the @entity138 hosted a two - day meeting last month with industry officials , law enforcement and academics to discuss balancing security and commercial interests and establishing security practices			0
days later , the @entity8 , which is part of the @entity138 , distributed a three - sentence press release saying it will ' conduct a series of exercises involving unmanned aircraft systems , in the coming days and weeks			2
' trying to keep drones out of a secure area can be tricky			0
there are basically three ways to stop a drone , said @entity168 , a staff technologist at the @entity169 : block the radio signals linking the drone to its controller , hack the aircraft 's control signals and trick it into believing it is somewhere else , or physically disable it			0
some drone manufacturers program a ' geo fence ' - location coordinates their drones treat as off - limits and refuse to fly past - into the drone 's programming			0
police could physically knock a drone out of the air with a projectile or use a net to catch it			0
' if it were me that would actually be the first thing i would think about doing , ' @entity168 said			0
' you would have to basically encase the @entity20 in this net			2
it sure would n't look pretty , but in some ways it would be the most effective way			0

@entity8 has become increasingly worried about the threat to president from @entity200
agency was embarrassed by drone that crash landed in late january on @entity20 lawn
