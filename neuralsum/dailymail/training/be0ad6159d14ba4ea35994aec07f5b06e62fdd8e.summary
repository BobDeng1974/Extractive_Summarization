by @entity0 it 's one of the world 's best - loved stories - how captain @entity4 , his ex-nun wife @entity5 and their large brood of children sing their way out of bankruptcy and escaped @entity12 - occupied @entity11 , where the hills are alive with the sound of music , to start a new life in @entity17			1
the family 's story is basically true and was turned into an @entity21 - winning film with @entity22 and @entity23 in the leading roles , although the facts were considerably stretched by @entity26			1
three generations later , and some 60 years since the original @entity35 last sang together , four of the captain and @entity5 's great - grandchildren - @entity27 , 25 , @entity30 , 23 , @entity31 , 22 and their 19 - year - old brother august - have revived the family 's musical heritage and are singing together			1
the @entity4 descendents @entity27 , august , @entity31 and @entity38 , have come together to sing once more their grandfather was @entity41 , born in 1915 , and renamed as @entity42 in @entity44 movie			1
@entity41 's parents were captain @entity4 and his first wife @entity47 , who died of scarlet fever in 1922 , leaving her seven children motherless			1
i meet the young @entity35 in @entity51 , @entity52 , where they now live after their father had settled in @entity55			1
they 've been singing together for 13 years , and i ask if they feel it was destined that this was what they would do ? @entity31 says , ' i do n't think so			1
we were just children having fun , with no sense of destiny			1
' explains @entity30 , ' @entity41 was a very quiet man , and did n't tell many stories			1
he died in 2007 , but long after he retired he 'd come to our house to teach us @entity11 yodelling songs and that inspired our love of music			1
but there was no pressure on us to carry on the family tradition			1
' ' when we told our parents what we wanted to do they were surprised			1
they said , " really , you want to start singing ? " ' says @entity81			1
' we all loved it so much and we all loved being together			1
' august adds , ' we can definitely get tired of each other but because we have the same goal we want to make this work			1
we decided a long time ago if we just learn to get along we can do fun things			1
' august , who seems older than his 19 years , wrote some of the songs on @entity90 , the album they 've just made with the band @entity91			1
' we do n't plan to sing together for the rest of our lives , ' says @entity31			1
' for us it 's just a fun experience , ' adds @entity81 , ' but for our great - grandparents it was a means of survival			1
' @entity81 , august , @entity31 and @entity30 's direct descendents inspired one of the best loved films of all time after his wife @entity47 's death , captain @entity4 employed @entity105 , a novice nun , as a tutor for his daughter , also called @entity5 , because she was ill. in the film version , little @entity5 's name is changed to @entity110 , and the older woman is the family governess			1
she and @entity4 eventually married in 1927 ( not 1938 as in the film ) , and had three more children			1
when @entity4 lost most of his fortune in a bank crash , @entity5 turned the family hobby - singing - into a career and they performed to great acclaim all over @entity121			1
in march 1938 , when the @entity123 marched into @entity124 , pressure was put on @entity4 , a @entity125 naval hero , to command a ship under @entity127			1
but he refused , and the @entity128 decided to leave @entity11			1
@entity5 arranged a concert tour in @entity17 , where they planned to start a new life			1
but unlike the film 's version , they did not need to climb any mountains to escape			2
@entity105 , daughter of @entity11 baron @entity136 , was the last surviving @entity4 singer			1
she died earlier this year according to the movie , the family give their guards the slip after a show			1
they 're discovered hiding by a young @entity12 who threatens to shoot the captain , but he disarms the boy			2
the @entity128 make their escape in a waiting car			2
the @entity123 try to make chase but their cars have been sabotaged by nuns			2
the family then hike over the @entity154 to @entity155 and freedom			2
in fact there was no @entity12 boy , no chase			2
the family left by train ( the local station was directly behind their house ) and made their way to @entity168 and then to @entity17 via @entity169 , where they soon emulated their @entity121 singing success			1
@entity81 says , ' they came to @entity17 and sang for many years to make a living			2
our grandfather @entity41 was about 40 when he finally stopped in 1955			2
they had no expectations that any of their descendants would start singing			1
it was a real surprise to the rest of the family when we did			2
' @entity5 wrote a book about the @entity105 which found its way to @entity186 , and then she sold the rights for £ 3,000 to @entity26 to make @entity44 movie			2
' i never met my great - grandmother @entity5 , ' says @entity81			2
' she died in 1987 , a year before i was born			1
we know she was a little impulsive , but without her the family would never have survived as a single group			2
the captain would have been taken off to war if it was n't for the singing			1
' the real @entity5 could never have foreseen the impact the film would have , and made it clear she did not approve of the exaggerations			2
@entity22 portrayed the captain as brusque and harsh with his children			2
' our great - aunt @entity47 ( renamed @entity205 in the film ) said he was n't like that , ' says @entity31			2
' he really did love his children and was fun to be with			2
apparently he packed a really good snowball and played with the kids a lot			2
but he did blow a whistle to summon them			2
' the butler , who was a nazi although his first loyalty was to the family , warned our great - grandfather that they were planning on taking him off to a camp , ' @entity31 continues			0
' they packed up little bags and pretended they were going on a picnic so neighbours would n't be suspicious			0
the house they lived in was later occupied by the @entity123			0
afterwards , they got it back but @entity5 gave it to a religious order and it became a convent			0
the @entity105 at their home in @entity236 in 1946 ' now it 's a hotel			0
@entity5 never turned her back on her religion			0
she did missionary trips and remained devout and never had much money			0
' after touring @entity17 , their great - grandparents bought land in @entity236			0
' they built a music camp and a skiing camp , which are run now by our @entity247 , ' says @entity81			0
@entity44 has touched millions of people 's hearts			0
just say ' @entity251 , a deer … ' and you 're flushed with nostalgia and tunes you can sing in your sleep			0
when they first watched it , were the young @entity35 aware that the little boy playing @entity42 was portraying their grandfather ? ' our parents told us , " that 's your grandfather , " ' says @entity81			0
' but the film had been recorded on two tapes and we lost the second one			0
the first one ended where @entity5 flees the house ( confused about her feelings after dancing with her employer , the captain )			0
we did n't know what happened next			0
' they are proud of their legacy , though			1
@entity30 says , ' our great - grandfather stood up to the @entity123 and said , " no , i wo n't be part of what you 're trying to do			0
" that 's what meant so much to us and it did make us feel there was a message we were carrying on			0
' the last surviving @entity4 singer @entity5 ( stepdaughter of the @entity5 played by @entity23 ) died earlier this year			1
' we were close to her , ' says @entity81			0
' for us it 's fun , for them it was a means of survival ' ' she would visit us and she was the most cheerful great - aunt			0
she was always laughing and had this twinkle in her eye			0
she would carry her accordion and sing beautiful @entity11 folk songs , and she taught us @entity11 folk dancing			1
@entity5 was the last of that generation who remembered all the old stories			0
' she told us the captain was completely heartbroken when his first wife passed away			0
they went on camping trips and would play instruments , but it was their stepmother @entity5 who taught them how to harmonise			0
' @entity31 says of their great - aunt @entity5 , ' she 'd always wear a braid of hair over her head , an incredible hairdo			0
she had a good sense of humour too			0
' @entity81 adds , ' she would come to our shows and when august took a bow at the end she would say , " i am glad that your hair did n't fall off because it looks like a little roof of straw			0
" he was so blond			0
' the four siblings met the band leader of @entity91 at a @entity331 lighting event and they began working together			0
he had some original @entity105 records in his collection , and suggested they do in @entity335 ( in the @entity336 ) , a @entity338 lullaby that to the surprise of the youngsters had been a hit for their great - grandparents			0
' we had no idea , ' says @entity81			0
the album includes a couple of august 's compositions and some @entity44 classics - among them @entity349 , which they sing with @entity350 , who played @entity351 , their great - aunt @entity47 , in the film			1
they met her in 2010 when they were invited onto the @entity357 to meet the cast who played the family in the film			0
@entity23 was queen - like , they say			0
they all seem to have wisdom and naivety in equal parts			0
they 've travelled the world and seen a lot , but at the same time seen nothing at all			0
it 's as if they 're channelling another age			0
their songs could easily have been sung in the 1930s and they would still bring the hills alive with the sound of music			0
@entity90 is out on 5 may .			1

the last surviving @entity4 singer died earlier this year
now the @entity4 descendents carry on the legacy by singing once more
they release their own album , @entity90 on 5 may
