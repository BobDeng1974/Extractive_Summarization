refreshing : @entity18 shows off his spring / summer collection at @entity20 in september personal passion : @entity25 colours , zip - up tops and angular collars add a sporty twist to the ensemble it said : ' our press day tomorrow in the @entity18 store is cancelled due to the theft of the spring / summer 2012 collections during its transfer from @entity35			1
' there 's no indication as yet on who was behind the heist or how such a daring raid could have been pulled off given the logistics required to lift the collection from a train			2
setback : fashion designer @entity18 lost his entire spring / summer collection in the train heist as the pieces are effectively worthless because they are not yet in production , it has led to fears that counterfeiters may be involved			1
the collection , which consisted of drop - waist skirts , cellophane cocktail dresses and translucent and tinsel fabrics , attempted to give the ' feel of a @entity58 dance hall ' , @entity18 said of his show in september			2
now editors wo n't be able to see the designs , which could mean fewer editorial placements for the brand in @entity3 publications			0
when the collection debuted during @entity20 , it was described by @entity67 / the @entity69 â€™s @entity68 as ' a refreshing collection because it went its own way			0
' he added : ' the designer was unwilling to fall under the spell of fuchsia , cobalt blue , and bright orange			0
this was a personal passion			0
' the suspected theft is further embarrassment for @entity18 after an advert for his perfume oh , @entity84 was banned because it appeared to ' sexualise a child '			0
it featured 17 - year - old actress @entity87 , but she looked younger in the magazine advert , where she was sitting on the floor with the perfume bottle between her thighs .			0
