no compensation : @entity1 was acquitted of murder the man sensationally acquitted of murdering @entity4 yesterday lost his @entity6 bid for compensation – on the grounds that another jury could have found him guilty			1
two judges ruled @entity1 , who spent eight years in jail before being cleared of the tv presenter ’s killing at a retrial , was not eligible for up to £ 500,000 as a victim of a ‘ miscarriage of justice ’			1
lawyers for the convicted sex offender claimed that the justice secretary had unfairly and unlawfully decided mr @entity1 , 52 , was ‘ not innocent enough to be compensated ’			1
but in ruling that mr @entity1 had ‘ failed the legal test ’ for an award , @entity21 and mr @entity22 said the minister who had opposed his compensation bid was ‘ entirely justified in the conclusion he reached ’			1
they added : ‘ there was indeed a case upon which a reasonable jury , properly directed , could have convicted the claimant of murder			0
’ crimewatch presenter @entity35 , 37 , was shot outside her home in @entity37 , south - west @entity38 in april 1999			0
the murder prompted an enormous inquiry by @entity40 and resulted in unemployed loner mr @entity1 being convicted in july 2001			2
he was granted a retrial on appeal , and received a unanimous acquittal by a jury in august 2008			1
mr @entity1 then made a claim for compensation for lost earnings and wrongful imprisonment , but this was rejected in january 2010			2
he went to court again to seek a reconsideration of his case , which could have opened the way for him to claim as much as £ 500,000			0
his barrister , @entity55 , insisted that the original decision to refuse compensation was ‘ defective and contrary to natural justice ’ , arguing that for more than 30 years , those acquitted on retrials in similar circumstances had been compensated			1
shot dead on her own doorstep : @entity64 presenter @entity4 was 37 when she was murdered in @entity38 in 1999 previously , compensation was only awarded for a miscarriage of justice if a claimant could effectively prove they were innocent			2
but a @entity71 hearing in 2011 widened this to say a person is eligible for compensation if they can prove that no set of circumstances could possibly lead to their conviction by a jury			0
the judges ruled mr @entity1 ’s case did not pass this second test			2
his solicitor , @entity84 , said : ‘ we are very disappointed with the judgment and shall be applying for permission to leapfrog the @entity87 to have the matter heard before the @entity71			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s action was one of five test cases to decide who is now entitled to payments in ‘ miscarriage of justice ’ cases			2
decisions to refuse payouts in all five cases were defended by current justice secretary @entity100 in a three - day hearing last october			1
only one claimant , @entity102 , who spent eight years in jail for murder before being freed by the @entity87 in 2009 , was successful			1
the judges ruled the decision to refuse compensation was flawed and must be reconsidered			1
mr @entity1 – who has a record for attempted rape and indecent assault – and the three other claimants failed in their challenges			0
a @entity114 spokesman said : ‘ we welcome the @entity6 ’s decision in these cases , in that it confirms that our decision not to grant compensation to the named individuals was correct			1
’ residential street : miss @entity4 was shot outside her house in @entity123 in @entity37 in april 1999 in 2010 , the @entity124 revealed how former deputy headmaster @entity125 had been refused compensation for the six years he spent in jail accused of murdering foster daughter @entity128			0
he had sought up to £ 500,000 damages for the term he served before he was acquitted			0
but although mr @entity125 said he fitted ‘ all the criteria ’ for a payout , the @entity114 rejected his request after officials assessed the case			0
rules stated that applicants for miscarriage of justice compensation had to show they were ‘ clearly innocent ’ to receive money .			0

@entity1 , 52 , acquitted of 1999 murder in august 2008
judges rule that justice secretary *'s* decision to refuse payout was justified
three others with *quashed* convictions lose @entity6 compensation bid
but one , @entity102 , won a similar bid after eight years behind bars
