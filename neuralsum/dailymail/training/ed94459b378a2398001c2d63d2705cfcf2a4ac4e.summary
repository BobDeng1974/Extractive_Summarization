when @entity1 , from @entity2 , gets into bed with husband @entity4 , sleeping is usually the last thing on her mind			1
but while mrs @entity1 and her husband of 38 years enjoy their time in the sack , neighbours have been left fuming after being forced to endure years of banging sounds and screaming			1
30 visits from the police later , the 53 - year - old was slapped with a four - year asbo and even endured a 12 - week jail term			1
but , she says , she has no regrets - and no plans to stop			0
' as far as i 'm concerned , that 's what you should be doing			0
it 's not as if i 'm having sex and think : " oh , i 'm making too much noise			2
i better be quiet "			0
' mrs @entity1 's problems began when she and her husband moved into a quiet terrace of @entity39 homes in @entity2			1
their bedroom backed onto a neighbour 's but the couple , who will appear on @entity45 's asbo and @entity47 documentary , chose to splash out on a bed with an iron headboard anyway			1
complaints from irate locals soon began to flood in but it was n't just the headboard that annoyed neighbours - mrs @entity1 's habit of screaming loudly during the act also proved a problem			1
' it was a different bed from the one we have now , ' she says , unrepentantly			0
' we broke that one			0
it was a metal headboard so it used to bang on the wall			2
' banned : @entity1 is not allowed to shout , scream or vocalise during regular sex sessions with husband @entity4 ' there was no carpet back then , so when you have sex , the bed goes back and forward , ' adds mr @entity70 , who describes the complaints as ' silliness '			1
finally , after scores of visits from the police , mrs @entity1 was handed a noise abatement order - later upgraded to an asbo after she breached the order five times			1
the asbo forbade her from ' shouting , screaming and vocalisation ' during sex or from playing loud music			1
in a bid to get around the restrictions , mrs @entity1 , who is unemployed , switched her sex sessions to the morning - but neighbours , who complained she was noisy enough to drown out their tvs , were left unimpressed			1
' i was n't supposed to make excessive noise that could be heard in a neigbouring property or outside , ' she explains			2
' as soon as i got it , i said to them [ the police ] : " i guess i 'm going to get arrested then "			0
' i think we were having sex when they came to arrest me , ' she remembers			2
' i think we 'd just finished , ' adds husband @entity4			0
in court : @entity1 and her husband leave court after she was sentenced to her first prison term in 2009 not happy : @entity1 and @entity4 leave court for the second time a year later having received another jail term misery : @entity105 is one of the neighbours whose life was made a misery by the @entity70 's noisy nocturnal antics ' the lads in blue were knocking on the door and i let them in and they asked me what we were doing , ' he continues			1
' and i said we were having sex in our own house			2
' ' when we got to the police station , the [ policeman ] said : " we 're going to have to stop laughing now we 're going in " , ' adds mrs @entity1			1
' they were all trying not to laugh			0
' what followed , however , was no laughing matter			0
mrs @entity1 was taken to court , handed an eight - week suspended prison sentence and was forced to live in a bail hostel for weeks			1
a year later , and after scores more complaints and visits from the police , mrs @entity1 was again arrested for breaching her asbo following two police call outs in two days			1
again , she was handed a suspended sentence , this time for 12 weeks , and sent to live in a bail hostel where she was held alongside serious criminals , including murderers			2
it proved an interesting experience			0
' i would have been judgmental about people who went to prison before i got locked up , ' she explains			0
' but then you go in there and you hear the stories of why they 're there , it makes you realise that it could be anyone who ends up there			0
' but despite her convictions , mrs @entity1 , who has since bought a less noisy wooden bed , remains adamant that she 's done nothing wrong			1
' i do n't see why i should stop having sex in my own house with my husband of 38 years , ' she complains			2
' i 'm sure there could be a lot worse things i could be doing			0
they all thought it was stupid i was in prison			0
' i mean i was in the same prison as people like @entity166 for making a noise when i have sex			0
there could be a real crime going on while they 're busy arresting me			0
