@entity0 could be on his way out of @entity2 because he is ' more hassle than he is worth ' , according to former @entity4 star @entity3			2
@entity0 scored the only goal in @entity4 's 1 - 0 win over @entity7 , but in the process attracted controversy by grabbing the ball off captain @entity11 to score from the spot			1
and @entity3 believes his apparent lack of respect will leave @entity4 boss @entity15 to decide he can do without the @entity17 striker			1
@entity0 takes the ball from @entity11 despite the stand - in skipper 's initial protests @entity21 looked furious at @entity0 for questioning stand - in captain @entity11 's authority ' the problem you have with @entity0 is i do n't think he has got a lot of respect for anybody , ' said @entity3 on @entity29			1
' he has worked with some of the best managers in ( @entity32 ) @entity31 , ( @entity34 ) @entity33 , ( @entity36 ) @entity35 , everybody he has worked with has tried with this man but nobody seems to get to the bottom of it			0
' the objective is to put the ball into the back of the net , thankfully that is what he did , but it is not nice to see players arguing like that on the field			0
all was well in the end though when @entity0 fired the penalty into @entity55 's bottom corner for a 1 - 0 win @entity57 called @entity58 , and @entity3 said his team - mates do n't enjoy his company ' he is an incredibly confident penalty taker and very good at it , but it is that lack of respect that he has			1
' @entity3 also suggested that @entity0 , who cost @entity4 Â£ 16million this summer and has scored just one @entity65 goal , has not justified his place in the squad			0
' i do n't see long - term he will be at @entity2 , i really do n't , ' continued @entity3			0
' he has scored a couple of goals in fairness , the goals against @entity70 and yesterday were important , but i am sure @entity15 is thinking he is more hassle than he is worth because he has n't produced the quality you would like and when you look at other players around him they do n't seem to enjoy his company on the field			0
' @entity0 sought out @entity11 after scoring the goal and later thanked him with this @entity82 post @entity0 's actions angered some of his team - mates , and the striker 's long - term future could be in doubt			2
