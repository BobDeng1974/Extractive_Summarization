by @entity0 published : 10:16 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 11:52 est , 6 march 2013 laughable : @entity1 , owner of @entity2 , was shocked when he received a cheque for 12p seven years after being a victim of crime court officials have been accused of ' judicial overkill ' today after spending seven years chasing 12p in compensation from a criminal before handing it to his bemused victim			1
book shop owner @entity1 , 58 , had no idea he had lost £ 3 in a sponsorship scam in 2006 - yet investigators were determined he would get his money back			1
although the culprit was jailed in 2006 , officials at @entity19 's @entity18 pored over paperwork relating to the case			2
they went through a raft of bogus sponsorship forms signed by mr @entity1 and other unwitting victims of serial conman @entity26 and then investigated whether the names and addresses on the list of sponsors checked out			1
after establishing their identities , they split the amount and made out cheques for 12p to 34 victims - placing first class stamps on each later at a cost of 59p each			1
when mr @entity1 tried to find out what the money was for , @entity39 went to the expense of sending him another letter apologising for sending him the 12p cheque			1
mr @entity46 in @entity47 , @entity45 said : ' i ca n't imagine the waste of public money that has gone into administering the cheque and now sending me a letter to apologise for it			0
' the fact is i had forgotten all about losing this money yet these people have spent many man hours sorting out a payment which literally is n't worth the paper it is written on			0
i would happily have written off three pounds and frankly i ca n't understand all the bother that went into investigating it			0
the irony is it would cost me more money to cash the cheque than the cheque is actually worth			0
pay - off : this cheque for 12p was the result of years of work by civil servants who were accused of ' judicial overkill ' today do n't spend it all at once : the cost of the stamp used to send it to him was more than the money he received funny : ' it was ridiculous to send out a cheque for 12p , especially as it would cost me 63p to cash it , ' the book shop owner said ' as far as i 'm concerned i 'm going to frame it and put it up on the wall of the book shop as an example of judicial overkill			1
had i known what the court people were doing i would have told them not to bother for such a small amount of money			0
' criminal : @entity96 had scammed dozens of people , claiming he was going to do parachute jumps for good causes and @entity1 had sponsored him £ 3 in 2006 father of three mr @entity1 was one of a number of victims of conman @entity26 who scammed dozens of people , claiming he was going to do parachute jumps for good causes - only to pocket the cash			1
mr @entity1 sponsored @entity26 for £ 3 in 2006 after the conman came into his shop falsely claiming he was raising money for a homeless charity			1
@entity26 was later jailed for four months later that year after admitting deception but @entity112 magistrates ordered he pay compensation to his victims			1
' the whole thing is just laughable			0
it was ridiculous to send out a cheque for 12p , especially as it would cost me 63p to cash it , ' mr @entity1 said			2
it is understood that court officers chased the compensation ordered by magistrates and whatever money was recovered was split equally between victims			0
it is not not known why it took so long for the money to come through			0
a spokesman for @entity19 's @entity18 said : ' @entity39 uses all means at its disposal to ensure compensation ordered by the court is paid			0
' normally payments are not sent to victims until a minimum of £ 5 has been collected			2
the 12p cheque was issued in error			2
@entity39 has apologised to the individual concerned			0
' sorry ! the letter sent to @entity1 apologising for sending him the tiny amount and explaining they always try to track down compensation for victims @entity26 , now 30 , was jailed four times - for four months in 2006 , another four months in 2007 , 16 months in 2008 and a further four months in february 2010			1
he would knock on the doors of the victims , claimed he was doing parachute jumps or sponsored swims to raise money for the @entity152 homeless charity in @entity153 or the @entity154			2
he was caught for the sixth time in 2011 after being shopped by his sister for pretending to take part in a sponsored swim - but was given a 12 - month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and a three - month electronically tagged evening curfew			2
it emerged he had carried out the fraud to fund an addiction to heroin .			0

@entity1 , 58 , was handed the cheque but had no idea he *'d* been *robbed*
@entity26 had been sponsored £ 3 for a *skydive* in 2006 but pocketed it
after an investigation costing ' thousands ' 34 victims got 12p each
*bungling* civil servants have apologised for seven - year probe and tiny sum
