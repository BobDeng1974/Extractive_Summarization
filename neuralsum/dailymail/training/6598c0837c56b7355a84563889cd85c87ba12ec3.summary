@entity2 's state - run @entity71 news agency said the switch - off could have been caused by a problem with the engine or the guidance system			2
the rocket contained 172 tonnes of highly toxic heptyl propellant , @entity25 emergencies minister @entity76 told an emergency government meeting			1

it was raining in the area at the time so toxic clouds would probably not reach the town of @entity24 some 38 miles away			2
a file picture taken on may 15 shows one of the @entity2 's built unmanned @entity2 @entity20 carrier rockets rising at a launch pad before its launch however , the authorities instructed locals to stay at home and not to open windows			1
they also ordered shops to close , said @entity25 interior minister @entity113			0
the estimated loss from the three satellites , meant for @entity2 's troubled glonass satellite navigation system , was about $ 200 million , @entity17 - 24 reported			0
@entity2 plans to spend more than 300 billion roubles ( $ 9.1 billion ) by 2020 on @entity117 , its answer to the @entity120 gps system			0
the system , first conceived by the @entity122 more than 40 years ago , has been plagued by failed launches , including one in 2010 in which three satellites were also lost , and by suspicions of corruption and embezzlement			0
its chief designer was dismissed last year during a fraud investigation			0
the @entity20 rocket , known at the time under its @entity133 , made its first test flights in the mid- 1960s			2

but it was never deployed as a nuclear weapon			0
several crashes of @entity20 rockets accompanied by spills of heptyl have led to temporary strains in relations between @entity2 and @entity25			2
@entity2 is increasing spending on space and plans to send a probe to the moon in 2015 , but the pioneering programme that put the first man in space in 1961 has been plagued in recent years by setbacks , including botched satellite launches and a failed attempt to send a probe to a moon of @entity159 .			0

television footage showed the @entity20 booster rocket veering off - course
seconds later it exploded landing near to the launch pad
the explosion left to a large spill of highly toxic rocket propellant
