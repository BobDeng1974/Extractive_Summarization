happier times : the couple were married for almost 20 years and had five children together ranging in age : their kids are aged between eight years and 15 years of age ' he has known @entity47 , he knows him through tennis , through coaching him , ' @entity37 told reporter @entity102			2
' we get no financial support at all , ' she also told @entity106			0
@entity37 claims her concern is that the large sum owning to her has amassed over the past year , which she says ' worries me considerably in that my youngest is only 8 - he has many more years where he needs support from his father			2
' ' the children also have no emotional support from him			0
he does not ring them , nor come and see them , ' she said , adding ' they do not receive a card [ for birthdays ] in the mail , not even a phone call			0
' ' he 's never played an active , massive role in their lives anyway ... but basically his role now is non-existent , he 's pretty much wiped his hands clean of the children , ' @entity37 said			0
upset : the blonde single mother says she went on the show for the tell all after @entity0 's allegedly blocked her calls and the numbers of their two eldest daughters the blonde single mother also claimed that the lack of funds has reached a point where it 's ' significantly impacting on the children '			1
@entity37 not only took aim at @entity0 during the interview but also at the @entity143 and producers of @entity87			0
' it seems there is little they [ child support agency ] can do , irrespective of him being in the print that he 's working at three private schools doing tennis , irrespective of his face being on @entity87			2
