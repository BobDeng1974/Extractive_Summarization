@entity1 manager @entity0 has admitted that @entity2 might be his best striker but insists the @entity4 captain has to continue playing where it suits the team			1
@entity9 's decision to play @entity2 in midfield for the majority of this season has come under scrutiny with @entity1 accused of playing dull football despite a run of just one defeat in 18 matches			1
@entity19 manager @entity18 has confirmed @entity2 – who is closing on the all - time goalscoring records for @entity1 and @entity19 - will operate as a striker at international level , saying : ' he 's a goalscorer , is n't he ? ' @entity2 has looked out of place playing in midfield under @entity0 this season @entity2 's heat map against @entity25 shows that he spent the majority of the game behind the halfway line the @entity30 manager insists he has been forced to accommodate @entity2 to best suit the team the @entity1 boss , whose side travel to @entity35 @entity34 on monday night for a potentially awkward @entity37 fifth round tie , has tried to explain his policy on @entity2			1
he said he understood @entity18 's position regarding @entity19 but argued he had a different set of issues at @entity1 , with @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 also available up front			1
' maybe , he ( @entity2 ) is the best striker but i have to look at where a player can make the biggest contribution , and compare that to other players also			0
' the composition of the team is more important than the individual player			0
i am sorry but that 's the way it is			0
@entity2 probably gives more contribution to mr @entity18 playing in a striker 's position , and i 'd also put him there if i was coach of @entity19			1
' he has to compare @entity2 with the strikers he can put in the line - up , and that is a consideration i have to make at @entity1 and my consideration is a different one			2
i have to choose between @entity43 , @entity42 and all the other strikers i have			0
' @entity9 's admission that @entity2 is not playing in midfield through a lack of ability as a centre - forward does raise doubts about how he views some of @entity1 's big - money signings in central areas			1
@entity19 manager @entity18 ( centre ) has criticised @entity9 's use of his leading striker @entity9 also has to find a place for forwards @entity80 and @entity82 in his team struggling @entity43 will be judged on more than just goals alone , insists @entity9 @entity85 ( £ 38million ) , @entity86 ( £ 28million ) and @entity44 ( £ 27million ) are considered inferior midfield players to @entity2 and the @entity1 boss clearly does n't see @entity89 ( £ 60million ) or @entity90 ( £ 18million ) as the answer in central midfield			1
@entity44 's size and physical strength may get him a start at @entity96 having played an important part in seeing off another lower league team , @entity98 , in the last round			0
though youngster @entity45 is pushing for a start , there may be another chance given to @entity103 striker @entity43 whose four goals this season have been a poor return given the hype when he signed on deadline day in the summer			0
with @entity42 due to be rested for a minor ailment , @entity0 defended @entity43 's contribution			1
@entity1 have to decide by april whether to turn his loan move from @entity112 into a permanent £ 43million deal			0
' i shall not only judge on the goals			0
it is a bigger view than that , ' said @entity0			0
' there are more aspects for a striker , an assist is an aspect and being available on the pitch for your fellow players is also an aspect			0
' you have seen the header back for @entity128 ( for @entity1 's opening goal against @entity25 on wednesday night ) was from @entity43			2
' despite @entity1 being in a top - four position having finished seventh last season under @entity133 , @entity0 has faced plenty of criticism in the past week with @entity137 manager @entity136 saying the team played long - ball football last weekend , and ex-united great @entity140 saying the players looked miserable			2
@entity2 has been preferred to using players like @entity85 ( left ) and @entity44 in midfield @entity2 celebrates scoring after scoring his last goal against @entity145 at @entity4 on @entity146 goalkeeper @entity147 has been @entity1 's best performing player by far this season the @entity30 manager , who is used to working in high - pressure arenas like @entity150 and @entity151 , is coming out fighting , and not even @entity1 's best player this season goalkeeper @entity147 is exempt			1
asked if the @entity154 had won a lot of points for @entity1 this season , @entity0 snapped back : ' i think he does n't save many points because he is my goalkeeper and his obligation is to hold balls			2
and you are thinking that is an exception for other goalkeepers and it is not like that , i am sorry for that			0
' @entity1 have not won the @entity37 since 2004 and the competition represents their only chance of winning their first trophy of the @entity174 @entity173 era			2
@entity9 is expected to name a strong line - up – with @entity2 again in midfield – though he is missing @entity177 ( calf ) and @entity179 ( ankle ) with @entity181 ( head ) doubtful .			1

@entity2 has found himself playing in midfield under @entity0
@entity19 boss @entity18 has criticised the @entity30 's decision
@entity9 must also fit in the likes of @entity80 and @entity42
