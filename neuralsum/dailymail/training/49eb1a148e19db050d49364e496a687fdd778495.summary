lord chief justice , lord @entity0 called for clearer rules to prevent major trials being heard entirely in secret defendants should ' never , ever ' be allowed to remain anonymous during their trial , the lord chief justice warned today			1
lord @entity0 , the most senior judge in @entity8 and @entity9 , called for clearer rules to prevent major trials being heard entirely in secret			1
his warning that ' justice that is not open , is not good justice ' , comes as @entity16 law student @entity15 , who is accused of targeting former prime minister @entity17 , faces retrial after a jury was discharged in the @entity16 's first part - secret terror trial			1
@entity15 was formerly known in the court case as @entity22 and his co-defendant @entity23 , 26 , who admitted possessing a bomb - making document , as @entity27			1
the exceptional and controversial arrangements for the secret trial were made after a media challenge at the @entity31 against the entire case being heard in secret on grounds of national security			2
as well as opening up the case to partial reporting , it led to the defendants being named in public for the first time			2
speaking at his annual press conference , the lord chief justice said : ' we ought to have much clearer rules as to what we need - much clearer guidance			1
' this is something that should be looked at and looked at properly			0
' my experience of the intelligence services is actually that when you make a full explanation of what are the principles of open justice they actually believe it - not as much - but they do believe in it			0
' we need to get the ground rules straight			0
we can not have something like this in my view happen again			0
' lord @entity0 went on : ' what we do n't want in my view is a situation where you have anonymous defendants and that the matter has to come to the @entity69 to resolve it			1
' there ought to be very much clearer guidelines and rules so that the prospect of an anonymous defendant is one that i hope we would never , ever see again in our courts			2
' @entity15 , ( centre ) who is accused of targeting former prime minister @entity17 , faces retrial after a jury was discharged in the @entity16 's first part - secret terror trial			1
@entity15 was formerly known in the court case as @entity22 lord @entity0 said the press ' at the earliest possible stage ' should be entitled to make representations and see as much material as can be shown '			1
he added : ' i really passionately believe in open justice			0
justice that is not open , is not good justice			0
' there may be wholly exceptional reasons why you ca n't say very much more than what someone is charged with			0
' but i think anonymity and the nature of the charge , it is difficult to conceive of circumstances that could ever arise			0
' the lord chief justice said in cases where some secrecy was required - the reasoning must be explained openly and clearly			2
' you need to be very clear , if something is secret , why is it ? what 's the rationale ? one has to do that openly			0

lord @entity0 calls for clearer rules to prevent major trials in secret
wants to ' never , ever see again in our courts ' anonymous defendants
follows case of @entity15 , who was known as @entity22 in part - secret trial
