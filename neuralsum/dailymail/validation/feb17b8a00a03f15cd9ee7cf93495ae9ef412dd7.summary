these jaw - dropping holiday snaps taken by a group of daredevil tourists in @entity3 may be some of the most dangerous ever taken			1
the series of photos shows the friends taking turns as they stand on top of a boulder that is wedged between a mountain crevice in @entity3 , with a direct drop of nearly 800ft			1
the incredible experience provides impressive views for those who are brave enough to step foot on the boulder , but those who are afraid of heights would become weak at the knees and think better of it			2
it is situated more than 3,500ft above sea level and is a popular photo spot for thrill - seekers who are willing to risk their lives for a memorable holiday photo			1
despite the rain making its surface slippery the group of visitors in these photos ventured onto the boulder and posed with their arms in the air or a thumb extended as other tourists waited their turn			1
software developer @entity23 , 39 , took the photos while he was travelling with five friends to climb @entity26 , also known as @entity26			1
@entity27 – the official name for the boulder – is located on the edge of the @entity32 mountain in @entity33 , @entity3 he said : ‘ during our visit if was a rainy , and the boulder was actually a bit slippery			1
there 's a little path on the left side where you can jump onto the rock			0
‘ it 's hard to describe the feeling of standing on the boulder			2
after walking up the mountains your legs are a bit tired , and the idea of jumping onto , and balancing on , a slippery boulder hanging above a fjord seems like a really bad idea			0
‘ but , to be honest , it 's not hard getting out there , and it is well worth it			0
’ mr @entity23 , dressed in blue , can be seen posing on the boulder with his hands in the air and in one photo , taken from a distance , shows the stunning view and terrifying drop			2
despite the rain making its surface slippery the group of visitors in these photos ventured onto the boulder for some memorable snaps mr @entity23 , who lives just outside @entity95 , said the hike up to @entity27 is demanding as it involves three steep climbs			1
he added : ‘ most of the time you walk on smooth rock and boulders and because it was rainy and foggy it was a bit slippery			0
‘ there are metal chains along the steepest climbs of the trail			0
when we finally arrived at the boulder it was rather foggy but after a while it started to clear up and we were rewarded with a stunning view of the @entity111			0
‘ the whole experience was so breathtaking and just looking at the images now really takes me back there			0
‘ it 's not a place you go very often as it 's a bit remote , but it 's such an amazing piece of art from nature that it is definitely worth going			0
