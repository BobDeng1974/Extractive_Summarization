by @entity0 a quarter of the bumblebees in @entity3 are at risk of extinction as their habitats are destroyed , according to a new report			1
the loss of the bees will place farming in crisis because of the insects ’ vital role in pollinating crops , claim conservationists			2
sixteen of 68 bumblebee species in @entity3 are at risk , according to the @entity20 of the @entity21 ( @entity21 )			1
a quarter of the bumblebees , stock image pictured , in @entity3 are at risk of extinction as their habitats are destroyed , according to a new report			1
the loss of the bees will place farming in crisis because of the insects ' vital role in pollinating crops , claim conservationists bumblebees live in small nests of up to 200 bees and do not make honeycombs			1
bigger than honeybees , they usually have yellow and black stripes			0
half of @entity3 ’s bumblebee species have falling populations and just 13 per cent are increasing			2
some 26 of the listed 68 species live in @entity47 , of which 12 are decreasing , six stable and five increasing			1

the @entity21 , which brings together governments , scientists and conservation groups , said : ‘ of the five most important insect pollinators of @entity3 crops , three are bumblebee species			2
‘ together with other pollinators , bumblebees contribute more than £ 18billion ( € 22 billion euros ) to @entity3 agriculture a year , ’ its report said			2
the biggest threat to bumblebees is the destruction of wildflower meadows which gives them a food supply			1
the mass use of herbicides and pesticides has also been a big blow , with chemicals used to remove ‘ weeds ’ such as clover from farmlands that the insects feed on			0

the mass use of herbicides and pesticides has also been a big blow , with chemicals used to remove ' weeds ' such as clover from farmlands that the insects feed on the report , which is the first @entity20 assessment of the threats to bumblebees , said : ‘ climate change , the intensification of agriculture and changes in agricultural land are the main threats			0
the @entity99 ’s top environment official said the @entity99 ’s 28 nations were taking action to improve the situation			0
@entity99 environment commissioner @entity103 said : ‘ the @entity99 recently banned or restricted the use of certain pesticides that are dangerous to bees and is funding research into status of pollinators			0
‘ however , efforts clearly need to be scaled up			0
’ recent studies have found that diseases from commercial honeybee hives are spreading to bumblebees			0
a study in the journal @entity117 said that deformed wing virus , for instance , was found in both honeybees and bumblebees in @entity47			0
the virus was more prevalent in honeybees , suggesting it was spreading from them to bumblebees .			0

report finds a quarter of bumblebees in @entity3 are at risk of extinction
sixteen of 68 species are at risk because their habitats are being destroyed
the biggest threat to bumblebees is the destruction of wildflower meadows
in the @entity47 alone , 12 species are decreasing in number and six are stable
this has a *knock* *-* on effect for farming because the insects pollinate crops
