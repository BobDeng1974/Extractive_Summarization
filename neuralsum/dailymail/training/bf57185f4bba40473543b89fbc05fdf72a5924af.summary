among the reaction and criticism of @entity6 's latest @entity5 event , one feature that many experts agree on is that its upcoming @entity8 software is a game changer - in the way it looks and the way its new features will ' revitalise ' older models			1
current @entity5 and 4 owners , plus people with the @entity17 2 and @entity18 , can get the new software from 18 september , which means all devices released since 2010 will benefit from the release			0
the software has been in beta since @entity26 designer sir @entity25 unveiled its flatter look in june , and despite the visual changes being initially met with hostility , experts who have installed and used the operating system have been raving about it , with one classing it as ' incredible			0
' @entity6 's @entity8 software includes a new feature called airdrop that lets users share photos , video and contacts simply by clicking share and selecting a fellow @entity8 user from a contacts list @entity45 from @entity46 said : ' one of the best things about @entity6 's latest iphones is the slick new @entity8 software that runs the devices			1
' but that souped - up operating system could end up hurting sales because the free software upgrade will also work on @entity48 released since 2010 , giving owners of the older models less incentive to buy @entity6 's newest products			1
' he continues that even @entity6 's software boss , @entity59 predicts that anyone installing @entity8 will feel ' like they 're getting an all - new device			2
' @entity63 , head of mobile at media agency @entity66 @entity65 told @entity67 : ' i 've had @entity8 on my @entity5 5 for the last three months and have to say that it 's incredible - it is literally like getting a whole new device			2
' airdrop , quick access menu and the way photos are organised by location , event and time make for a brilliant new user experience			1
' the new @entity77 can be accessed from any screen in @entity8 , including the @entity79			0
it lets users quickly access settings , change their handset 's brightness level , control playback and access @entity87 individual apps can also be controlled and closed by double - clicking the ' home ' button and swiping up in @entity8 airdrop is a brand new feature to @entity5 that lets users share photos , video and contacts simply by clicking share and selecting a fellow @entity8 user from a contacts list			1
a similar feature is already available for @entity101 computers			2
all transfers are encrypted and items can be sent using @entity104 or @entity105			0
the quick access menu is called the @entity107 and it has been revamped to show the most relevant information			1
it shows new mail , missed calls and other notifications , but @entity113 7 additionally has a feature called today that gives an at - a - glance look at the day ahead			2
the menu can also now be opened while the screen is locked			2
it shows live weather and traffic information , for example , updated in real - time as well as birthdays or upcoming events			2
in addition to the @entity107 , @entity8 has a @entity125 that can be opened by swiping from the bottom of the screen and lets the user quickly access the @entity104 and network mode settings , change the screen 's brightness and play or stop music			1
the @entity125 looks similar to the @entity134 on the latest versions of @entity136			1
individual apps can also be controlled and closed by double - clicking the ' home ' button and swiping up in @entity8			2
@entity6 's updated photo feature has added years , collections , and @entity142 that groups images and videos together based on when and where they were taken			1
when taking shots , budding photographers can also now focus using the volume down key on the side of the handset , while the volume up button takes the picture			0
@entity6 's @entity59 , pictured , unveiled the @entity8 software in june			0
it has a flatter look and was designed by @entity26 sir @entity25 the new @entity159 streaming service , pictured will only be available to @entity161 phones when it launches			0
it lets users stream radio stations on and create playlists the @entity167 app , found in the @entity169 folder in @entity170 , now includes a spirit level			0
@entity6 has also added built - in a torch feature that uses the phone 's flash , removing the need to install torch apps			1
the firm has additionally made password manager apps redundant by introducing an encrypted folder that can automatically store multiple account logins and passwords			1
it can save credit card details using its @entity185 storage service , too			1
similar to how @entity187 works , the software can automatically fill forms with names , addresses and personal details to save time at the checkout , for example			1
because these passwords use @entity185 , the details can be synced across other @entity8 devices			1
additional new @entity8 features include a @entity199 , that asks for an @entity200 and a password before the feature can be disabled			0
this means if a phone is stolen , the thief ca n't stop the original owner from being able to locate it			0
it will also prevent people from deleting data from the handset			0
@entity6 has also added the @entity212 feature that personalise which apps appear when a user opens the @entity216 , based on the current location			1
not all the features of @entity8 will be available to older handsets because some require the @entity222 ' fingerprint scanner , for example , while others work best on the high - end model 's faster 64 - bit chip			0
the new @entity159 streaming service will only be available to @entity161 phones when it launches on the same day as @entity8			0
@entity6 's updated photo feature has added years , collections , and @entity142 that groups images and videos together based on when and where they were taken			1
each year holds collections and moments are shown in each collection it lets users stream radio stations on their @entity5 , @entity17 , or @entity239 and create playlists based on genres or artists			0
the service will work in a similar way to @entity246 's ' scrobbling ' feature that personalises radio stations based on past listening history			2
a @entity65 release date has not been confirmed , although it is likely to be dependent on agreements from record labels			0
speaking at wednesday 's launch @entity59 said : ' @entity8 is completely redesigned with an entirely new user interface and over 200 new features , so it â€™s like getting a brand new device , but one that will still be instantly familiar to our users			0
' he added that @entity6 has shipped 700 million @entity113 devices and 94 per cent of users are running the most recent software , @entity8 6 , with predictions that the majority will download the seventh - generation system when it launches next week .			0
