the @entity0 may be the mightiest military and economic power in the world but when it comes to shuttling its top diplomat around the globe , it 's beginning to look like a poor orphan			2
for the fourth time this year — and the second time in three months , secretary of state @entity9 was forced to fly home commercially when his aging @entity14 @entity13 757 , known in military parlance as a @entity16 , was grounded on thursday with a mechanical problem in @entity18			1
@entity9 , heading back to @entity19 from nuclear talks with senior @entity22 and @entity23 officials , made light of the situation , telling aides : ' if the hardest thing that happens in a given day is that you have to fly commercial , your life is pretty good			1
' takeoff : secretary of state @entity9 waves as he boards his plane to @entity18 - and on his return trip he was forced to fly commercial landing : @entity9 met wednesday in @entity18 with @entity23 foreign minister @entity34 to try and advance nuclear talks and meet the target date of november 24 embarrassing ? perhaps			1
@entity23 foreign minister @entity34 chuckled when he learned of @entity9 's predicament			1
' so it is not just our planes , ' @entity34 said			2
@entity23 has n't been able to refurbish its pre- 1979 fleet of @entity13 aircraft because of heavy @entity0 sanctions			0
but trivial ? not so much			0
officials say far more than appearance is at stake , particularly in the midst of multiple world crises like @entity49 , the military campaign against @entity51 militants , the crisis in @entity57 , @entity55 - @entity54 relations and , yes , the @entity23 nuclear talks			0
without access to the secure phone links and classified data on his own plane , @entity9 was effectively out of the loop during the nine - hour flight from @entity18 to @entity19			1
aides said he had to cancel or reschedule several calls with world leaders and other members of president @entity69 's national security team			0
' in the world we live in , we do high - stakes diplomacy via phone and secure phone , ' said @entity76 spokeswoman @entity75			2
' none of that is possible when any secretary of state is flying on a commercial plane without secure communications with hundreds of people			1
' ' every minute of their day is scheduled , ' she said			0
' there is not a single flight where secretary @entity9 is n't calling in via secure phone to an interagency meeting or receiving sensitive national security information , or reading classified information or briefings			1
' and he flies a lot			0
frequent flier : before his current trip , @entity9 had logged more than 566,000 plane miles this year alone , according to the @entity76 greetings : at the airport @entity9 spoke with @entity98 foreign minister @entity97 before his current trip , @entity9 had logged more than 566,000 plane miles this year alone , according to the @entity76			1
that 's nearly 1,220 hours or more than 50 days in the air			0
problems with the 1990s - era @entity14 fleet that ferry @entity0 's top officials are n't new , and secretaries of state have long complained about the aircraft they must fly for official business			1
some have joked about being envious of colleagues with newer , more efficient and more luxurious planes			0
secretary of state @entity111 encountered several aviation breakdowns when she was in office , including a tire that burst on landing in the @entity115 , leading to an unscheduled overnight stay in @entity116			2
but she never had to resort to flying commercially			2
yet the problems seem to be becoming more frequent and more serious			0
thursday 's incident was the fourth with one of @entity9 's planes this year			1
the previous two — in @entity122 in january and in @entity123 in march — were resolved with only minor delays to his schedule			2
but in august , an electronics issue forced @entity9 to return to @entity19 from @entity127 on a commercial flight at the end of a round - the - world diplomatic mission			1
on thursday , the crew discovered that an auxiliary fuel tank was leaking			0
an @entity134 reporter who visited the aircraft found the cabin full of fumes			0
