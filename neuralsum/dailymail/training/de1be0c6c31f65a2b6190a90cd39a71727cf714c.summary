published : 15:57 est , 10 february 2014 @entity1 : 16:20 est , 10 february 2014 a @entity3 entertainment anchor confused @entity4 with @entity5 on live tv , making for an incredibly awkward interview			1
on @entity9 this morning , @entity8 asked @entity4 , who was appearing on the show from @entity11 to discuss his new movie ' @entity12 , ' about his recent @entity15 commercial			1
but the @entity17 actor did n't do a @entity15 spot this year - @entity5 did - and @entity4 , understandably , goes off the handle			1
all the while , @entity8 , who boasts on the @entity9 website of being the entertainment reporter for the no. 1 morning show in @entity29 , scrambles , desperately trying to apologize and jokingly shrug off his offensive blunder , but @entity4 wo n't let him			1
he genuinely seems like he ca n't believe what 's going on			0
@entity15 : actor @entity5 starred in a @entity35 - inspired @entity15 commercial this month the mess begins right at the start of the chat , when @entity8 asks , ' did you get a lot of reaction to that @entity15 commercial ? ' @entity4 looks confused and responds ' what @entity15 commercial ? ' the penny immediately drops , and there 's a painful silence as a ghost white @entity8 stars off screen , probably at a producer , in a desperate plea for help			1
but @entity4 gets it almost as quickly			0
pointing his finger angrily , he says , ' you see , you 're as crazy as the people on @entity58			0
i 'm not @entity5 ! ' @entity8 chuckles uncomfortably , repeating , ' that 's my fault , i know that , my mistake , ' as he holds his hands up in surrender			2
but @entity4 continues : ' we do n't all look alike ! we may all be black and famous but we do n't all look alike			2
' as @entity8 continues to backpedal , @entity4 asks , baffled : ' you 're the entertainment reporter ? ' you 're the entertainment reporter for this station and you do n't know the difference between me and @entity5 ? ' he then quips , ' there must be a very short line for your job			1
' still in disbelief , he exclaims ' really ? really ? ' before lightening the mood slightly by joking about the various ads he , @entity5 and even @entity75 have starred in , to clarify to the less than qualified entertainment reporter just which ' black guy ' he is			0
awkward : @entity8 , left , stairs off screen as he realizes his offensive mistake angry : @entity4 , right , then points his finger angrily at the reporter and says ' you see , you 're as crazy as the people on @entity58			2
i 'm not @entity5 ! ' @entity8 joined the @entity86 in 1991 , according to the station 's network			2
in that time he 's ' established a reputation as someone who goes beyond the entertainment headlines of the day			0
his insights and exploration of the deeper meaning and impact of the stories within the entertainment industry generate conversation within the business , as well as outside it			0
' perhaps in this case , the conversation he 's generating is not the conversation he 's after ? @entity9 and @entity8 have not yet responded to @entity102 's request for comment .			0

on @entity9 this morning , anchor @entity8 asked @entity4 , who was appearing on the show from @entity11 to discuss his new movie ' *robocop* ' , about his recent @entity15 commercial
but the actor did n't do a @entity15 spot this year - @entity5 did
livid , @entity4 suggested @entity8 was being racist , shouting , ' we do n't all look alike ' , referring to black actors
all the while , @entity8 scrambles , desperately trying to apologize and jokingly shrug off his offensive blunder
