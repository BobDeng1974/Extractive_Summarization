by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 03:43 est , 25 september 2013 updated : 12:41 est , 25 september 2013 an eight - year - old @entity3 boy showed he intends to live life in the fast lane after deciding to head out on one of the busiest motorways in @entity1 ... on his tricycle			1
the unnamed youngster was filmed careering down the @entity11 expressway which runs through downtown @entity1 , on his three - wheeler			1
. as the boy speeds down the slope of the two - lane carriageway into @entity15 with his legs splayed out either side of the trike cars zoom past him on the outside lane			1
@entity20 : dicing with death : fearless boy punches the air as he rides alongside cars freewheeling : the boy , said to be from a local slum , kicked his legs out and sped down the hill of the busy motorway in the incredible clip , filmed on friday , the youngster starts off at the top of a slope and gathers speed by pushing off with his left leg then jumping on the tricycle			1
the stunt looks like it could go disastrously wrong for a moment when the toy - rider wobbles precariously around for a few seconds as he tries to gain control			1
luckily , the road is unusually quiet as he gains composure and the fearless boy even takes the time to remove his right shoe before it falls off			1
as he veers precariously into the @entity47 , several cars come around the bend			1
risky : the @entity11 expressway is one of the busiest roads in @entity1 toy rider : the boy seems completely unfazed as he sets off on his death defying ride totally unfazed , the boy looks around at the stunned driver he is sharing the road with			1
he even pretends to change gears by twisting the handlebars and hunches over as if revving his make - believe engine			0
despite being one bump in the road away from certain peril , the fearless junior even has the audacity to give the alarmed motorists a thumbs up before grabbing the handlebars again			0
hard shoulder : at one point the boy is almost forced onto the central wall of the busy highway pit stop : the junior joy rider stops close to the edge of the lane before rejoining the road for a second time during his dangerous venture onto the carriageway , no driver stops to help the boy who is on a notoriously busy stretch of road			2
the bypass is also riddled with security cameras operated by @entity1 city council , but they were oblivious to the incident until a local tv station showed them the footage			1
as the boy reaches this the end of his ride he lifts his arms in celebration as if having triumphed in a grand prix , but his moment of glory is abruptly brought to an end by a motorist who blasts their horn at the pint sized daredevil			2
rider in red : the boy is said to be known to authorities in @entity1 as a local trouble causer final lap : he eventually calls it a day after being narrowly missed by a number of speeding cars not satisfied with the one lap , to the astonishment of surrounding drivers , the youngster then drags his bike from the hard shoulder and gets back into the inside lane for another go			1
this time he hugs the side of the road and that may have saved his life as a grey car speeds round the bend , just yards behind the boy			2
fortunately , the driver spots the tricycle up ahead and swerves into the outside lane to avoid a collision			2
no fear : the boy insisted he was not scared when reporters caught up with him after his stunt a local tv reporter who filmed the escapade gave the boy a post race interview when they found him a few minutes later sitting on his trusty tricycle			1
' were n’t you scared ? ' asks the reporter			0
' no ' says the child with a complete air of innocence			0
although they were not shown in the video , the boy was accompanied by two older brothers who had also participated in the dangerous motorway game			2
a reporter tracked down the family of five to a nearby run down property			0
the mother , father and three children were said by neighbours to be living in a one bedroom space			0
the premises which has home walls inside , dividing the area up into separate dwellings , houses a total of twenty families			0
it ’s situated close to the motorway and opposite the @entity176 building in the centre			0
each family pays 300 reais , around £ 83.00 , in rent per month			0
on friday afternoon , journalists found the mother but she declined to comment			0
by yesterday , the family had disappeared as the authorities , who had been alerted to the incident , turned up to take the children into care			0
@entity1 city council revealed the brood was already known to social services and the children had been taken into care before following previous concerns raised about their welfare			1
the city 's municipal guards , who are responsible for road safety , issued a statement this week apologising for their failure to respond appropriately to the incident on friday			2
they said : ' nobody reported the incident to us , so we were unaware of what was happening			0
if we had known we would have closed the road down immediately to ensure the safety of the public and the child ' .			0
