a woman who was battered for refusing a thug 's sexual advances took justice into her own hands and forced him to stand by a roadside with a sign reading : ' i beat women			1
honk if i 'm a scumbag			0
' @entity10 , 20 , from @entity11 , @entity12 , persuaded @entity13 to undergo the humiliating ordeal - during which he also wore a dunce 's hat - in return for her dropping charges against him			1
' i think it will teach him a lesson , ' she told @entity25			0
' i think he 'll think twice about doing it again			0
when he started groping her she hit him and he responded by beating her up so bad she got a concussion @entity10 had never met @entity13 before last saturday night , when he was invited to join a group of her friends for a night out clubbing			1
by the end of the night , @entity10 and @entity13 sat next to each other in the back seat of a car and he started groping her			1
the obvious choice : @entity13 avoided legal ramifications by going alone with @entity10 's punishment @entity44 told him to stop , but he did n't listen so she hit him in defense			1
' i did hit him first and then all of a sudden that 's when he started beating me repeatedly , punching me until i had a broken nose and concussion , ' @entity10 told @entity50			1
a picture taken after the beating shows blood running out of her nose , with red marks all over her face			0
the following morning , @entity10 filed a report with the @entity11 police who recorded her side of the story and took her to the hospital for treatment			2
' we responded to her home			0
she did have visible injuries			0
the officer initiated a report for battery , and rescue personnel transported her to a local hospital , ' @entity68 spokeswoman @entity67 told @entity74			0
but @entity10 's legal case against @entity13 stopped when she read a remorseful message written on his @entity78 page			1
' @entity79 ( sic ) was a wake - up call			0
i seriously need change , ' @entity13 wrote			2
@entity10 challenged that statement by crafting up an alternate punishment for @entity85			0
if he sat outside at a busy intersection for eight hours holding up a sign that says ' i beat women ' she would n't press charges			1
avoiding legal ramifications , @entity13 took her up on that offer			0
in addition to holding up a sign that read ' i beat women			1
honk if i 'm a scumbag ' @entity13 also wore a dunce cap			1
sorry : the morning after the incident , @entity10 found this remorseful message written on @entity85 's @entity78 page citizen justice : @entity13 sat at the @entity12 intersection for eight hours holding a sign which read ' i beat women			1
honk if i 'm a scumbag '			0
he also wore a dunce cap			2
@entity10 was nice and seems to have let him pass the time playing on his cell phone @entity10 thinks this punishment was more appropriate to @entity85 's crime , and says she did n't want him to go to jail for a year			2
while @entity10 thinks she got justice for the beating , women 's advocates and local police do n't agree			2
@entity115 , an advocate for battered women said the punishment trivializes a serious issue			0
@entity11 police say @entity10 should n't have taken the law into her own hands			0
they have tried several times to get in contact with @entity10 , but she has not returned any of the calls - per her agreement with @entity85			2
trivialized : local police and an abused women 's activist believe @entity10 should n't have taken the law into her own hands out of trouble : police have tried to get in contact with @entity10 to continue the legal process but she has not responded to their calls - holding up her end of the deal with @entity13			1

@entity13 started groping 20 - year - old @entity10 after a night out clubbing
@entity10 told @entity13 to stop and when he refused she hit him
@entity13 responded by beating her so hard , she got a concussion
@entity10 *planned* on pressing charges against @entity13 but changed her mind after reading a remorseful message written on his @entity78 page
instead , @entity13 sat at a busy intersection for eight hours holding a sign that read ' i beat women ' while *wearing* a dunce cap
