the @entity0 has insisted that the creation of its ' @entity3 ' programme was not a covert operation			1
the @entity6 administration defended the communications network called @entity3 , which drew 40,000 users in @entity9 in two years , saying the programme was ' invested and debated ' in @entity11			1
but two senior democrats on congressional and judiciary committees said they knew nothing about the effort , with one of them describing it as ' dumb , dumb , dumb			1
but the users were neither aware it was created by an @entity33 agency with ties to the @entity35 , nor that @entity33 contractors were gathering personal data about them for political purposes			2
chairman of the @entity40 and @entity41 , senator @entity42 said he had no knowledge of the social media network			2
and he called the project ' dumb , dumb , dumb ' during an appearance on @entity47 yesterday			2
senator @entity48 , left , said the project was ' dumb , dumb , dumb '			1
@entity3 ended abruptly in @entity9 in 2012 he added : ' i know they said we were			1
we were notified in the most oblique way that nobody could understand it			2
' i 'm going to ask two basic questions : why were n't we specifically told about this if you 're asking us for money ? and secondly , whose bright idea was this anyway ? ' congressman @entity63 of @entity64 , the top @entity65 on the @entity66 , said he too was unaware of @entity3			1
it is unclear whether the @entity3 scheme was legal under @entity33 law , which requires written authorization of covert action by the president as well as congressional notification			1
@entity3 was partly funded by the @entity74 and was said to be aimed at young @entity9 @entity0 spokesman @entity75 said he was not aware of individuals in the @entity0 who had known about the programme			1
but hours later the narrative had shifted to say that the administration had offered to discuss funding for it with the congressional committees that approve federal programs and budgets			2
@entity35 spokeswoman @entity85 described the @entity3 scheme as ' discreet ' but in no way classified or covert			1
she added that the project did not rise to the level that required the either the current or former secretary of state , to be informed			0
in his prior position as chairman of the @entity94 , secretary of state @entity91 had asked congressional investigators to examine whether or not @entity33 democracy promotion programs in @entity9 were operated according to @entity33 laws , among other issues			0
@entity3 , which is slang for a @entity9 hummingbird 's tweet was launched in the country in 2009 the resulting report , released by the @entity103 in january 2013 , does not examine whether or not the programs were covert			1
it does not say that any @entity33 laws were broken			0
the @entity103 report does not specifically refer to @entity3 , but does note that @entity24 programs included ' support for the development of independent social networking platforms			1
' but the @entity113 chairman of a @entity0 oversight subcommittee said his panel will be looking into the project too			0
' that is not what @entity24 should be doing , " said congressman @entity117			0
' @entity24 is flying the @entity33 flag and should be recognized around the globe as an honest broker of doing good			0
if they start participating in covert , subversive activities , the credibility of the @entity33 is diminished			0
' it is said that the @entity22 for @entity23 , pictured , went to extensive lengths to conceal @entity129 's ties to the project in a statement , @entity131 , director of @entity33 affairs at @entity9 's @entity134 , also criticised the latest revelations			0
he said ' this shows once again that the @entity33 government has not renounced its plans of subversion against @entity9 , which have as their aim the creation of situations of destabilization in our country to create changes in the public order and toward which it continues to devote multimillion - dollar budgets each year			0
' the government of the @entity33 must respect international law and the goals and principles of the @entity155 charter and , therefore , cease its illegal and clandestine actions against @entity9 , which are rejected by the @entity9 people and international public opinion			0
' but several other lawmakers voiced their support for @entity3 , which is slang for a @entity9 hummingbird 's tweet			1
but chairman of the @entity94 , said @entity24 should be applauded for giving people in @entity9 a less - controlled platform to talk to each other senator @entity167 , chairman of the @entity94 , said @entity24 should be applauded for giving people in @entity9 a less - controlled platform to talk to each other			2
mr @entity167 added : ' the whole purpose of our democracy programs , whether it be in @entity9 or other parts of the world , is in part to create a free flow of information in closed societies			0
' @entity24 and its contractors went to extensive lengths to conceal @entity129 's ties to the project , according to interviews and documents obtained by the @entity185 they set up front companies in @entity188 and the @entity189 to hide the money trail , and recruited @entity191 without telling them they would be working on a @entity33 taxpayer - funded project			0
the estimated $ 1.6 million spent on @entity3 was publicly earmarked for an unspecified project in @entity194 , public government data show , but those documents do n't reveal where the funds were actually spent , according to @entity185 @entity3 was launched in 2009 , shortly after the arrest of @entity199 , left			1
@entity9 @entity200 , right described the abrupt end of the network as ' like a vacuum			0
' @entity3 was publicly launched shortly after the 2009 arrest in @entity9 of @entity33 contractor @entity199			1
he was imprisoned after travelling repeatedly to the country on a separate , clandestine @entity24 mission to expand internet access using sensitive technology that only governments use			0
@entity24 told the @entity185 that @entity3 stopped in september 2012 when a government grant ended			2
' the moment when @entity3 disappeared , ( it ) was like a vacuum , " said @entity200 , a @entity9 user who never suspected his beloved network had ties to @entity129			1
' in the end , we never learned what happened			0
we never learned where it came from			0

@entity222 say @entity3 was ' invested and debated ' in @entity11
but two senior democrats say they knew nothing about the plan
senator @entity48 said ' whose bright idea was this anyway ? '
@entity231 gained more 40,000 users in 2 years before it abruptly disappeared
