the @entity0 , the @entity1 and @entity2 on @entity3 are side - stepping questions about @entity5 as the controversy over her cyber hygiene escalates			1
while some of the presumed presidential candidate 's party members have come to her defense , many lawmakers headed for the exits this week as reporters asked them for their opinion on the way @entity17 handled her email while at the @entity1			1
@entity21 strategists were more willing discuss the scandal - but what they had to say , @entity17 probably wo n't like			1
@entity2 are running for cover this week as former secretary of state @entity5 takes fire from the press for over her cyber hygiene			0
officials at 1600 @entity28 now claim they did n't know that @entity17 was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business officials at 1600 @entity28 now claim they did n't know that @entity17 was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business until @entity33 reopened an investigation into the @entity36 attack			1
according to the @entity38 , it was the @entity0 counsel 's office that ordered the @entity1 to retrieve @entity17 's old emails			1
that version of events was never relayed to the press at large , despite the fact that president @entity46 's spokesman @entity45 spent the better part of his briefings with reporters on tuesday and wednesday answering questions about what the @entity0 knew about @entity17 's exclusive use of her personal email address , when it knew it , and a host of other related inquires			1
he deflected as often as possible and referred press to the @entity1 and @entity17			1
@entity45 did note that @entity17 's detractors and government watchdogs have n't provided ' any evidence ' that would indicate that the former administration official and her team are ' not being forthright ' about turning in copies of all of her email communications from her four years in the president 's cabinet			1
his comments were hardly a ringing endorsement of @entity17 's honesty , however			1
the @entity0 got a break on thursday when a snowstorm bore down on @entity75 , giving @entity76 cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps			2
a large - scale , public q and a session is n't likely to make friday 's schedule , either , as the president is travelling to @entity85 for an event at @entity87			2
usually a spokesperson for the president holds a small gaggle with press riding @entity91 on those days			0
unwilling or unable to say who in at the @entity1 was responsible for making sure @entity17 fully complied with the demand , the deputy spokesman there , @entity92 , directed journalists to the former secretary of state			1
pressed to declare that she was ' confident ' that all of @entity17 's pertinent emails were now in the possession of the federal government she said , ' what i ’m saying is her staff has stated that anything related to her work has been given to the @entity1			1
' ' but this is obviously a confirmation her staff has to make , ' she added , after a reporter asked if she has any ' reason to doubt ' the veracity of @entity17 's claims			1
she said she did not			0
former @entity46 adviser @entity114 said wednesday night that he thinks the @entity17 is adding to her woes by keeping silent			1
' it would be good to get out there and answer these questions			0
' @entity17 is pictured here in 2008 taking questions from the press during the @entity122 a few months before she was sworn in as secretary of state @entity17 's former colleagues in @entity33 were wo n't to discuss the issue at all			1
' can we talk about it later ? i have to go to my vote , ' @entity17 's successor in the @entity130 , @entity129 of @entity131 , told the @entity134			1
the news publication said @entity137 sen. @entity136 , normally outspoken , excused herself for the same reason			0
' i do n't know enough about it to appropriately respond , ' @entity140 sen. @entity139 said			2
congressional democrats were equally reticent to comment to @entity143			0
' i 'm not up to speed on it			0
i 'm really not , ' @entity147 sen. @entity146 told the network on wednesday - more than a day after story broke			2
' check back , ' @entity146 , the chair of @entity2 ' campaign arm , said			0
@entity152 sen. @entity151 also asked for a mulligan			0
' i do n't know enough about what those rules are , honestly , to comment , ' she claimed			2
and the list goes on			0
@entity158 sen. @entity157 told @entity134 he does n't ' know the facts ' but ' it sounds like somebody made a mistake			2
' ' she 's going to have to give an answer to it , ' @entity163 rep. @entity162 told @entity143			2
@entity168 rep. @entity167 , the ranking member on the @entity0 's @entity169 on @entity36 , said it 's not his job to protect @entity17 , his party 's possible nominee for president			1
' i want to be clear , i am not trying to defend @entity5 , ' he said			0
' i am trying to defend the truth … we have some things we are going to try and figure out			0
' if @entity17 ca n't make the email story go away quick enough , she could go from presidential front runner in 2016 to persona non-grata			1
supporters of @entity183 are shown here in 2008 after she lost that year 's nomination to @entity46 retiring @entity187 sen. @entity186 was one of the few @entity21 senators to stand by @entity17			1
' that 's a nothing burger			2
@entity192 , ' she told @entity134			0
' there is n't one secretary of state that ever did that because the law did n't change until after she left , so they 're making a mountain out of a molehill , ' she added			0
likewise , @entity201 sen. @entity200 said he 'd ' be surprised if a number of secretaries of @entity1 had n't done that for as long as we 've had email			1
' ' that 's all i 'm going to say , ' he added			0
@entity131 rep. @entity208 blamed @entity209 for the mess and accused them of ' trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal			1
' ' that 's what they do here , ' he told @entity143			0
' pretty soon we 'll have a special investigative committee for every action that @entity5 takes			0
there will be a special select committee on her breakfast , her lunch and her dinner and what she had in between			0
just add this to the list			0
' it is true that @entity17 's predecessors also used their personal email addresses to conduct official business			1
but other secretaries of state did not create private email addresses the day before their confirmation votes for the explicit purpose of communicating with their future staff			0
nor did they house their email addresses on a privately owned server that is inaccessible to the government and can be wiped clean at their leisure			2
they were n't actively considering a bid for president , either			0
reporters showered @entity0 press secretary @entity45 with questions on wednesday about the @entity17 email controversy			1
the @entity0 got a break on thursday when a snowstorm bore down on @entity75 , giving @entity76 cause to cancel his daily meeting with the press corps former @entity46 adviser @entity114 said wednesday night that he thinks the @entity17 is adding to her woes by keeping silent			1
' it would be good to get out there and answer these questions , ' @entity114 said on @entity262 's @entity261 with @entity263 , according to @entity264			2
' why did she used a separate email ? how did she secure that email ? was there another email through which she communicated with people ? ' he asked			0
' by not answering these questions , they are allowing this story to fester in ways that are unhelpful			0
so lack of speed kills in this case , ' the former @entity0 official said			2
the @entity1 has said that @entity17 had just one email address during her tenure there - the account in question			1
and @entity17 , first through a spokesman , and then through @entity286 has touched on the issue			2
she has not explained why she did what she did , though , or responded to any of the other questions @entity114 - and the media - put forward			2
a @entity21 strategist who spoke to @entity264 warned that if @entity17 ca n't make the story go away quick enough , she could go from presidential front runner to persona non-grata			1
' we ’re probably a month or so away [ from the campaign launch ] and if this is not handled really well within the next three to six weeks , you ’re going to see chatter among @entity21 operatives saying , " maybe we need another person in this race			1
" and that is really problematic			0
' ' when you do stuff like this , man , you just raise a lot of concerns and red flags , ' @entity264 's source said			0
' it ’s kinda weird			0

@entity0 now claims it did n't know @entity17 was solely using her personal email address to conduct government business
@entity1 would n't say it was ' confident ' that @entity17 had turned over all her emails from her tenure there
@entity17 's former @entity21 colleagues in @entity33 were wo n't to discuss the issue at all
@entity131 rep. @entity208 blamed @entity209 for the mess and accused them of ' trying to manufacture or amplify crisis or scandal , ' however
former @entity46 adviser @entity114 said wednesday night that he thinks the @entity17 is adding to her woes by keeping silent
' if this is not handled really well , ' a @entity21 strategist said , @entity21 operatives will begin saying , ' " maybe we need another person in this race " '
