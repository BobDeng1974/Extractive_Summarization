' talking about her memoir there 's something i 've been dying to tell you , which was released less than a fortnight ago , @entity0 said : ' this book is for everyone , if one person who feels on their own - you do feel alone - and it 's very hard to take onboard , obviously it 's taken us a year to absorb it			1

you know when you get so cynical in life - they say yet again you 're not right for this part			0
' you learn so much and the biggest thing - as you know i 'm not very confrontational , i 'm a bit of a weed , of course i 've become a bit grumpy - it 's amazing to be able to say things to people			2
it 's taken me 66 years to find any dignity			2
' @entity0 said she had never taken the view that her illness was ' not fair '			0
' to be honest we have no right to live forever			0
you know how i love a survey - a survey says you can live until you 're 80 , yes lovely , but it 's not a given			2
somebody else decides when you pop off the twig , ' she said			0
