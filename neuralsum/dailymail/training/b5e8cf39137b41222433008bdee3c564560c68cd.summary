' after the door was opened , the two had a chat close to the door frame , ' @entity90 told court			1

' @entity17 then fell out of camera range			0
' then i heard two muffled bangs			1

' an autopsy could not determine definitively how @entity17 died , though a pathologist has testified it was likely by ' mechanical asphyxiation , ' with compression applied to her neck			0
male dna from swabs of a substance lifted from @entity17 's breasts was matched — to a degree of probability estimated to be 1 in 25 trillion — to @entity14			1
@entity246 found on @entity17 's groin area matched @entity14 to a probability of 1 in 2.7 quintillion , and dna from a small blood stain on a blue t - shirt seized from @entity253 's first - floor apartment matched @entity17 to a probably of 1 in 140 quadrillion .			1

@entity14 , 32 , was found guilty of the first - degree murder of @entity8 student @entity17 in court today in @entity10
@entity17 , 23 , was *sexually* assaulted and then murdered *inside* her apartment as her boyfriend , @entity258 watched helplessly from @entity13
the tragic student was found dead on the *morning* of april *15* , 2011
@entity90 , who was in @entity13 , says that the killer *allegedly* knocked on the door and tried to hug @entity17 who tried to force him out
@entity90 says he then heard what sounded like two muffled bangs and that a man ' naked from the waist down ' shut off the lights , *locked* the door and turned off the webcam
the chances that the semen found on victim @entity17 were n't from @entity14 are calculated as one in 2.7 quintillion
prosecutors said @entity14 was known to trawl online chat rooms for @entity283 women
