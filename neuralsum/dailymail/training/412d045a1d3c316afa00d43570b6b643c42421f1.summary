by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 and @entity2 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell @entity3 could be asked to replace @entity4 as an @entity7 @entity6 pundit if the @entity8 quits for a job at @entity10			1
@entity11 captain @entity3 , who retired from international football in 2012 , has been installed by bookmakers as the favourite to replace @entity4			1
neither camp would confirm any approach but the possibility of @entity3 working at the @entity6 is intriguing			2
@entity18 bound ? @entity3 could be heading to the @entity6 as a pundit with @entity7 on opposite sides : if @entity7 do sign @entity3 up then it would put him up against @entity23 's @entity22 for starters , it would pitch him head - to - head against former @entity27 team - mate @entity22 , who is among the @entity23 pundits			1
the pair fell out after @entity3 was charged with racially abusing @entity31 ’s brother @entity30 during a game against @entity33 and although he was cleared in court he was banned by the @entity35			0
as a former @entity27 captain , @entity3 has a chequered history with the @entity6			2
he lead a failed mutiny against @entity40 ’s methods at the @entity41 in @entity42			0
popular : @entity4 has earned rave reviews for his honest approach during @entity7 's coverage meanwhile , @entity4 is expected to be named as @entity47 ’s no 2 at @entity10 once he returns from two @entity49 friendlies in the @entity50 next week			1
@entity4 ’s decision to pull out of his role as an @entity7 pundit means he has more time to invest in a return to @entity56 football			1
@entity47 has been on the lookout for a new assistant since @entity59 was suspended in april			0
persuading @entity4 to join him would be a coup			0
it had appeared @entity62 would appoint the 42 - year - old as their manager but it is understood a lack of transfer funds and the probable loss of @entity27 goalkeeper @entity68 swayed @entity4 ’s mind			0
@entity47 , 44 , has been in discussions with @entity4 for a number of days , and both men share a deep loyalty to the methods of @entity75			0
@entity4 would be able to remain @entity49 assistant if he took up the role on offer at @entity10 .			2

@entity11 skipper could be offered role as @entity7 @entity6 pundit
@entity4 pulled out of @entity7 's coverage to focus on *coaching*
@entity3 quit international football in 2012
if @entity3 takes role with @entity7 then he will be up against @entity22 on the @entity23
