by @entity1 reporter published : 12:27 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 14:05 est , 23 november 2012 if a weekend in @entity4 is n’t wild enough for @entity5 , a @entity3 entrepreneur is about to add five more hours of party to either end			1
@entity8 is one step closer to bringing to life the @entity8 , a luxurious ' party train ' complete with big screen tvs , recliners and two ultra lounges after striking an agreement with @entity16 last week			1
' the whole idea is when you get on a train , you feel like you ’re in @entity4 , ' said @entity20 , president and ceo of the $ 100 million venture that hopes to launch its maiden voyage on @entity24 2013			1
' it ’s essentially a nightclub on wheels			1
to keep ticket prices low , the company would try to make money booking @entity4 hotels and entertainment for passengers			2
it would start in @entity58 , @entity59 — already home to an @entity62 station and part of @entity66 ’s @entity65 commuter train network — and end in downtown @entity4			2
tourists ca n’t get from @entity66 to @entity4 by rail alone , and @entity20 ’s company is n’t the first to try and fix that			2
the much - talked - about @entity72 project proposes a high - speed train connecting @entity4 to the region from which it draws 25 percent of its tourists			2
all ease : the president and ceo of the $ 100 million venture says his plan sympathizes with people who spend up to 40 hours gambling in @entity4 and then drive seven hours back to @entity66 all aboard ! @entity16 gave a go ahead for the @entity8 ' party train last week , seen here but it ’s a multi-billion - dollar proposal that would require setting new tracks , and it ’s often panned as a ' train to nowhere ' because the first phase would start in relatively obscure @entity89 , about 100 miles outside of @entity35			1
the @entity8 proposal calls for an @entity62 crew aboard a 576 - passenger train that runs at standard speeds on traditional tracks			1
a conditional agreement with @entity16 , approved nov. 16 , will allow the company to use a rail line that ’s currently limited to freight trains and has n’t served passengers since @entity62 discontinued its @entity101 service in 1997 due to low ridership			2
with initial plans for one trip a day on thursday , friday , sunday , and monday , @entity20 believes he can attract tourists weary of the weekend traffic gridlock and perhaps hung over from their weekend revelry			2
what 's included : riders would be given a meal and beverage with their $ 99 ticket with plenty more drinks available for purchase , a sports bar 's sketch seen here ' sunday is horrific , ' @entity20 said of the @entity118 corridor that links @entity4 and its neighbor			1
' so now you ’ve been up for 40 hours gambling and you have to drive for seven hours — that ’s just horrible			0
but people do it in spite of that ! ' @entity126 , who was in @entity4 from @entity127 for a few days over @entity128 , said he ’d like the option of hopping on a train rather than braving bumper - to - bumper traffic on the way back			0
' if you party really hard , it sucks driving back , ' said @entity126 , 28			0
vegas visitor @entity135 , 25 , said she ’d have to weigh the cost of the train ride against other cheap options , including discounted flights and sharing the expense of driving to @entity4			1
' for special occasions it would be good , but not all the time , ' she said			0
amenities : a possibly more quiet room is seen aboard the train which will take riders on a five - hour trip each way @entity149 , a transportation consultant for the @entity150 , pointed to the proposed trains and other alternatives to personal cars as options that could entice a new generation of tourists			0
a new @entity158 nonstop bus route between @entity35 and @entity4 launched earlier this month			0
' these modes of transportation do appeal to a younger , more eco-friendly traveler , ' @entity149 said			0
' this generation is more interested in passenger rail , transit and high - speed rail than previous generations			0
' there ’s still work to be done on the @entity8 to get it running by late 2013			1
the sixteen cars the company has purchased need to be renovated , and a station needs to be completed in @entity172			0
' we ’re four years and $ 12 million into it			1
it ’s a lot of infrastructure building , ' @entity20 said			0
' this is a simple concept in discussion , but it ’s complicated to do			0

@entity8 would cost $ 99 each way and include a meal and beverage
*additional* alcoholic drinks would be available for purchase
