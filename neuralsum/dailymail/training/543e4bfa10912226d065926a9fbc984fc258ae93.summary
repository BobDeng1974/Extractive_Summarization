by @entity0 @entity1 faces an anxious wait on sunday to find out if he will be denied automatic @entity4 selection by @entity6 ’s late charge in the final round of the @entity8			1
@entity6 carded a 69 on saturday to finish his third round on 10 under par , four shots off the second place he needs to beat @entity1 to the last guaranteed spot in @entity15 ’s team			1
the 39 - year - old @entity16 began the tournament in 10th place in the @entity15 standings but has shown remarkable resilience to battle back from a disappointing opening round			1
anxious : @entity1 will have to wait until sunday evening to see if he has an automatic @entity4 spot chasing : scot @entity6 is one round away in @entity24 from displacing @entity1 but needs a top - two finish if he can overhaul fellow @entity16 @entity27 , who shot a brilliant 66 yesterday to finish on 14 - under , or even beat overnight leader @entity28 on 16 - under , @entity15 captain @entity26 will have to choose three wildcards from four of his heavyweights : @entity1 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33			1
‘ i would hate to be the person to deny him a place on the @entity4 but i know if it comes down to it , he plays to win and that ’s the same attitude i have to have , ’ said @entity27 , who holed from 40 feet for birdie on the 18th to complete a flawless 66			1
‘ @entity40 is a fantastic player , as he has shown to get into contention			2
he will perform on sunday and i wish him the best in getting ( the @entity4 place ) but i have to accomplish my job of getting into the mix and picking up win number three			1
’ tough : @entity27 admits he would hate to be the man to deny @entity48 a place at @entity50 friends : @entity6 and @entity27 know each other well and both practise at @entity54 quite often @entity26 and @entity56 captain @entity55 will name their three wild cards on tuesday , and it is widely assumed the @entity59 would prefer the experience of @entity1 , who holed the winning putt at @entity62 in 2010 , over the untried @entity16			1
‘ @entity26 ’s going to have a tough decision to make , ’ said @entity63 this week at the @entity64			2
‘ there ’s a few guys that in previous years would have been able to make the team on merit and have n’t			2
do you go with experience or with form ? ’ however , @entity6 , who lives just 35 miles from @entity50 , where the tournament gets underway on september 26 , knows the course and two - time @entity4 player and former open champion @entity77 believes his compatriot should still make the team even if he fails to secure a top two finish in @entity24 on sunday			1
choices : @entity56 captain @entity55 and @entity15 counterpart @entity26 will name wild cards on tuesday ‘ if @entity48 gets in , he ’ll just have the best week of his life , ’ @entity77 said			1
‘ it ’s the best tournament there is in golf , there ’s no question about that			2
‘ @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity6 would be the three that people are talking about			0
i ’m not sure the course suits @entity33 all that much but , again , he ’s hugely experienced			0
he ’s been a world no 1 , it would be harsh to leave him out			0
for me , i think the course sets up better for a @entity6 than it does for a @entity33			0
’ @entity6 , the nephew of three - time @entity4 captain @entity98 , carded four birdies and a bogey in a solid three under - par round yesterday that leaves him well - placed for a final day charge			1
he said : ‘ it ’s all to play for			0
you never know what happens in this game and guys have won from further back than this			0
i ’ll just go out and try and get as many birdies as possible and see what happens			0
it ’s a tough week obviously			0
i have done my day job and done it well but it is a long week and will take a lot out of me mentally but i have two weeks off after this and one round to go , so will give it my best shot			2
this is the only time in my career that i would be happy not to win a golf tournament			0
@entity121 will do me fine on sunday			0

@entity48 needs to finish in top two in @entity125 open to beat @entity1 from the final automatic *qualifying* place for @entity15 team
the scot carded a 69 third round to move only four shots off second place
' i would hate to be the person to deny him a place on the @entity4 , ' admits @entity27 , who is currently second in @entity24 *ahead* of the final round
