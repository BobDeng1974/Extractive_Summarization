by @entity0 published : 18:13 est , 23 june 2013 updated : 02:26 est , 24 june 2013 defence firms have been caught trying to charge the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds for @entity4 parties , magicians and even ‘ anticipated car accidents ’			2
defence secretary @entity7 has uncovered a string of startling claims submitted as part of multi-million - pound defence contracts			2
he said firms had got away with billing the @entity13 for ‘ inappropriate activities ’ because they did not have to provide a breakdown of what their charges were for			1
looking for savings : defence secretary @entity7 , left , and chancellor @entity20 , right , have agreed a deal over the weekend to cut down on profligacy in @entity13 spending such profligacy , however , will be squeezed under a spending deal agreed between mr @entity7 and chancellor @entity20 over the weekend			1
a review ordered by mr @entity7 has revealed extraordinary examples of ‘ expenses ’ which firms attempted to charge to the taxpayer , but have now been rejected			1
they included £ 16,500 for ‘ depreciation costs for executive flats ’ and £ 25,000 for ‘ cake , flowers and catering for a commissioning ceremony ’			2
other examples included £ 9,500 for ‘ staff team building ’ , £ 650 for ‘ 2 x magicians ’ , £ 24,000 for ‘ mugs for a launch ceremony ’ , £ 200 for ‘ attending @entity4 ’ , and £ 8,000 for non-specified ‘ entertainment ’			0
perhaps the most bizarre attempted charge under a defence contract was £ 50,000 for ‘ anticipated car accidents ( two a week at £ 500 ) ’			0
defence sources said that it appeared many such claims were waved through without proper checks under the last government			0
meanwhile , the chancellor said yesterday he had reached agreement with mr @entity7 over the @entity13 budget for 2015 - 16 as part of the @entity57 ’s spending review , to be unveiled on wednesday			1
there will be up to 2,000 further job losses among civilian personnel working for the ministry , but front - line servicemen will be protected from further cuts			0
mr @entity7 is also proposing a new independent watchdog to ensure that the taxpayer receives value for money from lucrative defence contracts which are currently not put out to tender			2
a system dating back more than four decades allows @entity71 companies to bid for some military contracts without competition , on the grounds that they are sensitive to national security			0
mr @entity7 said : ‘ it ’s vital that we get value for taxpayers ’ money in times of increasing financial pressures … increased transparency on single - source contracts will help ensure tight resources are being spent properly while still allowing industry fair profits			1
’ mr @entity20 told the @entity89 ’s @entity88 that he had now finalised a settlement with the @entity13 over its spending plans for 2015 - 16 after months of semi-public wrangling			1
the deal will mean between 1,000 and 2,000 further job losses – but no further reductions in military manpower			0
furthermore , around £ 250million in fines from banks guilty of rate - rigging will be used over the next 25 years to support troops and veterans .			0

@entity7 said firms were billing the @entity13 for ‘ inappropriate activities ’
mr @entity7 and @entity20 will be *clamping* down on @entity13 spending
