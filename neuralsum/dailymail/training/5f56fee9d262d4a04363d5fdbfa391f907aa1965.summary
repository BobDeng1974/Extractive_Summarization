by @entity0 published : 05:14 est , 14 september 2012 updated : 10:37 est , 14 september 2012 a newborn baby died from a severe brain injury after her breathing tube was dislodged in a hospital neo-natal unit , an inquest heard			1
there was a significant delay before staff realised the tube was displaced by which time tiny @entity11 , who only weighed two pounds and two ounces at birth , had been starved of oxygen			1
she suffered respiratory problems and was transferred from @entity16 to a specialist unit in @entity18 but later died when she was just 49 days old			2
@entity19 died from a severe brain injury after she was born prematurely and needed the help of a ventilator @entity23 told the hearing that @entity11 died from a hypoxic brain injury which appeared to have developed after the endotracheal tube attached to the ventilator becoming dislodged			1
the @entity18 inquest heard @entity11 was born prematurely by caesarean section after 27 weeks gestation on april 23 last year and was the seventh child of builder @entity32 , 37 , and his wife @entity34 , 26 , of @entity35 , @entity16			2
paediatric registrar dr @entity36 said the infant needed resuscitation and was given inflation breaths before being incubated and then placed on a ventilator			0
he failed three times to insert a 2.5 millimetre tube down @entity11 ’s trachea to help with her breathing and had to use a smaller 2mm tube			1
an independent expert who investigated the case said he found it ' puzzling ' why staff were unable to use the larger tube which opens up the airways more			0
@entity11 had difficulties because of the immaturity of her lungs and kidneys @entity11 's parents were at the inquest to hear about the death of their baby girl dr @entity36 said as the baby was put on the ventilator he got a ' crash call ' to help with another sick baby in the unit but claimed it did not affect his management of @entity68			1
despite her arterial blood - gas levels dipping overnight he saw an improvement and had no concern over the baby ’s neurological condition			0
' she had difficulties because of the immaturity of the lungs and kidneys but was making progress and going in the right direction , ' he said			0
the doctor told @entity80 , who represented @entity11 ’s parents , that he had no specific training in incubation procedures but the standard respiratory rate had been set for @entity68			1
that had to be reduced when the baby began over-ventilating			0
he conceded that incorrect settings on ventilators were a common cause of complications with babies and over-ventilation or under - ventilation could lead to brain damage			0
the doctor also defended only checking the baby ’s blood - gas levels every three or four hours and said more frequent checks could have adverse effects such as causing anaemia			0
dr @entity36 said he did not believe @entity11 merited a transfer to more specialist unit by april 25 and replacing her breathing tube would have subjected the baby to unnecessary trauma and ' caused more harm than good			1
' but a week later the baby ’s condition had deteriorated and and in the early hours of may 4 the breathing tube became displaced and @entity11 was starved of oxygen			1
dr @entity23 said his post-mortem after @entity11 died in her mother ’s arms on june 11 showed a long - standing hypoxic brain injury but there were a number of possible causes			1
he said it could be not enough blood to get oxygen to the brain , low blood pressure or anaemia , something affecting the blood vessels leading to the brain or ' it could be a combination of several factors rather than single event			0
' summer was transferred from @entity130 ( pictured ) to a specialist unit the pathologist said the aftermath of the brain damage was ' quite extensive and widespread ' and it was consistent with the events of may 4			0
after the bab7 deteriorated she suffered a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation and apparently afterwards suffered brain damage although no specific cause could be identified			2
dr @entity23 added that the brain injury was so severe it was ' unrecoverable			1
' if it had happened before may 4 it should have been picked up by two cranal ultrasound scans which were carried out in the previous week			0
@entity11 ’s parents had difficulty identifying her when they travelled to the @entity148 of @entity18 ’s @entity149 where she was taken			2
she showed no signs of improvement and the @entity152 had to agree to palliative care until she died			2
