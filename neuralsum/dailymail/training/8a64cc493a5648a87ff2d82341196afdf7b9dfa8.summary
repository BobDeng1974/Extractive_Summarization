new procedure : a study found that gently scratching the lining of the womb before @entity4 greatly increased the odds of pregnancy a simple scratch could double a woman ’s chances of having an @entity4 baby , doctors believe			1
a study found that gently scratching the lining of the womb before @entity4 greatly increased the odds of pregnancy , cutting the financial and emotional cost of repeated treatment			1
@entity4 costs between £ 3,000 and £ 15,000 a course , but just one in four of the 50,000 women who have it each year have a baby			1
the technique , called endometrial scratching , involves using an instrument similar to a coffee - stirrer to make four scratches on the lining of the womb			1
it costs around £ 300 and only takes a few minutes			1
doctors believe a fledgling embryo may find it easier to nestle in the furrows			2
it is also possible that the scratches release hormones that make the womb stickier and so the embryo finds it easier to implant			0
sir @entity37 – the @entity4 pioneer behind the birth of @entity40 , the world ’s first test - tube baby – was a firm believer in the technique			1
the practice fell out of favour as fertility treatment became more technical but some doctors feel it is time to bring it back			0
clinics around the world are researching it , and @entity54 ’s first proper trial of the technique has just finished			2
some 38 per cent of those given endometrial scratching with @entity4 became pregnant , compared with 20 per cent of those given @entity4 alone , the @entity68 ’s conference in @entity69 heard			1
a cheap form of @entity4 using baking soda is to be tested in @entity54 next month			1
it costs a third of the price of standard treatment as it does not involve expensive drugs and equipment			2
in conventional @entity4 , the embryo is grown with a mixture of nutrients in a large incubator with expensive carbon dioxide pumped through			1
but scientists from @entity87 in the @entity88 found the same effect using citric acid and sodium bicarbonate – baking soda			1
this enables the embryo to be grown in a smaller incubator , the size of a shoe box			0
the technique , called simplified culture system ( @entity99 ) , resulted in the birth of 18 healthy babies in @entity102 , with an overall success rate of about 34 per cent			2
in the trial next month , 50 @entity54 women under 37 will pay £ 1,000 to undergo the procedure – as opposed to at least £ 3,000 for standard @entity4			1
dr @entity107 of the @entity108 , which is overseeing the trial , said funding for @entity4 in the @entity54 is ‘ very limited ’ and that @entity99 could ‘ end the current postcode lottery because more cycles could be offered within the existing @entity114 budget constraints ’			2
@entity115 , of the @entity116 at @entity117 , said data on the technique is ‘ quite encouraging ’ , but clear evidence of its benefits are needed before all fertility doctors are advised to use it			2
professor @entity115 said : ‘ it ’s a very technically easy thing for a suitably trained gynaecologist to do			0
‘ it ’s not the most pleasant thing … we advocate that the woman has a paracetamol before she comes in			0
‘ after a cup of tea , the vast majority of women will be able to drive home			0
’ the consultant gynaecologist , who was mentored by sir @entity37 , said : ‘ when we were putting embryos back … he said , “ make a little scratch when you put them in ”			0
and we thought , “ that ’s not right , you should be putting them in very , very delicately and carefully ” , and it ’s turned full circle now			0
’ he added that the procedure ‘ would be brilliant if it did work ’			0
@entity152 , of @entity155 ’s @entity154 fertility unit , said studies have had mixed results			0
but , on balance , successes outweigh the failures			0
‘ it is possible that only a certain sub-group of patients may see an increase in pregnancy and birth rates and that the benefit is restricted to those with previous unsuccessful attempts at @entity4 , ’ he said			1
dr @entity152 added that there is some scepticism about the practice because ‘ we remain uncertain of the underlying mechanism ’ .			0
