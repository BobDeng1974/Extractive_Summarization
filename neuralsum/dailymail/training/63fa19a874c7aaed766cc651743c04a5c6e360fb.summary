the extent to which the @entity1 overshadows @entity4 football ’s ruling body will be demonstrated when the @entity5 publish their annual accounts			1
the figures for the year ending july 2014 put the @entity5 ’s turnover at £ 332million , with a gross profit of £ 261m			1
these are big numbers and compare favourably with the @entity11 , who turned over £ 152.2m during the same period			2
but they are dwarfed by the £ 5.1billion the @entity1 gained for their domestic tv rights over three years , with more billions to come from overseas deals			1
the @entity5 's £ 261million profit is dwarfed by the new @entity1 mega deal , worth £ 5.1billion the @entity5 will have to change general secretary @entity18 's review , after he wrote about the signing of a sponsor for the 2014 - 15 @entity22 , which never happened @entity23 paid the @entity1 an average of £ 11.1m per game — the same amount the @entity5 brought in from their combined annual increase in broadcasting , sponsorship and licensing			1
meanwhile , the @entity5 will have to alter former general secretary @entity18 ’s review , written last november , contained in the accounts			1
he wrote about the signing of a sponsor for the 2014 - 15 @entity22 which never happened			2
@entity18 also singled out @entity34 as a leading match official ‘ setting a global standard ’			2
she was at the women ’s under 20 @entity37 but has n’t been an assistant referee for a @entity1 game this season — first because of injury and now because she is pregnant			1
more evidence that @entity43 are orchestrating the three - strong presidential challenge to @entity45 came with their strategist @entity46 ’s @entity47 helping to launch @entity49 ’s campaign in @entity50 this week			0
the same company also helped @entity53 ’s @entity52 of @entity54 launch his candidature on the same ‘ @entity57 ’ ticket a fortnight ago			0
@entity47 have helped @entity49 ( second left ) and @entity52 ( second right ) to launch campaigns against @entity59 president @entity45 the @entity60 have set a dangerous precedent by allowing struggling @entity63 one - day captain @entity62 to play in the whole of the @entity65			1
his £ 156,000 deal with @entity67 means he will miss the one - day international against @entity68 on may 8 when he would have been due to lead the side — form permitting — and that means @entity63 will need to pick another skipper , devaluing the position			2
it ’s still questionable business as usual at @entity59 with the extraordinary early sale of the @entity76 tv rights to @entity77 in the @entity78 without a tender — to the fury of @entity81 and other rival networks			1
the @entity78 are favourites to host that tournament and delaying selling the rights until the location is decided could have brought in far more money			1
but @entity77 have been the biggest opponents of the switch to a winter @entity37 in @entity89 and this deal will ensure they do n’t take legal action			2
@entity59 have sold the rights to the @entity76 in @entity78 to @entity77 - to the fury of @entity81 and other rivals judo thrown into chaos former @entity98 chief executive @entity97 , now chief global brand officer of mixed martial arts ’ @entity101 , engineered £ 250,000 in sponsorship for the @entity104 ’s hosting of the @entity105 in @entity106 in april			1
however , the @entity109 , led by @entity108 @entity107 , have cancelled the event at short notice in protest at the partnership			0
@entity97 said : ‘ it ’s outrageous to do this with just eight weeks to go and after so much planning had gone into staging the event in @entity106			0
if they did n’t want our money then cancel the sponsorship rather than the @entity105			0
’ former @entity98 chief executive @entity97 engineered £ 250,000 in sponsorship for the @entity104 's hosting of the @entity124 , but the event has been cancelled at short notice the patrons of @entity128 ’s west car park , including long - standing debenture holders , have been further antagonised by the @entity11 ’s commercial obsession			2
this has seen the @entity133 champagne facility moved a short distance to new premises , further marginalising the dwindling space left for west car park users to enjoy food and drink from their own car boots			0
they include @entity142 , chairman of the @entity11 management committee , and @entity145 , chairman of the @entity146			0
but making money comes first at @entity128			0
one of @entity149 ’s last acts as @entity151 manager was to recommend the appointment of @entity153 football reporter @entity53 as the new communications chief at @entity155			0
unfortunately , @entity54 ’s first day in the job coincided with the arrival of new manager @entity159			0
@entity149 recommended the appointment of @entity53 as communications chief at @entity151			0

@entity5 to *continue* in @entity1 's shadow when they publish accounts
their profit is dwarfed by the £ *5billion* tv deal for the @entity4 top *flight*
@entity60 set dangerous precedent in allowing @entity62 to play @entity65 season
@entity59 have sold the @entity76 tv rights in @entity78 to @entity77
