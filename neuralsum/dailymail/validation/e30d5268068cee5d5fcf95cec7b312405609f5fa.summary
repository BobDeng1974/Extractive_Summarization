bosses at trendy clothing firm @entity1 have been rapped for a ' too sexy ' advert showing a female model wearing a ' thong bodysuit '			1
the firm , which has more than 270 stores across the world , regularly has its raunchy ads banned by the @entity9 ( @entity9 )			1
in 2012 the firm had a string of ads banned in four different rulings after using photos of women exposing their breasts , showing off their bare bums and posing with their legs spread in its ad campaigns			0
this @entity1 advert featuring an underage - looking model has been banned by the @entity9 and this week , the @entity9 again banned an advert showing a flame - haired model wearing a £ 30 spandex thong bodysuit covered with lipstick prints			1
one person had complained to the @entity9 saying they believed the model in question looked under the age of 16 and that it was ' irresponsible and offensive ' as it ' sexualised a model ' who appeared to be underage			1
bosses at the @entity9 said that despite @entity1 saying the model was 20 years old , she looked ' youthful ' and that the ad was irresponsible			1
it stated : ' we considered the model had a youthful appearance and that some consumers were likely to regard her as being younger than 16 years of age			2
' the model was shown looking back at the camera over her shoulder with her buttocks visible			1
the campaign featured more than one picture of the girl in the bodysuit to ' [ depict ] the thong from various angles ' ' we considered that readers were likely to interpret the model 's expression and pose as being sexual in nature			1
' in conjunction with the youthful appearance of the model , we considered the ad could be seen to sexualise a child			0
' we therefore concluded that the ad was irresponsible and was likely to cause serious offence			0
' it added : ' the ad must not appear again in its current form			0
' we told @entity1 ( @entity67 ) ltd to ensure future ads did not include images that inappropriately sexualised young women or were likely to cause serious offence			1
' bosses at the clothing firm said the the model was 20 and that the ad ' depicted the thong from various angles '			2
this is n't the first time that @entity1 has been in trouble for their adverts			2
last september , a campaign for the fashion brand @entity1 has been banned for ‘ sexualising school - age girls ’			1
photographs of its ‘ @entity88 ’ range included a young woman bending over in an ultra- short tartan skirt with her white underwear on display			0
in a scathing attack , the advertising watchdog labelled the campaign ‘ gratuitous ’ and ‘ sexist ’			0
the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) said ‘ the focus was on her buttocks and groin rather than on the skirt being modelled ’			2
it also accused the firm of promoting seedy ‘ up - skirt ’ photographs – when unauthorised pictures are taken from beneath a woman ’s skirt			0
the brand launched its @entity108 range with the slogan , ‘ your first assignment is to dress accordingly			0
’ last year , the fashion company got in trouble for this picture of a ' schoolgirl ' leaning over a car door the campaign included pictures of a model bent over touching the ground , revealing her crotch and underwear , while another showed a woman bending over a red car in a thigh - skimming green tartan skirt and her buttocks on show			1
the @entity9 said : ‘ we considered the images were gratuitous and objectified women , and were therefore sexist and likely to cause serious and widespread offence			2
last january , the brand stirred up controversy for decking out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair			0
a storefront at the retailer 's @entity140 location in @entity142 featured three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear , exposing their unkempt bikini lines .			0

@entity1 has been told off by the @entity9
