by @entity0 meet @entity1 the turbo tortoise , who can cover 18ft in a world record 19.59 seconds			1
the young leopard tortoise stunned spectators as he crossed the finish line in less than half the time as the previous record			1
in fact before @entity1 came along , the last tortoise to reach anywhere near was back in 1977 when @entity12 set the record of 43.7 seconds			1
@entity1 the tortoise has broken the world record for an 18ft ' sprint ' , clocking a time of just 19.59 seconds - less than half the time of the previous world best - and even pulled a @entity19 pose afterwards @entity1 is a leopard tortoise , thought to be nine years old , from @entity22 theme park in @entity23 the tortoise , who lives at the @entity22 theme park in @entity23 , was placed on a specially - built 18ft - long uphill course in front of crowds of visitors			1
despite fears he might get cold feet on the big day , @entity1 , thought to be around nine - years - old , did not disappoint those who turned up to watch him rocket up the wooden track - even finishing with a victory wave as he crossed the chequered line			1
@entity37 , owner of @entity22 , said : ‘ @entity1 loves going outside for a walk , as soon as we put him down he ’s off and running			2
‘ visitors are always remarking how fast he is			0
he ’s like the @entity19 of the tortoise world			0
‘ not only has he smashed the world record , he ’s obliterated it completely			0
i think it will stand for a long time now , without a shadow of a doubt			0
’ on his first attempt he managed a time of 21.47 seconds , well under @entity12 ’s effort at the @entity50 37 years previously			1
and then - just to show off - he went on to shave a further two seconds off his time			2
@entity22 owner @entity37 ( pictured ) said the park thought to put @entity1 to the test after visitors kept on remarking on how fast he ran the previous world record of 43.7 seconds was set in 1977 by @entity12 and remained unbroken fro 37 years his keepers and officials from the @entity59 were there to keep a check on the race			1
@entity1 was given to the adventure park and animal farm three years ago when its owners went to live abroad			2
the park is always popular with visitors and it was they who first spotted his love of speed			0
@entity72 , of @entity73 , said : ‘ he ’d be put out for exercise and visitors would say “ he can move ; we did n’t realise tortoises could be that fast ”			0
’ they checked the record books and , after a training programme that saw @entity1 set a personal best of 20 seconds , decided to put him to the official test which meant strict regulations , adjudicators in place and stop - watches at the ready			1
the course was made to the exact specifications of the original and included a slight gradient but @entity1 , putting fellow animal residents to shame , sprinted off at a cracking pace			0
@entity1 has some way to go to beat the real @entity19 , however , who holds the world record for the sprint with a time of 9.58 seconds he did two runs , first setting a time of 21 seconds then , confidence building , came his personal best			1
at a third attempt he began to flag but by then he had earned his finishing - line treat which was a cut - up strawberry , a change from his regular grassy diet			0
the farm is now awaiting an official certificate which will be displayed on a pen shared by @entity1 and his female friend tortoise @entity114			2
mr @entity37 said : ‘ i ’m so proud of him , so pleased			0
now hopefully we will get that official recognition			0
