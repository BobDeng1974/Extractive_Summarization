by @entity0 deprived : mr @entity1 said that female ' gatekeepers ' make it harder for boys to enjoy reading boys are being put off reading because of the influence women have on children ’s literature , says an award - winning children ’s author			1
@entity1 warned that children ’s books were too girly because of the influence of mostly female panels of editors , publishers , reviewers and judges			1
one publishing company ’s research suggested women bought 95 per cent of picture books for children , he added			1
the writer believes boys are being starved of what they enjoy in books , such as swashbuckling pirates , battles , or technical details about space ships and so are driven to more action - packed video games instead			2
' it is a really difficult argument to make because 99 times out of 100 it is women that are under - represented , ’ said mr @entity1			1
‘ but there is a literacy gap - boys are underachieving , boys do not like books as much as girls			2
‘ i am arguing that this is because the industry is dominated by female gatekeepers			1
’ the author and illustrator , a former winner of the @entity52 for ‘ @entity53 ’ , looked at 450 reviews in five national newspapers			2
he found 41 per cent of children ’s fiction books were by men but more than two - thirds of reviews were by women			1
men were responsible for 47 per cent of picture books but more than 80 per cent of reviews were by women			2
study : mr @entity1 conducted a study uncovering the large proportions of publishers , reviewers and award judges who are female and he found for the past two years , every one of the 13 judges of the prestigious children ’s book awards , the @entity73 and @entity74 medals , has been women			1
he also drew on personal experience , explaining how only two of the 50 editors he had dealt with were men			0
one publishing company told him it carried out research which suggested women bought 95 per cent of picture books for children			1
‘ mums and grans buy books - that ’s what ’s driving the market , ’ he told @entity88			0
‘ they read the book also and then there ’s a tendency for the book to reflect their tastes as well			0
so there may be a pirate but that pirate will not be engaged in a battle			0
‘ the number of times i have tried to get technical information into a book and it is deemed inappropriate			0
‘ it is one of the things that leads boys and girls with boy - typical tastes , to say “ i am not really interested in that kind of content , i am more interested in the content of video games ”			0
’ a gap in reading ability is already apparent between boys and girls by the time they are five , according to a parliamentary commission report			0
this translates into a year ’s difference in reading skills as they go through school .			0
