@entity1 scientists believe a seed from a rainforest plant could hold the key to curing cancer			2
researchers say initial tests of the @entity9 tree has found is was effective 70 per cent of the time			1
an experimental drug based on the seed was even found to be effective in treating pets with cancer			1
the new drug , @entity15 - 46 , is a compound extracted from the fruit of the @entity9 tree which is found in north @entity19 rainforests			1
@entity15 - 46 is a compound extracted from the fruit of the @entity22			1
the tree which is found in north @entity19 rainforests			2
scientists at @entity24 found a single injection of the drug @entity27 led to rapid breakdown of tumours in a range of human tumour models			1
the study , published in the journal @entity34 , was led by dr @entity35			2
he says the findings suggest the drug could be effective in human patients			0
' we were able to achieve very strong results injecting @entity27 directly into melanoma models , as well as cancers of the head , neck and colon , ' dr @entity35 said			2
' in most cases the single injection treatment caused the loss of viability of cancer cells within four hours , and ultimately destroyed the tumours			1
' dr @entity35 says @entity27 works in part by triggering a cellular response which effectively cuts off the blood supply to the tumour			0
' in more than 70 per cent of pre-clinical cases , the response and cure was long - term and enduring , with very little relapse over a period of 12 months			1
' @entity15 - 46 is a compound extracted from the fruit of the @entity9 tree which is found in north @entity19 rainforests			1
@entity27 was discovered by the @entity19 biotechnology company @entity65			0
the drug is being developed as a human and veterinary pharmaceutical through @entity65 ' subsidiary company @entity69			0
@entity19 @entity1 , near the reserve @entity71 , where the fruit is found			2
researchers found it could be effective at treating cancers in humans			0
the experimental drug has been used by practising veterinarians to successfully destroy or shrink tumours in pets â€“ including dogs , cats and horses			1
@entity85 is currently undertaking formal veterinary clinical trials with @entity27 in @entity1 and the @entity87			0
a final regulatory approval is still required for a human phase i clinical trial			0
dr @entity35 says @entity24 is keen to pursue further research to determine if @entity27 could be made more effective			0
' we must stress at this point that @entity27 will only be trialled in the short - term for tumours which can be accessed by direct injection or topical application , ' dr @entity35 said			1
' there is no evidence to suggest @entity27 would be effective against metastatic cancers			0
' the pre-clinical trials at @entity24 have been largely funded by @entity69 with additional support from the @entity103 .			0

fruit from the @entity9 tree caused tumours to break down in 70 *%* of cases
single injection worked within four hours
has been used experimentally in pets with good results
