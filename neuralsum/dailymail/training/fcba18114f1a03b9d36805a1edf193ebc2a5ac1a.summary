but after several days in hospital , she appeared to be recovering , her father @entity11 said			0
@entity4 , 22 , died four months after suffering a heart attack - on the day she was due to be discharged from hospital ' he said : ' she was happy as a pig in muck - she was coming home			1

the inquest heard that after her heart attack , ms @entity4 had a stent fitted to widen her artery and was on a twice - daily medication called ticagrelor			1
this is designed to prevent clots from forming in blood vessels by thinning the blood			0
after returning to hospital with coughing problems , she was diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism - a blockage in the artery that transports blood to the lungs			2
as a result of her coughing up ‘ life - threatening ’ amounts of blood , doctors took the decision to reduce her ticagrelor dosage , due to fears she may lose even more blood			2
ms @entity4 has been admitted to the @entity7 in @entity8 after coughing up blood dr @entity54 , who helped treat ms @entity4 , said the decision was taken to reduce her risk of dying from blood loss - but added it did increase the chance of complications with her stent			1
