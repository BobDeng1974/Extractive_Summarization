the audience ate up @entity0 's remarks , clapping loudly , and making supportive comments throughout			1
' i have n't been beaten down by the system , and i have a good job and skills , that i can go back to at any point in time i want , so i 'm unafraid to do what 's right , and i think @entity13 will be the same , ' @entity0 continued			1
' and besides , we 've already tried a community organizer , and i 'd rather have someone that knows how to create jobs rather than just how to spend the money , ' he said , taking a jab at @entity122			0
@entity0 told the audience that the @entity14 has ' plenty of lawyers ' but only a few businessmen			1

he later served as ceo of @entity30 , where he says he created 20,000 jobs , before starting his own firm in 2011			0

this is a part of @entity34 business , part of any business , ' he said			2
' outsourcing is the procurement of products and services to help your business run , ' he added			0

we are twice what @entity238 's tax rate is			0
i never thought i 'd be on a stage saying that i 'm envious of @entity238 's tax code , ' he said to laughter from the audience			0
' we have a regulatory burden of two trillion dollars a year , a tax burden of three trillion dollars a year , and we 're not gon na improve it until we figure out one simple thing : you want @entity28 to do better ? you want @entity28 to create jobs ? you got ta leave more money in @entity28 and send less money to @entity35 , ' he said			0
@entity0 told @entity9 in an interview after the event that he thinks the @entity14 ' could use a fresh perspective ' from someone with business experience like @entity13			1
' you know , currently we have a president who never ran a business , never really ever employed anybody , or really worked in the private sector			0
so i think he really , the current president , does n't have as much of an understanding of how jobs are created , ' he said			2
' and i think someone from the business community probably has a better understanding of that			0
' @entity13 said in his stump speech friday that he 's running for the @entity14 because he ' got so fed up with what 's coming out of @entity35 ... and i want to do something about it			1

on thursday president @entity122 told an @entity297 radio station that a @entity189 win ' means that @entity299 keep control of the @entity14			1
' a @entity221 / @entity302 poll released today shows @entity189 leading @entity13 47 - 44 with a three percent margin of error			0
if neither @entity189 nor @entity13 are able to neutralize @entity307 candidate @entity306 , who is polling at five percent , before @entity308 to reach the state 's mandatory 50 percent threshold , the race will go to a run off in january - after the new legislative session in @entity35 has already commenced .			1
