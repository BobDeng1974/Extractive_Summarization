she was the barefooted sixties singer who secured @entity3 ’s first ever @entity2 title , so it would be fair to expect her to take centre stage at the contest ’s 60th anniversary celebrations			1
but @entity8 yesterday claimed she had been snubbed			1
the 68 - year - old said she was bemused as to why the @entity10 had not invited her to take part in the @entity2 ’s @entity13 concert and urged her fans to email the tv show ’s executive producer @entity15 to ask why			1
since then just four other @entity3 entrants have taken first place in the contest			1
but despite her special place in @entity2 history , the singer was not invited to perform and also claimed her offer to help with hosting ‘ did not receive a positive response ’			1
the star took to her @entity34 page late on monday to post : ‘ hi @entity15 ’s i have had a few messages asking why i am not doing the @entity2 60 years celebration i ca n’t answer the question so why not ask the man organising it here			1
’ miss @entity8 ’s fans deluged the show ’s executive producer with angry emails insisting she be included , until miss @entity8 was forced to remove his contact details from her post			1
she then subsequently put up a lengthy post on her page in which she described the matter as a ‘ ding dong ’ and hinted there may have been doubts over her vocal range			0
however she insisted she had no problems performing the tune that turned her into a household name , in a lower key			0
miss @entity8 was the barefooted sixties singer who secured @entity3 ’s first ever title at the @entity2 in @entity58 in april 1967 ( pictured ) she took @entity19 by storm with her song @entity21 , which won the coveted @entity2 title by 47 votes miss @entity8 said : ‘ i have not offered to sing on it			1
i have not been asked to sing on it			0
i have had in the recent past no problem singing puppet			0
‘ i recently sang it every night for a year on the @entity70 tour , in a lower key as my vocal range has changed over the years , as it does with every singer			0
however after the tour i announced my retirement from live singing			0
‘ i did offer last month as a gesture of support of the 60th celebration to do some hosting which i believe is more appropriate but did not receive a positive response			2
‘ i do not know why i have not been asked to be involved			0
’ miss @entity8 ’s clash with the @entity10 and the decision not to include her comes at a time when the broadcaster has faced repeated criticism for failing to properly represent older women in their programming			1
but despite her special place in @entity2 history , the singer was not invited to perform and also claimed her offer to help with hosting ‘ did not receive a positive response ’ in 2012 @entity95 , the then director general of the @entity10 , admitted there were not enough older women broadcasting on the corporation , especially in ‘ iconic roles and on iconic topical programmes			1
’ @entity2 ’s @entity13 will be presented by @entity101 and @entity104 comedian and presenter @entity102 and will be broadcast on @entity10 and throughout @entity19 this @entity105			1
it will kick start celebrations to mark 60 years of the annual music event			2
@entity108 , who won in 1976 with @entity110 , are the only @entity3 act billed to perform at the concert			2
all four members : @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 are now aged 65			0
other performers will include last year ’s winner 26 - year - old @entity120 , from @entity121 , @entity104 ’s @entity122 and @entity124 ’s @entity123			0
the @entity2 final will take place after the concert on may 23rd and will be hosted in @entity58 for the first time since miss @entity8 won there in 1969 , making her absence from the concert all the more significant			1
some suggested miss @entity8 may have been excluded because she has previously criticised the singing contest , calling it ‘ c * * p ’			2
last year she told music magazine @entity135 : ‘ i thought the @entity2 was c * * p , it was n’t even on my or my friends ’ radar			2
i ’m a post-war baby and the whole idea of countries fighting again seemed ridiculous			0
’ she also said she hated her winning song , adding : ‘ when i got lumbered with singing puppet on a string i knew there would be a lot of fans who would n’t want me doing it			2
’ @entity152 , 66 , became the second @entity3 winner in 1969 when she came joint first with @entity154 , @entity155 and with her hit @entity156			2
@entity108 were the first @entity3 band to win with @entity110 in 1976 , @entity157 , who formed specifically for @entity2 , sang their way to first place with @entity161 in 1981 and in 1997 @entity162 became the first @entity3 winner in 16 years with @entity164			1
a spokesman for the @entity10 said : ‘ @entity2 ’s @entity13 is a special event co-produced by the @entity10 and @entity167 kick - starting the 60th anniversary of the world ’s favourite song contest			1
the concert has a star - studded line - up of singers containing original acts performing their iconic songs once again			0
‘ as a 90 - minute show , it would be impossible to include all 1400 acts that have entered the contest over the years , this means that difficult decisions have to be made regarding the line - up on the night but we hope that there is something for everyone to enjoy in this special one - off concert that will be broadcast throughout @entity19 and beyond			0
’ she is currently married to her third husband @entity188			0
the singer is now a qualified psychotherapist and runs a clinic in @entity192 .			0

@entity8 says @entity10 did *n't* invite to her @entity2 **'s** 60th celebrations
@entity196 had secured the @entity3 **'s** first ever title with @entity21 in 1967
but she claims she was snubbed by tv execs and urged fans to ask why
