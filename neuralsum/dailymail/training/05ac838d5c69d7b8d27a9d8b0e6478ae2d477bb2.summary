the @entity1 dressing - room knows @entity2 is leaving			1
it might be next week , next month , or in just under a year ’s time			1
but they know he is going			2
this piece of information first entered the public domain just hours before a pitiful performance in last friday night ’s 2 - 0 defeat from @entity12			2
and it continues to sit there like a tailor - made get - out clause if this mostly experienced group of players continues to under - perform			1
captain @entity18 insists , however , that they will not reach for it			1
he is adamant there can be no further recourse to blaming bad results on the whirlwind of uncertainty which continues to engulf the club			2
captain @entity18 looked in good spirits during @entity1 training on friday instead , the defender has urged his team - mates to look within for reasons why @entity1 have suffered three losses and a draw during a deeply damaging six - game spell			1
@entity2 was adamant on friday that he intends to work his 12 - month notice period			1
it could be argued that some players might toil for maximum motivation whilst fully aware that their manager is , at whatever speed , on his way out			1
‘ it should n’t be the case because there is self - motivation as well , ’ he insisted			2
‘ there are seven , eight , nine players out of contract this summer			1
‘ as players , we are backing the manager with everything he has done for us			1
we want to do better for him , for ourselves , for the fans			2
@entity18 says uncertainty surrounding manager @entity2 can not be used as an excuse for poor results ‘ it ’s not just about one thing here but people do have to look in the mirror after the last two or three games and ask if they have done enough			1
‘ do we have to do more for the manager ? on the pitch , definitely			0
especially in the last few games			0
‘ as i said , it comes to down to looking in the mirror and asking if you have done enough			2
did i play like a @entity1 player should play ? ‘ it ’s slightly harder playing for a club like this and you ca n’t be hiding			1
you have got to be demanding and taking the ball			0
we need 11 players doing that			2
’ that certainly was n’t the case at @entity80 as @entity1 handed yet another advantage to @entity82 in the @entity84 title race			1
so did the news that @entity2 had handed in his notice have an impact on their efforts ? @entity90 called on his players to look in the mirror and ask if they are doing enough ‘ the biggest thing for me is that if you put excuses in front of players then , nine times out of ten , they will look to take those excuses , ’ said @entity18			1
‘ we probably could have covered up the last two or three games by using excuses about the timing of things coming out and so on			2
‘ but for me it ’s about trying to get the dressing room to forget about everything that has gone on and try to get our game back — and some points back on the league leaders			1
‘ we need to just concentrate on ourselves and forget all the excuses that are round about us			2
it ’s about concentrating on being a football player , turning up focused on the job and your individual job within the team			0
’ @entity2 was all smiles as he looked relaxed in training ahead of saturday 's match with @entity121 @entity18 insisted that he had n’t spoken directly to @entity2 about the situation , which seems somewhat curious given his standing within the squad			1
‘ i think if i wanted to know then i could go and chap his door , ’ he added			0
‘ and i think if there ’s anything i need to know , he would come and tell me			0
so there is no issue			0
‘ i ’m not aware of anything else that is going on at the club			0
it ’s probably a good thing			0
my job is just to try and keep players focused going into a game			2
and not thinking about things outwith that			0
‘ have i seen a difference in the manager ? not at all			0
i did n’t see it coming , but that ’s all i know			0
’ it was interesting when @entity18 suggested the current climate around the club somehow felt similar to the bleak financial crisis of 2012 and the descent into administration			1
it was something he could n’t , or would n’t , explain in any detail , but perhaps it indicates the extraordinary sense of flux within @entity1 just now			1
@entity2 , who tendered his resignation earlier this month , oversees the session at @entity156 beyond the manager ’s situation , a number of long - serving staff have been made redundant as part of a cost - cutting programme			1
that was led by former @entity165 managing director @entity164 , who was on friday appointed as chief executive in a sign that @entity169 ’s influence is being further cemented			0
amid all this , @entity1 sit nine points adrift of a @entity82 side who have a game in hand			1
a run of exceptional consistency is now required , beyond anything they have mounted so far this term			0
asked if they were capable of a winning streak between now and the end of the season , @entity18 replied : ‘ it ’s possible , it ’s definitely possible			1
we have got the players , the squad , the strength in depth			2
‘ in the last couple of weeks we have not had the mentality			0
but we have got it in the dressing room			0
it ’s just let us down in the last couple of weeks with our eye being taken off the ball by various things			0
@entity18 believes @entity1 have the players to arrest their slump and put together a winning run ‘ what gives me confidence ? past results , performances , beating @entity208 teams — three or four this season			1
lots and lots of things			0
we are just on a wee dip			0
a dip in form and maybe confidence as well and it ’s up to ourselves and each other to get out of it			0
‘ we were on a great run of form before and that ’s exactly what we have to get back to			0
we had eight straight wins , conceding just two goals			0
we were working hard and scoring goals , showing a desire to pull on a @entity1 strip and deal with pulling on a @entity1 strip which is quite a big thing			1
then all of a sudden we ’ve hit a lull			0
‘ you would n’t think there is any margin for error , with @entity82 nine points ahead and having a game in hand — – albeit we still have them twice to play and there are @entity242 derbies			1
i do n’t know for sure , but i do n’t think there is any margin for error			0
