it is estimated that at any one time , more than 200,000 patients have a hard - to - heal wound , and the cost to the @entity13 is up to £ 3 billion a year			1
a wound is defined as being chronic if it takes more than six weeks to heal			0
fish skin from cod caught in the @entity5 is being used as a way to help kick - start the healing of chronic wounds wounds that typically become chronic include foot ulcers ( a common complication of diabetes which can lead to gangrene and amputation ) , pressure sores or bed sores , and leg ulcers ( caused by high blood pressure )			1
this failure to heal can occur for a variety of reasons , ranging from poor blood and oxygen supply to a weakened immune system and low levels of growth factors necessary for healing tissue			2
as a result , the scaffolding around which cells should gather to create new tissue to seal the wound does not work properly , leaving it open and inflamed , sometimes for years			2
a wide range of treatments have been used , including antibiotics , new types of dressings and ultrasound			0
the idea behind the new treatment , known as @entity53 ( @entity54 ) , is to provide a natural scaffolding to help new tissue grow and to complete the healing process			1
the advantage of fish skin is that it similar to human skin , with the addition of omega 3 oils ( which reduces inflammation to boost healing )			1
it is estimated that at any one time , more than 200,000 patients have a hard - to - heal wound , and the cost to the @entity13 is up to £ 3 ¿ billion a year the fish skin comes from cod farmed in the @entity5 off @entity69			1
it is processed to remove most of the cells — leaving the connective tissue and fat behind — and then sterilised			2
this is placed over the wound			0
over time , the fish skin is converted into living , human tissue			1
small trials conducted by @entity80 , the @entity69 - based company behind the treatment , have shown promising results			0
in one , ten patients with serious non-healing wounds received the treatment for 28 days			0
all the wounds treated improved , with six completely healing			2
none of the wounds had responded to hospital - standard treatment for at least six months before the trial started			2
in another study involving 37 patients , a year after treatment 36 of the patients had improved — the 37th did not improve but the wound did not get worse , according to dr @entity98 , medical director of @entity99			0
it ’s hoped that the fish skin could also be used in surgery for hernia repair and breast reconstruction , again as a scaffold for new tissue to grow on			1
dr @entity107 , a consultant dermatologist at @entity108 and the @entity109 said : ‘ chronic non-healing wounds are a huge issue for patients , causing enormous suffering , and are often resistant to treatment			0
‘ thus , any new effective therapy would be most welcome			0
' this new technology has been tested on some patients with encouraging results and has recently been approved for use in the @entity120 ‘ it is , however , important to recognise that tests so far have been in small numbers of patients and its true effectiveness is yet to be fully appreciated .			0
