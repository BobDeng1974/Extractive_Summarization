by @entity0 published : 19:42 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 22 july 2013 the tempestuous relationship between @entity2 and @entity3 still has the potential to shock almost four decades later			1
a major new @entity6 drama about the @entity8 lovers had to be re-written because it was littered with too many swear words			1
@entity6 bosses panicked when they received the first draft of ‘ @entity13 ’ which will be broadcast tomorrow night on @entity14 because it contained 49 different uses of the @entity16 as well as a reference to the c word			1
one source close to the production , which stars @entity22 and @entity23 said bosses ordered a re-write to edit out the swearing @entity2 and @entity3 , who married and divorced each other twice over - both swore like troopers particularly during their spectacular off - screen bust - ups			1
but producers thought the language in the original script was too blue even for a drama to be broadcast at 9.00 pm			1
one source close to the production , which stars @entity22 and @entity23 said : ' the @entity6 thought the language in the production was a problem and @entity38 the writer was asked to remove a lot of the swearing			1
' bosses said " @entity43 we love the script but we simply ca n’t have 49 f * * * s and a c - word "			1
' @entity43 was just trying to capture the rhythm of their speech and simply had n’t realised just how much swearing he had included in the script			1
' the toned down version of the screenplay still does n’t pull any punches and it may still strike some viewers as too risque			1
the tempestuous pair - who married twice - became lovers on the set of the film @entity58 both characters , who became lovers on the set of the film @entity58 , use the f word including in one scene where they row and @entity2 slaps her husband around the face			1
he tells her to stop ‘ f * * * ing hitting him ’ and she says she will when he ‘ f * * * ing apologises ’ in another scene @entity3 uses the c - word to describe the critics who have just savaged the production of private lives in which they are both starring			1
the drama focuses on the couple ’s decision to star in a 1983 production of @entity80 ’s comedy about a divorced couple			1
although the two stars , who made eleven films together , are no longer lovers they ca n’t help but reminisce about their previous sex life			1
in one scene set in a hotel room @entity3 bemoans the fact that he is getting older and that he struggled to ‘ get his sword of his sheath and wave it about a bit ’ during a recent production of @entity94			1
@entity2 , seen here with @entity3 , is portrayed as still being deeply in love with the actor and desperate to rekindle their romance a delighted @entity2 tells him ' not like you @entity3 , ' before she is told off for having the mind of a ‘ collier ’			1
@entity2 then asks her former husband ' how do you f * * * anyway ? you can barely move ? ' he replies : ' there are ways and means my love			2
' remember that train we took to @entity113 and we lay there and let the rocking of the carriage do the job			2
' in a flashback scene , set ten years earlier @entity3 asks his wife why she is dressed like an ‘ over-ripe tart ’ while they are preparing to exercise in a hotel room			1
she replies : ' i thought maybe we could screw afterwards , ' and then bemoans the state of her breasts			2
she tells @entity3 : ' i am holding my bosom			2
its bouncing up and down			2
@entity3 i am 40 years of age			2
they are 40 years of age			2
they have gained a certain amount of elasticity			2
' a besotted @entity3 tells her : ' you are so gorgeous			0
your tits are gorgeous , your arse is gorgeous , your legs , your belly , did i mention your tits ? let ’s just screw			0
' she tells him : ' we can be extra vigorous			0
' @entity2 is portrayed as still being deeply in love with @entity3 and desperate to rekindle their romance			1
she is resentful of @entity3 ’s new found love for actress @entity151 who he would eventually marry during the run of private lives			0
for his part @entity3 wants to re-assure that @entity2 she will always have place in his life even though he realises he most move on			0
he tells her : ' i will always love you @entity2 , as long as i live			0
but us together it will destroy me			0
i ca n’t do it			0
that is what i had to say to you			0
that is why i did this bloody job			0
' dr @entity167 , an @entity168 at @entity169 , who was a close friend of @entity3 ’s and who organised the couple ’s second wedding reception said : ' i think that was the case			0
he did try and move on and eventually he did			0
' he and @entity2 remained in constant contact and they did telephone each other a lot			0
' but all of that was understood by @entity151 who supported him and was an actual saint			0
' @entity181 , the @entity182 - based hair stylist who was one of @entity2 ’s friends said the fact that she swore a lot simply added to her appeal			0
he said : ' so what			0
she was a real person who was passionate about life			0
' ' she said what she wanted to say and i applaud her for being herself			0
