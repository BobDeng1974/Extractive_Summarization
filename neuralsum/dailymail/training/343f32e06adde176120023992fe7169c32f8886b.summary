by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 11:26 am on 1st july 2011 emergency law change : policing minister @entity3 said that legislation will have to be clarified thousands of criminal suspects could lodge compensation claims as a result of the chaos over police bail rules			1
senior police officers fear alleged murderers , rapists and paedophiles could demand payouts of hundreds of pounds under human rights laws			2
the revelation came as ministers pledged to rush through laws to reverse the ‘ bizarre ’ ruling , revealed in yesterday ’s @entity20 , which tears up 25 years of legal precedent and puts a straitjacket on officers ’ ability to question suspects			1
as a result of the ruling , made by a district judge earlier this year , time spent on bail now counts towards the maximum of 96 hours suspects can be held in custody			1
previously , the clock stopped when alleged offenders were let out , allowing police to investigate then recall them for further questioning weeks or even months later			1
the ruling also undermines key public protections such as requiring alleged offenders to hand over their passports , or demanding they stay away from schools or victims			2
yesterday home secretary @entity42 branded the ruling ‘ flat wrong ’			2
pledging to introduce laws to reverse it , she said : ‘ this judgment could have a serious impact on the vital work the police do to keep us all safe			1
’ the @entity20 story exposing the scandal @entity54 boss sir @entity53 said he feared the crisis could saddle taxpayers with a massive compensation bill			0
senior officers estimate more than 85,000 people are on bail at any one time and many will have been bailed beyond the 96 - hour limit			1
there are 14,029 on bail in @entity65 alone , including 175 suspected of murder or attempted murder			2
sir @entity53 said : ‘ the ruling overturns 25 years of police interpretation and application of the @entity72			1
we are very , very concerned			0
‘ we have been advised by two qcs that this is a serious situation that needs primary legislation to get us out of it			2
' we are putting into place categorisation plans , profiling the most serious offences when people are on bail			2
we are in new territory here			0
’ fury : sir @entity84 , chief constable of @entity85 , left , said they were ' on the verge of disaster ' following the @entity90 decision upheld by mr @entity91 , right , in the @entity92 asked about potential compensation claims , sir @entity53 said : ‘ you would expect me to assess the implications but it is not my intention to alert people to this latest ruling to behave improperly			1
the implications are serious for ongoing cases and historic cases			0
’ experts said defendants could use @entity105 of the @entity106 – which protects against infringement of liberty – to make a compensation claim			0
it is already used by prisoners to claim more than £ 100 a day if they are kept in prison beyond their parole date			0
@entity115 mp @entity114 said : ‘ this is an urgent situation that clearly the government understands has to be addressed			0
first to make sure that the criminal justice system does n’t go into meltdown , but also that ensures the floodgates are n’t opened to a string of compensation claims			0
concerned : home secretary @entity42 said @entity117 was looking to appeal the decision which could have huge ramifications for the criminal justice system in a statement to the @entity128 , policing minister @entity3 said emergency legislation will be introduced within days to ensure police were not forced to operate with ‘ one hand tied behind their back ’			1
he insisted ministers were not alerted to the ruling until this week			2
yesterday the @entity137 agreed to emergency sessions to examine the case next month , but it is likely the law will be changed before mps go on holiday on july 19			1
the decision does not apply to terror suspects , who can not be bailed			1
under separate counter-terror legislation , alleged terrorists can be held for a maximum of 14 days before they must be charged			2
until this year the maximum detention period was 28 days			0
on april 5 at @entity151 , district judge @entity150 rewrote the rule book			0
refusing to extend custody time for a murder suspect , he ruled that the detention clock continues to run while the suspect is on bail from the police station			1
@entity159 , 47 , had been arrested over a ferocious attack on @entity161 , 52 , who lived alone			0
he was first held last november for 28 hours and then released on bail			0
police applied to the court to extend the period of detention from 36 hours to the maximum allowed of 96 hours			1
the ruling was made despite @entity159 ’s solicitor not opposing the extension			0
court papers suggest the judge initially decided the police ’s case was ‘ justified ’ before changing his mind on the advice of his court clerk			0
@entity159 has not been charged and will remain free unless new evidence emerges in the case			0
@entity179 applied to the @entity92 for a judicial review but last month mr @entity91 upheld the decision and refused leave to appeal .			1

emergency law to reverse shock bail ruling , minister tells mps
call for legislation which affects *80,000* suspects
police force given *permission* to appeal ' bizarre ' bail decision to the @entity137
@entity196 *'s* ruling means clock will be *ticking* on a 96 - hour limit to bring charges as soon as person is arrested
