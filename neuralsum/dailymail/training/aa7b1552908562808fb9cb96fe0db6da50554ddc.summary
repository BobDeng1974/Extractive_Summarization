7,000 of the 10,000 women diagnosed per year with @entity2 - positive breast cancer do not respond well to @entity3 , the standard medicine a breakthrough by scientists could lead to a new treatment for one of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer			1
they have pinpointed the molecule which causes cancerous cells to grow and spread very quickly , making them hard to treat			0
now that researchers have found the specific molecule , they are confident they can use an existing drug to stop the cancer in its tracks			2
the discovery offers hope for women diagnosed with @entity2 - positive breast cancer , which tends to spread far more quickly than other types			1
it affects 10,000 women a year – a fifth of all cases – and of these around 7,000 do not respond well to the current standard treatment , a medicine called @entity3			1
researchers from the @entity32 at @entity33 conducted the study			0
they hope that in future women could have tumour biopsies to check for the presence of the molecule			0
if found , they would be offered the existing drug – which is mainly only used in trials – alongside @entity3			2
early studies on mice have shown that the combination of these two treatments eradicates the tumours			0
around 50,000 women develop breast cancer a year and it causes just under 12,000 deaths.but although survival rates have improved in recent decades , campaigners are concerned they still lag far behind those of other @entity52 countries			1
they are particularly worried that there are so few treatments available for those women with the most aggressive forms of breast cancer			1
its chief executive , @entity60 , said : ‘ despite great advances in the past 20 years , five - year breast cancer survival in the @entity62 is worse than the @entity52 average			1
‘ breast cancer is not a done deal and much more must be done to improve survival rates			2
' there is a desperate need for drugs which work in new ways to give the thousands of women diagnosed with @entity2 - positive breast cancer the best possible chances of surviving the disease			1
‘ this study could pave the way for new treatments and bring us closer to our goal of preventing half of the deaths from breast cancer by 2025 , through improved and personalised treatments			2
’ researchers from the @entity32 at @entity33 , who conducted the survey , hope in the future that women could have tumour biopsies to check for the presence of the molecule ( stock pic ) the research , published in the @entity95 , looked at tumour samples provided by 2,000 women with breast cancer			1
about 40 per cent of them were found to contain this molecule – known as αvβ6			0
in further experiments on mice , they used another treatment called @entity105 to target this molecule and found it completely eradicated the tumours			0
they will now carry out trials on women to test how well this treatment works alongside @entity3			0
if successful , it is hoped the treatment would be routinely available within the next ten years			0
dr @entity114 , from @entity33 , who led the study said : ‘ high αvβ6 levels could be tested for in routine biopsies to identify which women are at a high risk of metastasis , ( cancer spreading ) , ensuring these women can receive personalised treatment , improving their chances of survival			0

10,000 women per year diagnosed with the @entity2 - positive breast cancer
but 7,000 do not respond well to @entity3 , the medicine used for treatment
experts say new drug could be developed now molecule has been found
