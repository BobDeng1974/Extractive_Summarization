‘ the absence of an independent medical examination remains a concern			0
we continue to press for evidence of a full , impartial and independent investigation			0
’ the human rights charity @entity40 said the charges should have been dropped and the men - who went on trial in february - should be released because of the torture allegations			2
the three men , who are charged with possessing , taking and intending to distribute illegal drugs , were arrested on holiday in august after police said they found a quantity of synthetic cannabis known as “ spice ” in their car			2

there have been allegations of torture , including electric shock and beatings , from the police in @entity5 ( pictured ) she said : ‘ they were taken back to their hotel room , they were beaten in their hotel room , it does appear they were separated from each other and each taken to a different room			2
