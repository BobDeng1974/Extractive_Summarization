@entity1 should brace themselves for interest in their players from top - flight clubs following their run to the @entity7 quarter - finals , manager @entity0 has said			1
@entity8 were eliminated from the competition on wednesday night by @entity11 ' @entity10 , who booked a semi-final date at @entity14 at the second time of asking thanks to @entity18 's angled 70th - minute finish in an @entity20 replay			1
it ended a memorable @entity7 journey for rovers that had included resounding home victories over @entity26 sides @entity25 and @entity27 in previous rounds			2
@entity1 manager @entity0 believes the club should brace themselves for interest in their players the manner in which they dispatched those two , coupled with the fact they frustrated @entity10 for the majority of the 180 minutes , is unlikely to have gone unnoticed by bigger clubs plotting their summer spending			1
@entity0 is no stranger to staving off interest in his prized assets , having rejected advances for @entity42 and @entity43 in the past two transfer windows , and the @entity8 boss expects overtures for more of his men in a few months ' time			1
' what the players have done is they 've put themselves on a platform and shown that they can play in the @entity26 , ' he said			0
' they 've got to maintain that over the next six games and show the @entity26 big boys			0
that 's obviously the nature of the game that we 're in , i 'm not going to kid myself			0
' it 's the nature of business			0
if you look at all the clubs now , everybody sells			0
@entity10 sold ( @entity66 ) @entity65 in the summer			2
' you 've seen over the two games against @entity10 and in previous games against @entity25 and @entity27 that we 've got some very good young players			1
they 're developing , they 're growing and getting some real experience under their belts			0
' @entity1 strikers @entity42 and @entity43 have both attrackted in the last two transfer windows @entity1 's owners @entity79 's have previously adopted a strong stance on possible outgoings , telling @entity83 and @entity84 that @entity42 and @entity43 would be remaining in east @entity85			1
however , that position may have to soften if rovers are to bring their mounting debts down as they look to adhere to the @entity89 regulations			0
their recent failure to do so caused the @entity93 to place them under a transfer embargo which @entity0 knows has left him restricted when injuries have hit			2
' you always want to keep your players and we want to be in a position to add to it , ' he added			0
' we 've got to try and do as much as we can with this embargo			0
the embargo 's just caught up with us because we have n't been able to bring enough bodies in			0
' @entity0 shakes hands with @entity10 manager @entity11 ahead of wednesday 's @entity7 replay indeed , @entity0 's options are so stretched at the minute that he joked he is considering starting goalkeeper @entity106 in attack against @entity108 this saturday			1
the stopper almost produced a moment for the @entity7 annals on wednesday when , after coming up for a @entity113 long throw , his swivel and shot deep into stoppage time almost beat @entity116 in the @entity10 goal			1
' we sent @entity119 up , more in hope than anything , we did n't know he had that football ability in him to turn and hit it on the spin , ' @entity0 admitted			2
' he 's put himself forward for centre forward on saturday ! ' goalkeeper @entity106 almost scored a late equaliser beyond @entity10 goalkeeper @entity116			1

@entity1 's @entity42 and @entity43 have both attracted interest
@entity0 believes players will attract attention after @entity7 *exploits*
@entity1 lost 1 - 0 to @entity10 on wednesday in quarter - final replay
