by @entity1 reporter published : 08:40 est , 22 april 2013 updated : 08:40 est , 22 april 2013 @entity3 's plummeting murder rate may have increased the average life expectancy for residents of the @entity6 has risen , and the @entity7 is crediting it to their controversial stop - and - frisk policy			1
the life expectancy of @entity3 was listed at 81 in 2010 compared to 78 a decade ago , according to a report from the city 's @entity11			1
there are other reasons for the increased longevity besides less crime			1
the report credits two - thirds of the boost in life expectancy to a reduction in heart disease and cancer rates			1
law enforcement advocates claim @entity3 's controversial stop - and - frisk policy has worked so well it 's raised the life expectancy for @entity3 it also attributes 11 per cent of the increase to better treatment for residents living with @entity30			1
however , the report agrees that the murder rate 's decline is contributing as much as 2 per cent to the change			1
last year there were 419 homicides in @entity3 , compared to 536 in 2010 and 673 in 2000			1
the city 's overall death rate dropped from 7.4 per cent in 2002 , which saw the deaths of 59,651 people , to 6.4 per cent in 2010 , when 52,575 people died			1
while every ethnic group benefits from the bump , the greatest increase is among the city 's black residents , who got another 3.8 years			2
whites were given 3.2 years more while @entity48 were given an extra 2.2 years			2
the murder rate for blacks is highest among ethnic groups at 16.8 per 100,000			1
those figures are triple that of @entity48 and eight times the rate among whites			1
when asked about the connection between the homicide rate and increased life spans by the @entity60 , @entity11 spokesman @entity56 agreed that one had affected the other			1
' yes , it has , ' he said			2
a health department report indicated the lowered homicide rate was responsible for 2 per cent of the boom in longevity law - enforcement called the numbers a special case			1
normally life - span increases are due to medical advances â€” not law - enforcement advances , ' said @entity77 chairman @entity76 the stop - and - frisk policy has been under fire recently , with critics claiming it is simply a tool for the city 's police to target and harass minorities			2
the @entity7 is in the midst of fighting a federal class - action lawsuit from the @entity87 alleging the the practice of stopping a person who an officer suspects has committed a crime , is committing a crime or is about to commit one , is unconstitutional			2
the @entity94 alleged that while black and @entity48 men ages 14 to 24 make up only 4.7 per cent of the city 's population , they accounted for 41 per cent of stop - and - frisk cases in 2011			2
in testimony earlier this month , former @entity7 chief @entity100 said no resident had ever criticized the program , the @entity99 reported			0
' i do n't get a complaint from a civilian , ' he said			0
' i 've heard it from @entity109 's group			0
' but an audio recording made public as part of the suit revealed a commanding officer ordering cops to stop ' male blacks			0
' the recording was made in secret in february by officer @entity118 in the 40th precinct station house in the @entity120 and played for jurors			0
@entity118 captured a heated argument with his commanding officer , deputy inspector @entity123			0
in audio released during a jury trial , a commanding @entity7 officer can be heard demanding that ' black males ' be subjected to stop - and - frisks as they 're the ones ' causing trouble ' in the tape , @entity123 lambasts @entity118 for not stopping enough people and insists that he has a duty to prevent violent crime by frisking ' the right people at the right time , the right location			0
' after being pressed as to who the ' right people ' were , @entity123 explained that they were the ones causing the most problems , @entity136 reports			0
finally , he specifies exactly who he means			0
' the problem was , what , male blacks			0
and i told you at roll call , and i have no problem telling you this , male blacks 14 to 20 , 21 , ' @entity123 can be heard to say on the tape			0
since @entity148 took office the number of people subjected to stop - and - frisks has increased more than five times over			0
531,000 were stopped - and - frisked last year .			0

@entity3 life expectancy up to 81 in 2010 compared to 78 a decade ago
@entity11 agrees lowered homicide rate is partly responsible
