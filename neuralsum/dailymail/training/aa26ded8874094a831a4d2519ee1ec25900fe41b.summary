the @entity1 season finished in @entity2 on sunday , but it appears the hard work may have just begun for @entity4 and @entity5			1
before the pair begun competing in the season - finale @entity7 , race to @entity2 winner and world no 1 @entity4 uploaded an image of him lifting a huge weight			1

both players finished tied second , two shots behind winner @entity36 , another member of the victorious @entity16 team at @entity48			2
but @entity4 collected the enourmous race to @entity2 trophy at the end of the tournament , and would have needed all the strength gained from his intense workouts as he held it for the cameras .			0

@entity4 has been posting pictures of himself hard at work in gym
@entity5 mocked @entity4 on @entity30 with images of his own workout
both men finished tied second at the @entity7 in @entity2
