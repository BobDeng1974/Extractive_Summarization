@entity1 striker @entity0 insists there will be no more fireworks off the pitch - and says that anyone who thinks he has sex just before a match is having a laugh			1
the @entity10 striker is more famous for his off - field antics than his exploits on the pitch , and the most notorious incident was when fireworks were let off in his bathroom			1
@entity0 said : ' i have done mistakes in the past , like everybody did when they were young			1
@entity0 prepares to fly out to @entity21 with @entity1 - and a fan sporting the same haircut stands behind @entity0 with former girlfriend @entity24 in @entity25 earlier this year @entity0 admits he needs to improve his goalscoring record of one goal in eight @entity1 appearances @entity0 was speaking in an exclusive interview with @entity30 ' and the firework thing did happen , but it was n't me who let it off			1
i know @entity36 is like this , though , so it 's ok			2
it 's a shame , sure , but i get used to it – the newspapers are always trying to give an image of @entity0 that is bad , printing things that are n't true			1
' off the pitch , really i do n't have any problems because i am always home			2
when people speak bad about me , it 's only because they listen to the media and read what the newspapers say			2
they maybe lose a little bit of focus on my football , so everybody thinks i am famous for what happens outside the pitch			2
' the 24 - year - old also said rumours of him having sex just before a match were unfounded - and that he is only interested in scoring on the pitch			1
he told @entity30 : ' someone told me recently that i had apparently said that if i have sex three or four hours before a game , it is working for me on the pitch			1
trust me , if i am having sex four hours before a game i am not able to play			1
i do n't think anyone could			2
it makes me laugh , but this is not me			2
' i am only focused on football			0
i live out in the countryside , i am relaxed and i just hope the time that i 'm going to score is coming soon			2
then maybe they will concentrate more on football and not all the other bull * * * *			0
' to that end , @entity0 believes @entity80 's strength of character can help him make a success of his @entity1 career			1
the @entity10 international said he was surprised by the quality in @entity1 's squad when he signed and has admitted that he is desperate to score his first @entity88 goal for the club			1
the striker has had the international break to focus solely on his club form after being dropped by the new @entity10 head coach , @entity93 , and says he is determined to repay the faith shown to him by the @entity1 supporters			1
@entity0 ( second left ) scored @entity1 's opener in their 2 - 1 @entity98 win against @entity99 @entity100 ( right ) is expected to feature alongside @entity0 against @entity101 after returning from a thigh injury asked about playing under @entity80 , @entity0 said : ' he is very good , a strong character , and i think that comes out in the way the team plays			1
' i think he can help me improve as a player			0
he is very open , everybody can talk to him , but first he looks at the person , and second he looks at the footballer			0
with @entity80 , you need to be a good person – you do n't have to be , how do you say it , a d * * * head			1
' i need to get in the box more			0
i do n't do it enough , but it is something i am working to try to do more			2
i have never been a real , out - and - out striker – i have always been someone who goes around the pitch , you know ? ' if it was my choice , i would always go with two strikers			2
it 's the way i like to play , but @entity80 asked me to play as the first striker			1
i understand that when the ball comes from wide on the left or right , i need to be in the box otherwise there might be no - one there at all			0
' i can see already that the @entity1 fans really like me , although i know that maybe they are a little upset because i do n't score			1
i see they appreciate that i am working hard , though , which is nice for me			0
' @entity0 added : ' i did n't really know much about the club before coming here , but i 've been really surprised			1
' i knew they were a very good team , but i did n't know they were as good as they are			2
of course we need to improve many things because we have started off not very good , but i think the players here are amazing			0
' @entity1 captain @entity145 ( left ) has been compared to @entity147 midfielder @entity146 by @entity0 @entity0 said his current objective is to break his @entity88 duck			1
' i can see already that the @entity1 fans really like me , although i know that maybe they are a little upset because i do n't score			1
' i see they appreciate that i am working hard , though , which is nice for me			0
i know i have one goal in the @entity98 , but in the @entity88 i have to start with one			0
after that , i might set myself a target , but i swear – right now my first league goal is my first and only objective			0
' i need to get in the box more			0
i do n't do it enough , but it is something i am working to try to do more			2

i had really not seen much of him before this season , apart from for @entity36 , but wow			0
i think of him as being at the same level as @entity146			0
@entity0 posted an @entity178 picture of himself in a shark hoodie on wednesday ' vision , technique , but he is powerful as well			1
it 's going to be very difficult for the team to find another player like him in the future			0
' @entity0 is settling on @entity188 but misses his pet dogs who are back home in @entity10 ; a labrador - pitbull cross @entity193 , who lives in with the star 's foster parents and his other dog , a rottweiler called @entity199 , he said : ' if i say kiss , then she kisses me			1
' of course i miss my family and friends in @entity10			1
but when i go back , i spend hours talking with my parents			2
then i visit my friends and we do normal stuff – you know , playing @entity210 and ping pong			0
then i pick up my dogs and we go for a walk			0
' they are really clever , my dogs			0
@entity193 is unbelievable – when you look into her face , it is like you are with a real person			0
when i speak , she listens			0
i only have to say things one time			0
if i ask her for her paw , she gives it to me			0
i ask her to sit , she sits ; i say she can run , she runs			0
everything i ask her to do , she does			0
' @entity0 with his dog @entity193 , who lives with the star 's foster parents in @entity10 @entity229 @entity1 must make @entity0 behave - @entity230			1
