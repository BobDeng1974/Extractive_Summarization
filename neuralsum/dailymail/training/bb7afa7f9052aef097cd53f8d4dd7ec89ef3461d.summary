with shows like @entity3 's @entity2 and @entity4 dominating saturday night tv , you 'd be forgiven for thinking we were a nation of crooners			0
but not in @entity9 - where a band has axed carols from its @entity13 church show because people are ' too embarrassed to sing in public '			1
the 50 - piece @entity15 scrapped the tunes after audience members felt ' press - ganged ' last year into singing o come all @entity19 and @entity20 ! the @entity21			1
all is calm : @entity15 ( pictured ) has axed carols from its @entity13 show - because people do n't like public singing			1
member @entity26 said : ' we want people to feel less press - ganged ' instead , the award - winning group 's @entity13 concert will feature two hours of its trumpets , bassoons and trombones with no call for the 160 - strong audience to take part			1
@entity26 , who plays tuba and arranges the concerts , took the decision after an online survey last year found only 40 per cent of attendees wanted the carols again			1
' we used to play at carol services and when we played our concert last year we pretty much stuck to the same formula , ' the 43 - year - old software developer said			0
' people did n't seem to be that enthusiastic about the singing so i thought , let 's try dropping the audience carols			2
' we 'll still be playing a short medley of @entity13 songs and people are more than welcome to sing from their seats , but it 's not at all like last year			0
' we want people to feel more relaxed and feel less threatened and press - ganged into singing			1
repertoire : instead the concert will include instrumental versions of songs such as @entity60 by the @entity15 ( pictured ) , which began in 1919 and has around 50 players he added : ' it seems it 's been quite a talking point locally			1
we were joking about whether we 'd have protesters singing carols outside			0
' the concert will be held on december 13 on @entity9 's @entity69 and stars the 95 - year - old wind and brass ensemble , which has won several prizes			0
the band won gold awards at the 2008 and 2010 @entity75 and this year took the platinum award at a regional competition			0
its move was announced on the band 's website , where musical director @entity81 wrote : ' we will not be short - changing our audience			2
they 'll still get two hours of top entertainment			0
' save the date : the strictly carol - singing - free concert is planned for @entity9 's @entity69 this year 's repertoire will still include some @entity13 favourites - including @entity91 ' fairytale of @entity92 and @entity94 theme @entity93 - but there will be no forced singing along			1
less obvious pieces include @entity97 and @entity98 , a 1950s dance by @entity100			0
mr @entity26 said on the website : ' i can understand that a lot people do not enjoy singing in public , even with such a great band accompanying them			0
' with the feedback we 've had from our survey we thought we 'd drop carols from the concert altogether , which leaves room for other popular music for our audience to listen to			2
' if people want to sing carols they 're better off going to a carol service			2

decision taken by award - winning 50 - piece @entity15
it surveyed audience members and found carols were the least popular
instead its church show will include tunes by @entity128 and @entity91
manager : ' we want people to feel less threatened and press - ganged '
