by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity1 has warned that @entity2 are prepared to cheat their way to victory when they face @entity5 at the @entity6			1
the teams meet on june 19 in their second match of the tournament in what could be a make - or - break game for @entity13 ’s side			2
but @entity15 boss and former @entity16 international @entity1 says the @entity17 will do anything to beat @entity5 - even repeating the @entity20 handball that knocked @entity21 out of the 2010 @entity6 quarter - final			1
cheat to victory ? @entity1 claims @entity2 will do anything to beat @entity5 at the @entity6 handball referee ! @entity2 frontman @entity20 was sent off for stopping a @entity21 effort on goal with his hands during the quarter - finals of the 2010 @entity6 according to @entity1 this unscrupulous streak – drummed into them from birth – is inherent in the national culture			1
just ask @entity21 – that ’s how they went out of the last @entity6 in 2010			1
their quarter - final in @entity38 was tied at 1 - 1 and into extra time but @entity41 ’s header in the dying minutes beat @entity2 goalkeeper @entity42 and was going in			1
until @entity20 flung his hand at the ball and pushed it out			1
it was an instinctive reflex , bred through generations			2
the @entity48 striker was sent off , but then @entity49 missed the resulting penalty and @entity2 went through in the shootout			1
@entity1 , who won 26 caps for @entity2 said : ‘ what i ’m going to say is something very , very normal for me and i hope you take it well , ’ he says			1
' i know that for you a handball on the goal line is cheating			1
it ’s part of the game			2
‘ like if i ’m the last man and you ’re running and i pull your shirt and you go down and i get sent off – is that cheating ? no it ’s not cheating			0
‘ you guys take it as a last man red card , fine			0
we take the same reaction [ for what @entity20 did ]			1
‘ i know it was massive in @entity5 , i know			1
but @entity5 ’s reaction came as a surprise for us			1
‘ we thought , “ why ? ” @entity20 had saved it			1
it ’s worse for us when you do something that no - one sees , like punching someone			0
but a handball on the goal - line is a handball on the goal - line			1
’ onto the next round : @entity20 and his @entity2 team - mates celebrate despite the striker 's sending off @entity88 have told the referee , “ it ’s a handball so send me off ? ” @entity1 dismisses the idea as unthinkable			1
‘ no we do n’t do that , ’ he adds			0
‘ we try to hide , but everyone saw it			0
’ it can all be explained by ‘ garra charrua , ’ which runs through the very heart and soul of @entity2			1
in the literal translation ‘ garra ’ means ‘ claw ’ and ‘ charrua ’ is the term for native @entity102 in the country			2
the most natural translation is a fighting spirit			0
all @entity17 nations say they have ‘ garra , ’ but in @entity2 they consider ‘ garra charrua ’ as their national trademark			1
@entity1 adds : ‘ we wo n’t accept that you are better than us , i wo n’t accept that you are better than me			1
‘ if you appear better than me , i will find a way , with my players around , to stop you			0
‘ if i accept you ’re better than me , then i lose			0
so i wo n’t accept it			0
how can i ? ‘ we tell each other when we ’re playing : are you helping me here ? are you covering me ? are you stopping them playing ? ‘ we ’re sticking the opposition a little bit , grabbing them , being stronger than them			0
whatever it is , to stop you , to win the game			0
yeah we do that , and we are proud of that			0
international : @entity1 , pictured challenging @entity5 's @entity126 , won 26 caps for his country ‘ i think that ’s a way you win more than you lose			1
if you just go to the game and you play the game and if you are worse you lose – that means you did n’t want to win as much as i did			0
‘ do you want to win the game of football more than me ? you ’ve got no chance			0
because i will do more than you to win			0
’ @entity1 played with @entity137 for the national side in the 1990s , perhaps the epitome of that ‘ win - at - all - costs ’ concept			2
the defender was ruthless on the field			0
a horror for opposition players to face			0
@entity1 considers that they took ‘ garra charrua ’ too far back then , incessantly urged to batter opponents			2
‘ i hated it when i was playing with the national team and when we were playing they were expecting a horrible team , kicking everyone , ’ he recalls			0
‘ but it was a pleasure to have @entity137 in my team			0
just as long as he was n’t against me			0
’ it is instilled in children as young as six in @entity2 , this insatiable lust for victory overpowering any sense of morality or justice			1
football is a way of life over there and they care little for other sports			0
tough guy : @entity137 was ruthless on the field and @entity1 says it was a pleasure to play alongside him the clash of cultures is stark			2
in @entity5 youngsters are taught to play for fun			2
in @entity2 youngsters are ordered to win			2
‘ you know the discussion going on all over the world that you can not make kids of seven or eight play to win because they need to enjoy the game ? in @entity2 you need to win at six , ’ @entity1 says bluntly , not that he necessarily agrees with this			1
‘ it is a way of living and learning , ’ he insists , speaking at the launch of @entity188 ’s coverage of the @entity6 in @entity189 this summer			2
‘ players have to win games at a very early age			0
‘ i tried to change that			0
i went to @entity2 for two years and was the chairman of a big organisation of children from five to 13 and i tried to convince them to slow down and not be so crazy about winning			2
it is not in our culture			0
’ are @entity5 too nice ? there is not a moment ’s hesitation to @entity1 ’s reply : ‘ yes			1
’ is the @entity16 mentality cheating ? is it wrong ? if @entity20 is sent off for stopping @entity5 scoring with a handball on the line that expels us from this summer ’s tournament , he ’ll soon find out .			1
