by @entity0 published : 14:28 est , 15 november 2012 updated : 06:01 est , 16 november 2012 @entity2 's first infestation of a the deadly @entity4 spider has been discovered in a machinery plant in @entity6			1
engineers at the plant discovered the notoriously viscous spider and after a @entity11 search to identify it called in pest control			1
factory workers and office assistants were evacuated by pest control officers as the spider was sealed in an air tight container			1
a nest of eggs was later discovered in the same crate where the spider was originally found after more than 100 baby @entity22 hatched from a small sack the size of a pea			1
'' we cordoned off the area in the yard where the spider was discovered and created a ring of insecticide around it			0
we then used ele4ctric and petrol based foggers on the rest of the site			0
' after the factory was closed last night we then sprayed the office areas with a water - based insecticide as well			2
' we are now satisfied that the premises is safe			0
' it is believed that the spiders had come into the country from a delivery of imported machinery goods from @entity70			1
all products are fumigated before being exported but it remains a mystery as to how the spiders survived			0
mr @entity45 believes that @entity22 can survive up to some weeks after only one large meal so it is not unlikely that they would survive during transit			1
@entity4 spiders are considered the most venomous spiders in @entity81			2
the southern @entity4 has the shiny , black , globular abdomen with the distinctive red hourglass on the underside			2
' as far as we know this is the first time @entity22 have been found in the @entity2 though there have been some cases of hoaxes , ' mr @entity45 added			1
a plan was implemented that included tracking down where antivenom is located in the @entity2 , which turned out to be just two hospitals , in @entity94 and @entity95			2
however , no bites had been reported			0
the local @entity98 hospital was notified and medical advice was given should anyone receive a bite			0
@entity102 ( left ) and @entity45 ( right ) , the pest control officers who trapped the @entity4 in an airtight container @entity106 of @entity107 said : ' it was down to the fast reaction of the company who called us to deal with the problem that brought this issue safely under control			1
' @entity22 are very notorious spiders identified by the coloured , hourglass - shaped mark on their abdomens			2
' this spider 's bite is much feared because its venom is reported to be 15 times stronger than a rattlesnake 's			1
' in humans bites produce muscle aches , nausea , and a paralysis of the diaphragm that can make breathing difficult			0
' however , contrary to popular belief , most people who are bitten suffer no serious damage			0
' we have been called out for snakes , scorpions and spiders before but never in the past 24 years for one of these deadly creatures			0
' @entity141 , @entity140 has been notified about the case , however @entity107 have now frozen the spiders to eliminate any danger .			0
