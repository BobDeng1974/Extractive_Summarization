2 ) everywhere is too far away from everywhere else			2
3 ) nothing good on television			2

but in an attempt to boost the spirits of everyone @entity69 in the face of an unstoppable swelling of @entity1 pride , the paper has listed 10 points that it says are worth reminding @entity1 about			0
for a start , there is the weather , with cricket officials at @entity79 , where the first of the @entity13 is being played , looking at the skies and wondering just when rain will stop play			1
then there is the @entity86 beer , bitter and lager , the bitter being bitter and warm , the lager tasting like gnat 's p * * s. as for @entity1 beaches , well , says they website , they are ' mostly armoured with pebbles or cobble stones as opposed to sand , necessitating deck chairs and barring long walks or lazing about on a towel			1
and the water is freezing			0
' @entity1 food is also under attack , with chicken tikka masala taking over from fish and chips , with one @entity86 food critic describing the meal as ' the culinary equivalent of @entity110			1
' holidays ? when they go overseas , @entity1 tend to cluster in enclaves , says the paper , where they eat @entity1 food and avoid interaction with foreigners , apart from the waiters			1
@entity44 's @entity117 celebrates after bowling @entity0 's @entity118 during the first @entity13 cricket test match between @entity44 and @entity0			0
the paper has listed 10 points that it says are worth reminding @entity1 about to stave off boasting next there 's the huge cost of paying for transport to get from @entity124 to @entity125 to fly on to , say , @entity126 , followed by at least three hours to get through customs , security and then allowing for flight delays			0
there 's also the question of @entity1 happiness - while @entity0 is in the top five in a recent survey , @entity1 came in as the 10th happiest nation among developed economies			0
and of course , @entity1 is a nation divided			0
the paper says that the north and south of @entity44 hate each other , the @entity142 hate the @entity86 , the @entity143 hate the @entity86 , the @entity86 hate everyone and everyone hates the @entity143			1
the paper also critcises the @entity86 beer , bitter and lager , claiming the bitter is bitter and warm , the lager tasting like gnat 's p * * s. but @entity0 beers are also often crticised for being tasteless and weak it claims when @entity1 go overseas , they tend to cluster in enclaves , eat @entity1 food and avoid interaction with foreigners			1
the same could be said for the high number of @entity0 who congregate in @entity0 themed bars on the economic and job front , says the paper , the @entity1 's economy is ' basically down the toilet			0
do n't let a @entity165 fool you with stories about the greatness of the @entity86 pound			1
' unemployment in @entity0 is at 5.7 per cent , while in @entity1 it 's 7.9 per cent			0
finally , there 's those sporting wins			0
the paper says it should be pointed out to all @entity1 rugby bores that the @entity18 side is a composite team of @entity1 and @entity178 players			1
' and if the @entity179 win the cricket , remind them who @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity181 are			0

@entity188 also criticises @entity86 beaches , beers and food
the weather is also *mocked* as is the nations *general* state of ' *misery* '
