holster those guns and put down those pitchforks because a chemist has come up with a surprising way that you could help you survive a zombie apocalypse			0
using a combination of three terrifyingly disgusting smells , an expert believes she can create ‘ @entity9 ’ that mimics the smell of rotting human flesh			2
while many people may prefer to stick to floral perfume and musky cologne for the time being , the scientist thinks that it could be used to dupe zombies into believing a wearer is dead – should the highly improbably night of the living dead occur			2
dead smelly : using a combination of three terrifyingly disgusting smells , a chemist believes she can create ' death cologne ' ( imaginary advertisement pictured ) that mimics the smell of rotting human flesh to fool zombies it features just three chemical compounds			1
@entity29 and cadaverine are the main ingredients , which are emitted early on in the decaying process			2
both organic chemical compound are produced by the breakdown of amino acids in living and dead organisms and are toxic in large doses			2
they are largely responsible for the foul odour of putrefying flesh , but also contribute to bad breath and can be found in semen			0
@entity44 , which smells like rotten eggs is also added to the ' perfume ' to create its offensive bouquet			1
dr @entity49 of @entity50 in @entity51 says that the zombie - repellent or ‘ death cologne ’ can be made using just three chemicals – and that a little would go a very long way			1
she explains the vile concoction is primarily a mixture of two ‘ perfectly named ’ putrid chemical compounds called putrescine and cadaverine , which are emitted early on in the decaying process			1
‘ but maybe if you want to really round off the smell of death for the cologne , we should add in methanethiol			0
‘ it ’s got that rotten egg , boiled cabbage smell , ’ she said in a video for the @entity69			0
smells rotten : the vile ' death cologne'concoction is primarily a mixture of two putrid chemical compounds called putrescine and cadaverine , which are emitted early on in the human decaying process the idea is that a spritz of the pungent perfume would make you smell like a corpse and not be of any interest to a hungry zombie trying to sniff out fresh meat to gnaw upon			1
‘ this cologne is an evasive method , which when coupled with zombie mannerisms - as seen in “ @entity91 ” or “ @entity92 ” - would be effective in avoiding a zombie attack when moving among a zombie horde			0
‘ one could also wear it when casually waiting out the zombie apocalypse so as not to attract the attention of a roaming horde of zombies , ’ she told @entity96			0
dr @entity49 has been working on death cologne for three years and said in the video : ‘ if we ’re really trying to mimic a corpse we have got to get the smell down to perfection			1
fresh meat : the idea is that a spritz of the pungent perfume would make you smell like a corpse and not be of any interest to a hungry zombie ( illustrated ) trying to sniff out fresh meat to gnaw upon ‘ nobody wants to be the guinea pig that spritzes on the death cologne and realises it does n’t quite work			0
’ for people worried about how easy it would be to produce vast quantities of the stench in a bid to protect the population of @entity126 , dr @entity49 said remarkably little would be needed as it is ‘ incredibly stinky in very low quantities			1
’ she explained that modified @entity130 bacteria could be used to make all the polyamines ( an organic compound with two or more amino groups ) needed to produce the scent .			0

dr @entity49 of @entity50 in @entity51 says that the zombie - repellent can be made using just three chemical compounds
the vile concoction is primarily a mixture of putrescine and cadaverine , which are emitted by the body in the early stages of decay
@entity44 - which smells like rotting eggs - is also a component in the perfume which would be used to fool zombies that a living person is dead
