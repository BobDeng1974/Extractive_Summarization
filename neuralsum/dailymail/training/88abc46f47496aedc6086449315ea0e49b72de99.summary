by @entity0 published : 20:34 est , 18 january 2013 updated : 20:36 est , 18 january 2013 @entity2 's star : @entity3 is seen at the opening of a new @entity5 in @entity6 in 2004 they grew him a wild flower meadow in the desert where he and @entity10 could frolic hand - in - hand			1
they salute him and call him ‘ sir ’			2
and when he needed a new woman in his life , they ‘ auditioned ’ dozens of actresses for the role			2
the extraordinary lengths to which the @entity5 has allegedly gone to woo @entity3 are detailed in a controversial new book which contrasts his demi - god status in the organisation with the miserable existence of its rank - and - file devotees			1
to outsiders , it has always seemed odd that the squeaky - clean @entity28 superstar has lavished praise on the ‘ church ’ as a force for good in the world , when a growing number of ex-members have portrayed it as a ruthless and exploitative cult that rules its brainwashed flock with a rod of iron			1
now a book by @entity42 - winning @entity41 writer @entity40 — published in the @entity41 yesterday — has painted a withering portrait of an organisation which has always seen celebrity endorsement as essential to its mystique			1
what better buffer against ridicule of a ‘ religion ’ based on sci - fi author and founder @entity52 ’s claims of alien invaders inhabiting our bodies than the approval of a few film stars , the book asks			1
in going @entity59 : @entity2 , @entity28 and @entity60 , @entity40 claims that @entity2 boss @entity61 succeeded in cultivating @entity3 as a spiritual leader of his movement after he became @entity28 ’s biggest star with films such as @entity66 and mission : impossible			1
@entity3 , in turn , willingly became the church ’s smiling public face , ploughing millions of dollars into its work and even attempting to lobby foreign leaders , including former pm @entity73 , to advance its dubious cause around the world			2
love life : the book claims @entity2 boss @entity61 went to extreme lengths to keep @entity3 and @entity10 happy when the pair were married before 50 - year - old @entity3 , @entity81 was the church ’s biggest star name			1
according to @entity40 , the @entity85 actor was terrified that if he broke with the church , it might use against him confessions he made about his sexuality during his scientology spiritual counselling sessions , called ‘ auditing ’			1
at the height of @entity81 ’s fame in the @entity95 , church bosses were reportedly ‘ desperately concerned their most valuable member would be revealed as gay ’			2
@entity99 — once @entity61 ’s second - in - command but now a leading critic of @entity2 — told @entity40 the church had worked hard to protect @entity81 ’s reputation and that there were many allegations that he claims the church helped to ‘ make go away ’			1
allegations : @entity40 's book on the @entity5 the church yesterday dismissed @entity40 ’s book as ‘ an error - filled , unsubstantiated , bigoted , anti-scientology book ’ , which relied on the accounts of a ‘ handful of angry , bitter individuals ’ who have left the church , adding that it contained more than 200 mistakes			1
@entity40 relates how a young @entity3 was introduced to @entity2 by his first wife , actress @entity119 , in 1986			1
but @entity121 ’ parents were disaffected @entity122 and , the book claims , @entity61 was determined to keep his famous new recruit away from them			1
with @entity3 smitten by @entity125 actress @entity10 , then 21 , @entity99 said he was sent to @entity121 ’ home with divorce papers and simply told her : ‘ “ this is the right thing to do for @entity0 , because he is going to do lots of good for @entity2			2
” that was the end of @entity119			2
’ @entity61 ’s determination to please @entity3 and @entity10 , whom he married in 1990 , is said to have run to ludicrous lengths			0
@entity133 is the church ’s heavily fortified secret hq in the @entity136 desert , where some 800 members of @entity138 — @entity2 ’s quasi-military ruling order — slave away for room , board and £ 15 a week			0
it has been claimed that some have n’t left the base for ten years			0
but it was here , inside the razor - wire fences that @entity147 built a special ‘ love bungalow ’ where the couple stayed during their visits			1
a rose garden was planted next to it and a tennis court built			0
when @entity61 heard the couple fantasised about running through a field of wild flowers , staff were ordered to plant a section of desert			0
the meadow never took hold in the parched earth , and when a mudslide ruined the bungalow , @entity40 claims that @entity61 was so furious he ordered the entire base to work 16 - hour days until it was restored to pristine condition			1
while everyone else lives in spartan conditions at @entity133 , @entity3 would be lavishly entertained in the @entity170 home , which boasts two chefs and where even the lightbulbs are polished once a month			0
not for @entity3 and other visiting celebrities the indignity of having to salute @entity147 ’s five beagles , as rank - and - file workers were ordered to do , according to going @entity59			1
these dogs , claims the book , wear blue vests and shoulder epaulettes denoting they hold the rank of @entity182 , thus out - ranking most human staff			1
@entity133 : @entity2 's desert base in @entity136 is believed to be home to some 800 members of @entity138 @entity61 once had the entire @entity133 staff line up at the gate and salute @entity3 on his arrival , says @entity40			1
nobody was allowed to speak to him unless spoken to			0
the rule was simple — keep the film star happy			0
as @entity40 wryly observes : ‘ @entity61 showed his understanding of how to cater to the sense of entitlement that comes with great stardom			1
’ former scientologists believe @entity61 was dazzled by @entity3 and his @entity28 lifestyle while the actor ‘ fell under the spell ’ of the short but forceful @entity147 ’s commanding personality			0
the church leader liked to boast @entity3 used him as the model for his gutsy naval officer hero in @entity205			0
' suspicious ' : @entity40 alleges that @entity61 feared @entity10 was supplanting the church in @entity3 's affections but @entity40 alleges that @entity61 — who became @entity3 ’s best friend — grew deeply suspicious of @entity10 , according to his deputy , @entity99			1
he believed that not only was the @entity125 actress supplanting the church in @entity3 ’s affections , encouraging him to neglect it , but that she was a ‘ gold digger ’ who faked an interest in @entity2 to please her husband			0
if they convinced @entity3 that @entity10 was a ‘ suppressive person ’ — church code for a toxic personality — @entity3 could be ‘ peeled ’ away from her , @entity99 told @entity40			1
when , in 2001 , @entity3 and @entity10 split up , @entity99 says @entity2 staff quietly worked to turn their two young adopted children against @entity10 , convincing them that she was a ‘ sociopath ’			0
the church and @entity147 have vehemently denied these claims several times in the @entity227 their split , @entity3 became more committed to @entity2			2
whenever @entity28 ’s biggest star travelled abroad , he would lobby politicians and diplomats to promote @entity2 , says @entity40			1
he is said to have repeatedly urged @entity232 to enlist @entity73 ’s help in getting the church charitable status in the @entity235			0
@entity99 said he heard one phone call in which @entity232 told @entity3 he would be better off contacting @entity238 as , being a lawyer , she would ‘ understand the details ’			0
perhaps the oddest — and surely most embarrassing — claim in the book is that of the church ’s obsession with finding @entity3 a mate			2
in 2007 , after he ended his three - year relationship with @entity247 ( regarded as too independent - minded by church bosses , apparently ) the star complained that nobody had been able to find him a new girlfriend			2
a grand hunt ensued as staff reportedly auditioned every young actress in @entity2 — about 100 in all			0
none were told why they were being interviewed , but all were asked what they thought of @entity3			0
split : the actor 's three year romance with @entity261 starlet @entity247 ended in 2007 an early candidate was @entity263 , a strikingly beautiful and well - educated @entity264			2
according to @entity40 , when @entity263 refused church demands to give up her scientologist boyfriend as part of an important ‘ human rights ’ project , she was shown evidence suggesting he had cheated on her			1
after undergoing extensive security checks , she was flown to @entity272 where she and her church handlers ran into @entity3 , seemingly by accident			0
lavish dates followed in @entity276 and at a @entity278 mountain resort			0
striking beauty : @entity235 - @entity280 actress @entity263 @entity263 said she later moved in with him , but the relationship ended abruptly when , during a dinner party , she could n’t understand what the fast - talking @entity61 was saying and several times asked him to repeat himself			2
the next day , @entity3 lost his temper with her for showing disrespect to their leader			0
@entity40 says that when miss @entity263 told a friend about the affair , she was punished by having to dig ditches and even scrub lavatories with a toothbrush — a claim the church denies			1
going @entity59 alleges that the search for a new mrs @entity298 then went beyond @entity122 — @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 were all invited to audition for what they believed was a role in the mission : impossible films when , in fact , they were being assessed as future wives			0
@entity3 , of course , eventually married actress @entity311 who helpfully had admitted to having a childhood crush on him			0
@entity40 says several sources have confirmed miss @entity263 ’s experiences with @entity3 , although the star insists no church executive ever set him up with girlfriends			1
by the mid- 2000s , @entity3 was the most powerful figure in the church after @entity61 , say ex-members			0
@entity61 ‘ convinced @entity3 that he and @entity0 were two of only a handful of truly “ big beings ” on the planet , ’ said @entity99			0
he added that @entity61 even told the actor that @entity52 was relying on them to make it to ‘ @entity326 ’ — an unspecified planet far , far away where they would meet up with @entity52 in the afterlife			0
@entity2 is going through a @entity333 crisis from which critics insist it will never recover			0
the church claims to have 8 million members worldwide , but a survey suggested there are only 25,000 in the @entity41 last year , @entity3 had to contend with the humiliation of @entity311 divorcing him , and reportedly insisting she does n’t want their daughter brought up as a scientologist			1
at least the world ’s most controversial church still has @entity3 as a figurehead			2
whether that is a blessing or a liability remains to be seen .			0
