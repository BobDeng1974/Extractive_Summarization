by @entity0 and @entity1 for the @entity2 delays in restarting four key nuclear power stations after a safety shutdown could bring an electricity crisis this winter			0
the shutdowns have dangerously narrowed the gap between demand and the amount which @entity11 can supply to homes and businesses			2
the squeeze is now likely to step up the regime where major energy users , such as factories , are paid millions to shut down in peak evening periods			1
showdown : fears over winter supplies were prompted by the temporary shutdown of four nuclear reactors at @entity25 ( pictured ) and @entity26 , which are owned by @entity27			1
a crack was found in a boiler this strict measure is vital to protect homes and families by ensuring there is enough electricity on the grid to keep the lights and heating on			1
separately , @entity11 has asked power firms to boost supplies this winter to cover the threatened shortfall			2
the problems will be seen as further evidence that @entity43 ’s dilapidated energy supply system can not meet the nation ’s needs			0
critics will also point to the decision to spend billions on green energy			0
fears over winter supplies were prompted by the temporary shutdown of four nuclear reactors at @entity25 and @entity26 owned by @entity27			1
a crack was found in a boiler at one of them in august and the closure was initially expected to be short term			1
but now the @entity57 power giant is warning there will be only be a ‘ phased return ’ between the end of october and the end of december			2
analyst @entity62 , of @entity63 , said : ‘ these are old reactors and when you go to solve one problem , you often find another you did n’t know about			2
‘ that could put them out of action for months			0
losing these power stations also means we have lost the very small amount of fat in the system			0
supply lines : there were also doubts after a fire at the @entity80 coal - fired power station in @entity81 ‘ if the weather ’s unusually bad or there is n’t enough wind or something else goes wrong , then we will be cutting it to the bone			1
’ regulator @entity89 and @entity11 , which runs the power distribution network , will pay major energy users £ 75million in the next two years to turn off lights and machines on weekday winter afternoons			1
the cost will go on to the bills of homes and businesses			0
@entity99 , director of the @entity100 , said this sort of drastic action might be expected in a third world nation			0
‘ this ca n’t be a sustainable way of managing the energy system , ’ he added			0
‘ @entity107 has to have access to secure power supplies			0
’ dr @entity110 , of the @entity111 , said : ‘ for too long , the @entity43 has failed to plan adequately to guarantee the energy supplies required for our economy , businesses and consumers			0
’ on tuesday , @entity11 said it was tendering for extra electricity supplies for winter ‘ owing to uncertainty over plant availability ’			2
ministers are relying on nuclear power to provide low carbon energy , alongside wind farms , as a replacement for coal - fired plants that are closing to meet @entity127 targets on cutting greenhouse gases			1
on top of the loss of the four @entity27 plants , other supplies have been put in doubt by fires at power stations in @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity136 , @entity137 .			1

four reactors at @entity25 and @entity26 owned by @entity27 were shut down
they may only be fully operational in december after crack found in boiler
there were also fires at the @entity80 and @entity136 coal - fired plants
@entity11 will pay major users like factories £ 75m to stop at peak times
