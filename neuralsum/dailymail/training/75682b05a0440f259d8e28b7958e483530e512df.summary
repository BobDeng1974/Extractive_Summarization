by @entity0 published : 14:02 est , 28 may 2013 updated : 00:09 est , 29 may 2013 it took a few moments for @entity4 to take in what he was seeing			2
when he did his heart nearly stopped in his chest			2
his screen was filled with the official seal of the @entity11 and the words : ‘ this site has been seized … ’ it was shortly after 9am on 15 april 2011 and @entity16 ’s chief marketing officer had only one thought , ‘ this is it			1
’ winning hand : in 2006 @entity16 and its fraternity brother founders seemed unstoppable , life was a whirl of wealth , parties and girls today that date is known in the online poker world as @entity28			1
it is the day that the @entity30 @entity11 raided three of the world ’s biggest online poker companies : 76 bank accounts across 14 countries were frozen , billions of dollars of winnings , @entity38 ‘ raking ’s and personal fortunes vanished in a congressional pen - stroke			1
now , a new book traces the chaotic fortunes of the six - fraternity brothers from the @entity42 who set up @entity16			1
out today , ‘ @entity52 ’ by @entity53 chronicles how a weekly poker game in the backroom of a bar in @entity48 , @entity44 was parlayed into one of the biggest online poker sites in the world			1
everything to play for : ( left to right ) @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59			2
some of @entity16 's founders and investors on a scouting trip to @entity63 @entity64 : @entity65 , the @entity42 fraternity where the six ' brothers ' met taking a chance on a game of skill : @entity16 's site as it appeared to players before it was seized @entity73 , his step - brother @entity59 , @entity55 , @entity4 , @entity58 and @entity74 bonded as a group in the hedonistic world of fraternity hazing as each was a brother of @entity65 at the @entity42			1
online poker was n’t a new idea – there were already a few fledgling sites – but the money making potential of the internet had yet to be fully exploited			1
the brothers thought they could do better			1
over many @entity88 fuelled hours they set @entity89 took legal advice and insist that every lawyer they spoke to agreed			2
‘ if there was n’t a law that said specifically you could n’t do it , it was presumed to be perfectly legal			2
’ the law most commonly applied to online gambling was the @entity99 of 1961			1
the @entity100 : based on another @entity53 book @entity102 , right , plays @entity104 , pictured with @entity105 as co-founder @entity106			1
@entity107 came at the expense of their friendship turning the @entity111 : @entity53 's book , ' 21 ' made into a film starring @entity114 , left , and @entity115 , centre right , told of six @entity118 students who took on the casinos of @entity120 it reads : ‘ whoever being engaged in the business of betting or wagering knowingly uses a wire communication facility for the transmission ... of bets or wagers or information assisting in the placing of bets of wagers on any sporting event or contest , or for the transmission of a wire communication which entitles the recipient to receive money or credit as a result of bets or wagers ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned … ’ the way the @entity16 boys saw it this was clearly designed to inhibit sports betting and games of chance			1
poker was a game of skill			2
realistically , for all their subsequent protestations of innocence , the way they went about establishing the business hardly smacks of transparency			2
author @entity53 whose new book tells the previously untold story of a billion dollar empire and its catastrophic collapse they chose @entity63 as their base – the location for several similar online business			1
they recruited a local expert as consultant who , when pressed on the question of legalities , informed them : ‘ this is the @entity175			2
and i do n’t see any sheriff knocking at our door			0
’ having found a base they needed to raise $ 750,000 start up			0
they found willing investors in @entity183			0
they poured the money into the @entity186 bank and were on the cusp of going live when the bank went under			0
@entity53 traces their travels from @entity191 to @entity183 , @entity192 , to @entity193 , @entity194 , the @entity195 and @entity63 in a bid to raise funds once more			1
stepbrothers @entity59 and @entity73 emerge as the most forceful characters , pushing the project on			0
@entity88 gave way to cocaine , the backroom bar in @entity48 where the idea was born gave way to the fleshpots of @entity207			1
girls were easy and labour was cheap			0
these guys were n’t internet geeks like @entity212 ’s @entity104 , @entity214 ’s @entity213 or @entity216 ’s @entity215			0
they were frat brothers keen to cash in and fund a wild lifestyle			2
and for a while they really did			0
by january 2005 @entity16 was valued at thirty million dollars and bringing in about $ 800,000 a day in revenue			1
its founders drove fast cars , raced @entity223 and @entity224 bikes and partied hard			0
but other sites were growing too and some threatened to dwarf @entity16			1
by the end of 2006 they recognized two needs : they had to ‘ gray it up ’ and ‘ look clean and pretty			0
’ @entity16 had two years of audited accounts			1
they needed three to take the company public as was their plan ; doing so would make them billionaires			0
banks were more likely to respect a company that was n’t entirely run by 25 year olds out of @entity239			0
so they set up an office in @entity242 and brought more established shareholders on @entity245 boys continued to party			0
the banks continued to make money			0
the company continued to grow at an outrageous rate			0
virtually unstoppable : @entity16 made the friends millionaires in a matter of months but their story did n't end there by august 2006 the company had grown more by 100 per cent year on year			1
they were valued at $ 100million			0
another day at the office : @entity63 was the ' ground zero ' of similar online businesses and where @entity16 was based - the @entity175 , with no sign of a sheriff but that same summer congress passed the @entity261 of 2006 ( @entity261 )			1
@entity194 ’s equivalent of the @entity263 launched an investigation into the company			0
the net was beginning to close – the ‘ gray legal area ’ rapidly hardening to black and white			0
to this day @entity73 maintains he did not know that any of the @entity16 team were doing anything wrong			1
he said he ’d ‘ fooled himself into thinking that what he was doing was okay			0
’ @entity273 : straight flush by @entity53 is out today but on 15 april 2011 all room for doubt was @entity263 had been investigating @entity16 and other sites for two years			1
the @entity278 had set up a fake payment processing company through which several sites operated , allowing forensic analysis of their finances and , the prosecution argued , attempts to circumvent the law			2
eleven people were indicted from sites including @entity16 , @entity287 , @entity288 and online payment processors			1
charges included bank fraud and money laundering			0
that only two were indicted from @entity16 – brothers @entity73 and @entity59 – may have seemed arbitrary but it was hardly something the others were going to contest			1
@entity4 left his cubicle in @entity16 the day the site was seized			1
he left @entity300 , @entity63 soon after			1
he now lives with his wife and family in @entity303 , @entity304 where he runs his own business			0
@entity73 gave himself up but refused to fully co-operate with the prosecution in return for avoiding jail time			0
instead he plead guilty to misleading banks and on 21 july 2012 was sentenced to 14 months which he is currently serving in a minimum security prison in @entity312 , @entity313			0
@entity59 was in @entity314 where he remains			0
he is not technically a fugitive as he was not ‘ on the run ’ but the @entity263 considers him ‘ at large			0
’ in july 2012 @entity16 agreed to pay $ 731million fine to the @entity30 government			1
but the story does not end quite there			2
the final card has not yet been played			0
in december 2012 the @entity11 ’s @entity320 finally and officially clarified its position regarding the @entity99			0
the @entity11 concluded that the @entity99 only applies to sports betting – just as the boys of @entity16 had done more than a decade before			1
' straight flush : the @entity325 of @entity326 who dealt their way to a billion - @entity329 - and how it all came crashing down , ' by @entity53 is out today			2
