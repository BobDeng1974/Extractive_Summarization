they were two moments that clearly meant a great deal			0
after @entity3 fired @entity4 into a 14th - minute lead at @entity6 on saturday night , be made a beeline for @entity8 and gave his new boss a warm embrace			1
and after scoring the deflected goal that earned the @entity4 all three points at @entity13 , he leaped joyously into the air , spun and did that @entity16 thing of flexing his muscles			2
this was the measure of a man grateful for another opportunity to prove his talents , grateful for a change of scenery , a fresh challenge and a little bit of faith shown in his undoubted abilities			0
@entity3 celebrates after his goals helped @entity4 to a 2 - 1 win at @entity6 on saturday @entity3 made a beeline to his manager @entity8 after opening the scoring in the 14th minute at @entity6 @entity3 embraced his compatriot @entity8 after giving @entity4 the lead the winger jumps for joy after scoring what proved to be the winning goal on @entity41 2004 - 2007 @entity42 ( 59 appearances , 6 goals ) 2007 - 2009 @entity45 ( 73 appearances , 15 goals ) 2009 - 2011 @entity48 ( 63 appearances , 8 goals ) 2011 - 2012 @entity51 ( 5 appearances , 0 goals ) 2012 - @entity54 ( 68 appearances , 4 goals ) 2014 - 2015 @entity4 ( on loan , 2 appearances , 2 goals ) 2009 - @entity60 ( 27 appearances , 2 goals ) @entity3 , a 27 - year - old @entity63 winger , certainly comes with a bit of a chequered past and a bad - boy reputation			1
@entity54 , the @entity67 club who loaned him to @entity4 this month , were glad to see the back of him			1
but his double at @entity6 , which returned @entity4 to third place in the @entity72 , suggests that all this trouble could be behind him			1
@entity3 was certainly very humble in his post-match interview : ' i want to thank first my team - mates and trainer and chairman			2
they have trusted me , they gave me the chance to play for @entity4			2
' the feeling for the first goal was like a dream come true			0
the second was like i do n't feel nothing in my body			0
' when asked why he ran straight for @entity8 after his firm , low first - half strike found its way under the body of goalkeeper @entity93 , he replied : ' i wanted to thank him that he gave me the chance to play for @entity4			2
' he was the only one that believed in me			0
the players have helped me from the first moment			0
the captain ( @entity98 ) speaks a lot with me			0
' @entity3 certainly looked chuffed and a new chapter in his life and career has been started			1
his story began at local side @entity42 , whom he joined as a nine - year - old and made his professional debut for in 2004 at the age of 17			1
@entity3 playing for his first club , @entity42 , as a teenager back in 2006 elia in action for @entity112 during an @entity114 fixture with @entity115 back in 2006 quickly establishing himself in the first team , @entity3 scored six times in 59 appearances for them before friction between himself and new coach @entity122 pushed him to the exit door			1
there was talk @entity126 wanted to sign him but the @entity128 side wanted to loan him straight back to @entity112 , by then a second division side , and back into conflict with @entity122			2
he joined @entity45 instead and found some of his best from under @entity133 , scoring 15 times in 73 outings for the club in his two seasons there			1
while at @entity45 , @entity3 was given his first taste of @entity141 and @entity142 football and became a fixture in the @entity145 21 team			1
named the @entity147 in 2009 , there were again suggestions @entity126 and @entity149 were interested in signing him but his next move would take him over the border to @entity152			2
again , it was n't without controversy			0
amid all the speculation of a move to one of @entity60 's big clubs , @entity3 signed a two - year contract extension at @entity45			1
two months later , he announced he wanted to leave at the end of the season			0
elia battles for the ball with @entity165 defender @entity164 during a 2008 @entity142 tie 2011 - before his move to @entity51 , @entity3 was fined by @entity48 for complaining that the club had n't looked after him following an ankle operation			1
2013 - caught speeding at 3am alongside now @entity171 midfielder @entity170			0
it was alleged that the pair had insulted and acted agressivley towards the police officer			0
2014 - @entity177 ' @entity176 ' ahead of @entity54 vs @entity48 clash before insulting a fan of his own team via @entity181			1
@entity48 paid @entity45 £ 6.5m for his services but very little went to plan			1
he suffered an ankle injury in late november of his first season and missed the rest of the campaign			2
in march , a poorly - applied tattoo went septic and the discomfort was so severe , @entity3 was unable to wear his playing and training kit			0
his second season at @entity48 saw @entity3 becoming increasingly allergic to the club - he moaned that the playing style did n't suit him , he was rotated in and out of the team and he claimed @entity48 did n't look after him while he was recuperating from surgery on his injured ankle			1
it came as little surprise , then , to see @entity3 sold off to @entity199 giants @entity51 in a £ 7m deal in august 2011			1
despite being a @entity60 international , he played infrequently and though he collected a @entity204 winners ' medal he contributed little towards it			1
one of @entity3 's few appearances for @entity51 came in a commemorative friendly against @entity208 he spent just one season with the @entity199 giants , appearing in just five matches and failing to score @entity3 playing for @entity60 during a 2010 @entity212 warm - up match against @entity213 being introduced to the media as @entity54 's new @entity215 after signing from @entity51 in 2012 inevitably , the restless @entity3 grew impatient and left @entity216 for @entity54 in an attempt to again revitalise his career			1
the @entity67 side , great rivals of his former club @entity48 , paid £ 4.5m and offered a £ 2m salary			1
he was billed as the man to fire @entity54 back into @entity225 competition			0
in reality , they spent two and a half years battling relegation while @entity3 kept putting his foot in it			0
in april 2013 , @entity3 and team - mate @entity170 , now at @entity171 , were caught speeding at 3am			0
it was later alleged that the two players had acted aggressively when stopped and insulted a police officer			0
their punishment was to spend the rest of the season training in isolation but while @entity170 moved to @entity171 , @entity3 decided to stay			1
after failing to find the net during his first season in @entity241 , there was an improvement last season , with four goals in 33 appearances			0
but @entity3 was still proving a nuisance off the field			0
before the @entity248 against former club @entity48 , he tweeeted the words ' @entity176 ' , a sentiment that unsurprisingly does n't go down too well in @entity152			1
he later insulted a @entity54 fan on @entity181 , telling them to ' go f * * * youself			0
' by that time , @entity54 were sick of the sight of him and looking to farm him out on loan			2
@entity4 were willing to take the gamble , with the option of signing him permanently at the end of the season			2
right now , that is looking like a distinct possibility as @entity3 strives to put a turbulent past behind him			2
reaching for the ball with @entity268 player @entity267 in an august 2012 fixture			0

@entity3 is on loan at @entity4 from @entity152 side @entity54
@entity3 has a controversial past and is seeking a fresh start in @entity72
he started at @entity42 before moving to @entity45 and then @entity48
but after falling out with the club following injury he joined @entity51
@entity60 international failed to make an impression on @entity204
@entity3 joined @entity54 after one season but did n't match *expectations*
*social* media spats led to him being ushered out of the club on loan
