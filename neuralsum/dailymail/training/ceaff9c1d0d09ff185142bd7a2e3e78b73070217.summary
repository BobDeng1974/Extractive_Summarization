@entity1 's £ 2.5billion pupil premium has failed to narrow the gap between the achievements of the poorest schoolchildren and their wealthier counterparts underprivileged pupils fell further behind better off children last year despite @entity1 ’s flagship policy to narrow the exam gap between them			1
the gulf widened in 72 out of 152 local authorities in a year despite extra funding from the pupil premium policy , according to left - wing think - tank demos			1
this included 66 where the difference was larger than before the premium was introduced			1
the analysis was based on the number of pupils gaining five or more gcses with a c grade or higher , including @entity24 and maths			0
the achievement gap is measured by the difference between the results of those pupils receiving free school meals and those whose parents pay for their children ’s school dinners			1
last summer ’s exam results revealed it had reached 26.7 percentage points across @entity24 , up from 26.4 points in 2011 - 12			0
in 2010 - 11 it was 27.5 percentage points			0
but if inner @entity41 is removed – where the difference closed from 18.9 percentage points to 18.6 points over three years – the average gap in 2012 - 13 rises to 29.5 points			2
the capital has benefited from another initiative , the @entity49 , which has improved academic results for poorer children by pouring millions of pounds into schools			2
the lack of progress made nationwide since the £ 2.5billion - a - year pupil premium was introduced in april 2011 is an embarrassment for the deputy prime minister , who included it in the 2010 @entity60 manifesto			1
it comes just a week after another of his policies , to double the number of free nursery places for deprived two - year - olds , was criticised for threatening to lower standards unless it was delayed			2
the @entity71 education charity warned many of the extra staff needed would be former childminders , who tend to have lower qualifications than nursery workers			0
the pupil premium was introduced in april 2011			1
at present , the scheme provides primaries with an extra £ 953 for each child on free school meals and secondaries with £ 900 for each such pupil			1
exam results from last year show that in 72 out of 152 local authorities the ' attainment gap ' widened , and in 66 the difference was greater than before the premium was brought in the widest gaps were found in the @entity91 , with 42.5 per cent in @entity92 , @entity93 , and 39.6 per cent in @entity94			1
@entity41 had the three smallest gaps - 4.2 per cent in @entity96 and @entity97 , 7.7 per cent in @entity98 and 9.5 per cent in @entity99			0
@entity100 , an education specialist at the think tank @entity101 , said : ' the attainment gap has been a difficult nut to crack in recent years			0
' the pupil premium is supposed to finally close it and is a good policy in theory			1
' a separate report out today says social class is still ' exerting a powerful influence ' on the skills of @entity24 adults			0
the @entity113 in @entity41 said the attainment gap that opens up at school carries on into adulthood			0
it added : ' the relationship between parental background and adult literacy and numeracy among those aged 16 to 24 is stronger in @entity24 than in all other countries except the @entity124			0
' a @entity126 spokesman said that since 2010 the achievement gap had fallen faster than at any time since 2002			2
‘ we are taking decisive action to support disadvantaged pupils and close that unacceptable gap , ’ he added .			0

in 72 of 152 local authorities , the gap between grades of underprivileged children and their wealthier counterparts got worse last year
in 66 the gap widened faster than before the pupil premium was introduced
the £ 2.5billion policy was included by in the @entity60 *election* manifesto
