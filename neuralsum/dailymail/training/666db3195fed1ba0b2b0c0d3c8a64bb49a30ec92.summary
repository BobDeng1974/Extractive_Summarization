@entity0 admits @entity1 missed out on a gem when they pulled out of a deal to sign @entity4 in 2013			1
@entity0 had lined up the striker , then with @entity6 , following the @entity8 ' promotion to the @entity9			1
the move appeared to be well advanced , with a Â£ 4.5million fee attached , until a medical highlighted concerns over a knee issue			1
@entity4 could have been facing his current club if his move to @entity1 had n't fallen through @entity0 tried to sign the striker when he was playing at @entity6 but he failed a medical due to a knee problem that condition had not troubled @entity4 before and has not surfaced since , with @entity20 being rewarded for stepping in to sign the player after @entity1 demurred			1
@entity4 scored 20 times last season as @entity23 won promotion from the championship and has excelled in the top flight this term , netting 13 times to date			1
@entity0 welcomes @entity29 to the @entity30 on saturday as @entity1 face @entity20 in an important game for both sides ' survival prospects , and there will be a tinge of regret that he is not donning the black and amber			1
' our loss is @entity20 's gain , ' said @entity0			2
the @entity1 boss would have loved to be able to pick @entity29 in his side for saturday 's game with @entity20 ' not only has he done as much as anyone this year but last season he scored the goals that got them into the @entity9			1
that is what he was brought in to do			0
' it is never easy to score goals			2
we are all looking for someone like that			0
he has got 13 and that is a healthy return with 13 games to go			0
' we 'd identified him			0
i think he would have been a real terrific player for us , as he has proved			0
he is a goalscorer with a fantastic attitude			0
' that @entity4 has not suffered any significant knee problems since @entity1 passed on him resonates with @entity0 , who had a similar problem before joining @entity63 only for sir @entity64 to sign him anyway to great success			1
the striker was in training with his team - mates this week in preparation for the crucial clash at the @entity71 ' going back 30 years , i failed my medical with a knee injury i did n't know i had , at @entity63 , ' said @entity0			2
' they signed me on my playing record and the belief that i 'd never had a bad knee			2
' it went back to something when i was a kid , at the age of 12			0
incredible.the sad thing ( for @entity29 ) is he probably never knew he had a funny knee , or something wrong with his knee			0
