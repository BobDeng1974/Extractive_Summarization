@entity9 - based @entity8 has revealed that it will continue to market the ‘ @entity12 ’ furniture and home furnishings line			1
@entity0 has been under fire since the revelation earlier this year of a legal deposition in which she admitted under oath to having used the n - word			2
good news for @entity0 as finally a sponsor announces that they 're sticking with the embattled celebrity chef @entity9 - based @entity8 has revealed that it will continue to market the ‘ @entity12 ’ furniture and home furnishings line many companies have dropped @entity0 since the deposition became public including @entity3 , @entity26 and the @entity27 , pharmaceutical company @entity28 and her book publisher			1
but on wednesday @entity32 president & ceo @entity33 announced the company is going to stand by @entity0 after ‘ a very difficult few weeks			1
’ ‘ obviously , we feel terrible for @entity0			1
the @entity0 we know – and the one i believe you have gotten to know – is not the same person as the one being portrayed in the media , ’ @entity33 said in a letter sent to retailers			2
‘ yes , she has acknowledged saying some hurtful things but she has also apologized , and we accept that			0
we also feel equally dismayed for those hurt by @entity0 ’s remarks , which for certain do not represent our own diverse culture and beliefs at @entity8			1
’ @entity48 , right , @entity0 's longtime chef , has accused the celebrity chef of asking black kitchen workers to wear @entity52 - style outfits in the letter , @entity33 said after careful consideration , ‘ we have decided to move forward with the @entity0 brand and will continue to market her collections as the @entity12 from @entity32			1
’ @entity33 said over the past few weeks , they heard from many retailers expressing ‘ passionate support ’ for @entity0			1
‘ several factors contributed to this decision – our belief that @entity0 is not the person portrayed by the media , our confidence that the brand will continue to have significant retail value , and most importantly the feedback that we have received from you , our customer , ’ @entity33 said			1
the announcement comes hot on the heels of another employee of @entity0 coming forward to make accusations about the celebrity chef			2
@entity48 , @entity0 ’s longtime chef , has accused @entity0 of asking black kitchen workers to wear @entity52 - style outfits and claims @entity75 staff were also asked to ring a bell while hollering ‘ come and get it ’			1
@entity78 also alleged that she was paid just $ 10 an hour and had to endure the tv chef using racist language around her			0
in a statement to the @entity83 , @entity0 ’s spokesman denied asking anybody to dress like @entity52 and denied using racist words in relation to her staff			0
according to a @entity0 spokesman : ‘ @entity89 ’s complaint is not about race but about money			2
‘ it is about an employee that despite over 20 years of generosity feels that she still deserves yet even more financial support from @entity0			2
’ the claim is the latest blow to @entity0 , who is currently scrambling to salvage what is left of her $ 17m a year empire over the race row			2
a message for her ex-sponsors : hardcore @entity0 fans are sending butter wrappers to the companies that dropped her as a protest die - hards @entity0 fans have taken to sending empty butter wrappers to her former sponsors as a protest at what they believe is her unfair treatment after admitting to using racial slurs			1
the ‘ we support @entity0 ’ campaign is the brainchild of @entity125 , a hotel night auditor in @entity126			1
when a host of sponsors severed ties with @entity0 following her infamous ‘ i is what i is ’ interview on the today show , he decided to do something to show his support for her			1
‘ in a lot of ways , she reminds me of my mom - this funny , gracious lady from a different era , ’ he told @entity136			0
‘ my mom probably used that word and she was n’t a racist			0
’ he describes her sponsor 's actions as a ‘ betrayal ’			0
first he setup the ' we support @entity0 ' @entity149 page , which has attracted over 600,000 likes			0
then he and fellow supporters hit upon the idea of sending butter wrappers to her old sponsors as a form of protest - inspired by her favorite cooking ingredient			0
butter for @entity0 : a website has been launched providing fans with addresses for the companies that have severed ties with her the ‘ we support @entity0 ’ campaign is the brainchild of @entity125 , right , while another fan , left , posts a photo on the group 's website to mourn the closure of the @entity171 chain ‘ the butter itself is @entity0 and these wrappers are void of butter , just like these companies are void of @entity0 , ’ explained supporter @entity172			1
initially @entity125 wanted to mail actual butter sticks until he realized that would get very messy			0
@entity125 and his fellow @entity0 fans do n’t expect that the sponsors will take her back as a result of their efforts , but they wanted to do something to express their support for her and what they feel has been a witch hunt against their favorite celebrity chef			2
‘ i sent a butter wrapper knowing that the chuck - a - lucks down at the @entity27 probably would n’t even open it , ’ wrote @entity189 , a supporter from @entity190 , in a @entity149 message			0
‘ but i felt compelled to do something to show that this kind of railroading , for whatever hidden - agenda - ed reason it happened , is not looked kindly upon by the consuming public			0
’ ' i is what i is ' : after the controversial today show interview @entity0 's sponsors started to leave her in droves as well as the facebook page there is also the ‘ @entity213 ’ website which features the slogan – ‘ a corporation without @entity0 is like a butter wrapper without butter ’			1
@entity214 , from @entity215 , @entity216 , volunteers her time to helping run the campaign and believes @entity0 has been made a scapegoat			0
‘ it was n’t about the n - word ; it was about the extortion thing , about this one crazy employee , ’ @entity214 told @entity136			0
‘ my interest is in @entity0 ’s business			0
to me , it ’s about a self - made woman			0
you have to ask yourself , “ if she was a man , would this happen ? if she was from the @entity9 would this happen ? ” and you know , i do n’t think it would			0

one of the chef 's sponsors has announced that they are sticking by her
@entity9 - based @entity8 will continue marketing the ‘ @entity12 ’
but @entity0 had lost 13 other high profile brands - and millions of dollars in fees - since admitting to using racial slurs
