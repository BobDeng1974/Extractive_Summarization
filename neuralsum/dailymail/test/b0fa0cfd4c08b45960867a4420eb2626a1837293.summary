changes : @entity1 , head of the @entity3 exam board , said schoolchildren would only have a short time to use the search engine during tests - and compared it to using a calculator in a maths exam an exam board boss has today been accused of ' dumbing down standards ' after suggesting students should be allowed to use @entity13 in their gcse and a-level exams			1
@entity1 , head of the @entity17 ( @entity3 ) , said schoolchildren would only have a short time to use the search engine during tests - and compared it to using a calculator in a maths exam			1
he said most pupils now learn through search engines anyway â€“ and teachers should test how students interpret answers , rather than how they find them			1
today @entity28 , chairman of the @entity29 , said the idea would lead to a ' dumbing down of standards '			1
he told @entity34 's today programme : ' it 's a nonsense			1
' we have a crisis in standards in this country			2
we are three years behind the @entity40 at the age of 15 , we have got universities running remedial courses			2
' we have got employers saying too many youngsters are unemployable			0
' and here we have the @entity3 board saying " let 's dumb things down "			1
row : education campaigners say that this would send standards plummeting and said exams are about knowledge not hunting for information ranking : according to the latest @entity57 international rankings on education , from 2013 , the @entity55 is behind much poorer countries including @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 ' you can have an exam on how to use @entity13 , but that is not the same as having a history or geography exam			1

it includes knowledge , therefore we do have to test what children are carrying the in their heads			2

he added : ' you do need to have a base understanding of things			0
' actually , one of the most important things is about understanding what comes up on @entity13 or some search engine			0
' it is about understanding the tools they have got available and how to utilise those			0
' i think that is a very rich way of learning and a very rich way of assessing			0
' that is relevant , that is what they will be doing in working life			0
' he said @entity13 could be allowed on some papers but not others , depending on the type of questions being asked			0
' you ask different questions and it is about interpretation , ' he added			0
' it 's about discussion , it is about application			2
' he said he could not see @entity13 coming in any time soon but suggested it was ' certainly inevitable ' longer term .			0
