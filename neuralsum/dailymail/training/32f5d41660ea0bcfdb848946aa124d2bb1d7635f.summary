by @entity0 published : 19:53 est , 17 january 2013 updated : 19:53 est , 17 january 2013 top police officers are in line for inflation busting pay rises of up to ten per cent			1
the bump could be worth up to £ 18,000 a year for @entity6 at a time when the starting salary for a @entity9 was cut by £ 4,000 to £ 19,000			2
the fall of a fifth left starting salaries at the same level they were a decade ago and less than a trainee manager at @entity15			0
and sparked fury among rank - and - file officers			0
both changes were among recommendations from the overhaul of pay and conditions proposed by former rail regulator @entity23			1
starting salaries for new police recruits have dropped £ 4,000 to £ 19,000 , while top officers could get £ 18,000 more			1
file picture last night @entity29 , chair of the @entity30 , said : ‘ at a time when police budgets are being slashed and police pay is being reformed to the detriment of serving officers , we are amazed that @entity37 will have the budget available to increase the salary of @entity6 by 10 per cent			1
’ coming months will see the appointment of top officers in around a quarter of forces , as incumbents retire or move to new jobs			0
many were temporary appointments in advance of the elections for @entity48 last year			0
last week @entity49 , former head of the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) was appointed as to head the @entity52 and @entity53 force			0
the @entity30 chair said he is ' amazed ' at the proposed wage hike yesterday acting chief constable of @entity57 and @entity58 was appointed to fill the job on a permanent basis			1
the new pay regulation , signed off by home secretary @entity62 , will allow @entity63 to vary the existing starting salaries for @entity6 by up to ten per cent			2
the pay levels for senior officers are set according to the size of the force they are commanding			2
at the top end are the @entity71 and @entity73 forces which came with a starting salary of £ 181,455 in 2010			2
the @entity76 chief earns £ 169,359 and @entity78 and @entity79 chiefs £ 157,260			1
salaries are then staggered down to the lowest level , £ 130,044 for five smaller forces , including @entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85			0
the @entity86 said it was right for @entity63 to be given the ‘ flexibility ’ to change salaries , which they would have to account for to the electorate			0
the new arrangements for new recruits will see those with no experience seeing their starting salary cut by 17 per cent			0
recruits with experience , such as those who have volunteered as a special constable , can earn up to £ 22,000 a year			1
mrs may is yet to decide whether to accept another @entity103 recommendation that would allow chiefs to sack under - performing officers			0
a @entity86 spokesman said : ‘ pccs have been elected by the people to hold the police to account and it is only right they are given some flexibility on employing chief constables			1
‘ that is why independent reviewer @entity23 recommended chief officer basic pay could be raised or lowered by up to 10per cent when @entity63 are recruiting new chief constables			1
‘ our police reforms are introducing modern management practices at all levels of policing , giving the added flexibility required to forge a force fit for the 21st century			0
