@entity0 held talks with influential @entity4 shareholder @entity2 on wednesday as he attempts to advance a £ 16million bail - out plan for the club			1
the @entity8 - based businessman is heading an alliance of potential investors offering substantial financial input in return for control via a new share issue			2
@entity16 ’s position is significant as he currently holds voting rights for 26 per cent of existing shares			0
that provides an effective power of veto over the @entity0 group plan , as a new share issue would require the backing of 75 per cent of existing shareholders at an agm			2
@entity0 , pictured in @entity27 earlier this year , held talks with @entity2 on wednesday neither party made any comment after they attempted to address numerous issues in their telephone discussion , but @entity0 is expected to release a statement on thursday			1
the @entity35 - born tycoon is hoping to reach an agreement - in - principle with the @entity38 board before he returns to @entity39 , although it remains to be seen if that will be possible			1
@entity0 is working in conjunction with other individuals including former director @entity44 and shareholder @entity45 , who loaned the club £ 1m in emergency funding earlier this year			1
it ’s believed another loan could form part of the new package the group has put forward , with the aim of providing a financial bridge to the agm			0

@entity4 director @entity2 ( left ) with brother @entity66 ( right ) and chief executive @entity67 during a match in @entity69 in january the situation is further complicated by the fact club accounts should be signed off ahead of an agm			2
however , auditors @entity72 need to see a clear picture of the financial future before doing so			0
formal agreement over a loan plus equity deal could be the answer , but it ’s thought the @entity0 group would only agree to offering a loan if assured they will gain the 75 - per - cent backing required for their larger investment plan			1
should that proposal flounder then a loan from @entity85 would seem the likely alternative source of funding for the club			0
@entity85 recently increased his @entity4 shareholding to 8.9 per cent and has requested an @entity91 to remove chief executive @entity67 and ally @entity92 from the board			2
the @entity95 owner is thought to have been in talks over a loan prior to last month ’s stop - gap £ 3.13m share offer , but those discussions reportedly broke down when @entity85 wanted club trademark rights included in the deal			1
