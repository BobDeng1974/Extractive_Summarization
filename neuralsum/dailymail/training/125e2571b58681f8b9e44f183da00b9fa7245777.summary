by @entity0 getting out into the garden or doing @entity2 could save your life , claim researchers			1
older people with active hobbies cut their risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke , and their chances of dying from any cause by up to 30 per cent			1
a new study found ‘ working out ’ in the garden or the home was as good as going to the gym for keeping the heart healthy			2
a 12 - year study in @entity19 has found that active hobbies , such as gardening or doing @entity2 , can cut the risk of hear disease and strokes in elderly people by up to 30 per cent ( file picture ) experts say it shows the benefits of active daily routines , which counteract the harm caused by sedentary lifestyles			1
the study monitored the heart health and daily activities of almost 4,000 people aged 60 in @entity37 , @entity19 , for 12.5years			1
participants took part in an initial health check , which included information on lifestyle , such as diet , smoking , and alcohol intake , and how physically active they were			0
they were asked how often they did a range of daily life activities , such as gardening , @entity2 , car maintenance and blackberry picking over the previous 12 months , as well as any formal exercise			1
their cardiovascular health was assessed using lab tests and physical examinations , to check on blood fats , blood sugars , and blood clotting factor , high levels of which raise the risk of heart attack and stroke			2
the study looked at the daily activity and heart health of 4,000 pensioners and found that those who had an active hobby and took regular exercise were at lowest risk at the start of the study , those who had a generally active daily life had a much lower risk profile for cardiovascular problems , irrespective of how much formal exercise they took , than those with low levels of daily activity			1
this profile included smaller waists , lower levels of potentially harmful blood fats , and lower glucose , insulin , and clotting factor levels in men			0
the same was true of those who did a lot of formal exercise , but who were not routinely physically active very often			2
those who exercised regularly and were also often physically active had the lowest risk profile for heart problems			1
during the 12.5 year monitoring period , 476 of the participants had their first heart attack and 383 died from various causes			0
the highest level of daily physical activity was linked with a 27 per cent cut in risk of a heart attack or stroke and a 30 per cent reduced risk of death from all causes , compared with the lowest level , regardless of the amount of formal exercise undertaken			1
compared with young adults , older people spend proportionately more time doing routine activities which makes it important for them to be physically taxing , says a report published online in the @entity119			0
researcher @entity120 , of the @entity121 , @entity37 , said ‘ our findings are particularly important for older adults , as they often find it difficult to achieve recommended exercise intensity levels			0
’ in the @entity127 people are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening , dancing or brisk walking , or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport , running or aerobics every week			2
the report suggests extra energy expenditure is behind the health improvements , because prolonged sitting reduces metabolic rate to the bare minimum , while standing up and physical activity increase it			0
it says the muscular contractions necessary for being active counteracts the damage done by sitting down , which does n’t require any muscle effort			0
normal hormone production is affected , with potential adverse effects on many body organs and tissues			0
dr @entity151 , reader in @entity152 , @entity153 , said : ‘ this study is excellent news for large swathes of the population who might not want to run , swim or go to the gym because it clearly shows that even moderate , non-exercise activity like gardening benefits the health of older adults			2
the study will bring relief to many older people as it shows that even gentle workouts can have health benefits ‘ we must be careful when generalising of course , because older adults tend to be less fit , so gardening represents relatively hard exercise for them			2
‘ we still need to promote moderate or vigorous exercise like fast walking , running , swimming and cycling in younger people			0
‘ while the amounts reported here are okay for older people , children still need to do an hour of activity every day to be healthy and that needs to be hard enough to make them breathe hard and preferably feel hot			0
’ dr @entity183 , senior clinical lecturer and honorary consultant cardiologist , @entity187 / @entity186 , said : ‘ this study emphasises the importance of physical activity for prevention of cardiovascular disease rather than simply focusing on sport or dedicated exercise sessions			1
' although studies like this can not prove that physical activity reduces risk of heart disease , it is clear from this and similar surveys that the more active a person is ( in the broadest sense ) the less likely they are to develop heart disease in the years to come			1
‘ although this study only examined people aged 60 , it is reasonable to assume that the more active someone is throughout their life , the lower their risk of cardiovascular disease			1
‘ the message i take from this study is simple			0
if you want to reduce your risk of heart disease , be more active			1
do n’t sit down for long periods ; get up on your feet and do something you enjoy that involves moving around			0

@entity224 activity of 4,000 pensioners measured for study
hobbies such as gardening and @entity2 meant lower risk of heart disease
those who stayed active and took exercise were at lowest risk
