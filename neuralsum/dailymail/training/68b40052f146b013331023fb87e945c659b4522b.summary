by @entity0 published : 05:15 est , 7 march 2014 updated : 10:48 est , 7 march 2014 families bereaved by level crossing accidents have received a ‘ full and unreserved apology ’ from the boss of @entity5			1
chief executive @entity7 today apologised for the ‘ failings ’ by the company in ‘ managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected ’			1
the move came after mps expressed their concerns that @entity5 showed ‘ callous disregard ’ on ‘ too many occasions ’ for families bereaved by accidents at crossings			1
@entity5 chief executive @entity7 apologised live on @entity24 programme @entity22 for the ' failings ' by the company in ' managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected ' a report by the @entity29 highlighted the deaths of @entity31 , 14 , and @entity32 , 13 , pictured , who were killed at @entity34 crossing in @entity35 in december 2005 the @entity14 said all nine deaths at crossings in 2012/13 were ‘ personal tragedies which could have been averted ’ and said mr @entity7 ‘ owes each of the families it let down a full , public apology ’			1
launching the @entity44 report , chairman @entity45 said : ' victims were erroneously described as ' trespassers ' or accused of ' misuse ' of the railway when , in fact , they tried to use level crossings appropriately			1
' @entity5 's chief executive must provide a full , public apology to all of the families it has let down - both for the mistakes which contributed to the accidental deaths and for the subsequent treatment of bereaved families			1
' @entity5 must also demonstrate that it has transformed the way in which it deals with people whose lives are changed by accidents at level crossings			1
' today , @entity5 boss @entity7 apologised for ‘ failing to deal sensitively ’ with the tragic deaths			1
he said : ‘ i wish to extend a full and unreserved apology on behalf of @entity5 to all those whose life has been touched by a failing , however large or small , made by this company in managing public safety at level crossings and in failing to deal sensitively with the families affected			1
a cyclist was nearly hit by a train at @entity77 crossing in @entity78 in 2013 despite the warning lights flashing and the barrier being lowered a van reversed to narrowly avoid collision at the @entity84 level crossing , @entity85 , in 2009 ‘ nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by the families of those killed or injured at a level crossing			2
today @entity5 is a very different company to the one which existed at the time of these tragic accidents			1
’ in the @entity97 report , mps said they would be ‘ very concerned ’ if @entity5 executives got bonuses this year , given the company was recently held responsible for a 2010 incident at @entity101 in @entity102 in which a 10 - year - old boy suffered life - changing injuries			1
another case the committee highlighted was the deaths of @entity31 , 14 , and @entity32 , 13 , who were killed at @entity34 crossing in @entity35 in december 2005			2
it said the rail company should disclose to the @entity34 families the findings of all investigations into why the documents were not initially disclosed			1
during his apology today , mr @entity7 , pictured right on @entity24 's @entity22 , said the company would address many of the committee 's recommendations			1
he said : ' we will never be complacent when it comes to public safety ' during his apology today , mr @entity7 said the company would address many of the committee 's recommendations			1
he said : ‘ as we made clear when we pleaded guilty during the @entity34 court proceedings , it was a watershed in the way we thought about our approach to the risk at level crossings , and how we treat victims and their families			2
‘ as a result of this transformation , level crossings in @entity135 are amongst the safest in @entity136 , but there is still much that we can , and will , do and the committee 's recommendations will help us in that endeavour			2
‘ we will never be complacent when it comes to public safety			2
as i start my term as chief executive i have made improving public , passenger and work - force safety absolutely integral to everything @entity5 does			1
the @entity97 report said rail regulators should set a target of zero fatalities at level crossings from 2020			2
a man missed being struck by a moving train as he jumped onto a crossing in @entity156 , @entity157 , in 2009 ‘ restoring public trust relies on openness and with that in mind we have made risk assessment information relating to almost all our 6,300 crossings available on our website			2
i will continue to explore ways to make our processes even more transparent so we can demonstrate clearly that we treat our responsibility for ensuring public safety with the utmost professionalism			0
’ however , @entity32 's father @entity170 told @entity171 's today programme he still found it ‘ difficult ’ to understand how @entity5 ‘ failed to consider the feelings of any of the families involved ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity5 showed the utmost disregard to the families , to the point that they never contacted us , showed no concern or compassion at any point and indeed made it very clear that they blamed @entity183 and @entity184 for their own demise up until they were forced to acknowledge their own guilt more than six years after the accident			1
mr @entity7 , pictured , said : ' nothing we can say or do will lessen the pain felt by the families of those killed or injured at a level crossing ' a mother pushed her pram across a railway crossing in front of a moving train at @entity199 in @entity200 in 2009 ‘ my daughter died over eight years ago , and still this goes on , and it goes on because of @entity5 's behaviour , because of their refusal over years to acknowledge documents which they knew they had in their possession and to behave in just a human way			1
’ mr @entity7 said that since 2010 @entity5 had reduced the risk at level crossings by a quarter by investing around £ 130million in level crossing safety improvements			1
these include closing nearly 800 crossings and appointing more than 100 level crossing managers , building footbridges to replace crossings , installing new warning systems and putting in power - operated gates and using new barrier technology			0

@entity34 , @entity35 , 2005 - on december 3 2005 , @entity31 , 14 , and her friend @entity32 , 13 , were on their way to @entity230			0

after purchasing their tickets , the miniature warning lights and yodel alarm indicated that there was a train approaching.after a train had stopped in the station they opened the unlocked wicket gate and proceeded back across the line			0
they were hit by a @entity251 train			0
