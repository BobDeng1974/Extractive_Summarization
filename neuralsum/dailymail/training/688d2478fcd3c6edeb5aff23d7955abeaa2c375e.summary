sad : @entity9 , 47 , and @entity10 , 50 , have been charged with grand larceny after allegedly stealing $ 100,000 in old bills which was hidden in widow @entity11 's basement ( house pictured ) @entity22 police detective @entity33 said the $ 100 bills were printed before the federal government made anti-forgery changes in 1991			1
that includes the 1996 redesign making the portrait of @entity40 on the front off - center and bigger			0
he said people in the small town of @entity22 residents started talking when the money surfaced just days after @entity9 and @entity10 had quit their jobs			1
the drama began when @entity11 hired the men in 2010 to work on her home - a large , white , two - story farmhouse with the wrap - around porch that she shared with her husband for decades before he died			1
she told the workers just before her husband died seven years ago , he said he had hidden thousands and thousands of dollars in the basement			1
her family had never found the money			0
if the workers discovered the cash , @entity11 said , they would be in for a big reward			1
after hearing about their free - spending ways , @entity11 went to @entity10 and @entity9 and made an offer			1
keep what they bought and a bit more money for themselves , give the rest back to her and she would n't go to police			2
they played dumb , and the law got involved , detective @entity33 said			0
now the men are facing grand larceny charges , accused of taking the $ 100,000			1
and @entity11 has sued the owner of the company they once worked for to get her money back			2
she has n't seen any of the cash from the workers , @entity33 said			2
' they quit their jobs the day after they found the money , ' detective @entity33 said			0
' and they did n't waste any time spending it			0
' old - fashioned : police said the $ 100 bills were so old , they did n't even have the off - center portrait of @entity40 @entity11 's late husband had founded a business that sold small crane games , arcade games and other amusement devices			1
he also was in real estate and kept large amounts of cash around			0
after he died in 2003 , his family searched for the cash he had hidden in the basement			2
each time someone came to work at the old house , @entity11 offered a nice reward if the workers found the money			2
it was the same offer she made to @entity10 and @entity9 in september 2010 , but they left the three - day job without telling her anything , police said			1
the spending spree started a few days later			0
@entity9 had the underpinning of his mobile home secured with bricks			0
@entity10 bought a $ 1,800 television , a $ 1,800 riding lawn mower and a $ 7,500 used car for his girlfriend			2
' the man at the car dealership took the money to the bank to verify it was n't counterfeit , ' detective @entity33 said			0
that kind of money spent in @entity22 , a city of about 12,000 people , led folks to start asking questions			0
one of the in - laws of the men heard how the workers got the money and told @entity11 and police about it			1
after the men refused @entity11 's offer to not get the law involved if she got some of the money back , she called police too			1
detectives tracked down the worker who spruced up @entity9 's mobile home and he still had the old $ 100 bills			1

an address for @entity9 could not be found , and an eviction notice was posted to the front door of @entity10 's home			2
in september , @entity11 sued @entity163 , owner of @entity164 , which hired the workers			2
her lawsuit said @entity163 should have made sure his employees were properly supervised so they did n't steal from her			0
the suit asks for $ 100,000			2
@entity163 did n't respond to a message from the ap. a man who answered the door at @entity11 's home , would n't identify himself and refused to say where @entity11 was			0
@entity11 's lawyer also did n't respond to phone calls or emails			0
@entity10 's lawyer asked for a preliminary hearing , telling a judge the charge should be dropped because authorities ca n't prove the money was taken from @entity11 's home or even that it ever existed			1
he compared it to a leprechaun promising a pot of gold , according to a report on the hearing by @entity189			0
the judge allowed the case to continue , and detective @entity33 said she believes the prosecution has a strong case , adding , ' we 've got documents and proof they spent it like crazy			0
