water companies were yesterday ordered to slash bills – but will still end up charging households more because of inflation			1
regulator @entity4 told suppliers to reduce average customer bills by 5 per cent by 2020 , a £ 20 drop from £ 396 to £ 376			1
in a new five - year plan , they must also invest £ 44billion to help stem water leaks by 370million litres a day and curb the hours homes are left without water because of repair works			2
water companies were today ordered to cut bills by an average of 5 per cent by 2020 - but only after inflation but customers are set to end up paying more because firms can increase bills annually in line with @entity24 ( @entity24 ) inflation – currently 2.3 per cent			1
many homes will see bills of more than £ 400 for the first time next year			0
by 2020 , assuming the same inflation rate , they could be £ 420			0
it will be a particular blow for older customers on a limited income since state benefits and many occupational pensions only rise in line with @entity36 ( @entity38 ) inflation which is a much lower 1.3 per cent			0
in a bid to support the worst off , @entity4 is to ensure companies offer social tariffs to an extra million households			0
these deals offer discounts of up to 25 per cent off regular water bills			1

‘ companies will need to stretch themselves to deliver much more with the same level of funding as in previous years			0
