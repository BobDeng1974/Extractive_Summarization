by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:30 est , 27 october 2012 updated : 10:58 est , 30 october 2012 sportsman : @entity3 in action during a rugby match a rugby player has accused police officers of trying to hack the phone he had used to record them taking a break - locking it for a staggering 42 years			1
management trainee @entity3 , 20 , used his mobile phone to record footage of five officers outside a bar and coffee shop			1
but he was then approached by two of the officers who accused him of being drunk and disorderly and put him in handcuffs			2
the @entity21 player was arrested and spent the night in a police cell before being released - without his iphone			0
but when the handset was returned five days later it had a screen message stating : ' @entity23 is disabled , try again in 22,461,058 minutes ' - more than four decades			0
he claims this was due to the handset being tampered with repeatedly in a crude effort to crack the password			0
but mr @entity3 , who played rugby for a south - west @entity33 under - 16 squad , was able to retrieve the 51 - second video and show it to @entity36			2
police have referred the incident to their professional standards department but say the officers involved refute mr @entity3 ’s claims			1
but @entity3 , of @entity42 , @entity43 , said : ' the only logical explanation for my phone being disabled for 42 years is that someone had been trying to access my files to delete the video footage of officers in the club			1
' i was not drunk and disorderly and i believe the only reason for my arrest was my taking footage of the officers standing at the bar			2
' i ’m discussing what to do , including court action and a complaint to the @entity61 , with my solicitor			0
' recalling the incident , mr @entity3 and one of his friends said he was approached by the officers who had seen him filming			1
the friends say the officers discussed whether to arrest 6ft 5in mr @entity3 under @entity69 of the @entity70 , then decided on ‘ drunk and disorderly ’ after he protested			1
at this point , mr @entity3 says he was seized by one of the officers and led off to a car park behind the @entity76 venue just off @entity77 where police patrol vehicles were parked			1
mr @entity3 says he was handcuffed and bundled into a vehicle and taken to the custody suite at @entity81			2
there , he claims he repeatedly asked to be breathalysed to prove that he was not drunk but that was refused			0
@entity85 policy is to offer breathalyser tests only to drink - driving @entity87 , he says , he was put in a cell overnight and released the next day			0
mr @entity3 says his mobile phone was returned five days later – after the intervention of his solicitor and on condition he paid an £ 80 fixed penalty – but it was blocked			1
with help from a software programme ironically named @entity96 , he was able to unlock the phone and retrieve the film			0
@entity76 : @entity3 filmed officers apparently having a break in the @entity43 bar and cafe while on duty chief superintendent @entity104 , @entity105 , said in a statement : ‘ no formal complaint has been made and the @entity108 have not seen the alleged footage			1
' however , due to the serious allegations being made by @entity112 , this will now be subject to an investigation by the @entity114 who are responsible for the oversight of all conduct matters attaining to police officers and staff			0
’ @entity120 said records showed mr @entity3 chose to pay the fixed penalty rather than have the matter heard in court			2
mr @entity3 ’s allegations , if upheld , will add to the @entity43 force ’s tarnished reputation			1
the @entity61 is already investigating failures in the case of murdered @entity130			0
taxi driver @entity131 could n’t be tried for the crime , even though he confessed , as detectives had denied him his rights under the @entity135			0
last year deputy chief constable @entity136 , 49 , hanged himself after 13 female staff made 26 separate complaints against him of inappropriate sexual advances .			0
