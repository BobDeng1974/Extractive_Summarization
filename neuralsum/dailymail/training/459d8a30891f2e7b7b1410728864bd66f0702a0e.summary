by @entity0 grammar schools plan to admit more poor pupils , it was revealed yesterday			1
they are aiming to take a higher proportion of students who are eligible for free school meals by changing admissions policies			1
over-subscribed schools could give preference to @entity12 pupils who pass the 11 - plus test , just as children in care are currently given priority			1
priority : grammar schools could give preference to pupils eligible for free school meals , as they already can for pupils in care , according to plans unveiled by the schools minister @entity25 ( file photo ) selective schools also aim to hold more 11 - plus ‘ familiarisation sessions ’ with primary schools , and to develop exams that are ‘ resistant to coaching ’ to help give a level playing field			1
schools minister @entity25 discussed the plans before the commons education select committee			1
he highlighted the @entity35 ’s pupil premium policy – extra cash given to schools based on the number of their pupils eligible for free school meals , given to the poorest , and those in care for six months or longer			1
he told mps : ‘ we are trying to talk to grammar schools about giving young people fairer access opportunities			0
‘ we are trying to allow them to use the pupil premium as a factor in their admissions policy , we are trying to encourage them to ensure that testing is fairer to young people			0
’ fears : there have long been claims that wealthier pupils ' monopolise ' grammar places with private tuition some grammar schools admit by ranked order – all candidates are ranked by their 11 - plus score			1
in other areas , pupils who pass the test are then ranked by admission criteria , which can include the distance they live from the school			2
the schools are being encouraged to adopt @entity12 as another admission criteria			0
policy : the plan was unveiled by the schools minister @entity25 , pictured @entity77 , of the @entity78 , said some do this already – but ‘ more are likely to do so as they look at the issue ’			1
he said : ‘ we have been negotiating with the @entity84 to make sure we can get the right form of words for schools			0
it ’s a decision for each and every individual school ... but where people want to do it , we ’re looking at ways to support them			0
’ mr @entity77 said grammar schools ‘ are not looking to lower the standard at all ’			0
he added : ‘ schools might have two , three , four categories of criteria where people are given preference			2
‘ some schools for example , might include an admission criteria in favour of @entity12 but only in their local area			0
’ education charity @entity106 has said grammar schools are being monopolised by affluent pupils			2
its research shows just 2.7 per cent of entrants to grammar schools are eligible for free school meals			1
in december , @entity114 ’s chief inspector of schools , sir @entity113 , claimed that ministers should resist calls to expand grammar schools because they are ‘ stuffed full ’ of middle - class children and fail to improve social mobility			2
‘ @entity126 - elbowed ’ parents who move house to get children into top schools are not at fault , the schools minister said yesterday			1
@entity25 rejected the idea that those who pay a premium to live in good catchment areas should be blamed			2
he said : ‘ to do all you can to help your children succeed in life is exactly what we want everybody to be doing			0
‘ so i ’m afraid that we ca n’t cap any of those opportunities			0
what we need to do is extend them to those young people who are not getting them at the moment			0
’ he also attacked the ‘ tolerance of failure ’ for poorer pupils .			0

plans were revealed yesterday by the schools minister @entity25
