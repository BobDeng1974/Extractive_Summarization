the rebels , who are members of the @entity9 terror group , were filmed attacking centuries - old graves in the north - west city of @entity12 in @entity14 province			1
donning balaclavas and black coats , they swung sledgehammers into the tombs , causing pieces of dust and stone to fly through the air			1
the prophet , who is the central figure in the @entity40 's @entity39 , is best known for being swallowed by a fish or a whale , depending on translation			0
the attack is the latest in the @entity2 's violent rampage across @entity5			1
earlier this week , a series of images emerged showing the destruction of almost a dozen @entity49 and @entity51 religious shrines in @entity12 , @entity5 's second largest city , and the town of @entity53 , which is also currently under @entity2 control			1
armed : the rebels , who are members of the @entity9 terror group , were filmed attacking centuries - old graves in the north - west city of @entity12 in @entity14 province			1
above , an @entity2 militant vandalises a tombstone smash : donning balaclavas and black coats , the rebels swung sledgehammers into the green tombstones @entity2 militants believe giving special veneration to tombs and relics is against the teachings of @entity34			1
speaking of the latest attack , @entity14 official @entity74 , told @entity76 : ' the elements of @entity2 [ have ] controlled the mosque of the @entity32 in @entity12 since they invaded the city			1
' ' [ they ] engaged in the process of tampering with the contents of the @entity83			0
it is still held by them until now			0
' the shrine of the @entity87 ( @entity88 ) was also destroyed by rebels , according to reports			2
revered tomb : one of the devastated tombstones belonged to the @entity31 ( @entity32 in @entity33 ) and was revered by @entity34 and @entity35 alike , authorities said			1
another belonged to the @entity87 ( @entity88 ) it comes as more than 50 bodies have been discovered by @entity5 authorities in an agricultural area outside the city of @entity100 , just south of @entity101 , today			1
military spokesman brigadier general @entity102 said most of the 53 bodies were found blindfolded with their hands bound and several gunshot wounds			1
the grisly discovery in @entity100 , a predominantly @entity49 city around 60 miles south of @entity101 , has raised concerns over a possible sectarian killing amid the battle against a @entity51 insurgency			1
brig gen @entity112 said an investigation was underway to determine the identities of the dead , as well as the circumstances of the killings			1
isis have been attacking a host of historical sites across @entity5 as part of their terror campaign the dead were all men between the ages of 25 and 40 , and it appeared they had been killed a few days earlier and then dumped in the remote area , said a local police officer and a medical official			2
they officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to brief the media			0
a lightning sweep by the insurgents over much of northern and western @entity5 in the past month has dramatically hiked tensions between the @entity49 majority and @entity51 minority			2
at the same time , splits have grown between the @entity49 - led government in @entity101 and the @entity142 autonomic region in the north			2
destroyed : the photographs were posted on a website which frequently carries official statements from the @entity9 extremist group prime minister @entity148 today accused the @entity142 zone of being a haven for the extremists and other @entity51 insurgents			0
the claims are likely to further strain @entity101 's ties with @entity155 , whose fighters have been battling the militant advance			2
mr @entity148 lashed out at the @entity155 in his weekly televised statement , saying ' everything that has been changed on the ground must be returned ' - a reference to disputed territory @entity142 fighters have taken			0
he went a step further , saying : ' we ca n't stay silent over @entity166 being a headquarters for @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and the terrorists			0
' @entity168 is the acronym in @entity33 for the @entity173 , often used as a pejorative by its opponents , while the @entity169 was the party of former dictator @entity175			0
but mr @entity148 provided no evidence to back up his claims , which are sure to be rejected by @entity142 leaders in @entity166			0
evidence on the ground also contradicts his allegations			0
while the motives in this case remain unclear , such killings hark back to the worst days of @entity5 's sectarian violence in 2006 and 2007			2
at that time , with a @entity51 insurgency raging , @entity49 militias and @entity51 militant groups were notorious for killings of members of the other sect			2
bodies were frequently dumped by roads , in empty lots , ditches and canals			2
as the levels of violence dropped over time , such discoveries became rare			0
but sectarian tensions have soared once more and authorities have once again begun to find unidentified bodies since the @entity51 militant offensive swept across much of northern and western @entity5			1
the militant surge is led by the @entity9 extremist group , but other @entity51 insurgents have joined , feeding off anger in their minority community against the @entity49 - led government			0
prime minister : @entity148 today accused the @entity142 autonomic region in the north of being a haven for the extremists and @entity51 insurgents			0
he said : ' everything that has been changed on the ground must be returned ' on the other side , @entity49 militias have rallied around mr @entity148 's government to fight back against the militant advance			0
in the far north , @entity155 have taken advantage of the mayhem to seize disputed territory - including the city of @entity226 , a major oil centre - and move closer to a long - held dream of their own state			2
@entity142 fighters say they only want to protect the areas from @entity51 militants			2
many of the areas have significant @entity142 populations that they have demanded for years be incorporated into their territory			0
these moves have infuriated mr @entity148 , who is under pressure from opponents as well as former allies to step down			0
the photographs of the destroyed churches and mosques that emerged last week were posted on a website which frequently carries official statements from @entity2			2
some of them showed bulldozers plowing through walls , while others featured buildings being demolished by explosives in a cloud of smoke and rubble			0
three @entity51 clerics were also killed by @entity2 gunmen in @entity12 after calling on locals to reject the terror group and refusing to leave the city , authorities said			1
the victims were @entity262 , 43 , @entity263 , 39 , and 48 - year - old @entity264			0
today , archbishops from @entity101 , @entity12 and @entity226 said the violence in @entity5 is hastening the end of nearly 2,000 years of @entity268 there as the few remaining faithful flee @entity9 militants			1
war and sectarian conflict have shrunk @entity5 's @entity35 population to about 400,000 from 1.5million before the @entity274 - led invasion in 2003 , they said on a visit to @entity276 seeking @entity277 help to protect their flocks			1
and now , even those who stayed are leaving for @entity281 , @entity282 and western @entity283 , they claimed			0
the three - @entity284 , @entity285 of @entity286 and @entity226 's @entity288 archbishop @entity287 - are all @entity289 whose churches have their own traditional liturgy but are loyal to the pope in @entity293			0
' the next days will be very bad			0
if the situation does not change , @entity35 will be left with just a symbolic presence in @entity5 , ' said @entity284 , who is based in @entity101 ' if they leave , their history is finished			1
' more than 50 bodies have been discovered by @entity5 authorities in an agricultural area outside the city of @entity100 , just south of @entity101 , today			1
