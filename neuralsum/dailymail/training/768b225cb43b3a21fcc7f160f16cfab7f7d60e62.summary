by @entity0 published : 11:31 est , 25 october 2012 updated : 16:45 est , 25 october 2012 for a millennium , it has stood as a monument to one of the bloodiest struggles in @entity8 ’s history			1
hordes of tourists troop to @entity11 to stand at the spot where @entity13 fell at the @entity14			1
now , if the theories of a local historian are to be believed , they may be going to the wrong @entity18 claims the spot where the @entity14 is commemorated is not actually where the fighting happened			1
according to mr @entity18 , the supposed site of the struggle , marked by @entity11 , is a mile away from the real scene of combat in 1066			1
members of historical re-enactment groups , assuming the role of @entity29 and @entity30 soldiers , perform the annual re-enactment of the @entity14 at @entity11 mr @entity18 points out that no human remains or artefacts from the conflict have ever been found near @entity11 , even though some 10,000 men are believed to have died there			1
his theory is that the real site of the fighting was the steep @entity39 , to the north - west of @entity41 – and if he is proved right , history books around the world may have to be rewritten			2
thousands of tourists flock to @entity11 every year to learn about the conflict , which resulted in the death of @entity13 and played a pivotal role in the @entity47 by @entity48			1
now mr @entity18 , 61 , is calling for the site at @entity50 to be excavated to see whether the remains of battle victims are buried there			1
the @entity54 , part of which is pictured , famously depicts the 1066 battle which saw @entity13 supposedly shot through the eye with an arrow in what was a decisive victory for @entity48 he said : ‘ i assumed everything was known about the @entity14 but i found that almost nothing is known by way of fact			1
excavations have been carried out at @entity11 and remnants pre-dating the battle were found , but nothing relating to the conquest			1
some 10,000 men died at the @entity14 ; there has to be a mass grave somewhere			2
’ it is documented that @entity13 assembled his @entity8 army on @entity50 before advancing on @entity73 – or @entity74 – a mile away to meet the invading @entity30			1
another section of the @entity54 which depicts the @entity14			2
historian @entity76 has claimed that the conflict may have actually taken place on @entity50 and not at @entity74 as historically thought but mr @entity18 believes @entity13 never left his defensive hilltop position and the @entity30 took the battle to the @entity8			1
he has studied contemporaneous documents in the national archives and built up a dossier of circumstantial evidence that he believes proves his theory			2
witness accounts from 1066 state the battle was fought on steep and unploughed terrain , consistent with @entity39			1
@entity73 , meanwhile , was cultivated and had gentle slopes			1
the @entity91 at @entity11 , @entity92 , @entity93			2
the @entity94 stands close to the site where it had been thought that the @entity14 took place in addition , the @entity30 erected a cairn of stones on the battle site to commemorate their victory , known as a ‘ mount - joie ’ in @entity104			1
the summit of @entity50 is still known as @entity106			1
one @entity8 source from the time , @entity107 , also stated that the battle was fought nine miles from @entity41 , the same distance as @entity39			2
@entity13 is supposed to have abandoned his high position to meet @entity48 on lower ground , a tactic that makes no sense as he would have been moving away from his reinforcements			2
furthermore , mr @entity18 believes he has identified the site of a mass grave where the fallen soldiers may be buried			2
mr @entity18 , from @entity119 , @entity120 , has made his arguments in a book called @entity14 – the uncomfortable truth , to be published in january			2
he added : ‘ two days after the battle the @entity30 moved on towards @entity126			0
they had two days to get rid of the thousands of bodies			0
you ca n’t dig that many graves in such a short space of time			0
‘ at the bottom of @entity50 is @entity134 ditch , i believe the bodies were rolled down the hill and dumped in this ditch which was filled in			1
a proper archaeological dig of that ditch needs to happen			0
’ @entity140 , the regional curator for @entity141 which owns @entity11 , said they were obliged to look into alternative theories for the battle site			0
but he said the spot the abbey is built on is based on a number of historical sources and is documented before 1120			0
he added : ‘ it would be premature to comment on mr @entity18 ’s thesis until the book is published			0
’ it has historically been believed that the @entity14 took place at a site now known as @entity92 on october 14 1066			1
@entity13 organised his troops in three wedges on @entity157 , overlooking the battlefield			0
he had little more than 5,000 weary men who found themselves up against a @entity30 force of up to 15,000 infantry , archers and cavalry			1
facing such odds , @entity13 had no choice but to fight a defensive battle			0
he was forced to rely on the much - vaunted @entity8 shield - wall			0
his men could stand and let the @entity30 attacks break themselves			0
the tactic was initially very successful			0
relentlessly , the @entity30 knights hurled themselves against the @entity8 shields , but were unable to make any headway			0
then the @entity174 led by count @entity175 on the @entity30 left began to give way			0
the whole incident is portrayed on the famous @entity179 tapestry			1
now the @entity8 wall had broken , and the @entity30 were able to lever open the cracks			0
exhaustion and the shear numbers of @entity30 took their toll			0
@entity187 and @entity188 , the two remaining brothers of @entity13 were killed according to the @entity189 , and @entity13 was soon to follow			0
we see him taking an arrow in the eye and then being ridden down by a @entity30 cavalryman , one of four who managed to break through the @entity8 line and trample @entity13 into the ground			0
though the @entity8 still fought on bravely after their king had fallen , their cause was lost , and eventually they fled into the night			0
