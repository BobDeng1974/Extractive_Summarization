' you know , my consultant keeps telling me death could come at any moment , ’ sir @entity0 told an interviewer two weeks ago			1
he laughed as he said it , because @entity0 - undoubtedly one of the leading @entity9 composers of the past century - had been cheating death for more than three decades			1
since june 1980 , in fact , when a stroke hit him while driving one of his beloved @entity15 back from the @entity17 in @entity18			2
the lord 's @entity0 : his work reflected a deep religious belief it temporarily damaged his left arm and hand , and his vocal cords were permanently impaired			1
but he battled on , enduring several major heart operations , until this week the death he had avoided for so long finally claimed him			2
i had hoped to see him this weekend at the premiere of three new choral pieces to be given at @entity32 , but alas it is not to be			0
the recital by an @entity36 choir will continue as a tribute			0
@entity0 , who died at 69 , was hugely tall - 6ft 6in - and extremely thin , with long bony arms			1
he suffered from @entity39 , a genetic disorder which attacks the heart , and which affects some people with that body shape			0
his health had been in terminal decline for months - he had to take 15 pills a day for years			2
but he kept working , regarding his afflictions as a test of his profound religious belief , which dominated his life and entire creative thinking			1
my friend @entity51 , @entity53 ’s morning presenter , described to me yesterday how he was speaking at an arts festival in @entity55 last june about his favourite subject , @entity57 , when he was astonished to see @entity0 wheeled in by his devoted wife @entity58			1
early fans : sir @entity0 , pictured here with sir @entity62 , was a friend of the @entity63 and released an early work called @entity65 on their @entity67 record label @entity0 rushed over to speak to him			1
@entity0 ’s first question was typical : ‘ was @entity57 religious ? ’ @entity0 replied there was no evidence @entity57 went to church of his own volition , but his later music reveals a deep spirituality , perhaps arising out of his own suffering			1
@entity0 nodded ; he knew better than anyone what suffering does to the creative spirit			1
some it destroys ; others it enhances			0
and i profoundly believe that physical suffering was the making of @entity0 as a composer			1
for he was a man unrecognisable for the past three decades from the show - off i first encountered in an apartment adjacent to the @entity90 in the late @entity91			0
then in his early 20s , @entity0 was kitted out in velvet , looking like a cross between @entity94 and @entity95			1
and it was hard , at first glance , to know on which side of the sexual fence he had placed himself			0
but since he was going out with the sister of my hostess , @entity100 - later the founder of the @entity102 website - i , not without some hesitation , inclined towards the @entity107			1
royal approval : sir @entity0 was also a friend of prince @entity110 - the two are pictured here together in 1998 after a @entity0 concert at @entity113 raised in a @entity115 family - which ran a building firm - in @entity118 , @entity119 , he had won a music scholarship to @entity121 before studying at the @entity122			1
at the time we met , he had just enjoyed a huge success with @entity65 , a bizarre cantata filled with all manner of curious electronic effects , that had so impressed @entity63 , they paid to have it recorded on their new @entity67 label			1
@entity0 had befriended @entity131 after the composer ’s brother had done renovation work on the drummer ’s house			1
@entity131 introduced @entity0 to @entity137 , who was very taken by a recital the slender musician gave him of an opera he had written			1
it was this unlikely association that led @entity67 to release @entity65 in 1968 - which featured @entity131 yelling through a loud - hailer			0
spiritual : sir @entity0 finally found peace and fulfillment in the @entity147 @entity146 ( @entity0 himself credited @entity131 as being largely responsible for the release of @entity65 and another @entity67 album , @entity151			1
) this , then , was the man i encountered at that party : with his long , flowing blond locks , and beautiful , monk - like visage , he was quite the cat ’s whiskers , and preened himself like a prize - winning @entity161 pussy			0
being myself then a scrofulous undergraduate who thought charisma was december 25 , i can tell you i resented him like mad			0
a few years after that evening , in november 1974 , @entity0 married a young @entity147 dancer called @entity167 , who had been training at the @entity168			1
though the composer ’s father bought the couple a house in @entity119 , @entity0 refused to move away from his mother			1
@entity174 : in 1991 sir @entity0 married @entity175 , whom he had met when she was just 20			1
the couple are pictured here in 1998 it was an unhappy union , and just eight months later they parted			0
incredibly , the marriage appears to have been unconsummated - and was annulled			0
years later @entity0 , said cryptically : ‘ i matured very quickly in some ways , very slowly in others			1
i think i ’ll leave it at that			0
’ despite this , he developed a reputation as a playboy - largely because he liked to drive a @entity15 and mix with famous people			2
at one point he escorted the actress @entity190 , and befriended prince @entity110			1
in a 1995 biography , he was described as having an obsession with charismatic older women - and a penchant for nubile ‘ muses ’ in their 20s			2
recognition : sir @entity0 was knighted in 2000 for services to music it was in 1991 that he married again , to @entity175 , whom he had first encountered six years before when she was just 20			1
in one interview , @entity0 revealed he married her only on the condition they had no children			2
yet she proceeded to do just that			0
she slipped them in , ’ he admitted with a smile			0
he had been ‘ terrified ’ that having children would ruin his creativity , but confessed that despite the hurly - burly of family life - he and @entity58 had a son and two daughters - he ‘ just carried on writing ’			0
and carry on writing he did			0
in 1997 , his @entity215 was played at princess @entity217 ’s funeral - he later said it was the only good piece played that day			1
for my part , the scales really fell from my eyes where @entity0 is concerned more than two decades after i met him , when i put on a new recording by that master cellist @entity224 of a new piece by @entity0 called @entity226			1
in it , the cello plays continuously at the top of its range throughout this extraordinary 45 - minute meditation			0
the music has an intensity , an ecstatic brilliance , that could have been composed only by a genius , which is what i now profoundly believe @entity0 to have been			1
sadly , i had little or no chance to follow up on that memorable meeting years before			0
had i done so , i dare say i would have recognised a very different man from the self - adoring figure i had encountered			2
for @entity0 , life was a spiritual journey			2
though he never quite abandoned his love of opulent cars , @entity247 restaurants and red wine			0
‘ every time i have a hit , i buy a @entity15 , ’ he once quipped			0
his journey towards spiritual truth began as a teenage organist in a @entity254 , and finally brought him peace and fulfilment in the @entity257			0
on stage : sir @entity0 received a lifetime achievement award at the 35th @entity261 in @entity262 his profound religious sense was coupled with a range of often extreme and deeply eccentric opinions			1
in interviews , he would always sound a bit odd , because he probably was in truth pretty odd			0
‘ i feel a connection with pine trees , ’ he told a recent interviewer , straight faced			0
genius : when composing , sir @entity0 said he went into ' another world , another state ' and his view that serious music ended when it stopped being created for @entity277 , was , to put it mildly , eccentric in the extreme			1
happily he lived to repent of that , telling @entity51 about the joy he derived from @entity57 , and other 19th - century composers whom he had once dismissed			0
for him , his work was his salvation			2
and his faith allowed him to work with great intensity			2
when composing , he said , he went into ‘ another world , another state ’			0
everything he produced apparently required no rewrites , as if he was a chosen instrument through which heavenly sounds were transmitted			0
his faith also gave him the forbearance to endure the endless criticism his music received : too eclectic ... no discernible development ... ‘ holy mush ’ ... @entity0 probably saw that one as a compliment			1
while writing this , i have spent an agreeable couple of hours listening to some of @entity0 ’s finest achievements			2
i emerge confirmed in my view of his stature , and feeling cleansed by the experience			0
this is surely the heart of his appeal			0
his music is not always sophisticated , but it is totally sincere			2
its sense of religious certainty appeals even to those like myself who are not formally religious			2
all of us long for a spiritual dimension in our lives , and @entity0 ’s music provides it			1
not only that , anyone with a musical sense can appreciate it			0
he certainly was n’t one of those contemporary composers who thinks if his music is popular , it ca n’t be any good			2
many years ago , @entity325 - an early fan of @entity0 - got the younger composer absolutely right			1
‘ he adores the past , and he builds on the past , ’ @entity325 wrote			0
i am sad that @entity0 is gone , and deeply distressed at all he had to endure for so long			1
but it made him the composer he became			2
he leaves behind a formidable body of work , one i believe will last			2
he observed that : ‘ i can look back over [ my ] work and say i ’m not ashamed of it			2
that ’s a good feeling			0
’ i would argue he is part of that great @entity337 choral tradition that flourished in the 15th and 16th centuries			0
this unique and fascinating man would have looked for no higher praise than that .			0

@entity343 met sir @entity0 when the composer was in his early 20s
then he cut a *dashing* , @entity107 figure and had many famous friends
an early major work was released on a record label owned by @entity63
@entity0 also became friends with prince @entity110 , and his music was played at princess @entity217 's funeral in 1997
he was deeply religious , and his devotion fed into his work
his faith also kept him working as his health declined
sir @entity0 died peacefully at home on monday
