by @entity0 published : 10:01 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 11:06 est , 27 september 2012 these are the magical pictures that create the illusion of a phantom mountain on the horizon			2
adventurous photographer @entity6 climbed to the summit of @entity8 in the @entity10 @entity9 25 times to capture his astonishing images of the mind - boggling sight			1
after spotting the trick of the light for the first time , the 43 - year - old , from @entity19 in @entity20 , became committed to making the three - and - a - half hour journey as often as he could			1
sheer magnificence : the shadow falling across a valley at sunset looks exactly like the outline of another mountain cloud atlas : @entity10 photographer @entity6 , 43 , has climbed to the spot 25 times to produce these breathtaking images he has now collected an impressive collection of photos of the shadowy double mountain , all taken at sunset from 3,538 metres up			1
on some occasions he would be thwarted by the cloud , but on others he would capture the perfect spectacle			2
mr @entity6 , a professional musician , originally noticed the beautiful illusion while on a camping trip in the area			1
' i was setting things up to spend the night at high altitude and getting a bit of clean snow to melt for water , ' he said			2
' looking east i saw this massive area , like a huge mantle , conical and dark			2
romantic view : the vista from more than 3,000ft up makes a misty peak appear , nestled among @entity10 's @entity9 spirits in the sky : mr @entity6 says the ghostly effect prompts a ' rediscovery ' of nature 's phenomenons ' i thought " wow "			1
the mountain seemed to be projecting itself into the valleys below			0
' i 've seen many shadows around the @entity67 , all kinds of reflection and endless plays of light , but i 've never seen such a perfect shadow anywhere else			0
' over his 25 expeditions to the summit in @entity77 - the highest peak in the @entity79 - he has collected many photos of the magnificent view			1
mr @entity6 , from @entity19 , in @entity20 , added : ' what i love about these photos is that the phenomenon is totally natural			1
' no one would be surprised to see his own shadow on the sidewalk while walking in the city			0
@entity89 moment : the professional musician feels able to look at something everyday - in this case , a shadow - from an entirely different vantage point in this spot ' shadows are just part of our daily lives			0
the physical process here is the same , but applied to the immensity of a mountain			0
' for me this parallel between the ordinary and the immense leads to a sort of " rediscovery " , making me think about the laws that govern our lives all the time			0
' his two day trips - usually alone , but sometimes with his partner - follow the same routine of watching the sunset , followed by the stars and then the sunrise			0
mr @entity6 , a classical organ player , added : ' it is absolutely quiet up there - if there is wind i hear its sound , but apart from that only the passage of a bird breaks the absolute silence			1
' his aim was to catch a shadow falling across a valley , which creates the spectacular illusion of an extra mountain appearing on the horizon .			0
