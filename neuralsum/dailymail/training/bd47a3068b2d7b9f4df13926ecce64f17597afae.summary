by @entity0 published : 18:22 est , 26 september 2012 updated : 18:22 est , 26 september 2012 no other way to obey : labour deputy leader @entity2 said she supports calls for a press regulator @entity5 will back statutory regulation of the press deputy leader @entity2 reveals today			1
in an interview with @entity9 , miss @entity2 said the opposition supports calls for a law to set up a press regulator , arguing there is no other way of ensuring papers agree to obey the rules			1
the intervention puts @entity5 at odds with some senior @entity20 , including the prime minister , who has warned that he would prefer to avoid statutory regulation since that could lead future generations of mps to meddle with press freedom			1
miss @entity2 has made clear @entity5 opposes political interference in the content of papers , and any attempt to police the division between fact and comment - proposals examined by @entity34 ’s inquiry into the media			1
but she rejected a proposal drawn up by @entity37 and @entity38 on behalf of the existing regulator the @entity39 which would have seen papers sign a binding contract with the regulator to stick to the rules with punitive fines when they are broken			2
that plan would avoid the need for a new law , but miss @entity2 said that would not be tough enough since it may lack the teeth to force proprietors like @entity51 of the @entity52 - who withdrew from the @entity39			1
miss @entity2 said : ‘ the big challenge is how you make sure that we get a proper press complaints system , ’ arguing that previous failures ‘ gave the press a sense of impunity ’			1
‘ in terms of the press complaints the fundamental issue is not having a situation where people decide not to opt into a press complaints system			2
‘ any press complaints system has got to deal with the problem of impunity			0
it has got to apply to all the newspapers not just those who chose to have it apply to them			0
apply to all : miss @entity2 said the challenge will be getting a ' proper press complaints system ' and that it must apply to all newspapers , ' not just those who chose to have it apply to them ' ‘ for all that @entity37 and @entity38 think that people are going to sign binding contracts , @entity51 has already said he might not , so i think there will need to be a statutory underpinning ’ of the new organisation ‘ independent from @entity85 , politicians and government ’			1
she added : ‘ it ’s hard to see how you can otherwise have something which applies to all newspapers but which does not gave that power			0
however else could it be done ? ’ the way is now paved for a political row over the recommendations of @entity34 , who is expected to propose some sort of statutory regime when he reports next month			0
@entity98 has said the @entity99 will back @entity34 , and if necessary a statutory code as long as his proposals are ‘ proportionate ’			2
will back it : @entity98 said the @entity99 will back @entity34 , and if necessary a statutory code as long as his proposals are ' proportionate ' she also insisted that newspaper websites should be covered by the same press code of conduct as their papers - despite claims from editors that this puts them at a commercial disadvantage relative to other internet media outlets			2
‘ it ’s the newspapers ’ own code so it ’s quite invidious of them to argue that it ’ s oppressive for them to abide by it when they ’ve said that is the code they themselves have adopted			0
‘ the papers remain very influential particularly in setting the whole agenda for the rest of the media so having accountability is very important			0
’ she said it would be ‘ difficult ’ to draw up a new regulator for internet publications but would merely ask some web - based media outlets to ‘ opt - in ’ to the new organisation			0
‘ you could certainly have a position which applies to all newspapers but allows them to opt - in even if they ’re offshore			0
