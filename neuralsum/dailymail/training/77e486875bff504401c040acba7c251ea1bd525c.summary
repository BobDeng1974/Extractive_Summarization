i ’m going over there to win , and if i win and play well , then my life becomes more enjoyable			1
‘ i still feel like a player			2
i still feel like i can perform for a number of years , so i want to go to a club with a winning mentality — a team that is used to winning but also a team that ’s got people that want to win in the future			1

their pursuing me was very aggressive			2
they basically told me what i wanted to hear			2
i hope i can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team			2
’ @entity0 admitted , however , that the lure of life in @entity76 played a big part when it came to choosing the right move for his wife @entity80 and their three young daughters after so long on @entity83			1
‘ there ’s obviously a bonus of where the @entity1 are located as well , ’ he said			1
‘ that will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different			2
‘ the big challenge is going to be settling in			2
i ’ve lived in @entity4 all my life			1
i ’m a scouser through and through			0
i love my city , i love my roots			0
but , you only get one life			0
it ’s important to try different things and it ’s also a big thing for my children too ; to give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well			0

i can promise them i will give everything i have got within to try and bring success this season — and hopefully come back			0
‘ that ’s the message : my relationship with @entity4 does n’t end in the summer			1
in fact , it will never end			1
’ however , @entity12 believes that @entity4 and manager @entity127 should have tried harder to keep @entity0 , and suggested that it was always their intention to let him leave			1
‘ @entity4 let it get to november or december before they offered him anything , ’ @entity12 told @entity129			1
‘ that says to me that the club and @entity127 were already thinking about him moving on			1
it stinks a bit for me though that they treat a player like that			0
we saw the same thing with @entity138 and @entity139			0
clubs say , “ we have offered him a new deal ” , but it ’s always on reduced wages			0
‘ it ’s not how you should treat someone who has put their all into a club			1
’ my next team is going to be @entity1			1
i 'm really excited for a new challenge in my life - that 's the team i will join at the end of the season			2
their pursuing me was very aggressive			0
the talks @entity157 had with them are very positive , they basically told me what i wanted to hear			0
they told me about the winning mentality of the club , their aims and what their goals are for the future and it basically suits me at this stage of my career so i will be hopefully going over there to win some medals and finish my career over there			1
there 's obviously a bonus of where the @entity1 are locateed as well			1
that will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different			0
it 's really exciting both on and off the pitch but the most important thing is that i go there and it 's a success on the pitch and then hopefully i can enjoy it off the pitch as well			0
the big challenge is going to be settling in , i 've lived in @entity4 all my life			1
i 'm a scouser through and through			0
but , you only get one life , it 's important to try different things and experiences and it 's also a big thing for my children too - to take them out of their comfort zone and give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well			0
it 's perfect timing for this new challenge			0
i 'm really excited and looking forward to it , but i 've still got a few things that i 've got to try and achieve before i go so my focus is on that			0
there will be plenty of time to get excited at the end of the season about the new move			2
it 's the right time for a new challenge , a fresh challenge at this point of my life and an exciting one too			0
i 'm going to be moving to the most successful team in the @entity2			2
i 've watched a lot of their games and i also know a few of the players that have been there and sampled it and i 've heard great things about it so for this stage of my career i believe the timing is right to move on			0
i still feel like a player , i still feel like i can perform for a number of years so i want to go to a club with a winning mentality - a team that is used to winning but also a team that 's got people within there that want to win in the future			1
i know the players have got a winning mentality , they 've proved it over a number of years			0
having spoken to the manager , @entity58 , and also the people above him - they 're very aggressive and they want success and that 's what i want			0
that 's how i want to finish my career so they are the reasons that i chose @entity1			1
i 'd like to think i 've got the same attitude as the people that have tried to make this signing happen - the manager , the ceo and the owner - they all seem to me to be like winners and that is how i see myself			0
i 'm very professional and go about my work to a good standard on a daily basis			0
i like to try and find consistency			0
i hope i can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team			0
