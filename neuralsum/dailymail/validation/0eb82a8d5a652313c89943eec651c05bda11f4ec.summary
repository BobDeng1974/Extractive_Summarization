a recording made of the evening shows the performer , who has not been named , belting out the rock classic on the club 's stage , which features a pole for the venue 's usual performers			1
in the footage , the man warms up the crowd by playing air guitar and posturing before attempting to swing around the pole at the centre of the stage			1
but the man 's hand passes several inches from the pole and he flies past it and - to screams from the crowd - falls straight off the stage and on to the line of judges			2
luckily , a judge manages to move out of the way as the man falls and the performer hits the ground with a thud , but is said to be fine			0
