by @entity0 published : 08:45 est , 10 january 2014 updated : 08:56 est , 10 january 2014 a quarter of television viewers now watch their favourite programmes using catch - up services , it has been revealed , after the recent episode of @entity7 picked up an extra 3.5 million viewers through @entity9 in the days after it was first broadcast			1
@entity7 now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time , overtaking the 2011 @entity12 special , which received 3.1 million views through @entity14			1
when total viewing figures are analysed , roughly a third of those who watch a programme will now do so through an online catch - up service or or through their television 's recording device			1
play it again : @entity7 now has the highest post-broadcast viewing figures of all time			1
one theory on why ' cult ' dramas perform so well on catch - up services is because fans re-watch the same episode multiple times the @entity33 episode of @entity7 was criticised for failing to answer questions about how the world 's most famous detective faked his own death in the final episode of the previous series			1
but that did n't stop it attracting over 10 million viewers during its initial broadcast , raising to 13 million when catch - up services are factored in			2
the popularity of catch - up services has been attributed to changing lifestyle habits , with people often choosing to use mobile phones or tablets to watch programmes on the move , rather than at home			2
now that services such as @entity55 's @entity9 , @entity14 and @entity56 's @entity57 are available as standard on the majority new television sets , the practice of the entire country settling down to watch a programme at the same time is increasingly unrealistic			0
top ratings : @entity68 's 2011 @entity67 special received 3.1 million views through @entity14			0
the 2012 version was almost as popular on the catch - up service , bringing in an extra 2.76 million viewers high ratings : the 2012 christmas eve special of @entity55 comedy @entity75 attracted 2.89 million viewers via catch - up , with a further 2.75million watching an episode from february 4 2013 many of the programmes with high post-broadcast viewing figures are so - called ' cult ' dramas , such as @entity85 and the aforementioned @entity7			1
although these programmes are incredibly popular and therefore naturally attract a large numbers of views , it is thought that their fans also tend to watch them during their initial broadcast , then re-watch one or more times through a catch - up service			1
contender : doctor who 's 50th anniversary special attracted an extra 2.62 million viewers on @entity9 speaking to the telegraph : @entity99 , the controller of @entity101 , said : ' i 'm very proud to have @entity7 on @entity101 and see it topping the charts as the biggest consolidated audience ever			2
it demonstrates that ambition and quality matter to our audience			0
' of the all time top 10 most watched programmes on a catch - up service , seven are programmes that first appeared on the @entity55			2
behind @entity7 and @entity68 , the 2012 call the @entity115 is in third place attracting a total of 2.92 additional viewers and 10.1million overall			0
the 2012 christmas eve special of @entity55 comedy @entity75 attracted 2.89 million catch - up viewers , with a further 2.75million watching an episode from february 4 2013			1
although the 2011 episode of @entity68 sits in second place , the 2012 version was almost as popular bringing in 2.76 million catch - up viewers , taking its total to 10.3 million			1
a surprise entry in the top 10 is the @entity55 's @entity133 episode of @entity134 , starring @entity135			0
the 2013 remake of the classic 70s sitcom had its viewing figures pushed up from 9.57million to 12.23 million by catch â€“ up			2
somewhat less surprising entries were doctor who 's 50th anniversary special , which attracted an extra 2.62 million viewers on @entity9 - taking the total to 12.8 million , and acclaimed dram @entity145 , which was watched an additional 2.45million times after first being shown			0
lord @entity149 , the @entity55 's director - general has previously stated that he says catch - up services as the future of television and radio			0
still attracting fans : a surprise entry in the top 10 is the @entity55 's @entity133 episode of @entity134 , starring @entity135			0
the 2013 remake of the classic 70s sitcom had total viewing figures of 12.23 million speaking about his plans for the @entity55 late last year , he said : ' no listener or viewer should ever have to feel a sense of powerless frustration that the @entity55 they want has succumbed to a @entity55 they did n't ask for , because in future individuals will have the ability to control the @entity55 themselves			0
' he added : ' the @entity55 you can have is catching up with the @entity55 you want ; there 's a fundamental shift happening			0
