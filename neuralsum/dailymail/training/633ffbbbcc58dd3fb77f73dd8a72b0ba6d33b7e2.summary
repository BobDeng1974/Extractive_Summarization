work has got under way to repaint the striking red and white stripes on a landmark lighthouse in @entity4			1
in a campaign backed by @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 , more than £ 27,000 was raised to pay for the revamp of the @entity10 in @entity11 , which has finally begun after a delay earlier in the week due to poor weather			1
the fundraising campaign was launched after @entity15 , which oversees shipping safety and navigational aids around @entity19 's coastline , said the lighthouse was no longer needed as a daymark - the reason for its eye - catching appearance			2
@entity23 : the @entity10 near @entity11 , @entity24 , is being repainted this week hard at work : engineers work at the top of the landmark to restore it to its former glory restoration : £ 27,000 was raised by campaigners , including @entity6 , to work on the lighthouse consequently , its distinctive stripes were to be left to fade because of the cost of repainting it			1
however , locals stepped in to raise the money needed to give it a fresh look			0
campaign co-ordinator @entity43 said : ' we have been thrilled by the support the campaign has received			0
' once we started it , we realised how many people have great affection for the lighthouse			0
' it 's a part of @entity24 , and in the end we received support from all over the world , including donations from @entity56 and @entity57			0
' the lighthouse has sat more than 500ft below the summit of the infamous chalk cliffs of @entity61 since being brought into service in 1902			0
supplies : paint and more equipment is brought by boat to the lighthouse yesterday before and after : the landmark had been looking increasingly grey , left , but today looked much brighter , right designed under the direction of sir @entity70 , the then engineer - in - chief of @entity15 , it is made of 3,660 tonnes of fine @entity74 granite			2
it was automated and de-manned in june 1983 and is monitored remotely 24 hours a day by @entity15 's operations and planning centre at @entity78 , @entity79			1
@entity15 has previously defended the decision not to repaint the lighthouse , saying it had a duty to ensure all its expenditure was justified			0
support : comedian @entity6 , left , and author @entity8 , right , gave money to the campaign back in time : a black and white image shows the lighthouse after it was built in 1902			1
