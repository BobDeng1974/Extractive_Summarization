by @entity0 @entity2 police have apologised to a one - armed cyclist after they pulled him over and fined him for riding one - handed			0
@entity4 was travelling through @entity6 city centre when he was stopped by overzealous officer who told him he was riding dangerously			1
upon realising mr @entity4 was missing an arm , the overzealous officer turned his attention to the customised bicycle , fining him € 25 for having adapted his brakes to work off a single lever - despite the fact doing so was perfectly legal			1
ridiculous : one - armed @entity4 was travelling through @entity6 city centre when he was stopped by overzealous officers who pulled him over and fined him for riding one - handed reports of mr @entity4 's unusual legal issue made national news in @entity2 this week , and he has since had his fine cancelled and received a full apology from @entity6 's police			1
the officers originally claimed his bicycle breached @entity2 safety standards by not having two hand brake levers , as mr @entity4 had moved so it could be activated using his foot			2
after a 25 minute argument with the officer at the side of the road - during which he claims the officer also incorrectly accused him of not having legally required lights on his bicycle - mr @entity4 reluctantly paid the fine as he was running late for a meeting at work			1
but research by the @entity41 newspaper revealed that the modifications mr @entity4 made to his bicycle - which meant he still had two working brakes - ensured it remained roadworthy			2
sorry : reports of mr @entity4 's unusual legal issue made national news in @entity2 this week , and he has since had his fine cancelled and received a full apology from @entity6 's police although mr @entity4 says he has complained about his treatment and reported the officers for discrimination , police officials claim they were only made aware of the issue when he took his story to the newspaper			1
they say that as soon as they realised the matter needed correcting , administrators contacted mr @entity4 to apologise and offer him a refund			0
there was an initial dispute over how much that refund would be - the police claimed only € 5 of the € 25 was for the brake level , saying the remaining € 20 was punishment for the apparently faulty light			2
but when mr @entity4 was able to prove that his light worked off a dynamo powered by his pedals , rather than a battery , a full refund was agreed			0
speaking to @entity41 , he said he was relieved that the fine had finally been dropped			0
' it 's great news , i 'm really happy , ' he said , adding that the incident had been weighing on him over the past weeks , leaving him frustrated and feeling discriminated against			0
' it 's good that this is how it ends , it 's unbelievably good , he said .			0
