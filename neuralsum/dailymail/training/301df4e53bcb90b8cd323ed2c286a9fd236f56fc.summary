by @entity1 reporter published : 07:25 est , 6 august 2013 updated : 08:03 est , 7 august 2013 having taken part in 40 flying missions during the war , @entity2 was delighted when he heard that a special @entity7 medal was to be awarded to those who risked their lives over @entity10			1
but now the 89 - year - old has been told he does not qualify – because the bombers he flew in took off from @entity13 instead of @entity14			1
‘ i am very disappointed , ’ he said yesterday			0
‘ it should n’t make any difference where people were based			0
@entity19 airmen who served as crew should be recognised in the same way			0
it is not just for myself but for those brave men we lost			0
’ wireless operator @entity2 , 89 , pictured with other medals he has won , has been told he 's not eligible for a @entity27 as he was based in @entity13 mr @entity2 was a wireless operator in @entity19 @entity29 and @entity31 bombers between april 1944 and the end of the war , attacking @entity35 lines in @entity13 and heavily - defended airfields in @entity37 and @entity38			1
he also helped to supply partisans in @entity40			0
he was among hundreds of @entity19 crew based in @entity13 with the @entity42			1
a great - grandfather , mr @entity2 said : ‘ we were fighting the same war and were over enemy territory up against the same opposition and fighter planes			1
when people flew off on missions you never knew if you would see them again – and every time you went out you were aware that you might not come back			0
pictured as an 18 - year - old , mr @entity2 flew 40 missions on @entity29 bombers in @entity56 ‘ there was a memorial to @entity7 inaugurated by the @entity61 in @entity62 last year			1
does this ruling by the @entity58 mean the memorial does n’t recognise the people who , like me , flew out from bases outside @entity14 ? there does n’t seem to be any logic to their thinking			2
’ mr @entity2 , from @entity69 , @entity70 , served with @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
he applied earlier this year for the new @entity27 but was turned down and lost an appeal to try to get the @entity75 to reverse the decision			1
his mp @entity77 has now taken up his case			0
he said : ‘ this is stupid bureaucracy			0
all those who served as aircrew should be remembered in the same way			2
‘ if it was n’t for the courage of men like mr @entity2 then we would probably still be living under a dictatorship			1
‘ either the eligibility criteria for the @entity27 should be extended to those who flew under the command of @entity42 or they should have their own clasp			0
’ a spokesman for the @entity58 said it was awaiting the conclusions of an independent medal review , ‘ so we would be unable to comment on this issue further ’			0
working as a wireless operator on @entity29 bombers like this one , front , @entity2 flew 40 missions the @entity103 star medal , for those who served in the @entity105 , and the @entity27 beneath it designed to be worn on the ribbon of the @entity108 , the @entity27 is granted to the aircrew of @entity7 who served for at least 60 days , or completed a tour of operations , on a @entity7 operational unit and flew at least one operational sortie on a @entity7 operational unit between september 3 1939 and may 8 1945			1
members of @entity7 aircrew who died , were taken prisoner or were wounded before they could complete the requirements are still eligible , as are foreign nationals who were commissioned into the @entity14 or @entity122			2
those who believe they are eligible for the award , details of which were announced in february this year , or their next of kin , can apply to the @entity58 for the @entity27			2
last month a @entity56 veteran who flew over @entity130 was told he was ineligible for the @entity27 because his service was eight days too short			1
@entity132 , 89 , of @entity133 , @entity134 , was a gunner with @entity7 from march 18 1945 until the @entity35 surrendered on may 8 of that year			0
he had served for 52 days - short of the 60 required by the @entity27 eligibility criteria - and so his application and subsequent appeal were turned down by the @entity138			2
mr @entity132 , who holds the @entity139 1935 - 1945 and @entity140 , said : ' it 's a nonsense and it 's nit - picking			0

@entity2 , 89 , from @entity69 , was based in @entity13 during the war
he worked as a wireless operator on *deadly* missions flying over @entity10
@entity14 *government* introduced @entity27 this year for aircrew
mr @entity2 told he 's ineligible as served under @entity153 forces
