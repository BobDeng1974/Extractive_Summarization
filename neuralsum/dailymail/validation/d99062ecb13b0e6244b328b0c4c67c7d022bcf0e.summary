@entity1 's only previous visit to @entity2 came as a wide - eyed 10 - year - old when his footballing father @entity4 secured tickets for a game against @entity7 from @entity8 , a former team - mate who had signed for @entity9			1
among the players on view were @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14			0
' it left a great impression on me , ' said @entity1			1
' as a young boy from @entity19 who loved football , i just took everything in			0
the crowd noise and atmosphere were crazy			0
it was a special day			0
' at lunchtime on sunday , @entity25 will return to @entity2 for the first time with his new @entity29 team - mates			1
this year 's clash carries even greater significance than usual with a @entity34 place at stake and for @entity25 it carries on the family tradition of being involved in big matches			1
@entity1 ( right ) will play at @entity2 for the first time with @entity29 on sunday afternoon @entity1 is enjoying his time in @entity40 but admits he had to adapt to the pace of the @entity42 the 25 - year - old scores his first goal for @entity29 to salvage a 2 - 2 draw against @entity45 in october last year his father played 42 times for @entity19 and was captain of @entity50 's legendary 1995 @entity34 - winning side alongside @entity51 , @entity52 and @entity53			1
it was a first major triumph for an emerging manager called @entity56 who clearly likes the @entity25 family			1
almost two decades later , he selected @entity58 for @entity19 's @entity60 team last summer and then signed him for @entity29 in a £ 14million deal from @entity50			1
it has been an eventful debut in the @entity42 for both of them			1
@entity29 's results have been far better than last season when they finished seventh under @entity67			1
they visit @entity2 having lost just twice in 19 league games			1
at the same time , their performances until last weekend 's 3 - 0 victory against @entity73 had been patchy with new signings like @entity75 and @entity76 struggling			1
blind has been a steadying influence , his versatility useful as @entity81 has tried to juggle injuries and suspensions			1
the 25 - year - old has been used mostly as a holding midfielder but with @entity87 returning last weekend , he switched to left back as @entity29 turned in their best performance of the season			1
@entity1 says his manager is essentially the same person in @entity91 as when he took @entity19 to the @entity60 semi-final			1
blind talks with his dad , @entity19 coach @entity4 , during a training session at last summer 's @entity60 in @entity96 the @entity19 international believes he is similar to his dad when out on the football pitch @entity25 , pictured alongside @entity76 , was one of a number of summer signings made by @entity56 blind screams with delight after curling the ball into the bottom corner of @entity108 's net at the @entity109 ' people only think he 's intimidating because he is honest			1
he is honest to people , ' explained @entity1			1
' yeah , sometimes the truth can be hard to some players or people			0
but i really like that in a person and especially in a manager			2
' every player knows their job , what they have to do in training and matches			0
it is very clear and i think that makes everything a bit easier for players			0
as a team we believe in his philosophy			0
' it is a good feeling for a player if you know where you stand			0
sometimes it can be a bit frightening when somebody is really honest but i think it is positive			2
i do n't get any special treatment , definitely not			0
i make mistakes , too , and i try to learn when he says something			0
it can look as if he is angry but he is trying to make you better			0
he does that from a football perspective , it 's not personal			2
he treats everybody the same			0
' in keeping with @entity29 's season , @entity25 has experienced highs and lows			1
a knee injury that kept him out for six weeks in the autumn was frustrating			0
when fit , he has weighed in with important goals at @entity45 and @entity160 and last week was vital in the @entity73 win , with @entity161 and @entity162 unavailable			0
it was seen as a return to the old , swashbuckling @entity29			1
blind does n't think it 's that simple			1
he believes @entity29 did n't change their approach much , the major difference was getting two early goals			1
@entity29 boss @entity56 has tried to implement his own philosophy at @entity172 this season @entity56 is pictured with @entity173 and @entity50 chairman @entity174 back in 1994 blind , pictured in action against @entity73 , has proved his versatility under @entity81 this season @entity173 leads his son out during his @entity50 days ( left ) and lifts the @entity34 trophy in 1995 the @entity180 looks dejected alongside @entity181 and @entity182 during defeat by @entity184 ' everything came together			1
we tried to play attacking football			0
but there were still moments we used @entity190 to switch play or had to show patience			0
but of course when you are leading 3 - 0 at half time it is a lot easier because the fans are excited			2
i think we have played better and better in recent weeks , against @entity73 maybe we did it for longer			0
' the cries of ' attack , attack ' heard from @entity29 fans this season are meant to lift the players			1
but @entity1 says the team have to use their heads in matches , too			1
' of course , you go on the pitch feeling you want to win			2
every game is difficult in the @entity42 , you have to be also smart in the games			1
' sometimes you need to have composure			0
against @entity73 , we attacked them in the first half			0
then in the second half , we let them come at us a bit more and played from there			0
i think we can play different styles			0
' that adaptability is one of the reasons @entity81 signed @entity25 rather than any other member of his @entity180 @entity60 squad			1
he has proved invaluable in a season where @entity29 have suffered an unprecedented number of injuries and said : ' i think i am a player who can switch really fast in my mind			1
for me , it is not an issue where to play			0
i know what you have to do in each position			0
i think it is an advantage for me			0
' blind has been particularly impressed with @entity29 's travelling support since joining the club blind ( back row , second from right ) left @entity50 for @entity172 in a £ 14million deal late last summer the former @entity50 man was a key part of @entity81 's squad as @entity19 reached the @entity60 semi-finals @entity173 and his son pose in front of @entity253 in @entity254 during the @entity255 in @entity96 @entity81 described @entity58 's father as the best leader he 's ever had — some claim when he has managed at @entity259 and @entity260			1
@entity58 says he has inherited characteristics from both parents			1
' i think on the pitch i am more like my dad			2
calm and thinking about stuff			0
off the pitch with my friends , i am more like my mum			2
she says things straight away , very direct			0
i can speak sometimes without thinking			0
' i was five when my dad won the @entity34			1
i ca n't remember watching it live on the television but , growing up , i saw all the videos and dreamed it might be me one day			0
i am proud of his achievements and proud to carry the name blind			2
' i guess i must have seen @entity56 as a boy when i 'd go to watch my father train but i ca n't remember anything specific			1
i first got to know him with the @entity180 team			2
' when @entity56 tells me things , i think it might be the same advice he used to give my father ! ' @entity58 and @entity4 also work together with their national team where @entity4 is a coach and tipped to be manager			1
' sometimes i prefer to speak to the other trainers , ' laughs the younger blind			2
' if he 's close by , i might whisper " @entity291 "			2
the other players think it 's funny , they accept it			2
' @entity4 is also a regular visitor to watch his son play at @entity172 but wo n't be at @entity2 on sunday afternoon			1
@entity1 netted another late equaliser for @entity29 in their 1 - 1 draw at @entity160 in february @entity298 celebrates with his team - mate blind after his crucial strike at @entity301 @entity1 only knew compatriot @entity302 and @entity303 before he joined @entity29 last summer off the field , @entity58 has settled in well and chosen to live in a city - centre apartment rather than a sprawling footballers ' wives pad in @entity308			1
' i like people around me and everything within walking distance , ' he says			0
' occasionally people want to take a picture on the street but that 's not a problem			2
i liked @entity316 and i like @entity40 , they suit me			0
' it also gives @entity25 peace of mind that his girlfriend is in a safe environment when he is away with the @entity29 squad			2
for someone who knew only two of @entity29 's players when he arrived — national team - mate @entity302 and youngster @entity303 , who started his career in @entity19 — @entity25 has acclimatised well			1
one of his social objectives is to try to find time to restart golf lessons			0
he has been in @entity91 nearly eight months now			2
' the best thing for me is the amount of away fans that follow @entity29			2
the stands are always full , it was a big surprise when i first saw that , ' he said			0
' on the pitch , the pace and power of matches was new for me , box - to - box			2
my first game at home to @entity346 was n't the quickest but i still felt more tired than after any @entity50 match			0
when we played at @entity349 and had a red card ( @entity351 ) , wow , the intensity but i think i coped well			0
' if a problem does arise , his manager is an important safety net			2
' he is personal , any player can always reach him if they want to , ' he says			0
and the result when @entity1 visited @entity2 just over 14 years ago ? @entity9 lost 2 - 1			1
a repeat on sunday would leave @entity29 with one foot firmly in the @entity34			1
like father , like son .			0

@entity1 and @entity29 take on @entity9 at @entity2 on sunday
the @entity180 says he likes manager @entity56 's honest style
@entity81 led @entity58 's father , @entity4 , to the @entity34 in 1995
the 25 - year - old believes he is similar to his dad when out on the pitch
blind has settled in @entity91 well and loves playing in the @entity42
