by @entity0 for @entity1 how many sofas can you fit in the back of a tiny @entity5 ? none - as this family eventually found out			1
this hilarious video shows a determined trio trying to shoehorn a huge sofa into the back of their mid- 90s @entity5			1
the hapless attempts , which went on for more than three minutes , saw the family flip the sofa into several different positions , before repeatedly ramming the furniture into the boot			1
the footage was filmed by @entity35 , 44 , who recorded the scene from his bedroom window in @entity38 , @entity48			1
after filming for a few minutes , he raced downstairs to try and get a closer look			1
but , by the time he got downstairs , the family - consisting of two women , the driver and two children - had gone			1
he said : ' i can only think that they drove off with the sofa wedged in the back			0
' mr @entity35 posted the clip on @entity59 and , within days , it went viral			1
it now has more than 62,000 shares			0
after several failed attempts , one of the group had a brainwave - to remove the cushions from the sofa but , unsurprisingly , the giant piece of furniture still would not squeeze into the miniature car flipping the sofa upside down - for about the twelfth time - did n't help the problem , either mr @entity35 raised downstairs to try and get a closer look , but they had driven off by the time he got there			1
he said : ' i can only think they drove off with the sofa wedged in the back ' he said : ' it ’s just crazy how many people have seen it			0
on sunday my neighbours put the sofa on their drive and on monday afternoon i saw these people trying to put it in the car			2
' i thought there is no was they are going to get that in , so i started filming			0
i had to stifle my laughter as i watched them trying to wedge it in			0
' i filmed for a few minutes and then i thought i ’m going to go downstairs and keep filming			2
at this point they had wedged the sofa in the back of car			2
' there were two women , two children and the driver who had all driven up together , so it was a pretty full car already			0
' it probably went on for about five minutes and by the time i had rushed down the stairs to carry on filming they had gone			2
' i just ca n’t believe how many people have seen it			0
but it is really funny			0

@entity35 , 44 , filmed the scene from his bedroom window in @entity38
it shows the family repeatedly trying to shove the sofa into their mid- 90s car
the woman even removes the sofa *'s* cushions - but that does n't help either
mr @entity35 raced downstairs to carry on filming , but they had *disappeared*
