ever wanted a job that will advance the course of human history while also let you drive a @entity5 tractor ? then @entity6 has the perfect opening for you			1
the private space company founded by @entity10 , the co-founder of @entity11 , is advertising to fill a rather unusual role - a farmer with some rather lofty ambitions			1
in a job advert that conjures up images of @entity18 ’s farming space explorer in the film @entity19 , @entity6 says it is looking for a farmer with a rare mix of ‘ drive , passion , scrappiness , intelligence and curiosity to seek what ’s beyond the stars ’			1
rather than taking a key role producing food on the first colony on @entity47 , they will instead be harvesting crops on the land around the company ’s 900 acre rocket base in @entity34 , @entity35			1
@entity6 insists , however , that the successful candidate will play a ‘ direct role in advancing the course of human history ’ and will join a team whose aim is to ‘ pave the way to @entity47 ’			1
headed with the title ‘ @entity61 ’ , the job advert says candidates will need at least 10 years of experience of crop farming and have detailed knowledge @entity5 machinery			1
the job description also warns that anyone who is successful will be need to work ‘ extremely flexible ’ hours and will be exposed to environments that involve dirt , odours , noise and weather extremes ‘ or similar elements ’ through most of their working day			0
applicants will also need to be able to climb ladders , work in tight spaces and lift objects of up to 50lbs			2
the advert says : ‘ this is @entity6			1
we are not like most companies			0
our goal is to do what has never before been done - enabling mankind to live on other planets			0
‘ we push the boundaries of what is currently possible , and understand it takes rare individuals to help us make this happen			0
@entity18 plays a farmer who dreams of leaving @entity95 for space in @entity98 's bleak film on the future of our planet @entity19 , but the @entity6 role is unlikely to involve much spaceflight ‘ we celebrate our successes , and each other			1
we seek future colleagues with a rare mix of drive , passion , scrappiness , intelligence , and curiosity to seek what ’s beyond the stars			2
‘ playing a direct role in advancing the course of human history is no small endeavor			1
join us , and find your place in the @entity6 legacy			2
’ @entity124 's @entity123 experiment uses a low - cost plant growth chamber that features a flat panel of led lights			0
these produce red , blue and green light to allow the plants to grow			0
lettuce and radish seeds were placed inside specially designed prototype ' flight pillows ' to help encourage their growth , which were then placed on root mats			0
the pillows were made from @entity139 - coated @entity138 and @entity140 , which contained soil , clay and fertilizer pellets			0
water was then added to the root mat to begin seed germination and this is then carefully controlled as the plants grow			0
the growth chamber also features bellows to help regulate air flow over the plants and maintain the correct humidity			0
astronauts on board the @entity156 have been monitoring the seedlings since they arrived in april for health , size , the amount of water they use and microorganisms growing on them			0
@entity6 was founded in 2002 by @entity10 to build private rockets and spacecraft			1
in 2008 it put the first privately funded rocket into orbit and then in 2012 its @entity168 spacecraft became the first private mission to deliver cargo to the @entity156			2
@entity124 , which has seen its own launch capacity dented by budget cuts , has turned to @entity6 to help supplies to the space station			2
it has also awarded @entity6 a share of a contract with @entity177 to develop a ' space taxi ' that will carry @entity180 astronauts into orbit			2
@entity6 now employs more than 3,000 people in its headquarters in @entity184 , @entity185 , and facilities in @entity187 , @entity35 and @entity188 , @entity188 while most people involved in the space industry tend to be scientists and engineers , @entity6 is now seeking employees with more earth based experience			1
they want farmers with a minimum of 10 years of row crop farming experience in the central @entity35 area and a working knowledge of ' every process required for crop production in the region '			1
candidates also need experience in repairing and maintaining @entity5 agricultural equipment			1
their responsibilities will include planning farm production , increasing the quality of crop yields , making contingency plans for variable weather conditions and using electronic spreadsheets			0
but they warn that the farmer will be required to work around test launch schedules at the @entity218 facility , where @entity6 carries out research and development on its @entity222 rockets			1
the advert says : ' this position will be required to work around test schedules as necessary to ensure the successful crop production does not interfere with testing progress			0
' this may be no small task - recent tests of @entity6 's @entity232 rocket saw the 106 feet tall rocket ' hop ' 330 feet to the side			1
however , @entity6 is not the first space organisation to dabble in agriculture			2
@entity124 has been developing technologies to allow astronauts to grow food on the iss and in the space shuttle			0
in april this year @entity124 sent its @entity242 ( @entity243 ) to the @entity156 on board @entity168 cargo vessel			0
it will be used in an experiment , called @entity123 , to see how red romaine lettuce grows in the low gravity environment of space			0
@entity6 carried @entity124 's veggie experiment to the @entity156 in april where it is being used to grow red romaine lettuce inside the bellows of a specially designed prototype ' flight pillow '			2

@entity10 's private space *venture* has placed an advert for a farmer to work at its rocket research and development site in @entity34 , @entity35
@entity6 says candidates will help advance the course of human history
applicants need 10 years farming experience , an *ability* to repair @entity5 agricultural *vehicles* and ' curiosity to seek what 's beyond the stars '
