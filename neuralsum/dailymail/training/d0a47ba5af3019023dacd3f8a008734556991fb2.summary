in this land of fire and ice , where the fog - shrouded lava fields offer a spooky landscape in which anything might lurk , stories abound of the ' hidden folk ' - thousands of elves , making their homes in @entity11 's wilderness			1
so perhaps it was only a matter of time before 21st - century elves got political representation			2
elf advocates have joined forces with environmentalists to urge the @entity19 and @entity20 and local authorities to abandon a highway project building a direct route from the tip of the @entity26 peninsula , where the president has a home , to the @entity30 suburb of @entity31			1
they fear disturbing elf habitat and claim the area is particularly important because it contains an elf church			0
land of mystery : a highway connecting @entity31 in @entity30 to the @entity38 in @entity11 has been put on hold because of protests about the environmental and cultural impact - including affect it could have on local elves			1
pictured is one of the few huts along the @entity48 trail the project has been halted until the @entity51 rules on a case brought by a group known as @entity54 , who cite both the environmental and the cultural impact - including the impact on elves - of the road project			1
the group has regularly brought hundreds of people out to block the bulldozers			0
and it 's not the first time issues about ' @entity64 ' , @entity19 for ' hidden folk ' , have affected planning decisions			2
they occur so often that the road and coastal administration has come up with a stock media response for elf inquiries , which states in part that ' issues have been settled by delaying the construction project at a certain point while the elves living there have supposedly moved on '			1
@entity79 folklore is full of elves , trolls and other mythological characters			2
most people in @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 have n't taken them seriously since the 19th century , but elves are no joke to many in @entity11 , which has a population of 320,000			1
a survey conducted by the @entity93 in 2007 found that some 62 per cent of the 1,000 respondents thought it was at least possible that elves exist			1
@entity96 , a self - proclaimed ' seer ' , believes she can communicate with the creatures through telepathy			0
' it will be a terrible loss and damaging both for the elf world and for us humans , ' said @entity96 of the road project			1
the @entity51 of @entity11 will rule on whether the highway project should go ahead after friends of @entity107 protested against the plans though many of the @entity54 are motivated primarily by environmental concerns , they see the elf issue as part of a wider concern for the history and culture of the very unique landscape			1
@entity117 , a well - known environmentalist , said his major concern was that the road would cut the lava field in two , among other things , destroying nesting sites			2
' some feel that the elf thing is a bit annoying , ' said @entity117 , adding that personally he was not sure they existed			0
however , he added : ' i got married in a church with a god just as invisible as the elves , so what might seem irrational is actually quite common ' with @entity11			1
@entity131 , a folklore professor at the @entity93 , said he was not surprised by the wide acceptance of the possibility of elves			2
' this is a land where your house can be destroyed by something you ca n't see ( earthquakes ) , where the wind can knock you off your feet , where the smell of sulfur from your taps tells you there is invisible fire not far below your feet , where the northern lights make the sky the biggest television screen in the world , and where hot springs and glaciers ` talk , ' @entity131 said			0
' in short , everyone is aware that the land is alive , and one can say that the stories of hidden people and the need to work carefully with them reflects an understanding that the land demands respect			0
' @entity131 said similar beliefs are found in western @entity164 , but they thrive in @entity11 because people remain in close contact with the land			1
parents still let their children play out in the wilderness - often late into the night			0
vast pristine areas remain , even near the capital , @entity30			1
@entity174 : there are still vast , untouched areas of land in @entity11 , even near the capital @entity30 , which is believed to be one of the reasons many residents still believe in ancient folklore and at @entity182 , @entity11 await not just one @entity183 , but 13 trolls known as the ' @entity185 ' who come to town during the 13 days before @entity182 , each with his own task , putting rewards or punishments into the shoes of little children			1
they include @entity193 , or @entity194 , who is extremely short and eats crusts left in pans ; @entity197 , or @entity198 , who snatches leftovers ; and @entity200 or @entity201 , who likes to slam doors at night			0
' if you ask an @entity11 about elves , they might say they do n't believe , ' said @entity96			1
' but we always have stories of them , if not from ourselves then from someone close like a family member			0
of course , not everyone believes in the stories , but the stories and the elves are still there and being told			2
' @entity217 , a writer in @entity30 , fondly remembers a story his grandmother told him about a mischievous elf			2
' she told me about ( a pair ) of her scissors that went missing and she was certain that an elf borrowed them , ' @entity217 said			0
' she would not believe that they were just lost and she would not buy ( new ) scissors			0
she said the elf would give them back when he was finished			0
she said they were returned			0
' one of @entity11 's most famous daughters , the singer @entity233 , had no hesitation in responding when asked by @entity237 comedian and tv host @entity238 if people in her country believed in elves			1
' we do , ' she said			0
' it 's sort of a relationship with nature , like with the rocks			2
( the elves ) all live in the rocks , so you have to			0
it 's all about respect , you know			0

friends of @entity107 are *campaigning* against the new road from the @entity26 peninsular to @entity31 in @entity30
they have raised concerns about both the environmental and cultural impact
this includes the potential impact on elves along the route
project has been halted until @entity51 can rule on the case
a recent survey in @entity11 found 62 *%* believe it 's possible that elves exist
