optimism swept around @entity1 last summer but @entity3 ’s campaign is delicately poised as they prepare for an @entity5 showdown with @entity6			1
a run of four consecutive defeats — their worst sequence of results since december 2005 — has been a great cause for concern and , for the first time in his reign , @entity7 finds his managerial methods questioned and scrutinised			1
confidence crisis @entity18 back to @entity3 ’s opening fixtures against @entity20 and @entity21 in august			1
they were slick in both games and should have taken maximum points but conceded late goals to draw twice			2
that set the tone for them in the @entity29			2
@entity3 have disappointed considering their performances last season and investment during the summer @entity7 has found himself under scrutiny for the first time since taking charge at @entity3 they have struggled for fluency and @entity7 feels the goals against @entity20 and @entity21 inflicted psychological wounds that are yet to heal			1
the nadir was reached in last week ’s dreadful performance at @entity42			0
‘ those four points we lost really made it very difficult , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ when i say difficult , i mean you are afraid of making a mistake and then you make it			0
when you play with freedom and you ’re on top of your game , those aspects do n’t get punished			0
’ why ca n’t they keep fit ? @entity7 was asked for an injury bulletin at the start of monday ’s press conference and reeled off a succession of experienced names that included @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 and , most significantly , @entity64			1
the @entity65 international — @entity3 ’s standout performer — is again sidelined with hamstring damage and that injury has afflicted a number of players , including @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 this season			1
@entity77 scores a last - gasp equaliser for @entity21 against @entity3 during their clash at @entity1 a number of key players for @entity3 , including @entity74 ( pictured ) , have struggled to stay fit this season @entity3 , unusually , only played five games in pre-season , leading to claims , which @entity7 refuted , that they were under - cooked			1
there has been upheaval behind the scenes recently with @entity88 , the respected head of medicine , leaving abruptly			0
no case for the defence perhaps the most surprising aspect about @entity3 is how easily breached they are			1
they have conceded 33 times , the same tally as bottom club @entity20			0
only @entity95 ( 35 ) have conceded more			0
they have only kept six clean sheets from the 27 matches they have played in all competitions — their last shutout was against @entity101 on november 27 — and what has concerned @entity7 is the fact they were unable to muster a response against @entity42			1
‘ we can see the goals we conceded are not up to the standard we want , ’ he accepted			0
but as a team it is only against @entity42 i felt the goal , when it went in it , affected us too much			2
the way we conceded and how it affected us is something very rare			0
’ @entity114 has played well when fit , but maintaining fitness has been an issue for the young midfielder @entity118 has struggled to reproduce the form that saw @entity3 pay £ 28m for him during the summer the two young hopes @entity7 claimed he would have paid £ 100million to sign @entity118 in the summer			1
he ultimately got him for £ 28m but the @entity122 ’s performance have lacked swagger and in some games he has been anonymous			0
@entity114 , meanwhile , has not made the impact expected because of injuries and failing to play in a settled position			1
he has been stationed , puzzlingly , at times on the flank when he is more potent through the middle			0
@entity131 it was said when @entity7 arrived 18 months ago the atmosphere at @entity134 , the club ’s training retreat , lifted and the positivity certainly played its part in helping @entity3 come within a whisker of @entity141 qualification			1
the downturn in results — coupled with the punishing schedule of @entity146 football — means the mood is not as vibrant , though @entity72 recently made a point of emphasising the squad is ‘ massively behind ’ @entity7			2
the @entity1 crowd is capable of giving its team tremendous backing but , if they turn , the stadium can be an unforgiving venue ; there were growls of frustration when they beat @entity95 3 - 0 last month			2
‘ the atmosphere at @entity1 has only been a little bit shaky because of our expectations , ’ said @entity7			2
‘ i think now the crowd understands we are in a difficult position and that we have to help each other			0
’ dealing with pressure one of @entity7 ’s strengths is not getting flustered , either by the sequence of results or the focus on his position			2
he is also certain in his methods and will not resort to changing his tactics for the sake of a quick fix			0
‘ the truth is that i feel under the same pressure when we win and when we lose because i always look forward , ’ he said			0
‘ my vision is to create a winning team			2
losing games forces you to try and find solutions , to look inside in a different way than when you win			0
’ aside from that , there is also a strong relationship with chairman @entity187			0
‘ he is an @entity3 and really cares about the club — results are paramount , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ the support i got from day one has been incredible and really helps in moments like the one we are experiencing now			0
’ @entity3 's fans were heard booing during their side 's 3 - 0 victory against @entity95 at @entity1 @entity7 admitted the support of chairman @entity187 has helped him in the more difficult moments			1

@entity3 are struggling and have lost each of their last four matches
@entity118 has struggled to reproduce his form from last season
@entity114 has played well but has been *plagued* by fitness *problems*
@entity7 admitted his team are suffering mentally
