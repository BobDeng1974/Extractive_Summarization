the huge build - up to @entity3 women 's under 19 replay against @entity4 was truly bizarre and unprecedented			1
and it was a game only supposed to last for 18 seconds			2
@entity6 held incredible nerve to retake a penalty which she ought to have taken on saturday , were it not for @entity11 referee @entity10 ' terrific blunder			1
@entity10 disallowed @entity6 's penalty for encroachment from @entity3 players at the weekend , but instead of ordering her back to the spot , awarded a free - kick to @entity4			1
@entity6 ( centre ) stepped up again to take the penalty during the 18 - second rematch against @entity4 @entity6 went the same way as her successful spot - kick last saturday and found the net once again @entity24 goalkeeper @entity23 was unable to stop @entity6 's brilliant effort the @entity3 captain wheels away in celebration after handing her side a crucial 2 - 2 draw but @entity3 were given a lifeline when @entity32 chiefs ruled it should be replayed			1
all match details from saturday , including the time of day the penalty was awarded , the venue , the players who were on the pitch , were ticked off by the @entity39 blazers and the game was restarted at 9.45pm			2
and that was a whole five hours after both had played their final @entity44 games in @entity45			0
only @entity10 was replaced , by referee @entity46			0
it began in what would have been the 96th minute , and ended 65 seconds later			1
@entity6 said : ' they were the longest 24 hours of my life , i had n't slept			2
i think i was just excited , i went through so many emotions and just felt excitement , so i thought ' yep , that 's how i am going to feel ' ! ' we had a conversation just before i came out which was quite emotional , we have been through a bigger journey than some people go through in their whole careers because of what happened , it was never about me , it was about the team			0
the @entity3 players celebrate @entity6 's penalty which earned them a 2 - 2 draw in @entity66 @entity3 held on in the final moments to secure the draw and , with it , a place in this summer 's finals in @entity71 @entity6 blows a kiss to the crowd as @entity75 's side look ahead to this summer 's tournament number of seconds played : 65.18 after the players returned to the centre circle number of @entity3 players on the pitch : @entity4 were already down to 10 outfield players , but @entity3 brought on a sub to replace one injured in the game vs @entity86 days between spot - kicks : five days between saturday 's clash and the controversial rematch number of goals scored : 1 - the infamous penalty ' when something is taken away from you like that , you realise just how much you want it , and that 's what happened			1
qualifying is such a huge deal for us , it 's massive			0
' @entity4 discovered minutes before the penalty was retaken they would qualify for the july finals in @entity71 , as best runners - up across all @entity44 groups			1
had the penalty been missed , @entity4 would have finished table - toppers , and the @entity110 would have progressed as best second - placed team			2
it was the most surreal football you could imagine , starting from the penalty spot , with none of the regular pomp of a competitive international , yet much more attention than a girls ' game normally yields			0
under - age women 's games in @entity45 , if the passionate hosts are n't playing , are usually lucky to attract treble figures			0
@entity3 are awarded a penalty during their @entity126 qualifier on saturday referee @entity127 points to the spot as @entity3 are awarded a penalty in the 96th minute @entity6 steps up to take a penalty in the closing stages of the match against @entity4 in @entity66 @entity6 runs forward to strike the ball but team - mate @entity134 ( circled ) has entered the box @entity6 turns and celebrates as she slots the ball into the goalkeeper 's bottom - right corner @entity11 referee @entity127 officiating a women 's @entity141 match in @entity143 last month @entity3 players celebrate after they thought they had equalised against @entity4 but referee @entity10 awards an indirect free - kick and the celebrations are cut short @entity6 has the ball back in her hands ready for what she thought would be a retake while the disgraced @entity153 , who was sent home after her blunder , will be keen to shelve her nightmare , @entity6 's name will crop up in pub quizzes for generations			1
@entity3 coach @entity75 said : ' obviously the tournament has been tough and pretty much it 's about following through in the right way			2
we are happy we gave ourselves a chance to qualify and everything has turned out the way we wanted it , for @entity4 as well			0
' i know how hard these players have worked , credit to all of the other teams , and credit to @entity4 , we deserve to be in the finals			0
' it 's ironic because a lot of the hard work we did at the start of the week was about a long journey , handling the intense pressure of a tournament and tests to our resolve , which helped a lot			0
but @entity6 then realises the referee 's decision and two @entity24 players are seen celebrating @entity11 referee @entity153 is understood to have been sent home following her error on saturday ' everyone was aware of the possible outcomes , we may not have scored the penalty , we know that			1
' we may not have got through			0
but we are just so tremendously happy			0
' since this odd chain of events stemmed from an infringement of the game 's laws , @entity32 's disciplinary committee did exactly the right thing in instructing for it to be replayed			1
but it sets a dangerous precedent			0
@entity3 's appeal cost just Â£ 750 , which is repayable to the @entity202 as it was successful , but was it lodged just because it 's arguably a lower level of football ? it triggers questions concerning how many more appeals of this nature could happen in the future			2
in a men 's senior @entity3 international , one presumes one of the tens of thousands of people would correct the referee , whereas perhaps the same ca n't be guaranteed with a three - figure crowd			1
indeed , would you have that inexcusable refereeing in the first place ? september 2005 - @entity220 qualifier - @entity218 vs @entity221 @entity218 had won the opening leg of the @entity224 zone fourth - round play - off 1 - 0 at home but were left incensed after a penalty was disallowed in the 38th minute for an attacking player encroaching			1
rather than retaking the penalty , an indirect free - kick was wrongly awarded by @entity232 referee @entity231 to @entity221 and the game ended with a one - goal margin			1
@entity218 called for an investigation but were left furious after @entity236 ordered the match to be replayed in its entirety with the result declared invalid			0
it proved to have a major impact as it was @entity221 who eventually went through with a 1 - 1 away goals victory , though they were later beaten in the @entity247 - @entity246 play - off			2
@entity221 staff and players celebrate after beating @entity218 in an @entity224 @entity220 qualifier in 2005			0

@entity6 reveals she could n't sleep ahead of crucial penalty retake as @entity3 earn 2 - 2 against @entity4
@entity75 's side qualify for @entity255 in @entity71
@entity32 ordered the final 18 seconds of the qualifier to be replayed after a refereeing mistake
referee @entity127 incorrectly awarded an indirect free - kick to @entity4 for encroachment after disallowing @entity3 's penalty on saturday
@entity3 were 2 - 1 down to @entity4 at the time in the 96th minute
@entity11 @entity153 , *28* , has been sent home following her error
it is the first time ever that a decision like this has been taken by @entity32
