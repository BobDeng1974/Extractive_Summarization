by @entity0 and @entity1 it is not often you are granted an audience with @entity6 's representative on @entity7			0
but it seems actor @entity9 , a self - confessed former user of prostitutes and cocaine , was not meeting @entity12 to ask for his sins to be absolved			1
@entity9 - who was notorious for his tangled love life , penchant for lap - dancers and taste for @entity19 drugs - had travelled to the @entity20 for a meeting with the head of the @entity23 to promote his latest movie			1
her harrowing story , and her subsequent 50 - year search to be reunited with her missing child , has been turned into an @entity38 - nominated film co-written , produced and staring @entity9			1
but while @entity9 has spoken of how a man of the cloth once helped him overcome his daemons - telling the @entity44 in 2009 : ‘ i went to rehab in @entity45 because i was going off the rails a bit			1
and i did once see a priest , but religion was n’t discussed in any of the sessions - he was more of a highly qualified psychotherapist ’ - it seems the meeting with @entity12 focused on the content and issues raised by his new film			1
in 1952 , when @entity27 became pregnant as a teenager in @entity58 , she was sent to a ‘ @entity59 ’ to be taken care of			1
when her son was three years old , he was taken away , sold for adoption and sent to @entity45			1
although @entity27 and her son looked for each other for many years , they were kept apart and were never reunited			1
inspired : @entity27 , the woman who inspired the @entity38 - nominated film ' @entity27 ' , is joined actor and writer @entity9 before a press conference in @entity70 today speaking after the audience , ms @entity27 said that meeting the @entity12 has finally brought her ‘ release ’ after carrying the guilt of having a baby out of wedlock for more than six decades			1
the @entity77 woman , said she finally felt ‘ forgiveness ’ for the mortal sin of becoming an unmarried mother			0
she said : ‘ you were made to feel so bad for having a baby out of wedlock			2
it was such a sin			0
but yesterday after all these years i felt such a sense of relief that i had finally been forgiven			0
’ party time : @entity9 , pictured arriving at the 2014 critics @entity89 in @entity90 , @entity91 mrs @entity27 said : ' it was such an honour and something i would never have expected to do in my life			1
he made me feel so good inside			2
it was such a release ' @entity98 officials told her that the @entity12 probably would see the film			2
the movie is based on a book by @entity104 journalist @entity103 who helped mrs @entity27 track down her son @entity106 in @entity45 fifty years after he was taken from her and sold for adoption			1
tragically @entity106 had just died			0
the film ’s lead actor and screenwriter @entity9 , who played @entity103 , said that the @entity98 seemed ready to accept criticism and ' acknowledge the mistakes of the past '			1
back in the 1990s @entity112 , who sprang to fame as the fictional failing media star @entity115 , was dumped by solicitor @entity116 , the mother of his daughter , after affairs with three women , including a topless model who later revealed how @entity9 showered the bed with £ 5,000 in £ 10 notes and told her : ‘ lie on them			1
go on , lie on them			0
’ he later explained the embarrassing moment as ‘ me being crassly ironic about what you do when you ’re famous ’			0
a brief marriage to society beauty @entity132 ended after just 18 months in 2004 , soon after the comedian was exposed for having a cocaine - fuelled encounter with two lapdancers			2
in typical style , @entity9 laughed the incident off , saying : ‘ i was appalled and shocked to find they were lapdancers			1
i was under the impression they were @entity143 refugees who needed shelter for the night			0
’ in 2005 he had a now notorious two - week liaison with @entity146 , the actress , ex-junkie and widow of rock star @entity149			2
according to @entity146 , the pair enjoyed drug - fuelled sex , during which he allegedly filled their hotel room with sex toys and @entity156 and wanted a prostitute to join them in bed			2
when the brief affair ended , @entity146 launched an angry outburst branding @entity9 an inveterate substance - abuser and a ‘ sex addict ’			1
now older , and hopefully wiser , @entity9 has admitted he suffers from an addictive personality but is determined to bury the drug and sex scandals of the past – not just for his own sake , but for the sake of his daughter			1
after turning 40 , he said : ‘ it ’s time to clean up my act			0
my parents are acclimatised to reading bad stuff about me , but [ my daughter ] is only nine years old			0
’ ' [ the officials who watched the film said that ] its values : @entity27 ’s forgiveness and serenity in spite of misdemeanours committed aginst her was in completely in line with values of church and message of @entity12 , which is a new message of encouraging forgiveness and acknowledging the mistakes of the past			1
' ‘ they did n’t see the criticism as an attack but they saw it as the criticisms of a friend , as constructive criticism , ’ he added			0
the screening coincided with a devastating report by the @entity200 into the @entity98 ’s response to the child abuse scandals including forced adoptions in @entity58			0
but former nurse mrs @entity27 said she had realised that anger would have only brought her ‘ sorrow and sadness ’			2
‘ @entity106 will be 62 this year so how could i go through all of life holding a grudge ? ’ , she explained			0
‘ at the beginning ... i was very hurt and very sad			0
but then i went into psychiatric nursing , so i saw sorrow and such sadness that comes out of bitterness and unforgiveness so i gradually sank my hurt into the background			0
’ emotional : @entity27 , pictured with daughter @entity217 , has said that meeting the @entity12 had brought her ' release ' from the guilt of having a child out of wedlock her story has inspired daughter @entity217 to form a pressure group @entity225 to campaign for the release of adoption records by the @entity77 government			1
mrs @entity27 said after the film many people affected making contact to ask if she knew their mother			1
but she explained : ‘ when i was in the centre you had to lose your identity			0
i was given the name @entity237			0
' we were n’t allowed to talk about anything that happened in the world			0
so we did n’t tell one another our secrets			0
we were so ashamed of the fact that we were there having a baby out of wedlock			0
we did n’t know one another ’s past histories or future histories			2
the film , based on a book @entity251 , has received largely positive reviews , it is not without controversy			2
sister @entity255 of the @entity256 of @entity257 and @entity258 in @entity259 , @entity260 , where @entity27 stayed , claimed the film was misleading			1
ms @entity27 , accompanied by her daughter @entity217 and @entity9 , discussed the @entity263 with the @entity12			1
the project is calling on the @entity77 government to enact legislation to open up adoption records and reunite mothers separated from their children as a result of forced adoption			2
it was set up to harness this increased awareness to the pain and loss which thousands of young women experienced over decades			0
among its objectives , the project is urging for the @entity77 government to release all information it has on the illicit adoptions , to assist in helping mothers and their children to find one another , and to create a place for these individuals to tell their stories in an effort to find closure .			0
