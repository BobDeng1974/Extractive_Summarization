mysterious cases of paralysis in children in the @entity3 may be caused by a previously rare virus spread by sneezing and coughing , according to doctors			1
more than 100 children and young adults in the @entity3 and one child in @entity9 have been taken to hospital with unexplained weakness and paralysis in their limbs , known as acute flaccid paralysis ( @entity15 ) , since september last year			1
a condition , more commonly associated with the polio virus , had been known to cause similar symptoms , but since the virus was eradicated it has become rare			1
researchers found that a cluster of children suffering from ongoing paralysis despite treatment in @entity39 , @entity34 had also suffered from infections of respiratory viruses within three months of their condition appearing			1
enteroviruses are a type of virus that use a single strand of @entity47 to replicate themselves inside the cells of mammals			0
among other enteroviruses are polio , the virus that causes @entity54 along with others that cause a range of respiratory illnesses			2
@entity59 is among the most recently idenfitied and was first spotted in @entity60 in 1962			0
it can cause mild to severe respiratory illness and is likely to be spread by inhaling virus particles when an infected person coughs , sneezes , or touches a surface			2
in previous years only small numbers of @entity69 infections have been reported but that has increased during 2014 , according to the @entity71 and @entity72			1
it has caused severe illness in a number of children and has even been implicated in some deaths			0
the incidence of infections has fallen off considerably since october but public health officials warn that infections seem to spike during the late summer and autumn			0
the scientists found that almost half the children had been infected by a previously rare virus called @entity86 ( @entity69 ) , which is distantly related to polio			1
these children were also found to have damage to the neurons in their spinal cord and in their brainstem			2
the researchers now believe this virus could be behind 107 other unexplained cases of paralysis that have been reported across the @entity3 and a further case reported in @entity9			1
dr @entity98 , a microbial epidemiologist at the @entity34 , who led the research , said : ' the extent to which this new distinctive neurological disease has spread is unknown , but it does not appear to be isolated to @entity34 or the @entity3			0
' if further investigation confirms the link between @entity69 and @entity15 and cranial nerve dysfunction , @entity69 will be added to the list of non-poliovirus enteroviruses capable of causing severe , potentially irreversible neurological damage , and finding effective antiviral therapies and vaccines will be a priority			2
' first identified in @entity60 in 1962 , it is known to cause mild symptoms of fever , sneezing and runny nose , but was rarely seen			0
however , since august 2014 it has been linked to more than 1,000 respiratory infections through out the @entity3			1
the researchers in @entity34 , whose findings are published in the @entity120 tested 12 children who had been admitted to hospital with unexplained paralysis in their limbs			2
they found that eight of the children had suffered from a respiratory viral infection before being affected , five of which were identified as @entity69			1
while the findings do not conclusively prove that @entity69 is responsible for the paralysis , there is other circumstantial evidence			2
other cases of paralysis have appeared during wider outbreaks of @entity69			1
researchers detected @entity69 in nasal swabs from 8 out 41 people with paralysis who were tested			1
there are also signs that the virus has been mutating from its original form since it first appeared in the 1960s			0
scientists at @entity146 in @entity147 are now attempting to develop a treatment to combat infection by the virus			1
they performed x-ray crystallography of the virus and found that its protective shell contains a pocket that helps it infect cells			0
this image shows enterovirus @entity21 while bound to an antiviral compound called pleconaril ( shown in orange )			0
researchers are working on new antiviral molecules that might work against more recent strains of the virus they found that it is possible to bind a molecule within this pocket to prevent this infection from happening			0
professor @entity170 , who is leading the work , said they are now hoping to find compounds that might bind to the virus in this way and could be safely taken as drugs			0
one antiviral drug , known as pleconaril , was found to act against early strains of the virus , but is ineffective against more recent strains			0
professor @entity170 said : ' designing the best possible compound for these newer strains will take more time , but i hope that in a year or so we might have something			0

clusters of acute flaccid paralysis have been springing up around the @entity3
scientists have found cases often occur after infections by enterovirus @entity69
children infected by the virus were found to have damage to their nerves
@entity202 was once a rare respiratory virus but cases *soared* in 2014
the virus is related to the eradicated polio virus that also caused paralysis
there have been 107 cases in the @entity3 of mystery paralysis since september
researchers are attempting to develop new treatments against the virus
