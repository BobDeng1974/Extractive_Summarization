the airline said the cheaper fares – which will initially be offered on flights from @entity8 to five @entity10 destinations – will give passengers ‘ more choice ’			0
holidaymakers who travel with luggage they wish to check in will not pay more to compensate for the lower ‘ hand baggage only ’ fares , the airline said			0
@entity1 will offer customers ' more choice ' when they travel by charging less for hand luggage it is a move likely to be viewed as an attempt by @entity1 to compete with low - cost airlines such as @entity23 and @entity24 that charge more for passengers to check in baggage , effctively charging less for those who do n’t			1
@entity27 , director of @entity8 for @entity1 , said : ‘ the introduction of our hand baggage only fare is all about giving our customers more freedom to choose the kind of flying they want			2
‘ many @entity1 customers on @entity8 short - haul breaks choose not to check in a bag as they ’re already taking advantage of our generous two - bag hand luggage policy			1
@entity1 plan on taking on their budget rivals , such as @entity24 , that encourage only taking hand luggage ‘ those who still want to check in a bag will simply pay the same price they do now			1
’ the flag - carrier said it will initially offer a discount for those travelling with just hand luggage from @entity8 to five short - haul destinations including @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity10			1
the size of discounts will vary depending on the route but will range from £ 9 to £ 15			0

@entity65 , a travel expert at @entity67 , said it was a great opportunity for passengers to have the full ‘ @entity1 offering ’ of food and reward points while being handed a ‘ generous hand luggage allowance ’			2
he said : ‘ this is an interesting move for @entity1 which is clearly looking at other ways to position its offering to price - sensitive customers			2
‘ however passengers who take up the offer to travel without checked luggage will still benefit from a generous hand luggage allowance plus free on board food and drink			0
’ the move comes after @entity84 airline @entity83 decided to begin charging customers who check in luggage on short - haul flights .			0
