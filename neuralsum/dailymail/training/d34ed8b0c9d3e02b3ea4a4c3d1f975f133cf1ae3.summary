@entity0 will make ' no guarantees ' in his bid to dissuade @entity3 from moving to @entity4 , according to former @entity7 fly - half @entity5			1
@entity7 head coach @entity0 met @entity3 earlier this week and will on wednesday announce his senior and @entity9 squads ahead of the @entity10			1
@entity3 is expected to be named in the @entity9 group in a move that could lead the sale fly - half to join @entity4 @entity15 champions @entity14 in the summer			1
former @entity7 fly - half , now with @entity17 , says that @entity3 is the master of his own @entity7 future @entity3 has been capped for the national side nine times since 2008 , scoring 52 points @entity7 refuse to select overseas - based players , save for ' exceptional circumstances ' - a policy that ended @entity5 's @entity26 career when he left @entity27 last year			1
@entity5 revealed sympathy for @entity3 's position , should he be deemed @entity7 's fourth - choice fly - half in @entity32 's updated squads			1
' @entity0 ca n't guarantee someone a position - he ca n't guarantee anything , ' @entity5 told @entity36			2
' he 's a bright guy , he wo n't sit there and say either ' actually you know what , you 're fourth choice ' , or ' you 're going to play '			2
@entity3 has played himself back into contention for an @entity7 recall with outstanding displays for sale ' he 's smart enough to realise he will say ' you 're in the mix , and you 're in a position where we do believe you can add to the side '			1
and that decision then falls on that player to make the call			0
' and that is true from @entity0 - i think he 's going to say ' you 've got an opportunity to fight it out , but at the same time it 's your decision '			2
and that 's all @entity0 can do - he will make no guarantees , because he ca n't			2
you ca n't hedge on @entity7			2
you either get in or you do n't			0
' and the difference in that only comes down to form and timing , and @entity0 ca n't control either of those for someone			2
he will always be honest and say ' you 're in the mix ' and that 's probably as far as he can go			0
' @entity3 is considering a move to @entity4 club @entity14 ahead of the announcement of the @entity10 squad he continued : ' the hard thing is , if you keep hearing ' you 're in the top three ' or ' you 're in the top four ' , it does n't really sell it to you			1
' it 's fantastic to be in the top four in @entity7 , of course - that 's a huge honour			1
but at the same time maybe you can go somewhere else and be number one and do something completely different			0
' third or fourth choice means if everyone 's fit and well you do n't play for your country			0
you come in for two or three days a week every so often , but then you go back to your club to play			0
' that 's a tough position to be in : you can feel as though you 're always dipping your toe in the water but it 's never quite yours			0
' at 27 , the @entity94 star will be hoping that his @entity7 career is not over yet former @entity97 playmaker flood is now settled and thriving at @entity98 after his summer switch from @entity27			1
the 29 - year - old will face his ex-tigers team - mate and @entity7 incumbent @entity103 when @entity105 pitch camp at the @entity106 on sunday			1
@entity5 believes @entity107 can ' nail down ' @entity7 's fly - half berth with ' another big performance ' when the @entity10 opens next month with an intimidating trip to @entity111			1
@entity98 's 60 - cap pivot also expects a stern challenge from @entity105 's increasingly potent midfield			0
' i think @entity103 will be number one in the @entity10 - certainly for the first couple of games , ' said @entity5 , speaking on behalf of @entity119 , official vehicle of @entity121 and a @entity123 2015 partner			1
the fly - half breaks past @entity125 of @entity126 during the @entity10 match back in 2008 ' but he needs another big performance in there , really , to nail that down			1
' @entity7 have five guys chomping at the bit , with @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity3 and @entity134 too			1
' that 's the @entity136 effect : every young kid wanted to emulate @entity136 and drop that goal , so now you 've got five guys of a similar age here who are desperate to get involved			0
' there 's a lot of layers to @entity105 's attack , with @entity103 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150 all options in midfield			0
' @entity103 comes to the line really well , waits for a defence to make a decision and then usually chooses the right option			0
@entity149 is another pair of hands and @entity148 can cause absolute mayhem			0
they are willing to take risks , play with flair and take things on			0
' it 's nice to see an @entity166 team with almost carte blanche			0
' @entity3 had a meeting with @entity0 earlier this week and is set for further talks on wednesday			2
