a top @entity1 general responsible for shaping the military of the future has revealed that robots could make up a quarter of the army within the next few decades			1
general @entity6 said the hi - tech machines will fight alongside soldiers on the battlefield by 2030 or 2040 , in a bid to make the army ' a smaller , more lethal , deployable and agile force '			1
speaking at an army aviation symposium , in @entity14 , @entity15 , the head of @entity17 ( @entity17 ) gave his vision of sci - fi made reality			1
attack force : the army of the future could be made of autonomous robots fighting alongside soldiers , a top @entity1 general revealed he said modern health and safety concerns designed to keeping soldiers safe - adding armour and protection to vehicles and personnel - had caused the army to lose some of its lethal edge			1
he hinted that robots could revitalise the @entity1 army 's killing force			2
but he cautioned that the machinery required would demand a major revolution in robotic technology			0
general @entity6 said : ' i â€™ve got clear guidance to think about what if you could robotically perform some of the tasks in terms of maneuverability , in terms of the future of the force , ' according to @entity54			1
put through its paces : a strikingly human - like robot undergoes testing in a laboratory which could help produce mechanical soldiers by 2030 the @entity60 is under pressure to cut the number of soldiers , from 540,000 soldiers to about 490,000 by the end of 2015 , and down to 420,000 by 2019 , according to some reports			1
one of the major factors driving the pursuit of robotic battlefield technology is the need to drive down the cost of the conventional army			2
in 2012 , 25 per cent of the near $ 130 billion plus @entity74 budget went on serving and retired members of the military , according to @entity77			0
future today : robots , such as this one known as @entity79 , are currently in use by the @entity1 army the increased reliance on robots would help slash the huge expense used to train , equip , accommodate , nurse and retire regular troops			0
the @entity60 has had a long - running mission to create autonomous robots - machines capable of making decisions , in real time , on the frontline to changing circumstances			0
more than a decade of war in @entity94 and @entity95 allowed the public to see the huge resources already dedicated to unmanned systems ; from the high - flying @entity99 to the lethal predator drones to hand - launched @entity101			0
revolution : autonomous vehicles and remote controlled aircraft are no longer a thing from science fiction but a battlefield reality - now the next generation of military robots is being designed but on the ground , thousands of small , remotely operated robots also have proven their value in dealing with roadside bombs , a lethal threat to @entity1 troops in both wars			2
the army has already been trailing remote controlled vehicles , such as the @entity119 , a specially made truck that comes complete with eight rotors - four on each side - that spring out for take off and then fold in while driving			0
the machine was built as part of a @entity1 military desire for a ' multi-mission medical and casualty evacuation unmanned air vehicle / unmanned ground vehicle ' .			0

general @entity6 is head of @entity17
he expects soldiers to fight alongside robots by 2030 to 2040
health and safety concerns mean human army has lost some lethal forces
general @entity6 is calling for a *breakthrough* in science and technology
