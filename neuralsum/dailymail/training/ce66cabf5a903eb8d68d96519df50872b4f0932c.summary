by @entity1 reporter published : 03:40 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 06:32 est , 11 october 2012 an inmate on death row used his last breath to protest his innocence of the murder of a 12 - year - old girl as he was executed in @entity8 last night despite his legal team arguing he was mentally ill. @entity10 , 44 , was jailed for the abduction , rape and strangling of @entity14 , 12 , whose body was found at his home a month after she was reported missing in 2000			1
several last ditch appeals were made on the basis of his mental health in an attempt to save him from the death penalty but @entity10 was given a lethal injection after the @entity25 @entity24 rejected the arguments to spare him			1
too mentally ill : inmate @entity10 , left , was executed last night despite arguments by his legal team that he should be spared execution for the murder of @entity31 , right , because he was mentally ill the 11th - hour appeals delayed the punishment nearly five hours past the initial 6pm execution time and as the midnight expiration of the death warrant neared			1
asked by the warden if he had a statement from the death chamber gurney , @entity10 shook his head and replied : ' no ' but seconds later he changed his mind , adding : ' i 'm an innocent man			1
y'all are killing an innocent man			2
' he then looked down at his left arm where one of the needles carrying the lethal drug was inserted , and said : ' it 's hurting me bad			2
' but almost immediately he began snoring loudly			0

@entity10 was pronounced dead 18 minutes later at 10.45pm			2
the family of @entity10 's victim lived across a highway from him in @entity58 , about 45 miles northwest of @entity59 , when she disappeared			1
investigators questioned @entity10 at least twice in the days following @entity14 's disappearance 12 years ago			1
delusional belief : @entity63 claimed he could n't have killed the @entity65 schoolgirl , who disappeared while walking home in @entity58 , because letters exist that show he was somewhere in @entity69 when the victim died his wallet was found in some woods near clothing and jewellery that belonged to @entity14 but authorities found nothing else of significance at the time			1
a few weeks later , a tip from a neighbour about an unusually large burn pile behind his ramshackle home brought them back again			2
while @entity10 had been cooperative in the past , he grew testy and ordered them off his property when an @entity88 agent looking at the fire site detected the smell of a decaying body and inserted a metal probe into a patch of disturbed earth			1

there has been increasing opposition to capital punishment in the @entity25 and seventeen states - including @entity104 - have banned its use			0
but many states , such as @entity8 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 , still impose the death penalty			0
there have been a total of 486 executions in @entity8 since 1976 - the highest amount of all @entity25 states - with 317 inmates currently on death row			0
@entity10 's lethal injection is the 10th this year in @entity8 and the first of four scheduled for this month in the nation 's most active death penalty state			1
@entity108 has the second highest number of executions with 109 since 1976 but has just 12 inmates on death row			0
and while @entity127 has only conducted 13 executions in the last 36 years , it has the highest number of prisoners on death row , with 721 awaiting their sentence			0
@entity110 - which has the fourth highest number of executions with 73 since 1976 - currently has the second highest number of death row inmates with 402			0
but the number of @entity25 in favour of capital punishment is decreasing			0
there were 37 executions in the @entity25 in 2008 - the lowest number since 1994			0
in 2010 , 46 people were executed and in 2011 , 43 inmates were all killed by lethal injection			0

they returned hours later with a search warrant and a dog trained to detect human remains			0
the dog led officers to the girl 's body , stuffed inside a laundry bag in the home and wedged into a corner behind a piece of furniture			2

@entity10 's lethal injection is the 10th this year in @entity8 and the first of four scheduled for this month in the nation 's most active death penalty state			1

but the @entity8 attorney general 's office persuaded the 5th @entity202 to overturn that ruling and lift the stay of execution late tuesday			2
@entity10 's lawyer , @entity206 , said his client hallucinated about the ' ongoing spiritual warfare between two sets of voices representing good and evil '			1
the appeals court ruled that none of @entity10 's hearings had been unfair and it was reasonable to find @entity10 competent for the death penalty			1
@entity10 told a psychiatrist who examined him before the competency hearing that he did n't and could n't have killed @entity14 , that false evidence was used against him and that he understood a murder conviction could result in him receiving an injection that would kill him			1
