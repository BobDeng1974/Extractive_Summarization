a drug manufacturer is being investigated by health experts in @entity2 who are looking into a possible link between the death of several babies and @entity8 vaccines			1
a team of government investigators has been sent to @entity11 , a drug maker based in the southern city of @entity13 , state broadcaster @entity14 said , amid growing public concern about the safety of its products			1

investigation : a drug manufacturer is being investigated by health experts in @entity2 one case has been ruled out while the others were still being investigated			1
repeated calls to @entity11 's @entity13 headquarters were disconnected after a few rings			1
in a statement earlier this month , the company said it was confident in the safety of its products and that the deaths could be caused by underlying diseases that were incubating in the babies and coincidentally started showing symptoms after the inoculations			0
' coincidental diseases arise the most easily and are the easiest to misinterpret , ' the statement on @entity11 's website said			2
a senior government expert in diseases said vaccine - related deaths could be due to coincidence , but that @entity11 was not in the position to make an objective assessment			1
' we should not treat the company 's statement like a conclusion , ' dr. @entity51 , chief epidemiologist with the @entity52 , said in a phone interview			0
' they may be trying to protect their self - interest			0
or they may have a lot of confidence in their product			0
' @entity65 is a chronic liver infection that is spread through the blood or bodily fluids of infected people			0
it can cause liver inflammation and jaundice			0
the vaccines were being given to children free of charge as part of the government 's national immunization program			2
but @entity2 health authorities suspended the use of @entity11 's hepatitis b vaccines last friday after the first deaths of babies were reported			1
vaccine : since november , six babies died shortly after they received hepatitis b vaccines four babies reportedly died in the southern province of @entity88 - although one of them was said to have died from pneumonia			1
the @entity91 reported that two babies in @entity94 province and another in @entity95 had also died in a similar way			2
public confidence in @entity2 health authorities and the country 's drug safety regime is shaky at best , though improvements have been made in recent years since government agencies dragged their feet and withheld information about the spread of @entity106 and bird flu			0
concerns over vaccine safety have surfaced in recent years after media reports of problems with vaccines for encephalitis , hepatitis b and other diseases , though the health ministry said the vaccines had been improperly stored but were unrelated to subsequent illnesses that were reported			2
@entity51 , the government expert , urged the public not to panic , saying that in general @entity2 vaccines were safe and that more people would die if everyone refused inoculations due to worries about the recent deaths			2
' if the public refuses to be vaccinated , or if they try to change the vaccination procedures , the consequence will be extremely bad , ' @entity51 said			0
' instead of several deaths , it will cause tens of thousands of deaths			0
