one @entity11 clinic has seen male patient visits increase by 25 per cent during 2013			1
dr @entity13 , founder of 111 @entity11 , has seen a rapidly growing male patient base over the past five years , with demand reaching unprecedented levels this year			0
@entity17 : @entity3 and @entity4 have both admitted to freezing time with the help of @entity7 - and it seems it 's catching on with the public too speaking about the rise , he said : ‘ men used to book appointments first thing in the morning or late at night so there was no risk of being faced with a waiting room with other people ; there was a genuine fear of the stigma attached to visiting a cosmetic surgeon			1
@entity32 ' male patients now visit during peak hours , whether it be on a lunch break for a @entity7 treatment , or taking an afternoon off for an anti-ageing @entity39 laser session			1
' the demand for non-surgical treatments showed peaks at certain times during the year , with an influx pre-christmas and during february bonus season			1
this is reportedly down to workers aiming to look ' calm and de-stressed '			0
' workers are under tremendous pressure to achieve , and my male patients want lasting results that look natural			0
' a single @entity7 treatment can last four months while the thought of applying cosmetics each day is daunting ' , dr @entity13 explained			1
his clinic is n't the only one seeing an increase in @entity17			2
in 2012 the private clinic on @entity11 treated three times as many men with @entity7 as it did in 2011 with patient numbers set to have risen further by the end of 2013			1
party time : the demand for non-surgical treatments showed defined peaks at certain times during the year , with an influx pre-christmas and during february bonus season men now account for almost 20 per cent of @entity7 patients at @entity73 ’s @entity72 - wide practices			1
dr @entity74 , joint medical director at @entity73 of @entity11 , said : ' i think it ’s fair to say that today men have a more open attitude towards cosmetic procedures			2
i also think men are now more aware of the treatments that are available to them			2
' if we look back 5 - 10 years , you would find a far lower number of men willing to have cosmetic treatments to improve the way they look ; not because they did not want to undergo the procedure , but perhaps because they were embarrassed or did not want others to see them as vain			2
' now , however , perceptions have changed and people do n’t associate cosmetic treatments solely with women			0
' also , increasingly men in the public eye are looking younger and healthier far later in life			0
this is another factor that may be having an impact on the number of men considering the possibility of undergoing cosmetic procedures			0
' over time the age range of men that i have treated with @entity7 has also widened			1
where it was once predominately men in their 30s , now i see more men in their 40s and 50s			0
i also treat men in a wider range of professions			0
' those whose appearance is an important part of their job , those in competitive environments and those who have to have direct contact with clients or customers every day , are the men i probably see most often			0
' the priority for a lot of men is to look subtly younger by removing or reducing the visibility of lines around the eyes , forehead and mouth			0

peaked pre-christmas and during february bonus season
one clinic treated three times as many men with @entity7 as in 2011
