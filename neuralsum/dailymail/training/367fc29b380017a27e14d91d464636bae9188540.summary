@entity0 with his dogs @entity2 and @entity3 attending a press launch for @entity6 's @entity5 he treats them as if they are his children and used them as part of his ‘ baby training ’ before becoming a father to son @entity12			1
now @entity0 has installed an electric fence in his back garden to protect @entity16 terriers @entity2 and @entity3 from the threat of a fox attack			1
the tv personality ’s decision , after an urban fox was spotted prowling the grounds of his £ 12million west @entity22 home , saw him branded ‘ ridiculous ’ by neighbours yesterday			2
@entity0 , 54 , bought the puppies last year with his girlfriend @entity27 , 36 , and named them after his favourite 1960s cartoon about a musical squid , called @entity2			1
the animals have travelled across the @entity31 with them as @entity0 works on each country ’s version of @entity35 and the @entity5 franchise			2
yesterday , workmen were seen entering his large detached mansion with electrical equipment			1
it is thought the wire , which is similar to that used to keep cattle in fields , would produce a small non-fatal shock that would deter rather than injure any foxes			1
council officials were consulted before the fence was put up to make sure it did not break local government planning laws			0
but residents living on the road think it amounts to ‘ over-kill ’ for two little dogs			1
the actress @entity55 , 78 , who has lived on the road her whole life , said : ‘ he should not be on this street			0
he has so much money , he does n’t know what he wants to do with it			0
‘ [ the electric fence ] is dangerous for cats			0
the foxes do n’t harm pets – i ’ve seen cats see them off when they ’re in the garden			1
‘ foxes only come out at night , so why does n’t he shut his little dogs in ? hey ’ve no right to put up this fence – it ’s ridiculous			1
‘ this used to be a proper neighbourhood once where everyone knew each other			0
’ another neighbour , @entity80 , 72 , a shipbroker who has lived on the road for 40 years , said : ‘ we have had foxes in the garden and they go for the rubbish			2
but there are cat owners living on this street and i can see their point of view that they might be harmed by this fence			0
’ one neighbour , who owns both a dog and cats , added : ‘ i ’ve lived here for two years and not once seen a fox			0
i do n’t think he ’s put it up for the foxes – that might just be the excuse			2
’ before the birth of his son @entity12 in february , @entity0 revealed that the puppies had free run of his homes			0
the pair slept either at the foot of his king - size bed or on his head			0
@entity0 and girlfriend @entity27 are concerned that foxes might attack their dogs so have put up an electric fence in their garden to deter the vermin @entity0 has previously revealed : ‘ i think dogs are good training for babies			1
they are still puppies and they are falling in the swimming pool and getting lost in the house			0
‘ this is a bit of a road test for the real thing			0
@entity2 is the girl and @entity3 is the boy and they are very naughty but great fun			1
’ last year the puppies embarrassed @entity0 after @entity3 urinated on the floor of a posh boutique in @entity134 , @entity135 , and @entity2 did its business on their cream carpet while he was being interviewed			1
a source close to @entity0 and @entity27 said : ‘ they saw a fox or noticed some fox droppings in their garden and were quite concerned			0
they love the dogs very much and fear that a fox could quite easily kill them			2
‘ they have put a wire along one wall where they think the foxes would come from			1
it ’s not fatal but would give a deterrent shock – similar to that used in the countryside by farmers to keep cattle in a secure field			2
’ a council spokesman said no formal planning permission was needed for the fence .			0
