by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 03:53 est , 23 april 2013 updated : 07:26 est , 23 april 2013 chancellor of the exchequer @entity2 , pictured in @entity3 today , denied getting panicky about the state of the economy @entity2 today denied getting ‘ panicky ’ about the state of the @entity10 economy as new figures revealed borrowing by the government remains stubbornly high			1
@entity11 fell only slightly last year to £ 120.6billion , just £ 300million lower than in 2011 - 12			1
it is is worse than @entity13 hopes for a £ 117 billion deficit in the financial year			2
asked today if was ‘ getting a bit panicky ’ about the economy 's parlous state , mr @entity2 replied : ‘ no , no , no. the answer is no. ’ the government has trumpeted its efforts to cut the deficit as proof its austerity cuts are working			1
the headline borrowing figure for last year stood at £ 86.2billion			2
but when the transfer of @entity27 pension assets to the public purse , plus cash transfers from the government 's quantitative easing programme , are factored in it stands at £ 120.6billion			1
this is only down £ 300million on the £ 120.9billion borrowed by the government in 2011 - 12			1
the @entity35 expects borrowing to remain high at £ 120billion in the next year to march 2014 as well			2
mr @entity2 was forced to deny being ‘ cute ’ by claiming that the deficit – the gap between what the government spends and what it raises in taxes - had fallen by a third			2
‘ it ’s not being cute at all			0
the budget deficit was 11.5 per cent of our national income when this government came to office , it is now forecast to be just under 8 per cent - that is a reduction , it ’s a reduction of a third thanks to the very difficult decisions , ’ he told @entity44 ’s today programme			1
‘ as a result , the @entity10 economy , when you compare it to lots of its neighbours , of course faces a difficult situation but not nearly as difficult as those other countries that have not faced up to their problems , that have not supported their private sector , that have not made themselves more competitive so they can compete in the global race			1
’ the chancellor is under pressure ahead of figures on growth out this thursday which will show if the economy is back in recession underlying figures show the government borrowed £ 120.6billion last year , compared to £ 120.9billion in 2011 - 12 , the @entity76 said but @entity79 claimed today 's borrowing figures were proof that the government 's plan is not working			1
shadow treasury minister @entity83 said : ' these figures show that the government ’s failed economic policies have been totally self - defeating as a flatlining economy has seen deficit reduction grind to a halt			1
' underlying borrowing was essentially the same last year as the year before and the @entity35 forecasts it will be around the same this year			0
' @entity2 no longer has a deficit reduction plan			0
in fact , at this rate , it will take 400 years to balance the books			0
' total public sector net debt was a record £ 1.186 trillion in march , equating to 75.4 per cent of gdp and up from £ 1.1 trillion a year earlier			0
@entity100 economist @entity99 said the pace of deficit reduction ' makes a snail look fast '			0
he said : ' march public finance data are unlikely to take the heat off the chancellor and he faces another very difficult year ahead on both the growth and the public finance fronts			2
' @entity109 at @entity110 said that while the march outcome was a little better than expected , the ' underlying story on the @entity10 's fiscal position was one of hardly any improvement despite so much talk of austerity '			1
a @entity119 spokeswoman said : ' though it is taking time , the government is fixing this country 's economic problems			1
' the deficit is down by a third , a million and a quarter new private sector jobs have been created and interest rates are at near - record lows , benefiting households and businesses			0
' figures on thursday will reveal whether or not @entity10 has fallen into an unprecedented triple dip recession the chancellor is under pressure ahead of figures this week which will show if the @entity10 managed to avoid an unprecedented triple - dip recession by growing in the first three months of the year			1
the @entity135 last week cut the @entity10 's growth forecast growth from 1 per cent to 0.7 per cent for this year and 2014 's projection from 1.9 per cent to 1.5 per cent , noting the recovery was ' progressing slowly '			1
@entity135 chief economist @entity139 has accused mr @entity2 of ‘ playing with fire ’ by pressing ahead with cuts despite a lack of growth			0
but today mr @entity2 dismissed mr @entity139 ’s criticism as ‘ one voice , one person ’			0
the chancellor told @entity44 : ‘ what the @entity135 has said actually is that the @entity10 is forecast to grow more than @entity149 , than @entity150 , than the rest of the eurozone – that is one voice , one person			1
‘ the chief economist has a well - known set of views on this , which he has expressed in various forms over several years			0
the @entity135 will do its analysis of the @entity10 economy , as it does all economies – it ’s coming to @entity10 in may to do that			1
’ of the major economies listed in the @entity135 's @entity163 , the prediction of 0.7 per cent growth puts the @entity10 well below the @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity168 and much of @entity169 mr @entity139 has been a longstanding critics of the @entity10 ’s austerity programme			2
last week he said : ‘ the @entity10 economy has turned out to be somewhat weaker than had been foreseen , so our view is that the pace of consolidation ought to be reconsidered , and we ’ll want to come and have some discussions about that			2
’ yesterday it also emerged that cabinet secretary sir @entity180 has privately voiced frustrations at the different approaches to the economy taken by mr @entity2 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity186			0
sir @entity180 told senior bankers that the prime minister is prioritising exports , mr @entity185 wants regional growth schemes , while business secretary mr @entity186 wants to pressure the banks into lending and mr @entity2 is concentrating on infrastructure			0
sir @entity195 , the former deputy governor of the @entity196 , also questioned whether the chancellor is truly in charge of his economic policy			0
in a newspaper article published yesterday , sir @entity195 pointed out that mr @entity2 has subcontracted much of his policy to the @entity110 , which is in charge of quantitative easing - effectively printing money in a bid to boost the economy			2
‘ it leaves unclear who is in charge , ’ he wrote			0
‘ the chancellor is responsible for the strategy of monetary activism alongside fiscal and prudential retrenchment			0
but he has not given himself the powers to determine the policy mixture ’ .			0

chancellor *insists* he is taking the right ' tough decisions ' for the economy
