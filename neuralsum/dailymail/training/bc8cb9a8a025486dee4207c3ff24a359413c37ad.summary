by @entity0 the @entity1 and the @entity2 clash at the @entity3 in this @entity5 divisional match - up with both teams looking to shake off questionable performances last sunday			1
early in the campaign it may be , but the @entity1 have the opportunity to move to 2 - 0 both this season and in the division , which could prove vital come week 17			1
on the flip side , the @entity2 could be 0 - 2 both overall and in the division with another loss on thursday			2
the @entity1 looked to be control against the @entity17 last sunday			1
leading 27 - 3 at half - time , their defensive frailties that were evident during a pre-season matchup against the fast - paced , no - huddle offense of the @entity21 surfaced their ugly head once again			2
on the march : @entity25 's @entity1 are looking to build on their win in week one disappointment : @entity27 's @entity2 suffered a 23 - 16 defeat by the @entity29 on sunday the @entity17 rallied to ensure a frantic finale at @entity31 , but the @entity1 escaped with a 30 - 27 win			1
rookie linebacker @entity33 amassed five tackles on his debut but , as a unit , the run defense of the @entity1 will need to improve against the @entity2			1
@entity25 , who is entering his 11th season , threw for 365 yards , one touchdown and an interception against @entity17 , showcasing his unique ability to keep plays alive whilst under duress			2
both running back @entity44 and wideout @entity45 continued where they left off last season			1
@entity44 rushed for 109 yards and a touchdown from 21 carries , along with six receptions for 88 yards			0
@entity45 , meanwhile , reeled in five catches for 116 yards and a touchdown			0
second year wideout @entity53 played an integral part of the final drive that led to the game - winning field goal , reeling in six receptions for 97 yards on sunday			0
nervy : the @entity1 held off a @entity17 comeback as @entity61 kicked a game - winning field goal still got it : @entity64 scored an excellent 80 - yard touchdown for @entity2 , but it was in a losing cause the @entity2 , on the other hand , looked miserable during their 23 - 16 defeat by the @entity29			1
the offense had a resilient defense to thank for keeping them in the contest as they only allowed the @entity29 ' to complete just four of 14 third down attempts			0
@entity27 was sacked a career - high 22 times last season as the @entity2 stuttered to an 8 - 8 record			2
former @entity78 head coach @entity79 has been brought in as the new offensive coordinator as the team look to revitalise @entity27 back into the pre-big money contract form that took them to the @entity84 two years ago			0
evidently , this is still a work in progress as @entity27 attempted 62 passes , completing 35 for a total 345 yards			0
the offense was n't helped by a number of dropped passes			0
@entity64 , however , continues to defy father time , his 80 - yard touchdown on sunday was the longest of his career to date			0
gone : @entity2 released running back @entity96 after new video footage emerged of him punching his wife the @entity2 moved swiftly on monday to release @entity96 from his contract following the emergence of video footage relating to his domestic violence charge during the off - season			1
fellow running back @entity105 ' struggles were evident , as he totaled just 14 yards from six carries			1
however , there may still be hope for this @entity2 team looking to expose the poor run defense of the @entity1 as @entity110 rushed for 70 yards and a touchdown off eleven carries			2
to have your say on the @entity113 , listen to the @entity115 's live call in show on sundays from 4pm			0
