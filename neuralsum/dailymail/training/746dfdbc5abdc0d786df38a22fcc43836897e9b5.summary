click here to read why @entity1 knew @entity2 was worth the money @entity5 midfielder @entity4 has vowed to put behind him the negativity that marred his final year at @entity8 and prove wrong those who doubt his ability			1
he said : ‘ you do n’t turn into a bad player just because someone says it on @entity15			0
i probably was n’t the only @entity8 player to get it last year			1
for as long as @entity8 are n’t winning trophies , players will get criticised			1
i ’m fully aware of that			0
i ’ve still got a league title , 13 @entity23 caps			1
‘ if all the players say they were high in confidence last season i think they would be lying			0
it was n’t just me			0
it was the rest of the squad too			0
that ’s football for you			0
the year before i won the league , played 20 - odd games			0
’ ‘ football is a game of opinions , you ca n’t please everyone and the main opinion for me is the manager i am playing under			0
’ @entity4 , 25 , was told by new @entity8 boss @entity48 that his opportunities would be limited this season , so he forced through a loan move in the final seconds of deadline day by calling @entity5 manager @entity53 after a few fraught hours to explain his desire to play			1
it appears that his agent , @entity56 , almost scuppered the move , with @entity5 unhappy that @entity58 were brought into discussions without a word of notice — and @entity4 admitted he and @entity53 gave his representative a ‘ bit of stick ’			1
@entity4 was not the only player to suffer under @entity67 ' reign at @entity68 @entity48 , with @entity2 ( @entity69 ) and @entity70 ( r ) , told @entity4 chances would be limited but @entity58 boss @entity72 , who worked with @entity4 at @entity73 , believes @entity8 blocked any chance he had of getting the player on a season - long loan			1
‘ i am a big admirer of @entity4 , ’ said @entity72			1
‘ that was an opportunity that we explored on the last day of the window but it could n’t happen for different reasons			2
i do n’t think there was just one aspect			0
@entity4 can boast a better passing accuracy than his @entity5 midfield counterparts ‘ it ’s the parent club that makes that decision			1
maybe they just did n’t want to send a player on loan to a club who are going to be challenging for things and finished above them last season , i do n’t know			2
‘ our information was that the player was n’t available on loan full stop			0
you can look at the table from last season and we finished fifth and they finished a bit lower , so from that respect you can understand			0
@entity4 arrived at @entity5 despite late interest from @entity58 manager @entity72 @entity72 claims @entity8 blocked move because they did n't want to sell to close rivals ‘ but , at the same time , @entity5 have started the season really well			1
they are going to be a strong team			0
but we ca n’t comment on that , it is down to @entity8			1
a situation with @entity4 came up that i was happy to explore			2
in the end it did n’t work out			0
’ @entity4 makes his debut on saturday at @entity117 , where he is expecting a frosty reception after 14 years at @entity68			2
he added : ‘ i am happy to get away from some of the negativity that surrounded me at @entity8			2
i want to get @entity5 back up in the top half where this club belong			2
my first target is getting in the @entity5 team , second is playing well and third is hopefully getting back in the @entity23 squad			1
