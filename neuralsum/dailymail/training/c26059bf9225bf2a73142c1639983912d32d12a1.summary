advice : following her medal win , @entity18 said if there is something people want to achieve in life then they should go for it multi-talented : @entity18 is pictured in the fencing phase of the modern pentathlon at the @entity67 emotional : @entity18 screams out after her fencing match bizarre : the running and shooting elements are contested in tandem - with athletes having three bouts of shooting each followed by a 1000m run			1
@entity18 is pictured taking part in the shooting star : @entity18 , second right , is seen during the combined run - shoot event the modern pentathlon requires the athletes to be multi-talented across a range of disciples			1
it includes five events - pistol shooting , fencing , 200m freestyle swimming , show jumping , and a 3 km cross-country run			1
apart from the fencing competition , the athletes do not compete directly against each other			0
points for each event combine to give overall total scores			0
for the final event - the cross-country run - the competitors are ranked according to their score from the first four rounds			1
they are given different start times with the leader going first			0
one of the most bizarre aspects of the event is that the running and shooting elements are contested in tandem - with athletes having three bouts of shooting each followed by a 1000m run			2
since 1949 an annual @entity113 has taken place in non-olympic years			0

among those to miss out was @entity140 silver medallist @entity139 , so the pressure was on the @entity53 pair to perform			0
the action began this morning in the @entity144 with the fencing , an event where @entity29 usually excels , living up to her nickname ' @entity29 '			0
she was not quite on top form today , winning 19 of her 35 bouts for 856 points , which put her tied for 11 but 100 points down on where she would have wanted to be			0
@entity18 had the worst possible start , losing her first seven fights , but she recovered impressively and ended the fencing only one win behind @entity29 in joint 16th			0
