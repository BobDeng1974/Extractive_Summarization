by @entity0 and @entity1 filmmakers have been told they must meet stringent new targets on diversity if they want to win grants from one of @entity8 's biggest arts bodies			0
the @entity9 , which hands out £ 27million a year , has introduced a ' three ticks ' system which includes quotas on the number of actors and crew who are female , gay , working - class , disabled or from ethnic minorities			1
once the system takes effect in september , budding filmmakers must satisfy at least two out of the three categories before they can be eligible for funds			2
the @entity9 has told filmmakers they will have to meet their new diversity targets if they are to receive funding in the future			1
its headquarters is pictured in @entity29 , @entity30 despite mps raising concerns about so - called ' quota ' systems in the past , the move was praised by culture minister @entity36 , who said it would ' raise the bar ' to make films reflect modern @entity8			2
the @entity9 , a government body which distributes millions in lottery funds , is now recruiting a ' diversity expert ' to ensure its rules are put in place correctly			1
in advice about its new rules , which it said are obligatory , the @entity9 gave examples of films which should be seen as models of ' telling diverse stories '			1
they include @entity52 , which depicts the struggles of the illegitimate mixed - race daughter of an 18th century @entity57 officer , and @entity58 , a film about a streetwise teenager on a south @entity30 housing estate who meets his long - lost @entity63 brother			0
the @entity64 , starring @entity65 , centre and @entity67 , right , was backed by funding from the @entity9 another is @entity70 , a romantic comedy about gay activists in 1984 featuring @entity73			0
in order to comply with the rules , films must ' tick ' at least two out of three categories from ' on - screen diversity ' , ' off - screen diversity ' and ' creating opportunities and promoting social mobility '			1
on the set , film companies will be asked to ensure 30 per cent of supporting and background characters ' positively reflect ' diversity			1
the @entity9 wants filmmakers to satisfy at least two out of three of its criteria if they are to win funding for new projects			2
the government body , which is employing a ' diversity expert ' to ensure rules are put in place correctly , has set out its three categories as follows : 1			2
on - screen diversity : diverse subject matter , at least one lead character positively reflecting diversity , at least 30 per cent of supporting and background characters positively reflecting diversity 2			1
off - screen diversity : diverse key creatives ( director , screenwriter , composer , cinematographer ) , at least two heads of @entity112 from diverse backgrounds , production crew and production company staff ( both with a range of targets across different diverse groups ) 3			1
creating opportunities and promoting social mobility : paid internships and employment opportunities for new entrants from diverse backgrounds , training placements for people from diverse backgrounds in the off - screen category , at least two heads of department would have to be from ' diverse backgrounds '			1
the third category requires film - makers to provide ' paid internships and employment opportunities ' and training placements for people from diverse backgrounds			1
the initiative , which the @entity9 says is backed by @entity8 producers ’ association @entity137 as well as ethnic minority recruitment and training charity @entity140 , will be rolled out from september			0
last month , @entity142 mp @entity141 hit out at @entity143 pledges to ensure that one in seven actors and presenters will be black , @entity147 or from ethinic minorities within the next three years			0
the @entity9 also helped to fund the film , @entity150 , starring @entity151 , left , and @entity152 , right			2
future films will have to tick two out of three new boxes to satisfy new diversity targets and he told @entity157 today that recruiters should be ' blind ' to matters such as religion , race and gender , adding : ' this sort of political correctness is the kind of thing that makes people 's blood boil			0
' but defending the @entity9 scheme , culture minister @entity36 said : ' this initiative from the @entity9 should help raise the bar and ensure @entity9 lottery funded film productions reflect diversity both in front and behind the camera			1
' i want to continue to see the tv , film and the performing arts industries actively discussing how they can drive change and improve diversity right across these sectors			0
' i hope others will follow the @entity9 in developing and implementing possible solutions			0
' @entity9 chief executive , @entity187 said it was ' vital ' that the film industry represented society , to ensure the sector remained ' really relevant '			2
@entity191 arrives for the @entity8 premiere of @entity52 , in @entity30 the @entity193 is the largest public film fund in the @entity8 , investing more than £ 27m into film development , production , international sales and distribution , and supporting around30 new film productions each year			1
but in advice about its new criteria , which it said are obligatory , the body gave examples of films which it now considers should be seen as models of ' telling diverse stories '			0
they include @entity52 , which depicts the struggles of the illegitimate mixed - race daughter of an 18th century @entity57 officer			0
the @entity8 - made film , released in the @entity8 last month , has made nearly £ 5.8million at the box office , and starred @entity191 , @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217			2
another example was @entity58 , a film about a streetwise teenager on a south @entity30 housing estate who meets his long - lost @entity63 brother			0
the movie , starring @entity225 and @entity226 , explores tensions between wthnic minorities on the estate and premiered at the 2013 @entity230			0
it also singles out @entity70 , starring @entity73 , which charts the lives of gay activists and their attempts to support the miners ' strike in a village community in @entity239 .			0
