president @entity0 played down the rocky relationship he and defense secretary @entity2 have had throughout the @entity5 chief 's two - year tenure at a retirement ceremony on wednesday afternoon			1
' in an era of politics that too often descends into spectacle , you ’ve always served with decency and dignity			0
and in a town of outsized egos , you ’ve never lost your @entity17 humility , ' @entity0 said of @entity18 , a @entity19 native			1
' you ’ve always been frank and honest and said what you thought			0
and i have so profoundly benefited from that candor , ' @entity0 added			1
a military man turned politician , @entity18 represented @entity19 in the @entity26 for two terms before leaving the upper chamber in 2009 to work in academia			1
@entity0 plucked him out of retirement from public service in 2013 to serve as one of his top military advisers			1
the relationship between the two men of opposing political parties soon soured , however , and less than two years after taking the position , @entity18 resigned , reportedly under pressure from the president himself			1
@entity0 said at a ceremony announcing the departure in november that it was @entity18 's decision to leave			1
but the @entity57 has since maintained that he and @entity18 ' arrived together at the determination that new leadership should take over ' at the @entity5			1
a senior @entity5 official told @entity61 at the time that @entity18 was asked to step down because the president no longer had confidence in his ability to lead the military as it struggled to defeat @entity67 extremists waging war in the @entity69			1
' he was n’t up to the job , ' the official said			0
@entity0 's spokesman , @entity72 , told reporters that was n't true and that @entity18 ' has been the right person for the job , and he has performed to the president 's expectations in a way ... [ that ] will contribute to the ongoing effort that has made the @entity82 military the most powerful force for good in the world			1
' still , @entity72 admitted that the challenges now facing the @entity5 are different that those that were at the forefront when he was nominated for defense secretary			2
at that time , @entity72 said , ' the threat that was posed by @entity89 was not nearly as significant as it is now			2
' ' the priorities of the department , or at least of the new secretary , have changed given changes in the international community , ' he said			0
' it does n't mean that @entity18 has n't done an excellent job of managing these crises as they have popped up , ' @entity72 continued , but it does mean ' that another secretary might be better suited to meet those challenges - that was something the two of them agreed			2
' less than two years after being nominated to lead the @entity5 , @entity18 resigned in november , reportedly under pressure from the president today @entity72 's stand - in , deputy press secretary @entity108 , said ' friction ' between the @entity57 and the @entity5 is ' something that predates this administration			1
' asked specifically about @entity18 's predecessors , @entity114 and @entity115 , both of whom wrote scathing critiques of their time in the @entity0 administration once they 'd exited the president 's service , @entity112 said the president and his staff ' always deeply value and respect the input of our military leadership			1
' ' that 's something that is placed at paramount value here at the @entity57 and something that goes into every consideration the president makes as commander - in - chief			2
' @entity112 said the @entity57 believes it has ' good relationships with the military leaders			0
' ' and most importantly the president has an open ear , and values their input around the table or over the telephone , ' he stated			0
the president has nominated former @entity5 official @entity144 to serve as the next secretary of defense			1
he 's expected to undergo a smooth confirmation process			0
senators on the @entity148 will question @entity144 next week			0
a vote of the full @entity26 on his nomination will likely come soon after that , allowing @entity18 to finally leave his post more than two months after formally offering the president his resignation			1
@entity18 said today that he 'd ' cherished ' leading the @entity5 , but ' of all the opportunities my life has given me , i am most proud of having once been a soldier ' despite alleged differences that ultimately cost @entity18 his job , @entity0 had nothing but praise for the 68 - year - old veteran at this afternoon 's ceremony			1
thanks to @entity18 's ' guiding hand , ' @entity0 said today , the @entity5 is ' better positioned for the future			1
' his ' greatest impact ' perhaps , @entity0 said , ' a legacy that will be felt for decades to come ' is the example he set for the nation 's men and women in uniform			2
' it ’s not simply that you ’ve been the first enlisted combat veteran and the first @entity179 veteran to serve as secretary of defense			0
it ’s how your life experience - being down in the mud , feeling the bullets fly overhead - has allowed you to connect with our troops like no other secretary before you			0
' @entity0 said he 's ' grateful to @entity2 on a very personal level			2
' ' exactly 10 years ago this month , i joined you in the @entity26 , along with the vice president , ' he recalled			1
' i was new and green ; you were a veteran legislator			0
i was the student , and you shared some of the lessons of your service			0
i was young and you were ...			0
well , ' he trailed off , eliciting laughter from attendees			0
speaking before the president , gen. @entity201 , chairman of the @entity202 , heaped on @entity18 's ' incredible ' and ' remarkable ' record of service			1
' his resolve is simply as solid as steel , ' @entity201 said , ' but his love of his country is even stronger			0
' vice president @entity210 , another former colleague of @entity18 's in the @entity26 , said the outgoing defense head has the type of ' integrity ' that everyone who has ever served with him in any capacity agrees ' is recognizable immediately			1
' @entity210 , a close friend of @entity18 's who reportedly opposed his ousting , said he was ' truly going to personally miss ' working with his friend			1
' thank you for all you 've done ...			0
all you 've done for me , all you 've done for the country , ' @entity210 said			0
' i 'm proud to call you a friend ' he said , ' and i 'm proud to stand by you as a secretary of defense about to retire			2
' @entity18 told gen. @entity224 , chairman of the @entity202 , right , ' i have been very fortunate to have you as my partner in this job			2
especially during those spirited " self - help " and " educational " opportunities called congressional hearings ' after @entity0 's remarks , @entity18 took the stage and thanked @entity0 for allowing him to serve on his cabinet for the last two years			1
to @entity201 he said , ' i have been very fortunate to have you as my partner in this job			0
' especially during those spirited " self - help " and " educational " opportunities called congressional hearings , ' he joked			0
he additionally thanked his wife , @entity237 , and replacement @entity144 , whom he commended for his previous service at the @entity5 and ' for his continued commitment to public service			2
' @entity18 also set aside a few minutes of his speech to offer his view on international affairs			2
' we must recognize that there is not an immediate answer to every problem ' , he said that some challenges require the ' patience to seek higher ground ' to get the intended results			0
the world is not ' moving toward less complicated ' challenges , he said , in fact , challenges are becoming more global , and countries need to focus on how to ' solve problems through coalitions of common interests			0
' ' with all of the world 's trials and problems it is still a hopeful world , this i believe , ' he concluded			0
@entity18 said he 'd ' cherished ' leading the @entity5 , but ' of all the opportunities my life has given me , i am most proud of having once been a soldier			1
' the lessons from my time in uniform about trust , responsibility , duty , judgment , and loyalty to your fellow soldier ... these i have carried with me throughout my life , ' he remarked .			2

' i have so profoundly benefited from that candor , ' @entity0 said today in a speech commemorating @entity18 's 30 years of service
@entity0 fondly recalled their time serving in the @entity26 together and called @entity18 a ' friend ' ; he avoided turning the celebration into a haranguing
@entity18 resigned from his post in november , reportedly under pressure from the president himself , after less than two years
the outgoing @entity5 head said he 'd ' cherished ' leading *dod* but ' i am most proud of having once been a soldier '
