when the @entity1 team sheet for @entity3 ’s first competitive game against @entity4 was released an hour or so before kick - off , one name stood out : @entity7			1
this was last september and the beginning of the @entity11 qualifying campaign			2
it was the start of a new , bright , vibrant era under the inspirational @entity15 man			0
@entity17 ’s midfield dynamo felt like a peculiar addition			0
he had been around the block since his debut against the same opponents in 2013 but never started a match with points at stake			2
midfielder @entity7 is in the reckoning to line up against @entity26 on sunday this was @entity3 making his point and giving a player previously overlooked a chance to make his own point , too			1
@entity7 provided energy and forward thinking alongside @entity34 and @entity35 in a three - man midfield			1
being left - footed , he also brought balance to the centre of the park			0
he was given the ultimate compliment by the manager when he was rested for the 7 - 0 stroll at home to @entity44 in october so he would be ready to help stifle @entity45 a few days later			1
when he failed to start any of the four @entity17 games between the 1 - 1 draw in @entity49 and the november date with @entity50 , it was no surprise @entity7 was left on the bench at @entity53 before being introduced in the second half			1
and while his last start in the @entity57 came on january 18 , circumstances may dictate that he is in the reckoning to line out against @entity26 on sunday			1
@entity59 has been unable to join up with the squad at all through injury while @entity62 returned to @entity63 on wednesday because of his groin complaint			1
@entity7 , though , is n’t feeling as if he ’s a shoo - in to step back into the starting @entity65 ‘ i do n’t think you can ever [ think like that ] , there are lads who have been here a long time and you can never rest on your laurels			1
you have to come back and show the manager you ’re willing and able , and are still working hard for a place , ’ he insisted			0
@entity7 made his last start in the @entity57 on january 18 ‘ no one is guaranteed a starting spot , the squad is stronger than ever with some great additions and the manager will have some headaches			2
’ @entity26 may be the group leaders having set the cat amongst the pigeons by beating @entity45 , but the @entity83 maintains @entity1 must be the ones to set the tempo and impose themselves on the visitors			1
‘ every game is a must - win game , you want to win all these games and try to get as good a lead as possible			0
but it does n’t work like that with such a tough and strong group , ’ said @entity7			2
‘ it is a big game , we know how big it is , there ’s no point in beating around the bush			0
but we ’ll go out and do our best			0
‘ we ’ll leave no stone unturned and do all our tactics , and then we ’ll go out and do our job			0
there ’s no point in just talking about it and looking at the videos , we ’ve got to get on the ball and bring the game to them , ’ the 28 - year - old continued			0
‘ i think everyone is a little bit surprised with @entity45 , they ’ve had a sluggish start and it ’s a bit of a hangover from last summer			2
in @entity116 football at the minute , any team can beat anyone but you ’ve just got to be the best team on the day and hopefully that will come good for us on sunday			0
’ @entity50 and @entity45 are both highly likely to win this weekend against @entity44 and @entity4 respectively , so there is little room for error with @entity1 level on seven points with them both			1
‘ i think we can see that , it does n’t take a scientist to work that out , ’ @entity7 added			2
‘ but maybe it ’s the team that just limits the mistakes and capitalise on their home form that will progress			0
