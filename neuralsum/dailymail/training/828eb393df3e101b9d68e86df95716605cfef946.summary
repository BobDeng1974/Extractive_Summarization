@entity0 has joined calls for @entity2 to face the axe as hosts of the 2018 @entity5 as part of tougher sanctions over the shooting down of @entity11 flight @entity9 over eastern @entity12			1
the deputy prime minister said it was ' unthinkable ' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the @entity17 for supplying arms to the separatist rebels accused of causing the deaths of all 298 on board			1
@entity22 this week ruled out calls from some @entity25 politicians for @entity2 to be boycotted , insisting the tournament could be ' a force for good '			1
demand : @entity0 has called for @entity2 to be stripped of the right to host the 2018 @entity5 call : @entity0 has demanded that @entity2 be stripped of the right to host the 2018 @entity5 as the @entity17 continue to blame at @entity2 for causing the shooting down of @entity11 flight @entity9 , killing 298 people axe : deputy prime minister @entity0 says it is ' unthinkable ' that @entity2 could be allowed to host the @entity5 but mr @entity0 told @entity35 that allowing it to go ahead without a change of course by president @entity39 would make the world look ' so weak and so insincere ' in its condemnation of @entity43 's annexation of @entity44 and support for the rebels			1
the @entity47 has added another 15 individuals and 18 entities to the list of those subject to asset freezes and ambassadors in @entity53 are expected to extend the punitive actions to state - owned banks ' access to capital markets and to the arms and energy sectors			0
mr @entity0 said however that sporting events should also be part of the package of measures - including the cancellation of @entity2 's first @entity65 , which is due to take place in @entity67 in october			1
' @entity39 himself has to understand that he ca n't have his cake and eat it , ' he said			0
hosts : @entity2 president @entity39 ( left ) with @entity22 president @entity72 ( centre ) at @entity75 final ' he ca n't constantly , you know , push the patience of the international community beyond breaking point , destabilise a neighbouring country , protect these armed separatists in the east of @entity12 and still have the privilege and honour of receiving all the accolades in 2018 for being the host nation of the @entity5			1
' that 's why i 've come to the view that if he does n't change course it 's just not on , the idea that @entity2 will host the @entity5 in 2018			2
' you ca n't have this - the beautiful game marred by the ugly aggression of @entity2 on the @entity2 @entity12 border			2
' not only would @entity39 exploit it , i think it would make the rest of the world look so weak and so insincere about our protestations about @entity39 's behaviour if we 're not prepared to pull the plug			1
' bid : @entity2 won the right to host the 2018 @entity5 and @entity107 was given the 2022 edition of the tournament he said that despite @entity114 boss @entity113 's insistence that there was no case for abandoning the @entity117 , ' the question marks i 'm raising will only increase over the next coming weeks and months , over the summer and up to the @entity117 , about @entity2 's entitlement to host these major events			2
' @entity39 is a past master at attending these sporting events and , sort of , pretending almost as if everything 's utterly normal and nothing untoward is happening around him			2
' and if anyone needed any reminding of how dangerous this conflict is in the heart of @entity127 , just ask any of the family and relatives of those loved ones they lost in that plane incident last week			0
' mr @entity0 said the threat of withdrawing the @entity5 would be ' a very potent political and symbolic sanction '			0
dedicated : @entity134 and @entity135 were on their way to support @entity138 in @entity139 commemoration : @entity138 manager @entity141 ( left ) and captain @entity142 ( right ) lay wreaths in memory of supports @entity134 and @entity135 who lost their lives on @entity11 flight @entity9 tributes : flowers and shirts have been left at @entity151 in remembrance of the @entity138 fans ' if there 's one thing that @entity39 cares about , as far as i can see , it 's his sense of status			1
' maybe reminding him that you ca n't retain the same status in the world if you ignore the rest of the world , maybe that will have some effect on his thinking			0
' he did not rule out the @entity167 as an alternative host given its recent history of putting on successful global sporting events			0
' we 've got the stadiums , we 've got the infrastructure , and we 've got the public backing and enthusiasm to host it , ' he said			0
' that 's a decision for other people			0
but i 'm not saying this just as a , sort of , @entity167 land grab to snatch the @entity5 from under @entity39 's nose			0
