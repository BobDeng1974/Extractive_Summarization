by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 striker @entity2 admits he has to prove his worth next season after missing seven months of his maiden campaign through injury			1
the @entity8 international sustained a knee injury in october which prevented him from playing again , meaning he managed just six appearances without a goal after his Â£ 6million move from @entity13 last summer			1
@entity2 is to forego a lengthy summer holiday to ensure he is back to full fitness by the time pre-season comes around			1
struggle : injuries have stopped @entity2 making the impact he would have liked at @entity3 ' the most important thing is for me to be in the best possible shape i can be for the start of next season , ' he told @entity25			1
' i have decided not to go on a big holiday , i am staying in @entity27 to work hard over the summer period , so i can hit the ground running when pre-season starts in july			0
' this season has been pretty much a non-starter for me so next season is when it starts			0
' it all about working hard so the fans can see the best of @entity2			2
' it is going to mean an awful lot to me to wear that shirt next season because i 've not made my mark in the club 's history			2
' the season coming for me is where i have to prove my worth and i am ready to take on that challenge			0
' boss : @entity2 followed @entity46 in moving from @entity13 to @entity3 last summer ironically @entity2 believes he was just starting to find his form in his fifth @entity49 substitute appearance when he sustained the injury against @entity51 - against whom he came closest to scoring his first goal when he hit the post - on october 19			1
and unfortunately for him in his absence the team played the sort of football he thinks will benefit his style of play			1
' i realised the fans and coaching staff were waiting to see the best of @entity2 and around that time i felt i was coming into a bit of form so it was an extra disappointment , ' the 30 - year - old added			2
' as a team @entity3 have had a fantastic season which gives me a huge motivation to prepare for next season			1
' on a personal side , it has not gone as i 'd hoped			0
i look back with a bit of pain and regret			0
' i have not played as many games as i would have liked due to this injury			0
it is something i never thought would have happened			0
' it is painful to sit in the stands and watch			0
' i would often say to myself that the style of play i was watching would suit me down to the ground			2
' you turn that around and it is a positive and hopefully we can make next season more successful than this one has been			0
' high hopes : @entity2 plans to spend this summer getting fit in order to recapture his form from @entity13			1

@entity2 hoping to return to pre-season at @entity3 fully fit
former @entity13 striker spent seven months *sidelined* through injury
believes @entity46 's style of play will benefit his own game
hopes next season can be even better for @entity3 than this one
