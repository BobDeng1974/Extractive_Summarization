by @entity0 @entity1 thinks she had been denied her pension because of a lack of understanding of her rare , incurable condition , @entity6 a mother has been left struggling to survive after a police force failed to give her pension in case her incurable condition suddenly improves			1
@entity1 , 40 , suffers constant pain from @entity6 ( @entity6 ) - a rare and poorly understood chronic pain condition			1
she was dismissed due to ill health from @entity14 where she had worked as a team leader in the control room for more than 11 years			1
mrs @entity1 , who managed up to 17 members of staff , understood she would qualify to receive her pension early			1
but since leaving her post in may last year the force has refused to give her any financial support - saying she might be well enough to work again before she is 65			1
the distraught mother - of - one blames a lack of understanding about her debilitating condition for leaving her family struggling to get by			1
mrs @entity1 , of @entity27 , @entity28 , said : ' initially they were good to me and helped me where they can			1
i worked from home for a while but eventually they dismissed me			1
' i was led to believe that if i was dismissed on ill health grounds then i would be able to claim my pension			1
they talked as if i was going to get it			0
i have gone into remission once but i have done lots of research and it is very unlikely to happen again			0
' mrs @entity1 was diagnosed with @entity6 after a skiing accident when she was 16 - years - old			1
she has had 25 operations trying to alleviate the condition , but nothing has worked			1
she is on the highest prescribable dose of @entity48 - a synthetic painkiller of codeine and morphine - to try and make day - to - day living bearable			0
mother - of - one @entity52 and her husband @entity53 have criticised claims by her former employer @entity14 that her condition may suddenly improve but she is still so sore she can not enjoy hugging her seven - year - old son @entity57			1
she added : ' the drugs only take the edge off the pain			0
' it started off feeling like i have a dagger twisting in my knee and now it affects most of my leg and feels like my whole leg is on fire and i ca n’t put it out			0
' i just want to be doing all the things you take for granted with a little boy			0
i want to be taking him to the park , playing , cuddling			0
' mrs @entity1 said she was told in july last year that her application for a pension had been declined on the grounds that the independent expert who assessed her had said she may recover by the time she is 65			1
the practitioner wrote : ' the evidence supports that at the current time her symptoms would prevent her from doing her substantive role but not that she has a reduced likelihood of being capable of undertaking any gainful employment before her normal retirement age			2
' mrs @entity1 appealed the decision and was referred to a second independent medical practitioner but she lost her case			2
@entity6 usually develops after an injury , often a minor injury			2
the pain is often unconnected to the seriousness of the injury and can be out of all proportion from what the sufferer would expect			0
the condition is little - understood , but some medical experts think it is caused by damage to the nervous system , which causes nerves to misfire in some way , triggering pain			2
if left untreated the pain can spread to other parts of the body too			0
some sufferers have repeated episodes of pain followed by stretches of pain - free remission			0
it can be treated by physiotherapy , to prevent muscle wasting , certain types of painkillers and counselling to help people cope with the chronic pain			0
however , @entity6 expert @entity118 , consultant nurse at the @entity119 who treat mrs @entity1 , said : ' every person with @entity6 presents differently and has a different prognosis			1
' we would expect 70 per cent of patients to get back to work - but it depends on the speed of diagnosis			0
' we saw mrs @entity1 when she was about 15 years down the line			1
i do not believe mrs @entity1 would be fit enough to return to an office - based job			2
' there is a problem with early diagnosis			0
some gps have never seen this condition before			0
' @entity53 , 46 , who runs a property maintenance business , said : ' i think it 's absolutely disgraceful that they have n’t given @entity140 her pension			2
' many cases of @entity6 are misdiagnosed , but it is estimated that one in 3,800 people in the @entity146 suffer from the condition and three in four of those are women			1
@entity14 said : ' we are not able to comment on individual cases , though can confirm that the organisation both meets and , in some cases exceeds , the guidelines set out by the @entity154 ( @entity154 )			2
' @entity156 has no discretion around the regulations outlined in the @entity160 policy and , should someone fail to meet the criteria for benefits within the scheme , the decision can not be overturned by any individual within the organisation			0
' @entity14 will fully cooperate with any complaint made to the @entity168			2
' under @entity171 guidelines employers can dismiss staff if they can not fulfill their role and there are ' no reasonable adjustments that can be made ' .			0
