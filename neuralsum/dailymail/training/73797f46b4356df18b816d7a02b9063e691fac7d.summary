by @entity0 published : 05:00 est , 5 september 2013 updated : 05:47 est , 5 september 2013 a headmistress has been suspended after her all - girls school was branded a ' real life @entity3 ' by parents due to her pupils running riot in lessons			1
@entity9 , 54 , was sent home on full pay from her £ 60,000 - a - year job after a damning report exposed a ' core ' of unruly students which left classmates living in fear			1
a snap inspection found the teenage ladettes were involved in a string of bullying incidents and there were reports of brawling , food fights , swearing at teachers , smoking and truancy going unchecked			0
one large group of girls which had gathered in the playground only dispersed once a police officer had been called to stand amongst them			0
inspectors from @entity48 found there were eight expulsions in less than a year at the 990 pupil @entity51 in @entity32 where the motto is : ' more opportunities to succeed			1
' they said there was a ' rapid deterioration ' in behaviour in a few months			1
the investigation - carried out after a complaint from a parent - came after the school announced plans to spend £ 220,000 buying @entity64 for every pupil to help with homework - and ' engage ' with teachers			1
earlier this year mrs @entity9 had also been praised by council bosses by saving the local library from closure by offering to use it for the part of each day as a ' satellite school ' for youngsters who need extra teaching - and pay for the upkeep			1
today her school was in special measures after the sudden surge in bad behaviour after inspectors gave it a grade 4 rating - the worst it can possibly give out - and branded it ' inadequate ' and ' requiring improvement			1
' running riot : @entity48 inspectors found a ' core ' of students running riot and truancy going unchecked at the school bad behavior : @entity92 was consistently going ignored , while swearing and race - fuelled fights were common said the inspectors it led to comparisons to @entity98 ’s - a fictional girls ’ boarding school , originally created by a cartoonist in the 1940s which later became the subject of hit movies			1
one parent said : ' we ’re absolutely astounded at what happened to @entity108 because until recently it had been doing so well			0
it had got good grades in previous @entity48 reports and for all intents and purposes looked as if it was improving all the time			1
' but something has gone wrong and now it ’s like something out of the @entity98 ’s movies			0
we ’ve heard all sorts of reports of small group girls running wild at the school and its impacted on everybody else			2
' some of the youngsters said they did n’t even feel safe going there any more			0
@entity129 knows how it has got to this			0
maybe the head has simply taken her eye off the ball			0
' @entity48 called the unannounced inspection on july 3 after a parent complained about the behaviour of pupils			1
three inspectors spoke to 100 girls and observed lessons and break times			2
they also observed 19 lessons , several break times and read 16 responses to a survey			0
their report found behaviour had declined sharply since a previous inspection last october in which inspectors said the school was ' consistently good ' and that students were ' courteous , polite and generally cheerful towards adults , visitors and each other			1
' in the latest report the inspectors said : ' there has been a rapid deterioration in behaviour			1
a core group of students has disengaged from their education and show no respect for teachers or their fellow students			2
out of the movies : angry parents have compared the school to @entity3 - which has become the topic of several films , including a 2007 production staring @entity174 ' they cause widespread disruption to learning and an unsafe learning environment resulting in eight permanent exclusions in the academic year to date			2
' responses from parents show that approximately one third of parents disagree that their child feels safe in school and approximately half disagree that the school ensures students are well behaved			2
' behaviour logs from this year show regular reports of unacceptable behaviour including students truanting from lessons , leaving the school site , refusing to go to lessons , smoking , and swearing at teachers			1
' some students have been removed from lessons over 30 times this year and one student more than 80 times - a clear illustration that the behaviour system is not working			1
' many students have no confidence in the ability of the school to combat bullying effectively			2
consequently , some bullying goes unreported and is allowed to continue			0
' many students feel unsafe in school due to a wide variety of intolerable behaviours including , fighting , congestion and pushing on the stairs , teachers leaving classes unattended , teachers behaving aggressively towards students ; and food and drinks being thrown			1
' the majority of students behaved well in front of inspectors			2
other students were observed at lunch - time , throwing drinks , congregating in a big group , swearing , talking and filming on mobile phones			0
' the big group of students only dispersed once a number of staff had spoken to them and the police officer stood in the middle of them			0
inspiration : the fictional @entity98 was originally created as a cartoon in the 1940s and inspired the 1980s film @entity245 , above ' leaders and managers do not effectively prevent bullying and many students spoken to by inspectors feel that staff are unable to protect them and control those whose behaviour is disruptive and dangerous			1
' the report says most senior leaders at the school were ' unaware ' of the scale of the bullying and had ' an over generous ' view of the quality of teaching due to inaccurate feedback from staff			2
it went on : ' teaching is often not good enough , giving rise to the underachievement of white @entity268 girls and students who are disabled or have special educational needs			2
' a number of students are unable to explore their learning independently of teachers because they do not have a strong grasp of @entity276			0
this is compounded by the fact that not all teachers are sufficiently confident in integrating literacy support into their teaching			0
' furthermore , some students who do have a good grasp of @entity276 have insufficient understanding of specialist vocabulary used by the teacher , which excludes them from learning			0
' mrs @entity9 , who had been in post for four years , will remain off work pending an investigation by the school governors			1
girls on film : the school was also central to film @entity297 , pictured above in a recent message to parents she said : ' our mission at @entity51 is to maximise achievement for each individual child			1
' we believe in the potential of every young person who attends @entity51			2
to do this they will need a high level of skills , a strong work ethic and confidence in themselves			0
this is at the heart of all we do			0
' our school is characterised by high expectations for both achievement and behaviour and our expectations of the quality of teaching in the classroom are as high as our expectations of our students ’ work			1
' last may the school decided to spend money on @entity64 for every pupil this month and all its 80 teachers to help “ engage the children much more in their lessons			1
' the ipad 4 model currently retails for £ 389 although school managers haggled down the price to £ 220 per unit - putting the total cost at more than £ 220,000			0
today @entity338 , headteacher at the neighbouring @entity339 , who has been appointed executive head at @entity108 , said : ' a thorough review has been carried out of the school ’s behaviour and safeguarding policies			2
' these have been updated , clarified and strengthened and all staff have been given additional training in safeguarding			0
nobody will be in any doubt about the standards of behaviour which are expected from them			0
they will also know who to speak to if they do have any concerns and can be reassured that these will be dealt with appropriately			0
' we are committed to listening to students , having already sought their views , and will be carrying out online surveys on a regular basis to ensure things have improved			0
' @entity365 , @entity32 council ’s director of education and skills , said : ' @entity369 and decisive measures were taken as soon as the failures the including light , to came to light			1
' we are working with the governing body to ensure that strengthened and robust governance is in place to help the school move forwards			0
