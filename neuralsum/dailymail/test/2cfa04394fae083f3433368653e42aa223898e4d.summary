@entity1 champion @entity0 wants to return to the @entity2 after her hit debut appearance with @entity5 co-star @entity6 at @entity7 but her packed schedule will make it difficult			1
a huge @entity2 fan , @entity0 made her first in - ring performance on march 29 in front of almost 77,000 people in @entity14 in @entity15 and admits she caught the bug			1
@entity0 told retired wrestling legend @entity19 's @entity18 podcast that ' there 's nothing like ' @entity2 but she is focussed on her upcoming fight against fierce @entity1 rival @entity23			1
@entity0 wants to ' find a way ' to return to the @entity2 after taking down co-owner @entity25 @entity0 was a hot with fans at @entity7 but her focus for now is on her fight against @entity23 ' i need to find a way ( to return ) , but i have a lot of stuff going on			1
i 'm fighting august 1st , ' @entity0 said ahead of her 12th @entity1 fight in @entity33			1
' @entity34 , the kind of beating @entity23 is going to get in @entity36 is nothing compared to anything anyone can make up in the meantime			2
' so i ca n't make anyone excited about anything while that fight is looming over my head			0
' fans were ecstatic when @entity0 helped @entity6 take down @entity45 , otherwise known as @entity2 co-owner @entity25 and @entity46 , who she threw over her shoulder with what looked like a trademark judo move , on the @entity51 on march 29			1
@entity52 said : ' i 've never seen @entity46 hip - tossed any better			0
' @entity1 women 's bantamweight champion @entity0 appeared with @entity54 co-star @entity6 @entity0 's focus is on her much - anticipated @entity1 bout against also undefeated @entity23 ( left ) in @entity36 on the following evening 's @entity61 , when former @entity1 champion @entity59 made his entrance , they chanted @entity0 's name			1
@entity0 admitted she had been given the most high - profile of introduction to the @entity2 crowd			2
' i hit the ground running ... the first i ever wrestled was at @entity7 with an attendance record at @entity14 , ' she told @entity52 , whose nickname @entity0 she took for herself with his blessing			1
' i had a problem when i left though			0
there 's no way i ca n't not go back in there again			2
after experiencing that , there 's nothing like it			0
' the second i left i was already thinking , ' how can i possibly go back ? ' i did n't even change yet			0
i had n't even gotten out of my outfit yet			0
' @entity0 tweeted ' we 're just gettin ' started ' after the event fuelling speculation for a return however her agent @entity87 told @entity89 ' @entity88 that it was just a one - off			2
@entity0 throws @entity46 over her shoulder and into the canvas as @entity6 watches on in the hit appearance speaking to @entity52 about the differences between @entity2 and @entity1 , @entity0 said it was about the ' uncertainty of the fight '			1
' i do n't know exactly what 's going to happen , ' she said of @entity1 , even though a predicted early attack in her last fight out led to her ending @entity101 's night after a record 14 seconds			2
' i do n't know if i 'm going to get really hurt , ' she continues			0
' i do n't know what they 're going to come out with			0
my mind is still running over a million things that could possibly happen , whereas when i know exactly what 's going to go down ( in @entity2 ) , roughly , because it did n't go down exactly as i thought			2
i 'm like , ' ok , this is the way it 's going to be and if it 's going to be this way i 'm not going to screw it up			0
' ' whereas in a fight , i 'm like , ' do n't get stuck in a certain way			0
it can go any way so do n't screw it up			0
' it 's a different kind of anxiety , for sure			0
' from dangerous to demure , @entity0 poses in front of a fast car at the premiere of @entity54 @entity0 flies in for a punch on @entity122 in their highly acclaimed @entity5 fight scene after some high - profile movie roles , including the blockbuster @entity5 release that includes an epic fight scene with @entity122 , and the completion of her book my fight , @entity132 ( out in may ) , @entity0 's focus returns to her day job as the headline bout for @entity1 190			1
her @entity1 bantamweight title will be up for grabs at the @entity138 against @entity23 , who is also undefeated in the @entity140 and has been campaigning for a title shot with taunts at the expense of @entity0 's ' @entity145 ' friends			1
' this fight is not going to be short , ' @entity0 told @entity52			1
' i do n't want her walking out of there the same way she she when she walked in			0
