by @entity0 published : 19:40 est , 17 march 2013 updated : 20:18 est , 17 march 2013 @entity1 and @entity2 pictured at their home in @entity5 @entity2 always felt her husband @entity1 lived in his own world			1
even during the most emotionally charged moments of their relationship , he could appear oddly detached and preoccupied with irrelevant practical details			2
' our daughter @entity12 is 18 weeks old , and i had an extremely difficult labour which resulted in an emergency caesarean , ' says @entity2 , 41			1
' i was terrified , but @entity1 seemed unaffected by the danger			2
he was calm and even cracking jokes , which made me angry			2
but i know he was n't being like that on purpose - it 's simply how he is			1
' to many women , @entity2 's frustration at her husband 's insensitivity will sound all too familiar			1
yet the traits she finds most frustrating in @entity1 are due to more than just stereotypical male behaviour			2
she now knows they are the result of @entity33 's syndrome , a form of autism sometimes referred to as a ' hidden disability ' because the symptoms are not always immediately apparent			1
it means @entity1 , 46 , an accountant from @entity37 , @entity5 , can have problems with social interaction and communication			1
people with @entity33 's can often misread signals and say or do what many people would regard as inappropriate			1
@entity45 says : ' he is very precise and pedantic - if you ask him how he is , he will tell you in great detail			2
or if you ask him how something works , he will give you so much information and talk for such a long time it can be baffling			0
i 'm used to it , but i can see people who do n't know him looking bewildered			0
' @entity1 says : ' growing up i knew i was different , but i was never diagnosed			1
i did n't fit in			0
at the age of eight , i had a reading age of six			0
i also had a speech problem in that i spoke much too fast , and i was diagnosed with dyslexia			1
but i never let it hold me back , and i was always excellent at maths			0
' one in 125 people in @entity63 have been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder and experts are seeing a marked increase in the numbers of adults being diagnosed with @entity33 's , particularly men , who are affected four times as often as women			1
@entity33 's sufferers are often highly intelligent and their forensic attention to detail and ability to focus can make them extremely successful in their careers			1
yet the condition can have a damaging impact on personal relationships			1
they often struggle to pick up emotional signals from their partners and find it hard to understand how they can make them happy			0
for some men , getting a diagnosis of @entity33 's can mean the difference between their relationship breaking down - or not			1
' a lot of men in their mid- 40s are being diagnosed , ' says @entity92 , from the @entity93			1
' we 've got much better at identifying the condition in young people , and often it 's the case that a child will be diagnosed and then the family will recognise the traits in the father , too			1
' @entity33 can make navigating two people 's needs in a relationship difficult			1
if women do n't understand why their husbands appear unfeeling , it can be hurtful			0
often , a diagnosis brings relief to the person with @entity33 's and their family , because it helps explain problems they 've faced			1
' @entity2 said of her husband @entity1 : ' he is very precise and pedantic - if you ask him how he is , he will tell you in great detail			1
or if you ask him how something works , he will give you so much information and talk for such a long time it can be baffling ' when @entity1 discovered he had @entity33 's , it made sense of the behaviour @entity2 had noticed since their relationship began a decade ago			1
' when we met , i was struck by his intelligence , but i also noticed he has problems remembering instructions or retaining the order of a list , ' she says			0
' he is extremely precise , which is why he 's such a good accountant , and he is never happier than poring for hours over his spreadsheets			1
he 's very good with money and running the family budget			2
' @entity2 says @entity1 is a loving , hands - on father to their five children ; @entity142 , seven , @entity143 , six , @entity144 , four , @entity145 , two , and baby @entity12			1
it was after @entity144 was diagnosed with autism at the age of two that @entity1 realised he was on the @entity33 's spectrum , and @entity2 believes his condition has helped him bond with @entity144			1
' but his behaviour can be frustrating , ' she says			0
' when you say something to him , he will often take it literally , and when people ask him a question , he 'll give an extremely fulsome answer			0
' @entity92 , from the @entity93 , outlines ten symptoms to watch out for : 1			0
limited interests or preoccupation with a subject3			0
low understanding of the reciprocal rules of conversation ; interrupting , dominating , not participating or shifting the topic4			0
insensitivity to the non-verbal cues of others ( stance , posture , facial expressions ) 5			0
literal interpretation of instructions 7			0
compelling need to finish one task before starting another @entity1 says : ' it was a shock to discover i had @entity33 's , but things fell into place			1
i know people can be bewildered about how i function			0
it has helped me understand the way i am , and it helps @entity2 make allowances for the way i react in certain situations			1
' not every couple manages @entity33 's so successfully , however			1
@entity190 is an author and therapist who specialises in marriage counselling for couples in which one or both partners has the condition			2
she says : ' i see a number of highly intelligent , successful men including pilots , policemen and company directors			0
often they 're the expert at what they do , but when they get home , they 're in an emotional environment and out of their comfort zone			0
they often retreat - perhaps by spending hours on the computer , or leaving the house for a few days - which can send their wife into a state of confusion , assuming it 's because of them			2
the men would love to make their wife happy , but they simply do n't know how			0
' many couples are referred to @entity190 after counselling has failed			0
' it can be damaging , because it focuses on trying to get men to talk about their emotions and think about the impact of their behaviour on their partner 's feelings , but people with @entity33 's ca n't do that			1
their wives are left thinking : “ he 's not making an effort to make things better			2
” marriages are pushed to breaking point			0
' @entity240 and @entity242 's marriage was in crisis when they began visiting @entity190 for counselling			1
the couple , both 52 , from @entity246 , realised @entity242 had @entity33 's when their youngest son was diagnosed with the condition at the age of ten			1
as an electronics engineer , @entity242 was successful , but found socialising difficult and was struggling to communicate with his wife			1
she says : ' i knew he was a sensitive man , so i could n't understand why he would behave like an inconsiderate idiot			0
i 'd ask him to do something and he would n't ; he could n't put himself in my shoes			0
it was as though i was speaking @entity258 and he was speaking @entity259			0
' @entity33 's sufferers are often highly intelligent and extremely successful in their careers , yet the condition can have a damaging impact on personal relationships @entity240 once found her husband 's trousers in the freezer			1
it was a hot day and he 'd thought it was a sensible way to cool them down before putting them on			0
when they were listening to a radio concerto , he said halfway through : ' the lead violinist has changed			0
' afterwards , the presenter said one of the strings on the lead violinist 's bow had snapped so the second violinist had taken over			2
' he 'd noticed the change because his hearing is so acute			0
if he 's listening to music , he has to have silence around him , or he feels bombarded by noise and ca n't cope			2
' if @entity240 is watching tv in another room , she has to have it turned down low and the door closed			1
he has to sleep with ear plugs in and the windows shut			0
' he has had jobs where he 's struggled because he sees no need to say hello to people every morning , for example - he feels if he 's said it to someone once , what 's the point in repeating it day after day			2
he has no concept of social niceties			0
' she says he can come across as defensive to the point of aggression			0
' he hates socialising and is very literal - if i asked how i looked , he 'd tell me in frank terms			0
but he would n't understand why i got upset when he told me i looked fat , for example			0
' but @entity240 says @entity33 's has also given @entity242 attractive qualities , such as his phenomenal memory , his drive and passion for music			1
she felt @entity242 depended on her , yet her emotional support was not reciprocated			1
@entity240 says : ' i 've learned to be more direct when i 'm speaking to @entity242 , and i 've also found it easier to accept his behaviour for what it is			1
i know it 's not his fault he responds logically rather than emotionally			2
it can be lonely giving support and not getting much back			0
i cope because i love him			0
' @entity2 has come to view @entity1 's @entity33 's as a blessing in disguise			1
' when @entity144 was diagnosed , we did some online tests to check for autistic tendencies			2
i found i am at the other end of the spectrum to autism - i 'm creative , impulsive and emotional			2
so @entity1 's calmness , precision and air of detachment balances me out			2
' i feel lucky to be married to @entity1			0
he 's a wonderful husband and father			2
he 's worked hard over the years to understand emotions better and be a good listener , and i find his unique way of looking at the world fascinating			2
i 'd never change him			0
