an aborted theatre tour of the cult @entity1 programme @entity1 is still the subject of legal action more than two years after four shows were cancelled			1
entertainer @entity6 , a close friend of soccer saturday regular @entity7 , arranged the abandoned roadshow			1
he continues to pursue presenter @entity10 for breach of contract			1
presenter @entity10 is being pursued for breach of contract over a soccer saturday theatre tour @entity6 claims to have lost £ 250,000 after dates in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 were cancelled following successful shows in @entity21 and @entity22			1
it is claimed ticket sales suffered after @entity10 failed to fulfil promises to promote the show			1
it is believed the marathon legal row has strained relationships on the programme , with @entity6 also said to have contracts in place with @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 , as well as @entity7			1
@entity6 said : ‘ these things take a long time to resolve but i ’m not giving up			1
’ @entity1 are aware of the dispute but say they are not involved , even though the roadshow used the official soccer saturday brand			2
@entity41 has not taken charge of a @entity44 fixture since october 25 @entity44 referee @entity41 looks still to be paying the price for going in his own car to an @entity48 concert after a match — and taking a call from manager @entity51 en route — rather than leaving in the official transport			1
@entity41 , a @entity54 referee and widely regarded as one of the best in @entity57 , was stood down for one match at the time			1
but he was on @entity60 duty last weekend , then relegated further to fourth official in midweek and next saturday			2
the conspiracy theory is that referees ’ chief @entity64 favours other elite officials , including @entity67 , who received no reprimand after his fiancee @entity69 travelled in the officials ’ vehicle this season			2
a source said @entity67 asked permission			2
@entity75 have appointed @entity76 to succeed @entity77 as chairman next october			2
@entity76 , who had a torrid time as ceo of @entity81 , has chaired six public companies including @entity83 and @entity84			0
but even though he has been an @entity75 member since 1995 , he has not served on any of the @entity86 ’s committees that would have given him some knowledge of the lunatic fringe who have disrupted the ground renovation			0
@entity76 , whose cricket career peaked when he beat the @entity93 prep school bowling record of @entity95 legend @entity94 , said : ‘ i ’m used to arriving from planet @entity97 but getting my feet under the table pretty quickly			0
’ @entity100 have given assurances about the sale of @entity104 tickets @entity100 , who are supply partners with @entity106 2015 , have given assurances about not selling @entity109 tickets on their controversial online secondary sites			0
but that did n’t stop @entity100 - owned get me in offloading a counterfeit pair of vip tickets for the @entity116 boxing show last saturday for £ 5,000 , with the unfortunate buyers stopped at the gate			0
@entity119 on @entity121 team former @entity122 sir @entity119 will be part of @entity121 ’s campaign team in his bid for the @entity127 presidency			0
@entity119 ’s know - how from his spell in the @entity130 with responsibility for the @entity132 and @entity133 will be utilised to unlock doors in the chase for more than 200 votes			0
sir @entity119 has yet to decide whether to stand for his @entity139 and @entity140 seat at the @entity141 next year , but currently has time on his hands to be of significant help to @entity121			0
however , the biggest diplomatic issue for @entity121 might be keeping the peace between his two warring communications and strategic chiefs @entity148 , a close adviser over @entity150 , and bid specialist @entity151 , who runs @entity121 ’s @entity152 for the @entity127 presidency			0
it ’s safe to say @entity151 and @entity148 , who surprisingly attended the @entity151 - organised launch of @entity121 ’s manifesto , do not like each other			0
spurs , who already have an influential female board presence in combative executive director @entity160 , have chosen @entity162 finance chief @entity161 to replace @entity164 - bound @entity163 as director of football administration .			1
