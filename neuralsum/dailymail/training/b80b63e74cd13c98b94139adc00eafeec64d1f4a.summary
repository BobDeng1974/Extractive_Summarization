@entity0 is to introduce a blazing fast @entity2 mobile internet service , quick enough to download a full length feature film in less than a second			1
while most of the world has yet to experience the improvements offered by @entity8 , the technologically advanced country has announced a £ 900million ( 1.6 trillion won ) in its successor			1
@entity0 's science ministry said it aims to implement the technology , which is about 1,000 times faster than the @entity12 , within six years			1
speedy : @entity0 are investing £ 900million into @entity2 wireless internet services capable of downloading an entire film in a single second @entity2 will allow users to download a 800 - megabyte movie file in one second , compared with 40 seconds using @entity12 , the science ministry said , adding that such speeds would help @entity0 firms win overseas deals			1
a ministry spokesman said : ' we helped fuel national growth with @entity28 services in the 1990s , @entity29 in the 2000s and @entity12 around 2010			1
now it is time to take preemptive action to develop @entity2			1
' ' countries in @entity35 , @entity36 and the @entity37 are making aggressive efforts to develop 5g technology ... and we believe there will be fierce competition in this market in a few years , ' it said			0
under the roadmap , a trial 5g service will be rolled out in 2017 and a fully commercial service in december 2020			1
priority will be given to developing key features for the new network , including ultra-hd and hologram transmission as well as cutting - edge social networking services			2
related industries will be able to rack up sales of @entity2 - related devices and infrastructure equipment worth 331 trillion won from 2020 to 2026 , the ministry estimated			1
the government hopes to implement the plan with investment and cooperation from operators such as @entity63 and @entity64 as well as handset makers like @entity66 and @entity67			0
it also aims to expand the telecom infrastructure equipment industry , which is relatively weaker than the mighty mobile device sector			0
led by @entity66 - the world 's top handset maker - @entity0 has a leading 30 - percent stake in the global mobile device market			1
' but the ( telecom ) infrastructure equipment industry has only a 4.4 percent share in the global market , with exports very limited , ' the ministry said			0
@entity36 equipment makers including @entity82 have expanded their presence in the global market from 12 percent in 2007 to 26 percent in 2012			0
@entity82 announced in november that it was looking at a 5g commercial rollout by 2020 , with a minimum investment of $ 600 million to develop the technology			2
@entity88 intends to take up to a 20 percent stake in the world 's telecom infrastructure equipment market by 2020 , according to the ministry			2
@entity0 's science ministry said it aims to implement the technology , which is about 1,000 times faster than the @entity12 , within six years new opportunities @entity0 is renowned for being at the forefront of internet technology with broadband speeds that consistently out - pace those in @entity35 or the @entity37			1
officials said the new service would also mean people on bullet trains running faster than 500 kilometres ( 310 miles ) an hour would even be able to access the @entity104 , compared with 300 kph currently			2
' @entity105 around the world keep getting faster , with some in @entity36 running as fast as 500 and 600 kilometres per hour , ' said one ministry official who declined to be named			0
' if we have the technology to allow fast internet access in these trains , it can open new opportunities for us globally , ' he said			0
@entity66 announced back in may that it had successfully tested @entity2 technology , managing data transmission of more than one gigabyte per second over a distance of two kilometres			2
@entity66 said it had found a way to harness millimetre - wave bands which have proved to be a sticking point for the mobile industry to date			0
the test used 64 antenna elements , which the tech titan said overcame the issue of ' unfavourable propagation characteristics ' that have prevented data travelling across long distances using the bands			0
however , it made clear that the technology would not be available commercially before the end of the decade .			0

@entity0 is now investing £ 900million in @entity2 services
trial service expected in 2017 with commercial service by december 2020
will allow users to download a @entity140 movie file in one second
speeds up to @entity142 per second are 1,000 times faster than @entity12
