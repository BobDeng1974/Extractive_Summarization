a fully - insured @entity1 woman may soon have to file for bankruptcy after she suffered cardiac arrest and was taken , while unconscious , to an emergency room that was n't in her healthcare network			1
though @entity8 's @entity7 was just three blocks away from where @entity10 was in september 2013 when she had a heart attack at just 29 , it 's not part of her @entity14 network			1
now , as @entity10 recovers from the 10 days she spent in a medically - induced coma and the other six days she spent in a cardiac unit , she must also contend with whether she 'll ever recover from its $ 50,000 price tag			1
her life was saved but she 's taken a massive hit to the wallet because of the hospital where paramedics chose to take her @entity10 was taken to @entity28 , the closest hospital to where her heart stopped at @entity29 , where she works			1
that proximity , versus the @entity31 of a mile away , cost her $ 50,000 -- and it could have been even more when a provider bills you for the difference between the provider ’s charge and the allowed amount			1
for example , if the provider ’s charge is $ 100 and the allowed amount is $ 70 , the provider may bill you for the remaining $ 30			0
a preferred provider may not balance bill you for covered services			0
balance billing is expressly permitted under the @entity47			0
source : @entity49 what seems most pointedly absurd to @entity10 , a project manager , is that she was n't even able to stop the ambulance drivers as they rushed her to @entity28 instead of her in - network @entity31 up the road			1
four tenths of a mile up the road , exactly , where her maximum co-pay would have been $ 1,500			2
' i was in a coma			0
i could n't very well wake up and say , " hey , take me to the next hospital			0
" it was the closet hospital to where i had my event , so naturally the ambulance took me there			0
no fault to them , ' the now 30 - year - old told @entity66			0
but this is not to say that @entity14 paid nothing toward @entity10 's care			1
the company says it paid its maximum for in - network care -- $ 156,000 of the original $ 254,000 charged by @entity28			2
it 's called balance billing and its 100 percent legal , even specifically allowed under the @entity47			0
that left $ 98,000 , which @entity10 successfully negotiated down to $ 9,800			0
however , as @entity66 points out , that does n't cover bills from specific doctors , for the ambulance , the therapist , etc. now the fully - insured professional is stuck with a $ 50,000 bill because of some bad timing and a few blocks			2
@entity14 says they 've done their part by covering the maximum they 'd cover for anyone and pointed to the prices at @entity28			2
@entity28 says they 've knocked off such a large amount from @entity10 's bill that they do n't plan to negotiate further			1
' it 's unfortunate that @entity96 is in network and was only three blocks away from @entity28 , ' said @entity10 , who is now desperately researching ways she might stave off bankruptcy and live the life she sees friends her age leading instead of grappling to get out of medical debt			2
sick irony : paramedics chose to take the quickest route to the nearest hospital -- @entity28 ( left ) -- to save @entity10 's life			1
a minute more in the ambulance to @entity111 ( right ) , though it could have meant life or death , would have meant a lifetime less of financial worries of healthcare costs			0

@entity10 's heart stopped at work in september 2013 and she was taken to the nearest emergency room -- @entity8 's @entity7
but @entity28 is not in @entity10 's @entity14 network -- nearby @entity31 is , however
a four - tenths of a mile difference has now cost @entity10 $ 50,000
