this footage captures the ' skin - crawling ' moment a man discovers three live grubs in an @entity4 about to be crumbled into a meal			1
@entity6 , 35 , of @entity7 , @entity8 , filmed the maggot - like creatures wriggling around on his kitchen unit after breaking the cube in front of his girlfriend , @entity14 , 22			1
another of the slimy yellow creepy crawlies was living in a second cube from the same pack - and all of the specimens have been sent to the local environmental health agency for investigation			1
' but then it looked like something was actually embedded in the cube			2
' obviously when we saw what it was i was shocked to see these maggot like things which were about to go into her dinner			2
' the cubes were bought around march this year and we 'd used about four from the pack already which is a little skin - crawling when we imagine there were more in other cubes			1
' disgusting : the creatures and remaining @entity4 cubes from the pack have been sent off to be investigated he added : ' she was making rice and was about to put the @entity4 in to give it a little bit of flavour - but noticed that the cube 's texture felt different			1
' she definitely went off her dinner after that			2
' the following day i went to crumble another cube and something pinged out of it and i almost lost sight of it			1
' mr @entity6 said the cubes had nine months left on their use - by - date but claims their texture was far more gooey than usual			1
he added : ' it 's quite possible one of them was sprinkled into a previous meal we 'd eaten , it 's not something you usually look out for			2
' and for someone who is prone to gastrointestinal distress - it does n't fill me with joy			2
' disgusting : another of the slimy yellow creepy crawlies was found in a second cube from the same pack mr @entity6 claims the cubes had nine months left on the use - by - date - but claims their texture was far more gooey than usual mr @entity6 contacted @entity85 , who make @entity4 cubes , and they requested he send them the box of cubes and the grubs so that they could investigate			1
but he instead decided to contact the environmental health agency so they could look into the incident independently			0
he added : ' i am not looking for compensation			0
@entity85 said that they would replace the cubes but i wo n't be losing sleep over that			0
' it 's more about public awareness			0
it 's unacceptable to be finding live insects in food products and if this prevents it happening again then that 's a good thing			0
a spokesman for @entity85 , who make @entity4 cubes , said : ' @entity85 takes pride in the quality of our food products and we take any complaint incredibly seriously			0
' our customer service team and mr @entity6 have recently been in contact so that we can investigate the complaint but unfortunately the product was never returned to us			1
' we understand that the @entity119 has now been informed and we are cooperating fully with their investigation			0

' the member of the public decided that he wanted the council 's environmental health team to deal with the issue on his behalf			0
' in keeping with normal procedures when a complaint relates to an item of food made somewhere else , we have contacted @entity147 and asked them to investigate			0
' we have also sent samples of the cubes to them			0
