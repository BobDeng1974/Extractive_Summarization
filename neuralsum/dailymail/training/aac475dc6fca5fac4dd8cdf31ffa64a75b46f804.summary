by @entity0 published : 13:56 est , 13 march 2014 updated : 16:09 est , 13 march 2014 @entity2 , who spread an infection that led to five hospital deaths , will not be compelled to inform @entity6 patients of his history a cardiac surgeon who spread an infection that led to five deaths in hospital will not be compelled to inform @entity6 patients of his history , the @entity8 ruled today			1
@entity2 claimed that if he was forced to disclose his past to patients , it would render ‘ his return to any meaningful practice as a cardiac surgeon impossible ’			1
the surgeon passed on a bug during heart valve surgery between december 2008 and july 2010 at the @entity24			1
the outbreak of @entity26 ( @entity27 ) a serious heart surgery complication , was found by a coroner to stem from mr @entity2 ’s habit of swapping gloves during operations			1
of 28 heart patients who had valves inserted by him , 11 had fallen ill. @entity37 , 82 , @entity38 , 67 , @entity39 , 83 , @entity40 , 73 and @entity41 , 63 , all died after contracting the staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria			0
the bug is carried on the skin , but only becomes deadly if it attaches to a foreign body , such as an artificial heart valve			0
although mr @entity2 has been ‘ demonstrably free of the outbreak since 26 may 2010 ’ , he argues that @entity24 have imposed harsh and disproportionate conditions on his return to work , including compulsory disclosure of his involvement in the scandal			1
mr @entity55 said the decision whether to inform patients of @entity2 ’s past was ‘ ultimately ' a matter for the @entity24 to determine			1
he said in his judgment : ‘ @entity61 has been working very sensibly towards a strategy which will inform the potential patients , the public , and other bodies , such as those who refer patients to the @entity68 , about the return of mr @entity2 to surgical duties			1
‘ in my judgment , that is sensible and does not involve a breach of any express or implied contractual term for at least the following reasons			0
mr @entity55 said the decision whether to inform patients of @entity2 's past was ' ultimately ' a matter for the @entity24 to determine			1
@entity78 , @entity68 in @entity79 ‘ first and foremost , patients and potential patients who may learn about mr @entity2 ’s return to work need to be reassured that that creates no unacceptable risk and that the arrangements for re-integration are robust			1
‘ given the severity of the 2008 and 2009 outbreak , and the deaths that followed , that is sensible			2
‘ secondly , the families of those who died and those who were infected but survived also have an interest in knowing that mr @entity2 is to return to surgery and the circumstances in which that is to take place			2
‘ thirdly , it is sensible from mr @entity2 ’s perspective			2
his return to surgical duties , given the circumstances of the outbreak , may be expected to generate media and public interest			0
‘ it is better that the @entity24 is prepared to deal , so far as it can , with such interest			0
‘ fourthly , those who refer patients to the @entity68 , or who have other connections with it , may legitimately have an interest in mr @entity2 ’s return to work			2
‘ ultimately , the communication strategy is a matter for the @entity24 to determine			0
the entrance to @entity118 in @entity79 , where mr @entity2 worked ‘ @entity61 , as employer , considers that mr @entity2 presents no greater risk of infection than any other cardiac surgeon and there is no requirement , from the employer ’s perspective , to require any individual surgeon or clinician to provide additional information over and above that which the individual clinician considers , in the exercise of his clinical judgment , should be provided to enable the patient to give informed consent to any proposed surgery			2
‘ individual surgeons and clinicians will therefore have to determine what information , in respect of which types of surgery , they can or should provide to their patients			0
‘ this judgment does not , and is not intended to , influence the exercise of clinical judgment by any surgeon as to what information should be provided to patients			0
’ mr @entity2 had claimed the @entity24 ’s demands were ‘ inaccurate , incomplete and misleading ' as to the nature of the risk of a @entity26 infection and the comparative risk posed by mr @entity2 and his other consultant colleagues respectively ’			1
he has been ‘ demonstrably free of the outbreak since 26 may 2010 ’			0
mr @entity2 remains happy to ‘ provide full information about the outbreak and his involvement in it to any patient who asks ’			0
the surgeon failed in his claim for ‘ loss and damage by reason of the @entity24 ’s breach of contract ’ .			0

@entity2 passed on a bug that led to five deaths between 2008 and 2010
a coroner found it was down to him swapping gloves during surgery
but judge says his @entity24 can decide whether to inform patients
