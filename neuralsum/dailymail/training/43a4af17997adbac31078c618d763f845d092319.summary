by @entity0 published : 16:56 est , 19 may 2013 updated : 17:54 est , 19 may 2013 last year was a big year for @entity1 – not least because she gave birth to her second child – and she captured it all on camera to treasure the memories forever			1
but the 300 photos were lost forever when the memory card they were saved on blew away into the sand during a trip to the beach			1
a year later , seven - year - old @entity14 was building sandcastles on the very same beach , when he came across the treasured card			1
treasure : seven year old @entity14 , managed to find a memory card on the beach at @entity21 as he walked with his dad arriving home , his father @entity23 loaded it on to the family computer and up popped 270 pictures and some video footage			1
mr @entity14 , 35 , a plumber , then embarked on an extraordinary hunt for the family in the pictures			1
first , he posted a couple of the pictures on social networking sites , asking friends if they could help him track the family down			2
he said : ‘ i had no luck so i began to zoom in on the photos and listen to the videos to see if anything could tell me who they were			2
‘ i noticed the little girl had a tag on her leg when she was born so i zoomed in and it said “ daughter of @entity1 ”			1
‘ i spent hours trailing through all of the @entity47 on @entity48 but nothing matched			0
found : @entity1 thought that this photo of her with her daughter @entity52 when she was born was lost ‘ it got on my nerves so i carried on looking through and saw the little boy in the photos had a school jumper on			1
’ at that point mr @entity57 , who lives in @entity58 , @entity59 with his wife and two children , rang the @entity63 school on the jumper and told the receptionist about his search			2
‘ she told me to send her a picture of the child and to find out who it is			2
then she said “ out of interest , what is the mother ’s name ? ” i told her and she said “ @entity77 that ’s my next door neighbour ”			0
‘ next thing i knew i got a call from @entity47 who was over the moon and i sent her the pictures in the post			0
’ @entity14 , who found the memory card , said : ‘ i was just digging and kicking the sand around			1
i did n’t know what it was and it was time to go so i showed my dad and he told me what it was			0
’ the seven - year - old , who is at primary school , and loves football and cricket , said he was on his @entity98 holidays and had his bucket and spade with him			0
precious : another photo that was saved , of @entity1 's daughter amber with her late great grandmother @entity102 he had never found anything unusual before in the sand , ‘ it was just pure luck ’ , his father said			1
miss @entity107 said : ‘ the memory card must have blown away in the wind because it was so windy and i was really gutted			1
i have a really bad memory so photos are everything to me			1
’ the photos – taken up until may last year – included pictures of her pregnant , photos of her baby amber after being born , and photos of her daughter ’s first @entity118			2
there were also videos of her son @entity122 , 6 , and @entity52 , now 21 months , visiting @entity118 and videos of @entity52 making her first cooing noises			0
one of the most treasured memories was a video of @entity52 with miss @entity107 ’s grandmother @entity102 who hit the headlines when she ended her own life in a @entity132 clinic in @entity133			0
miss @entity107 said : ‘ it was a very special video of my nan as she died in september last year			0
she is filmed holding @entity52 in her flat and having a conversation			0
’ she said she received a call from the receptionist at @entity122 ’s school on a monday a few weeks ago when he was off sick			0
she added : ‘ i was a bit freaked out and thought that is so weird but i called him straight away			0
‘ when i received the pictures it made me feel so happy and relieved ’ .			0
