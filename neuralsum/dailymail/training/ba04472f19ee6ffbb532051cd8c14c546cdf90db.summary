by @entity0 two dolphins who died a slow , agonising death at a zoo after it hosted a rave were probably killed by a party - goer 's heroin substitute , according to a leaked toxicology report			1
the dolphins , called @entity10 and @entity11 , died within five days of each other at a zoo in @entity14 last november			1
bosses at the park had rented land near the dolphins ' training pool to organisers of a weekend rave party for thousands of clubbers			1
slow and painful death : a toxicology report concluded that @entity10 was probably killed by a party - goer 's heroin substitute before the party : @entity10 had been one of the star attractions at the @entity29 zoo in @entity14 prosecutors said at the time that they were considering negligence charges because they believed antibiotics given by zoo vets were to blame for the deaths at @entity29 in @entity35			1
but another toxicology report carried out at the time , leaked to @entity14 media , has raised new questions about what happened			1
tests conducted by the forensics institute in @entity43 found the heroin substitute @entity45 in the animals ' urine			2
@entity49 marine biologist and dolphin expert @entity48 said : ' opiates are extremely dangerous for underwater mammals and would never be used in any legitimate treatment			0
' the reason is that dolphins are conscious breathers which means they actively decide when to come to the surface to breathe , for which they need to be awake			2
' even when sleeping , there is part of the brain that automatically controls the breathing instinct in the same way as it does for people when asleep			0
' drugging them with opiates could well cause this part of the brain to switch off with fatal consequences			0
' putting on a show : bosses at the park had rented land near the dolphins ' training pool to organisers of a weekend rave party for thousands of clubbers it was originally suggested by keepers that rave - goers could have caused the death by feeding the dolphins illegal recreational drugs but prosecutors had rejected this , blaming the zoo 's vets			1
@entity29 spokesman @entity88 said it would ask questions about why the initial theory had not been followed up and why the zoo 's vets had been blamed			1
@entity10 and @entity93 died after what staff described as a ' drawn out and painful ' death			1
@entity29 keeper @entity96 told local media : ' the death went on for over an hour			2
i have not been able to sleep since			0
' when we went to start the dolphin training we noticed the same thing that had happened to @entity10 was happening with @entity93			1
investigation : prosecutors initially considered negligence charges because they believed antibiotics given by the zoo 's vets were to blame for the deaths ' he was drifting under the water and was clearly in trouble and so we jumped into the water			0
' we tried to hold him			0
he was shaking all over and was foaming at the mouth			0
' eventually we got him out of the water			0
his tongue was hanging out			0
' he was given adrenalin , but it did n't help			0
' after an hour the dolphin died			2
' questions : bosses at @entity29 want to know why the zoo 's vets were blamed for the deaths of @entity10 and @entity11 furious animal activists say they warned both the marine park and local planners - who gave permission for the rave - of the dangers before the event			1
they had been concerned that the high levels of noise could damage the marine mammals ' immune system , sensitive sonar and hearing			0
@entity29 has consistently denied any wrongdoing .			2

@entity10 and @entity11 died within five days of each other at @entity29 in @entity14
