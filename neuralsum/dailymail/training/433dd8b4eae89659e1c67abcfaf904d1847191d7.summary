tuesday night ’s @entity1 third - round replay between @entity2 and @entity3 had everything the competition could possibly want			1
there were goals , controversy and end - to - end drama before the unlikely hero — @entity2 goalkeeper @entity11 — discarded his gloves and calmly side - footed home the decisive penalty in the shootout			0
it was a riveting , old - fashioned cup tie			0
unfortunately it came too late for the @entity1 ’s beleaguered commercial department			2
the @entity1 concede they face a losing battle in their botched search this season for someone to sponsor their flagship tournament			1
@entity11 is mobbed after scoring @entity2 ’s winner in one of the most memorable games of the season @entity11 fired home the winning spot kick after hurling his gloves to floor during his run - up @entity33 @entity34 : £ 40m per year @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 @entity38 : £ 6m @entity39 @entity40 : £ 5.5m @entity41 @entity42 : unavailable @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 @entity46 : £ 700,000 @entity47 and @entity48 and @entity49 @entity50 : unavailable @entity51 , @entity44 , @entity45 @entity52 : unavailable when the top nine tiers of @entity56 football — and indeed any sports competition worth its salt — draw in millions of pounds in sponsorship , it seems ludicrous that the @entity1 lacks a backer			1
it is even more extraordinary that the @entity1 have failed to find a partner when the new tv rights contract this season has seen the return of the @entity66 , who have given the tournament huge exposure over many platforms , with viewing figures up			1
it is not as if the @entity1 did not have time to find a sponsor			1
it was known well over a year ago that @entity76 were ending their £ 9million - a - year deal			0
the @entity1 were so confident of attracting a new backer at the same price — or higher — that they were briefing before the @entity80 about a set of global partners to go with the main sponsor			1
even last october , general secretary @entity84 was adamant that a sponsor would ‘ definitely ’ be in position before the third round			0
but this has not happened and the fact that @entity84 is leaving at the end of the month does not help the sponsorship search			2
the @entity1 say their hunt has been made more difficult by the price being beyond many @entity95 - only budgets — they were looking for £ 10m - a - year - plus at the start — and attracting global corporations is tough			2
one company , understood to be another beer brand , was close to signing but the deal fell away			0
the @entity1 have only themselves to blame for asking too high a price for a tournament that is in danger of losing its way in this @entity33 - dominated era			1
even @entity106 , a team with no relegation worries and for whom the @entity1 offers a rare chance of silverware , still fielded a weakened team			0
holders @entity112 continue the defence of their crown with a trip to @entity116 at the end of the month @entity106 were one of several teams to field an under - strength side as the @entity120 crashed out to @entity121 the @entity1 also chose to revamp their commercial department ahead of the @entity1 hunt , parting company with experienced executives in @entity126 and @entity127 and bringing in @entity128 , @entity130 ’s global sales manager , to add some of @entity132 ’s successful strategies			2
but @entity130 ’s ‘ scalpel ’ tactics of splitting up sponsorships around the globe , as well as dressing up personalised branding for any potential backer , is plainly yet to work at @entity139			0
the @entity1 board have been remarkably relaxed about the failure of commercial director @entity142 and his team to secure a @entity1 sponsorship but now they may have to contemplate the unthinkable and consider offering full @entity1 naming rights rather than the ‘ in association with ’ partnership to kick - start the search			1
if so , it would herald an ignominious chapter for football ’s oldest competition .			0
