its residents have long been known as the mythical letter - writer disgusted of @entity3			1
so the genteel @entity5 spa town should prepare to be outraged - because foul - mouthed beer - spitting heroin addict punk @entity6 could soon be given a memorial plaque			1
the spiky - haired @entity9 singer , real name @entity12 , attended the town 's @entity13 for three years before leaving for @entity15 aged 14 in 1971			1
disgusted ? @entity9 singer @entity6 ( left ) could soon be given a memorial plaque on his former home in @entity3 ( right ) , where he lived with his mother @entity18 while attending the town 's @entity13 icon : @entity6 made an angry stand against the @entity22 and died of a heroin overdose in 1979 he moved to a rented flat with his mother @entity18 and spent around six years in the area long before he was famous			1
his school still exists , renamed as @entity27			0
now his name has been put forward among those of 32 other famous former residents who could receive a plaque on their former homes			0
volunteers won funds from @entity3 for 20 of the plaques , which cost around £ 300 each			1
they defended their choice of the punk star - but said he will face stiff competition from war heroes and historians to make the final cut			2
@entity43 , chairman of the @entity44 , told @entity45 : ' we 're all prepared to argue the case if necessary			1
@entity48 : @entity49 is the only spa town in the south east of @entity50 and has gained a reputation for ' disgusted ' conservative letter - writers - even if most residents say the stereotype is unfair punk star : @entity6 kicks a @entity15 black taxi in 1977			1
he lived in @entity3 before moving aged 14 ' we would be prepared to defend the inclusion of any of the names on our list			2
' it 's only a longlist , though , and i think @entity6 is probably an outlier			2
it 's not for me to make the final decision			2
' @entity6 died from a heroin overdose aged 21 in 1979 after being arrested over his lover @entity68 ’s murder in @entity70			0
his fame came from his anti-establishment behaviour and he routinely spat beer at fans , sneered at rivals , beat people up , swore non-stop and user razors to cut swear words into his body			2
but he was also widely credited with changing the face of @entity82 music forever , opening the doors to the jarring electronic creativity of the 1980s , and galvanising one of the @entity87 's biggest shifts in pop culture			0
the plaques will be dark red and round , and follow 15 which were put up in 2006 on the town 's 400th anniversary			1
the only criteria for the people to be featured was they had to have a genuine link with the town and have been dead for some time			1
among the local heroes being considered are soldier @entity99 , who died two days after the start of the @entity101 after his ship was hit by a mine			0
history : other names on the longlist include soldier @entity99 , who died two days into the @entity101 troubled couple : the mystery remains over whether @entity6 ( right ) killed his girlfriend @entity68 ( left ) other plaques under consideration are airwoman @entity112 , who headed the female branch of the @entity114 during the @entity115 , and historian @entity116			0
some residents of the town were angry			0
one , @entity119 , 49 , said : ' nobody wants to be reminded that @entity6 lived here - he was a vile man who died as he lived , surrounded by filth and misery			0
' he hardly has anything good to be said about him and it would be best is his name was scattered to the four winds			0
' another , @entity128 , said the people of @entity3 were ‘ not interested ’ in the @entity9 , adding : ' the @entity9 were a passing fad that had nothing to do with @entity3			0
' they might have made it big in @entity15 , but nobody here cares about , or wants to be reminded , about them			0
' the civic society plans to meet in less than two weeks to make their final decision - but their final choices will also have to be signed off by the local council .			1
