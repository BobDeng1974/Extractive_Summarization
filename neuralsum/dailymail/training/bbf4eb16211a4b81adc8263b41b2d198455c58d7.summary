to mark the @entity146 , @entity14 in @entity15 has been awarded city status ' i am delighted that after almost 25 years of trying , the town of @entity14 has been honoured by @entity114			1

' i would like to congratulate the three towns that have today gained city status , ' he said			1

' even though city status was summarily removed when local government was reorganised , @entity12 has continued to be known as the " @entity214 "			1
full restoration of its ancient dignity is long overdue			0
' this decision reflects the fact that @entity12 is at the forefront of @entity13 life : a modern , dynamic , international city , offering unrivalled business , artistic , educational , cultural and sporting opportunities to its citizens and visitors			1
' it is located at the hub of @entity13 's transport network , at the gateway to the @entity230 , and in the midst of remarkable scenery			2
' @entity12 has many royal connections , and is the home of the @entity235 , the @entity236 's most famous infantry battalion			2
' it is the home of home - grown multi-national firms such as @entity241 and @entity242 , and is an important centre for @entity244 and @entity245			0

councillor @entity262 , leader of the @entity263 on @entity12 & @entity264 , said city status would have ' significant and lasting benefits ' for the economy across @entity12 and @entity264 , particularly through membership of the @entity270 's now ' @entity269 ' , which grants access to seed - corn funding for inter-city region project development			1
cllr @entity274 , leader of the @entity275 , added : ' many people believe that @entity12 is already a city but back in 1975 @entity12 was stripped of the right to be called a city			1
