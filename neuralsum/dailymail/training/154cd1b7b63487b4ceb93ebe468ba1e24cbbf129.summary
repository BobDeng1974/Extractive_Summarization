there was an undeniable connection between two - year - old @entity2 and his idol @entity3 when they first met on monday			1
@entity2 , who has @entity6 syndrome , had the opportunity of a lifetime to spend three days with his hero - a one of the world 's most recognised individual who suffers from the same genetic disorder			1
mother @entity13 , who contacted mr @entity3 and asked him to spend time with her son during his nation - wide tour to educate schools about @entity6 syndrome , says the 30 - year - old of @entity20 has left a huge impact on her family			1
the rare genetic disorder - which affects one child in every 50,000 - prevents the skull , cheek and jawbones from developing properly			1
' not only is a huge celebrity and a hero to us but to have the same condition as our son and to have such a positive attitude is very inspiring			1
@entity6 syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of the head			1
it prevents the skull , cheek and jawbones from developing properly , causing facial defects and hearing loss			0
about one child in every 50,000 is affected			0
problems range in severity from mild to very severe			0
in most cases , the child 's intelligence is normal			0
' his visit and how completely fine is after everything he has been through has given us hope for @entity2			1
' he is an important role model to anyone anywhere upset about how they look and his speeches have helped change people 's attitudes to love themselves for who they are			0
' mr @entity3 arrived on monday to meet the @entity2 family and stayed in @entity76 , in @entity37 , about an hour and a half from @entity32			1
' one of my biggest fears as a mother is that @entity2 wo n't be accepted at school , ' mrs @entity13 said			1
' but knowing that @entity3 is doing a tour to educate schools about @entity6 syndrome , it makes me feel relieved			1
' it gives me hope that my son can grow up to be a happy man			0
' two - year - old @entity2 has a tracheostomy , which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment @entity2 is feed with a tube and his mother @entity94 has to monitor him 24 hours a day mrs @entity13 says she witnessed the strong bond between the her son and mr @entity3 on monday afternoon			1
' @entity33 is quite shy and does n't warm up to anyone easily but for some reason , i do n't know what it was , he connected with @entity3 , ' she said			1
' maybe it 's because @entity3 is such a friendly and caring person who is n't judgemental			2
' just recently , mrs @entity13 pleaded with the @entity103 after they announced they were going to take away the highly - trained nurse who helps look after her son @entity2 one day a week			1
the mother of five whose two - year - old son could die at any moment without round the clock care has told how she ' cried with happiness ' after her campaign to stop her son 's help being cut was successful			2
@entity2 also has a tracheostomy , which means his airway is compromised and could be obstructed at any moment			1
@entity33 's siblings ( from left ) patience , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123			2
@entity33 is held by his father @entity124 who 's next to his wife			2
mr @entity3 is pictured next to his girlfriend @entity35 ' we have to monitor him around the clock			1
it 's already highly stressful and exhausting , and the one day of respite care allowed us to get by , ' mrs @entity13 wrote on a change.org petition that has been signed by over 37,000 people			2
the 27 - year - old found out in october that the @entity134 will reinstate @entity2 's nurse after public outcry about the decision to cut his help			2
the family live in @entity76 and living rurally means their local hospital is n't trained to deal with emergencies for people with a tracheostomy			2
mrs @entity13 , who also looks after her four other children at home while her husband works long hours to make ends meet , said the response has been ' overwhelming '			1
' i cried i was so happy			0
it just means so much			0
it means i will be able to manage , to look forward to things and plan things again , ' mrs @entity13 told @entity42			1
' i can do all the things everyone takes for granted again - one day a week - now without worrying about equipment or life or death			0
' i can get in the car and just breathe			0
' on mrs @entity13 's moving change.org petition she wrote : ' it 's a scary weight to carry around , knowing that it 's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive ' mother @entity13 pleaded with the @entity103 after they announced they were going to take away the carer who helps look after her son @entity167 one day a week mrs @entity13 is looking forward to being able to continue to take her other children - @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 - to the movies and the beach one day a week in the school holidays			1
' @entity2 ca n't go anywhere like that so the other kids miss out , ' she said			2
' and i can get my hair done and go food shopping , pay the bills , get in and out of the car , have coffee and have time to organise birthday presents - just the little things			0
' the mother described how @entity2 ' absolutely adores ' the nurse who looks after him one day a week and is ' very particular with people '			2
over the next few years things are only going to get harder for the @entity191 as @entity2 begins major re-constructive surgery			2
the relief mrs @entity13 feels knowing that a nurse will be there to help - at least for the foreseeable future - is palpable			2
having a nurse for @entity2 means mrs @entity13 can take her four other children , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 , to the cinema and the beach in the school holidays @entity2 ' absolutely adores ' the nurse who looks after him one day a week , mrs @entity13 said ' if anything it will get worse , not him but the issues he faces			1
for example he does n't get head colds , it goes straight through his lungs … he will be starting kinder soon and the more he goes out the more he gets sick , ' she said describing the challenges ahead			0
' he will also have some big surgery			0
from next year he will have a jaw … they will break it at the back and slowly turn it millimetres per day to bring it forward			0
he will also have his checks rebuilt and the surgery will go into adulthood			0
' there is no guarantee that he 'll ever not need a feeding tube			0
' on mrs @entity13 's moving change.org petition she wrote : ' it 's a scary weight to carry around , knowing that it 's up to me to know what to do and keep my son alive			1
it 's a weight parents of children with tracheostomies should n't have to bear just because they live in a rural area			2
' that 's not right			0
we ca n't easily just move			0
we own our home , we 'd need to uproot our other children , we have family here , we have hopes and dreams and aspirations for our future in this town			0
we just want to safely be able to include our son in that future			0
' the family are still calling for more training about tracheostomy patients for doctors and nurses in rural hospitals			0
' this is my son 's life at stake			0
it 's also the lives of many other children with tracheostomy who are being ignored and neglected			1
right now it seems like only a matter of time before the unthinkable happens , and someone like my son dies because of the lack of training and help the government is giving to rural tracheostomy patients , ' she wrote			1
the family are still calling for more training about tracheostomy patients for doctors and nurses in rural hospitals			0
