a girlfriend made her partner of six years wear a t - shirt covered in pictures of the two of them together			1
@entity6 , 20 , had the shirt custom - made for her boyfriend @entity8 , 24			1
it bears the uncompromising message : ' i love my girlfriend @entity12 , i hate the girls in @entity14 , so please stay away from me '			2
pictures of mr @entity8 wearing the t - shirt were then posted online and received large amounts of attention - leading miss @entity6 to worry it could have the opposite effect and attract girls who ' like a challenge '			1
but the couple , who have a five - year - old daughter and live together in @entity32 , have laughed off the publicity and are treating the incident as a joke			1
miss @entity6 said : ' when i took it in to the printing shop and explained what i wanted i swear they must have thought i was a psycho			2
at home with the family : mr @entity8 is pictured above with his girlfriend , 20 - year - old @entity6 , and their daughter @entity44 , five together : miss @entity6 spoke of her fears that the t - shirt 's fame online may attract women to her boyfriend ' @entity8 was n't expecting it , i had mentioned that i would make him a t - shirt but did n't think i actually would			1
' he saw the funny side of it because it is really just a joke , he and i have a really similar sense of humour			0
' he ended up laughing about it and even posed for pictures wearing it			0
' @entity12 , a criminology student at @entity61 , said : ' @entity8 said he definitely will wear it in @entity14 now because he 's practically famous , but i think it might have the opposite effect			1
' now that everyone has seen it online i think it might just attract loads of girls ... some girls like a challenge			0
' ' i have absolutely no reason to be jealous or possessive because i know @entity8 would never cheat on me			2
' we met when we were really young and have been together ever since			0
i trust him completely and we 've been on separate holidays before , that 's just how our relationship works , we do our own thing			0
' ' trust him completely ' : miss @entity6 has said both she and her boyfriend consider the shirt a joke ' just how our relationship is ' : mr @entity83 said the two of them always take separate holidays mr @entity83 , who is in a band called @entity87 and works in a warehouse , left @entity32 on three days ago for a festival in @entity90 and flies out to @entity14 this friday			1
he said : ' at first i thought is she serious ? she wanted me to wear it to all the big clubs like @entity96 etc. ' but now i get that it 's a joke i 'm happy enough to go along with it , that 's just how our relationship is it 's just silly			0
' people have been saying that wearing the t - shirt might attract girls , some girls will definitely take it as some sort off challenge			0
' i just have to laugh about it , @entity12 is the only girl for me an we both know that ! '			0
