their 30 - year - old parents , @entity20 and @entity21 , admit that though life with twins can be extremely challenging , it 's moments like this that also make it very fun and rewarding			2
the environment at home is all hands on deck and mum and dad are equally as involved in every aspect of the twins ' day			2
' it 's a two people job , ' the couple said in an email			0

@entity42 , @entity20 , captured the heartwarming moment when the two realised they had a little playmate for life although life with twins can be difficult , their parents admit that moments like these make it all worth it ' they copy each other , but they have very different personalities , though both love to laugh and have a great sense of humour			1
