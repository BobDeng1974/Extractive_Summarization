hoverboards have become an obsession for amateur designers ever since @entity3 jumped on one in @entity4 now , one @entity6 claims he has finally been able to create his own version for just £ 160 using garden leaf blowers that float on a pocket of air			1
@entity11 , 27 , built the device using four leaf blowers , a 4ft by 4ft ( 1.2 by 1.2 metre ) piece of plywood , a skateboard deck , shower liner , coffee can lids and gaffer tape			1
the waiter said he came up with the idea after seeing another hoverboard project on @entity35 , which inspired him to design one which anyone can build			2
' i 'm a huge @entity4 fan and always wanted to build one , ' he said			1
' i saw the @entity43 campaign with @entity44 and thought it was the perfect time to try building one			0
' back to the future : @entity11 , 27 , built the device using four leaf blowers , a 4ft by 4ft ( 1.2 by 1.2 metre ) piece of plywood , a skateboard deck , shower liner , coffee can lids and gaffer tape floating on air : ' i 'm a huge @entity4 fan and always wanted to build one , ' said mr @entity11 ( pictured ) ' i saw the @entity43 campaign with @entity44 and thought it was the perfect time to try building one ' ' it can move quite a bit once it 's going , and despite the steering issue , which really is n't quite there , you can go quite far and move a little bit			1
mr @entity11 explained that the device is essentially a miniature version of a hovercraft			1
he has also released instructions for anyone who would like to make their own			0
a skirt fills with air that is released below from strategically placed holes that create a small pocket between the device , dubbed ' mr @entity78 ' , and the ground			1
the @entity82 hoverboard uses four ' hover engines ' which emit magnetic fields that push against each other in october , @entity88 architect @entity87 made a similar hoverboard that floats in mid-air			0
dubbed the @entity78 , the technology uses four ' hover engines ' which emit magnetic fields that push against each other as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath			2
the idea came to mr @entity87 while he was trying to find ways of building structures that can better withstand earthquakes			0
as part of his research , he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster			0
that same technology , he realised , could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air			0
in a video released by mr @entity87 , a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom - built skate ramp on his board , which is held an inch of the ground			0
unlike the @entity4 board , the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum - to serve as a secondary magnetic field			2
' the @entity4 hoverboard has always been the impossible dream , but i wanted to make a real hoverboard that was accessible and workable and fun to use , and not too expensive , ' added mr @entity11			1
' there are so many variations of skateboard and this one could easily end up being just another variation			0
' but i would love for people to take my idea and develop it to the point where it becomes universal			0
' the design becomes even more staggering as mr @entity11 is not a designer or inventor – and he says his first prototypes were far from perfect			1
blown away : ' @entity144 hoverboard ( right ) has always been the impossible dream , but i wanted to make a real hoverboard that was accessible and workable and fun to use , and not too expensive , ' added mr @entity11			1
@entity148 is an early prototype created using a hairdryer ' i 'm not an engineer , ' he said			0
' i work in a restaurant , so it 's pretty naive of me to buy four leaf blowers			2
' i 'm pretty much broke all the time usually and if people want to donate then that would be wonderful			0
mr @entity11 has been working on the design since march and the early prototypes had wheels and were much smaller at first			1
' one was even powered by a disassembled hairdryer , until i finally hit on the idea of the leaf blowers , ' he said			2
' the process is very chaotic and it 's so much easier to fail than to succeed			0
' mr @entity11 is now working on the next version which he hopes will be quieter , with improved air flow and less vibration			1

' mr @entity78 ' was created by @entity11 , 27 , from @entity179 , @entity6
he used leaf blowers , plywood , a skateboard , shower liner and coffee lids
he claims anyone can build their own using simple tools found at home
mr @entity11 says he is a huge @entity4 fan , and was inspired by the film , but admits his invention needs refining
