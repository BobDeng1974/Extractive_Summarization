by @entity1 reporter published : 12:37 est , 27 february 2014 @entity3 : 14:07 est , 27 february 2014 as @entity6 prepares to pull all @entity8 troops from @entity9 by 2015 , @entity5 ’s secretary - general has warned against a full withdrawal			1
president @entity6 has made clear his desire to draw down troops from the war - torn nation by year 's end , and the @entity8 and @entity5 may not be left with a choice as @entity9 leader @entity17 still refuses to sign a security agreement			1
@entity5 ’s secretary - general @entity19 has said that a full withdrawal of @entity5 troops is not desirable and that it would be detrimental to the people of @entity9			1
‘ today we agreed the need to plan for all possible outcomes including the possibility that we may not be able to deploy to @entity9 after 2014 due to the persistent delays we have seen , ’ the @entity5 secretary - general told a news conference			1
on wednesday , @entity19 said he still hoped plans to keep troops in @entity9 beyond this year could be salvaged			1
‘ let me be clear that this is not the outcome we want , ’ @entity19 said , referring to the option of no @entity5 troops staying behind in @entity9 after this year			1
‘ it is not the outcome we think is in the interest of the @entity9 people			2
however , it might be the unfortunate outcome if there is no security agreement in due time			0
this is what is at stake			0
’ @entity8 secretary of defense @entity61 , right , talks with @entity19 prior to the start of a meeting of @entity5 defense ministers at @entity5 headquarters in @entity67 today @entity69 insurgents continue to rain destruction on @entity9 's cities and villages , continuing the @entity74 's quest to deploy just the right amount of muscle in response sad sack ? @entity78 chief @entity61 had to tell reporters on monday that @entity8 military strength would be pared back to ts levels in 1940 without going as far as the zero option , @entity5 could also look at scaling back its current plan , which calls for a training mission headquartered in @entity88 and four regional bases , and focus instead on the capital , diplomats say in the @entity8 tuesday marked the first time a scenario has been discussed publicly that would completely void @entity9 of @entity8 personnel who have been vital in fighting @entity69 militias			1
' president @entity6 has asked the @entity78 to ensure that it has adequate plans in place to accomplish an orderly withdrawal by the end of the year should the @entity8 not keep any troops in @entity9 after 2014 , ' the @entity96 said tuesday morning			1
that message was part of a phone call between @entity6 and @entity9 leader @entity17 on tuesday , during which the @entity8 president reportedly pressured him to accept the terms of a @entity108 ( @entity109 ) that has been pending for months			1
the @entity6 administration has made the agreement , drafted in november , a requirement if it is to leave a counter-terrorism force in @entity17 's country after the larger @entity8 pullout is complete			2
@entity17 has been putting off the decision to sign the @entity109 , saying that it should be left for his successor			0
@entity9 president @entity17 wants to pass the decision about an @entity8 security agreement to his successor , but that may leave a @entity8 - dependent @entity5 with too little time to plan its 2015 deployments elections will be held in april to choose the next president			1
but that process could drag on for months since @entity9 's presidential election process is a two - stage system that may not be complete until july or august			2
a @entity78 source told @entity129 that existing @entity78 plans call for as many as 10,000 troops to remain behind , split between training forces and special operators equipped to raid @entity69 strongholds			0
but those plans are fluid			0
and since so many @entity5 allies in @entity9 depend on @entity8 troops for logistical support and just - in - time war materiel , those world powers are finding it hard to plan without a clear nod from the @entity8			1
and @entity6 's decision is already limiting the choices of a @entity5 panel of defense ministers meeting this week in @entity67 , @entity147			2
the @entity5 group is weighing how many troops to place in @entity9 next year , and the political tug - of - war between @entity151 and @entity88 promises to wreak havoc with those plans			1
if @entity17 's successor is n't in place until the end of the summer , the @entity78 source cautioned , @entity5 will find itself in a time crunch with just months or weeks left to finalize deployment decisions			0
@entity8 troops are a common sight -- for now -- in @entity88 , where at least one person was killed and four others were wounded during a bombing most of the major - party contenders for the @entity9 presidency have spoken in favor of the @entity8 agreement , but @entity5 generals and the @entity78 do n't want to premise billions of dollars in logistical moves on the uncertain outcome of a @entity174 election			1
' we will leave open the possibility of concluding a @entity109 with @entity9 later this year , ' the @entity96 said tuesday			0
ouch : former vice president @entity177 said tuesday that president @entity6 would rather spend federal dollars on food stamps than on a strong military ' however , the longer we go without a @entity109 , the more challenging it will be to plan and execute any @entity8 mission			0
furthermore , the longer we go without a @entity109 , the more likely it will be that any post- 2014 @entity8 mission will be smaller in scale and ambition			0
' @entity17 has been cantankerous and his commitments have become more elusive as the @entity8 has withdrawn platoon after platoon			0
but the @entity78 knows that he ca n't run for the top post again			0
his war of words with @entity6 may be a case of one lame duck speaking to another – the worst circumstance for @entity6 's latest move if it 's just an @entity197 bluff			0
the @entity78 , however , insists that the president may actually order a complete withdrawal after the @entity5 meeting in @entity147 , where secretary of state @entity61 will represent @entity8 interests			2
' without question , the issues surrounding the future of the @entity9 mission will certainly be discussed in @entity67 , to include the challenges of retrograde and force posture faced by all allies , ' @entity78 press secretary @entity203 told @entity211			2
' we long said that we would like a @entity109 as soon as possible			0
absent that , ' he vowed , ' we would have to start planning to withdraw all our forces by the end of the year			0

@entity6 has made it clear that he wishes to pull troops by 2015
