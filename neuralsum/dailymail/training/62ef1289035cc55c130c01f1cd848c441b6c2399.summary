by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 16:31 est , 30 august 2013 mamma mia ! what is this ? @entity4 may currently be @entity6 ’s favourite @entity5 chef – a man who appears to be on tv almost every day – but it turns out his own family do n’t think he ’s up to much in the kitchen			1
this revelation becomes apparent when he returns to his @entity13 home as part of his first primetime tv show , @entity16 , and he ’s shaking like a leaf as he makes salmon pasta and cherry tiramisu for his mother and close relatives			1
' i can cook in front of millions of people on tv , i do n’t care , ' says @entity4			1
' but cooking for my own family really freaked me out			2
if they do n’t like it , they tell you			2
they ’re a bit too honest , they should lie a bit more			2
back to his roots : @entity4 has returned to his native @entity5 for a new tv show out next month ' my mum ca n’t believe i ’m a tv chef in @entity39			1
she says , " i ’m amazed , how did this happen when you ’re so messy and not as good as me ? " i say , " if you ’re such a great cook , why do n’t you have a cookery show ? " she does n’t like that			2
she thinks i ’m a bit too cocky ... ' @entity4 ’s @entity5 escape finds @entity4 , 37 , taking a mouthwatering journey around southern @entity5 where he grew up , revealing the delicious secrets of the area ’s traditional dishes and sourcing the ingredients that make them so special			1
he goes cherry - picking in @entity54 and gets to touch sacred 3,000 - year - old olive trees in @entity56			2
' they have microchips in them so that if anyone touches them it sends a satellite signal and the police will be there in ten minutes			2
' there ’s even deep - fried pizza in @entity13			2
' at school we used to eat it and i ’d forgotten the taste , ' he recalls			2
' it does n’t taste deep - fried , it ’s absolutely beautiful			2
' and it ’s not just the food that takes centre stage in the show – @entity5 ’s breathtaking scenery is one of the highlights			1
in one episode in the beautiful @entity85 town of @entity86 he gets to cook on the roof of one of its unique cone - shaped trulli houses			2
@entity90 ! @entity4 ( pictured with his mother - left - as a baby ) says his family are n't impressed with his cooking skills tucking in : @entity4 gets to grips with some @entity5 classics - and finds some new favourites ' that was a pretty special moment , ' he says of the @entity99 , one of the country ’s most striking tourist attractions			1
in @entity103 he even cooks outside the magnificent @entity104 after sourcing his ingredients at the central market			2
from there he heads to the @entity108 , and stops off at the resorts where he holidayed as a child to cook and meet the locals			2
' my mum and dad used to take my sister and me there on camping and fishing holidays so it was great to revisit and tell the story of the area through food , ' he recalls			0
and there were a few surprises in store , even for @entity4			0
' i never realised @entity127 lemons had no pips and were so sweet they could be eaten like apples			0
the skin is beautiful and spongy , not acidic like the ones that you get in @entity6			0
' he believes the trip has only made him more passionate about what the @entity5 have , and what we in @entity6 lack			1
' what ’s special about @entity5 is the weather , and the fact that they have respect for their ingredients , ' he says			1
' in @entity6 you ca n’t grow beautiful tomatoes or courgettes and there is not so much respect for ingredients			0
we allow supermarkets to sell rubbish			0
we should all be saying , " you know what ? we ’re not going to buy strawberries at @entity159 because we do n’t need to			0
" a key rule for every cook should be not to buy food when it ’s out of season because it ’s expensive and tastes awful			0
' 2,400 ... years ago pasta was first made and eaten in what ’s now the north - west of @entity5 600 ... the number of pasta shapes in existence , from penguins to mobile phones 51 ... the weight in pounds of pasta eaten every year by the average @entity5 he thinks we have a misplaced idea about what good @entity5 food is , and he hopes that by showing an @entity5 enjoying the best @entity5 has to offer he ’ll give us a fresh understanding about this land of foodies			1
' very few @entity5 restaurants in @entity6 do a good job , ' he says			1
' they ’re too scared to show you what real @entity5 food is like because they think you ca n’t handle it , so they dilute it			1
a lot of the sauces in @entity5 restaurants here do n’t make sense			1
they ’re non-existent in @entity5			1
' the sauce he makes for the salmon to serve his mother is a fiery arrabiata			0
' this dish has been completely forgotten because people believed chilli was too overpowering for salmon , but it is n’t			0
similarly , real carbonara sauce does n’t have cream and mushrooms like it does here			0
' all of this led @entity4 to open a pasta and sandwich bar in the @entity211 recently ; his plan is to have 20 across the country in the next few years			0
' i was there a year and a half ago and i realised how much rubbish they sell			0
so i decided to open a proper pasta bar – good carbs , real @entity5 ingredients			1
we ’re already cooking for 500 at lunchtime			0
' @entity4 ’s love of food is in his genes			0
his grandfather was head chef at a restaurant in @entity13 and @entity4 used to leave school early to watch him at work			1
' i wanted to be just like him , ' he recalls			0
@entity4 started his own chef training when he was 13 , but despite being fascinated with @entity6 as a boy he never imagined he ’d end up here			1
he met half - @entity6 half - @entity5 @entity236 when he went to work in @entity239 ’s @entity238 restaurant in @entity240 when he was 18			1
regular on the box : gino with his tv show co-host @entity243 she was his first love and , after a brief split , he decided she was his only love and he followed her to @entity6			1
' i never tried to convince my wife to move to @entity5 , ' he says			1
' she would n’t have liked that			0
' he started working for a ready - meals company which led to his first tv break , as a guest on @entity255 on @entity256			1
with his good looks , @entity5 charm and fabulous accent he was soon on every foodie show going , before ending up with a slot on this morning			1
but it was his winning appearance on i ’m a celebrity ... @entity265 ! in 2009 that made him our favourite adopted @entity5			1
home is a £ 1 million pad in @entity271 in @entity272 , where he lives with @entity236 and their two sons @entity276 , 11 , and @entity277 , eight			0
his wife may do most of the cooking but he very much rules the roost the @entity5 way			1
' whenever we can we always eat together and everybody sits at the table , ' he says			0
' everybody starts to eat when i sit down			0
nobody gets up from the table until i do			0
i like to have the respect			0
' maybe you should tell that to your mother , @entity4 ! @entity16 , 13 september , 8pm , @entity294			0
the accompanying book ( @entity296 , £ 20 ) is out on 14 september .			0
