a firm which declared that the @entity1 harboured as much oil as the @entity3 has been forced to backtrack on its ‘ wild claims ’			0
last week , @entity5 ( @entity6 ) boasted it had discovered a ‘ world class potential resource ’ beneath the @entity9			1
the oil exploration company claimed analysis of a well near @entity13 suggested 100 billion barrels of oil lay beneath the @entity16 , covering @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity21 @entity5 has backtracked on its claims the @entity21 could be sitting on an oil reserve larger than what has been extracted from the @entity3 and @entity25			1
above , the company 's test oil well at @entity28 sceptics immediately queried the bold claims – as the @entity31 reported – but @entity6 ’s millionaire chairman @entity32 insisted at the time that the oil would create thousands of jobs , saying : ‘ if you own a farm or land in the @entity39 , there ’s a pretty good chance there ’s a bucket - load of oil under there			2
’ now the firm has been forced into an embarrassing u-turn , admitting that it can not be sure how much crude lies beneath the region – if , indeed , there is much at all			0
@entity6 and a consortium of other oil firms hold a licence for just 55 square miles in @entity17 and @entity18 , a tiny fraction of the @entity16			1
but after finding oil in the area , it scaled up its findings across the whole 1,100 - square mile @entity39 area			1
the company has now admitted that its estimates were based on findings made in a 55 - square - mile stretch of the basin , less than two per cent of the total surface area a map showing the location of the oil and gas deposits within the @entity16 , which are thought to lie at between 2,500ft and 3,000ft below the ground it claimed the entire region was rich with the fossil fuel , sparking hopes it had uncovered ‘ @entity21 ’s @entity73 ’			1
yesterday , after being instructed to give more details by the @entity76 , it issued a ‘ clarification ’ , admitting the oil should not yet be considered as ‘ prospective resources or reserves ’			0
it said further drilling and well testing was needed before it could say how much oil existed on its own site – let alone surrounding areas – and what could be recovered from the ground			0
@entity32 has been criticised on the past for exaggerating his companies ' successes to drive up share prices even then , it seems unlikely it could estimate how much lies beneath the whole region , adding : ‘ the company has not undertaken work outside its licence areas sufficient to comment on the possible @entity100 ( oil in place ) in either the approximate 1,100 square miles or the whole of the @entity16			1
’ @entity104 , of @entity105 , said : ‘ @entity6 has backtracked on the wild claims it made last week and admitted that it has no idea how much oil is under the @entity39			2
‘ this is yet another example of the potential for shale oil and gas being overhyped by an industry desperate to start pumping profits with little concern for residents or the climate			0
’ following the announcement of a ‘ significant ’ discovery on april 8 , @entity6 ’s share price soared from about 1p to over 4p the next day			1
but since then , the price has fallen to almost half this , suggesting scepticism in the industry about the claims			0
@entity6 had claimed the supply could meet up to a third of @entity21 ’s oil demand within 15 years			2
it ignited hopes the vast resource would reduce reliance on oil from the @entity133 and @entity134 , and boost @entity21 industry as the @entity3 supply dwindles			2
but the claims were at odds with other research on the @entity16			0
a study by @entity141 suggested a maximum of 40billion barrels in the region , while the @entity145 estimated the basin held just 4.4billion barrels of shale oil			2
professor @entity149 , of @entity141 , said last week that @entity6 ’s claims were ‘ overly - optimistic ’ , while @entity151 , of oil consultancy firm @entity152 , said it would be difficult to drill the green belt area to extract the fossil fuel			0
@entity6 boss mr @entity32 , an @entity155 who lives in @entity157 , is a director of seven @entity21 companies and has been criticised in the past for exaggerating the success of his enterprises to jack up share prices .			0

@entity21 @entity5 described discovery as ' world class ' last week
they claimed the site in @entity18 could yield up to 100 billion barrels of oil
@entity173 's share price *increased* by 200 per cent following ' breakthrough '
but it has today admitted there may not be as much oil there as suggested
they based their estimates on the 55 - square - miles they have licence for
it makes up for less than two per cent of the entire @entity16
