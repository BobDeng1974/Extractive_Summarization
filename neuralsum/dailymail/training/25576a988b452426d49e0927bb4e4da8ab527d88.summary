a phenomenal portrait of an the @entity4 goddess @entity5 marks the beginning of the final chapter in @entity9 's @entity27 the photographic series began as a small summer project but grew into an inspirational creative journey			1
' this escapism grew into the concept of creating an unexplained storybook without words , dedicated to her [ my mother ] , that would echo the fragments of the fairytales she read to me constantly as a child , ' says the artist , who was named the first female @entity42 @entity43 ambassador for @entity44 in july			2
the latest addition is a powerful and emotional vision of the @entity4 personification version of @entity48 , @entity5 , creator and giver of birth to the @entity48 and all the @entity52 ; the heavenly gods , the @entity54 and the @entity55			1
it is called @entity5 , the birth of an end , and is two metres high			1
she wears a grand golden headdress which was handmade by @entity9 , who has a background in fashion and costume design			2
the piece took her over two and - a - half months to finish			2
' i was heavily influenced by @entity66 gods , and my trip to @entity69 in 2012 , during which i had specifically collected traditional bells and tribal necklaces			1
' i began by building up an entire new lower level to the piece , that would help surround the face and balance the enormous proportions of the top section			0
' the headdress was entirely hand painted , dyed and beaded by myself and weighs so much , that it had to be wired to a wooden beam in my studio to take the weight off the model 's head , ' she says			2
the base is made from solid plaster with metal mesh embedded into it for extra strength			0
@entity9 prepares to take a photo of model @entity90 , who is made up as the goddess @entity5 and wearing a heavy handmade headdress finishing touches are applied by photographer @entity9 and makeup artist @entity95 the headdress in detail shows @entity9 's inspiration ; @entity99 , @entity66 gods and her trip to @entity69 in 2012 , during which she collected traditional bells and tribal necklaces the piece weighs so much that it had to be wired to a wooden beam in @entity9 's studio to take the weight off the model 's head the photographer worked alongside make - up artist is @entity113 to transform model @entity114 into the goddess			1
' wonderland is in its final phase , ' she tells @entity119			2
' it has been running for four and a half years and is entirely self funded			1
the project 's purpose is to create a extraordinary storybook without words			2
' the characters are all my own creation ; the costumes props and sets			0
i construct them like mini film sets in the woodlands around my home			0
everything is real and real scale , and can take months to make			0
@entity9 , pictured left , wearing blue , throws yellow powder at the background the photographer worked alongside make - up artist is @entity113 to transform model @entity114 into the goddess @entity114 , 25 , from @entity144 is a fashion and editorial model highly reflective gold and yellow makeup plus contoured dark shadow is applied for an otherworldly effect ' the characters are not based on anything that already exists - they are the result of my faded memories of the stories my mother read to me as a child , the original book illustrations , poems , paintings mixed up with dreams			1
i wanted to create pictures that people will project their own ideas on to , and lose themselves in			2
' the project currently has 69 pictures in the collection , with another 10 coming			0
all the new pictures , the last 10 , have been made and shot over the last 9 months , and we are now retuning with them , as well as the films			0

@entity9 has dedicated the last four and a half years of her @entity27 project to her late mother who passed away in 2008 @entity9 and @entity95 applying gold makeup onto @entity90 , transforming her into the goddess @entity5 @entity9 wanted to create a body adornment for @entity5 , which came in the form of these over sized necklace pieces			1
every part has been handmade , beaded and painted by her aside from the central traditional necklace ' i named this first portrait @entity5 , the birth of an end , as it about the last seen character @entity5 's transition from a mortal to her true goddess form			1
' i named her after the @entity4 equivalent of our @entity48 , and this picture represents her incarnation , ( birth ) surrounded by an explosion of vibrating , shimmering energy			0
as she changes so to will the landscape , creating a butterfly effect that sets in motion the end of the story			0
' it was heavily influenced by how i see the human spirit ; after losing my mother people often ask me what i imagine comes afterwards , and my only answer is my belief in an endless energy , the circle i feel we are all a part of			0
my mother is with me always , she is the earth , the rain , the wind in my hair was i walk to work			0
the body may cease , but i feel the vibrations of people continue , like ripples from a stone cast in a lake , and it was this power of spirit that i have tried to express within the picture			0
