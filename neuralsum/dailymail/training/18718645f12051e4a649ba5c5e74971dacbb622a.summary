@entity23 and @entity78 made way for @entity160 and @entity80 on 61 minutes , and the latter was immediately involved , sprinting back to stop @entity13 from bursting into the @entity1 box after the hosts had broken with lightning speed when @entity73 's header bounced back off the right - hand post			2
the visitors looked the more likely to score a winner in the closing stages as their exciting attacking trio of @entity27 , @entity86 and @entity160 caused problems in the @entity13 penalty area , and nine miuntes before the end they got their goal			0
fabregas cut in from the right - hand side , bewitched three @entity13 defenders with some quick feet , and then hooked a right - foot finish past @entity47 to make it 2 - 1			0
