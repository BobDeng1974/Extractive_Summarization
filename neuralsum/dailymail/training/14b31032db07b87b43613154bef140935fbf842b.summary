in the end , @entity0 did the decent thing			2
@entity3 have won four @entity4 and his countrymen demanded a fifth			2
@entity0 has quit , resigning after a 1 - 0 defeat against @entity8 in @entity9 knocked them out			1
@entity12 ’s head coach should have quit , too , after the worst @entity14 campaign in this country ’s history			1
@entity17 is a decent man — as we have placed on record many times — but we will be surveying the wreckage of this tournament for years to come			2
at the @entity22 in @entity23 , we could n’t even beat @entity24			2
they are ranked 28th in the world			0
two years ago @entity0 led @entity3 to the final of @entity28			1
football is a cruel game			0
instead @entity12 arrive home after the worst @entity14 showing in the history of the national team			1
their credibility as a footballing power is shot to pieces after defeats by @entity3 and @entity8 and a lifeless 0 - 0 draw with @entity24			1
at the centre of the farce is manager @entity17 , still in his job despite his failure and last night bizarrely claiming that @entity12 had n’t been outplayed or outclassed			1
he said : ‘ all i can say is we have n’t been that fortunate here ... we have n’t got the results			0
if you ’re @entity68 , and you play with eight or nine behind the ball and make incredible stops and draw 0 - 0 , you ’ve had a great game			1
that ’ll never be the case with @entity12			2
the pressure for teams like @entity12 is greater			2
’ after this debacle , expectations have never been lower			0
watching @entity17 , shredded by the experience of a @entity14 that he has already conceded he underestimated , it is time for someone else to have a crack at the top job			1
it is the most prestigious job in @entity85 football and whoever turns this team into a formidable , fighting machine in the future will be lionised			0
but the @entity35 have backed and offered their full support for @entity17 , a man who loves this job more than anything in life			0
no - one disputes that			0
after touching down in @entity12 with the rest of the squad , @entity17 will return to his new home in @entity99 to spend some time with his wife			1
it is today , and in the weeks ahead , when @entity17 has to work out a way to glue this all back together again			0
against @entity24 there was no pattern to @entity12 ’s performance , no encouragement			1
@entity17 spent the entire game in the dug - out , leaving the motioning and pointing in the technical area to his assistant @entity112			2
watching brief : @entity17 stands alongside @entity112 in the @entity12 dug - out as @entity114 looks on @entity116 humour : @entity12 fans enjoy a day in the sun despite the team 's poor showing in @entity43 it is possible that he felt embarrassed , particularly after his admission that he had underestimated the @entity14 in @entity43			1
for future reference , football tournaments do not come any bigger than this one			0
after this sterile 0 - 0 draw with the group winners , @entity17 claimed that @entity12 ’s performance had given the supporters something to cheer about			1
he said : ‘ they gave us an ovation that , obviously , our results did n’t merit			0
the reaction of the fans was quite brilliant			0
we are so sad and disappointed for them because we know what they ’re going through			0
we are very grateful for the emotional moment at the end where they showed their support			0
’ winning the battle ? @entity17 insisted @entity12 got the better of @entity24 in the middle of the park deserved applause ? @entity12 players salute the fans after their early exit from the @entity14 @entity12 finished bottom of @entity41 after losing to @entity3 and @entity8 in their opening two fixtures			1
they were spared the ultimate humiliation by drawing 0 - 0 with the group leaders to gain one point			1
it is true that the thousands who made the trip to @entity23 and were stationed behind the goal saluted the players at the whistle			0
@entity165 had run over to them and thrown his no 9 shirt into the crowd before the rest of the team arrived			0
fallen short : @entity171 tumbles after pressure from three @entity173 spelling it out : fans make their disatisfaction known in @entity23 but to think that anyone who watched this game believes this was a good performance is living in a fantasy land , and the least the fans deserve is some honesty			1
what can not be overlooked is that this tournament has been an unmitigated disaster and we are sick of hearing empty promises			1
to hear that we are building for the future again must make every supporter sick to the stomach			0
let ’s build for the here and now			0
video fans say @entity0 must go			2

@entity3 coach @entity0 resigned after @entity3 failed to get out of their group for the second @entity14 in *succession*
@entity17 should have quit , too , after @entity12 finished bottom of @entity41 on a point
against @entity24 there was no pattern to @entity12 ’s performance , no encouragement . the future is frightening
after this sterile 0 - 0 draw with the group winners , @entity17 claimed that @entity12 ’s performance had given the supporters something to cheer about
to think that anyone who watched this final group game really believes this was a good performance is living in a fantasy land
the fans deserve is some honesty
this tournament has been an unmitigated disaster and we are sick of hearing empty promises
