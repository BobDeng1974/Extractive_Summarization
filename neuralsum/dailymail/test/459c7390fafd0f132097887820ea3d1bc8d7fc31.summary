@entity1 governor @entity0 was n't looking too presidential tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting			1
and now the state 's largest teacher 's union is calling him out for his ' bullying ' behavior			2
' he 's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events , ' @entity10 of the @entity11 told @entity17			0
' it 's the one thing that never seems to change			0
' scroll down for @entity19 not being nice : @entity1 gov @entity0 ( left ) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher ( @entity22 , right ) at a tuesday night town hall meeting that sentiment does n't ring well with @entity0 's ambitions to run in the @entity27 presidential primaries next year			1
tuesday night , @entity0 appeared at @entity28 to take questions from a group of citizens , when @entity22 , a high school @entity33 from @entity34 , took the microphone			1
ms @entity22 , who has been a teacher for 27 years , questioned @entity0 's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company @entity38 which could have contributed drastically to the state 's pension plans for teachers			1
@entity0 settled the deal for $ 225million , despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $ 8.9billion which @entity22 described as ' favoring the affluent ' and ' kicking state workers under the bus '			1
' i know that you could have gotten more money , on the dollar , ' @entity22 said			0
' do you ? ' a defensive @entity0 quickly responded			2
' you do know that ? really ? you know that ? ' @entity22 started to respond , but not before being cut off by the governor			0
a good deal ? @entity22 questioned @entity0 's decision - making behind a $ 225million legal settlement			1
the state originally wanted $ 8.9billion from the oil company , and @entity22 says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees ' i mean : do you know that ? ' @entity0 continued			2
' i wan na know how you know that			0
because you 're a teacher , and you 're standing in front of students every day , conveying to them , facts - things that they need to learn			0
so i would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long , court case , that you have enough detail to know			0
' @entity22 explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting ' to be bullied '			2
' you 're not being bullied , because you 're asking me a question , i 'm going to ask you questions back , ' @entity0 says , as he continues to dodge the issue			0
' he said , " i 'm not bullying you ' as he bullied her , " ' @entity10 said of the exchange			0
perhaps the reason why @entity10 and his union responded sharply to @entity0 's town hall meeting tuesday night , is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system			1
' the fact is your union , over the course of time , has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford , ' @entity0 said tuesday .			1

the presidential *hopeful* held a town hall meeting in @entity28 on tuesday
during the meeting , high school @entity106 teacher @entity22 got up to ask the governor a question about pensions
she asked why he did n't seek a higher legal settlement in a case with @entity38 that would have contributed to the state 's pension system
@entity0 responded by *repeatedly* asking how much @entity22 knew about the deal instead of answering her question
