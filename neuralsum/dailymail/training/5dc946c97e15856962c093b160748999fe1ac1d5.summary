by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 12:52 est , 18 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:00 est , 18 december 2013 the @entity5 infant mortality rate has dropped just slightly to 6.14 deaths per 1,000 births , according to a new report from the @entity9			1
the new figure , released by the @entity9 's @entity11 , comes from an analysis of data from the most recent statistics from 2010 and though it does mark a decrease it is only a small one			2
the infant mortality rate in 2009 was 6.39 deaths per 1,000 children , meaning that the number dropped by just 4 per cent over that year span			1
infant mortality rates are used for measuring a country 's prosperity and the nation 's overall health			1
slowly decreasing : the infant mortality rate has not been released for 2011 yet , but it is expected to be down to 6.05 per cent , from 6.14 in 2010 and 6.39 in 2009 in that vein , the 6.14 figure is not a good sign for the @entity5 as it places the sole remaining superpower as one of the lowest of the world 's wealthiest nations			1
the @entity35 analyzes global health statistics and noted that the average infant mortality rate is only 4 deaths per 1,000 births			1
@entity40 reported that @entity41 held one of the lowest rankings with only 1.6 deaths per 1,000 while @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47 came in shortly after with 2 deaths			2
according to the @entity35 report , the @entity5 was ranked number 26 out of 34 wealthy countries , which is a statistic that has analysts worried			1
' while life expectancy in the @entity5 used to be one year above the @entity35 average in 1970 , it is now more than one year below the average , ' the report stated			2
birth defects and low birth weight - which was cited as connected to young mothers - were named as the main causes of @entity5 's relatively low ranking			0
still not stellar : the infant mortality rate in the @entity5 is still higher than that of many other wealthy countries , as their average is 4 per cent and the @entity5 is still more than 2 percentage points higher			1
the @entity5 looks like it is ranked more favorably in this graphic because it looks at all countries - wealthy and poor - which boosts up the @entity5 ' in reality , women with one risk factor often have other risk factors as well , ' a report by @entity78 concluded when it was released in april			2
' for example , teenage mothers are more likely to be unmarried and of a low - income status ; mothers who do not receive prenatal care are more likely to be of a low - income status and uninsured			0
' causes : premature births are the main cause for infant mortality in the @entity5 which often causes birth defects and low birth weight multiple births also play a factor as the infant mortality rate for triplets is ten times the rate for single births			1
at least one of those problems may be fixed in coming years , as @entity101 food ingredients maker @entity99 is in discussions with companies over using probiotic bacteria to reduce the risk of a deadly stomach disease among premature babies			0
an independent study by the @entity109 in @entity110 has shown that daily intake of a mix of three of @entity99 's probiotic strains more than halved the risk among premature babies of developing necrotizing enterocolitis compared with infants that received a placebo			0
the study was conducted on 1,100 children			0
' we are in dialogue with potential customers about products which addresses @entity128 directly , ' @entity122 , executive vice president of @entity99 's @entity123 , told @entity129			0
he declined to reveal which companies are involved in the talks			0
@entity99 makes cultures , colors and enzymes and has food producers like @entity136 and @entity137 as major customers .			0

@entity5 infant mortality rate was 6.39 deaths per 1,000 births in 2009 and data from 2010 has it down to 6.14
expected to continue to drop to 6.05 deaths when the 2011 data is *collected*
@entity5 is ranked in 26th place in an *evaluation* of the 34 wealthiest nations
