a student dressed up as a slave , with blood marks on his back as if he has been whipped , for throwback thursday in @entity5 parents have spoken of their horror after a student dressed up a slave , daubing red stains on his back to look like he had been whipped for throwback thursday			1
the @entity13 student had donned the costume for the tradition , which allows students to dress up in vintage outfits , at @entity5 's @entity18 in @entity19			1
but parents were angry that he had been allowed to wear the slave costume for the whole day , @entity20 reported			2

i could n't believe what i was hearing in 2015			0
are you kidding me ? ' as well as blood daubed on the back of a white shirt the student 's costume included a message that said ' @entity35			1
' he also carried a bag of cotton wool balls that he dropped throughout the campus			0
the woman added : ' what if someone came dressed as the @entity44 or the @entity45 ? is that then considered inappropriate ? where is the line ? you are dealing with teenagers			0
' @entity51 , spokesman for the school , claims the student was told his costume was ' tasteless ' and ' really pushing the boundaries			2
' he said the teenager was told if someone complained he would need to remove the outfit and he was not allowed to take part in the competition			1

as we know , free speech is not always tasteful speech			2
