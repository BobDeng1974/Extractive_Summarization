rangers are fighting an attempt to force them to pay the £ 250,000 fine levied for the @entity5 club ’s widespread use of undisclosed payments to players			1
a commission set up by the @entity9 handed oldco @entity0 the fine in february 2013 after the club failed to disclose dozens of payments worth millions of pounds from 2000 to 2011 , breaching league rules			1
the commission decided @entity0 had gained no sporting advantage and stopped short of stripping the club of titles and it appeared the issue was over as the fine was levied on a liquidated company			1
rangers are fighting an attempt to force them to pay the £ 250,000 fine levied for the @entity5 club ’s widespread use of undisclosed payments to players but @entity0 say the @entity29 - the result of a merger of the @entity9 and @entity28 - is now trying to recover the fine			1
a @entity0 statement to the stock exchange read : ' the board of the @entity29 has determined that @entity33 is liable to pay the @entity35 fine of £ 250,000 levied on @entity36 ( previously @entity38 plc ) ( in liquidation )			1
' the @entity29 has also decided that this sum will be recovered from the club by the @entity29 withholding broadcasting money and other sums due to the club but which are paid in the first instance to the @entity29			0
' an appeal has been lodged with the judicial panel of the @entity48 which has confirmed that the decision of the @entity29 is suspended pending the outcome of the appeal subject to the @entity29 ’s right to object			0
@entity53 has found himself in trouble after apparently breaking rules about dual ownership ' the board is advised that the sum is not due to @entity29 and the appeal will be pursued vigorously			0
” the payments were related to the club ’s tax - avoiding @entity62 scheme and totalled £ 9million in one season alone			2
former owner @entity65 has largely won two court cases against @entity68 over the scheme , with another one planned , but the commission focused on the club ’s use of undisclosed side letters to players rather than the legality of the payments			1
@entity76 @entity0 assumed liability for the liquidated company ’s football debts when the club ’s @entity48 membership was transferred in july 2012 but it was widely thought that the new fine would not affect the current @entity84 regime			2
the @entity48 made an agreement with @entity53 in 2012 to limit his influence at the club meanwhile , @entity0 say they will also fight another case with the @entity48			2
the club and shareholder @entity53 were this week hit with a total of five charges following the @entity48 ’s investigation into the @entity97 owner ’s dual interests			0
a second statement to the stock exchange read : ' the directors of @entity0 will take legal advice with a view to defending the actions of the company and the club robustly in relation to those matters raised by the @entity48			0
' both announcements came on a day when the @entity5 board is expected to meet to decide the fate of manager @entity111 , who last week triggered a 12 - month notice period in his contract by handing in his resignation .			0
