detox season is well and truly upon us , with sales of juice makers rocketing 275 per cent in the past week alone			1
the trendiest of all is the £ 100 @entity5 , which was one of @entity8 ’s top - sellers at @entity9 — the @entity10 is reportedly a huge fan			1
but it ’s far from the only juice maker on offer			1
@entity14 tested some of the best			1
so , which one should you buy ? the trendiest of all is the £ 100 @entity5 , which was one of @entity8 ’s top - sellers at @entity9 @entity18 @entity19 , £ 99.95 , @entity20 , @entity8 , @entity21 everyone ’s heard about the @entity5 ( this is the one @entity10 is rumoured to have chosen ) , and it ’s a nice - looking piece of kit			1
it has a strong extractor blade which completely breaks down the fruit and veg , so no need for chopping anything , and it ’s extremely efficient			1
it comes with a variety of lids and cups you can use if you want to take your drink out with you			0
easy to clean ? absolutely			0
only two parts get dirty — the cup and the lid with the rotator blade , and both go in the dishwasher			0
8/10 @entity41 @entity42 , £ 54.99 , @entity43 the @entity42 is not too noisy and extremely efficient this squat - looking juice maker is pleasing to use the minute you unwrap it — there ’s hardly any assembly to do , and it has squidgy rubber feet which keep it really stable on your worktop			1
you just have to drop your fruit and veg into the chute , which was wide enough so i did n’t have to chop anything			0
not too noisy and extremely efficient — i had a vast jug of bright orange , zingy juice in seconds			1
easy to clean ? yes ! there were just four detachable pieces , including the blade , which i washed really easily in the sink – though they could have gone in the dishwasher			0
9/10 designer looks @entity68 - @entity67 , £ 99.99 , @entity8 from the makers of the iconic toaster , this is pretty large but it looks great			1
but the chute you drop the fruit into was quite small compared to others i tried — i had to pull the oranges apart to fit them in , which was annoying , and chop the medium - sized apples into four pieces			1
from the makers of the iconic toaster , the @entity68 - @entity81 is quite large the dual - speed motor seemed to find the ripe ( peeled ) pineapple chunks i added quite tricky to manage — it slowed right down and made a funny noise and i wondered if it was going to conk out			1
but it produced nice juice			1
easy to clean ? it ’s not hard but there are an awful lot of parts to wash			2
most of it can go in the dishwasher though			0
6/10 @entity96 - saver @entity97 , £ 299.99 @entity98 , @entity99 and other retailers this extremely smart machine comes from @entity102 and is just as efficient as its heritage implies			1
consisting mainly of a cylinder , it comes in eight colours and takes up barely more space on your worktop than a kettle			0
@entity111 is an extremely smart machine with a wide funnel which means no chopping it comes with a citrus press which means that unlike nearly every other juicer , you do n’t have to peel oranges or grapefruit ( you just slice them in half instead ) and its wide funnel means no chopping			0
it boasts three patents on its design , and claims to retain 20 per cent more nutrients than conventional juicers			2
the only downside ( apart from the price ) is that it ’s pretty heavy to lift			2
easy to clean ? surprisingly so			0
all elements of it that come into contact with juice or pulp can go in the dishwasher			2
9/10 @entity137 's favourite @entity138 , £ 1,105 , @entity139 if you ’re still recovering from overspending at @entity9 , be thankful you did n’t take @entity137 ’s present advice — she recommended a gold - plated one of these for £ 3,100			1
the one i tried was made of surgical grade steel , so it costs a mere £ 1,105			2
dubbed the @entity149 of juicers , it ’s one of a new generation of twin gear , horizontal machines that masticate the fruit and veg slowly , producing absolutely delicious juice that is apparently far higher in nutrients			1
@entity137 recommended a gold - plated one of these for £ 3,100 as a great gift for @entity9 using this machine does take a little longer , around three to five minutes , or more if you ’re using green veg , and you have to chop up everything first , so it ’s not for anyone in a hurry			1
but the juice is sublime			2
easy to clean ? yes , it was pretty simple to take apart , and the gears can go in the dishwasher			0
9/10 @entity172 @entity173 £ 299.99 , @entity174 this sleek retro design looks fabulous , and it claims to produce juice with more nutrients intact because it juices slowly , so the fruit and veg retain more goodness ( see the @entity138 ) as it ’s not affected by oxidation			1
the @entity173 looks fabulous , and it claims to produce juice with more nutrients intact there ’s a large chute , so no need to chop fruit or veg , and it chugged ( quietly ) with ease through the apples and ginger i tried , crushing every last drop and churning out pulp that was almost bone dry			1
if ever a juicer is going to be sexy , this is it			0
easy to clean ? yes , but the manual says not to put the parts in the dishwasher as they ’ll wear out faster			0
10/10 @entity200 @entity201 , £ 24.99 , @entity202 juice makers below the £ 50 mark are few and far between , so this is a steal			1
looking at the manual , it only has a @entity208 ( most of those i tested were around the 800 - @entity212 mark ) , so i expected inferior results but not at all — it was great ! juice makers below the £ 50 mark are few and far between , so this @entity201 iuicer at £ 24.99 is a steal the funnel ’s a little narrow so you have to pull an orange into three pieces and push them down individually , or chop an apple into several pieces , but apart from that , it was absolutely brilliant			1
quiet , made lovely juice with no trouble , and extremely easy to operate			2
easy to clean ? easy to take apart but quite a few parts to clean , and the manual said not to use a dishwasher , which is a shame			0
8/10 @entity232 's bit of kit sage by @entity234 the @entity235 , silver , £ 299.95 , @entity8 i ’m normally suspicious of gadgets with celebrity endorsements , but i could n’t have been more wrong			1
it ’s massive , looks very serious rather than glamorous like the @entity5 , and sounds like a plane taking off			2
but what results ! sage by @entity234 the @entity235 is massive and sounds like a plane taking off i threw in three medium whole apples , a whole ( peeled ) orange , a ( peeled ) chunk of fresh ginger and a ( whole , unpeeled ) carrot , and within about 15 seconds had a jug full of the most delicious fresh - tasting juice			1
and a satisfactory lot of sludge in the pulp container			0
it is enormous , however , so not suitable for those with small kitchens			0
easy to clean ? well i did have to wash up seven parts afterwards ( though they could have gone in the dishwasher )			0
but the juice it made was so good , it was worth it			2
8/10 @entity267 @entity268 750 , £ 650 , @entity8 the publicity surrounding @entity268 machines is phenomenal , and it seems as if every time i go into @entity8 there ’s a gaggle of eager women watching a @entity268 demonstration			1
so i was keen to try this wonder gadget for myself			0
simple to operate , you can put in your chosen ingredients and leave the machine to it — it ’ll switch itself off when done			0
the @entity268 juicer is not too noisy , despite the ice cubes , and its strength was impressive i threw in big ice cubes , pineapple , handfuls of spinach , blueberries , oranges , and a piece of ginger and within about 20 seconds was left with a vast jug of seriously good , silkily smooth juice			2
not too noisy , despite the ice cubes , and its strength was impressive			0
easy to clean ? yes , very			0
just the jug and its lid			0
you ’re advised not to put them in the dishwasher , but there ’s not a lot to do by hand			2
9/10 best for beginners @entity309 , £ 99.98 , @entity174 or @entity21 endorsed by @entity311 , or the juice master to his fans , this is a nice little machine , and a good one to go for if you ’re new to making juice and do n’t want to spend the earth			1
it has a fairly wide chute , so i did n’t have to chop up the small apple , carrots or clementines i dropped in , and it does n’t take up too much space on the worktop			0
not the most attractive piece of kit , but it made short work of the fruit and fresh ginger i tried in it , and the motor was pretty quiet , too			0
easy to clean ? not bad			0
there were a few pieces but they came apart easily and could have gone in the dishwasher			0
8/10 the @entity309 is a nice little machine , and a good one to go for if you ’re new to making juice			2
