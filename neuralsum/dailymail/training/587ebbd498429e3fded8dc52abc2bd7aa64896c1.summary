the unemployment rate fell to 0.74 per cent in the three months to october , down 0.3 percentage points on may to july however , if the trend continues and unemployment falls to 7 per cent , interest rates could be allowed to rise by the @entity29 from their current record low of 0.5 per cent			1
millions of homeowners would then see their monthly mortgage repayments start to rise , although experts believe this is unlikely to happen before 2015			0
there are now 2.39 million out of work after the largest quarterly fall in more than a decade			0
the number of people in work reached 30.09 million – an increase of 250,000 over the quarter and of almost half a million compared with a year ago			1

with the employment rate jumping from 9.2 per cent a year ago to 10 per cent , this equates to another 109,000 @entity52 workers , according to the @entity44			2
@entity53 of @entity54 said : ‘ people are living longer , so many want to carry on working			0
however rock - bottom annuity rates combined with low interest rates on savings mean that others have no choice but to carry on working because they can not afford to retire			2
’ mr @entity11 said : ‘ there should not be one ounce of complacency because we have still got work to do to get our country back to work , and everyone back in work means greater stability for them , greater ability to plan for their future , greater help for their families			1
but the plan is working , let ’s stick at it and get unemployment down even further			2
’ the number unemployed for more than 12 months fell by 33,000 to 866,000 , the lowest rate for a year , while youth unemployment dipped by 19,000 to 941,000			1

‘ it ’s good our economy is creating more jobs , but the problem is too many of them are part - time or low paid or insecure , ’ he said			0

the only way is to keep on with our economic plan , keep cutting unemployment , keep taxes down , cut the deficit so we keep interest rates down			1
