by @entity0 published : 09:28 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 24 october 2013 tragic : @entity1 died after a paramedic refused to treat him while he was suffering a severe asthma attack a trainee driving instructor was left to die on his kitchen floor after an experienced paramedic failed to spot signs he was having a severe asthma attack , an inquest has heard			1
@entity1 , 30 , dialled 999 after falling critically ill at his @entity11 home in 2010			1
@entity12 , 69 , from @entity13 , arrived at the scene but left after just 16 minutes , refusing to assess mr @entity1 because he was being ' uncooperative '			1
but , the victim 's reluctance to let the medic treat him may have been an indication he was suffering a severe shortage of oxygen			2
the paramedic of 43 years also left vital life - saving equipment in his car and failed to test the amount of oxygen in the patient 's body , despite his severe breathing problems			1
mr @entity12 then left the property in @entity11 because he was not concerned for mr @entity1 's health as he did not look ' pale or clammy '			1
but just an hour after mr @entity12 left mr @entity1 alone his mother @entity31 , 66 found him collapsed on the kitchen floor and he died two hours later			1
an inquest at @entity34 heard the trainee driving instructor ’s life could probably have been saved if had simply been taken to hospital			1
@entity40 coroner @entity39 said : ' there was a failure to determine whether @entity1 ’s lack of co-operation was due to hypoxia or any other medical condition or whether he was just being non-compliant			2
collapsed : mr @entity1 ( pictured with girlfriend @entity47 in @entity48 ) died two hours after the ambulance left his home ' there was also a failure to measure @entity1 ’s oxygen saturation which could be vital in assessing a patients ’ respiratory level			2
' on the balance of probabilities , if @entity1 had been given appropriate treatment and been conveyed to hospital it is likely he would have survived			1
' the two - day inquest heard that when mr @entity12 attended the ' category a ' 999 call he twice failed to get mr @entity1 to blow into a peak flow meter			1
after failing to blow hard enough , @entity1 ' threw himself ' onto his bed and ' shrugged away ' mr @entity12 ’s hand			1
the paramedic then called his control room before leaving the property			2
giving evidence at the hearing mr @entity12 told the family : ' may i say i feel dreadful			2
' i ca n’t imagine how you feel			0
for your loss i am very sorry			0
' career : mr @entity1 was training to be a driving instructor before he passed away discovered : @entity77 , 66 , found her son collapsed on the kitchen floor after he had been abandoned by the medic speaking after the inquest , mr @entity12 , who has since retired , added : ' it is incredibly sad and distressing what has happened			1
' in my experience , he did not cause me concern from his physical signs			0
life - long illness : mr @entity1 ( pictured here age 12 ) was diagnosed with asthma from a very early age ' i made a decision and it has turned into a very sad state of affairs and as i hope the family can now get some peace			2
' i have been going over what happened for the last three years , thinking , maybe i could have done things differently			0
' i wished he spoke to me , but he did n’t and i will have to live with that			0
' dr @entity99 , a heart consultant at @entity101 , said he believed mr @entity1 would have survived if he had been taken to hospital for treatment straight away			1
independent medical expert , @entity104 , compiled a report for the coroner and also concluded he had concerns about the ' quality of care ' the patient had received			0
the coroner told the family she would be writing to @entity13 - which was branded as the @entity113 ’s worst performing trust earlier this year			0
they were placed at the bottom of a league table measuring response times and launched an investigation this year into the deaths of 13 patients , including one person who died after an ambulance took four hours to reach them			0
after the case mr @entity1 's devastated mother , @entity31 , added : ' @entity1 was diagnosed with asthma from a very early age and it affected him throughout life			2
poor performance : @entity13 was ranked the worst in the country after recording the longest response times ' his passion was driving , he could do that just like everyone else and was training to be a driving instructor			0
' my son was very special , he was a big family man , he would visit everyone and would be there to help whenever anyone needed something			0
' his death has affected the family badly and he is sorely missed			0
' it has taken three and a half years to get to the point we are at now and things do not get any easier , we miss him dearly			0
' @entity13 have been approached for a comment but have not yet responded .			0
