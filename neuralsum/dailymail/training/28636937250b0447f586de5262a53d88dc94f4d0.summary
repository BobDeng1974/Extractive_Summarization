by @entity0 under fire : secretary of state for health , @entity3 a secret plan to sell confidential medical records to private companies for as little as £ 1 has been drawn up by officials			1
from next month , @entity8 will start sending detailed @entity10 patient records to a central database for the first time under the new @entity13 ( @entity13 )			2
yet doctors do not have to tell patients about the project , described by campaigners as an ‘ unprecedented threat ’ to medical confidentiality			1
the records – held for every person registered with a gp – will contain details of medical conditions , as well as ‘ identifiable ’ information including a patient ’s @entity10 number , postcode and date of birth			2
private firms such as @entity31 can then apply to the @entity32 to buy and use data from the records for research			1
the project is being driven by @entity39 , the new super quango , after health secretary @entity3 made it clear he wanted a data revolution in the @entity32			1
mr @entity3 argues that sharing gp records with universities and private companies will provide a valuable tool for medical research , monitoring flu outbreaks and screening for common diseases			1
but privacy campaigners last night warned there were ‘ huge risks ’ with putting so much patient information into so many hands			1
@entity55 , director of @entity56 , said : ‘ the more people who have access to sensitive data , the greater the risk that it will not be protected properly			2
we ’ve seen that on umpteen occasions in the past			2
‘ and when there ’s a financial element involved , it introduces all sorts of incentives that are not necessarily about protecting privacy			2
’ critical : liberty director @entity55 says it will infringe privacy @entity73 , of campaign group @entity74 , said : ‘ they are presenting this as some anodyne thing that ’s only going to be used for health research			1
but this is a massive re-engineering of how everybody ’s medical records are going to be used			2
it is an unprecedented threat to our medical confidentiality			1
’ mr @entity3 believes that allowing universities and private groups access health information easier will attract pharmaceutical companies and life sciences firms to the @entity91			1
from next month , 100 gp surgeries in @entity39 will upload details from patient records to a central database held by the @entity96 ( @entity96 )			0
sensitive medical information will be included – for example whether a patient suffers from a condition such as cancer , heart disease or depression – as well as lifestyle information such as alcohol consumption			0
names and addresses will not be uploaded , but ‘ patient identifiable data ’ including date of birth , postcode , gender and ethnicity will			0
using publicly available records such as electoral rolls – which contain postcode and dates of birth information – malicious individuals could then identify who the patient records belong to			0
there are 55 organisations accredited to apply for identifiable or sensitive data			0
most are @entity10 bodies but also on the list are @entity31 , the hospital comparison firm @entity127 and the @entity128			0
confidentiality : doctors are supposed to uphold patients ' privacy the @entity96 currently charges tens of thousands of pounds for carrying out a typical ‘ data extract ’ request			1
but last month @entity134 , chief data officer at @entity39 , announced proposals to reduce these costs to just £ 1 a time			0
ms @entity55 added : ‘ @entity39 are not promoting an honest debate about this , either with individual patients or the public at large			0
’ initially , only information put on medical records from april 1 , 2013 , will be included on the uploads to @entity96			0
however , mr @entity73 claims @entity39 want to include full medical records going back 20 @entity144 said : ‘ this is a wholesale rewriting of the deal between patient and doctor			0
when people go to the gp , they go for medical treatment – they do n’t expect commodification of their patient record			0
’ an @entity39 spokesman denied the organisation was failing to tell patients about the scheme or promote it			0
and a @entity161 spokesman said : ‘ @entity3 has made clear that any patient who does not want personal data to be shared securely with @entity96 will have their objection respected			1

campaigners describe plan as ' unprecedented threat ' to confidentiality
health secretary @entity3 says it will be a ' boon to research '
