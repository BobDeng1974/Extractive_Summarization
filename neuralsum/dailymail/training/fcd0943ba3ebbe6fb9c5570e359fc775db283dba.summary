the most talented young player sir @entity1 has seen on a training pitch is on the market and available			1
it was three years ago when @entity6 became tired of his antics and sent him packing			2
now @entity10 too have reached the conclusion @entity12 is damaged goods			1
banned from @entity10 ’s first - team training ground as they continue to flirt with the top six , @entity14 has demanded that he ‘ changes his whole life ’ and — in the meantime — trains with the reserves elsewhere in @entity19 , away from their @entity21 base			1
@entity10 midfielder @entity23 is not wanted by the club and is available on a free transfer @entity12 's only @entity27 appearance for @entity10 this season was against @entity29 in august midfielder @entity12 appears to smoke a cigar ( left ) and chats on the phone in august , 2014 ( right ) the talented midfielder takes a shot against @entity35 during a loan spell at @entity37 last season teams played for : @entity10 , @entity40 ( loan ) , @entity37 ( loan ) , @entity43 ( loan ) , @entity6 appearances : 81 goals : 14 honours : @entity47 ( 2011 ) such is his declining reputation , @entity12 — ambitiously considered by some to be a contender for the @entity51 with @entity52 last summer — has let it be known that , if anyone will take him , he will sign a new contract with all the risk on his side			1
@entity12 is seeking a relatively modest £ 15,000 a week ( the same wage he is paid by @entity10 )			1
and there is a further incentive for his next club : he is prepared to waive any right to compensation should a club terminate his employment for stepping out of line			1
even then , one @entity27 chairman approached by @entity12 ’s advisers this week described it as ‘ too risky ’ , and could not be convinced otherwise even when it was pointed out the risk was all @entity12 ’s			1
in @entity52 , according to one source close to @entity12 , clubs are ‘ paralysed by fear ’ when presented with the prospect of hiring him			1
they can see he has ability , outrageous ability			0
and they remember the goals			0
but they also fear , in the high - stakes world of @entity27 football , that introducing @entity12 to a dressing room could prove incredibly divisive			1
one imagines they are influenced by the stories they hear ; some well documented , some less so			0
but as events at @entity91 have demonstrated this week , not all of them are true			0
@entity12 poses with three friends in a picture posted to his official @entity95 account in february 2014 @entity12 was controversially pictured wearing an @entity97 home shirt before the start of the current season the 21 - year - old made seven championship appearances and failed to score during a loan spell with @entity40 talking this week to people who have encountered @entity12 , to people who know him extremely well too , the lack of consistency in their accounts of the 21 - year - old is every bit as startling as the stories themselves			1
one reason given for why @entity10 lost patience with @entity12 was the suspicion that he had been driving without a licence			1
it is true @entity12 is yet to pass his test but his representatives insist that he , like any learner driver , always has a qualified driver of the correct age siting alongside him			1
when the allegation was put to one source who was keen to defend @entity12 , he rather worryingly replied : ‘ he has n’t done that ( driven ) for weeks and weeks			1
’ concern about whether @entity12 will turn up fuels the doubt in the boardroom , even among the @entity27 ’s most desperate clubs such as @entity37 , @entity131 and @entity132			1
it is claimed he went awol for a few days during the @entity135 period of 2013			0
the reason has since been given as emergency dental work , the records of which were then presented to the club			2
over the years he does appear to have missed training without proper explanation and it is said he was even late reporting for a recent under 21 game , although coaches at @entity10 are said to have been impressed by the midfielder these past few weeks , not least with his attitude and application			1
clearly the relationship with @entity14 has disintegrated , with claims and counter claims as to why that is			1
@entity14 has denied his own representatives once tried to recruit @entity12 from his current agent when negotiations with the club over a new contract broke down			1
but @entity14 , like sir @entity1 before him , has decided he does not want the kid around , however good he might be			1
@entity12 's last start for @entity10 came in their @entity160 defeat by @entity161 in august last year the former @entity6 youngster regularly posts pictures of himself on his @entity95 account @entity12 scored this memorable solo goal in a 3 - 0 win against @entity168 rivals @entity167 in october 2013 after returning recently from an unsuccessful loan spell at @entity40 , @entity14 expressed his concern earlier this week that @entity12 may ‘ struggle ’ to find a new club			1
‘ it ’s the old metaphor is n’t it ; you can lead the horse to water but you ca n’t make it drink , ’ he said			0
‘ if they do n’t want to take it on board , then there ’s little they can do			0
it ’s very difficult to sit and watch such a great talent			0
he just has to change his whole life and then hopefully somewhere down the line he ’ll become the player he should be			0
’ it is not just @entity14 and @entity1 , either			1
@entity191 had @entity12 at @entity37 for a loan spell and is said to have ‘ quite liked the lad ’			1
he recognised , at least away from the pitch , that he could be polite and respectful			2
he even entertained the idea of having him back			0
but @entity191 also reflected in his book how frustrating @entity12 can be			1
‘ if he ’d played consistently at his best , he might have gone to the @entity51 , ’ said @entity191			0
‘ but on his bad days you would n’t put him in our reserve team			0
‘ the kid can really play			0
he goes past people and makes them look silly			0
he does n’t run , he glides			0
‘ by the time we came to the end of the season , though , he could n’t get in our starting line - up			2
he ’s an amazing talent but his attitude makes you think about where he will be in six years ’ time			0
’ @entity12 made 17 appearances for @entity37 last season but dropped out of the team near the end of the campaign @entity12 's mother @entity215 ( left ) is said to have strong moral principles and is a central figure in his life @entity12 came through @entity6 's academy but was let go by sir @entity1 in 2012 an 18 - year - old @entity12 celebrates after scoring for @entity6 's under 18s against @entity221 in the @entity47 @entity191 tells a story of how @entity12 responded with a ‘ petulant pout ’ when he asked him ‘ to do a job ’ on the left flank in one game			1
and only after a serious talking - to did he respond the way his manager demanded			2
‘ in the second half it was like watching a player with @entity233 ’s class in the @entity234 , ’ writes @entity191			0
he also recalls a story told to him by @entity236 , who as the manager at @entity43 also had the player on loan			0
@entity236 told @entity12 he was ‘ the best player since @entity240 ’			1
‘ who ’s @entity240 ? ’ @entity12 is said to have replied			2
this is not necessarily what puts off @entity27 clubs and their managers			0
it is the more serious stuff			0
the stuff that has led to @entity12 appearing in a courtroom and only narrowly escaping a jail sentence in february 2011			2
@entity12 received a 12 - month referral order and was ordered to pay costs and compensation after admitting to two counts of witness intimidation			1
it related to threats made to a mugging victim in an effort to stop him giving evidence against two people , described in court as ‘ friends or associates ’ of @entity12 , accused of carrying out the attack			2
a district judge , warning that @entity12 would be locked up for a year if he got in trouble again , described his behaviour as ‘ appalling ’			1
a further charge of assault was dropped when @entity12 ’s girlfriend refused to testify			2
he was , however , convicted of criminal damage for throwing her mobile phone from a window and advised to undergo domestic violence counselling			0
@entity12 , pictured in action against @entity277 's under 21 side , is yet to represent his country at senior level @entity281 target @entity12 looks relaxed in this photo taken after he 'd eaten dinner on @entity135 @entity12 , pictured with @entity284 , scored twice in the @entity47 final in 2011 to help @entity6 lift the trophy this week three more charges brought against @entity12 , for assaulting his ex-girlfriend and her mother , were withdrawn at @entity91			1
the prosecutor told the court the charges had been dropped after @entity12 ’s defence team recovered @entity295 footage of the first alleged assault outside a @entity298 nightclub			2
the video showed @entity12 had not hit his ex-girlfriend , as was alleged , and it appeared that she had simply ‘ slumped ’ to the floor			2
the young woman also withdrew her statement alleging @entity12 later assaulted her outside her home when he dropped her off in his @entity305 , while there was also ‘ reluctance ’ from her mother to proceed over the alleged assault on her			2
his representatives dread to think what might have happened had that @entity295 footage not materialised			0
after all , his ex-girlfriend is understood to have sustained injuries to her face when she fell			0
but even though the charges were withdrawn , with the @entity295 evidence showing that he was actually rather chivalrous that night , some damage has been done			0
a video of him emerging from @entity318 after the initial arrest became a @entity321 sensation available to any prospective employer			0
@entity12 is said to have been brought up by his grandparents in one of the more deprived areas of @entity298 , the impression being that he had a difficult upbringing			2
this is not quite true			0
there was a spell when he lived with his grandparents and his childhood was not always easy			0
but a mother said to have strong moral principles is a central figure in his life .			0

@entity10 boss @entity14 wants @entity23 to find a new club
the talented midfielder will be allowed to leave @entity340 for nothing
@entity12 was let go by sir @entity1 after trouble off the pitch
the 21 - year - old is struggling to convince another club to take him on
@entity12 is willing to waive compensation if his contract is terminated
