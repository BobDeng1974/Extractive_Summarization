@entity0 today handed a £ 3,000 boost to first time buyers to make it easier to get on the housing ladder			1
in his final budget before the general election , the chancellor announced a new ' help - to - buy @entity8 ' only available to those yet to buy their first home			0
the new savings account will see the government add £ 50 to every £ 200 which savers manage to put away towards a deposit			1
it will mean that anyone who saves £ 12,000 towards a deposit will have it topped up by £ 3,000			2
but critics said it will still take first - time buyers five years to save the cash by which time house prices will have soared by another £ 15,000			1
he said : ' at first glance , a handout of up to £ 3,000 from the government for hopeful first time buyers looks too good to be true			1
' but to get your maximum £ 3,000 bonus , with maximum monthly payments of just £ 200 , you 'll be saving for four and a half long years			1
by which time , prices will likely have risen again and a £ 15,000 deposit wo n't be enough			0
' the accounts will only be available for the next four years , but once they have been opened there will be no limit on how long people can save for			2
they will be available through banks and building societies this @entity49 , with first time buyers able to make an initial deposit of £ 1,000 when they open the account			1
there will be no minimum monthly deposit – but people will only be able to save up to £ 200 a month			2
the government has also capped the total bonus they will pay at £ 3,000			1
the chancellor said the soaring size of deposits was making it harder for first - time buyers to get on the housing ladder according to @entity67 documents released today , people outside @entity66 now need almost £ 30,000 for a deposit on their first home , while in @entity66 they need almost £ 70,000 first - time buyers in @entity66 will be allowed to use the bonus to buy homes worth up to £ 450,000 - but for everyone else the ceiling will be £ 250,000			1
unveiling the new savings accounts in the @entity76 this afternoon , mr @entity0 said they were needed because of the growing size of deposits			2
according to @entity67 documents released today , first - time buyers in @entity66 now need almost £ 70,000 to get their first home			1
outside @entity66 people need almost £ 30,000			0
soaring house prices and tighter mortgage rules have made it harder for first time buyers to get on the housing ladder mr @entity0 told @entity86 : ' the help to buy @entity8 for first time buyers works like this			1
for every £ 200 you save for your deposit , the government will top it up with £ 50 more			1
it 's as simple as this – we 'll work hand in hand to help you buy your first home			0
this is a budget that works for you			0
' a 10 per cent deposit on the average first home costs £ 15,000 , so if you put in up to £ 12,000 – we 'll put in up to £ 3,000 more			2
' a 25 per cent top - up is equivalent to saving for a deposit from your pre-tax income – it 's effectively a tax cut for first time buyers			1
we 'll work with industry so it 's ready for this autumn and we 'll make sure you can start saving for it right now			0
' the new accounts will be limited to only one person rather than one home – meaning couples can receive a double bonus			0
but the small print of the scheme reveals that people will not be able to use the bonus to buy properties abroad			0
the new @entity125 were part of a raft of measures to help people 's savings go further			0
the chancellor said new rules would be introduced to stop people paying any interest on their savings			0
people will be able to make £ 1,000 of interest on their savings before any tax is applied			2
the move will take 95 per cent of people out of savings taxes			0
workers will also be able to earn £ 11,000 before paying income tax at all .			0
