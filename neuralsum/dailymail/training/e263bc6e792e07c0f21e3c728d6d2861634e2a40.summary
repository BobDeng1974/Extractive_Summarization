it seems phone batteries always die at the same moment you need to make an important call			0
but while shouting at your mobile in frustration might seem pointless , a new gadget could soon mean your screams wo n't be in vain			0
researchers in @entity11 have created a new technology that uses sound , such as chants at a football ground or chatter in a coffee shop , to charge up mobile phones			2
researchers in @entity11 have created a new technology that uses sound , such as chants at a football ground or chatter in a coffee shop , to charge up mobile phones their prototype device , which is about the size of a mobile phone , uses zinc oxide to convert vibrations caused by sound into electricity			1
the invention was inspired by previous research at @entity38 ( @entity38 ) , which found playing pop and rock music improved the performance of solar cells			1
this was because the sound vibrations triggered the movement of material in the solar cell that caused it to improve efficiency by up to 40 per cent			2
developing this research further , @entity49 worked with the @entity38 team to create an energy - harvesting prototype that could be used to charge a mobile phone using everyday background noise			1

pictured here is the zinc oxide used in the device the team used the key properties of zinc oxide , a material that when squashed or stretched creates a voltage by converting energy from motion into electrical energy , in the form of nanorods			1
the nanorods can be coated onto various surfaces in different locations making the energy harvesting versatile			0
when this surface is squashed or stretched , the nanorods then generate a high voltage			0
the latest research was inspired by a study last year that found playing pop and rock music improves the performance of solar cells			1
scientists at @entity38 and @entity84 found sound vibrations triggered the movement of material in the solar cell causing it to improve efficiency by up to 40 per cent			1
this discovery could make it possible to power a wider range of devices with solar energy than at present , as scientists can improve the efficiency of solar cells using the ambient , or background , noise present in many environments			1
practical uses for this discovery could include solar powered air conditioning units , laptop computers or electronic components on buses , trains and other vehicles			0
the nanorods respond to vibration and movement created by everyday sound , such as our voices			2
electrical contacts on both sides of the rods are then used to harvest the voltage to charge a phone			0
in order to make it possible to produce these nanogenerators at scale , the scientists found innovative ways to cut costs in the production process			0
firstly , they developed a process whereby they could spray on the nanorod chemicals - almost like nanorod graffiti - to cover a plastic sheet in a layer of zinc oxide			1
when put into a mixture of chemicals and heated to just 90 Â° c , the nanorods grew all over the surface of the sheet			0
secondly , gold is traditionally used as an electrical contact , but the team were able to produce a method of using cheap and cheerful aluminium foil instead			0
the final device is the same size as a @entity148 and generates five volts , which is enough to charge a phone			2
' being able to keep mobile devices working for longer , or do away with batteries completely by tapping into the stray energy that is all around us is an exciting concept , ' said dr @entity156 from @entity38			2
' we hope that we have brought this technology closer to viability			0

pictured is the voltage test to see how much energy the device could harvest			0

prototype created by @entity38 and @entity49
the device , which is about the size of a mobile phone , uses zinc oxide
zinc oxide produces electricity when *subjected* to *mechanical* stress
stress could come from vibrations in sound that move tiny rods
invention was inspired by research which found playing pop and rock music improves the performance of solar cells
