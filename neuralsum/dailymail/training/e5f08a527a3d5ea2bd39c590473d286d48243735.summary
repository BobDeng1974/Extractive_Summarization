that can not be right			0
' drifter : @entity20 @entity19 was convicted of decapitating ms @entity10 and sentenced to 20 years in a psychiatric unit the @entity113 in @entity146 told @entity74 @entity147 : ' the @entity113 is naturally deeply sympathetic to the predicament of the family of the deceased and fully understands their desire to seek answers			1
' our detailed investigations into the treatment provided to mr @entity19 are continuing and it would be premature to offer comment at this stage			2
' any response we are able to provide is , in any event , likely to be limited due to confidentiality restrictions imposed on us under the @entity163			0
