@entity0 cited 18 years in the @entity2 goldfish bowl as his reason for quitting @entity4			1
a former @entity6 development coach , @entity0 moved to @entity7 as first - team coach when @entity9 returned as manager in 2007			1
assistant to @entity12 for four years he was thrust into the spotlight as caretaker manager when @entity12 was placed on gardening leave			1
@entity0 cited 18 years in the @entity2 goldfish bowl as his reason for quitting @entity4 uncomfortable in the role , @entity0 compounded the storm clouds over @entity7 when he resigned on wednesday after just three games in charge			1
the interim boss will remain in the technical area as he serves 12 months ’ notice , but admitted he needs a break from the chaos of recent times			1
‘ to be quite frank , the last four years have been tough , ’ said @entity0 , explaining his shock decision for the first time			1
‘ that aside , i have been nearly 18 years at the @entity2 and it takes its toll			1
‘ i just told the club i ’m happy to honour my contract for the next 12 months and then step aside			1
i ’m not complaining because you ca n’t be involved in clubs like these and not have stress – it ’s all part and parcel of the job			2
‘ it was a really tough decision			2
i made it last wednesday and the club received a letter on the thursday			1
‘ in terms of making the decision , after having discussions with my family i felt it was the right thing to do at this point in my career			2
‘ i have had fantastic times but i just feel i will do my 12 months then step aside , take a break and see where it takes me			1
i expect to be here for the next 12 months unless i ’m told otherwise			1
’ assistant to @entity12 for four years he was thrust into the spotlight when @entity12 resigned wary of the impact his decision would have on his stuttering side ’s promotion bid , @entity0 asked for the news to be kept in - house			1
disappointed it then leaked , he admitted : ‘ i tendered my resignation on the thursday after deciding the day before i was going to do it			2
‘ but it came out on tv , so the players saw it before i could get to them			2
i just had to tell them and ask that they keep working hard			2
was i surprised when it came out ? yeah			0
i was working my notice so ( it was supposed it to remain in - house ) for 12 months			1
’ he had pondered his options for some time			0
‘ when @entity73 was put on gardening leave and i was appointed as caretaker manager i was happy to do so			2
assistant managers do it all the time			0
‘ once the dust settled a wee bit and i had time to think it through this is what i have come up with			0
it ’s maybe time i had a break			0
’ notice periods in football rarely work , as even @entity9 and @entity86 can testify , with many professional footballers subconsciously compelled to down tools the moment their gaffer calls it quits			2
@entity4 caretaker boss @entity0 speaks to @entity92 manager @entity91 earlier in january publicly , @entity0 and his players — as they must — will make the right noises			1
yet the truth is this			0
if an already stuttering promotion campaign suffered further water damage in @entity99 on saturday , no one would be remotely surprised			0
neither can anyone offer cast - iron assurances that a team which has lost two managers in a month will be ‘ at it ’ against @entity6 in the @entity106 semi final at @entity107 next weekend			0
asked if those in his charge are up for the task right now , @entity0 replied : ‘ i absolutely hope so , but can i guarantee it ? i have said to the boys they have my respect and i expect it back			1
‘ they have worked very well this week and we look forward to the league game at @entity99			2
‘ i can only ask them to keep at it			0
i pick the team and once they go out on the park , you need them to play , whether it ’s @entity4 , @entity123 or @entity124			1
they are paid to play and you hope they would want to do it for themselves as much as anything			0
’ in mitigation , the @entity4 players can plead a level of disruption which , even by @entity134 football standards , is unparalleled			1
@entity0 has urged them to draw on the levels of professionalism which took them to the club in the first place			1
however , asked if there was a legitimate worry they may ‘ chuck it ’ and begin to think of their own future first and foremost , @entity0 nodded : ‘ i would n’t disagree with you			1
when the news came out , i had to get the boys in the next morning and explain my situation			0
@entity0 moved to @entity7 as first - team coach when @entity9 returned as manager in 2007 ‘ a lot of them are out of contract in the summer , too , so all i could do was be as honest as i can over why i did it			1
i told them they have to play for themselves and look after their own futures			0
’ what comes now for @entity0 is far from clear			1
cast into a hot seat he looked uncomfortable with from the start , he may have expected the @entity4 board to follow the path adopted for @entity12 and place him on gardening leave			1
@entity0 , you sense , could live with it if they did			1
‘ i was surprised to be appointed , ’ he conceded			0
‘ i ca n’t say i expected it			0
i ’m not going to say i had my boots all polished and i was ready to step in			0
‘ of course , it was a big task but i was probably as experienced as anybody out there , given what i have learned over my career			0
‘ but absolutely , it ’s a daunting task			0
you have to get on with it			0
it ’s a great opportunity and a massive honour for me to be the caretaker manager for the team i supported as a boy			2
‘ never in a million years would i have thought i ’d be leading the team out on a saturday and that ’s why it was such a difficult decision to resign			2
@entity0 said he expects to serve his 12 months notice , unless the board tell him otherwise ‘ who would n’t want to manage a club of this size ? i am not any different from anyone else , but unfortunately the circumstances are what they are			1
i ’ve made my decision for myself and my family and that ’s where i am at the moment			2
’ in the statement confirming his departure , the board suggested he would carry on for the next 12 months with ‘ normal duties ’			1
‘ i ’m still trying to think what is normal at the moment , ’ he grinned			0
‘ this job is totally different from when i came here eight years ago			2
‘ the staff has been diluted from when @entity9 brought me as his first - team coach and @entity73 was assistant			0
‘ i ’m sure i ’ll sit down with a glass of wine some night and say : “ wow ”			0
i ’ll think : “ that was an incredible journey			0
” ‘ but i ’m still in it and i ’m focused on winning the game at @entity99 , and we need to try to peg @entity92 back			0
if we ca n’t do that , then it ’s the play - offs			0
but we need to try to get promotion and get the club back to where it should be			0
’ meanwhile , @entity0 declined to comment on the @entity221 charging goalkeeper @entity222 over breaches of gambling rules after he was alleged to have bet on 55 matches , although none involving @entity4			1
‘ the club issued a statement and i ca n’t comment any further until after the hearing , ’ he said			0
