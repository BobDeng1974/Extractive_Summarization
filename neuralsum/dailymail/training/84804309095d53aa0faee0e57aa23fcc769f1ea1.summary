domestically , families made up 33 percent of the audience of the @entity65 ' @entity30 2 , ' a high percentage for a superhero film			0
' it did seem to have a very strong component to the film , which we felt was an opportunity , ' @entity61 said			0

" but as @entity17 's summer rolls on , the competition gets stiffer			2
