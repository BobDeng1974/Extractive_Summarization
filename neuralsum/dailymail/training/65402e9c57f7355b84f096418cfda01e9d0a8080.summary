@entity0 has thrown a ‘ huge rock ’ at the intelligence agencies – and his leaks mean a terrorist atrocity was now certain to ‘ get through ’ , according to the former head of @entity5			1
sir @entity8 ’ warning came as @entity9 posted a @entity11 video showing fanatics how to avoid detection , apparently based on the former @entity16 officer ’s leaks			1
yesterday , former @entity5 boss sir @entity8 said the revelations had made the technology companies more reluctant to co-operate with the police and spy agencies			1
@entity5 boss sir @entity8 ( pictured ) warned @entity0 has thrown ' huge rock ' at intelligence agencies , meaning a terrorist atrocity is now certain to ' get through ' security officials fear this has created ‘ no - go areas ’ on the internet where terrorists can plot atrocities undetected			1
sir @entity8 warned that , unless a ‘ new compact ’ could be agreed between web firms and the intelligence agencies , attacks like those in @entity34 earlier this month would become ‘ a more regular feature of our lives ’			1
he said : ‘ @entity0 threw a massive rock in the pool			0
the ripples from that have still not died down			0
‘ it was certainly a great concern for me that the , if you like , informal co-operation that worked well between most technology companies and communication companies and security services was broken by the @entity0 revelations and has not been repaired			1
’ sir @entity8 added : ‘ the security community has done a fantastic job keeping threats at bay , but if i was to sit here and ask “ will the goalkeepers of the police and security services foil every single attempt to score a goal ? ” , the answer is no. at some point a threat will get through			1
’ @entity64 security officials have long warned the @entity0 revelations could be used to produce a ‘ handbook for terrorists ’			1
the chilling seven - and - a - half minute video by @entity9 – which includes news footage of @entity0 ’s massive security breach – confirms these worst fears			1
the recording provides detailed graphics on how extremists can avoid being trapped by ‘ @entity75 secret spying technology ’ when communicating			1
extracts from the video by @entity9 – and the corresponding leaks by treacherous former @entity16 officer @entity0 ( pictured right ) : @entity79 : @entity80 and @entity81 are harvesting millions of emails , instant messaging contact lists and details of internet browsing histories			1
@entity99 : ‘ all your calls , messages and internet history are stored in this same place … spies have access to these files and can know your daily routine , friends and what you are planning to do tomorrow night at that tall building …			0
’ @entity79 : @entity101 agencies have the capacity to track and map the location of cell phones			1
@entity99 : ‘ all mobile phone providers use the same software , your device continuously is in contact with the nearest tower … as you are moving around your different coordinates are tracked and stored			0
’ @entity79 : security officials were paying private tech companies for ‘ clandestine access ’ to their communications networks			1
@entity99 guidance : the video warns @entity9 agents that spies are working with internet companies and lists networks which have been co-operating so they can be avoided			1
it also claims to identify technology companies which are co-operating with the @entity64 and other countries so they can be avoided			2
there is a list of software packages that can be used to try to thwart @entity81 and the intelligence agencies			0
the video is spoken in @entity129 but with @entity131 subtitles			0
it says : ‘ @entity134 created us with a unique voice , this can be used to track you anywhere no matter [ sic ] you buy a new phone , sim card or satellite			2
' we will now show you some different ways how the enemy can track you and have a view at some modern war technologies			0
’ it added : ‘ every mujahed that does not take the right precautions can be a tool in the hand of the enemy			2
with his phone , tablet or laptop the enemy can listen / record all conversations and meetings			0
’ deputy prime minister @entity158 ( left ) is blocking proposals to give @entity64 's spooks the power to monitor what people browse on the internet and who they are emailing experts said @entity0 – feted as a hero by some campaigners – had inspired the tape			2
sir @entity8 ’s speech yesterday , his first since stepping down last november , was the second time in a week an ex-head of the intelligence agencies has attacked @entity0			1
last tuesday , @entity176 boss @entity175 said the revelations have left @entity64 less able to protect itself at a time when the terrorist threat from @entity182 fanatics is surging			2
in the wake of the @entity34 attacks , @entity183 vowed that a new @entity187 government would introduce ' comprehensive ' legislation to ensure there is no ' safe space ' for terrorists to communicate over the internet			0
the prime minister said security and intelligence agencies need ' robust powers ' to protect the public from violent extremists			0
mr @entity183 had already indicated he would seek to revive measures in the abandoned draft communications data bill - dubbed the ' snoopers ' charter ' by critics - enabling the agencies to track emails and other online communications			2
deputy prime minister @entity158 is blocking the bill - insisting it gives the security services too much power to snoop on the public			0
@entity0 , who was a computer specialist at an intelligence centre in @entity214 , tricked colleagues into handing over passwords so he could copy up to 1.7million files in one of the biggest leaks in @entity222 history			0
the defence contractor claims he had to act because the @entity222 government ’s policies were a ‘ threat to democracy ’			2
he fled to @entity228 , then @entity229 , where he was granted asylum and now lives in a secret location			0
speaking at the @entity234 launch of the @entity235 , an international survey of public trust in institutions , sir @entity8 said : ' we have seen a trend over the last few years of the threat rising , the formal threat level has gone up which says that a terrorist attack is highly likely			1
' that is not saying an attempted terrorist attack is highly likely			0
it is saying a terrorist attack getting through is highly likely and we have to take those words at face value			0
' he also backed the prime minister ’s assertion last week that there can not be ‘ no - go areas ’ online or in other types of communications			1
he added : ' the prime minister must have been right when he was saying last week that you can not afford to have complete no - go areas			2
' we can not have no - go areas in our communities where the police can not go , because that just allows space room for the evil doers to ply their trades			2
it is the same in the virtual world			0
' if you allow areas which are completely impenetrable , then , okay , you might feel comfortable that your communications are private and no one else can see them , but so are those who are trying to do you down and undermine your society			0
' but the warning will be seen as a direct rebuke to the deputy prime minister @entity158 who is blocking proposals to give @entity64 's spooks the power to monitor what people browse on the internet and who they are emailing .			0

sir @entity8 said a terrorist atrocity was now certain to ' get through '
comes as terror group posted @entity11 video based on @entity16 officer 's leaks
it shows fanatics how to avoid detection by ‘ @entity75 secret spying technology ’
sir @entity8 said tech companies were more *hesitant* to work with agencies
fears this has created ‘ no - go areas ’ where terrorists can plot undetected
