nine small earthquakes rattled @entity1 just hours apart on tuesday , though no damage has so far been reported from the temblors			1
the magnitudes of the earthquakes , which began around 7.30am , ranged from 1.6 to 3.6 , according to the @entity6			0
earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 are generally the smallest people can feel			0
the @entity11 @entity10 plotted the epicenters of the first four quakes to northeast @entity14 , a @entity15 suburb			1
at least two of those could be felt throughout the @entity15 - @entity19 area			1
seismologists also installed a new earthquake - monitoring device in @entity14 this week , after minor temblors rocked an area which is near the site of the former @entity26 football stadium			1
another at about 7 p.m. measured 3.6 , while tremors at 8:11 p.m. and 8:12 p.m. measured less than 3.0			0
the first four happened within an area near the @entity35 that 's seen a swarm of mild temblors in recent months			2
@entity6 geophysicist @entity38 says tuesday 's quakes were the ' largest since the earthquakes started happening there in the last year			2
' according to @entity43 , a 1.7 earthquake took place close to a @entity15 intersection at 9:54pm , and a 2.4 earthquake hit @entity14 's @entity48 campus at 10:05pm			1
a 1.6 earthquake struck at 11:02pm - and like many of the other quakes , was also in the vicinity of the @entity35 , the affiliate station reported			1
@entity54 , a geophysicist with the @entity6 in @entity55 , @entity56 , said senior scientists would be investigating the temblors			0
' they will be looking at the parameters , magnitude , depth , location of each of the events , ' @entity54 said wednesday			0
' right now we 're calling it a swarm , because we 've had multitude events happen			0
' the seismic series has left residents on edge , wondering if the situation will get worse and what has been behind an uptick in quakes over the last several years			0
' the safety and security of our residents is paramount for the city of @entity14 , ' said @entity14 city manager @entity81			2
some residents believe the implosion of @entity84 in 2010 may have exacerbated problems			0
there is also speculation the quakes might be related to hydraulic fracturing , or ' fracking , ' an energy extraction technique that has a long history in north @entity1			2
trouble : some residents believe the implosion of @entity84 in 2010 may have exacerbated problems with earthquakes in the area @entity14 , headquarters of @entity101 's @entity100 unit that helped pioneer hydraulic fracturing in the region , has two gas wells that were fracked in 2010 , according to city officials			1
the @entity14 area , with a population topping 250,000 , has had more than 25 minor earthquakes since early september , according to @entity109 , a seismologist with @entity110			1
' @entity110 's seismology team is committed to helping @entity112 understand more about the increasing number of earthquakes felt in our region over the last few years , most recently near the city of @entity14 , ' @entity109 said in a statement tuesday			1
@entity110 researchers installed a seismometer in @entity14 on monday			2
other devices were set up earlier near @entity122 and on the @entity15 campus			2
the study is aimed at pinpointing the quakes ' epicenters , @entity109 said			0
about 40 miles west of @entity14 , a series of small earthquakes rattled the town of @entity130 a year ago , causing sinkholes and cracks in house foundations			1
residents blamed fracking and injection disposal wells for drilling waste as the cause but an official finding is still pending			0
energy industry officials have said fracking is safe and causes no significant seismic damage .			0
