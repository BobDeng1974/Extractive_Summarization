a tweet from @entity6 newspaper @entity16 , showing the advert - which includes the stipulation ' if possible , no jews ' in a statement on its website , @entity9 revealed it had filed a complaint with @entity10 ' prosecutor , saying it ' strongly condemned ' the anti-semitic sentiment in the advert , which also asked for applicants to be motivated , well - organised and with three to four years experience			1
