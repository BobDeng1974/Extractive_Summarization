@entity9 wanted to come up with a gruelling way of testing out its new eco-friendly prototype , so set drivers the challenge of completing the epic trip from @entity15 in the @entity16 to @entity17			2
the trail saw the cars traversing 13 countries along the way , encountering miles of mud and gravel tracks on the route which was designed to connect @entity25 to @entity26 for trading over 2,000 years ago			1
the new @entity29 prototypes take on the 10,500 - mile journey from @entity7 to @entity8 , travelling through 13 different countries along the way the team of three @entity4 hybrids and four support cars travelled through 13 countries on the route which was designed to connect @entity25 to @entity26 for trading over 2,000 years ago the team took 53 days to complete the journey which saw them encounter temperatures of up to @entity42 and dangerously high altitudes cattle grids , river passings and mountain - edge trails were some of the challenges drivers faced throughout the trip which took 53 days to complete			1
the convoy of three @entity4 and four support cars , drove through @entity26 before travelling through @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and finally @entity8			1
for seven consecutive days , the team drove at altitudes between 11,000 and 17,648 feet - a location where air is reduced significantly - making it more difficult for humans and combustion engines			1
but the @entity4 prototypes , which have a 3 - litre diesel engine as well as an electric motor , battled through the difficult conditions and averaged around 37mpg			1
the new hybrid powertrain features three driver - selectable modes and combines @entity9 ¿ s 3 - litre @entity71 diesel engine with a 35kw electric motor the hybrid coped well with mud and gravel trails thrown its way as well as other conditions which were deemed ' impassable ' for other cars for seven consecutive days , the team drove at altitudes between 11,000 and 17,648 feet - a location where air is reduced significantly - making it more difficult for humans and combustion engines in electric mode , the hybrid off - roader can travel at speeds of up to 30mph for one mile before the diesel engine kicks in a total of 15 punctures were suffered en route while four wheels were damaged by deep potholes , and four windscreens cracked by stones thrown - up on loose surfaces			1
the hybrid powertrain features three driver - selectable modes and combines @entity9 ’s 3 - litre @entity71 diesel engine with a 35kw electric motor integrated with the 8 - speed @entity103 automatic transmission			1
emissions are slashed by 26 per cent and the hybrids are capable of around 44mpg , with the hybrid system weighing less than 120kg			1
in electric mode , the hybrid off - roader can travel at speeds of up to 30mph for one mile before the diesel engine kicks in			1
the hybrid model , which will be on @entity113 roads next year , was unveiled in august as the car giant looks to increase sales which continue to impress			1
@entity116 announced last week it had its best ever september performance , selling 43,181 vehicles - up 17 per cent			2
in 2012 , @entity116 sold 357,773 vehicles , up 30 per cent			0

' in developing the hybrid - powered @entity4 , our objective was to gain hybrid ’s fuel economy and carbon emissions advantages without compromising the @entity4 ’s go - anywhere capabilities , its cabin space or its refinement			2
' the success of this remarkable expedition clearly demonstrates we have achieved that			0
' two adventurers today set a new world record by driving from @entity177 to @entity178 in just ten days			0
@entity179 , 58 , and @entity180 , 53 , made the 10,000 - mile journey in a @entity113 - built @entity182 , setting off at 5am on october 4			1

here , they are pictured crossing the border into @entity190 from @entity189 largely unmodified : the vehicle was driven almost 24 hours a day on the epic drive and suffered just one problem when the brake light came on after hitting a bump the former rally drivers arrived at the @entity209 in the @entity211 capital at 9.15am local time ( 8.15am bst ) today			0
mr @entity179 , from @entity213 , @entity214 , and mr @entity180 , from @entity215 , @entity216 , did the journey in ten days , three hours and 16 minutes			2
the duo , driving a 2005 @entity182 , powered by a 2.7 @entity220 diesel engine , smashed the record set earlier this year by more than ten hours			1
as they passed through @entity224 , they endured thunderstorms , tense border crossings , giant potholes and a dangerously low fuel tank			0
the largely - unmodified vehicle was driven almost 24 hours a day and suffered just one problem when the brake light came on after hitting a bump			0

mr @entity179 said : ‘ what a journey			0
we 're exhausted but absolutely elated to have broken the record and to have done it so safely and smoothly - if you do n't count the hundreds of miles of potholes through @entity246 that is			0
‘ despite the complexities of crossing so many borders we had relatively easy passage through each country and the friendly faces along the way made it all so worthwhile			0
‘ after seeing changing scenery like we have over the last ten days , and sometimes going hours without seeing another vehicle , i think we will both struggle returning to the morning commute			0
’ the duo join a small group of automotive adventurers who have set new records for the @entity177 - @entity178 journey over the last eight decades			2
the first attempt at the drive from @entity177 to @entity178 was undertaken 80 years ago in 1933 in a @entity268 convertible driven by @entity113 @entity269 and @entity270			2
the pair took a whopping 158 days to navigate a 13,000 - mile route , which started in @entity273 and included a treacherous @entity275 crossing			1
subsequent attempts at setting new records have been achieved on the 30th , 50th and 80th anniversaries of that first run			0
the former record for the journey was set earlier this year in february by @entity281 and @entity282 in an 875cc @entity283 , driving from @entity178 to @entity177			2
it took them ten days , 13 hours and 28 minutes			2
transported : their attempt was sponsored by @entity234			0
their vehicle is pictured left on a ferry on @entity291 , crossing from @entity189 to @entity190 teamwork : they passed through @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 en route to @entity211			0

the new hybrid 4x4s took 53 days to travel from @entity7 to @entity8 on the 10,472 - mile journey
drivers faced high altitudes and dangerous road conditions along the journey which traverses 13 countries
the diesel - engine system weighs less than 120kg and can reach up to 44mpg
the new models were unveiled in august and will be released to @entity113 markets next year
