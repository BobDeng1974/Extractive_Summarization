she is officially the fastest woman in the world on two wheels - and smashed the record using a machine she built herself			1
@entity6 and her home - built electric motorcycle ' @entity5 ' this week smashed several records at @entity10			1
with a top speed of 241.901 mph ( 389.219 km / h ) and a two - way average of 240.726 mph ( 387.328 km / h ) , she beat the previous electric motorcycle speed record by 25 mph - becoming the world 's fastest female on a motorcycle in the process			1
brakes : disc brakes front and back			0
two @entity42 ribbon brake parachutes , actuated by @entity44 air cylinders			0
body : fiberglass composite nosecone , canopy , and sidecar wheel cover in addition to being a new electric motorcycle record , the speed is also an overall new record for any kind of sidecar motorcycle , including internal combustion - powered sidecar motorcycles			1
' this is a truly historic event , ' @entity6 said			2
' it is the first time in over a century that an electric vehicle beats internal combustion for a vehicle type			0
the 33 year old is a phd student in mechanical engineering at the @entity65 for @entity67 / @entity66 and structures at @entity69			0
she said @entity5 is a ' very expensive hobby project ' with her husband @entity72 , a research scientist at the @entity73			2
although the design is a team work involving family and friends , @entity6 has manufactured about 80 % of the vehicle herself in their two - car garage			1
it has taken 5 years to build the @entity5 on a shoe - string budget			2
the pair said they define themselves as ' backyard racers with high - level engineering skills '			0
how it works : it has taken 5 years to build the @entity5 on a shoe - string budget			2
' the last time this happened was in 1899 when the world 's fastest car was the electric car ' @entity96 ' driven by @entity97 at 65 mph , ' said @entity6			1
' since then , internal combustion has dominated everything			0
' the record runs at the @entity101 on august 28 2014 give @entity6 and @entity5 the titles			1
the pair say they owe much of their success to ' doing the math ' to calculate exactly what will work best , instead of relying on luck , intuition or anecdotal information to find the optimal solution			0
' although the @entity5 is a fun hobby project , its real purpose is to be eco-activism in disguise , ' they claim			0
' the main purpose of this 19 ft. , 400 @entity32 , sleek , sexy motorcycle is to show that eco-friendly does n't mean slow and boring			0
' @entity6 is also on a mission to encourage girls and women to pursue a career in science and engineering			0
the sidecar is n't their first project - the pair also created the @entity72 , is the quickest electric motorcycle in the world			1
it has over 500 @entity32 and accelerates 0 - 60 mph ( 0 - 96 km / h ) in less than one second			0
born in @entity134 , motorcycle racing is in @entity6 's blood			1
with the help of her father , @entity137 , @entity6 built @entity134 's first street - legal electric motorcycle @entity138			1
@entity5 entering the measured mile at 240 mph			2
the speed is also an overall new record for any kind of sidecar motorcycles , including internal combustion - powered sidecar motorcycles			2
@entity6 and @entity5 with the 10 kw biodiesel - powered @entity148 generator used to recharge the @entity5 in the background			1
the pair sais they wanted to recharge the batteries using solar power , but could n't afford the panels needed .			0

@entity6 and her home - built electric motorcycle ' @entity5 ' smashed several records at @entity10
