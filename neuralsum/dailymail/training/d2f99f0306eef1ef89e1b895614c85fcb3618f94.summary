by @entity0 for fans of sci - fi films , it may look strangely familiar			2
@entity5 car firm @entity4 has unveiled its first ever motorcycle - and looks a lot like the famous @entity9 cycle from the film @entity10			1
in fact , @entity4 worked with the designer of the @entity10 bike on the project			1
the @entity15 is the first @entity4 motorcycle - although the car firm will let someone else produce it the @entity17 will be available in a range of special @entity4 colour schemes , and customers lucky enough to buy them can even design their own @entity4 has not yet revealed the top speed or the price of the bike			1

however , @entity4 will not be making the bike itself , instead granting @entity45 firm @entity35 a license to produce it			2
' the @entity17 combines ample power via a v - twin engine with a distinctive body designed by @entity50 integrating carbon fibre , titanium and aerospace quality steel , ' the firm said			2
just 100 of the bikes will be made in a range of special designs reflecting the most iconic @entity4 colour schemes , and customers can even design their own			1
the @entity17 was designed by @entity50 , who also designed the @entity59 production of the bike has already begun - even though @entity4 has not yet revealed how much it will cost designer @entity50 also worked with @entity62 to design the @entity9 cycle in the hit film			1

the @entity45 is also responsible for the black and gold livery of the @entity75 sports cars			0
' the design process of the @entity78 was a labour of love , there were many challenges , ensuring that the bike not only touches your visual senses with its timeless blend of classic appeal and modern execution , but that is safe and ergonomically sound was critical to me , ' he said			0
' we have worked hard to create a motorcycle with very distinctive features such as a clean main body , an extremely low side profile , a bold stance , a unique air intake , logical partline solutions and clean graphics			2
' the original idea to create the @entity17 came from @entity35 ’s dr @entity101			0
speaking about the project he said : ' we set out to create a bike that is n’t just great to ride but also represents a piece of art in motion			0
ust 100 of the bikes will be made in a range of special designs the bike was designed to be ' truly jaw dropping ' ' over the years i have seen my fair share of style over substance , what this bike brings to the market is a unique combination of both : state of the art technology with a truly jaw - dropping aesthetic			1
' @entity122 , ceo of @entity123 said : ' i was one of the first people to ride it and i have to say i was very impressed			0
