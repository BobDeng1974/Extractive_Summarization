the playoff contenders did not make it easy on the committee chairman @entity50 and his colleagues on the panel by all winning on saturday			0
the committee has been ranking the top 25 weekly since late october 's rankings and last week had @entity0 and @entity1 at the top , followed by @entity39 and @entity2			1
the committee ranks teams differently than traditional college football polls , such as the @entity61			0

the great debate for weeks was whether @entity39 or @entity38 would make it into the final four			0
the @entity74 beat their @entity37 rivals 61 - 58 in @entity76 back in october , but from the start the committee ranked @entity39 ahead of the @entity74 , who lost at @entity79 by 14 and played a particularly weak nonconference schedule			2
for weeks , @entity50 said that the difference between the @entity74 and @entity82 was not close enough for it to come down to the head - to - head result			0
but when the season concluded the teams had played 10 common opponents			0
the @entity37 further muddled the issue by not designating a champion by a @entity74 and @entity82 both got a trophy and are called co-champions			0
@entity3 has come from the farthest during the season , overcoming an early loss to @entity93 to make a strong run			2
the @entity96 final statement was a doozy : 59 - 0 against @entity98 in the @entity100 championship game saturday			1

the defending national champions are the only undefeated team in @entity109			0
but numerous close calls and comebacks have led the committee to drop the @entity106 in the rankings			0
ultimately , though , the ' noles will get to defend their championship in the first playoff			0
@entity3 wide receiver @entity117 celebrates saturday after a huge 59 - 0 victory against @entity98			2
