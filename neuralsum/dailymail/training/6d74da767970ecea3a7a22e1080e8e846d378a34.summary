' we do not know where or when [ the speech will be )			0

’ asked if @entity3 should stay in the @entity2 , he replied : ‘ of course			1
we think it is important that there is @entity3 the @entity2			2
' we have done some common activities about stimulating growth , freed trade … we have a common stand in those issue but of course there are also many differences			0
’ @entity114 @entity113 said the strident @entity115 gave the impression of a @entity3 that was ‘ snarling like a pitbull across the channel ’			2
he said @entity3 was ‘ making ourselves look pretty darned unattractive ’ as a partner in the @entity2			2
discussing mr @entity27 ’s ambition to claw back powers from @entity9 , he said an ‘ evolutionary solution ’ was the way to proceed , rather than the ‘ nuclear option ’ of quitting the @entity2			1

mr @entity36 , in a speech at @entity137 , @entity138 , made it clear the @entity36 would resist any attempt to have a major renegotiation of @entity3 ’s membership of the @entity2			1
the chancellor ’s comments came in an interview on tuesday , but were only published yesterday			0
in the intervening period , both the @entity146 and @entity24 have warned @entity3 against holding a referendum on @entity30			1
on wednesday , @entity146 assistant secretary for @entity30 affairs @entity149 said the @entity152 administration wanted ‘ a strong @entity3 voice ’ in the @entity2 and warned that referendums risked turning countries ‘ inward ’			1

@entity3 is on the brink of an unprecedented triple - dip recession after experts suggested that the economy had gone into reverse at the end of last year			0
it shrank by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2012 , according to the think - tank @entity186 ( @entity186 )			0
another three months of decline at the start of 2013 – seen as a serious threat given forecasts of freezing weather and heavy snow – would result in a third recession in five years			0
a recession is defined as two or more quarters of decline in a row			0
‘ a triple - dip recession remains a possibility , ’ said @entity199 , an economist at @entity201 firm @entity200 is trapped in the longest downturn on record and the economy is still 3.4 per cent smaller than it was at its peak in 2008 when boom gave way to bust			0
‘ we do not expect output to pass its peak of early 2008 until 2014 , ’ said @entity210 , an economist at @entity186			0
that would mean a six - year slump in the wake of the meltdown of the banking system in 2008			0
