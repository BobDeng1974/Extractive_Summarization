start racing along at more than three times the speed limit and you might expect the police to come after you			1
what you might not expect is to get anywhere near to three times the speed limit when pedalling through the park on two wheels			1
but that ’s exactly what happened to @entity9 star @entity10 , who was confronted by police armed with speed guns as he cycled in @entity13 yesterday			1
a camera on the @entity26 presenter ’s helmet captured the moment that officers stopped him and showed him the reading on their speed gun			1
@entity10 , 49 , was apologetic – but suggested that such a low speed limit puts cyclists in danger by forcing them on to roads , where they can ride faster but are far more at risk of an accident			1
he also complained the rule is not clearly signposted			0
the policeman is one of a group of officers in the busy park , suggesting the action was part of a clampdown the star , who also presents @entity48 and @entity49 , shared his video of the incident with his 260,000 followers on @entity53			2
his @entity9 colleague @entity54 quickly branded him ‘ @entity55 ’ and other social media users poked fun at police , questioning whether resources were being wasted and pointing out that 5mph is not all that much faster than the average walking speed			1
one @entity53 user jokingly asked : ‘ are the police radar - gunning joggers as well ? ’ but there was also an angry backlash from pedestrians who accused @entity10 of behaving in a ‘ dangerous ’ way , and cited examples of cyclists whizzing past at great speed and almost knocking them over			1
radio 2 presenter @entity10 was stopped in @entity13 today for cycling at 16mph in a 5mph zone one user wrote : ‘ why should people have to dodge cycles going at three times walking pace so cycles do n’t have to dodge traffic at two times cycle pace			1
hypocritical ? ’ on his lunchtime radio show just hours after the incident , father - of - two @entity10 joked he was ‘ off to practice cycling at 5mph ’ and added : ‘ i have n’t seen a radar gun for a long time so did n’t expect one with the digit 16 on it			1
‘ i feel embarrassed and i apologise			0
i did n’t see any signs			0
i certainly will be cycling as slow as walking pace in future			0
’ earlier this year , @entity10 said that each morning his wife ‘ says farewell in the manner of @entity96 women who waved off pilot husbands in @entity98 ’ due to the danger associated with cycling in @entity22			2
@entity101 of the @entity102 backed @entity10 , saying : ‘ clearly it ’s important for cyclists to behave considerately around pedestrians in parks , just as it is for motorists to behave considerately around cyclists on the roads – but a 5mph speed limit is almost walking pace			1
‘ we ’d urge the @entity21 to review the speed limit and raise it to something more in line with the average cyclist ’s speed			1
’ a spokesman for the @entity120 said the officers were in the park as part of an ‘ awareness operation ’ , during which ‘ hundreds ’ of cyclists were issued with advice and leaflets explaining the law			2
a spokesman for @entity21 added : ‘ this was n’t enforcement action and no penalty notices were issued – it was a gentle reminder of the need to be considerate to others			0
’ the latest incident comes after mr @entity10 was criticised online for posting a helmet camera video of a mother crossing the road with a pram			2
in one of the many cycling films he has posted on @entity53 , he put up a video of a mother with two children crossing the road in front of him , along with the angry message : ' watch the pram '			0
but his followers hit back , suggesting the woman had the right of way as she had already started to cross when he turned onto the road			0
linking to the @entity158 , one website user wrote : ' heads up : she had right of way , rule 170			0
' it was the latest tweet by the star in which he expressed anger at conditions for cyclists in the capital			0
earlier this month , he responded to criticism for plans for cycle ' superhighways ' , by tweeting : ' oh sorry			0
apparently allowing cyclists to move around the capital without dying will " slow drivers down "			0
' he also tweeted a video he made of a taxi driving in front of him and added : ' next time a taxi driver complains about “ cyclists on the pavement , ” i ’ll politely show him this			0
' mr @entity10 has also sent out messages calling for a change to ' @entity185 ' signs on the sides of lorries .			2
