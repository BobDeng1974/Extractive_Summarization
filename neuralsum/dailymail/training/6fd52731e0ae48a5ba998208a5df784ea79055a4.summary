somewhere in this performance was a message from @entity3 and this @entity5 team			1
it was defiant and even dizzying at times			0
in a week when just about every bad statistic going has been used to bash @entity3 around the head , @entity5 are @entity9 semi-finalists			1
this performance , played at breakneck speed and designed to blow @entity13 ’s tactical strategy into the @entity14 , was a reminder that @entity5 can still put teams away			2
it is the least they deserve			0
soon enough they will be under the spotlight again , but this was a gutsy display and at least temporarily lifted the gloom that has enveloped this club			0
they were 3 - 0 up , thanks to the two goals dutifully put away by @entity19 and the sweetest cushioned volley by @entity65 , before @entity21 really knew what had happened to them			1
they are @entity101 leaders for a reason , but @entity3 and his team had ripped them apart here before @entity42 got on the scoresheet with a fortunate goal			1
@entity57 ’ clumsy mistake provoked inevitable scrutiny over the decision to promote the @entity110 over @entity73 , but that was not the story of @entity113			0
instead it is the powers of recovery of those in yellow , the ability to put the 3 - 0 savaging at @entity121 behind them to run out convincing winners here			2
take @entity62 , for example			0
here he had presence , was full of purpose in his running and looked something like his old self again alongside @entity64 and @entity32			0
@entity5 were superior in every department , working over this aspirational south - coast side with a ruthless blend of finishing and determination			1
there were a staggering 51 passes in the build up to @entity19 ’s opener , a head - turning move that left @entity21 ’s defence utterly bewildered			1
such was the speed it was hard to keep up , but eventually @entity65 swung a cross in from the left for @entity32 to head back across @entity25 ’s goal			1
this time @entity19 , who was denied three times by @entity148 keeper @entity147 in sunday ’s defeat , applied the finishing touch with a deft header			1
that was a team move , the ethos that @entity3 has been trying to promote at @entity84 during a wretched run that has already brought them seven league defeats			0
what a lesson for @entity13 , the young @entity21 manager in charge of a team that put eight past @entity160 at @entity161 ’s earlier in the season and scored five in their victory over @entity165 last saturday			0
summer signing @entity65 sweeps the ball into the bottom corner of @entity25 's net to make it to 2 - 0 to @entity5 @entity65 's well - placed effort nestles into the bottom corner as @entity25 , on loan from @entity174 , looks on helplessly @entity5 's players celebrate with @entity65 as @entity21 's players trudge back up the pitch to take kick - off @entity19 weaves his way through @entity21 's defence on his way to scoring his second goal of the night former @entity183 youngster @entity19 unleashes a low shot to give @entity5 a comfortable three - goal lead early in the second half @entity187 forward @entity19 runs off to celebrate giving @entity5 a 3 - 0 lead against their @entity101 opponents @entity19 finished off a stunning 51 - pass move to give @entity5 the lead against @entity21 - click here for more in our @entity193 @entity47 knows he should have put @entity21 ahead , tricking his way into the @entity5 area in the opening minutes before he rolled his effort well wide @entity57 ’ post			1
after that , this @entity21 team simply invited @entity5 to put pressure on them in every area of this rain - soaked playing surface			1
@entity40 , @entity203 , @entity45 and @entity41 did some decent things in patches , but this game was played by @entity5 at full pelt			2
it seemed as though they had scores to settle			0
there was a whiff of controversy about the second because some dopey fool in the @entity21 crowd who blew a whistle , causing captain @entity38 to check his defensive run when @entity66 was about to shoot			0
from the rebound @entity65 was perfectly placed just inside the penalty area to cushion a side volley into the net			2
@entity3 is persisting with this three - man defence			0
he is short of a controlling influence in there , but they have plenty of muscle with @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 protecting @entity57			0
they eased off occasionally , allowing @entity230 the chance to pull a goal back for @entity21 immediately after @entity65 ’s strike			2
he missed and you felt then that this would not be one of those famous midweek @entity9 nights			2
@entity21 midfielder @entity42 scores his side 's only goal of the night after a brave run into @entity5 's penalty area former @entity241 youngster @entity42 watches his effort beat @entity5 goalkeeper @entity57 and hit the back of the net @entity21 striker @entity47 skips through @entity5 's out - of - form defence early on in the first half former @entity247 forward @entity47 reacts after missing a good opportunity to give his side the lead against @entity5 @entity5 captain @entity62 has his shirt tugged by @entity21 's @entity43 during a lively opening period there was no let up from @entity5			1
they operated at a different level and whenever @entity21 ’s defence drifted off , @entity19 was there to take advantage			2
he scored his second in the 51st minute , rinsing @entity38 inside the penalty area before his cute touch lost @entity25 at the far post			0
there was a brief moment when this raucous crowd could finally get on their feet , roaring their approval when @entity42 , a former @entity241 midfielder , pulled a goal back for @entity21			1
it was an error of judgment by @entity57 , the man entrusted with the gloves after @entity3 revealed on sunday that he would be first choice for the foreseeable future			0
even after @entity42 hit the post with another chance , there was the sense that not even @entity5 could throw this away			1
reaching a semi-final of the @entity9 , particularly after last tuesday ’s ignominious exit from the @entity280 , feels like progress			2
remarkably , a season of transition could still end with a trophy			0
@entity21 defender @entity39 ( left ) connects with a header under pressure from @entity5 's @entity59 @entity19 somehow misses a chance to complete his hat - trick after a smart flick from team - mate @entity67 midfield duo @entity43 ( left ) and @entity66 tussle for the ball under the floodlights at the @entity113 @entity21 boss @entity13 ( right ) greets @entity5 manager @entity3 ahead of kick - off on wednesday night video we showed character to progress - @entity3			1

@entity19 rounded off a *brilliant* 51 - pass move to give @entity5 the lead after 20 minutes
@entity65 *doubled* the @entity302 ' lead with a fine finish seven minutes after @entity19 's header
@entity19 *grabbed* his second goal of the night after 51 minutes after *latching* onto a ball from @entity67
former @entity241 midfielder @entity42 scored a solo effort for the @entity101 side on 57 minutes
@entity5 will face @entity313 in the semi-finals of the @entity9
