@entity1 boss @entity0 is confident there is much more to come from his new boys as he attempts to convince dissenting supporters this new season can yet be one of promise			1
it was one of @entity0 's longer - serving players who came to the rescue in his hour of need on saturday when @entity13 climbed from the bench for the first time since april and dragged the manager back from the point of no return in the eyes of his critics to snatch a 2 - 2 @entity21 draw with @entity22			1
@entity23 , a £ 7million summer signing from @entity24 , has yet to score for @entity1 on wednesday night , the 53 - year - old and his players will turn their attention to the @entity28 and a third round trip to @entity30 in a game which will give them some respite from the battle to lift the club from the foot of the league table			1
just what team @entity0 selects remains to be seen with the men above him having made it clear that it is the @entity21 , and not the domestic cup competitions , which is the priority , but if £ 7million summer signing @entity23 is involved , his manager will hope he builds upon his most encouraging display yet against @entity22			1
@entity0 said : ' i was really pleased with @entity23			0
he 's such an important player for us with @entity48 ] out , and i do n't think up until now he has really produced a performance which warrants his tag , the money we have spent			0
@entity53 has also found the transition to the @entity21 difficult ' but i really felt he showed the character , he showed the quality that really buoyed me , if i am honest , that has buoyed me a little bit going into the next game			2
' former @entity24 midfielder @entity23 , 24 , was one of nine men to join the @entity60 during the close season with @entity62 and @entity63 immediately being loaned back to @entity64			0
he , like @entity65 striker @entity53 , has been thrown straight in at the deep end and the pair have found the transition to @entity21 challenging to say the least			2
@entity1 protest group ' @entity68 ' have parodied owner @entity71 's @entity70 logo @entity1 's lack of senior frontmen has seen @entity53 start all six games to date and with little support , he is still awaiting his first competitive goal for the club			1
however , @entity0 is hopeful that @entity13 's return from injury will help to take the weight off the 24 - year - old @entity81			2
he said : ' i feel some sympathy for @entity84 because he has had to carry the shirt and he 's not ready to carry that shirt yet full - time			0
' it 's a shirt that is heavy and i think he has seen an example from @entity13 to take that chance to make that little movement in the box			0
@entity1 travel to @entity30 in the third round of the @entity28 on wednesday night ' @entity84 will learn from that , and it gives me the opportunity with @entity13 coming back to fitness to rest @entity84 and for him to understand what it is to play at a big club like this			1
' he 's only 24 , @entity53 , and really and truly , we have had too much responsibility on him			0
' @entity0 has the advantage of his side not playing again in the league until they head for @entity107 next monday evening , although he is likely to make several changes for the game at @entity110 and having admitted @entity13 should not really have played at the weekend , he has a decision to make over whether or not to use him this time around			0
it will be the second time the sides have met already this season with substitute @entity116 's injury - time strike at @entity117 on august 30 securing a point for @entity120 's men from a game in which they had twice led before going 3 - 2 down with normal time almost up .			2

both @entity53 and @entity23 have found it hard *adjusting* to life in the @entity21
@entity1 had to rely on @entity13 in saturday 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity22
@entity0 's *job* is in *danger* after just five games of the season gone
his side travel to @entity30 in the @entity28 on wednesday
