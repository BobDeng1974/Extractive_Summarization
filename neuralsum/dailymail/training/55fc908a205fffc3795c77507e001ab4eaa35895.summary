the quality of the finishing we have seen before			0
from @entity4 it has become what we expect			1
but what was utterly remarkable about his performance here in @entity10 was the fact that he was even on the pitch when he scored what proved a quite brilliant winner for @entity16			1
in the end he left the field with cramp , and understandably so only 28 days after undergoing surgery on an injured knee			1
but not before accelerating away from a static , stuttering @entity23 defence in the 85th minute of this @entity25 encounter – 85 minutes for heaven ’s sake – and pushing @entity29 ’s side perilously close to elimination from the competition			1
half 19 1 chances created 2 0 tackles won 0 24 balls lost 18 this , of course , was a night when @entity23 wished for something similar from @entity41 , and when he levelled the score to cancel out @entity4 ’s first - half strike it seemed he had at last made an impact			1
in his 10th game at his third @entity25 , the player who promised so much when he first burst onto the international stage at @entity82 had scored a @entity25 goal			1
a heavy burden of expectation there was a reason why @entity55 extended an arm across @entity41 ’s shoulders in the tunnel moments before kick - off and whispered into his ear			1
@entity23 ’s captain knew how important an encounter this was for his international colleague			2
just as he knew it was time for @entity23 ’s talismanic striker to finally put that considerable talent to use on the greatest stage of all			1
@entity16 were looking to @entity4 to provide much the same inspiration after their opening defeat to @entity104 , so the burden of expectation was heavy on both these players on a night when defeat would leave their respective teams in a most precarious position			1
@entity111 man : the @entity16 players congratulate the forward , who had just returned from injury beaten : @entity115 did n't have a chance in the @entity23 goal , with the ball finding the bottom corner dejected : @entity41 , @entity120 and @entity55 watch on after the opener central roles @entity41 was selected , as expected , in that number 10 role he prefers			1
if he was a peripheral figure on the left flank against @entity127 , here was an opportunity to stamp his authority on the tournament			0
in fairness to @entity41 , he was far from @entity23 ’s worst player and only @entity55 covered more ground than the @entity137 forward			1
in total @entity41 ran 10.36km			2
he also went close on two other occasions and created an excellent chance for @entity120			0
but you have to wonder if switching @entity41 with @entity142 was the right move when the youngster was so impressive against @entity127			2
here , on the right , he created not once chance before being hooked by @entity29			0
and @entity23 lacked the drive and ambition they had with @entity142 in the central role			2
in truth @entity41 might have devoted too much energy running into areas away from the zone where he needed to be most effective ; between @entity120 and the midfield			2
he planted himself between @entity23 ’s centre - halves and punished them			2
quite simply , the man did his job			0
quality of the opposition if @entity41 took encouragement from @entity16 ’s defensive display against @entity104 , the changes @entity165 was forced to make because of injury and suspension perhaps would have given him further cause for optimism			1
there was @entity173 at left back ; once of @entity174 and @entity175 but now at @entity10			0
but more significantly there was @entity177 , a 19 - year - old centre - half with only one league appearance for @entity180 after signing for a million euros last year			0
he was certainly nowhere to be seen when @entity41 arrived , unopposed , to meet @entity182 ’s ball for @entity23 ’s equaliser			1
but @entity4 must have fancied his chances as well against defenders he knows only too well			2
they also looked fragile in their opening game here in @entity189 and he embarrassed @entity48 much as @entity190 did @entity191			0
as @entity197 observed , ‘ if the centre - forward can see the number on your back you are in trouble ’			0
a brief add to that : if a centre - forward is allowed to seize on a long ball and score unchallenged , the entire defence has failed in its principal task			0
never mind the quality of the finish			0
that was shocking defending from @entity23			2
fitness concern : but @entity4 was full of running on his return from injury , troubling the @entity23 defence inches : @entity41 went close to opening the scoring with a curling free - kick early on not quite : the @entity137 striker thought his @entity25 goal would never come was fitness an issue ? @entity4 might have declared himself 100 per cent fit but , seriously , who was he kidding ? nobody returns at their best in the first game that kind of absence			1
what we saw though , in both the header he scored and the finish he produced , was the natural skill , agility and athleticism he possesses			0
not to mention that killer instinct			0
it ’s why he so outrageously outstanding			0
if there were fitness concerns about @entity41 prior to the tournament , and one still wonders how disciplined he was in getting himself ready for the @entity25 given his weakness for some of the finer things in life , he answered his critics here			1
opportunities squandered @entity4 wasted one particularly good chance in the 51st minute when he had a clear shot on @entity115 ’s goal			1
but let ’s just look at the statistics for a moment here			0
@entity4 has now scored 40 international goals in 78 appearances , 11 of those coming in qualifying for this @entity25			1
and the two he scored here came on a night when he was also taking @entity16 ’s free - kicks and corners			2
for @entity41 , he will reflect on this game with more frustration			1
he went mighty close to scoring twice in the first half , first with a free - kick that whistled just wide and then when meeting a @entity55 free - kick with a header that crashed against the crossbar			0
in the second half he also forced @entity261 to make a stunning close - range save			0
but that ’s still one goal from four chances , compared to a return of two from three for @entity4			1
says it all really , even if @entity41 also delivered one super ball for @entity120 shortly after @entity4 had scored			1
it was a defence - splitting ball that sent @entity120 into space , the @entity23 forward forcing @entity261 to make a decent save at his near post			2
wrong foot : @entity41 shot straight at the goalkeeper when he found space in the penalty area sitter : @entity41 missed a great chance from yards out after a fine cross from a free - kick agonising : the @entity23 striker had never scored a goal in a @entity25 , despite playing in three tournaments how did they carry themselves ? @entity4 might not have been fit but boy was he fired up			1
after sitting through that dreadful performance in @entity288 , he demanded higher standards from his colleagues			0
@entity291 certainly got an earful when he delayed delivery of a pass			0
@entity41 used to be like that too , but he seems less influential , less vocal , on the pitch these days			2
verdict it is in @entity299 that world class players shine , and if @entity41 could once claim to stand among the best those days appear to over			0
@entity4 proved that , essentially on one leg			0
hero : @entity4 may have been stretchered off ( below ) but he had done enough for the @entity304 @entity306 rivals : @entity50 team - mates @entity4 and @entity55 challenge for the ball in the air			0

@entity4 scores double to put @entity23 on the brink of elimination
@entity41 equalised earlier on for @entity23 with first @entity25 goal
@entity16 striker was playing first game after knee surgery
