by @entity0 published : 17:00 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 02:10 est , 2 august 2013 the weight of the world is currently resting heavily on @entity4 's shoulders			1
so it 's no wonder she looked puffy - eyed and much older than her 41 years as she emerged in @entity8 on wednesday			0
perhaps trying to detract from her weary appearance , the @entity12 star donned a garish purple outfit as she headed to the gym			0
the eyes give her away : @entity4 looked like she 'd endured a sleepless and likely tearful night as she hit the gym in @entity8 on wednesday with her hair pulled back and wearing next to no war paint , the mom - of - four stood out in her purple patterned three - quarter leggings , which she teamed with a near - matching purple t - shirt , black socks and white runners			0
later than evening , however , it was a perfectly coiffed @entity4 who attended the @entity27 in @entity28			2
her long dark hair in perfect curls and with her signature heavily kohl - rimmed eyes and nude lips , she did n't miss the chance to promote her @entity36 line			2
trying to distract us ? the @entity12 star donned a garish , eye - catching purple outfit - but all eyes were on her pained expression ' you ca n't stop living ' : photographer @entity41 revealed the star was ' in good spirits ' and ' did n't seem depressed at all ' as she attended the @entity27 in @entity28 on wednesday night the star put on a brave face at the event , pouring herself into a tight - fitting royal blue off - the - shoulder dress with strap detail around the neck			1
' you ca n't stop living , ' she rather cheerily said as she posed for photographer @entity41 - who noted that the star appeared to be ' in good spirits ' and ' did n't seem depressed at all ' as she chatted with guests , according to @entity54			1
just a day earlier , the @entity8 native and her husband of 15 years , @entity55 , made an appearance of a very different kind - at the @entity61 courthouse in @entity62 , @entity8 , after being charged with 39 counts of fraud			1
disheveled : an unshaven @entity65 was spotted on thursday outside his home in @entity67 , @entity8 for the first time since posting bail two days earlier the multitude of indictments included conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud , bank fraud , making false statements on loan applications and bankruptcy fraud			2
@entity65 is also charged with failing to file tax returns between 2004 and 2008 , during which time it is alleged he earned close to $ 1 million			1
the businessman also faces further charges in @entity83 , after obtaining a driver 's licence using his brother 's identity			0
a united front : @entity65 and @entity4 arrived hand - in - hand to their court hearing at the @entity92 in @entity62 , @entity8 , after being indicted on 39 charges of fraud the 43 - year - old rejected a plea deal through his lawyer , @entity97 , in april			1
neither husband nor wife entered a plea during tuesday 's brief court session and they were released on a combined $ 1 million unsecured bail bond			1
judge @entity104 did , however , order them to surrender their passports and restricted their travels to @entity8 and @entity28 amid fears of a ' great escape ' to @entity112			0
speaking to the masses of gathered reporters at the courthouse following the proceedings , @entity114 attorney @entity113 confirmed , ' we are confident we have enough evidence to convict the defendants beyond a reasonable doubt			1
' out on bail : the couple were charged with 39 counts of fraud and released on a combined $ 1 million bail following their brief court appearance in which neither entered a plea while @entity4 's attorney , @entity131 , says he believes the government is prosecuting the couple because of their celebrity , it seems he 's not the only one who thinks fame is playing a pivotal role in the proceedings			1
fellow reality tv star and former @entity28 real housewife @entity140 has given her unfiltered opinion on the situation			0
asked to comment on the developing saga while promoting her talk show , @entity147 , at the @entity148 in @entity149 on wednesday , the 42 - year - old said , ' my first thought today was , " oh , if they were n't on reality tv , none of this would probably ever be exposed			2
" ' further charges : @entity65 is also charged with failing to file tax returns between 2004 and 2008 , during which time it is alleged he earned close to $ 1 million she continued , ' it 's just funny how certain people are [ like a ] moth to a flame			1
it 's almost like , not that you want to get caught , but people who love to be in the spotlight often have a lot of skeletons in their closet			0
it 's just an interesting thing			0
' do i feel sorry for them ? no , i do n't , ' she stated honestly			2
' not so much , because it broke the law			0
you broke the law and you went on television			0
that 's not really that smart			0
' the mom - of - one did , however , express sympathy for the couple 's children - @entity182 , 12 , @entity185 , 10 , @entity186 , seven , and @entity187 , three - who have been caught up in the drama			0
no support here : former @entity191 star @entity140 said , ' do i feel sorry for them ? no , i do n't , ' when asked about the situation at wednesday 's @entity148 it 's certainly an unsettling time for the entire @entity4 family , with @entity4 and @entity65 now each facing up to 50 years in jail if convicted on all charges			2
meanwhile , @entity65 could also potentially be deported back to @entity112 after it was revealed during the hearing that despite having been married to his @entity114 wife for more than a decade , the family patriarch is not a @entity114 citizen			1
the @entity206 ' hearing is set for august 14 and , according to their attorneys , both will plead not guilty .			1
