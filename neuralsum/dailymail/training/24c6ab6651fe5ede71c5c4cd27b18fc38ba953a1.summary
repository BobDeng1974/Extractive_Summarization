by @entity0 @entity2 mothers , wives and sisters may not have served on the frontline , but they played a crucial role back home - often as they were dealing with the tragedy and grief of loved ones lost on the @entity12 battlefields			1
' @entity13 was unusual , close to unique , among combatants in the war in that women had the vote ' , historian and @entity20 researcher professor @entity19 told @entity21			2
the politicians at the time paid a great deal of attention to the women 's opinion as they had the potential to seriously influence the conscription laws , and many were against conscription all together			1
' the issue with gender and women featured more prominently in @entity13 's role in the war that it did in other countries			2
' 60,000 @entity2 lives were lost in battle , which meant one in ten men who was sent overseas never returned home			1
hundreds of thousands more came back as casualties of war , with serious physical and debilitating mental scars			0
' the [ initial ] rush to enlist was in light of they thought it would be a war that would be over so quickly			0
little did they know the battle would continue for years			0
in @entity13 because women had the vote they played a key role in deciding conscription laws , pictured here at a recruiting march the female population was divided on conscription , and some in favour took part in processions wives , mothers and sisters had a heavy burden taking on the roles of the men and living with the fear , and often horrific reality , of losing loved ones women are seen here packing chests full of donated items to send overseas the local press would report on the proceedings of the war , but their information was often delayed by days			1
ministers of religion were the ones burdened with delivering the news of a death of a soldier to his loved ones			0
@entity2 historian and widely - published intellect professor @entity19 told of the way gender played a key role for @entity2 women in @entity38 professor @entity19 told of the fear and heartbreak those mothers and wives experienced , always in wait for bad news			1
' if the minister or priest turned up in your street , there would be a sort of foreboding ' , he said			0
women would stand at the front of their houses , waiting , and praying that the letter was not coming their direction			0
back home , the @entity2 mothers and wives played a very different roles to their counterparts around the world			1
while it was common for women to assume different roles in absence of the men , @entity2 women had less opportunity to actively participate in the war			1
professor @entity19 revealed : ' there were many patriotic women who wanted to play a part but found it difficult to do so			0
' unlike in @entity154 where women had the chance to carry rifles , during @entity38 mothers and wives fell into ' comfort ' roles			2
they worked for charities in volunteer roles - collecting funds for soldier 's relief , and knitted socks and balaclavas to send to the troops			2
@entity172 biscuits and tobacco were also gifted to those fighting			0
as they did n't have the opportunity to actively participate in the war , women found other ways to throw their support behind the troops wives and mothers assumed what were known as comfort roles during @entity38 while looking after the household and children more than 60,000 @entity2 men lost their lives during battle , pictured here are soldiers in @entity192 , @entity193 before they departed women enjoyed a greater sense of autonomy within society while scores of men were on the battlefields in the home the women stepped up into traditionally male roles , and had a greater sense of autonomy within society			1
' in many households women took the dual role of mother and head of the household in the absence of men ' , professor @entity19 said			2
however when , or if , the men returned , there was a strong push towards restoring traditional gender roles			1
professor @entity19 , who is one of @entity13 's most influential public intellectuals , whose most widely known work is the @entity222 , which focuses on various aspects of war history in @entity13 but also worldwide			0
however they were expected to move back in to traditional gender roles once , or if , the men returned one in ten soldiers , seen here cleaning their rifles in the trenches , never made it home the @entity231 was one of the charities which many women volunteered for post-war , despite the expectation for women to assume their gendered roles , some war widows would not have that opportunity and would be raising their children as single parents			1
small towns were left with gaping holes in their populations when men did nâ€™t return and people often lost many men from the one family			0
there were also the husbands and sons who returned from battle so damaged that they simply could n't cope with the demons from war and were unable to care for themselves , let alone their offspring			2
many men who returned suffered deep physical and mental scars from the war reunions were held at the end of the war , like this one in @entity260 , @entity13			0

one in ten @entity2 men never returned home from battle
women back home assumed traditionally male roles in the house
volunteered their time to collect donations and knit socks for soldiers
@entity2 women 's influence over conscription laws was unique
