mr @entity15 said : ' i concluded that i faced a choice either to accept the sum which mr @entity1 had demonstrated he could afford or proceed to court , risking an estimated overall six - figure sum in court costs which was unlikely to be realistically recoverable			2

' however , the case has cost me several thousand pounds already and the public a great deal more			0
the only people benefiting have been lawyers			0
' i made the decision that the best course of action was to settle now to prevent the costs escalating further			0
