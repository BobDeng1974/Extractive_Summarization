the source told the @entity89 the controversial couple had their phones tapped			0
it follows news confirmed by a @entity95 inquiry that @entity97 images of @entity8 's final hours , supposedly lost , have been held in secret			1
the source , who worked in ' black ops ' , told the paper : ' there is no doubt that this technology was used on @entity8 and all around her , and for very human reasons she was regularly listened to live in the moment			2
' he added , because she was a prime intelligence target , @entity85 operatives ' would have wanted and had the capacity to listen live to the conversations in the car as it sped away from the @entity112			0

@entity65 's father , @entity136 has always asserted the pair 's deaths were the result of a planned murder at the hands of the @entity142 and @entity143 , and similarly claims a white @entity144 was involved in the crash but has never been traced			0

she reportedly also wrote to prime minister @entity179 , defence secretary @entity180 and army head general sir @entity181 about the @entity40 's aggressive behavior following the break down of his marriage			0
