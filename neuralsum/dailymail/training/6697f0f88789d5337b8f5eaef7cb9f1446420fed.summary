a teacher has been tortured and beheaded by her neighbours in a @entity3 village because they say she was a witch responsible for the death of a sick villager			1
the angry mob brandishing guns , machetes and axes surrounded her house and pulled @entity12 , her sister and two nieces away			1
they then burnt down the house			1
they say a swarm of fire flies led them from the deceased person 's grave to her house - sure evidence they say that she was a sorcerer and was practicing black magic			1
mobs : violence is escalating in @entity3 ; villagers in february burnt a woman alive , pictured , after accusing her of witch craft @entity12 's older sister and younger nieces were slashed with knives , then released after negotiations with police			1
but the mob went on to torture the former teacher , in her 40s , and then publicly cut off her head			0
the sickening and heinous act is one of many horrific similar stories coming out from the island , often considered a paradise in the @entity44			0
in february a young woman was stripped by angry armed villages , tied up and burnt alive			0
her crime ? allegedly more black magic			0
the beautiful tropical island , which was only discovered by the western world in the 1930s , is a complex mix of ancient tribes and western industrial influences , from the gold rush period and more recently , mining			0
but for tribes people still living by ancient social rules , violence , as opposed to dialogue , is the most common means of problem solving			0
speaking to the @entity63 , dr @entity64 , a former @entity66 volunteer who worked in a hospital clinic in @entity3 , said violence was so bad , she was unable to leave her house at night			2
violence : @entity3 is rife with violence , in part due to its trial culture			0
fights broke out last year during elections and armed guards and police fired shots , pictured ' @entity71 is a huge problem out there			0
almost every case that came to the hospital @entity83 department was to do with violence			0
whenever there was a disagreement it was n't verbal , it was always physical ; that 's how they dealt with things because it 's a tribal culture			0
' @entity94 - based gp , dr @entity64 , who helped run a clinic for victims of domestic and sexual violence , said she was aware of the strong belief in sorcery , which was systemic in the local society			1
she said : ' the guard to our house told me his brother and his brother 's friend had been killed by a lightening bolt while playing rugby in a big field			2
' he said all the people in the village had gone on a witch hunt to find out who in the village had caused the lightening bolt to kill his brother - they said it was sorcery			1
' this was typical of village behaviour in the highlands of @entity3 - far from the idyllic and more developed southern tourist resorts			2
the idea of ' pay - back ' is and engrained principle in the local culture			2
but with the introduction of western consumption , and products such as televisions and branded clothes , there is now even more for the tribes to fight over			0
dichotomy : the violence and tribal culture in the highlands of @entity3 are a far cry from the tourist traps in the south of the island the sickening and heinous act is one of many horrific similar stories coming out from the island , often considered a paradise in the @entity44 while there is a genuine belief among many of the tribes , particularly in the highlands , in sorcery and black magic , experts claim sorcery is used as an excuse for jealousy			1
@entity159 , chairwoman of the @entity160 , which is based in the area @entity12 was killed , told @entity162 : ' jealousy is causing a lot of hatred ... people who are so jealous of those who are doing well in life , they resort to what our people believe in , sorcery , to kill them , to stop them continuing their own development			1
' according to reports , @entity12 's house stood out since it was ' permanent ' , or built of wood			1
her husband and son had government jobs and the family had tertiary educations and high social standing			0
she said this was ' definitely a case of jealousy ' because of her family 's position in the village			2
attacks of such nature have been reported by the hundreds , according to the @entity191 , and are often carried out with impunity			2
@entity3 lies on the edge of the @entity44 for 42 years , the country 's @entity194 allowed for a belief in black magic to be used as a partial legal defense for killing someone suspected of inflicting harm through sorcery			1
only last month , the government repealed the law in response to the recent violence			0
but black magic alone appears not to be the main cause of such violence ; neighbouring @entity208 and the @entity209 also have a strong belief in sorcery , but without the same levels of violence			1
it appears @entity3 's relative wealth , and subsequent faster economic growth , are to blame			2
the country has a wealth of mineral resources and natural gas , which has propelled @entity3 from a long - stagnant economy into one of the world 's fastest growing over the past decade			1
economic growth has increased on average almost 7 per cent annually from 2007 to 2010 .			0

@entity12 was *dragged* from her home tortured and beheaded in public
villagers said fire flies led them to her house - a sign she was a witch
they accused her of killing another villager - who died from sickness - with her sorcery
experts say *disparity* in wealth and jealousy are main reasons for increases in such attacks
