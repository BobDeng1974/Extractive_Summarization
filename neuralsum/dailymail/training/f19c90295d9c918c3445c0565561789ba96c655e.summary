a @entity1 tourist told yesterday of his flight of terror when he claims an emergency exit on a super jumbo blew open at 27,000ft			1
@entity6 and his son @entity7 feared a bomb had gone off after hearing a ‘ massive explosion ’ two hours into their flight on the brand new £ 250million @entity13 @entity12			1
freezing air blasted in and the cabin pressure plunged after the door in business class came an inch and a half ajar , leaving a gaping hole , said mr @entity6			1
astonishingly , according to mr @entity6 , instead of making an emergency landing , the crew decided to stuff blankets and pillows stuck together with gaffer tape into the hole and continue the flight despite a horrendous droning noise and sub-zero temperatures			2
an open door on an aircraft is a serious emergency because it leads to a sudden loss of cabin pressure			2
oxygen levels inside an aeroplane have to be carefully controlled because the air in the atmosphere gets ‘ thinner ’ – it contains less and less oxygen – the higher you climb			2
cabins of planes cruising above 12,000ft are kept pressurised to mimic conditions at around 6,000ft and keep up the levels of oxygen			0
a sudden rush of ‘ thin air ’ from outside can cause passengers and crew to experience ear and stomach pain , or even black out due to lack of oxygen			1
@entity68 , of the @entity67 , said : ‘ for a door to open or for a significant gap to appear is extremely rare			0
’ the drama happened on monday as the two @entity1 flew from @entity72 to @entity73 as part of what was planned as a ‘ trip of a lifetime ’			1
he said : ‘ we were about two hours in when suddenly there was a huge blast			1
‘ it was a real shock , so loud that i thought a bomb might have gone off			0
@entity85 was gushing into the cabin like a gale			1
' the stewardess jumped up and stared at the door			2
her face was drained white			0
' she ran up the aisle , grabbed the intercom and started screaming , “ the door ’s going to go , the door ’s going to go ! ” then she hid under her chair			1
‘ other passengers were crying and saying “ we ’re going to go down , we ’re going to go down			2
” ' it was complete panic			0
the emergency door was ajar and leaving a gaping hole			0
you could see straight out into the atmosphere , 27,000ft up			0
’ mr @entity6 , who has a private pilot ’s licence , said that after several moments of confusion , the cabin crew started grabbing blankets and pillows which they stuck together with duct tape to fill the gap			2
he added : ‘ this is a state - of - the - art plane but they were using the most crude method you could imagine to try and plug the hole			0
‘ the conditions were terrible for the rest of the flight			2
the door continued to make a horrendously loud droning sound which made it impossible to speak to each other			0
drama : passengers heard a loud bang as their jet flew on monday to @entity73 from @entity72 ordeal : a relieved passenger checks his hand baggage on arrival in @entity73 ' worst of all , it was absolutely freezing			1
it was an extremely nerve - wracking experience for everybody			0
’ he said cabin crew closed the curtain between business class to stop those in the economy cabin below discovering what was happening			2
mr @entity6 claims he suffered a chest infection following the ordeal and the pair had to cut short their £ 4,500 trip			0
his 18 - year - old son reported the incident to the @entity153 ’s @entity152 who have passed it on to air investigators at the @entity158 general @entity159			1
an @entity158 spokesman said : ‘ we can confirm there was a whistling noise emanating from one of the doors on the @entity12 upper deck on flight @entity167 between @entity72 and @entity73 on monday , february 11			1
at no point was the safety of the flight in jeopardy			1
’ an @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ it is not possible for a cabin door to open on an @entity12 or on any aircraft whilst in flight , as doors open inwards and have locking mechanisms			1
’ an @entity158 spokesman later updated the company 's statement responding to mr @entity6 's claims , saying : ' at no time during the flight did one of the upper deck doors open			1
there was also no loss in cabin pressurisation at any time during the flight			1
' the noise from the door was caused by a small dimensional difference between the inflated door seal and the door lower frame striker plate , when the door is in the closed position			0
' this is currently under investigation in conjunction with @entity12			0
emirates have now fixed the problem			0
' the blankets were placed around the door to abate the whistling sound emanating from the door , not to prevent the door from opening			0
' there was no point during the incident where the safety of the flight was in jeopardy			1
' in addition , the green light next to the door does not represent that the door is open			0
it is an @entity221 and is used for communication information for the @entity223			0
