photographs of the amended signs have gone viral online			0
despite the controversy , earlier in the week the company announced on @entity79 it had made sales of £ 1 million and attracted 20,000 new customers in just four days following the advert ’s release			2
@entity9 has taken a strong stance on social media during the furore and has posted blunt replies to complaints on @entity79 , including ‘ why make your insecurities our problem ’ and ‘ grow up ’			2
the company ’s ceo and founder , @entity95 , has even branded the people defacing his adverts ‘ terrorists ’ , ‘ irrational and extremist ’			0

he said : ‘ first , we ’ve been inundated , as you ’ve probably seen from our @entity79 feed and @entity112 , of people defacing adverts , ripping them down and climbing over rail tracks to graffiti them			0

it ’s not a new concept			0
’ he confirmed the model in the picture , @entity185 @entity184 , 23 , had achieved her enviable physique using @entity9 products , and denied the image had been retouched or altered			1
