it 's too soon to tell whether @entity13 will bring anything dramatic weather-wise , but meteorologists say there will be a weaker cold front arriving thursday which will bring only light snow			1
it may be slightly warmer closer to the weekend , with temperatures looking as if they 'll hit the 30s , but there could still be sleet , snow or freezing rain			1
not that the guys who will take the field at @entity67 have any complaints or concerns			2
they would play this one on the @entity71 tundra or in @entity72			2
' my team is excited , ' @entity73 said after the @entity15 ’ flight landed in @entity71			2
' we worked hard to earn this opportunity			2
we could n’t be more excited			0

practicing in another team ’s facility : the @entity16 at the @entity120 ’ complex across the parking lots from @entity67 , the @entity15 at the @entity122 ’ place in @entity124 , about 30 minutes from the @entity6			1
both coaches , @entity15 ’s @entity126 and @entity127 ’s @entity40 , expressed concern about the outdoor practice fields being covered with snow or frozen			2

' @entity13 is a big deal , ' he said			1
' i know how hard it is to get here			0
i know the sacrifice the team made			0
' that they will sacrifice the comfort of playing in a dome , or in a warm climate , in this @entity13 does n’t seem to be fazing them a bit			1
instead , the @entity15 want to embrace the cold , the winds , the snow — and everything else that comes along this week in the first @entity13 ever played outdoors in a cold - weather city			1
' we ’d love to play in 70 - degree weather , ' said @entity15 15 - year veteran cornerback @entity182 , who has reached his first title game			1
