when people are in a bad mood , they are more likely to actively search social networking sites like @entity4 to find friends who are doing even worse than they are			1
that 's according to a study that found that , in general , people use social media to connect with people who are posting positive and success - oriented updates			1
but when they were in a negative spiral they would search for others who were also having a similarly bad day - or worse			2
research led by @entity18 has found that people in a negative mood like to see others who are also doing badly on social networks			1
normally people preferred positive and upbeat statuses			1
but when upset they looked at people rated unsuccessful or unattractive the study was published online in the journal computers in @entity28			1
it involved 168 college students , with the researchers first putting participants in a good or bad mood by having them take a test on facial emotion recognition			2
regardless of their answers , the students were randomly told their performance was ' terrible ' to put them in a bad mood or ' excellent ' to put them in a good mood			0
afterward , all participants were asked to review what they were told was a new social networking site called @entity44			2
earlier this week the @entity46 - based firm revealed that it carried out an experiment during a week in 2012			2
during that time , negative posts were deprioritised in the data feeds of 689,003 users , to see if it generated a more positive response			0
posts were determined by the experiment to be positive or negative if they contained at least one positive or negative word			0
the experiment affected around 0.04 per cent of users - or 1 in 2,500			0
according to @entity4 , nobody 's posts were ' hidden , ' they just did n't show up on some feeds			0
it found that negative posts elicited a swell of positive responses , but also that a reduction in positive news led to more negative posts			1
‘ when positive expressions were reduced , people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts ; when negative expressions were reduced , the opposite pattern occurred , ’ said the researchers			1
overall , the researchers found that people tended to spend more time on the profiles of people who were rated as successful and attractive			2
but participants who had been put in a negative mood spent significantly more time than others browsing the profiles of people who had been rated as unsuccessful and unattractive			1
the overview page presented preview profiles of eight individuals , which the students could click on to read more			0
the key to the study was that the eight profiles were designed to make the people profiled appear attractive and successful - or unattractive or unsuccessful			2
each profiled person was ranked on a scale of 0 to 5 on both career success and attractiveness , or ' hotness '			0
the profile images were blurred so that participants could not see what they actually looked like			0
when participants clicked on the profiles , they found that all the status updates were much the same			0
they were all relatively mundane and did n't discuss any career or academic success , physical appearance or romantic relationships			0
the results were based on a fake social network site created by researchers called @entity44 ( screenshot shown ) where people were rated according to career success and attractiveness			1
' if you need a self - esteem boost , you 're going to look at people worse off than you , ' said author @entity117 - @entity116 ' when people are in a negative mood , they start to show more interest in the less attractive , less successful people on their social media sites , ' said dr @entity116 , co-author of the study and professor of communication at @entity18			1
these findings give more context to recent studies that found people who spend a lot of time on @entity4 tend to be more frustrated , angry and lonely - perhaps because positive updates from friends make them feel inadequate			1
' people have the ability to manage how they use social media , ' said @entity138 , co-author of the study and assistant professor at @entity141			0
' generally , most of us look for the positive on social media sites			0
but if you 're feeling vulnerable , you 'll look for people on @entity4 who are having a bad day or who are n't as good at presenting themselves positively , just to make yourself feel better			0
' dr @entity116 added : ' if you need a self - esteem boost , you 're going to look at people worse off than you			1
' you 're probably not going to be looking at the people who just got a great new job or just got married			0
' one of the great appeals of social network sites is that they allow people to manage their moods by choosing who they want to compare themselves to			1
