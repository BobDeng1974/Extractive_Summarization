few thought the @entity1 juggernaut could be stopped this season , but @entity3 always expected the title race to go down to the wire			1
the west @entity6 started the campaign in astonishing form , leading one bookmaker to pay out on them winning the @entity11 after just 11 matches			1
@entity1 boasted an eight - point cushion over @entity14 at that point , although that lead now stands at just three			1
the gap would have been a single point had @entity20 's men not blown a two - goal lead to draw with @entity22 and fans ' favourite @entity3 insists complacency is not behind the difference being cut			1
@entity27 ( centre ) celebrates scoring @entity22 's equaliser against @entity14 on sunday ' i think it 's going to be tough , ' @entity3 said			1
' we knew it was not over			2
' a few years ago , i think we were 11 or 12 points in front of @entity35 and then they won the league			2
' so eight points or nine points - i do n't know how many points we had on top of @entity14 - i think it is not enough			1
' at that time of the season , it was too early , but i think now we start again a new championship			2
i think the game is on			2
' @entity1 will enter 2015 atop of the standings and were in the lead at @entity50 - something which has proven a good omen in the past for @entity53			1
@entity3 brings the ball down on his chest as @entity57 's @entity56 closes in the @entity58 has won the league on all seven occasion his sides have been leading on december 25 , but he suggests they would be in an even more comfortable position had the @entity63 not been the victim of a diving campaign			1
@entity53 went on that rant after being denied what he felt was a potentially match - defining penalty early in the second half of sunday 's 1 - 1 draw at @entity57 , when @entity71 went down under pressure from @entity73			0
instead of a spot - kick , however , referee @entity74 deemed it a dive and booked the infuriated @entity79 midfielder - part of a what @entity53 believes is a growing movement against his side			0
' it 's difficult from the bench to see , but i think the referee was close enough , ' @entity3 said of the @entity71 incident			1
@entity53 was fuming after referee @entity74 failed to give a penalty for this foul on @entity71 ' it 's his ( the referee 's ) opinion			0
i do n't know what to say			0
' [ @entity71 ] said it was a penalty , so i believe him			0
but , you know , it was still 1 - 1			0
' asked if diving something the players talk about between themselves or with the manager , @entity3 retorted : ' no. no. no. i think it is too much			1
' sometimes this kind of thing			0
i think it is a game , and the game is fast , so these kind of things can happen			0
but it 's not too much			0
' @entity53 's public comments about diving glossed over what was an at times ropey display at @entity109 's			0
@entity1 dominated in the second period but @entity111 's equaliser late first - half stoppage time was the only shot on target they mustered all afternoon			2
@entity111 ( centre ) celebrates scoring @entity1 's equaliser against @entity57 at @entity109 's ' i do n't know [ what was missing ] , ' @entity3 said			1
' i think for sure that playing 48 hours after the last game - maybe that affected the team			0
' but i think that was the same for both teams			0

@entity1 three points clear of @entity14 at top of @entity11
they had been eight points clear at one stage after *unbeaten* start
@entity1 *striker* @entity3 says he knew @entity14 would *challenge*
