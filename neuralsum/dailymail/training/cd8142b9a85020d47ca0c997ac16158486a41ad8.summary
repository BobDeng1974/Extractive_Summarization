a grandmother has been reunited with her @entity2 penpal 40 years after the pair lost touch – after bumping into her at an @entity6 supermarket			1
@entity7 , 60 , recognised her former penpal @entity9 when she overheard her @entity11 accent while waiting at the checkout of her local @entity6 store in @entity14 , @entity15			1
incredibly , the women , who wrote to each other for four years when they were teenagers in the late 1960s , discovered they had both moved to the same town and were living just one mile apart			1
however , the women - who both recently celebrated their 60th birthdays - eventually lost touch and drifted apart a few years later in the early 1970s			0
mrs @entity9 then moved to the @entity40 when she finished her studies in 1976 and married @entity42 - a friend of @entity7 's ex-boyfriend			1
ms @entity7 had no idea her @entity2 friend was living in @entity46 , even though she had introduced her to @entity42 on one of her visits from @entity11			1
in a bizarre coincidence , both of the women eventually ended moving to the @entity15 town of @entity14 – and now live just one mile apart			2
however , they had no idea they were living so close to each other until they bumped into each other for the first time in 40 years at @entity6 last august			2
they are now best friends , meeting up twice a week for coffee , and were guest of honour at each others 60th birthday party			0
they were reunited when ms @entity7 ( right ) spotted her former penpal at @entity6 last year and they have since become best friends , visiting each other several times a month and even attended each others birthday party they both unearthed their former letters , which they sent to each other in the late 1960s and early 1970s the letters , each carefully preserved and dated , show how the pair kept up - to - date with each others news in one heart - warming letter , which was unearthed in the attic , ms @entity7 addresses the note to ' my best friend ' ms @entity7 , who lives with her partner @entity81 , 59 , said : ' i was standing at the checkout and i saw a woman in front of me and just knew i 'd seen her somewhere before			1
' i just could n't place her but suddenly she spoke and i recognised her slight @entity2 accent			2
' it 's really funny to hear @entity9 speak now as she still says some phrases in a really @entity89 accent			0
' we were chatting for ages blocking the entrance and then we saw each other a few days later and i went around her house which was less than a mile from mine			0
' we now see each other every week and met up in time for her to come to my 60th party in september and i went to hers in january			0
' it really is weird , even though we have been apart for 40 years it is like no time has passed and we are best friends again			0
' mrs @entity9 , who works as a @entity2 teacher , added : ' @entity7 came over to me as she 'd seen me come out of the shop on her way in and watched me for a while to make sure it was me			2
ms @entity7 ( centre back ) was surprised at her 60th birthday party by her penpal @entity111 ( front centre ) , her brother @entity42 ( right ) and sister @entity114 ( left )			2
the former penpals are now best friends , enjoying regular visits ms @entity7 ( pictured in front of the @entity118 during a visit to her friend in 1973 ) is delighted to be reunited in the box of correspondence sent to one another in the 1960s and 1970s , the pair found this photo of mrs @entity9 in her hometown of @entity127 near @entity11 , aged 15 in 1970			1
it was the first she sent to ms @entity129 of herself one letter mrs @entity9 sent to ms @entity7 describes what she will wear when she arrives off the plane from @entity2			1
it was sent to her penfriend when she was just 17 - years - old and has been kept hidden away until now one letter sent from mrs @entity9 to her penpal calls her ' my dear @entity137 , my best friend ' and is dated 1973 ' she just said my name and i could n't place her but knew that i knew her			1
' i started looking down her face and then she smiled and i knew straight away that it was @entity7			0
' i knew the second that i saw that smile			0
' it was really nice too because we met just two weeks before her surprise 60th birthday party so her partner turned up at my door and asked me to go to that			0
' through my whole career i 've told the kids i teach that if they get the chance to have a penfriend they should take it because you never know where it will lead			0
' the women were randomly matched as penpals when ms @entity7 was a pupil at @entity162 in @entity163 , @entity164 , and mrs @entity9 was living in @entity165 in @entity11			1
they wrote to each other every few months until the early 1970s when they started to plan to meet for the first time			0

' i just fell in love with @entity214 and could n't get enough of it			0
' ms @entity7 added : ' i was desperate to go and see @entity11 after @entity9 had been here a few times			1
