by @entity0 published : 07:18 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 19:24 est , 7 april 2013 to the uninitiated , it looks as though the parishioners of @entity4 are being rather rude			1
but their tablet computers are n’t for sneakily checking their emails			1
instead , they ’re a very modern way for them to read hymns and prayers			2
yesterday the congregation took part in what is believed to be @entity16 ’s first ever digital church service			1
members of the congregation were handed tablet computers before the service , which they can use to enlarger the text of the service as they follow it the @entity16 's first digital church service allowed the congregation to follow the sermon , bible passages , prayers and hymns live on tablet computers the trial service that was delivered to tablet computers via service provider , @entity29 using @entity30 from a local cafe the digital service was designed to help some of the members of the congregation of @entity34 's who had been struggling to read the small text in the printed hymn and prayer books the idea came about after some parishioners said they were struggling to follow the tiny print in the church ’s pocket - sized hymn books because of their deteriorating eyesight			1
the tablets , with their bright displays and ability to enlarge the text , make it much easier for some of the older members of the congregation to follow the service			2
they access the hymns and prayers through a @entity30 installed in the church cafe next door			1
@entity57 , curate of the church in @entity59 , @entity60 , said : ‘ the church leadership team is really keen to make our services as accessible as possible			1
at the same time we are keen to use audio - visual technologies as much as possible by projecting our liturgy and songs on to large screens			0
‘ the two aims seemed to be in tension until we had wi - fi installed and began experimenting to replicate the exact content on to individual tablets for those with visual impairment of differing kinds			0
‘ we are delighted with the progress so far and look forward to see how we can develop things further			0
’ parishioners said they were delighted with the mini computers			2
@entity81 , 62 , who attended the service yesterday , said : ‘ we have one man who is registered blind and for him being able to blow up the text and then scan across using his finger was great			0
the worshipers at @entity4 join together to sing a hymn , following the verses on the illuminated screens of tablet computers church curate @entity91 said they are keen to use audio visual technologies as much as possible ‘ he did n’t need to fiddle with a book and any sort of magnification because what he needed was there already			1
’ he added : ‘ we have been experimenting with audio - visual technology for a while but to actually have it there in the palm of your hand is marvellous			0
it felt like you were holding a hymn book or prayer book , but you did n’t have to rummage around to find the right page			0
‘ it created a really nice atmosphere for the whole service and was really good fun			0
’ the church is working with networking company @entity29 , which agreed to donate the tablets to members of the community .			0
