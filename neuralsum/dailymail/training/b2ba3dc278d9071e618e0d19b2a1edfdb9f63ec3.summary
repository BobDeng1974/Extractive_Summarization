gang members who are more likely to commit violent crimes can now be identified by police using minority report - style software			1
@entity6 's @entity5 have tested a system that analyses a person 's criminal history and posts on social media to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime			1
the 20 - week pilot study , which is the first of its kind in the @entity18 , combined data from different crime reporting and crime intelligence systems used by the @entity5			1
@entity6 's @entity5 has tested a system that analyses a person 's criminal history and posts on social media to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime ' you 've got limited police resources and you need to target them efficiently , ' @entity27 , head of public safety analytics at @entity29 told the @entity33			1
' what this does is tell you who are the highest risk individuals that you should target your limited resources against			0
' the technology echoes the system used in the film minority report which predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before the crime takes place			2
developed by global consulting group , @entity29 , the latest software helped police analyse intelligence about known gang members across @entity6 's 32 boroughs across a four year period			1
the software helped police analyse intelligence about known gang members across @entity6 's 32 boroughs across a four year period			1
it was able to analyse social media posts , such as the image above , posted by a @entity6 gang who stole a fleet of expensive , high - performance cars last year police then compared the software 's results to known acts of violence that took place in the fifth year to find out its accuracy			1
mr @entity27 said the @entity5 were hoping to identify groups of gang members that were at the highest risk of reoffending rather than focusing on specific individuals			2
however , he was would not disclose the exact criteria on which the gang members were scored			1
@entity75 campaign group @entity74 has asked for more information to be made public about how the data will be used			1
' the police need to be very careful about how they use this kind of technology , ' said research director @entity82			0
when police in minority report predicted who would commit crimes , it was considered so futuristic , the film was set in 2054 when police in minority report predicted who would commit crimes and stopped them before they did it , it was considered so futuristic , the film was set in 2054			0
but last year , law enforcers in two @entity97 states used crime - prediction software to predict which freed prisoners are most likely to commit murder , and supervised them accordingly			2
instead of relying on parole officers to decide how much supervision inmates will need on the outside by looking at their records , the new system used a computer algorithm to decide for them			0
the minority report - style software is already being used in @entity111 and @entity112 to predict future murderers			0
it has been developed by professor @entity115 , a criminologist at the @entity116 , who believes it will reduce the murder rate and those of other crimes			0
professor @entity115 says his algorithm could be used to help set bail amounts and also decide sentences in the future			0
it could also be modified to predict lesser crimes			0
' big data solutions such as this can run the risk of unfairly targeting certain groups of people and potentially making them feel stigmatised as a result			0
' @entity29 has carried out other crime - prevention analysis elsewhere			2
for example , in @entity136 , @entity137 , police have applied the group 's predictive analytics to their theft data			2
this , it claims , has helped them identify the streets at greatest risk resulting in a 19 per cent drop in property theft without the need for more officers			0
in @entity152 , authorities are undertaking a ' @entity154 ' program that combines electronic vision technologies and predictive analytics into @entity158 video feeds to detect street incidents			0
@entity27 , head of public safety analytics at @entity29 , said the @entity5 was hoping to identify groups of gang members that were at the highest risk of reoffending rather than focusing on specific individuals			1

@entity6 's @entity5 tested system by @entity29 for 20 weeks
software analyses a person 's criminal history and posts on social media
data is combined to assess how likely it is for them to commit a crime
police analysed data about gang members across a four year period
they would not disclose exact criteria on which criminals were scored
