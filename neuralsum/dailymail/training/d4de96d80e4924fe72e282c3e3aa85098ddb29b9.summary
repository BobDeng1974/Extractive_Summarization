there may have been a deliberate effort by both clubs to kill the poison on the streets , but such pacifism certainly did not extend to the pitch as a fiery @entity7 was won at the death by @entity10 ’s @entity9			1
the fans – in a joint tribute to the two @entity14 fans killed in the @entity16 disaster – had applauded each other			2
the players , meanwhile , kicked each other			0
had it not been for @entity9 ’s 90th - minute intervention – his third straight goal at @entity20 – then this derby would have been defined by the seven yellow cards issued by @entity23			1
@entity9 wheels away to celebrate after scoring @entity10 's winner against @entity14 on sunday referee @entity23 speaks with @entity29 and @entity30 during the @entity7 there were reports of police having to separate rival fans before the game , but it was mr @entity23 who very quickly took on the role of law enforcer inside the ground			1
that the game expired with 22 men on the pitch owed a little to his strict handling of a ferocious first half , but also to his leniency after the break			0
@entity48 took just 30 seconds to make his mark on the contest – and @entity51 – with a robust block which upended the @entity14 defender			2
it was a cute – if cynical – tactic , for @entity23 was never going to produce a card at such a juvenile juncture			2
@entity10 centre back @entity59 , on loan from @entity61 , is booked by @entity23 fast forward 60 seconds , however , and @entity59 was not so fortunate , his chop on @entity63 drawing the game ’s first yellow			1
@entity30 joined him eight minutes later when his studs landed in the back of @entity68 – the same @entity68 who has been carrying a back injury of late			0
the skipper was booked but , had such an obvious offence occurred the other side of half - time , it may well have been a red card			0
of all the candidates to see red then perhaps @entity76 midfielder @entity75 ranked at the top of the list			0
that he collected his caution for such a needless climb over @entity29 served to highlight his favouritism in such a market – it also landed him with a one - game ban			0
former @entity10 man @entity87 was next into @entity23 ’s notebook when his high boot floored @entity90			1
@entity48 sensed blood – and the red residing in the referee ’s pocket – and duly threw himself to the floor under minimal contact from @entity87 moments later			2
his former team - mate was n’t best pleased and @entity23 was n’t impressed either			2
@entity14 midfielder @entity75 ( left ) looked like the candidate most likely to pick up a red card @entity14 midfielder @entity87 is grounded following a challenge from @entity10 's @entity90 neither was the whistler enamoured by @entity10 winger @entity29 when he clattered into @entity105 as the rookie goalkeeper came to fist clear inside the six - yard area			1
@entity87 , though , was fortunate to stay on the field moments later when , having tripped @entity110 as he scampered clear down the left , @entity23 chose to penalise @entity30 for an earlier infringement – it kept the contest at 11 apiece heading into the break			1
@entity48 – a surprise absentee from @entity23 ’s pad to this point – became the sixth player in the book when , having been outsprinted by @entity63 , he took a very deliberate swipe to ground the @entity122			0
he failed , but the intent was enough			0
there was no doubting @entity131 ’s entry soon after , the visiting captain scything down @entity126 with the midfielder in full flight by the touchline			0
@entity14 fans look on and sing as @entity10 supporters arrive at the stadium for the @entity136 clash @entity14 fans gather outside @entity20 prior to sunday 's @entity7 against @entity10 his opposite number @entity30 should have been dismissed for a trip which felled @entity140 , but a crowd of bodies saved the @entity143			1
@entity14 defender @entity144 had escaped caution but , as @entity9 skipped forward in the last minute , perhaps he wishes he ’d taken the winger out on halfway			1
ten seconds later and @entity9 was smashing the winning goal to spark mass celebration high in the @entity150 for the third season in a row .			0

@entity10 defeated @entity14 thanks to @entity9 's late winner
referee @entity23 was forced to show seven yellow cards
@entity14 's @entity87 faced former club @entity10 for first time
