his rival , @entity11 , from @entity4 , was at the base camp preparing for his own attempt on the summit next week			1
on his expedition 's website , @entity9 explained his attempt to scale @entity8 at such an advanced age : ' it is to challenge ( my ) own ultimate limit			1
it is to honor the great @entity38			0
' he said a successful climb would raise the bar for what is possible			0
' and if the limit of age 80 is at the summit of @entity46			0
@entity8 , the highest place on earth , one can never be happier , ' he said			1
@entity9 reached the @entity49 , the jumping - off point for most final ascents , on tuesday , according to his website , which also posted pictures of him eating hand - rolled sushi inside a tent			2

he reached the summit on may 26 , 2008 , at the age of 75 years and 227 days , according to @entity103			2

' i am fine and in good health			0
i am ready to take up the challenge			0
our plan is to reach the summit within one week			1

there are only a few windows of good weather during the climbing season in may for people to attempt the summit			0
conditions should be favorable wednesday and thursday , but they were expected to deteriorate after friday , said @entity59 , the mountaineering official at base camp			0
father and son : @entity9 has had three heart operations in recent years and suffered a broken pelvis and fractured thigh in a 2009 ski accident @entity11 's team is also facing financial difficulties			1
it has n't received the financial help that the @entity4 government announced it would provide them			2
@entity159 , chief of @entity4 's mountaineering department , said the aid proposal was still under consideration			2
@entity9 faced difficulties of his own			2
he fractured his pelvis and left thigh bone in a 2009 skiing accident , and had an operation in january for an irregular heartbeat , or arrhythmia , his fourth heart surgery since 2007 , according to @entity88			0
his daughter said @entity9 decided to go ahead with the expedition despite the surgery because he felt that at age 80 , he was running out of time			2
' if he was in his 60s , he probably would have waited for another year or two , but at the age of 80 he 's not getting any younger			0
he has a strong determination that now is the time , ' she said in a phone interview			0
on his ascent , @entity9 made a stop at the rarely used @entity184 to take a break between the @entity49 and the summit			1

" in 1964 , he briefly set a world speed skiing record in the @entity201 , reaching 172 kilometers per hour ( 107 mph )			0
he also skied down @entity46			0
it was n't until @entity9 was 70 , however , that he first climbed all the way to the summit of @entity8			1

after that , he said he was determined to climb again at age 80			0
