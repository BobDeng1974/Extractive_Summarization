@entity1 ’s @entity0 was accused of trying to ‘ pervert the course of justice ’ yesterday after it emerged it had contacted the police – at the request of @entity6 – to demand the release of an @entity9 gunman			1
an inquiry by @entity11 heard explosive new evidence from an ex-senior police officer linking the former prime minister to the controversial amnesty granted to on - the - run @entity9 suspects			1
it is the first time the @entity1 administration has been accused of direct interference on behalf of @entity20 to secure the freedom of @entity9 terror suspects			1
a former senior @entity24 policeman says @entity1 's government tried to have a suspected gunman released from jail after @entity6 ( left ) put pressure on @entity0 @entity29 , former detective chief spt of the @entity30 , said he had arrested two men in march 2007 in relation to the shooting of a soldier			1
he said that , within hours , @entity20 president @entity6 had contacted no 10 to request the release of @entity36 , 55 , and @entity37 , 51			1
mr @entity29 claimed : ‘ @entity0 rang the chief constable ’s office looking for their release			1
i got a call suggesting i should release them			2
' that in my mind is perverting the course of justice			2
that , as a police officer , is totally illegal and unconstitutional ’			1
mr @entity29 refused the request and , four years later , @entity36 was convicted of the attempted murder in 1981 of part - time @entity52 ( @entity52 ) soldier @entity54			1
mr @entity37 was acquitted of helping with the attack			0
the @entity57 committee is probing the case of @entity59 , who was accused of the 1982 @entity9 murder of four soldiers in the @entity63 bombing			2
to widespread fury , the charges against mr @entity59 were dropped earlier this year after it emerged he had been mistakenly sent a letter by the @entity68 saying he was not wanted in @entity69 for any criminal offences			0
ministers had sought to lay the blame on the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) , which supposedly supplied the information that mr @entity59 was not wanted by the @entity75			0
but mr @entity29 categorically denied this was the case and accused the current @entity77 , @entity78 , of ‘ disgracefully ’ trying to shift the blame away from the politicians and on to police			2
in evidence to the @entity82 , mr @entity29 claimed there was ‘ a culture within the @entity68 to ensure that republicans were not prosecuted ’			0
around 200 on - the - run terror suspects were granted an effective amnesty following the 1998 @entity88 negotiated by mr @entity1			2
the then prime minister was under pressure from @entity20 to grant them amnesty to secure the peace			0
former @entity73 assistant chief constable @entity93 also gave evidence to the committee			0
he said the professionals at the @entity68 knew where the line constituting political interference was and did not cross it , as far as he was aware			0
he also insisted police acted properly			0
an independent review of the @entity59 case has been ordered by @entity104 .			0
