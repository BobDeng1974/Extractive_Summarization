a massive underground ocean on @entity2 's largest moon , @entity3 , is as salty as the @entity5 's @entity4 , it has been revealed			1
@entity7 scientists analyzing data from the @entity10 mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts			1
they say the density of the oceans mean they are are salty as the @entity4			0
researchers found that @entity3 's ice shell , which overlies a very salty ocean , varies in thickness around the moon , suggesting the crust is in the process of becoming rigid			1
@entity7 scientists analyzing data from the @entity10 mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts			2
using the @entity10 data , researchers presented a model structure for @entity3 , resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon 's outer ice shell			1
researchers found that a relatively high density was required for @entity3 's ocean in order to explain the gravity data			1
this indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur , sodium and potassium			2
the density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on @entity5			0
it is believed the ocean is made of sulfur , sodium and potassium			1
the new results come from a study of gravity and topography data collected during @entity10 's repeated flybys of @entity3 during the past 10 years			1
using the @entity10 data , researchers presented a model structure for @entity3 , resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon 's outer ice shell			1
the findings are published in this week ’s edition of the journal @entity70			0
' @entity3 continues to prove itself as an endlessly fascinating world , and with our long - lived @entity10 spacecraft , we ’re unlocking new mysteries as fast as we solve old ones , ' said @entity76 , @entity10 project scientist at @entity7 's @entity77 , who was not involved in the study			1
the salt content allows the bathers to read while floating effortlessly in the @entity4 , @entity82			0
experts say the underground ocean on @entity3 would be similar			2
additional findings support previous indications the moon 's icy shell is rigid and in the process of freezing solid			0

' this is an extremely salty ocean by @entity5 standards , ' said the paper 's lead author , @entity110 of the @entity112 in @entity113			0
' knowing this may change the way we view this ocean as a possible abode for present - day life , but conditions might have been very different there in the past			0
' @entity10 data also indicate the thickness of @entity3 's ice crust varies slightly from place to place			1
the researchers said this can best be explained if the moon 's outer shell is stiff , as would be the case if the ocean were slowly crystalizing , and turning to ice			0
this image provided by @entity7 is a recent photo from the @entity10 spacecraft showing planet @entity2 , and if you look very closely between its wing - like rings , upper left , reveals a faint pinprick of light			0
that tiny dot is @entity5			0
otherwise , the moon 's shape would tend to even itself out over time , like warm candle wax			0
this freezing process would have important implications for the habitability of @entity3 's ocean , as it would limit the ability of materials to exchange between the surface and the ocean			2
a further consequence of a rigid ice shell , according to the study , is any outgassing of methane into @entity3 's atmosphere must happen at scattered ' hot spots ' -- like the hot spot on @entity5 that gave rise to the @entity167 chain .			2
