by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 10:34 est , 27 january 2014 when the @entity3 snaked its way through @entity5 , it sliced its way through ancient canyons , at least one of which was 70 million years old			1
this is according to a new @entity12 study which claims that while parts of the gorge are ancient , the river only carved the present form of the @entity17 less than 6 million years ago			1
the makes the world famous landmark relatively young in geological terms , and 65 million years younger than previously believed			0
researchers divided the @entity17 into sections and analysed the rocks in each			0
they found that most of it was put in place just five to six million years ago			2
earlier studies had claimed the canyon was perhaps 70 million years old the debate over the age of the @entity17 has raged for 150 years			2
proponents of ' old canyon model ' argue that the @entity17 was carved 70 million years ago in the same place and to nearly the same depth as the modern canyon			1
there is a group of researchers , however , that support the ' young canyon model ' , which claims the canyon was cut entirely in the last six million years			2
this new study refutes both of these models by arguing that some segments are very ancient , but says the full system - which makes up the majority of the @entity17 - is young			0
the study , however , will do little to settle the debate over the @entity17 's age			0
much of the canyon 's history has been eroded or carried away by the river			0
what remains is open to interpretation , with some scientists suggesting the gorge can not be defined as the ‘ @entity17 ’ without the @entity3 river running through it			0
geologists used a technique called thermochronology which dates events by measuring temperature of rocks , revealing when those at the surface now replaced others that had been removed by erosion			0
the study , published in @entity67 , found two parts are ancient , one being created between 50 and 70 million years ago and the other 15 to 25 million years old			1
but the remaining two were carved just five to six million years ago when the @entity17 became one giant thoroughfare when all the smaller segments became linked due to erosion from the @entity3			1
the data found one segment known as @entity74 was beneath several kilometres of rock strata and so was not carved until the last six million years			2
another called the eastern @entity17 , the area visited by five million tourists to the @entity78 a year , was about half carved to the level of the red cliffs between 25 and 15 million years ago			1
but the inner gorge was carved in the last six million years by the powerful @entity3			0
professor @entity82 , of the @entity83 , @entity84 , said the timing of the @entity17 's formation has been vigorously debated for almost 150 years			0
geologists used a technique called thermochronology which dates events by measuring temperature of rocks , revealing when those at the surface now replaced others that had been removed by erosion ‘ in one view , most of the canyon was carved by the @entity3 relatively recently , in the past five to six million years , ’ he said			1
‘ alternatively , the @entity17 could have been cut by precursor rivers in the same location and to within about 200 metres of its modern depth as early as 70 to 55 million years ago			1
’ the study , however , will do little to settle the debate over the @entity17 's age which has raged for decades			0
much of the canyon 's history has been eroded or carried away by the river			0
what remains is open to interpretation , with some scientists suggesting the gorge can not be defined as the ‘ @entity17 ’ without the @entity3 river running through it			0
‘ two of the three middle segments , the @entity119 segment and the @entity120 , formed between 70 and 50 million years ago and between 25 and 15 million years ago , respectively , ’ said professor @entity82			1
‘ however , the two end segments , the @entity74 and the @entity122 , are both young and were carved in the past five to six million years			1
‘ thus , although parts of the canyon are old , we conclude the integration of the @entity3 through older palaeocanyons carved the @entity17 , beginning five to six million years ago			1
’ the data found one segment known as @entity74 ( pictured ) was beneath several kilometres of rock strata and so was not carved until the last six million years			2

geologists dated sections of canyon by measuring temperature of rocks
found that @entity17 is a *series* of smaller canyons and that it only formed as it looks today six million years ago
@entity119 segment and @entity120 , formed between 70 and 50 million years ago and between 25 and 15 million years ago , respectively
two end segments , @entity74 and the @entity122 , are both young and were carved in the past five to six million years
