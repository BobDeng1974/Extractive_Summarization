the first private healthcare operator to run an @entity2 hospital trust is to pull out of the deal , claiming it is ' no longer sustainable ' due to funding cuts , and unprecedented pressure on @entity7 services			1
circle holdings was hailed a ' miracle cure ' for the @entity2 when it took over hospitals in @entity12 in 2012 , as rates of patient happiness soared and waiting times plummeted			1
at the time , experts said the system in place at @entity19 could be used in dozens of other struggling @entity2 trusts			1
but the operator will now pull out of the deal - a move that will cost it an extra £ 2m			1
the private company which turned failing @entity25 ( pictured ) in @entity26 , @entity12 , into an award - winner is set to pull out of running services , blaming soaring costs and funding cuts circle holdings said the level of cash it had pumped in to prop up @entity19 healthcare trust in @entity12 was about to reach £ 5 million , meaning it would have the right to terminate the franchise			1
it pointed to ' significant changes in the operational landscape for @entity2 hospitals ' since the contract was first procured in 2009			0

it also said it was facing an imminent report from the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) which it expected to be ' unbalanced '			1
circle began operating @entity26 in february 2012 , the first time the management of an @entity2 trust had been delegated to a private company			2

the majority of the 15 board members are now clinicians			0
doctors , nurses and admin staff were put into small groups with representatives who meet senior managers twice a month to flag up problems			0
nurses could recommend that consultants adjust the way they worked and any problems reported by patients had to be dealt with within three weeks it warned in august that changes to funding mechanisms had left ' uncertainty over @entity26 's profitability over the next year ' though it said its ' patient - centred and innovative approach should ensure the long - term sustainability of the contract '			2
but it spelled the end of the venture in a statement today			0
it said : ' circle today announces that it has determined that its franchise to operate @entity144 is no longer sustainable under current terms			1
