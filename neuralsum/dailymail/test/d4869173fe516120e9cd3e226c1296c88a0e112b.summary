the average @entity0 eats four servings of cheese a week we @entity3 certainly do love to keep things local , as over three quarters of us go crackers for cheddar , crowning it our favourite cheese variety			1
least favourite cheeses , according to a new survey , are @entity14 feta , @entity16 camembert and @entity18 cream cheese			1
and while the @entity16 are renowned for their love of the stinky stuff , we are not far behind , with the average @entity0 eating their way through four servings a week			1
the research , which was conducted by pickle brand @entity24 also revealed that a surprising one in four cheese fanatics ( 26 per cent ) admit to eating melted cheese with everything			1
a third of @entity30 ( 30 per cent ) say they ca n't enjoy cheese without a dollop of their favourite pickle while almost three quarters admitted to reaching out for a cheese sandwich when feeling peckish			1
in fact , three in ten office workers tuck into cheese sandwiches for lunch each work day without fail			1
if we 're not putting slices in our sandwiches , one in ten of us are eating whole blocks of cheese in one sitting			1
our second favourite is mozzarella with almost two in five ( 38 per cent ) enjoying the ever versatile soft @entity51 cheese			1

cream cheese ( 14 % ) another survey , this one by @entity70 , showed 32 per cent of office workers eat an identical lunch each day and have done so for nearly four and a half years on average			1
this is the equivalent of eating over 1,000 identical cheese sandwiches			1
commenting on our attraction to repetition , food psychologist , @entity80 , who worked with @entity70 said : ' this research demonstrates that the repetition of eating the same food every day can provide reassurance and stability			0
' however we all have an innate desire for exploration and would benefit from shaking things up			0
' new tastes and experiences can excite and motivate us , especially when we have a far greater selection of foods to experiment with than we 've ever had before			0
