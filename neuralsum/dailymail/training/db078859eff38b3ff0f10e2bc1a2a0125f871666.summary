by @entity0 for @entity1 @entity3 fans were calling @entity5 ’s name at the @entity6 during their slender @entity8 victory over @entity9 – but not in a good way			1
the club ’s record signing was the lightning rod for grievances as the tension mounted and he gave possession away more than once with @entity17 in promising positions			0
when @entity19 was sent off late on it was @entity5 who @entity21 decided would be sacrificed so @entity22 could be sent on to shore up defence			1
possession is vital in closing out matches and at his best @entity5 treats the ball like @entity41 does his precious ring to rule them all ; protective and unyielding			1
but @entity5 has been struggling to reach his best in north @entity44			2
he arrived last summer amid much fanfare and with a £ 42.5million price tag his form was explosive			1
@entity32 players lined up to complain that their team ’s creative spark had been sold – @entity51 was particularly critical – and the deal looked a steal when @entity5 scored a sublime opener in early october ’s @entity8 victory over @entity56			1
he was the grandstand signing @entity3 fans had been crying out for during years of frugality from @entity21 , keen to balance the books with a new stadium to pay for			1
@entity21 threw off the shackles for @entity5 and the @entity63 supplied assists in kind – as well as a decent goal return of five goals in 18 games before @entity69			1
but the lack of a winter break to which he had become accustomed in @entity72 appeared to deeply affect the 25 - year - old of slight stature			2
there was fatigue in his game and a hamstring injury in march that kept him out for a month			0
he scored only two goals in his final 22 games			0
as he edged to fitness in april , @entity21 revealed : ‘ he had a period where he was tired because he was not used to playing a full season			1
happier times : @entity5 was a rising star in @entity86 with @entity32 before the £ 42.5million deal ' he 's a fantastic football player and i would put him on the list to be player of the season next season			1
’ a @entity93 where he starred for @entity72 followed , even if at times he was criticised for failing to impact matches throughout			2
in the early rounds , he would flirt with providing a lasting contribution			0
more often , though , he sparkled brightly but briefly			0
his best performance came against @entity98 in the last - 16 when he scored			0
he was also excellent in the 7 - 1 humbling of @entity99 although the headlines were elsewhere			0
it seemed he had his mojo back but his two appearances for @entity3 this season have been subdued			1
it might be that he still needs an extended break to recharge the batteries following a summer that provided him with little opportunity			0
@entity17 ’s arrival takes some of the focus away and you imagine he will thrive with better players around him			0
at @entity32 , he had the likes of @entity51 , @entity115 , @entity116 to feed			0
high five ! @entity5 celebrates with @entity51 ( right ) as @entity32 beat @entity118 back in 2011 all three are hulking forwards who enjoy making runs in behind defences			2
@entity3 are short on that type of player and perhaps @entity5 ’s ability to slot passes through the eye of a needle for quick strikers to run onto can not be harnessed in full in @entity21 ’s side			1
a statistic went round the internet in the wake of @entity134 ’s arrival at @entity135			0
to justify his huge fee it was noted he had made 49 league assists in the league since 2010 , the third-most of any player in @entity142 behind @entity143 on top with 57			0
lodged in between them was @entity5 , who has laid on 56 goals			2
it is that kind of world - class contribution that convinced @entity21 to splash the cash and it is what he now needs to bring out of his player once more .			2

@entity3 are yet to see the best of *midfielder* @entity5
@entity72 international cost @entity21 £ 42.5million last season
