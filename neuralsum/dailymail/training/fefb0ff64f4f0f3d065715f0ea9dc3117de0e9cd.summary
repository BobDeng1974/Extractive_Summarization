by @entity1 medical correspondent mothers - to - be who are overweight are more likely to lose their babies than those who are a healthy weight pregnant women who are overweight are more likely to lose their baby , warn researchers			1
a new research review shows women with a higher body mass index ( @entity12 ) before or in early pregnancy have a higher risk of the baby dying in pregnancy or labour , including stillbirth , and shortly after birth			1
severely obese women run the greatest risk - more than three times higher than women with the healthiest weight , say @entity26 researchers			1
but the risk starts to rise even when women are slightly overweight , according to a review of 38 studies			2
every day 17 babies in @entity32 die just before , during or soon after birth amounting to 6,500 babies a year			0
@entity36 figures show that each day there are 11 stillbirths where a baby is born dead after 24 weeks of pregnancy - making stillbirth 15 times more common than cot death			1
there are around 4,000 stillbirths every year in the @entity32 and one in every 200 births ends in a stillbirth			0
around 15 per cent of @entity32 mothers are obese when expecting a child - up from seven per cent 20 years ago , according to latest figures			2
doctors have warned the obesity epidemic among pregnant women is an ever - growing burden on the @entity36 and could jeopardise the health of the next generation			1
complications suffered by obese women in pregnancy range from diabetes to life - threatening pre-eclampsia , while babies born to fat women are at greater risk of diabetes and obesity themselves in later life			1
mp @entity67 , while public health minister last year , said it was ' absolutely bonkers ' that midwives were no longer routinely weighing pregnant women			2
in the new review , lead researcher dr @entity71 investigated the link between maternal weight and baby and infant deaths			2
altogether 38 studies included more than 10,147 foetal deaths , more than 16,274 stillbirths , more than 4,311 perinatal deaths , 11,294 neonatal deaths , and 4,983 infant deaths			0
the highest risk is among women who are overweight before pregnancy and in the early stages of pregnancy doctors use @entity12 ( @entity12 ) to assess whether patients are overweight by comparing height to weight , in a calculation which divides weight in kilos by height in metres squared			1
a bmi of 20 to 24.9 is healthy , while 25 to 29.9 is overweight and 30 - plus is obese			2
@entity12 of 40 plus is super-obese			0
the researchers found even ' modest increases ' in maternal @entity12 were associated with increased risk of the baby dying in pregnancy or labour , stillbirth , or death shortly after birth			1
severely obese women are three times more likely to lose their babies than healthy weight women the risk for super-obese women with a @entity12 of 40 was between two and 3.5-fold higher compared to women with a @entity12 of 20			1
but the rate of stillbirth per 10,000 pregnancies was 20 per cent higher for overweight women , and 50 per cent higher for obese women , says the study published in the @entity117			1
dr @entity71 said : ' weight management guidelines for women who plan pregnancies should take these findings into consideration to reduce the burden of foetal deaths , stillbirths , and infant deaths			0
' experts said the findings show the importance of being ' fit for pregnancy ' and healthy eating while pregnant , but stressed dieting was never recommended			0
in the @entity32 , there are no specific recommendations for how much weight a woman should put on during pregnancy			0
experts do not recommend weight loss in pregnancy , but advise bigger mums to keep their weight stable and aim to gain around 22lbs or 10kg only			0
a woman 's weight is currently only recorded when she goes for her first antenatal check , with more regular checks abandoned in the 1990s			0
@entity36 guidance tells women that during the first six months of pregnancy energy needs do not change , so no extra food is needed , while only 200 calories more a day is needed in the later stages .			0

pregnant women with a high @entity12 are more likely to have a stillbirth
they are also more likely to lose their baby shortly after birth
severely obese women have the highest risk - they are three times more likely to lose their baby than healthy weight women
