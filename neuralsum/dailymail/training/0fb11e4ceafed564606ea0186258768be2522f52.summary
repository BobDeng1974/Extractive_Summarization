by @entity0 a snack foods company plans to up the ante on their advertising techniques similar to the @entity5 movie @entity6 and ' watch ' every customer who shops for their delicious treats			2
@entity11 , whose portfolio includes the likes of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and other high - profile snacks , says it plans to debut a grocery shelf in 2015 , which comes equipped with sensors to determine the age and sex of passing customers			1
the shelf is hooked up to @entity31 ’s @entity30 controller , which is a motion sensing input device			0
pictures of people ’s faces will not be stored however the scanner will aggregate demographic data from the thousands of people who shop in these stores			0
the information will help the company build a more accurate understanding of what their consumers like to buy and thereby help funnel more of the desired products to the right shoppers			0
minority report : the new snack technology is similar to this movie in which @entity70 is bombarded by ' personalised advertising ' that reads his state of mind real time advertising : the technology will help to convince people who are undecided about what to buy through well - timed in - store commercials it is also hoped the new technology will help to convince people who are undecided about what to buy to make an impulse buy by offering well - timed in - store commercials or coupons when the embedded weight sensor learns they have picked up an item , according to the @entity88			1
it is something quite similar to the @entity5 film @entity6 , where @entity70 is bombarded from all sides with advertising that is based on his state of mind			1
the snacks company might not quite be there yet , but technology is certainly moving in that direction .			0

@entity11 , whose portfolio includes the likes of @entity15 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity21 , will *introduce* the shelves with motion sensors in 2015
they will be able to determine the age and sex of passing customers
the information will be used to build a portfolio of a potential snacker and create so - called ' personalised advertising '
the technology will also have well - timed ads in the shop to target *specific* customers based on weight sensors that show when an item is picked up
it is *reminiscent* of a scene from @entity6 with @entity70 where he is bombarded by ads from all sides that can read his state of mind
