by @entity0 published : 18:18 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 01:35 est , 30 september 2013 mockery : deputy labour leader @entity2 , pictured at last week 's @entity4 conference , was accused of ' sneering ' after she criticised @entity7 's plans to give married couples a tax break @entity4 and the @entity10 were accused of ‘ sneering ’ at marriage yesterday as @entity7 said he would like to go further in restoring recognition for the institution in the tax system			1
@entity4 ’s deputy leader @entity2 and shadow chancellor @entity16 led criticism of the prime minister ’s plans for a £ 1,000 transferable tax allowance for married couples , and the @entity10 also condemned it – opening up a key general election battleground			1
work and pensions secretary @entity22 , a champion of marriage , said : ‘ i ’m not sure why @entity4 are behaving as though this is a big surprise			1
the prime minister has always been very clear that this was a manifesto pledge and he would deliver it			1
‘ it strikes me that @entity4 are just using this as an opportunity to sneer at marriage			2
this is a popular policy that will help eight million hard - working people			1
’ the prime minister said he was ‘ proud ’ of the measure , which was revealed exclusively by the @entity36 on saturday , and would go further if re-elected with a @entity34 majority			1
married people who earn under the £ 10,000 income tax threshold will be able to transfer £ 1,000 of their allowance to a higher - earning spouse , reducing their annual tax bill by £ 200 from april 2015			1
couples where one spouse is a higher rate taxpayer – earning more than £ 42,285 in 2015 – will not be able to use the scheme			2
shadow chancellor @entity16 , in the crowd at the @entity4 conference in @entity48 , said women would ' lose out ' under the new proposals ‘ we are going to deliver , ’ the prime minister said			1
‘ it has taken longer than i would like because obviously we have been battling with all the economic problems in front of us – and we ’ve been in a coalition – but nonetheless we will in the next @entity57 be legislating for recognising marriage in the tax system			2
‘ obviously i ’d like to do more but i think it is right to start with people on relatively low earnings			1
’ but mr @entity16 said women ‘ lose out ’ , adding : ‘ it ’s insulting that £ 3.85 a week would persuade anyone to get married			1
and the money will be paid mainly to men not women			1
’ miss @entity2 said on @entity69 : ‘ married man ’s tax allowance will go to a man on his third wife but not to first two wives looking after his children			1
’ @entity76 , @entity4 ’s @entity77 spokesman , said mr @entity7 was ‘ so out of touch he thinks people will get married for £ 3.85 a week ’			1
@entity4 ’s home affairs spokesman @entity81 said : ‘ sadly it ’s clear that for this prime minister most people ’s love and commitment does n’t count			1
’ @entity88 pledge : the prime minister , pictured at the @entity34 party conference which began in @entity91 today , said he was ' proud ' of the measure , and would take it further if he was re-elected @entity77 spokesman @entity94 added : ‘ you do n’t build a fairer society by using the tax system to favour one type of family over another			1
’ conservative health secretary @entity101 insisted it was right to recognise marriage			0
he said : ‘ it is an institution that is the building block of our society			0
this is a measure that ’s going to help four million hard - working couples			2
’ dr @entity111 , of the think tank @entity112 , which has campaigned for such a move , said : ‘ we ’ve been calling for this since 2007			0
half of all children born today will not still be with both their parents by the time they ’re 15 and marriage is a more durable relationship			0
’ @entity122 , conservative mp for @entity123 , was a rare voice of criticism in his party			0
he said he regretted that the proposal ‘ may exclude ’ men or women on low incomes who have been widowed			2
i did n't expect gay marriage storm , says @entity7 by @entity134 regrets : a new book has has revealed that @entity7 told an ally he wished he had scrapped the law @entity7 admitted yesterday he had not foreseen the furore surrounding gay marriage legislation but did not regret pushing it through @entity142			0
a new book on the @entity144 , published today , claims the prime minister confided to an ally that he wished he had ditched the law as it caused such bad feeling with grassroots conservatives and backbench mps			1
the prime minister reportedly said : ‘ if i ’d known what it was going to be like , i would n’t have done it			1
’ when gay marriage came to a vote in the @entity158 earlier this year , which mr @entity7 had vocally championed , more than half of @entity34 mps refused to back him , meaning the @entity145 needed @entity4 and @entity77 support to get the legislation passed			0
@entity34 @entity155 claim that many party members tore up their membership cards in protest			0
the book , in it together by @entity166 , reveals : ‘ in his bleaker private moments , @entity7 was becoming savagely self - critical about his misreading of the party on gay marriage			0
“ this is down to me , ” he told one ally			0
but he was stuck with the measure now			0
’ in an interview with the @entity175 yesterday , mr @entity7 denied he had made the comment			0
he said : ‘ i do n’t regret it and @entity178 is a more equal and fairer country for having done it			0
i ’m passionate about marriage			0
i think it ’s a great institution and i think it should be available to people who are gay as well as to those of us who are n’t			2
’ but he added : ‘ i do n’t think i expected quite the furore there was			0
it ’s clearly been very difficult for some people to take on			2
’ under the legislation , the @entity189 was exempted from conducting gay weddings and other religious groups are allowed to refuse to do so			0
but mr @entity7 admitted that opponents of same - sex unions gained backing because he failed to explain that religious groups would not be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies against their will			0
‘ i ’m not sure we got across to people that this was about marriages that could take place in register offices – this was not going to change what happened in church , mosque or synagogue , ’ he said			2
‘ i ’m not sure we got that point across			0
