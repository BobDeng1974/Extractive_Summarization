a suspected @entity0 of a pouting young girl is believed to now be worthless after a vandal painted over it so she is now wearing a burkha			2
the artwork , which first appeared on the side of the @entity7 pub in @entity8 , west @entity9 , in 2007 , was defaced over the weekend			1
the 6ft tall mural , thought to be worth £ 100,000 , has the word ' smile ' in brightly coloured letters written above the girl , originally pictured in pigtails - but now only her eyes remain visible			1
the @entity0 of a pouting young girl in @entity8 , which first appeared in 2007 ( left ) was defaced over the weekend to show the girl wearing a burkha , leaving only her eyes visible local residents were left furious after the work - believed to be worth more than £ 100,000 - was vandalised , adding it had been the ' only thing that made them smile in @entity8 '			1
@entity24 said she was ' horrified ' when she saw the defaced artwork			1
she said : ' i 'm sure it brought a smile to the face of lots of other people passing by and it 's such a shame it 's been defaced like this			1
' @entity35 , 32 , added : ' i was walking to @entity8 station on sunday , which is right near the @entity0 and saw the girl had been covered with a burkha			1
' i do n't know what is wrong with people around here - it 's about the only thing @entity8 has got going for it and now it 's ruined			1
' twitter user @ missfab2014 said the work was the ' only decent thing ' in @entity8 and urged the artist to fix it a @entity51 user , known as @entity52 , urged the artist to come and fix the work			1
she said : ' the only decent thing in @entity8 and now look at it # banksy @ @entity57 come sort it out pls ! ! ' soon after the mural appeared in 2007 , @entity61 , the then landlord of the @entity63 pub - now a bar called @entity66 - installed cctv to stop the @entity0 being vandalised			1
it is not known if the cameras are still in place			2
he said at the time : ' i phoned the council to tell them not to paint over it because it was a work of art. ' they came to look at it and agreed with me			0
i think it is lovely			0
' update : a representative for @entity0 has confirmed to @entity82 that the work is not by the artist			0
the work has now been restored			0
because of the value attached to many of @entity91 's pieces , his work had long been targeted by thieves hoping to sell stolen work for huge amounts			0
but they 've also been attacked by vandals - some rival graffiti artists - for no other apparent purpose than to deface and destroy the work			0
his @entity100 painting , featuring three 1950s - style agents , wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats , using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box , appeared in @entity107 , @entity108 , in april last year			2
it soared in value when @entity0 confirmed it was one of his pieces - and the wall was boarded up but a bidding war ensued as locals tried to raise an estimated £ 1million to secure it for the town			2
it was defaced a few months later - and last month , the stencil was granted @entity122 - listed status			2
the ' @entity123 ' @entity0 in @entity107 features three agents , wearing brown trench coats and trilby hats , using devices to tap into conversations at a telephone box			0
pictured left , in 2014 and right , its defaced state but the owner of the property it is on says the work has ' ruined his life '			2
@entity136 , 45 , says he has been unable to remove and sell the work - and can not carry out building work to make the house habitable			0
last year , a @entity0 painting of a woman staring at an empty plinth on the wall of an amusement arcade in @entity145 , @entity146 , was valued at £ 300,000			0
the local council quickly placed a perspex cover over the mural to protect it , heading off a potential disastrous act of vandalism when someone later crudely scrawled a penis on the plinth			0
last october , a large mural in the elusive artist 's hometown of @entity158 - dubbed ' the girl with the @entity159 ' - had paint thrown over it days after it appeared			1
the work , a parody of the famous @entity164 by @entity166 master @entity165 , had a yellow alarm box replacing the earring from the original painting .			0
