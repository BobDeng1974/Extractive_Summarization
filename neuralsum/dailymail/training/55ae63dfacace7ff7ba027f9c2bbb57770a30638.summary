@entity0 at home chief executive @entity1 , pictured , defended the use of seasonal greeting cards to warn against reckless spending over @entity5 a housing association has been attacked as ' insensitive ' after it sent @entity5 cards to its tenants containing a notice about how far behind they are with their rent			1
@entity0 sent the cards which warned their tenants against over indulging over the @entity5 period and ensure their rent is paid			1
the housing association apologised to any tenants who felt offended by the notices , but said they were just trying to ensure compliance with this ' gentle approach '			1
one outraged tenant told the @entity18 : ' when the card came through the door , i thought how nice it was for @entity0 to wish me seasons greetings			2
' but when i opened it to see a reminder of my arrears and a warning about overspending at @entity5 i was mortified and really angry			1
i found it extremely patronising			2
i know what level of arrears i am in			2
it is under £ 150 and i am chipping away at it			1
' there was just no need for this because they send us formal reminders every 12 weeks			0
' it is not an easy time of year for a lot of people and i just think the way this was done could push people over the edge			0
' @entity0 at home chief executive @entity1 defended the use of seasonal cards to warn against spending recklessly over the festive period			1
' we have sent these cards out for about four years and the comments we have had back suggested that people preferred this approach at this time of year compared to a heavy arrears letter			2
' i fully accept that it could be taken both ways , but it is certainly not designed to offend anyone and if that has happened then i apologise			0
' there is no easy way to do this but this is the first time we have had complaints about the @entity5 cards and we will certainly take them on board			1
' mr @entity1 admitted that he has received a number of complaints that some of the cards had been sent out in unsealed envelopes			2
he added that it was not his intention to offend anyone during the holiday period			0
conservative councillor @entity72 supported the approach taken by @entity0 at home : ' landlords will often come across as insensitive or patronising but it is a no - win situation			1
there is also never a good time to remind people about rent arrears			1
' @entity0 at home is a registered charity which owns and manages more than 18,000 homes in the @entity0 council area			2
tenants of the @entity81 housing association who were in arrears received a special festive message ... ... warning that they are already behind with their rent and not to overspend this @entity5 housing association tenants have been warned against providing lavish spreads for @entity5 dinner as it may push them into debt and threaten their tenancy bringing them to the brink of eviction , file photograph the independent @entity101 recommends that tenants should ensure their rent as well as other priority debts are paid because of the dire consequences associated with non-payment			1
@entity101 said priority debts are not necessarily the largest or the ones with the highest interest rates			0
the most important debts are mortgages , rent and any loans secured against their home			0
failure to pay priority debts could see the householder evicted , have their gas or electricity service suspended or even jailed			0
@entity101 recommends that once the priority debts are cleared , it is then important to target the bill with the highest interest rate and try and clear that as quickly as possible by over-paying the minimum amount			0
however , the householder should not neglect other debts , as this could lead to penalty or default charges			0
source : @entity101 according to the housing association 's website , they charge a rent which is only 80 per cent of the property			0
meanwhile , @entity134 has warned its tenants not to allow their home to become someone else 's @entity5 present by failing to pay their rent or council tax			1
a statement released on the council 's website said : ' it ’s easy to spend too much money at @entity5 , especially if you have children , and it may be tempting to put off paying your rent or council tax			1
' but it is n’t easy to catch up @entity152 evicted 15 tenants for rent arrears last year and issued over 7,000 summonses to begin recovery action for council tax			1
' up to this october , we have raised 4,372 summonses to begin recovery action ; this process adds £ 120 to the debt already owed by each individual			2
' councillor @entity164 warned : ' most people are feeling the economic squeeze at the moment , particularly with the @entity169 changes such as the bedroom tax kicking in			0
but please make paying your rent and council tax a priority over @entity5 and @entity175 and do n’t risk losing your home			1
' we want people to pay up or seek help immediately before allowing their debts to spiral out of control so we can cut the eviction rate , as well as our arrears bill			0
' we work closely with the citizens ’ @entity184 , @entity185 , local credit unions and a wide range of other organisations offering advice and support to anyone with financial problems			0
' but we will evict or take legal action when necessary against our debtors , particularly where someone wo n’t pay , rather than ca n’t pay			0
