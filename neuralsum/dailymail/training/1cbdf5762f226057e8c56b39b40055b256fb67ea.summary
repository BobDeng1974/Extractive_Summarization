@entity2 hackers stole classified information from @entity5 officials involved in the search for @entity7 a day after the plane disappeared , it was claimed today			1
government departments were sent e-mails containing a virus disguised as a hoax news report saying the @entity14 jet had been found			1
when the attachment was opened , the virus - known as malware - began extracting sensitive data and sending it to a computer in @entity2			1
the attack came at a time when @entity5 officials in charge of the search were being heavily criticised - particularly by the @entity2 - for not releasing crucial information			1
but by then around 30 computers in the @entity35 , the @entity46 and @entity14 had been infected and an unknown amount of information stolen , a source said			2
@entity39 chief executive dr @entity49 told @entity50 from the @entity51 : ' we received reports from the administrators of the agencies telling us that their network was congested with e-mail going out of their servers			0
' those e-mails contained confidential data from the officials ' computers , including the minutes of meetings and classified documents			2
some of these were related to the @entity7 investigation			0
' this was well - crafted malware that anti-virus programs could n't detect			1
it was a very sophisticated attack			1
' desperate for information : @entity14 commercial director @entity73 ( centre ) speaks to journalists in @entity2			2
the cyber attack came at a time when officials were criticised for their handling of the search the breach was traced to an ip address - a unique number assigned to each computer on a network - in @entity2 , but no further details have been given			1
@entity87 are reportedly working with the agencies with the investigation			0
@entity7 vanished inexplicably en route from @entity91 to @entity92 on march 8 , and there has been no sign since of the aircraft or the 239 people onboard			0
reports of the hack come as @entity100 prime minister @entity99 said a new underwater hunt for missing @entity7 had a ' reasonable chance ' of finding the plane			2
it is believed to have crashed into the southern @entity105 far off the west coast of @entity107 , but a massive air and sea search failed to find any wreckage while an underwater probe gave no answers			0
experts have now used technical data to finalise the most likely resting place of the plane deep on the ocean seabed and are preparing for a more intense underwater search to find it			0
' they are now going to search the entire probable impact zone which is , from memory , something like 60,000 square kilometres ( 23,000 square miles ) of the ocean floor , off the coast of @entity107 , ' @entity99 told the @entity124			0
' if the plane is down there - and the best expert advice is that it did go into the water somewhere in this arc off the coast of @entity107 - if the plane is down there , there is a reasonable chance that we 'll find it because we are using the best possible technology			0
