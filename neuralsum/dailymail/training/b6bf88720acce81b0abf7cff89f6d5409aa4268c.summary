@entity2 have secured @entity11 forward @entity12 on loan with new @entity2 boss @entity0 aiming to sign another striker during the january transfer window			2
@entity1 is on the verge of completing a move back to the @entity18 to @entity3 @entity1 ( left ) signed for @entity7 in @entity19 in january last year , but is set to return to @entity10 the former @entity21 manager grudgingly admitted @entity1 's goal scoring prowess could ease @entity3 out of the @entity18 relegation battle			1
' i think it 's a good move for @entity3 to have secured @entity1 , i think he 's a goal scorer and @entity26 ( @entity27 ) will be the first to tell you they need more goals , ' said @entity0			1
' so it 's a good signing for them			0
' we tried to get @entity1 , but probably a bit late in the loop on that one			0
i would n't say we were that close , no. ' it never really got to the stage where i got to speak to @entity1 , so i would say we were not that close			0
' @entity0 admitted he wanted to take @entity1 to @entity2 but failed with a late attempt @entity2 signed @entity12 from @entity11 on loan but @entity0 is keen to add another striker in january @entity0 managed @entity1 at @entity43 before the prolific striker moved to @entity45			1
the 32 - year - old failed to warm to life in @entity7 after leaving @entity45 for @entity19 a year ago			0
@entity0 was forced to admit the 55 - cap forward could boost @entity3 's firepower , with the @entity3 one of @entity2 's main rivals in the battle to avoid the drop			1
the @entity2 ' new manager , however , warned that @entity1 must first prove he is capable of playing week on week to fulfil his @entity3 brief			2
' he 's still got to step in , i do n't know the last time @entity1 had a run of three or four @entity18 games , ' said @entity0			2
@entity1 scored 11 @entity19 goals for @entity7 but is set to sign a three - and - a - half year deal at @entity3 @entity1 could face former club @entity45 on his debut on saturday if he signs for @entity3 on friday ' he 'll be asked to start every week at @entity3 , so i think he 's going to have to grasp it quickly			2
' but he 's a goal scorer , he opens up the goal with both feet and gets goals that ( make ) you question your back four , he makes you think " how did he get that ? " ' but that 's his ability , you do n't really know which side he 's going to go , and he makes it difficult to stop him scoring goals			0
' i think he 'll do well for them , i think it 's a good signing			0
' but it 's like anything , he 'll need a goal early , all strikers need that for his confidence			0
