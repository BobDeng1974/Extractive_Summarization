by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor an independent @entity3 would be blocked from joining the @entity4 if @entity5 ploughs ahead with his ' bonkers idea ' of using the pound , it emerged tonight			1
@entity9 chief @entity8 warned it ' would simply not be possible ' to become an @entity4 nation if @entity12 did not have control of its own currency			1
@entity16 treasury minister @entity15 said the revelation meant an independent @entity3 would have to choose between ' using the pound like @entity18 uses the dollar , or joining the @entity4 '			1
mr @entity5 has insisted it would continue to use the pound , entering a currency union with the remaining countries in the @entity4			1
but @entity39 , the @entity38 and @entity16 have all ruled out the plan , making it impossible whoever wins next year 's @entity44 general election			1
in a speech tonight mr @entity15 released details of a letter from mr @entity8 , who spent a decade as a @entity49 commissioner , including four years as @entity21 until july this year			1
mr @entity8 insisted that any country which wants to join the @entity4 must be ' committed ' to the @entity51 of the @entity4			0
it means they must have the ' will and expected capacity to meet the convergence criteria of euro membership in due course ' as well as their own independent central bank			0
but if @entity3 is using the pound governed from @entity61 , it will not have control of bits own currency			0
mr @entity8 added : ' as to the question whether ' sterlingisation ' were compatible with @entity4 membership , the answer is that this would simply not be possible , since that would obviously imply a situation where the candidate country concerned would not have a monetary authority of its own and thus no necessary instruments of the @entity51			2
' @entity16 treasury minister @entity15 said the revelation meant an independent @entity3 would have to choose between ' using the pound like @entity18 uses the dollar , or joining the @entity4 ' the revelation from a senior eurocrat will be seized on by opponents of independence as proof @entity3 would be cut adrift from @entity49 if mr @entity5 goes it alone			1
in a speech to @entity84 this evening on @entity3 's place in the world , mr @entity15 said : ' no country has ever joined the @entity4 while using only the currency of another country at the point of accession			2
' today we learn that that option is incompatible with @entity94			0
' so an independent @entity3 would face a simple choice â€“ using the pound like @entity18 uses the dollar , or joining the @entity4			2
' it ca n't have both			0
this shows yet again the nationalists failure to put forward a credible currency plan and the dangers it poses to the people of @entity3			0
' first minister @entity5 , on a visit to the @entity106 in @entity107 , near @entity108 in @entity109 , said the latest polls were ' very encouraging ' the latest @entity112 poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the no campaign ahead of the independence referendum on september 18 the @entity118 campaign is now just six points behind in the battle for independence , suggesting @entity5 has the momentum it marks an escalation in the bitter row over the future of the @entity3 currency , with mr @entity5 toasting a ' very encouraging ' opinion poll which shows the gap between the @entity118 and no campaigns has narrowed to just six points			2
support for the @entity118 vote has surged following the first minister 's triumph in last week 's tv debate against former chancellor @entity136 , leader of the @entity137 campaign			0
the @entity112 survey for @entity140 and @entity141 showed 48 per cent plan to vote no , 42 per cent back the @entity118 campaign and 10 per cent remain undecided .			0
