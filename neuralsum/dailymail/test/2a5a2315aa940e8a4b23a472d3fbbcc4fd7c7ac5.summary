@entity0 has delivered a damning critique of the training - ground methods deployed at @entity3 by @entity4 and @entity5			1
the @entity7 winger claimed @entity8 had brought a brand of coaching and tactical preparation he felt was lacking under the previous management			1
@entity0 praised the impact the former @entity15 boss has made since his arrival on a short - term deal last month , with back - to - back wins having revived confidence ahead of saturday 's home meeting with @entity23 title - winners @entity21			1
@entity3 winger @entity0 is full of praise for the impact of new boss @entity8 @entity0 says that @entity8 's training ground methods are superior to the previous management 's ' for me , it 's a coaching thing , ' said @entity0 , assessing the changes under the new leadership			1
' we 're being coached more and , building up to games , we 're working on different formations , which players are going to play , movements , all different stuff , like most teams probably do			0
' for me , it has been great , every boy going into a game knows what they have to do , basically			2
' the tempo of training , the intensity , everything has been right up and it has been really enjoyable actually , but tough			2
that 's what we needed			2
' asked if that was not the case beforehand , @entity0 simply replied : ' no. ' pressed to expand , he added : ' i do n't think we were being coached the right way			1
we were n't going into games working on the stuff i think we should have been working on , which we are doing now and that is showing with the results			0
' we should probably still have won games that we did n't			0
but going into games knowing what you have to do does definitely help and i think that showed in the @entity61 game two weeks ago			2
' we changed the formation and shut out their midfield , their most creative part , and that showed with the result			0
they did n't create any chances - i do n't think @entity70 ( @entity71 ) had a save to make			0
that was just through working on things during the week			0
' former boss @entity4 was placed on garden leave last december with assistant @entity5 becoming caretaker manager			1
he then stepped down when @entity8 and @entity77 arrived			2
despite his unflattering assessment , @entity0 insisted he was not attacking the qualities of @entity4 or @entity5			1
' it 's not that i think it 's better coaching , ' said @entity0			1
' every coach has a different style			0
' the way we were going , we needed to work on things to get back to playing well and defending well			0
' we were gifting too many goals and i think that was just through not working on the back four or back three , whatever we were playing			0
i do n't think that he ' s a bad coach or anything , just that since the manager has come in we 've worked on stuff we had to work on			0
' @entity0 has singled out the change in formation and new - found intensity as behind the improvement			1

@entity3 winger @entity0 is full of praise for the impact of new boss @entity8
he feels that the new *regime* is far better than that under @entity4 and @entity5
@entity0 has singled out a new - found intensity and more astute tactics as reasons behind the *recent* *upturn* in fortunes at @entity7
*rangers* go into saturday 's game with @entity23 title - winners @entity21 off the back of two *consecutive* wins
