arriving at the store just ten minutes before the 12am opening time on november 28 last year , mr @entity0 , of @entity62 , @entity26 , managed to get to the front of the queuing throng - beating some shoppers who had waited for up to four hours			1
black plastic sheets covering a pallet of cheap tvs were still in place at 12.15am at the store in @entity72 , @entity26 , which led to shoppers becoming ‘ frustrated ’ and ‘ upset ’ , the court heard			1
mrs @entity15 had attended the @entity9 with her 30 - year - old daughter @entity87 to try to grab a bargain tv for her , while mr @entity0 had arrived with his mother , girlfriend and young child			1

she said : ‘ i put my hands out and around a box			0
i do n’t have use of my two thumbs			0

then as i looked up i saw the same gentleman who is here today			0
he could have had the tv but i could n’t let go because my arm was in the wiring			2
‘ i was saying " let go , i ca n’t let go of the tv , can you please let go ? " i was trying to pull the cord to release my arm			2
once my arm was released i felt sick and shaken			0
‘ somebody had gone to get frozen peas but an ambulance had already been called			0
’ mr @entity0 told the court that he had gone to another nearby @entity9 earlier in the evening but had moved on because it looked like they only had coffee machines on the pallet			1

i ’m sorry the lady ’s hand got caught			0
there was nothing i could do			0
everyone wanted to get a tv			2
timed to follow @entity164 , @entity8 was an all - american tradition marking the beginning of the @entity167 shopping rush			2
@entity59 stores have made the day a huge event , promising big short - term discounts to create excitement and queues outside shops			2

in 2008 , a @entity182 worker died after being crushed by frenzied customers at a @entity185 store			2
it is thought @entity8 , first brought to the @entity61 seven years ago by online retailer @entity187 , was so named as it is the day stores go ‘ into the black ’ financially			0
last november police chiefs appealed for calm after sales - crazed shoppers sparked a wave of disorder and violence			2

i thought i would get a tv quickly without people realising and she has seen me come up with a tv and thought " i will have that one "			0
there was nothing i could do			0
i ’m just a bargain hunter			0
' he added : ' after that i did n’t even go to the january sales			0
i ’m going to stop going to sales			0
i would rather pay full price because it ’s not worth it if this is what ends up happening			0
’ clearing mr @entity0 of wrongdoing , district judge @entity227 said : ‘ mrs @entity15 tried to get one or two tvs disappearing before her eyes , and did get her hand on a box - and unfortunately got her hand through the wires , because she thought that was the best way to hold on to it			1

i have to be satisfied that he went on not caring whether she was hurt or not - and i ca n’t be			0
