by @entity0 published : 17:19 est , 2 may 2012 updated : 06:49 est , 3 may 2012 the @entity2 governor sensationally admitted last night that he failed in his duty to help prevent ' the worst recession since the 1930s ' and the implosion of the @entity8 banking system			1
in a landmark speech , sir @entity9 said : ' so why , you might ask , did the @entity2 not do more to prevent the disaster ? we should have			1
' he admitted he bitterly regrets that he and his colleagues did not ' shout from the rooftops ' about the impending financial disaster – which continues to have crippling consequences for millions			0
limited powers : @entity2 governor @entity9 ( second from right ) in @entity21 on april 21 in the first radio broadcast by a @entity2 governor for more than 70 years , sir @entity9 said he had not been ' blind to what was going on ' in the run - up to the crisis , but failed to stop it			1
after reminding listeners the @entity2 was stripped of its power to regulate banks when @entity32 came to power in 1997 , he said : ' our power was limited to that of publishing reports and preaching sermons			1
' and we did preach sermons about the risks			0
but we did n't imagine the scale of the disaster that would occur			0
' with the benefit of hindsight , we should have shouted from the rooftops that a system had been built in which banks were too important to fail , that banks had grown too quickly and borrowed too much , and that so - called light - touch regulation had n't prevented any of this			0
' sir @entity9 , who was giving this year 's @entity53 @entity52 last night , expressed deep sympathy for victims of the crisis			1
he said the number of people searching for work has rocketed by ' over a million ' in @entity8 to 2.65million			1
' to many of you , this will seem deeply unfair , ' he said			0
' sir @entity9 also attacked some bankers , who continue to take bonuses while their firms ' share price collapses and dividends are scrapped or slashed			1
nearly £ 1,000billion of taxpayers ' money was used to prop up the banking system at the worst point of the crisis			2
though some institutions fell , he said ' almost all banks would have failed had not taxpayer support been extended '			0
he quoted the @entity78 , who asked a professor at the @entity80 : ' why did no one see this coming ? ' sir @entity9 said the answer was ' extremely simple ' , adding : ' no one believed it could happen			1
there was a failure of imagination to appreciate the scale of the fragilities and their potential consequences			0
' failed : the @entity2 and the @entity92 , in @entity93 , @entity94 ' no one could quite bring themselves to believe that in our modern financial system the biggest banks in the world could fall over			2
' in an interview on @entity104 's today programme this morning , sir @entity9 reinforced his protests that the @entity2 should not accept sole blame for the crisis and that it was a collective failure of a flawed system			1
he said : ' my main point was not to try and blame anyone			0
this was n’t the fault of a few bankers , a few politicians or even a few central banks			0
this was a failure of a system and i accept our share of responsibility in going along with a system of banking that failed			0
' he added that reform of regulation and the separation of powers away from one single body was key to averting a similar banking collapse in the future			2
he said : ' one of the big lessons from the crisis was that the idea of concentrating all kinds of regulation in one regulator did n’t work			2
and for very good reason which was the people running it were continually under pressure from press , politicians … to focus on things like consumer protection – the @entity150 crisis and so on			2
' and i do n’t think it makes sense to worry about the finances of banks in the same organisation as people are doing that kind of regulation			2
so it ’s being separated			0
and i think that ’s important			0
' i do n’t think any central bank or indeed any finance ministry or regulator feels that they ’ve come out well from this because something very wrong happened that ’s very clear			0
' what we can do and the only thing we can do now is make sure we learn the lessons			0
and i think in @entity8 we ’ve learned more lessons than most other countries			2
' epicentre : sir @entity9 said the banking crisis which rocked the @entity176 was the result of failings of bankers , politicians , and central banks sir @entity9 also used this follow up interview to his landmark speech to back the government 's ‘ textbook response ’ to the economic crisis - despite the @entity8 's slide back into recession			1
he blamed the spike in food and energy prices for growth stalling but in a boost for chancellor @entity195 insisted there were ‘ signs of a recovery ’			1
the @entity8 suffered a shock return to recession after official figures showed the economy shrank in the first quarter of this year , following a contraction in the final three months of 2011			1
@entity32 has claimed it is a recession ‘ made in @entity205 ’ , but sir @entity9 backed the coalition 's approach to tackling the budget deficit			1
‘ the strategy was that there would be a gradual move towards reducing the budget deficit over five years , that there would be an acceptance of the significant fall in sterling of 25per cent and there would be a rebalancing of the economy , ’ he said			2
‘ we had to rebalance our economy because we had a trade deficit			1
so this was an absolutely textbook response to the situation			0
‘ if it had not been for the squeeze on real take - home pay being exacerbated by the rise in energy and food prices then i think we would have seen some growth			1
’ he said there was a ‘ patchy picture ’ around the country but ‘ there are indeed signs of a recovery coming and we see that in the business surveys and i think also in the employment data ’			2
‘ so i think a reasonable view would be that we would start to see steady , slow recovery coming during the course of the year			2
’ flaws : regulators failures to deal with the banking sector 's increasingly risky deals helped cause the crash , the @entity2 governor sir @entity9 said explaining his claim there had been no unsustainable boom he told today : ‘ the speed at which the economy as a whole was growing was sustainable and the proof of that was that unemployment was basically constant and that inflation was low and very stable			1
‘ so there was no sign that the economy was growing too quickly in total or too slowly			0
‘ what was unsustainable was the balance within it			0
i have talked many times over the previous 10 years about the fact that we were building up a trade deficit , that this was leading to higher levels of consumption than could be sustained and that at some point this would have to come to an end			1
‘ but this was n't a problem that was unique to the @entity8 , this was a reflection of what was going on in the world economy as a whole			1
’ the new powers being given to the @entity2 , with the creation of the @entity283 and the restoration of the responsibility for regulating the sector , would mean problems could be targeted more effectively , he told today			1
he urged the government to introduce the @entity290 's proposals to ring - fence banks ' investment banking activities from their high street arms			0
sir @entity9 compared allowing the two to co-exist without some barrier between them to building ' nuclear power stations in densely populated areas '			1
investment banking activities should be kept far away from customers ' savings , current accounts and mortgages , he said			0
business leaders dashed hopes of quick recovery by predicting zero growth in the current april to june quarter of the year			0
however , the @entity309 forecast it would rise to 0.7 per cent in the third quarter followed by 0.5 per cent in the fourth quarter .			0

@entity2 governor said @entity32 stripped it of its power
he said people looking for work has rocketed by ' more than a million '
sir @entity9 blamed spike in energy and food prices for stalling recovery and pushing @entity8 back into recession
*spiraling* trade deficit and high levels of consumption were unsustainable during build up to crisis
but @entity2 now better equipped with more powers to tackle trouble spots in economy before a crash
