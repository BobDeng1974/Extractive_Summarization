@entity1 ’s court case against his former management company @entity2 lasted a total of 44 seconds on tuesday morning before proceedings were adjourned to see if the two warring sides can thrash out a settlement			1
mr justice @entity7 entered the courtroom a shade after 11am and stayed just long enough for @entity1 ’s senior counsel @entity10 to request a three - hour recess			1
‘ as you know the case is listed to last eight weeks and there are many issues between the two sides , ’ said @entity10 , @entity12 ’s former attorney general			0
‘ along with mr @entity19 ( senior counsel for @entity2 and its owner , @entity21 ) we would like to see if we can narrow many of these issues down and that we adjourn until 2pm			2
’ this was court - speak for the fact a breakthrough is believed to be close in the bitter 18 - month dispute and a settlement possible that would spare the world ’s no 1 golfer a prolonged spell on the witness stand			2
@entity1 arrives at the @entity32 in @entity33 ahead of the case involving his former agents @entity1 has sued @entity2 over a bitter row over the fees he was charged while he was with them @entity39 returned to @entity12 after winning the @entity40 on sunday i have it on decent authority that @entity1 offered € 10million ( almost £ 8m ) to settle out of court with @entity2 and its owner , @entity21 , and end what the world no 1 described himself as a ‘ tedious and nasty business ’			1
but @entity49 , with his reputation at stake , appears determined to have his day , or rather his several weeks , in court			0
in a nutshell , @entity2 believe they have a watertight contract entitling them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of @entity1 ’s endorsement money until 2017			1
given that @entity58 alone will pay @entity1 $ 100m over the duration , it ’s not hard to see why @entity49 is fighting tooth and nail			2

‘ @entity81 boys , ’ he said , with a grin on his face			0
the proceedings were held in the intimate setting of @entity84 , where there was little more than 50ft separating barristers sat at the back of the room from the presiding judge			0
from the public gallery , a few whispers could be heard as @entity1 entered the courtroom at 10.45am			2
at first , it was a struggle to find seats for his team , such were the amount of boxes containing court documents that were situated on one of the designated rows of seats			0
the sports management firm are also counter-suing @entity1 for £ 1.65m for severing his contract early some five minutes later @entity49 entered , looking far more tense			1
the difference between his body language and @entity1 ’s relaxed demeanour was stark			0
two minutes before the start silence descended , and there was a genuine sense of drama in the courtroom as mr @entity112 took his seat , only for it to be punctured almost immediately by @entity10 ’s request			0
@entity1 is suing @entity2 sports for being locked into what his legal team claims is an ‘ unconscionable ’ contract until 2017			1
