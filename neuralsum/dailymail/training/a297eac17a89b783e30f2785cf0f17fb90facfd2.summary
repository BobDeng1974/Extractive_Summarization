mixing alcohol with energy drinks to get a bigger hit could be more harmful than research currently suggests , claims a leading psychologist			1
clubbers who knock back vodka and drinks such as the massively popular @entity9 may have been falsely reassured by laboratory studies that do n’t reflect ‘ real world ’ use , says professor @entity13			0
he said concerns are growing about the harms that may arise from drinkers mixing alcohol and energy drinks which enable them to drink for longer and achieve ‘ higher levels of intoxication ’			1
be careful : a vodka and @entity9 is believed to be more harmful than first thought surveys show around three out of four college students in @entity26 and the @entity27 regularly indulge in such combinations			1
but the role played by energy drinks is under - researched and much of the work has only studied the effects of mixing low levels of alcohol with a single energy drink , said prof @entity13 , associate professor of psychology at @entity37 in @entity38			1
although some researchers have concluded ‘ we should not be concerned about the risks ’ , many of them have been funded by the makers of @entity9 , he said			0
at a recent conference in @entity38 , four out of five researchers who presented research on alcohol and energy drinks had received financial support from @entity9 , says prof @entity13 , writing in the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) ( must credit )			2
they had been given funds to attend international conferences or for research and all concluded there was no evidence showing a combination of energy drinks and alcohol increased drinking or harm			1
down in one ? the @entity61 is a popular energy mixer drink to have these days - yet it 's consequences are more negative than positive however , studies looking at statistical links between certain forms of behaviour and drinkers mixing energy drinks and alcohol show they are more likely to consume bigger quantities of alcohol , engage in aggressive acts , get injured and drink - drive			1
prof @entity13 said he was worried that research does not consider real world levels of consumption , because ethical concerns mean lab studies are restricted to testing the effects of a single alcoholic drink and a single energy drink - equivalent to a strong cup of coffee			2
however , about 40 per cent of people on city streets in @entity38 on friday and saturday nights are heavily intoxicated and nearly a quarter will have drunk more than two energy drinks , he said.current research has failed to prove the stimulant effect does n’t fuel intoxication and increase the risk of alcohol - related injuries and assaults , he said			2
but ‘ reassuring results ’ have come mainly from researchers giving talks at conferences where ‘ audience may not be aware of the extent of their industry sponsorship ’ , said prof @entity13			0
he said ‘ i am not implying a causal relationship here , simply an association			0
’ ‘ there are concerns about the role that @entity9 is playing , especially in supporting conference attendance of researchers whose findings and conclusions are favourable			0
‘ having the same speakers funded to attend conferences around the world by a company with strong financial interests raises questions of propriety and the presentation of research findings being used as a commercial marketing strategy ’ he added			0
only the independent researchers have argued that more studies are needed to assess the @entity125 said ‘ it is critical that the public can be confident in the findings of research on these products			0
conference organisers should require researchers working on energy drinks to declare whether they have received research funding or unrestricted grants , or financial support to attend meetings or conferences			2

mixing energy drinks with alcohol can lead to *violence* and intoxication
drinking these mixes lead to *prolonged* consumption and higher levels of intoxication
