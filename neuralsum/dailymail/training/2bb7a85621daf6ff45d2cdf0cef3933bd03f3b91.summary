the made in @entity5 star , 23 , tweeted a snap of her dazzling engagement ring by @entity8 on monday evening , with the touching caption : ' if i could scream loud enough for the whole world to hear i would			2
' her ring is made up of a typically large rock set on double bands encrusted with diamonds			2
earlier in the day the brunette had told her @entity19 followers that her beau whisked her away to ' her favourite restaurant in the whole wide world ' - in the famously romantic city of @entity24			1
engaged : @entity1 said yes to professor @entity2 's proposal on monday evening while on holiday in @entity24 the couple have been dating for over a year , after the 29 - year - old professor - real name @entity28 - became enamoured by the reality star when he saw her cover shoot for @entity31 two years ago			1
by the end of 2011 he had her number and they debuted their relationship at the @entity37 2012 ceremony			2

long haul : the couple have been dating for over a year @entity19 love : @entity1 shared her news on the social networking site happy days : professor @entity2 's reaction to the news - sorry @entity51 , he is off the market his response to her acceptance to his proposal on tuesday was just two words on @entity19 : ' happy days			1

@entity84 tweeted : ' congratulations to @ millsmackintosh and @ professorgreen on their engagement			0
; ) # @entity91 '			0
as the ceo of a jewellery company , his reference to the ring could suggest he may have helped the @entity2 in the selection process			1
@entity1 was far simpler with his excited message : ' @ professorgreen @ millsmackintosh congratulations guys ! ! ! ! @entity100 '			0
but it seems @entity1 and her new fianc√© may have overdone the celebrating somewhat , with the reality star tweeting on tuesday morning : ' wow ive got a little bit of a headache this morning ! # toomuchchampagne			0
' the pair also set tongues wagging when they shared a broody picture of themselves cooing over a friend 's baby over lunch			2

like any girl , i know i want a family one day , but i 'm really focused on work at the moment			0
' but @entity135 my dog has made me feel maternal			0
i love looking after people , but it 's a lot of responsibility			0
it 's like a little taste of having a first child			0
' professor @entity2 , who split from @entity143 actress @entity142 in november 2011 , admitted he had been seeing a lot of @entity1 before they made their public debut , but initially said he was n't looking for ' anything serious '			1
happy : @entity2 and @entity1 ( pictured here at this year 's @entity148 ) often share snaps of their relationship on @entity19 - and that even goes down to getting engaged loved up : the pair looked more than happy to pose up for photographers on the red carpet , with @entity1 even giving her beau a big kiss on the cheek at one point he told @entity162 newspaper : ' i do n't want to be too tied down or get into anything serious too fast			1
but @entity1 is really fit			0
' when @entity1 met @entity2 , she was overcoming heartache herself after she discovered her boyfriend @entity1 had cheated on her with best friend @entity1			1
but for the couple who have made no secret of their growing love for one another over @entity19 , it was a definite fitting place for their happy announcement			0
