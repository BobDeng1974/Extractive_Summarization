' they hate the way you walk , ’ begins the latest stupid adidas advert , ‘ they hate the way you talk ... ’ it ’s @entity11 time again , folks			1
oh , sure , the rest of the adidas roster is there , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 — but by focusing on the hatred top footballers receive , the spiel is plainly inspired by one man			0
shamelessly , adidas ’s posters at the @entity25 showed @entity11 , teeth bared , like a ferocious beast , and tried to make a selling point of his previous poor behaviour			1
they were hastily taken down when he bit an opponent for the third time in his career , and fans took to posing with the pictures as if putting their heads in a lion ’s mouth			0
@entity11 and @entity24 were mocked mercilessly , but deservedly			1
@entity11 ( centre ) is no stranger to controversy and has invited fans to ‘ bring on the hate ’ in a new advert @entity11 , surrounded by negative headlines , is portrayed as the ‘ @entity47 ’ as he poses and smiles here @entity11 was caught up in another moment of infamy when he bit @entity51 defender @entity50 last summer @entity16 stars in the advert as the @entity54 star poses with the words : ' there will be haters ' ‘ there will be haters , ’ is the latest campaign message			1
but not when @entity11 ( below ) just plays his football			1
last season , on the back of a brilliant and unsullied @entity66 season , @entity11 ’s fellow professionals made him their player of the year and the football writers did the same			2
he was universally praised for the performance that knocked @entity71 out of the @entity25 , too			2
then he bit @entity50 , got banned , and @entity72 were soundly beaten and eliminated in their next game by @entity74			1
so , in fact , people do n’t hate the way @entity11 walks and they do n’t hate the way he talks			2
they hate that he keeps biting people			0
and that adidas tries to sell its football boots off the back of this			0
adidas are launching their latest set of f50 , predator , nitrocharge and 11pro boots with the advert			0

@entity93 's @entity11 has invited his so *-* called haters to bring it on
but the stupid adidas advert is trying to make a selling point of his infamy
