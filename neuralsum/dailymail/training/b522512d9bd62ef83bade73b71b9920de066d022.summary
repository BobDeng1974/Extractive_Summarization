most of us know we should include fibre in our diet , but as a nation we simply do n't eat enough of it			2
despite its many health benefits , which include reduced risk of heart disease , type 2 diabetes and some cancers , our average daily intake of fibre is just 18g - a third lower than the recommended 25g			1
under proposals from the @entity15 ( who advise the government ) , this target is likely to rise to 30g			1
the trend for avoiding carbohydrates is n't helping , says dietitian @entity20 , a spokesperson for the @entity21			0
' i see lots of people cutting down on carbohydrate foods , such as wholemeal bread and pasta , in an attempt to lose weight , but they jeopardise their health and increase their risk of constipation and bowel conditions such as diverticulitis ( where the gut wall weakens ) if they do n't eat other fibre sources , ' she said			2
here we reveal some smart ways to sneak more fibre into your diet - you 'll need to choose between three and six items previously called ' roughage ' , dietary fibre is found in pulses ( half a tin of baked beans provides a third of your fibre intake ) , cereals , fruits , nuts and vegetables - but there is none in meat or animal products such as eggs			1
there are two types of fibre - insoluble and soluble - and both are needed to keep us healthy			2
' insoluble fibre makes food move through the digestive tract more quickly , preventing constipation and reducing the time toxins are in contact with the gut , which may reduce bowel cancer risk , ' says @entity20			0
soluble fibre dissolves inside the digestive tract where it forms a thick gel that helps slow the movement of sugars into your blood and reduces the absorption of cholesterol			0
high fibre diets are associated with trimmer waistlines - one theory is that fibre fills you up , while another is that some types can be partially digested by friendly gut bacteria , which in turn release chemicals that influence appetite			0
to get the recommended 25g of fibre can mean eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day , plus two slices of wholemeal bread and a portion each of high fibre breakfast cereal and wholewheat pasta			1
to take it to 30g , you 'd need to add a large jacket potato			0
that can be a daunting menu , so instead here are smart ways to sneak in more fibre - you 'll need to choose between three and six items from the list below to get the recommended daily intake of at least 25g ( and ideally 30g )			1
