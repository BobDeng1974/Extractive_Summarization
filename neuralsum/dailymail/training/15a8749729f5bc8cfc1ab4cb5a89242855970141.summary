riding the waves has been given a boost , literally , thanks to the latest electric - powered wakeboard			2
the @entity5 board is made of lightweight carbon fibre and travels at up to 25 knots ( 29mph or 46 km / h ) - meaning users do n't need a boat to get up to speed			1
the @entity11 designers unveiled the board at the @entity13 earlier this month and it is set to retail for € 15,000 ( £ 11,800 or $ 20,000 ) when it goes on sale next year			1
it features a salt - water jet propulsion system and is powered by lithium batteries			1
speed is controlled by a wireless remote and the current prototype can travel at speeds up to 25 knots ( 29mph or 46 km / h ) , but the firm said the final version is being designed to go faster founder and @entity11 wakeboarder @entity27 devised the electric - powered board in 2012 , while studying at @entity30			2
a prototype was developed , alongside partner @entity32 , and engineers @entity33 and @entity35 , and the first electric powered wakeboard was revealed in may 2014			0
the @entity5 board features a saltwater - resistant jet - propulsion system , and is powered by lithium batteries contained in a waterproof pocket			1
the whole board , including battery , weighs 64lb ( 29kg ) and the firm claims it is small enough to fit in a car or boat			0
battery life is currently around 30 minutes when travelling at full speed , but tests are being carried out to improve this the @entity5 whole board , including battery , weighs about 64lb ( 29kg ) and the firm claims it is small enough to fit in a car or boat			2

@entity5 , which is a portmanteau of @entity77 , is based @entity78 , @entity79 in the south of @entity11			2
the firm is carrying out further tests of the board before pre-orders begin later this year , and the device is due to go into production in early 2015			1
the @entity5 is not the first jet - powered board , @entity90 - based @entity89 produces its own electric motor that can be fitted to boards , for example , for € 13,600 ( £ 10,000 or $ 17,500 )			1
the @entity11 designers unveiled the board ( pictured ) at the @entity13 earlier this month and it is set to retail for € 15,000 ( £ 11,800 or $ 20,000 ) when it goes on sale next year			1

the @entity5 board has a wireless control , and is made of carbon fibre
it features a jet propulsion system and is powered by lithium batteries
the 64lb ( 29kg ) board reaches speeds of up to 30mph ( 46km )
@entity11 - designed board has a wireless control , and is made of carbon fibre
it is *undergoing* further tests before pre-orders will begin later this year
the board is expected to retail for € 15,000 ( £ 11,800 or $ 20,000 ) in early 2015
