judge @entity32 sentenced @entity1 to life imprisonment and ordered he serve at least 24 years before he can be considered for parole			1
judge @entity32 told @entity1 : ' you are an intelligent but devious and manipulative man			1
' there is indication of significant physical suffering before her death			2
you callously concealed her body in a suitcase			2
' i am entirely satisfied that your intention was to kill			2
there has been no flicker of remorse shown by you			2
' you have refused to participate in proceedings and have refused to come into the court , believing mistakenly that you could abort the trial thereby			2
' justice is not so easily thwarted			2
you have done your utmost to avoid conviction for her murder			2
' miss @entity15 's body was found at 10.30pm on september 17 , 1999 , the same night she was set to fly home to @entity60			2
@entity1 was captured on @entity22 lugging a heavy suitcase through @entity63 station and heading on a @entity65 train			1
two women discovered the suitcase at @entity10 and a security guard opened it to @entity70 's body curled up in a foetal position			0
she had been robbed of expensive jewellery and more than £ 40,000 she had been carrying			0
within hours of the grisly discovery , @entity1 fled to his native @entity12 after paying £ 457 cash for a one - way ticket at the same airport the next morning			1
miss @entity15 , a petite and attractive @entity78 - born @entity77 national , was only identified on monday september 19 , once friends in @entity28 and family in @entity77 had reported her missing			0
by the time officers visited the small flat in @entity84 , she had shared with @entity1 , a former airline steward , he had already fled			1
the tidy flat initially bore ' no sign of a struggle , let alone the sign of murder ' , but careful examination revealed blood - soaked carpet and smears on walls behind furniture			0
detectives travelled to @entity12 but quickly discovered there was no prospect of being able to extradite him back to the @entity20			0
he settled with his family in the town of @entity102 , but police continued to build their case against him			2
with new information provided by @entity107 he faced trial at a @entity12 court and was eventually sentenced to death			0

detectives began the first ever extradition bid from @entity114 in @entity20 history and in august last year @entity1 was arrested there			1
he remained ' indignant ' and insisted he had never travelled to @entity28 in his life , but was trapped when officers produced matching fingerprints taken from the @entity84 flat			0
he told a @entity107 officer ' you are going to have to give me a big apology '			0
he was returned to the @entity20 on september 8 last year , where he was arrested at the same airport where @entity70 's body had been dumped			0
legally aided @entity1 , who has had three firms of solicitors representing him , then sacked his barrister as the trial got underway and refused to attend court so the jury , unusually , did not hear prosecution or defence closing speeches			1
but @entity1 , who has since married and had two children , was in the dock as the @entity17 jury found him guilty of murder by a majority of 11 to one after just under two - and - a - half - hours			1
prosecutor @entity146 said : ' the long arm of @entity107 did not rest and leave matters there			0
' although years went by discreet efforts were made to keep tabs on @entity1 because it was hoped that somehow , at some point , the opportunity might present itself where by he could be brought to a court in @entity156 to face the charge of murder committed in @entity156			1
' scientists were able to link @entity1 's dna to semen found inside the dead woman 's body			1
miss @entity15 , an aspiring cabaret singer and dancer , was described as a ' holly - go - lightly ' character who had come to @entity28 to launch a career in showbusiness			0
mr @entity146 said : ' it is clear @entity15 was a vivacious , attractive young woman , who had a number of admirers			0
' she was a dancer and something of a night - owl			0
some of her admirers were extremely rich and generous to her			0
' miss @entity15 had rented the small flat from @entity1 's younger brother			1
she spent much of her time in the company of wealthy @entity177 men at some the city 's finest hotels , restaurants and clubs but @entity1 was ' neither rich nor seemed attractive to @entity15 '			1
in a victim impact statement , @entity182 , miss @entity15 's mother , said that ' nothing has changed - it is as though she died yesterday '			0
she said : ' at birthdays and other celebrations we are weeping			0
i have no more tears to shed			0
' i do not even know why the murderer did this or how he manages to sleep at night without feeling sorry			0
' you must impose the maximum sentence you can			0
