with their golden age behind them @entity0 get ready to go again on thursday night in @entity4 against @entity5 ’ @entity7 team			1
with @entity8 and @entity9 recently retired and the horror - show memories of losing to @entity11 and @entity12 in @entity13 still fresh in the mind can they rebuild in time to be a force at @entity17 2016 ? we answer some key questions			1
what is the mood like in their first game since the @entity25 failure ? melancholic			0
wednesday morning ’s papers were full of the team photos of the last @entity0 side that played in the @entity17			1
@entity29 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 all started in that crucial @entity25 qualifier that @entity0 won 1 - 0 last year but will not be on the pitch when the game kicks off on wednesday			1
@entity29 , @entity8 and @entity9 have all retired and will be impossible to replace			1
@entity30 ’s self - confessed dip in form and fitness will also create a huge problem if it continues because there are no central defenders on the horizon			0
group stage elimination was hard to take after winning three tournaments on the bounce and some all - time greats have since quit , but still if you look at @entity0 ’s proposed starting line - up you would probably say that eight of the 11 would walk into the @entity69 team			2
@entity70 , @entity71 and @entity72 might keep out @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75			2
but @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity50 would all make @entity54 ’s cut			0
so it ’s not all doom and gloom ; what ’s the grand plan ? @entity53 has the same dilemma he had before the @entity25			2
he does not want to betray the short - passing game that gave the team its unprecedented success but some of the team ’s most important players actually play a slightly more direct game			0
and he needs to recognise that			0
selection dilemma : @entity53 must decide who will fill the boots of @entity8 and @entity9 warm up : @entity0 's stars were put through their paces in a pre-match training session players such as ? centre - forward @entity50 , his @entity51 team - mate @entity81 , and his former @entity106 team - mates @entity79 and @entity107 all favour a slightly more direct approach			1
but @entity0 are not going to start playing like @entity51 or @entity106 ? there is still a big @entity111 influence with @entity30 , @entity76 , @entity112 and @entity80 integral , but @entity53 ca n’t watch videos of @entity81 setting - up @entity50 to score every weekend in the @entity114 and not want to incorporate that into his new @entity0 side			1
a big @entity111 presence still then , but also a big @entity118 ? very much so and if @entity73 ’ @entity25 form were to continue and he were to lose his @entity121 place then @entity0 would look to a new number one – probably @entity124 ’s @entity123			1
adding a @entity114 keeper to the names of @entity78 , @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity50 would mean almost half the team would be based in @entity69			0
competition : @entity124 goalkeeper @entity123 will be hoping to dislodge @entity121 's @entity73 down to the nuts and bolts then : what formation will @entity53 play ? who are the undroppables ? and where are the doubts ? it seems 4 - 3 - 3 will be system with @entity50 at centre - forward , @entity77 at centre - back and @entity80 in centre - midfield , the three players its hardest to see being left out			1
@entity82 and @entity75 are expected to play either side of the @entity51 centre - forward and @entity79 and @entity81 either side of @entity80			0
@entity112 and @entity146 will both need to come back into the equation when fit again			0
defensively @entity53 is desperately looking for alternatives to @entity30 and could try both @entity111 ’s @entity149 and @entity151 ’s @entity150 on wednesday			2
@entity78 and @entity76 will be pushed by @entity121 ’s @entity152 and @entity106 ’s @entity153 at full - back			0
and that just leaves @entity73 trying to get back to his best but under pressure from @entity157			2
will it be enough to see them reign again ? it will be enough to see them challenge again			0
matching the team that had @entity29 , @entity163 , @entity8 and @entity9 as its spine will be much more difficult .			1

@entity0 take on @entity166 in a friendly at the @entity17
@entity53 will be unable to call on the *services* of @entity9 , @entity8 and @entity29
@entity123 will be hoping to dislodge @entity73 as @entity0 's no 1
