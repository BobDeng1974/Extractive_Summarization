by @entity0 , political editor published : 12:51 est , 20 january 2013 updated : 03:28 est , 21 january 2013 former defence secretary @entity1 has seen the prime minister 's speech voters want a return to the @entity6 , one of the @entity8 's leading @entity9 told @entity10 yesterday today ahead of the prime minister 's long - awaited speech on @entity14 's future in the @entity15			1
former defence secretary @entity1 said @entity14 should be aiming to return to a ' basic economic relationship ' with @entity17 , which people backed in a referendum in 1975			1
dr @entity1 said he had seen the prime minister 's speech -- expected to be delivered on wednesday after being postponed because of the @entity22 hostage crisis -- and believed it would be an historic moment			1
' if that is the speech that is finally delivered , a great many of us will think that it 's a speech that we 've been waiting a long time for any prime minister to deliver , ' he said			1
mr @entity10 will promise , if re-elected with a majority , to renegotiate a looser , more trade - based relationship with the @entity15 and then hold an ' in / out ' referendum , expected to take place in 2017 or 2018			1
the prime minister is also expected to say that @entity14 now rejects the aim of ' ever closer union ' that was at the heart of the @entity15 's founding principles			1
however , mr @entity10 will stress that he wants @entity14 to remain as a strong voice at the heart of a reformed @entity15 - and will campaign for a ' yes ' vote in the referendum , as long as significant powers are returned			2
diplomats believe there will be an opportunity to demand repatriation in key areas in exchange for allowing the @entity51 countries to forge a closer economic and political union in response to the debt crisis on the continent			1
@entity56 and the @entity57 have so far rejected the idea of a referendum -- insisting that to announce one now risks damaging investment by creating uncertainty about @entity14 's future in the @entity15			2
that stance won surprise backing yesterday from @entity66 , who served as conservative defence secretary under @entity68 and was a notorious eurosceptic during his time in power			2
' to commit himself to an in / out referendum in the mid term of his next government seems to me to be extraordinarily dangerous , ' mr @entity66 told @entity79 's @entity78 programme			0
' people like to kick their government in the teeth			0
' prime minister @entity10 is expected to promise a negotiation on looser ties with @entity85 if he is re-elected foreign secretary @entity86 insisted there was a ' strong case ' for a referendum , saying ' fresh consent ' was necessary for @entity14 's membership of the @entity15			1
' we want to succeed in the @entity15 - we want an outward - looking @entity15 to succeed in the world , and for the @entity14 to succeed in that , ' he told the @entity97 's @entity96 programme			0
' but we have to recognise that the @entity15 has changed a lot since the referendum of 1975 and that there have been not only great achievements to the @entity15 's name but some things that have gone badly wrong , such as the euro			0
' dr @entity1 said he was ' broadly satisfied ' with the prime minister 's proposals			1
@entity108 leader @entity107 has ruled out any political links with the @entity8 ' i think ultimately there has to be an in / out referendum , because otherwise we 're going to have our politics in @entity14 constantly undermined by this debate			0
and i think it 's very important that we settle one way or another the @entity85 argument for a generation , ' he told the @entity97 's @entity120			1
' i would like to see us with a basic economic relationship , and i think , yes , i think that people in @entity14 voted in the 1975 referendum for a @entity6 , and that 's what we expected to be delivered			1
' i think certainly for myself , my preference would be to have a renegotiated relationship			1
[ but ] if we were put into a position where the @entity14 people did n't like any renegotiated solution and decided to be outside , a lot of countries do exist outside the @entity15			0
it would have undoubtedly some difficulties for us , but i do n't think they could not be overcome			0
' @entity135 , founder of the @entity137 group of around 120 @entity8 mps who have drawn up a shopping list of powers to be returned , said the party was ' hugely united '			0
she said most mps favoured a renegotiated relationship and that the number who wanted to leave the @entity15 come what may could be ' counted on the fingers of two hands '			2
@entity108 leader @entity107 said there was no prospect of his party , which saw its support slump in polls yesterday following news of mr @entity10 's plans , doing a deal with the conservatives despite the proposed @entity15 referendum			0
' i think with @entity10 as leader that is virtually impossible to even contemplate , ' he said			0
' mr @entity10 , whenever he 's asked about @entity108 , just throws abuse at us and calls us nutters and closet racists , so i do n't think there 's any prospect of us doing a deal with the @entity8 with mr @entity10 in charge			2
' on the chances of local deals with sympathetic @entity8 candidates , he said : ' it may happen but it 's not my priority			0
' shadow foreign secretary @entity174 insisted mr @entity10 's speech had ' more to do with the politics of the @entity8 ... than actually to do with the national interest '			0
' why has the speech been delayed for more than a year ? @entity10 i would suggest was actually rendered speechless because of the gap between what his backbenchers will tolerate and what @entity85 partners will give him			1
' shadow education secretary @entity183 threw @entity56 's position on a referendum into further confusion when he suggested the party would ' never ' rule one out			0
the outgoing @entity189 ambassador to @entity14 , @entity188 , said the relationship between our two countries ' could n't be any stronger ' and would not be affected by an @entity15 referendum			2
' this does not affect the special relationship			2
we believe in a strong @entity15 , we ca n't imagine a strong @entity15 without a vibrant partner in the @entity14 and that 's what we hope will come about but it 's up to the @entity14 people to decide what they want , ' he said .			0
