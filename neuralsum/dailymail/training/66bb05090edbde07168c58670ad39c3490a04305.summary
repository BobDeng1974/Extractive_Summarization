the @entity0 has been forced to ask the @entity1 for help as it hunts for a suspected @entity4 submarine believed to be lurking off the coast of @entity6			1
two @entity8 aircraft were this week drafted in to carry out patrols in the @entity10 in a bid to bridge the ' gaping chasm ' in @entity14 's anti-submarine capability			1
it comes after the @entity17 's £ 4bn fleet of ' spy - in - the - sky ' nimrod surveillance aircraft was controversially scrapped in 2010 , amid warning it would weaken @entity14 's defences			1
and @entity38 , the @entity39 's defence spokesman , said the deployment showed @entity14 had resorted to going to its allies with a ' begging bowl '			2
the @entity44 maritime patrol aeroplanes , which are currently based at @entity45 , were deployed on the trail of the mystery vessel this week			1
the crews worked alongside the @entity51 's anti-submarine frigate @entity49 , which has been operating off @entity6 for a month			1
the emergence of the @entity4 submarine is said to be linked to the alleged departure from @entity55 of one of the @entity51 's @entity58 nuclear submarines , which carries @entity60 missiles			1
the base , at @entity62 on the @entity63 , is the home of the @entity14 's ballistic missile submarines			1
@entity66 , a senior fellow of the @entity67 , told @entity68 : ' @entity49 is a capable platform and i have no doubt that her deployment alongside these @entity8 aircraft is related to the reported departure of a @entity77 ballistic missile submarine from @entity55 , and the countering of any @entity4 deployment from over the horizon			1
' the two @entity8 @entity44 maritime patrol aeroplanes were deployed to fill what defence experts described as a ' gaping chasm ' in @entity14 's anti-submarine capability ( stock image ) the @entity1 crews co-ordinated searches alongside the @entity51 's anti-submarine frigate @entity49 ( pictured ) , which has been operating off @entity6 for one month ( stock image ) but he added that @entity0 chiefs had been ' scratching their heads ' ever since @entity93 was scrapped , adding : ' it has left a gaping chasm in the @entity14 's capabilities and left us highly dependent on co-operation from our allies			1
' this week 's operation follows a deployment last month by maritime patrol aircraft from @entity103 , @entity104 and the @entity1 the periscope was sighted in waters where @entity14 submarines would normally surface as they head into or out of @entity55			1
on that occasion , it was also suggested that a suspected @entity4 submarine may have been trying to track one of @entity14 's four vanguard - class boats			2
sources said ' visits ' from @entity4 submarines were ' happening quite often ' off the north and west coasts of @entity6			0
some say the presence of the @entity4 submarine could be linked to the alleged departure of the @entity51 's @entity58 nuclear submarines ( pictured ) from @entity55 naval base ( stock image ) in october , @entity125 mounted a search for a suspected @entity4 submarine thought to be operating in its territorial waters			1
@entity125 closed off waters and airspace off @entity131 and warned the public to stay away after the military made three sightings of the mystery vessel			2
it also said it had picked up three encrypted signals from a suspected submarine it believed to be @entity4			0
one theory was that an experimental @entity4 mini-sub called the @entity142 had got into trouble on a spy mission in @entity125 waters			0
although the hunt was unsuccessful , defence officials said there was no doubt that their waters had been violated by a foreign power			0
@entity4 denied that any of its forces were involved			0
in november , the @entity51 tracked four @entity4 warships passing through the @entity155			0
on this occasion the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) said that the ships had been escorted out of @entity14 waters by @entity51 warship @entity159			2
@entity160 axed the @entity162 aerial surveillance planes in october 2010 as part of the @entity164			0
the @entity162 was intended to replace the @entity93 and would ensure that no foreign submarines could track @entity51 vessels coming in and out of @entity55			2
the @entity0 had signed a deal with @entity168 in 1996 to build 21 of the @entity93 planes , only for the contract to be reduced to 12 and then nine aircraft			2
the request for foreign assistance comes after the @entity17 's £ 4bn fleet of @entity93 surveillance aircraft ( pictured ) was controversially scrapped under @entity160 in 2010 ( stock image ) last month , patrol aircraft from four countries were deployed after a suspected @entity4 submarine was sighted at @entity55 ( pictured ) where is was allegedly tracking one of the @entity182 ( stock image ) at the point of being scrapped , the project was £ 789m over-budget and more than nine years late			1
the political move prompted criticism from top military figures and mps who warned it would weaken @entity14 's defences			1
even the then defence secretary @entity192 admitted the move was a ' risk ' , but ministers pressed on , claiming it would save the @entity0 £ 2billion			0
meanwhile , @entity198 leader @entity197 this week backed replacing the @entity60 nuclear weapons system with the ' least - cost deterrent ' possible			0
the submarine - based system is up for renewal in 2016 and the issue could be a key factor in any coalition deal after the may election			0
the current system involves four submarines , with one armed boat always at sea , operating out of @entity55			0
a spokesman for the @entity0 said : ' tough decisions had to be taken in order to rebalance the defence budget , which included removing the @entity93 from service			0
' however , maritime surveillance is provided through a combination of layered capabilities including surface ships , submarines , and air assets such as the @entity223 which searched for the missing yacht @entity225 in may			0
' the @entity14 continues to work closely with its @entity227 allies in the operation of @entity229			0

@entity1 @entity44 planes deployed this week on trail of mystery vessel
aircraft carrying out patrols alongside @entity237 , @entity49
@entity239 said to be linked to @entity77 submarine 's exit from @entity55 base
experts say planes bridge ' gaping chasm ' in @entity14 anti-submarine capability
@entity17 scrapped @entity93 in 2010 , amid warning it would weaken @entity14 defences
