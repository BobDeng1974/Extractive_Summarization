by @entity0 published : 06:38 est , 24 march 2012 updated : 06:38 est , 24 march 2012 @entity2 warning : @entity3 , editor of @entity4 , warned that patients will die because of healthcare reforms @entity10 's health services will be thrown into ' chaos ' by the government 's reforms and patients will die as a result , the editor of a prestigious medical journal warned today			1
the editor of the @entity4 , @entity3 , called for a concerted campaign to overturn the @entity18 , which finally completed its parliamentary passage this week			1
the government 's ' reckless ' move to introduce competition into the @entity23 will lead to a ' fragmentation and disintegration of services ' that will hurt those in need , he said			1
' we are about to see a phase of unprecedented chaos in our health services , ' he told the left - leaning @entity34 website			0
' those of us who opposed the @entity36 should not gloat as this confusion takes hold			0
' people will die thanks to the government 's decision to focus on competition rather than quality in healthcare			1
' the coming disaster puts even greater responsibility on us to overturn this destructive legislation and remove this undemocratic government			2
' the bitter 14 - month parliamentary battle over the coalition 's @entity23 reforms finally came to an end this week after the government comfortably fended off a desperate 11th hour attempt by @entity55 to delay the legislation			1
mps then approved the last amendments - leaving the way clear for @entity59 to be granted before @entity60 starts its @entity61 next week			2
the @entity23 shake - up has threatened to drive a wedge between the coalition partners ever since it was announced by @entity66 health secretary @entity65			0
it is intended to give gps greater control over @entity23 budgets , reduce bureaucracy , and increase patient choice			0
but furious opposition from professional bodies and @entity76 activists led prime minister @entity77 and deputy prime minister @entity78 to take the highly unusual step of ' pausing ' the legislation last year			0
despite accepting more than a thousand amendments - including limits on competition and private sector involvement - the government has failed to win over many health workers			2
health secretary @entity65 arrives to a @entity89 meeting in @entity90 on wednesday : his reforms finally passed through @entity60 this week in the same piece on the @entity34 site , dr @entity94 , a consultant radiologist and @entity97 member , complained about a ' failure ' of leadership by professional medical bodies who did not prevent the coalition proceeding with its shake - up			1
' early and united opposition would have seen off the @entity36 long ago , ' she said			0
' instead our leaders , in trade unions and professional bodies , saw ' opportunities ' and decided they could work with it on our behalf			0
' when they were finally persuaded to see the dangers , their policy changed to seeking " significant amendments " , despite the fact that the government showed no sign of conceding any			2

@entity3 calls for concerted effort to overturn the *provisions* of the @entity18
' people will die thanks to the government 's decision to focus on competition rather than quality , ' he warns
@entity130 finally passed this week after bitter 14 - month parliamentary battle and is *awaiting* @entity59
