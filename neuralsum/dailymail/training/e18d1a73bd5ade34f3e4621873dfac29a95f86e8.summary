about 60 rough sleepers have now set up camp there instead , mr @entity0 said he would try to curb ‘ benefit tourism ’ from the @entity3 as part of his renegotiation of @entity4 ’s membership ahead of a planned referendum in 2017			1
yesterday @entity35 migration experts suggested the number of @entity10 and @entity11 workers living in @entity4 may have increased by 30,000 compared - a rise of 25 per cent compared with the same period last year			1

the prime minister also repeated his view that future countries joining the @entity3 , such as @entity83 , should have to wait far longer before their citizens could come to the @entity4 to work			1
government sources have floated the idea in the past that ministers could try to impose an annual cap on @entity3 immigration - a move that would lead to a furious stand - off with @entity93			2
but mr @entity0 yesterday indicated that he had no plans to limit @entity3 migrant labour - the issue credited with driving support for @entity98			1

other @entity47 citizens come to work here			0

it is difficult to predict , but that would be the minimum you would expect			0
