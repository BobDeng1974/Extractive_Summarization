when @entity1 likened @entity2 to @entity4 legend @entity3 within a few minutes of his first international call - up in august , it did the @entity7 midfielder few favours			1
before he had even had the chance to anchor @entity11 ’s diamond – polishing his passes @entity3 style – he was injured			2
@entity1 ’s comparison had been much like an art teacher announcing to class that the new student was their very own @entity18 , only for him to snap his brush in the first lesson			2
@entity2 was excellent as @entity7 ended @entity23 's unbeaten start to the season at @entity25 the headlines and the hype – @entity28 proved popular – and the subsequent disappointment of the calf complaint which forced his withdrawal , did little for the player ’s confidence			1
upon his return to @entity25 , the early - season form which had won him @entity11 recognition stalled			0
he was n’t playing badly , but ‘ @entity2 , 6 : @entity40 and tidy ’ became the norm			2
but @entity42 boss @entity41 – and , evidently , @entity1 – had seen something more within the former @entity45 man , who quit the @entity46 for his hometown club in the summer			1
only now , however , is the wider audience taking note of the combative schemer who marries graft to his craft			0
it was the second time in 2014 that @entity2 had been on the winning side against @entity23 for @entity2 , having starred in saturday ’s 2 - 1 win against @entity23 , is now the only player to have enjoyed a @entity57 double over the @entity58 in 2014			1
he was at the heart of @entity45 ’s midfield in april when , at @entity62 , he and @entity61 out - fought and out - thought @entity63 and @entity64 in a 2 - 1 victory ; that was the last time @entity68 ’s side had been beaten in the league before the weekend			1
this time , he got the better of @entity70 and @entity71 and it was from his tackle , forward drive and incisive throughball that @entity75 poached his match - winning second			0
@entity2 had been outstanding throughout , reopening the debate about his @entity11 credentials			2
but those aspirations can wait			0
for now , he and @entity7 are quite happy changing people ’s perceptions			2
@entity75 scored twice in the second half as @entity7 inflicted @entity23 's first defeat this season ‘ we showed we can match it with the best , ’ said the 25 - year - old , who was part of the side beaten 4 - 0 at @entity87 in september to leave them bottom of the table			1
‘ to be the first team to beat @entity23 this season is a great achievement and we were deserving of it			2
it was tough at times but we showed our quality as well			0
‘ a lot of people will look at that result and will probably be shocked to see it			0
but we matched them and did n't give them too much respect , which if you do , can catch you out			0
’ @entity23 were without loss in 21 this term before their trip to @entity108 - and @entity2 rates @entity7 ’s success as greater than that of @entity45 last season			1
‘ they were strong in april when i beat them but they have added a lot more quality with @entity70 and @entity114 and @entity115 off the bench , ’ he said			0
@entity7 's midfield engine room of @entity118 and @entity2 share a smile with manager @entity41 ‘ they have quality all over the pitch and it is difficult to see a weakness			1
it is a bit different to last season			0
‘ going forward they are a lot stronger			0
defensively they have been strong as well and have brushed most teams away , so it was a fantastic win			0
’ @entity7 are up to seventh following their sixth win in eight and travel to an @entity135 side on saturday just one place ahead of them on goal difference			1
@entity2 , though , feels the @entity138 have laid down a marker with recent victories over @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 and the league leaders			0
‘ we go to @entity135 with confidence , ’ he said			1
‘ they are a similar team to @entity23 in the way they play and we have just got to settle it down like we did on saturday and we can be dangerous against any team			1
‘ i enjoyed it against @entity23			0
it is good to test yourself against the best team in the league and come out on top			0
’ forget talk of @entity3 , @entity2 is proving he is very much his own man right now			1
@entity2 's form this season could see him earn a second call - up to the @entity11 squad			1

@entity2 was excellent in @entity7 's 2 - 1 win against @entity23
@entity1 likened @entity2 to @entity4 legend @entity3 in the summer
the former @entity45 man has now beaten the @entity58 twice in 2014
@entity2 said beating @entity23 has given the players confidence ahead of saturday 's clash with @entity135 at the @entity170
