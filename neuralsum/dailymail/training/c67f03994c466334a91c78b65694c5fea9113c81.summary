forget global warming – the @entity3 may soon be plunged into a 250 - year cooling period , scientists have claimed			1
@entity6 climate experts believe that every 200 years the @entity8 ’s activity temporarily wanes and it emits less heat			1
they believe this ‘ cooling period ’ could cause the earth ’s average temperature to fall by several degrees			1
scientists believe that every 200 years the @entity8 emits less heat , resulting in a big freeze the last time this occurred was between 1650 and 1850 – a period known as the ‘ @entity18 ’			1
at the time , most of @entity21 ’s rivers would freeze over during the bitter winters			0
contemporary paintings show people could even cross the @entity25 using ice skates			0
the next ‘ cooling period ’ is scheduled to start between 2030 and 2040			1
but scientists from @entity29 in @entity30 think the cold period is unlikely to be as harsh as the last one			0
researcher @entity33 said : ‘ evidently , solar activity is on the decrease			2
‘ in this respect , we could be in for a cooling period that lasts 200 to 250 years			2
scientists at the @entity29 say the cooling period is unlikely to be as hash as the last one @entity21 may continue to experience harsh winters as the cooling period takes hold ‘ the period of low solar activity could start between 2030 and 2040 but it wo n’t be as pervasive as in the late 17th century			1
’ and @entity44 , from the @entity45 , said : ‘ there are no grounds to claim that global warming will continue till the end of this century			0
‘ climate moves in natural cycles of warmer and colder , as well as drier and more humid times			0
‘ early signs of cooling are already there and the trend may pick up in coming years			2
‘ human activity and industrial discharges do have a great impact on the environment , but forces of nature are far more powerful			0

@entity6 scientists believe the @entity8 emits less heat every 200 years
cooling period could cause @entity3 *'s* temperature to fall by several degrees
last time was between 1650 and 1850 , known as the ‘ @entity18 ’
the period of low solar activity could start between 2030 and 2040
