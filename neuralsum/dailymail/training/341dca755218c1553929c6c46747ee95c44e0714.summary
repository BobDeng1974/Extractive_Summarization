@entity0 want talks with @entity2 over defender @entity3			1
not content with taking @entity6 for £ 50m , the @entity5 champions have expressed interest in @entity8 , @entity9 and @entity10			1
yet they have @entity3 back on the agenda after realising @entity2 will not offer him a new contract just yet			2
the @entity15 defender , 30 , has two years left on his deal and is keen to tie himself to @entity17 until the end of his career			1
@entity5 fancy : @entity3 is wanted by big spending @entity0 amid uncertainty over his next contract however , @entity2 's policy now is similar to other big clubs , where they will only offer one - year extensions to players of 30 or above			1
that means any proposed talks will be shelved until next summer when @entity3 has 12 months remaining			0
the defender and his representatives wanted to add another two years to his deal supported by statistics that show he has averaged over 40 games a season for the past five years			0
@entity0 are willing to offer @entity3 that security and will bid around £ 15million for him should his relationship with @entity2 deteriorate			1
hair raising ! @entity0 have already lured @entity6 to @entity40 for a world record £ 50m for a defender bon voyage ? big spending @entity0 have also expressed an interest in @entity8 ( right ) and @entity9 ( left ) @entity46 still wanted by @entity47 and @entity48 @entity49 offered to @entity50 for £ 30m by @entity51 @entity52 is in the throes of lowering his squad 's age with the likes of 19 - year - old @entity57 due to arrive and tentative enquiries made for @entity60 's @entity59 , 21 , yet the coach recognises a need for experience if they are to win the big games			1
that has been reflected in their talks with @entity69 where they have discussed four players , notably 28 - year - old left back @entity73 , 28 - year - old centre back @entity74 plus free agent @entity75 , 33 , and @entity76 , 25			2
@entity3 is still a favourite with @entity52 but the club policy may force his departure			0
@entity81 have made contact over @entity84 defender @entity83 as @entity85 looks to strengthen his options at left back			1
@entity85 wanted @entity83 , 21 , when at @entity87 as a replacement for @entity89 and is now keen to take him to @entity90			2
top boyo ! @entity84 's @entity83 is on @entity81 's short list to become their next left back @entity94 has also been mentioned while @entity95 will be offered to top @entity97 sides over the coming weeks also			1
both are possibles for @entity100 if they fail to complete a deal for @entity102 from @entity103			0
@entity104 are waiting on @entity105 to decide his future after making a bid for the @entity109 defender			1
@entity110 are the main competition as they have matched the offer and look set to bring in some big names over the summer should owner @entity114 ratify his financial investment			0
@entity116 spark ! @entity117 's @entity105 , pictured battling against @entity118 , is wanted by @entity104 the 24 - year - old @entity105 has forged a strong reputation for himself in @entity120 with @entity50 having watched him in recent seasons too but @entity122 has taken the initiative			2
@entity124 are in talks over a move for former @entity128 and @entity129 defender @entity127			1
the 30 - year - old is a free agent after leaving @entity132 last month and also has an offer from @entity134			0
another former @entity128 player @entity135 is weighing up interest from @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 ahead of making his next move			0
the 31 - year - old is a free agent			0
flying @entity142 : @entity143 are interested in former @entity129 and @entity128 defender @entity127 meanwhile , @entity124 striker @entity145 , who spent last season on loan at @entity148 , is still in talks over a possible move to @entity151 with @entity153 favourites for the 22 - year - old			1
@entity155 want to take @entity156 back to @entity157			2
the 23 - year - old is eager to return to @entity159 after joining @entity87 from @entity160 in 2012			2
he failed to hold down a regular place under @entity85 and has been looking for a move in recent months			0
@entity51 showed some interest but they only want a loan with the club strapped for cash and that does not suit @entity87			0
return policy : @entity156 could be on his way back to @entity157 , with @entity155 and @entity51 interested @entity48 have expressed an interest in @entity172 's @entity171			1
the 28 - year - old has plenty of admirers with @entity176 and @entity177 particularly keen			0
they want the @entity15 to drop his wages to help facilitate a deal but the interesting new element is @entity48 who are understood to have contacted @entity171 's brother to sound out the possibilities			1
@entity171 is in the last year of his contract and is willing to move to play more games			0
in demand : @entity171 has attracted interest from @entity48 , @entity176 and @entity177 @entity172 have targeted @entity189 , have offers in for @entity191 and @entity192 and hope to sign @entity193 from @entity194 this week			1
a left back has not been a priority but they have considered @entity197 knowing @entity171 could go			1
the former @entity151 defender is a possible at @entity60 should @entity95 leave while there is the option of joining @entity172 's @entity202 franchise too			0
@entity172 will not countenance offers for @entity204			2
speculation is gathering momentum in @entity207 as they anticipate bids from either @entity47 or @entity60 for the @entity210			0
@entity211 reported earlier this year that @entity172 had made efforts to ensure @entity204 was well aware of how important he was to the club 's future and that has not changed			2
staying power : @entity172 will not entertain any offers from @entity47 or @entity60 for @entity204 the only way anything will change is if the player says he is no longer content at the @entity222			1
@entity172 did have an interest in @entity224 a year ago but that has changed and they do not intend to look at any mooted @entity47 proposals of a swap involving @entity224 plus cash			0
@entity60 present the greatest threat owing to location and their financial muscle but they are still contemplating a late offer for @entity233 too .			0
