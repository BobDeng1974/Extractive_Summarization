by @entity0 , royal correspondent and @entity2 getting better : the @entity3 walked unaided out of the @entity5 hospital this afternoon after being taken there for treatment last night only a day after being admitted to hospital for the first time in a decade , the @entity3 was yesterday well enough to go home			1
and far from spending the next week recuperating , as doctors have suggested , the @entity11 has learnt that she returned to work straight away			0
instead of heading back to @entity14 last night , the monarch , who turns 87 next month , insisted on returning to @entity15 to be briefed by her private office staff			1
she was joined by the 91 - year - old @entity17 , who had a public engagement at the @entity19 in @entity20 last night			1
and even though she is expected to return to @entity14 at some point this week , she will continue to receive the ‘ red boxes ’ of official paperwork that follow her wherever she goes			1
the monarch , who will celebrate the 60th anniversary of her coronation in june , went down with a debilitating case of gastoenteritis on friday and was advised to rest at @entity14 for the weekend			0
the @entity3 much prefers the relative informal nature of @entity14 to @entity15 and considers it to be her true ‘ home ’			1
but on sunday afternoon , concerned doctors decided she should be taken to king edward vii hospital for monitoring			0
and although @entity15 said she would be kept in for two days , her racing green @entity34 accompanied by four police outriders unexpectedly arrived outside the central @entity39 hospital yesterday lunchtime			1
@entity3 , who had earlier in the day been visited and given the all - clear by her personal physician , professor @entity41 , stepped briskly through the front door			1
wearing a pillar - box red coat with queen @entity45 ’s diamond bow brooch pinned to her left shoulder and her beloved pearls around her neck , the @entity3 had a sparkle in her eye and a spring in her step			1
the only possible sign of her treatment was a black glove on her left hand , which might have been to cover the tell - tale signs of an intravenous drip			2
the visit it is believed to have led to her being discharged it would be entirely routine for him to assess the @entity3 in this way , in addition to the care she is receiving from the private hospital 's own staff doctors monitored the @entity3 very closely before her exit			2
they were checking that the 86 - year - old was properly hydrated and monitoring her pulse and blood pressure exit : the smiling @entity3 left @entity90 this afternoon and thanked staff for their care over the past 24 hours going home : despite feeling very poorly over recent days her majesty showed she was in good spirits as she left hospital and got into her @entity34 ( right ) after warmly thanking the nursing staff for their care , she sped off without a glance at the waiting cameras			1
a few minutes later her standard rose at @entity15 , indicating that her first stop was her official @entity39 home			1
a source told the @entity11 : ‘ @entity3 will be staying at @entity15 overnight			2
’ she has cancelled her official engagements for the rest of the week , including a two - day trip to @entity109 , but it is anticipated that she will be well enough to undertake a number of official engagements scheduled for next week			1
it was only the fifth occasion in her six - decade reign that the @entity3 had been taken to hospital , where the @entity116 was treated for acute pregnancy - related sickness in december doctors have speculated that the @entity3 is suffering from norovirus , the winter vomiting bug that closes hundreds of hospital wards every year despite being allowed home the @entity3 's diary for this week would remain suspended , the @entity15 has confirmed her majesty did - ' reluctantly ' - agree to cancel her engagements for the next week , including a high - profile visit to @entity109 , which indicates that the stomach bug which struck on friday has taken its toll the first is the annual @entity130 multi-faith service at @entity131 in @entity39 on monday , which is followed by a reception held by the @entity134 secretary ‑ general at @entity135			1
she is also due to attend a service at the guards ’ chapel to commemorate the 175th anniversary of the @entity140 and @entity142 ’s @entity141 on thursday			0
a @entity15 spokesman said the @entity3 was in ‘ good spirits ’			2
she added : ‘ engagements cancelled or postponed this week remain so			1
next week we ’ll have to see , as she has only just been released from hospital			2
’ the queen has been hospitalised on only a handful of occasions during her six decades on the throne , the previous time being in december 2003 when she underwent surgery on her left knee			2
gastroenteritis is an infection of the stomach and bowel , the most common symptoms being vomiting and diarrhoea			2
visit : professor @entity41 , the @entity3 's physician , leaves king edward vii hospital on his scooter just before it was announced @entity3 was to return home the queen was being treated in the hospital where the @entity116 stayed just three months ago with severe morning sickness			1
tragically , a few days after the @entity116 was admitted to @entity90 in central @entity39 , a nurse committed suicide after a hoax phone call			2
@entity173 spoke to two djs from an @entity176 radio station – who were pretending to be the @entity3 and prince @entity178 – asking for an update of the @entity116 ’s condition and put them through to a nurse on her ward			0
@entity183 pranked : while the @entity116 , pictured outside the @entity90 , was treated for acute morning sickness it was subjected to a hoax - phone call which was blamed for a nurse 's suicide the 46 - year - old was found hanged in her living quarters after a recording of the conversation was broadcast worldwide			1
hospital staff have insisted the nurse was not reprimanded for taking the call , but sources close to the family claim she was ‘ ticked - off ’			0
senior managers were also accused of failing to support the devastated nurse after the prank because they were more concerned about the hospital ’s image			0
big protection : @entity204 and a colleague outside the hospital last night but the @entity3 ’s admission to the private hospital on sunday indicates it is still trusted by the @entity209			0
the @entity3 is the hospital ’s patron and in december 2003 , underwent an operation there to remove torn cartilage from her left knee			0
a night ’s stay reportedly costs £ 1,000 and each room has an en - suite bathroom and large flat - screen tv			0
the hospital says it recruits the highest - performing doctors in the country and claims to be so clean there has never been a case of @entity224 or c - difficile			0
the @entity3 can also take heart that @entity228 ’s tallest policeman is standing guard outside the hospital			0
at 7ft 2in , @entity231 , 26 , of the @entity232 , was among the officers manning the door			0
@entity235 , who has his uniform custom made and imports his size 17 shoes from @entity239 , said he was used to the attention his height attracted			0
he said : ‘ if i work in the @entity242 , i get anywhere between 100 and 500 requests for a photo			0
it ’s like being famous but without the money			0
