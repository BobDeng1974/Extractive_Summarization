our desire to create helpful digital assistants and self - driving vehicles could bring about our demise			0
professor @entity5 has again warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment			1
speaking at event in @entity13 , the physicist told the @entity14 that : ' the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race			1
' he argues that developments in digital personal assistants @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39 are merely symptoms of an it arms race which ' pale against what the coming decades will bring			2
' but professor @entity5 noted that other potential benefits of this technology could also be significant , with the potential to eradicate , war , disease and poverty			1
professor @entity5 made today 's claims at an event in @entity13 , during which he unveiled a new communications platform , designed by @entity54			1
the platform , called @entity56 ( @entity56 ) uses professor @entity5 's existing cheek sensor , which is detected by an infrared switch mounted onto his glasses			1
this helps him select a character on a computer			0
software is then used to learn from @entity64 and predict his next words			0
as a result , he types less than 20 per cent of the characters he would previously have had to type , making communication faster			2
this information is sent to his existing speech synthesizer so he can communicate to others			0
for example , to conduct a web search , professor @entity5 previously would have had to exit from his communication window , navigate a mouse to run the browser , navigate the mouse again to the search bar , and finally type the search text			1
this new system automates these steps			0
' looking further ahead , there are no fundamental limits to what can be achieved , ' continued professor @entity5			1
' there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains			2
' professor @entity5 made today 's claims at an event , during which he unveiled a new communications platform , designed by @entity54 , that will replace his current system			1
the platform called @entity56 ( @entity56 ) uses professor @entity5 's existing cheek sensor , which is detected by an infrared switch mounted onto his glasses			1
this helps him select a character on a computer			0
software from language technology experts @entity111 is then used to learn from @entity64 and predict his next characters and words			2
this means he can type 20 per cent fewer characters he would previously have had to type , making communication faster			2
this information is sent to his existing speech synthesizer so he can communicate to others through his laptop			0
for example , to conduct a web search , professor @entity5 previously had to exit from his communication window , navigate a mouse to run the browser , navigate the mouse again to the search bar and finally type the search text			1
this new system automates all of these steps			0
according to @entity54 , professor @entity5 's typing speed is twice as fast and his improvement in common tasks , such as easier , more accurate and faster browsing , editing , managing and navigating the web , emails and documents has increased ten-fold			1
this echoes claims he made earlier in the year when he said @entity30 ' would be the biggest event in human history , [ but ] unfortunately , it might also be the last			1
' he argues developments in personal assistants @entity37 ( pictured ) and @entity39 are symptoms of an it arms race that ' pale against what the coming decades will bring ' professor @entity5 made today 's claims at an event in @entity13 , during which he unveiled a new communications platform ( pictured ) that replaces his current system			1
the platform called @entity56 ( @entity56 ) uses professor @entity5 's existing cheek sensor to help double his typing speed professor @entity5 has a @entity157 related to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( @entity157 ) - a condition that has progressed over the years			1
this leaves him almost entirely paralysed			0
' medicine has not been able to cure me , so i rely on technology to help me communicate and live , ' said professor @entity5			1
' the development of this system has the potential to improve the lives of disabled people around the world and is leading the way in terms of human interaction and the ability to overcome communication boundaries that once stood in the way			1
' the platform has been three years in the making			2
earlier this year , @entity178 ( pictured ) similarly likened artificial intelligence to ' summoning the demon '			0
the @entity183 and @entity182 founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons earlier this year , @entity178 likened artificial intelligence to ' summoning the demon '			1
the @entity183 and @entity182 founder previously warned that the technology could someday be more harmful than nuclear weapons			1
and speaking at the @entity189 ( @entity189 ) @entity190 in october , @entity178 described artificial intelligence as our ' biggest existential threat '			0
he said : ' i think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence			0
if i had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is , it 's probably that			2
so we need to be very careful with artificial intelligence			0
' i 'm increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight , maybe at the national and international level , just to make sure that we do n't do something very foolish			0
' with artificial intelligence we 're summoning the demon			0
you know those stories where there 's the guy with the pentagram , and the holy water , and â€¦ he 's sure he can control the demon ? does n't work out			0
' in august , he warned that @entity30 could to do more harm than nuclear weapons			1
tweeting a recommendation for a book by @entity214 called @entity215 : paths , dangers , strategies that looks at a robot uprising , he wrote : ' we need to be super careful with @entity30			2
potentially more dangerous than nukes			0
' in a later tweet , @entity178 wrote : ' hope we 're not just the biological boot loader for digital superintelligence			0
unfortunately , that is increasingly probable			0
' mr @entity178 has previously claimed that a horrific ' terminator - like ' scenario could be created from research into artificial intelligence			0
the 42 - year - old is so worried , he is investing in @entity30 companies , not to make money , but to keep an eye on the technology in case it gets out of hand			1
in march , mr @entity178 made an investment @entity241 - based @entity30 group @entity239 , along with @entity242 and actor @entity243			2
in october 2013 , the company announced it had developed an algorithm that ' reliably ' solves modern @entity246 - the world 's most widely used test of a machine 's ability to act human .			2

professor @entity5 has warned that humanity faces an uncertain future as technology learns to think for itself and adapt to its environment
at a @entity13 event , physicist said : ' @entity30 may spell the end of the human race '
professor @entity5 was at an event to unveil a communication platform
the platform has doubled professor @entity5 's typing speed and improved his *productivity* ten-fold
