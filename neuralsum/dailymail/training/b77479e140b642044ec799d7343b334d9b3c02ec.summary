earlier this year , mysterious craters began to appear in @entity1 , sparking countless theories as to their origins			1
now scientists think they were caused by the explosion of gas underground			1
and the explanation could explain the loss of ships and aircraft in the controversial area known as the @entity12			2
scientists now claim that an underground gas explosion was to blame			1
they examined the largest crater and found evidence of gas hydrates			1
the theory could also explain why planes and boasts have vanished in the region known as the @entity12 three giant holes were spotted in the @entity24 and @entity25 peninsulas provoking claims that they were a man - made hoax , meteorites or even stray missiles			1
but now , after probing the largest of the craters , scientists said the they were most likely created by underground gas explosions			1
' heating from above the surface due to unusually warm climatic conditions , and from below , due to geological fault lines , led to a huge release of gas hydrates , ' reported @entity41 - citing scientists from the @entity42 and @entity43 in @entity44			1
@entity46 government agency @entity45 ( @entity47 ) said that foul weather and poor navigation are likely to blame for any mishaps in the area between @entity52 , @entity12 and @entity53			1
dozens of ships and planes have mysteriously vanished in the area			2
but @entity47 said the number of vehicles missing there is no different to elsewhere in the world - and the theory that some mysterious supernatural force is sinking boats and planes is a myth			1
' there is no evidence that mysterious disappearances occur with any greater frequency in the @entity12 than in any other large , well - traveled area of the ocean , ' the agency stated on its website in february			1
gas hydrates are ice - like forms of water containing gas molecules , notably methane			1
they exist in permafrost regions such as northern @entity1 , but also under the oceans in some parts of the world			2
' the main element - and this is our working theory to explain the @entity24 crater - was a release of gas hydrates , ' said scientist @entity90			1
' it turned out that there are gas hydrates both in the deep layer which on peninsula is several hundred metres down , and on the layer close to the surface			2
' there might be another factor , or factors , that could have provoked the air clap			0
each of the factors added up and gas exploded , leading to appearance of the crater			2
' he stressed that the crater is located on the intersection of two tectonic faults			0
yamal peninsula is seismically quiet , yet the area of the crater looked into had quite an active tectonic life			0
' that means that the temperature there was higher than usual , ' mr @entity90 said			0
crucially , recent warm summer weather has melted gases trapped in layers just below the surface			0
three giant holes ( one shown ) were spotted in the @entity24 and @entity25 peninsulas earlier this year provoking claims that they were a manmade hoax , meteorites or even stray missiles			2
but now after probing the largest of the craters , scientists say the theory that they were caused by explosions of gas underground is most likely @entity134 are @entity1 scientists working at the site			1
' heating from above the surface due to unusually warm climatic conditions , and from below , due to geological fault lines , led to a huge release of gas hydrates , ' reported @entity41 the explanation for the formation of this crater might also explain the disappearance of boats and planes in the area referred to as the @entity12 , according to the experts			1
the area stretches from the @entity151 in the @entity152 to the @entity154 coast , to @entity53			2
@entity156 scientist @entity155 , the deputy head of the @entity42 , said : ' there is a version that the @entity12 is a consequence of gas hydrates reactions			1
' they start to actively decompose with methane ice turning into gas			0
it happens in an avalanche - like way , like a nuclear reaction , producing huge amounts of gas			0
' that makes the ocean heat up and ships sink in its waters mixed with a huge proportion of gas			0
pictured is one of the @entity24 craters			0
it is in the area 's @entity181 district near the village of @entity184 and has a diameter of about 49ft ( 15 metres )			0
according to local residents , the hole formed on 27 september 2013 ' the same [ method ] leads to the air getting supersaturated with methane , which makes the atmosphere extremely turbulent and leads to aircraft crashes			0
' reporting the claims , the journal @entity194 in @entity1 dubbed the craters ' a distant relative of the @entity12 '			1
scientists conducted detailed research at the crater , including taking samples to a depth of 985ft ( 300 metres )			2
' we checked magnetic and radiation backgrounds , and found no abnormalities there , ' said @entity207 , chief engineer of a mission which lasted four days			0
mr @entity90 said that their theory will be studied further			0
' we all have to keep suggesting hypotheses and testing them , ' he said			0
' the crater itself is incredibly interesting from a scientific point of view			0
' the explanation for the formation of this crater might apparently also explain the disappearance of boats and planes in the so - called @entity12 region			1
the area , which is said to have ' swallowed ' boats , stretches from the @entity151 in the @entity152 to the @entity154 coast , to @entity53 ( shown ) this first giant crater , shown , measured around 262ft ( 80 metres ) and was found in far northern @entity1			1
it is believed to have been caused by rising temperatures and a gas explosion in the area he added there was a need to identify other areas in the world where such underground gas explosions can occur			1
' we must also pay attention to areas where the same thing might potentially happen , ' he said			0
mr @entity207 also revealed that security concerns meant the research team were not allowed to go inside the crater which is around 230ft ( 70 metres ) deep			0
' there was a great temptation to go down the crater , but the @entity42 did n't give the go ahead , saying it was too risky , ' he said			0
the crater they studied is in the @entity248 , some 19 miles ( 30km ) from the @entity250 gas field			2
the original crater was found in the @entity24 , baffling scientists , before two further craters were found in the @entity181 district and @entity255 this third crater is in the @entity255 and was accidentally discovered by reindeer herders who almost fell into it , in the vicinity of the remote outpost of @entity262			2
the funnel is a perfectly formed cone , said locals who are mystified over its formation			0
its depth is estimated at between 200 to 330ft ( 60 to 100 metres )			0

earlier this year , mysterious giant craters appeared in @entity1
and now scientists claim an underground gas explosion was to blame
they examined the largest crater and found evidence of gas hydrates
theory could also explain why planes and boasts have vanished in the region known as the @entity12
this is a hypothesised region on the west of the @entity152
many , including the @entity47 , claim its existence is a myth
