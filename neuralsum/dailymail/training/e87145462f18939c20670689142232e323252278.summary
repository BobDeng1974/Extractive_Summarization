by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 14:38 est , 14 november 2013 updated : 03:37 est , 15 november 2013 the princess royal has suggested @entity3 should consider eating horse meat – because it would improve standards of care for the animals			1
princess @entity9 said those in the trade ‘ value their horses and look after them well ’			1
she added : ‘ should we be considering a real market for horse meat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases if there was a real value in the horse meat sector ? ’ princess @entity9 has suggested people in @entity3 should consider eating horse meat as it would help to improve the welfare of the animals			1
above , the royal with a horse , @entity29 , she rehomed last month rescue centres have seen a rise of up to 40 per cent in admissions since it was revealed in january that some supermarket food labelled as beef contained horse			2
experts say there are owners who let their horses breed indiscriminately then become overwhelmed with the numbers produced			1
but whereas the unwanted horses might once have gone to the meat trade , now their owners abandon them rather than pay up to £ 100 a week to care for and feed them			1
speaking at the annual conference of the @entity46 charity in @entity47 yesterday , the former eventing champion said owners might take better care of their horses when they were alive if they thought they could later sell them for meat			1
her comments come after the scandal in january when it emerged horse meat was present in products from a number of @entity3 supermarkets including @entity59 , @entity60 and @entity61			2
it was later revealed that horses from countries such as @entity65 were being slaughtered after suffering appalling cruelty and then shipped into the @entity3 as beef products			2
the princess royal , who is president of the charity , told the @entity70 : ' our attitudes to the horse meat trade and the value of horse meat may have to change			1
' animal charities around the country have warned of a horse welfare crisis , with around 7,000 of them at risk of neglect and abandonment			2
the royal cited @entity84 as an example of a country that does properly care for the animals - adding that it was only when they were destined for consumption and transported alive in trucks that they suffered neglect			1
and in some cases , they entered the @entity3 food chain			0
she said : ' if that is true then , and they value their horses and they look after them well because they are in the horse meat trade , should we be considering a real market for horse meat and would that reduce the number of welfare cases ? ' we have to understand if value has a part to play in how we reduce welfare cases … if it has real financial value then you look a little bit further ahead in the way you look after your animals			1
' following the horse meat fiasco , questions were raised over the merits of eating horse in @entity3			2
former eventing champion @entity9 ( seen here in 1987 ) said owners might take better care of their horses when they were alive if they thought they could later sell them for meat some countries , such as @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity130 , already eat large amounts of it			1
the princess added that part of the problem was how the public had been misled			0
she said that retailers should have corrected the labels on the products before putting them back on the shelves			0
the purpose of the annual conference at the @entity143 was to debate the future of horses over the next 100 years			1

the @entity155 is now helping the princess herd sheep and hack her 200 acres of woodland			0
it marks a dramatic change in fortunes for @entity29 , who came to the charity three years ago when her owners were no longer able to care for her			1
' she 's perfect for me , ' said @entity9			0
' she 's 14 and she 's not wanting to be too ambitious and i do n't want to be very ambitious either			0
' she will be a really useful nanny - i have young stock			0
' the princess added : ' she fits in really well and as far as i 'm concerned i was really glad they did n't find someone else for her			0
she is just the size of horse that i could do with now			0
' living here and going across the farm i like to get off relatively easily and needed a horse that was reasonably reliable when it comes to rural activities			0
