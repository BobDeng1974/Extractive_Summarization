a year earlier , the mother - of - two was left humiliated after a roller coaster at @entity32 in the @entity33 stopped while she was on it			1
she said : ' we were at @entity32 in the summer of 2012			2
the ride got stopped as my bars were not locked			2
i was too big and had to leave the ride			2
' she added : ' the ride made me more humiliated and devastated about my weight			1
that was a huge catalyst			2
' @entity5 was n't allowed on some @entity25 rides in @entity26 , in 2013 because of her size ( @entity5 pictured before weight loss ) @entity5 has always dreamed of skydiving , but was told that 13st was the maximum weight to take part but the biggest game changer for @entity5 , who is mother to @entity52 , 14 , and @entity53 , 11 , was when her excess weight stopped her from following her dreams			1
she said : ' i 'd always wanted to do a skydive			2
it was my life ambition to do one			0
but when i looked into it , i found out you need to be up to 13 stone to take part			2
' it was then that @entity5 finally decided to battle her weight problems			1
after her gp prescribed her with a gym membership , @entity5 started to rapidly shed body fat			1
she has now lost 13 stone in less than two years and now tipped the scales at 13st 1lb			1

' my confidence has tripled and i can now play with my kids and enjoy myself more			0
it has given me another life			0
' the support from my family has been great as well			0
they have been a massive part of it			0
i do n't think i would have been able to do it without my boys			0
' @entity5 's weight loss was thanks in part to a new gym membership prescribed to her by her gp after reaching the acceptable weight , @entity5 has booked her skydive for may 16 after reaching the acceptable weight , @entity5 has now booked her skydive and has chosen to donate the proceeds to the @entity95 , which provided care for her mother @entity97 , who passed away in 2009 from heart failure at the age of 66			1
the event will take place on may 16 , just three days before what would have been her mother 's birthday			0
