while @entity2 and @entity3 promote their curved handsets with bendable displays , rival @entity0 appears to have been silently working on the next stage in flexible technology			1
a patent , originally filed in march , has come to light this week suggesting the @entity11 firm is working on foldable batteries			1
it describes a battery pack made up of ‘ foldable cells ’ that can curve and bend with the shape of a phone , as well as being capable of folding in on itself			1
@entity0 's patent describes a battery pack made up of ' foldable cells ' , pictured , that can curve and bend with the shape of a phone			1
the technology could also be capable of folding in on itself , meaning it fits into smaller , tighter spaces and is more suited to wearable technology , designed to move with a person 's body aside from being bendy , the technology also has the benefit of being able to be made smaller			2
this means it could fit into places within a phone ’s circuit that other solid , and even bendable , batteries ca n’t			0
this could lead to super-thin devices , or advancements in batteries used in wearable technology designed to curve and move with a person ’s body			2
according to @entity0 ’s patent : ‘ portable electronic devices are made with consistently smaller form factors			1
‘ even though the internal components are becoming smaller and smaller , batteries generally lag behind other technological advancements , consistently consuming a large portion of the portable electronic device			2
@entity0 recently unveiled its @entity54 phone , pictured left , and the @entity57 tablet , pictured right			2
based on the details filed in the patent , future @entity0 devices could be curved , similar to @entity2 's @entity62 phone , be super-thin , or could fold in themselves it continues that batteries tend to take on ‘ rectangular box - type ’ forms and this means phones have to be equally rectangular in shape to maximise the use of space			1
‘ in current portable electronic devices , to have a curved and aesthetically pleasing form factor , space is generally wasted between the battery and a case making the portable electronic device seem larger and a result may be less appealing , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ additionally , there may also be wasted space between the internal components and the case and / or between certain internal components			0
’ the technology behind the plans , including what the cells would be made of and how exactly they would fit together , was not fully explained in the patent			1
@entity2 's @entity62 phone , pictured , was launched in october with a self - healing case			0
@entity90 firm @entity89 also makes a similar technology called @entity92			0
@entity89 's coating is made from polymer - alloy it is not the first battery capable of changing its shape , however			0
@entity99 , the research arm of the @entity101 phone maker @entity2 , unveiled its curved battery design earlier this year			0
@entity99 used thin strands of copper wire , coated with nickel - tin , which are then spun into a ' metal yarn ' and wrapped around a rod			0
the rod is then removed , leaving a strong spring which can be tucked into tight and small spaces			0
the team said : ' in our experiments we found that our prototype was exceptionally ﬂexible and could suffer large strain without malfunction			0
' they agreed with @entity0 and said that when designing new devices , ' the limiting factor is often the shape of the battery ' and that their battery could be ' a disruptive technology that could open up a path for design innovation			2

@entity0 ’s patent application , filed originally in march , is called ‘ @entity129 ’
it describes a battery made of a *series* of cells that can be folded together
this battery could be made bigger or smaller depending on the handset
the technology could lead to super-thin handsets , or phones that *collapse*
