president @entity0 has named @entity2 political operative and loyal party donor @entity3 as his ' ebola czar ' an administration source confirmed on friday			1
@entity3 , a lawyer and former @entity7 clerk , was part of the team that helped the president prepare for his debates during the 2008 election cycle			2
he served as chief of staff to vice president @entity14 until 2011 and served the same role for vice president @entity16 during the 1990s			1

@entity35 portrayed him in the @entity59 movie ' recount ' ; in the later film ' outbreak , ' his character dies of @entity39			1
@entity63 @entity62 rep. @entity62 , who chairs the @entity64 , issued a scathing statement on friday			0
' i have to ask why the president did n’t pick an individual with a noteworthy infectious disease or public health background ? ' @entity72 sen. @entity71 , a @entity62 whose state has been ground zero for @entity39 in the @entity30 , said @entity30 ' do n't need another so - called " czar " ; we need presidential leadership			1
' @entity3 's published biographies indicate nothing in his professional history related to medicine or public health			1
in 2009 the @entity0 @entity32 tapped him to supervise the allocation of money tied to the president 's ill - fated economic stimulus package			0
this year when @entity32 press secretary @entity86 retired , @entity3 boasted on @entity87 that he was ' the person who hired ' him			1
the president 's choice of @entity39 quarterback indicates the @entity32 's need for a strong manager , not necessarily another epidemiologist to cross swords with dr. @entity42 , the embattled director of the @entity43			0
following an @entity39 meeting at the @entity32 on thursday , @entity0 conceded that ' it may make sense for us to have one person ' to coordinate the administration 's @entity39 response efforts			1
that way , he added , ' after this initial surge of activity , we can have a more regular process just to make sure that we 're crossing all the @entity107 's and dotting all the i 's going forward			0
' @entity32 homeland security adviser @entity109 had been acting as @entity0 's @entity39 coordinator , but the president said she and national security adviser @entity112 were stretched too thin to devote time and attention to @entity39			1
loyal @entity115 : portions of @entity3 's @entity87 feed are a tribute to political initiatives on the left mocking : reactions online ranged from congratulatory ( from @entity2 operatives ) to desultory ( from scientists ) @entity124 first broke the news that @entity3 would be named to the point - person job dealing with the @entity30 ' new exposure to the ebola virus			2
the decision suggests that the @entity32 is more interested in putting out political fires and protecting the president than in coordinating the government 's public health infrastructure in a time of crisis			2

' punches are good , counterpunches are better , ' he wrote then			0
it may be too late for @entity0 to take advantage of another @entity3 nostrum : ' while you can lose a debate any time , you can only win it in the first 30 minutes			2

he is an excellent choice			0
@entity163 @entity162 rep. @entity162 disagreed			0
' president @entity0 will name political operative @entity3 as # @entity165 , ' he tweeted			1
