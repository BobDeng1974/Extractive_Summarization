a three - year - old girl almost died after her family 's cat gave her a rare form of meningitis			1
@entity5 was left just hours from death after she contracted meningitis from @entity8 , her mother 's two - year - old pet			1
thankfully , after a month in hospital , @entity5 made a full recovery and she is now inseparable from the animal			1
@entity5 , three , caught meningitis from her mother 's pet cat , @entity8 ( pictured ) @entity5 's mother @entity18 - @entity17 , 21 , a promotions assistant from @entity19 , @entity20 , said : ‘ it seemed such an unlikely cause			1
‘ the doctors said she was only the 39th person in the world known to have picked up that particular strain of meningitis			2
‘ she was just three weeks old and very vulnerable			0
‘ @entity8 still lives with my mum and there 's no need to worry about them being in contact any more			1
in fact they follow each other around all the time when we visit			0
’ @entity38 ( pictured with her mother , @entity18 ) fell ill when she was just three weeks old			1
she cried constantly and was hot and bad - tempered so her mother took her to hospital where she was diagnosed with meningitis when she was diagnosed , doctors said that @entity5 was just hours from death			1
she had to spend a month in hospital before being released			0
she is pictured recovering from the illness miss @entity17 said she became concerned when , at three weeks old , @entity38 would not stop crying			2
she said : ‘ i tried everything to calm her down , but she would n't stop yelling			0
she was extremely hot and bad - tempered			2
a fever and cold hands and feet refusing food and vomiting being fretful and disliking being handled drowsiness and unresponsiveness an unusual cry or moaning neck stiffness and a dislike of bright lights pale , blotchy skin or a red rash that does not disappear under pressure seizures or fits source : the @entity64 ‘ after a few hours i decided to trust my mothers ' instinct and take her to hospital			0
’ at @entity71 , in @entity72 , doctors took her daughter away for some emergency tests			0
she said : ‘ it broke my heart to see her hooked up to so many wires			0
when they told me she had meningitis , i felt sick			0
‘ it did n't make any sense - @entity38 did n't have a rash and i had n't noticed her shying away from bright lights			0
‘ she had an extremely rare form – i was told there had been just 39 cases previously , which really took me by surprise			1
‘ i was told that she could have died within hours if i had n't brought her in			0
’ as doctors brought @entity5 out of the danger zone , they made the startling revelation that they had traced the source of her meningitis to @entity8 the cat			1
@entity5 had contracted a dangerous viral strain of the illness called pasteurella multocida			1
this bacterium is common in animals , including cats and dogs and can be transferred to humans through bites , scratches and saliva			0
@entity5 was lucky to make a full recovery from her illness and is now a healthy three year old it is believed the cat must have licked @entity38 's bottle and that she contracted the illness as a result of bacteria in the cat 's saliva however , it is extremely rare for it to cause meningitis			1
a spokesperson for the @entity122 said : ' meningitis can be caused by organisms such as bacteria , viruses or fungi infecting the fluid which surrounds the brain and spinal cord			2
' most feline infectious diseases only affect cats whilst most human infectious diseases only affect humans			0
it is possible but rare for certain diseases to pass between cats and humans , for instance if a cat bites you or licks an open wound you could get an infection			2
last month @entity144 , 19 , revealed she had caught @entity145 while cleaning an open wound on her pet cat , @entity148 cases of meningitis resulting from an infection passed on from a cat are extremely rare indeed			1
' miss @entity17 said : ‘ they thought that it was transferred through @entity8 's saliva			1
i 'd been careful not to leave them alone together , but @entity8 must have licked @entity38 's milk bottle while my back was turned			1
‘ i was consumed with guilt - i felt as if i had n't kept a careful enough eye on things , and that @entity38 's sickness was my fault			2
i sent @entity8 to go and live with my mother			2
’ after a month in hospital , @entity5 came home and has since gone on to make a full recovery			1
she is now a happy , healthy toddler who is unafraid of animals			0
a spokesperson for the charity @entity170 told @entity171 : ' it is possible to contract meningitis from cats but it is very , very rare , so people should n’t worry unduly about contracting it in this way			2
' our advice would be to keep your family pet and make sure you know the signs and symptoms of meningitis			1
' take prompt action if you suspect the disease			0
among the symptoms to look out for in babies and toddlers are fever , with cold hands and feet ; a stiff neck and a dislike of bright lights ; an unusual cry or moaning ; and being drowsy , floppy or unresponsive			0
' miss @entity17 added : ‘ i 've been told it 's perfectly safe for @entity5 to spend time with @entity8 , which is a relief because they 've really become best friends			1
’ last month , a 19 - year - old girl revealed she had caught @entity145 from her pet kitten			1
@entity144 , from @entity208 , is thought to be the first case of cat - to - human transmission			2
experts believe she became infected while cleaning her pet 's open wound and she had to be rushed to hospital for surgery on severely her damaged lungs			2
she is now keen to advise new parents to research early symptoms of meningitis in children , which include pain , mottled skin and unusually cold hands and feet or shivering			0
the cat now lives with @entity5 's grandmother but the pair are allowed contact as the danger has passed she said : ‘ i did n't know very much about meningitis - i always thought the only thing i should be worried about was a rash			1
‘ but there are lots of other symptoms too , and knowing them can make all the difference in helping to catch it early			0
‘ i try not to think about how close i came to losing @entity38			0
i 'm so grateful that she 's alright now			0
