by @entity0 published : 04:27 est , 28 november 2013 updated : 06:41 est , 28 november 2013 the pensions minister , @entity1 , said new caps on the rates company management funds can charge customers will ensure ' value for money ' the pensions minister today said new regulations on the rate providers can charge customers will prevent people from being ' ripped off ' by expensive fund management fees			1
@entity1 insisted the department was eager to ensure people were receiving ' value for money ' with company pension funds by implementing a 0.75 per cent cap on management fees			1
he however did not reveal whether the new regulations which are to come into place in april will apply to people already paying in to private schemes			0
speaking to @entity23 's @entity22 , the minister said : ' a few percentage points here and there can add up to big money			0
' we want to ensure people are getting value for money			1
it 's not just about cost but making sure no one is ripped off			0
' equally however we do n't want to drive charges so low that people can no longer get a quality product			2
' when asked whether those already paying in to managed pension funds would be subject to the same caps , the minister merely said the department was ' looking at a number of options '			0
' we 're gathering a lot of data on old schemes and seeing what the impact would be there			0
' pensions expert @entity51 said however customers had to pay more to receive better management on their investments			1
' you ca n't expect people to manage funds for free			0
' if we want innovation and more imaginative investment rather than relying on passive management , which effectively uses a computer to select the right stocks to invest in , we do need to allow some extra charges			2
' everything you do in pensions is risky whether it ’s by a computer or in a fund manager			0
there are always going to be risks			0
' leading company @entity70 have said the proposed 0.75 per cent cap is too high and could lead to customers paying fund managers over £ 4billion too much under new @entity76 proposals , pension management companies could be forced to limit fund fees to 0.75 per cent			1
but , how much have those paying in already lost to hidden charges ? figures published by the @entity81 last month revealed that a person paying 0.5 per cent in annual management charges lost 13 per cent of their savings to company fees			1
a customer who pays just one per cent lost almost a quarter of their savings , while someone paying one and a half per cent in annual management charges lost more than a third			1
ms @entity51 however added : ' we are missing a much bigger element though and that what happens on the way in when people buy annuities			0
' as it stands there are no controls on how much you can be charged for buying a product , and as much as three and a half per cent of people 's pensions are lost when buying annuities			2
' the pensions minister did not reveal whether caps on the rate of annuity charges would be introduced , but said the recently proposed plans were part of a necessary ' market shake up '			2
leading pensions provider @entity70 have hit out against the department 's proposed cap rate , suggesting 0.75 per cent is too high and will lead to people pouring too much money into fund managers ' pockets			1
the company has estimated customers would pay over £ 4billion too much if a 0.75 cap is introduced , instead suggesting limits should be set at the lower end of the scale			1
today marks the end of a consultation period , after which the government will decide which course of action to take .			0
