her body has never been found			2
however , there now hope for a prosecution in the case after black last year lost an appeal against his latest conviction for the murder of nine - year - old @entity22			1
police have long suspected @entity3 ( left ) of murdering @entity5 ( right ) who vanished in 1978 he had argued that his trial was prejudiced because details about three other child murders he had already been jailed for were revealed to the jury			1
police told the @entity31 they are now liaising with the @entity32 of the @entity33 to see if the appeal court ruling has ' any bearing on the @entity5 case '			2
they added : ' this liaison is still at a very early stage and will take some time to complete			0
' @entity3 was found guilty in 1994 of three child murders in the 1980s - those of 11 - year - old @entity42 , from the @entity43 , five - year - old @entity44 , from @entity45 , and @entity46 , 10 , from @entity47 , near @entity48			1
mystery : @entity5 's abandoned bicycle was found lying in a @entity8 lane in august 1978 his reign of terror finally ended in 1990 when he was caught red - handed with a six - year - girl hooded , bound , gagged and stuffed in a sleeping bag in the back of his van in the @entity43 village of @entity60			1
he had sexually assaulted her moments earlier			0
in 2012 he was prosecuted for a fourth murder , that of @entity22 , who was snatched as she cycled to a friend ’s house in @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , in 1981			2
the paedophile is serving a total of 12 life sentences for murder and kidnap			0
@entity10 ’s father , @entity75 , told the @entity31 radio 4 today programme that he hoped police had not overlooked any other suspect by spending time focusing on @entity3			1
@entity3 was found guilty of murdering @entity42 , 11 ( left ) and @entity46 , 10 ( right ) asked how he had coped in the decades since @entity10 went missing , mr @entity75 said it had been difficult as the incident was never far from his mind			1
' you look at everything that it could possibly be to do with her			0
you just cope very poorly sometimes			0
' mr @entity75 said he believed the police had coped very well with the case			0
the mystery remains @entity90 ’s longest running missing person inquiry but police have admitted that she was kidnapped and murdered			2
@entity10 was 13 when she vanished while delivering newspapers in her home village of @entity12 in @entity8 in august 1978			1
@entity3 last year lost an appeal against his latest conviction for the murder of nine - year - old @entity22 the police have asked the @entity33 ’s @entity99 to examine whether @entity3 can be brought to trial for @entity10 ’s murder			1
yesterday @entity10 ’s father @entity102 said : ' i want them to go ahead and put @entity3 before a court			1
' let a jury decide whether he did it			0
i want to know what he did with her			0
' speaking from his home in @entity112 , mr @entity75 , 72 , who is battling cancer , diabetic and is in a wheelchair : ' i am not 100 per cent @entity3 is responsible			2
i have a little bit of doubt			0
' i think about her every day			0
it is a nightmare that never goes away			0
despite what other people say , we will never get closure			0
' it is so difficult because we will never know the answers to our questions			0
we do n’t know if she was buried in some isolated spot or whether she was left wandering around somewhere			0
' i would love to be able to find out where he is an finally be able to lay her to rest after nearly 40 years of this living hell			0
' a senior police source said that if the attempt to use bad character evidence was unsuccessful , detectives may once again interview @entity3 in prison			2
but the officer said , it was ' a long shot ' as @entity3 has previously refused to co-operate when officers had been to @entity143 jail to see him			1
one former detective said previously : ' @entity3 played a game			2
he wanted a move to a @entity43 jail and would not talk until he got his way			0
' he also refused to meet @entity10 ’s father @entity102 who wrote to him and asked him for a face to face meeting			1
@entity3 refused to meet @entity10 's father who wrote to him and asked if they could meet police from different forces spent months trying to track @entity3 ’s movements in relation to various child murder cases			1
they were able to say the former delivery driver had been spotted by @entity160 - a short distance from @entity10 ’s home village of @entity12 - and used petrol receipts to see where he had been travelling - but it is was never enough evidence to pursue a murder charge			1
@entity167 , a retired @entity168 , said : ' cases like this are never closed			0
it would mean a great deal to the police and the community to see the mystery of @entity10 ’s disappearance finally solved			2
' @entity3 was arrested by @entity177 in 2005 in connection with @entity10 ’s disappearance but there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him			1
