by @entity1 reporter published : 11:05 est , 28 december 2012 updated : 14:40 est , 28 december 2012 scientists believe @entity3 could help to treat mental illness it has long been recognised for its wrinkle - busting properties			1
now , scientists believe @entity3 could also help to treat mental illness			1
new research shows that the cosmetic treatment can dramatically improve the symptoms of severe depression in more than a quarter of patients			1
dr @entity13 , medical director at the @entity14 , in @entity15 , has carried out research which suggests that physical expressions of emotion influence our feelings			0
for this reason , he believes that smoothing out frown lines using @entity3 can actually improve the mood of people with clinical depression			1
for example , he claims his latest research shows that forcing a frown can cause a depressed mood , while deliberately smiling can temporarily increase happiness			0
as @entity32 actress @entity31 once said : ' a smile is a curve that sets everything straight			1
' this is the second of dr @entity13 ’s studies which comes to this conclusion			0
he first proposed the theory that by preventing frowning , the toxin is interrupting signals to the brain that indicate the body is under stress or can not cope			1
for the newest study , dr @entity13 worked with 84 people with severe depression that lasted for an average of two years and which had not fully responded to treatment with antidepressants			1
the patients all received either @entity3 treatment to smooth out frown lines , or a placebo injection into the same facial region			1
they were then assessed three and six weeks later			0
by the end of the study , 27 per cent of those receiving @entity3 reported nearly complete remission of their depression compared to just 7 per cent of those who received the placebo			1
dr @entity13 said : ‘ this trial shows that inhibition of frowning can lead to remission in depression			1
’ the researchers suggests that physical expressions of emotion influence our feelings @entity3 is a well - known cosmetic treatment for age - related wrinkles around the eyes and forehead			1
however , the powerful toxin also has a wide range of medical applications , and is used to treat stroke victims ' muscle spasms , can ease migraine and even helps people with parkinson 's disease control their movements			1
it works by ' paralysing ' small groups of muscles to prevent them going into spasm or contracting regularly			2
this stops the surrounding skin from wrinkling			2
scientists have also recently discovered that @entity3 could help fight cancer by boosting the effects of chemotherapy , speeding up the destruction of tumour cells			2
in another experiment , @entity104 scientists have been trying to establish whether applying @entity3 gel to the nose could give hay fever sufferers relief from sneezing , itchy eyes and runny noses for up to three months			2
it is hoped that the botulinum toxin will affect the nerves in the nose and potentially block some of the chemicals released by the nerve endings which play a large role in causing hay fever symptoms			2
to try and treat the allergy , the @entity3 molecule has been re-engineered to be able to penetrate through the skin but also through the lining of the nose			0
' my life did a 360 - degree turnaround ' : a patient 's verdict of dr @entity13 's earlier experiment in his first study , in 2006 , dr @entity13 and his colleague dr @entity131 recruited ten women aged between 36 and 63 with a medical history of depression			2
the average period of depression was 3.5 years , although one patient had been ill for 17 years and had not responded well to conventional treatments			0
' patients who have had their frown lines treated with @entity3 are perceived by others to be happier ' seven out of the ten had been on anti-depressants but continued to be dogged by severe depression before taking part in the study			2
each volunteer - none of whom had had @entity3 before - underwent a thorough assessment by a clinical psychologist before the experiment began			0
they were then injected with the toxin and told to report back in two months , when another psychological assessment was carried out			0
using a questionnaire designed to measure the scale of depression , the researchers discovered nine were no longer clinically depressed and the one who still was reported a significant improvement in symptoms			0
' patients who have had their frown lines treated with @entity3 are perceived by others to be happier , ' says dr @entity13			0
one woman with an 11 - year history of depression said her life ' did a 360 - degree turnaround ' after the experiment			0
she got a new job and rekindled an old romance			0
some of the volunteers were seen again eight months later and their symptoms had returned as the toxin 's effects had worn off .			0

in a @entity32 trial , the treatment relieved symptoms in more than a quarter of patients - compared to just seven per cent of those given a placebo
scientists believe it works because it physically stops people frowning , something which can *trigger* *negative* emotions
