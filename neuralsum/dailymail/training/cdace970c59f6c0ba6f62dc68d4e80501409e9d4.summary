a six - legged , 1,900kg all - terrain walking robot has been created by a designer in @entity2			1
@entity3 , from @entity4 , believes that his six - legged ‘ mantis ’ is the biggest , all - terrain operational hexapod robot in the world			1
it is powered by a 2.2 litre turbo diesel engine and stands 2.8 metres high			1
it weighs 1,900kg and stands 2.8 metres high			1
it is powered by a 2.2 litre turbo diesel engine			1
it can be piloted from the cockpit or remotely using @entity21			2
it can tackle uneven surfaces using six - axis ' body attitude control '			0
can automatically level itself for pilot comfort			0
can move large objects with its feet			2
mr @entity3 , who is founder and chief designer of @entity31 – a company that supplies animatronic , robotic and cgi control systems and services to the film and television industry – can pilot the robot manually while sitting in the cockpit			1
alternatively , he can control it remotely using @entity21			0
the machine , which is surprisingly manoeuvrable , can also tackle uneven surfaces by adapting to terrain using six - axis ‘ body attitude control ’ , automatically level itself for the comfort of the pilot , and manipulate large objects with its ' feet '			2
footage posted on @entity46 shows it tucking its legs into its body for ease of storage on the back of a vehicle trailer			0
it also shows the ‘ @entity56 ’ moving a trailer around with one of its ‘ feet ’			0
mr @entity3 said : ‘ this is definitely the largest hexapod – six - legged walking machine - we have built so far			2
@entity3 , from @entity4 , believes that his six - legged ' @entity56 ' is the biggest , all - terrain operational hexapod robot in the world it is powered by a 2.2 litre turbo diesel engine and stands 2.8 metres high ‘ it started as an idea back in 2007			1
we secured private funding in 2009 to start the project and - after three years of design , build and testing - the robot made a first successful test drive in the summer of 2012 at @entity73			0
‘ it 's been called an instant design classic and an inspiring engineering project for the next generation			0
