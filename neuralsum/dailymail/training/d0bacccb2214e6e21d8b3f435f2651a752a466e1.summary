the pair were direct opponents for much of the match and @entity21 @entity5 is understood to have told referee @entity22 that @entity3 said to him : ' get your hands off me , you black c * * *			1
' @entity5 has accused @entity3 of racial abuse during @entity1 's 2 - 1 win over @entity6 the @entity29 are likely to investigate the incident once they receive a report from the referee on monday but @entity3 vehemently denied the claims when quizzed by manager @entity16 and assistant @entity34			1
and on sunday night a @entity1 spokesman told @entity36 : ' we have spoken to the player and he has stated that the accusation made is not true			1

but with @entity3 denying the claim , unless the alleged exchange was witnessed by another player or caught on camera it is likely to remain a case of one man 's word against another			1
