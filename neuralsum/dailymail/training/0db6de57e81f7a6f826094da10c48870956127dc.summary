by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:40 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 16:22 est , 28 march 2013 it 's been five decades since @entity3 said goodbye to said of its most beautiful and picturesque railway stations as the nation began to scale back its vast train network in a move that would see more than 2,000 stations closed			1
dr @entity11 's report on the state of the railways saw the network scaled back by around a third and stations in rural beauty spots up and down the country lost forever			1
this collection of images show the very last journeys made by locomotives on dozens of rural lines across the country before they were ripped up under the @entity24			2
many of the pictures from the 1960s depict hoards of rail enthusiasts clutching their cameras as they grab a final photo of a steam engine on their local branch line			0
and another series of images show a young @entity65 mp trying to quell a mob of protesters angry at the closure of the famous @entity46 between @entity69 and @entity70 which left vast swathes of the @entity72 without a rail connection			0
in september 1964 the rail crew held up a wreath for the last train to run on the @entity78 branch line rail enthusiasts gathered to see the last train to @entity82 pause at the @entity83 in september 1962 the last train to depart @entity84 on the @entity47 route to @entity48 was decorated with a wreath in september 1966 @entity86 at @entity52 which was forced to close because of the @entity11 report hundreds of photos have been compiled in a new book ' dr @entity91 50 years on ' to mark the landmark anniversary of the infamous decision to rip up 4,500 miles of track			1
the anniversary comes at a time when the many of the derelict lines , most of them in remote rural locations , are enjoying something of a revival			0
over the last 30 years enthusiasts and volunteers have worked to reopen some of the axed lines and have turned them into successful tourist attractions , such as the @entity110 in @entity111			0
many coastal routes such as the @entity113 ( pictured in may 1967 ) were axed by @entity11 in his cuts t to rail services one of the last trains on the @entity118 branch line was pictured at sunset in november 1963 one of the last trains on @entity121 to @entity123 line is watched by enthusiasts in march 1966 now numerous local authorities are looking into the prospect of doing the same to relieve congestion on the roads and restore public transport			2
at the time of the infamous report ' the @entity24 ' by dr @entity11 , the chairman of the @entity133 , motorways were being built across the country at a rapid rate and the car was seen as the future			1
but , due to today 's record costs of running a car , public transport has never been in more demand			0
@entity142 , the author of the ' @entity11 's @entity144 ' book said : ‘ the book is meant to be a memorial to all that was lost and i have tried to record all the lines that were closed			1
protestors blocked the line at @entity151 to fight against closures and @entity153 mp @entity65 tried to restore order dr @entity11 oversaw the closures of thousands of railways in the 1960s to the dismay of passengers and rail staff			1
the last train from @entity162 to @entity163 was decorated with a wreath in september 1965 the @entity165 from @entity166 ( pictured in september 1961 ) was one of the services to be cut under @entity11 's @entity24 ‘ but there is a serious point to it in that a lot of the closures under the @entity24 were n't really necessary and many of them are now needed more than ever			1
‘ the first motorway was built in 1959 and the car was the future and the railways were costing too much to run			0
‘ but the survey of the @entity3 railways that formed the report was pretty outrageous - it was flawed			1
‘ the survey took place in just one week in april 1961 and a third of the route that was surveyed carried only one per cent of passenger and freight traffic			2
‘ it did n't take into account seasonal traffic flows to the seaside for example			0
‘ most of the lines that were closed were in remote rural areas like in @entity197 and northern @entity198			2
dr @entity11 's report saw some 2,128 railway stations closed across @entity3 , with 650 lines of railway ripped up in @entity203 alone and many of the nation 's towns left without direct access to train services			1
one of the largest lines to close was the @entity46 from @entity69 to @entity70			0
the closure left the @entity203 borders the only area of @entity3 without a railway line and left the town of @entity215 , with a population of some 16,000 at the time , the furthest town away from a station			2
rail passengers from the @entity72 town would have to travel either 42 miles to @entity70 or 56 miles to @entity69 to catch a train			2
@entity11 @entity222 but @entity215 was not the only town in @entity3 with a population exceeding 10,000 left without a station			2
some of the biggest and most well known towns in @entity3 whose stations were closed after the @entity230 report include : for a full list of line closures following the @entity233 click here			2
in june 1963 dr @entity11 ( right ) chairman of the @entity236 examined the newly painted arch of @entity240 's @entity239 roof @entity11 , pictured travelling by rail and shaking a rail worker 's hand oversaw closures of more than 2,000 stations ‘ @entity248 lines such as @entity249 in @entity250 and @entity251 in @entity252 suffered the most and with no through trains from @entity255 , people just stopped going there			1
‘ the railways might have been expensive to run in the 1950s and ' 60s but it was still cheaper than it is today			0
‘ in real terms the cost to the taxpayer in 1961 was £ 1.6billion but today the privatised railways are subsidised to the tune of £ 3.5billion			0
‘ the decision to deatroy 4,500 route miles of railway , 2,500 stations and 67,700 jobs in 1963 was short - sighted			1
‘ many of these lines are needed today			0
rail passenger numbers are increasing today because the car is becoming so expensive to run and because of the level of congestion on our roads			0
’ locals in @entity110 have relaid 1,700 rails and 22,000 sleepers and the first passenger train for 37 years will depart from @entity280 to the south coast resort after the @entity24 the first @entity255 train for 37 years is pictured running past @entity283 to @entity110 , @entity111 @entity283 station in @entity111 has an exact replica signal box from @entity287 times to replace the modern day version dr @entity11 , chairman of the @entity236 holding the reshaping of @entity133 report @entity133 was losing £ 140m a year when dr @entity11 took over as chairman of the @entity292			1
his solution , announced on 27 march 1963 , was to ' make railways pay '			0
dr @entity11 wrote two reports proposing cuts to @entity299 services			1
the first was entitled the @entity24 and published in 1963			0
it was based on a survey carried out over one week in april 1961			1
a third of the route surveyed carried only one per cent of passenger and freight traffic			0
the second report in 1965 was called @entity24			0
the first report suggested that 2,363 stations and 5,000 miles of railway line should be closed - accounting for 55 per cent of stations and 30 per cent of route miles			1
the @entity312 government welcomed the report , but @entity3 people living in rural areas were against the plans			0
following the reports 2,128 stations and more than 67,000 @entity3 rail jobs were cut			1
more than 4,500 miles of track was lost			1
closures stopped in the early 1970s and nearly 30 stretches of railway have since been reopened , including the line between @entity255 and @entity325 in @entity111 .			0

report by dr @entity11 led to 2,128 railway stations being closed
more than 67,000 jobs were lost and 4,500 miles of railway ripped up
report was based on a flawed survey done in one week in 1961
