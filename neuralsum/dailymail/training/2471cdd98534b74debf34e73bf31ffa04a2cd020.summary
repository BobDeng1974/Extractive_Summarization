by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 11 july 2013 updated : 16:48 est , 11 july 2013 female athletes believe the development of breasts could seriously hinder their careers - and could even prevent them from reaching @entity6 standard			1
and some are going to drastic lengths to remove them - or even to stop them developing in the first place			0
according to @entity13 magazine , gymnasts push themselves to the ' brink of starvation ' to avoid developing breasts and a host of professional athletes have spent a lot of money to surgically reduce them			1
' for the modern athlete , the question is n't whether breasts get in the way -- it 's a question of how to compete around them ' , the magazine reports			1
while there 's no suggestion that @entity31 gymnast @entity30 has any qualms , many gymnasts are pushed to be as breastless for as long as possible to help their career @entity13 writer @entity35 cites female @entity38 competitor @entity37 's fight in february as a perfect example of a female athlete being hindered by her breasts			1
as soon @entity37 flipped her opponent to the floor , she notes that she quickly rushed to adjust her sports bra straps - a move that ended in disaster			2
' i got kicked straight in the chest right as i was trying to adjust my bra , ' @entity37 told @entity51			0
' you do n't see big titties in the @entity54 , and i think that 's for a reason , ' she added			1
@entity58 , author of the 1995 expose of gymnastics and figure skating , @entity57 , wrote that elite gymnasts would undereat and overtrain to delay menstruation			1
' you ca n't afford to have a woman 's body and compete at the highest level , ' she said			2
@entity67 , who at 14 was the youngest competitor on the 1996 gold medal @entity6 team added : ' the sport pushes us to be breastless little girls as long as possible			2
but though breasts were forbidden , privately we longed for them			2
' legends surrounding women 's breasts affecting their sporting prowess have circulated for years			1
one such legend suggests that female @entity80 cut off the right breast to hurl spears and shoot arrows more efficiently			2
in 1995 , a controversial @entity85 golf analyst called @entity86 told a newspaper that ' women are handicapped by having boobs			0
it 's not easy for them to keep their left arm straight			0
their boobs get in the way			0
' and @entity86 may have a point			0
judging by the latest research , women do seem to be held back - especially by larger breasts			2
a third of women taking part in the @entity103 with cup sizes ranging between @entity105 reported breast pain from exercise ; eight per cent even said the pain was ' distressing , horrible or excruciating '			2
a typical @entity110 breast weighs 0.43 of a pound and every additional cup size adds another 0.44 of a pound , according to research			0
it has also been found that the nipples of a woman who has c - or d - cup breasts can accelerate up to 45 mph in one second : faster than a @entity120			0
@entity37 ( left ) has spoken out to say : ' you do n't see big titties in the @entity54 , and i think that 's for a reason ' @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , has treated a number of elite athletes and sportswomen with this very problem			1
he says that large breasts are associated with a whole host of health issues including back and neck pain , skin rashes and bra straps digging in			1
it can also lead to poor posture and low self - esteem , which can affect an athlete 's performance			0
' over the years i have treated many elite athletes in a variety of sporting disciplines including hockey players , runners and female footballers '			1
' breasts can weigh a lot so they really can physically get in the way			0
' many athletes want to maintain their womanly figure but also reduce discomfort so it is a compromise and this must be discussed carefully with every patient , ' he adds			0
it has been found that a woman who has a c - or d - cup breast 's nipples can accelerate up to 45 mph in one second , which is faster than a @entity120 dr @entity167 , cosmetic doctor at @entity168 of @entity169 , the first doctor in the @entity171 ever to offer a non-surgical technique for breast reductions said : ' for professional athletes who maintain intense training regimes , these problems will of course be felt far more heavily			1
' training for long hours each day will only intensify the discomfort , meaning the size of their breasts wo n’t just get in the way of them exercising , but it can also affect their downtime away from sport , because it may take longer for them to rest and recover if they are still in pain in the back and breast areas			1
' over the years the inability to exercise or take part in sport has certainly become a more commonly cited reason for patients i see who are seriously considering undergoing a reduction			0
dr @entity167 says that medical advancements may also have contributed to the growing number of female athletes undergoing breast reductions			1
' now there are non surgical breast reduction methods that exist , which can allow women to undergo a reduction with very limited downtime			1
' for females who train regularly or are actively involved in sport , but are being prevented from doing so because of the size of their breast , a minimally invasive reduction technique could be a feasible solution , reducing the amount of time they would need to take away from sport to recover			2
protest : @entity221 beach volleyball player @entity220 launched a big - boob - pride campaign after @entity223 ( pictured ) announced she was having her breasts reduced from a @entity225 to a @entity226 because they were slowing her reaction time he does , however , warn of the dangers of breast reduction in young athletes , many who are under the age of 25			1
' it ’s important to note though that a breast reduction wo n’t be suitable for everyone			1
it is actually a procedure which is most suited to post-menopausal women , so a very young athlete , for example , might not be suitable for treatment , ' he adds			0
@entity221 beach volleyball player @entity220 launched a big - boob - pride campaign after @entity245 tennis player @entity223 , 18 , announced she was having her breasts reduced from a @entity225 to a @entity226 because they were slowing her reaction time			1
@entity220 argued : ' if she does this , it sends out the message that girls with big boobs ca n't play sports , and that is just wrong			1
' i am @entity254 , and i have never found them to be a problem			0
i could be double what i have and i would still be okay to perform			0
' ' i ca n't ever imagine my lacrosse coach telling me to starve myself in order to shrink my boobs in case they get in the way of my lacrosse stick ! what a ridiculous notion ' one international lacrosse player agreed with @entity220			2
she said : ' to hear that some women are trying to stop themselves from developing breasts altogether is horrendous ! ' we work so hard to ensure that our bodies are kept in peak physical condition and there are of course different considerations to take on board depending on the sport that you do			0
' gymnasts need to be smaller and more agile , but they also need to be strong and athletic in order to do all of the stuff that they need to - starving themselves in order to get rid of their boobs is not going to help their career in the long term			2
' i ca n't ever imagine my lacrosse coach telling me to starve myself in order to shrink my boobs in case they get in the way of my lacrosse stick ! what a ridiculous notion			0
' your boobs are your boobs			0
it 's the body that you 've been given and any athlete should know that you have to look after it and care for it in order to reach the top of your game			0
