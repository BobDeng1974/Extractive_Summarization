' he slammed the phone down with words to the effect " you 'll be getting money "			0
' while acknowledging @entity58 's courage in appearing at the commission , @entity1 rejected the claims that he accused him of tempting his father			1
' i disagree with his perception of the phone call with me and i strongly refute that i - at any time - accused him of tempting my father			0
