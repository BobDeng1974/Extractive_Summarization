by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 01:14 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 27 august 2013 the culling of badgers in the countryside to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis has begun , the @entity3 said this morning			1
militant hunt saboteurs have vowed to disrupt the cull by infiltrating animal rights groups planning peaceful protests			0
police have increased patrols in the countryside fearing violent clashes between farmers and hardcore opponents following the start of the cull			1
the environment secretary today insisted that the cull was necessary for the health of badgers as well as livestock , saying that he was concerned for the animals ' welfare as he used to have pet badgers - but added that it could take 25 years before the work of the cull is completed outrage : a protester expresses her opposition to the badger cull at a vigil in @entity33 , @entity34 plans : protesters crowd around a map as they embark on a walk around the proposed cull zone in a letter to farmers today , @entity3 president @entity40 revealed that culling had already begun in west @entity44 and west @entity34			1
he said that the move , which will see around 5,000 badgers killed over the next six weeks in two pilot schemes , was ' an important step not just for cattle farmers but for the whole farming industry '			2
he continued : ' we can not go on culling tens of thousands of cattle every year because of @entity53 while knowing the disease exists in wildlife uncontrolled			1
' badger control remains a controversial subject and we understand that some people will never agree with controlling badgers in this way			2
' i am confident however that through the combined efforts of farmers , the @entity3 and government over the last year to illustrate the impact @entity53 has on farms , and the scientific basis for badger control , more people than ever recognise the need to address the disease in badgers			1
' arrest : protester @entity73 is arrested while trying to gain access to a @entity76 compound in @entity44 more than 500 protesters are expected at the sites of the cull , with even some of those planning to demonstrate peacefully saying they are prepared to run from footpaths into the line of fire of the farmers culling the badgers to force them to put down their arms			1
but mr @entity40 insisted : ' i hope that when time shows that these culls have reduced @entity53 in cattle - just as has happened in @entity91 - that even more people will understand that while sad , these culls are absolutely necessary			1
' i hope that you will continue to show support for those farmers who are facing the nightmare of @entity53 on farm and especially for those who are in the culling areas			1
' the cull is an attempt to tackle bovine tb which is transmitted by badgers and has led to the death of 305,000 cattle in the @entity107 over the past decade			2
' i 've actually had pet badgers as a child , and i want to see healthy badgers , ' environment secretary @entity108 told @entity112			1
' if we had a workable vaccine , we would use it			0
a badger vaccine would have no effect on the high proportion of sick badgers in @entity53 hotspots who would continue to spread the disease			1
' we are working on new badger and cattle vaccines but they are years away from being ready and we can not afford to wait while @entity53 gets worse			1
' protest : a vigil was held in @entity33 , @entity34 last night to demonstrate against the badger cull vigil : @entity128 claimed that more than 200 people attended the event hours before the start of the cull he added : ' the intention is to roll out this policy in other areas next year subject to these two culls proving effective , efficient and humane			1
my target is that the @entity107 should be @entity53 free in 25 years			1
' we know that , despite the strict controls we already have in place , we wo n't get on top of this terrible disease until we start dealing with the infection in badgers as well as in cattle			2
that 's the clear lesson from @entity149 , @entity150 , the @entity151 and the @entity152			0
' that is why these pilot culls are so important			0
we have to use every tool in the box because @entity53 is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly			1
' @entity158 claimed the coalition had cut spending and research on vaccines for badgers and cattle , and said the @entity166 's official assessment of the pilot culls had revealed it would cost £ 4million to police the two schemes			1
shadow environment secretary @entity169 said : ' the government 's divisive badger cull will cost more than it saves and will spread bovine tb in the short term as badgers are disturbed by shooting			1
' we need a science - led policy to manage cattle movements better and a vaccine to tackle @entity53 in cattle			2
ministers should listen to the scientists and drop this cull which is bad for farmers , bad for taxpayers and bad for wildlife			0
' march : animal rights activists paraded in the area where the cull was due to take place in a last - minute protest anger : passionate protesters have vowed to block the cull from going ahead this week police have said militant campaigners have infiltrated local campsites and have been spotted patrolling farmers ’ fields wearing balaclavas at night			2
one group , @entity198 , said it would trespass on to sites with large horns to scare the badgers away and remove bait left by farmers			2
last night @entity128 held a vigil event in @entity33 against the cull			0
a statement on its @entity208 page after the event said : ' over 200 people tonight at the procession , thank you all so much for coming ... we fight on , knowing that we are right helps			0
' it comes as a protester , named as @entity73 , was arrested yesterday for allegedly trying to break in to a @entity76 site in @entity217 , @entity44			1
@entity218 , of @entity198 , said ‘ extensive research ’ had been carried out to find out where the badgers ’ setts are and where peanut bait had been laid by farmers			2
he added : ‘ the intention is to just turn up in large numbers , making lots of noise , getting in the way and having a massive presence			0
we will try to locate the shooters , which will involve trespass if necessary			0
protest : the sign yesterday outside an anti-cull camp near @entity238 in @entity34 controlling disease : 5,000 badgers could be killed in two trials culls ‘ spoiling bait is one of the most effective ways you can sabotage the cull , because if the bait ’s not there the badgers wo n’t be drawn away			1
’ dozens of people have also set up a camp , dubbed @entity253 , on the outskirts of the sleepy harbour town of @entity238 , @entity34			2
mostly members of campaign group @entity256 , they intend to carry out nocturnal patrols looking to document evidence of wounded badgers			0
protest : animal rights groups say badgers should be vaccinated instead of culled @entity264 , 39 , a gardener from @entity265 , @entity266 , said : ‘ if it came down to it and i was in the killing zone , then yes , i would run in front to try and stop the shooting			0
that would be my natural reaction			0
‘ it ’s your natural instinct to protect an animal as if it was a pet or your own child			0
' ' our intention is to carry out peaceful protest while on patrol at night and stick to the footpaths , but i could n’t say that i ’d stick to that if i saw culling			0
our main task is about raising awareness			0
’ miss @entity264 added that protest groups had been buoyed by recent anti-fracking protests in @entity289 , @entity290 , when hundreds of activists were able to stop exploratory drilling temporarily			0
the past 15 years has seen a boom in bovine tb which is spread to cattle when badgers urinate on grass which is eaten by cows			1
the trial scheme is due to continue every year for the next four years , and is predicted to cut bovine tb by 16 per cent			0
two companies have been given the licence to carry out the culling in the counties , but both @entity76 and @entity305 , the public body responsible for the operation , have kept their identities a secret in case activists target them directly			0
last week the @entity311 was granted an injunction in the @entity313 barring anti-cull activists from approaching farmers ’ homes , business premises and cull sites			0
animal rights groups , which include support from guitarist @entity321 and actress dame @entity322 , say the authorities should vaccinate badgers instead .			0
