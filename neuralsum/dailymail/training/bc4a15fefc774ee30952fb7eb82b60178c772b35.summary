a primary school which banned pupils from using @entity3 slang to halt a ‘ decline in standards ’ has revealed the controversial policy seems to have improved children 's reading and writing			1
parents were furious when school chiefs ordered children to stop speaking the dialect , saying it should be preserved to protect the local identity			2
staff at @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , drew up a list of ten outlawed phrases such as ' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that , ' and ' it wor me '			1
parents including @entity26 with her son @entity27 , nine , were angry with the ban on @entity3 dialect , but grades in reading and writing have improved it has emerged that the ban has been a success in the classroom , with pupils achieving higher grades in reading and writing			1
the number of children gaining @entity43 reading had improved by seven per cent with 79 per cent of pupils gaining level four			1
children achieving the higher level five grade in reading has also gone up nine per cent to 41 per cent			1
headteacher @entity49 said : ' our intention was not to remove any local culture or identity but to give our children the spoken language skills to compete against the best			2
headteacher @entity49 defended his school 's dialect ' ban ' , saying it will help pupils achieve success the letter sent out to parents last year gave a list of outlawed phrases , such as ' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that , ' and ' it wor me ' ' it would be great to see a more positive view on what we are trying to achieve here			1
' last year mr @entity49 enraged parents when he told them about the @entity3 ban			1
here are the phrases pupils at @entity17 , in @entity18 , have been banned from using : 1			1
' they was ' instead of ' they were			0
' i cor do that ' instead of ' i ca n't do that			1
' ya ' instead of ' you			0
' gon na ' instead of ' going to			0
' @entity82 ' instead of ' was			0
' i day ' instead of ' i did n't			2
' i ai n't ' instead of ' i have n't			0
' @entity84 ' instead of ' something			0
' it wor me ' instead of ' it was n't me			1
' @entity89 ? ' instead of ' pardon ? ' in a letter to parents , he said : ' recently we asked each class teacher to write a list of the top ten most damaging phrases used by children in the classroom			1
' we are introducing a ' zero tolerance ' in the classroom to get children out of the habit of using the phrases on the list			1
' we want the children in our school to have the best start possible : understanding when it is and is not acceptable to use slang and colloquial language			0
' we value the local dialect but are encouraging children to learn the skill of turning it on and off in different situations			0
' the @entity3 includes @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , and southern parts of @entity119			1
other words and phrases on the prohibited list include ' ay ' , meaning ' pardon ' , and ' i day ' , meaning ' i did n't '			1
@entity26 , 30 , whose nine - year - old son @entity27 goes to the school , said staff should be teaching pupils about the @entity3 and its dialect			1
' some of my friends have gone on to be doctors and lawyers and i 'm an engineer – [ the accent ] does n't affect you as a person , ' she said			0
' i think it is patronising and insulting to say that people with a @entity3 accent are disadvantaged			1
all the parents are outraged			0
' but @entity140 , 31 , who moved to the @entity141 eight years ago and whose seven - year - old son is a pupil , supported the ban , saying : ‘ @entity144 is my second language			0
so for me … it is good if my child speaks @entity144 in the house and not slang picked up at school			0
’ the primary school , which has 592 children aged four to 11 and was judged ‘ good ’ at its last @entity154 inspection			1
the number of children gaining @entity43 at @entity157 , @entity18 , @entity19 , has improved by seven per cent with 79 per cent of pupils gaining level four the distinctive @entity3 dialect of the ' @entity161 ' is spoken in towns like @entity119 , @entity116 , @entity163 and @entity115 , and can be very confusing to outsiders			1
scholars find it fascinating because it has preserved grammar from @entity169 and even @entity144			0
' @entity170 ' , ' thy ' and ' thou ' are still in use , as is the case in parts of @entity175 and @entity176			0
' @entity177 ' , meaning ' how beist thou ? ' is a common greeting , with the typical answer being ' @entity181 too bah ' , meaning ' i bay n't be too bad '			0
' i have n't seen her ' becomes ' i ay sid ' er '			0
@entity3 dialect often substitutes the word ' ar ' for ' yes '			2
several word pronunciations are also different : ' you ' is pronounced ' yow ' ( pronounced yo with a silent w ) , whereas ' go ' , which is often pronounced ' goo ' or ' gooin '' for ' going ' , is more in line with pronunciations in the @entity195			0
the heritage of the @entity19 is brought to life at the @entity198 and locals are keen to retain their distinctive dialect it is also quite common for broad @entity3 speakers to say ' agooin ' instead of ' going '			1
inhabitants are proud to be known as @entity3 ' folk ' and resist hints at any relationship to people living in @entity209 , calling @entity209 ' @entity210 - a - jum ' ( @entity209 's colloquial name is ' @entity212 ' , a corruption of its older name of ' @entity215 ' and hence @entity216 ) or ' @entity217 ' ( missing the g and h out and saying it the way it 's spelt )			2
residents of @entity209 ( ' brummies ' ) meanwhile often refer to their @entity3 neighbours as ' @entity161 ' , a reference to the use of ' @entity226 ' ( or yow 'm ) instead of ' you are ' , and not because they say ' i yam ' instead of ' i am '			2
@entity115 residents often refer to the people of @entity209 as ' @entity221 '			0
also , the town of @entity117 can be pronounced either ' @entity233 ' or ' @entity234 ' , with a strong @entity117 accent considered to be typical ' yam - yam '			0
the strong @entity3 dialect is less commonly heard today than in the past			2
however , a stronger variation of the dialect ( than the one frequently used ) appears to be heard quite often in conversations between older @entity3 folk			2
the word endings with ' en ' are still noticeable in conversation as in ' gooen ' ( going ) , ' callen ' ( calling ) and the vowel ' a ' is pronounced as ' o ' as in ' sond ' ( sand ) , ' hond ' ( hand ) and ' mon ' ( man )			0
other pronunciations are ' winder ' for window , ' fer ' for ' far ' , and ' loff ' for ' laugh ' exactly as @entity254 's @entity144 was spoken			0
local dialect was ( and probably still is to a lesser degree ) quite distinctive between the different towns and villages of the @entity3			2
although most outsiders to the @entity3 ca n't tell this difference , @entity3 folk can quiet fiercely defend the difference between the accent			1
here is a glossary of @entity3 vocabulary : @entity268 , heave @entity269 @entity270 - a pert young woman @entity272 , stone blithyed - a fool @entity275 large moth @entity277 - to hinder @entity279 - a small hill @entity281 - a brewery @entity282 - a gossipy old woman @entity284 - can not @entity286 's intestines ( a @entity3 delicacy ) @entity288 - joking @entity289 @entity291 - a flea @entity292 @entity293 strain @entity295 - an outside toilet @entity298 lie , fib @entity301 items , paraphernalia @entity303			2
