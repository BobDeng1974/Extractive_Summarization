we are constantly told how much sugar there is in fizzy drinks and cakes			1
but what about the hidden sugar in so - called healthy foods ? a leading professor has spoken out about the dangers of ' hidden sugar ' in food			1
he also cautions against opting for low fat foods that are often full of sugar instead to give them flavour			1
@entity16 , professor of @entity17 at the @entity18 at @entity19 and the @entity20 , says the food industry is adding more and more sugar to food , which consumers are largely unaware of , as it is mostly hidden			1
hidden enemy : a leading professor has warned that many of us have no idea how much sugar is hidden in certain foods			1
he has compared well - known sugary foods such as @entity33 , frosties and popcorn with other that many of us consider to be quite healthy writing for @entity37 , he said : ' added sugar in our diet is a very recent phenomenon and only occurred when sugar , obtained from sugar cane , beet and corn , became very cheap to produce			1
' it ’s a completely unnecessary part of our calorie intake : it has no nutritional value , gives no feeling of fullness and is acknowledged to be a major factor in causing obesity and diabetes both in the @entity54 and worldwide			2
' professor @entity16 has compiled a table of some of the most common culprits			1
he says : ' while it may not be surprising that a can of @entity33 has a staggering nine teaspoons of sugar ( 35g ) , similar amounts can be found in the most unlikely of foods			1
' these include flavoured water , yogurts , canned soup , ready meals and even bread			1
the full list of items professor @entity16 analaysed ( source : the conversation ) @entity74 where you least expect it : 300g ( about 3/4 can ) of @entity77 contains four teaspoons of sugar , while 150g of @entity79 0 % @entity81 yogurt contains five half a jar of this @entity84 and @entity85 pasta sauce has nearly as much sugar as a bowl of @entity88 as professor @entity16 expains : ' you might opt for 0 per cent fat in your yoghurt , but what if it also comes with five teaspoons of sugar ? a bowl of @entity88 with semi-skimmed milk only has four			1
' at the other end of his scale , a @entity101 caramel @entity99 with whipped cream - made with skimmed milk - contains 11 teaspoons of sugar			1
a can of regular @entity33 has nine , a @entity106 bar eight			2
when it comes to food , a @entity109 's @entity110 with @entity111 contains six teaspoons - two more than a 25g bag of @entity114 toffee popcorn			1
' it ’s clear this sugar plays a part in soaring levels of obesity and diabetes			2
to this end , leading health experts from across the globe have united to tackle – and to unmask hidden sugar so consumers can make informed decisions about what they eat and drink			1
' @entity128 ' @entity110 with @entity111 contains six teaspoons - more than a small bag of toffee popcorm he adds that sugar in our diets should now be gradually reduced , just as salt has been over the past few years			1
' @entity136 content in food products in the supermarkets have now been reduced by 20 - 40 per cent and as a result , salt intake has fallen in the @entity54 by 15 per cent ( between 2001 - 2011 ) , the lowest known figure of any developed country			1
' this this will have reduced stroke and heart attack deaths by a minimum of 9,000 per year , with a saving in health care costs of at least £ 1.5bn a year , according to the @entity149 ( @entity149 )			2
crammed : a regular can of @entity33 contains nine teaspoons of sugar , while one @entity106 bar contains eight professor @entity16 says that a similar move could be taken with sugar			1
' like salt , most of the sugar we consume is hidden in processed food and soft drinks			1
' there are also specific taste receptors for sugar , which if sugar intake is gradually reduced , become more sensitive			2
so over time we do n’t notice that sugar levels have gone down			2
' if we can persuade the @entity169 that this programme is very likely to help considerably with the obesity epidemic - and in particular to reduce childhood obesity - while also reducing the incidence of dental disease , and ( very likely ) the number of people developing type 2 diabetes , it should have a good chance of success			1
