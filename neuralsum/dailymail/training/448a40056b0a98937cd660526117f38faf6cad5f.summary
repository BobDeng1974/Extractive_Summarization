the average household could save up to £ 400 a year if everything bought was eaten rather than sent to the tip. in a stark indictment of the @entity15 ’s throwaway culture , mps reveal in a report today that the nation as a whole dumps food worth £ 12.5billion a year			1
but a booming global population will put food supplies under severe pressure in the near future , experts claim , and there is an urgent need to tackle waste if @entity15 is to be kept fed. the report , compiled by the @entity29 , estimates that of the 15million tons of food wasted nationally , nine million tons is completely edible			1
@entity31 , @entity32 chairman of the committee , said : ‘ nine million tons of food goes into bins each year , yet a considerable proportion is fit for consumption			1
‘ this level of waste is unacceptable economically , socially and environmentally			0
’ with the global population set to hit nine billion by the end of the century , ensuring everyone has affordable , healthy food is a ‘ growing challenge ’ , mps on the committee warned			1
they said more people must be encouraged to buy @entity15 food , in order to reduce imports from abroad which can often be unreliable			1
but food is wasted at every stage of the food chain , the @entity40 ’ report said			0
misshapen fruit and veg is left rotting in farmers ’ fields , meat quickly passes its sell - by date on supermarket shelves , and ton after ton of uneaten food is taken out of household fridges and put in the bin			2
the report said : ‘ half the @entity15 ’s food waste ( around seven million tons ) occurs in the home , with the average household throwing away the equivalent of six meals every week at a cost of £ 250 – £ 400 a year			1
’ farmers and other food manufacturers waste four million tons – 27 per cent of the nation ’s waste			1
and retailers and food distributors throw away 0.4million tons – just under 3 per cent			2
@entity81 , a food writer and expert on the @entity15 food chain , said a major part of our wasteful habit is caused by the weekly shop			2
she told the @entity88 : ‘ for decades , supermarkets have been encouraging us to get all of our food for a whole week in the one store			0
it means we stock up , but it means we throw more away			0
the report said : ‘ half the @entity15 ’s food waste ( around seven million tons ) occurs in the home , with the average household throwing away the equivalent of six meals every week at a cost of £ 250 – £ 400 a year ' ‘ people who shop more frequently and regularly are less likely to buy food that they do n’t need			1
’ mps said despite the amount being thrown away , others are going hungry			0
the report said : ‘ food donations were used to meet the food needs of an increasing number of people			0
‘ the @entity107 estimated that some 913,000 people had received foodbank support in 2013 – 14			0
@entity110 estimates that one in six parents have gone without food themselves in order to feed their family			0
’ a government spokesman said : ‘ it is wrong that anyone should go hungry at the same time as food is going to waste			2
‘ we support industry ’s action on this , and want to help them build on progress to date			0
this follows on from publication last year of guiding principles and research to encourage the redistribution of surplus food fit for human consumption			0
’ food minister @entity132 told the committee that the government has tried to reduce waste by changing advice on best - before dates .			2
