a relaxed saturday morning atmosphere reigned at @entity1 today as ten of the world 's most powerful people huddled in a log cabin in the @entity6			1
gone were the ties and furrowed brows of a busy week , cast aside for open - necked shirts and cosy woollens as the likes of @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity15 's @entity14 sat back amid the idyllic @entity17 setting			1
looking at the pictures from today 's meeting , it is almost hard to believe these were the leaders of the @entity23 nations grappling with the problems of soaring oil prices and the eurozone on the brink of collapse			1
dress down : the eurozone may be in crisis but @entity12 looked remarkably laid back at the @entity30 , pictured alongside a grinning @entity15 pm @entity14 and @entity33 chancellor @entity32 the prime minister and his @entity36 counterpart kicked off their weekend in typically sporting fashion , taking to president @entity13 's gym for a bout of treadmill diplomacy			1
the president was said to have called for mr @entity12 at around 7.15am at his cabin - called @entity43 - at the picturesque retreat			1
after a session pounding the treadmills , the two men emerged still deep in conversation			2
they were seen walking back to the cabins around 7.50am			2
officials attending the summit were coy about which man had been the more athletic performer - instead emphasising the intellectual content of their encounter			2
it seems mr @entity12 is not one to let the pressures of running the country get in the way of a little downtime			2
a new book describes his leisurely weekend lifestyle , which apparently finds him indulging in the odd frame of snooker , a few glasses of wine with sunday lunch or even a spot of karaoke			0
in the biography , entitled @entity12 : practically a conservative , a friend says of the pm : ' if there was an olympic gold medal for ‘ chillaxing ’ , he would win it			0
' idyllic setting : talks begin between the leaders of ( clockwise from lower left ) @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , the @entity36 , the @entity83 , @entity15 , @entity33 , the @entity84 and the @entity85 relaxed : ( from left ) @entity80 prime minister @entity86 , @entity36 president @entity13 , @entity12 and @entity15 prime minister @entity14 listen cheerfully to @entity33 chancellor @entity32 during the @entity30 at @entity1 , @entity17 true to this casual outlook , mr @entity12 met with his fellow world leaders in a grey jumper with a checked collar underneath , while on either side of him , mr @entity13 and the @entity15 prime minister mr @entity14 sported blue , open - necked shirts			1
the first working session of the @entity30 came after officials had worked through the night to find an agreed form of wording on the eurozone issue for the final summit communique			1
following his preparatory talks with mr @entity13 , the prime minister signalled that the @entity23 leaders were ready to tackle soaring oil prices			1
mr @entity12 said action was needed to protect world economies			0
' we are addressing here the two biggest threats to all our economies and that is , of course , the eurozone crisis but also the very high oil prices that translate into high prices at the pumps , ' he said			1
' we are making progress on both			0
' picturesque : @entity32 and her aides arrive at @entity1 , set high in the @entity6 , for a bilateral meeting with mr @entity14 back to nature : chancellor @entity32 ( second from right ) and mr @entity14 ( right ) hold talks over coffee in @entity1 's idyllic woodland setting mr @entity12 said the summit - which brings together the leaders of @entity83 , the @entity36 , @entity33 , @entity82 , @entity80 , @entity79 , @entity81 and @entity15 - was an opportunity for the non-eurozone nations to press the currency bloc to resolve its problems			1
' particularly on the eurozone , what is required is a sense of urgency and then clear actions for strong banks , strong deficit reduction plans , strong governance and strong contingency plans for whatever might happen , ' he said			0
' on all those things i think there 's a good sense of talks taking place and a good sense that action needs to follow			2
' the @entity23 ca n't instruct the eurozone what to do but why meetings like this matter is that eurozone countries can hear from countries outside the eurozone whose economies are affected			0
enjoying the view : president @entity13 shows his fellow leaders round the @entity1 retreat on a sunny @entity30 saturday keep up , @entity12 : mr @entity13 and @entity32 ( in purple ) lead the pack as the @entity23 representatives stroll through @entity1 new addition : recently elected @entity82 president @entity163 ( left ) shares a joke with the @entity36 president as @entity32 and @entity12 line up on the lawn ' it 's very important these messages get across but i would say there is a growing sense of urgency that action needs to be taken , contingency plans need to be put in place and the strengthening of banks , governance , firewalls , all of those things , need to take place very fast			1
' mr @entity12 refused to be drawn into criticising @entity33 chancellor @entity32 for blocking a rescue package for the eurozone			0
however , he indicated that he would like to see the @entity186 do more to stimulate demand			0
' i think the @entity33 chancellor is absolutely right that every country needs to have in place strong plans for dealing with their deficits , ' he said			0
' growth and austerity are n't alternatives			0
you need a deficit reduction plan in order to get growth in order to have the low interest rates that we have in @entity83 and are vital for the future of our economy			0
' but clearly , just as @entity83 benefits from a strong government with a strong deficit reduction plan and strong banks but also an independent monetary policy giving us low interest rates , helping to push demand in the economy , so the eurozone , i believe , needs that approach as well			0
' first ladies ' meet : as the @entity23 gathered in @entity1 , @entity218 hosted some of the leaders ' spouses for a tour of the @entity223 in @entity224 @entity225 : mrs @entity218 shows off some of the artwork kept at the president 's residence			1
the tour marked a first appearance for @entity231 ( right ) , partner of the new @entity82 president @entity163			2
