cutting edge : a model is seen using the product , which will be available for purchase in april 2005 ' the ones that were small enough did n't include soap or water , which leads to razor burn			0
and the ones that did include it were definitely not purse - friendly			0
' ms @entity4 spent ' countless nights ' gluing and taping prototypes together and making pages of sketches before she came up with the @entity7 's clever design			1
she adds that its all - natural organic soap can be rubbed in like moisturizer after the shave , so there 's no messy residue to rinse off			2
in addition to the @entity7 's original black and white models , ms @entity4 plans to manufacture a colorful array of razors in bright patterns and shows 15 different versions on her website			1
