new dna analysis claims the @entity3 is n't an ancient polar bear , but instead is a @entity6 bear it 's a mystery that has fascinated scientists and the public for decades : just what is the ape - like creature - known as the @entity3 - said to be stalking the @entity6 mountains ? last year , a geneticist claimed to have solved the mystery when he said the @entity16 was a distant relative of the polar bear , thought to have died out more than 40,000 years ago			1
but new dna analysis has thrown doubts on this theory			0
researchers have shown that the two hair samples analysed actually originate from a modern polar bear , and a type of rare bear native to the high mountain ranges			1
the analysis suggests that the @entity3 is not a previously unseen primate , nor is it a polar or brown bear hybrid as previously thought , but instead a sub-species of the @entity6 bear			1
the original analysis was carried out by @entity31 , professor of human genetics at the @entity33			0
he set out to collect and test @entity16 hair samples to find out which species they came from			1
in particular , he analysed hairs from two unknown animals , one found in the @entity6 region of @entity40 and the other from @entity42 , 800 miles ( 1,287 km ) to the east			2
after subjecting the hairs to the most advanced dna tests available , he compared the results to other animals ' genomes stored on the @entity50 database			2
from this , professor @entity31 found he had a 100 per cent match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone found in @entity56 , @entity57			1
this jawbone dates back between 40,000 and 120,000 years - a time when the polar bear and closely related brown bear were separating as different species			1
professor @entity31 believed the most likely explanation was that the animals from which the hairs were taken were hybrids - crosses between polar bears and brown bears			1
the species are closely related and are known to interbreed where their territories overlap			0
but , this theory has been questioned due to an error in analysing the data			0
researchers @entity74 , from the @entity75 , and @entity76 from the @entity33 looked at the same hair samples that led professor @entity31			0
' we should like to propose an alternative origin for the hair samples , ' the scientists said in their paper			0
last year , a geneticist analysed hair samples that are said to have been taken from the mysterious @entity3 creature			2
he said he had a 100 % match with a sample from an ancient polar bear jawbone and said the @entity16 was an ancient relative of polar bear ( stock image pictured ) crossed with a brown bear but , doubts have been thrown on this theory			1
researchers @entity74 and @entity76 looked at the same hair samples analysed by @entity96			0
they propose that the samples belong to a @entity6 bear - a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the @entity103 ' the @entity6 bear is a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the @entity103 , in remote , mountainous areas of @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity42 and @entity109			1
' its populations are small and isolated , and it is extremely rare in many parts of its range			0
' professor @entity31 acknowledged the error , issuing a statement : ' importantly , for the thrust of the paper as a whole , the conclusion that these @entity3 samples were certainly not from a hitherto unknown primate is unaffected			1
' last year , in what was the first serious scientific study of the abominable snowman for 50 years , professor @entity31 from the @entity33 analysed 30 samples of hair			0
the hairs had supposedly been shed by yetis , or their bigfoot cousins , and were part of museum and private collections from around the world			2
twenty eight of the hairs were genetic matches to known animals from bears to racoons , horses and cows			0
but two did n't fit the mould			0
their dna matched that recovered from a 40,000 - year - old polar bear fossil			1
one hair was reddish brown and found in a @entity3 nest in a bamboo forest in @entity42 , ten years ago			1
the second was golden brown and taken from a @entity3 in @entity40 on the @entity108 - @entity109 border 40 years ago			1
but new research suggests professor @entity31 's findings were in fact down to an error in analysing the data			0
researchers @entity74 , from the @entity75 , and @entity76 from the @entity33 looked at the same hair samples that led professor @entity31 to make his bold claim			0
they propose that the previously unexplained samples come from the @entity6 bear - a sub-species of the brown bear that lives in the higher reaches of the @entity103 , in remote , mountainous areas of @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity42 and @entity109			1
yetis , also known as the @entity16 , have been recorded for centuries in the @entity103 , with local people and mountaineers claiming to have seen hairy , ape - like creatures			2
a photograph of a @entity3 footprint , taken by @entity180 climber @entity179 at the base of @entity182 , sparked global mania after it was taken in 1951			2
legendary mountaineer @entity185 , who became the first man to climb @entity182 without oxygen , has studied yetis since he had a terrifying encounter with a mysterious creature in @entity108 in 1986			0
@entity16 , also known as the @entity16 , have been recorded for centuries in the @entity103 ( pictured ) , with local people and mountaineers claiming to have seen hairy , ape - like creatures			2
a photograph of a @entity3 footprint , taken at the base of @entity182 , sparked global mania after it was taken in 1951 he uncovered an image in a 300 - year - old @entity199 manuscript of a @entity200 - another local name for the yeti , with text alongside it which was translated to read : ' @entity16 is a variety of bear living in inhospitable mountainous areas			1
' professor @entity31 added : ' @entity209 and other enthusiasts seem to think that they 've been rejected by science			0
' science does n't accept or reject anything , all it does is examine the evidence and that is what i 'm doing			0

@entity219 test shows @entity16 is n't a sub-species of polar bear thought to be extinct
studies suggested @entity16 may be hybrid of polar bear and brown bear
but new research shows hairs were likely from sub-species of brown bear
*experts* added that the @entity3 is unlikely to be a previously unknown primate
