@entity0 threw aside any reservations like a club - crested gilet as @entity4 scored the goal that clinched their progress to the @entity8 quarter - finals			1
having allowed himself a smile when @entity12 ’s wonderful strike flew in , he punched the air with all the glee of a lifelong @entity4 fan after @entity17 ’s tame effort somehow outfoxed @entity18 one minute from time			1
@entity0 watched this tie from the stands as first team coach @entity21 took control in the dugout			2
but after a goalless opening period , @entity4 ’s 11th consecutive first half without scoring , the new manager was in the dressing room at the interval to address certain issues			1
from the outside , his words seemed to have had an immediate impact			0
@entity17 celebrates after he clinched the win for @entity4 with his 89th - minute strike at @entity36 @entity0 was delighted with @entity17 's goal , and can be seen here clenching his fists in celebration @entity0 was a reserved figure for much of the game but he could not hide his enjoyment at @entity4 's second goal , punching the air @entity12 opened the scoring in the second half with a powerful strike from long range at @entity36 @entity17 knocks in @entity4 's second goal , although it had a hint of good fortune with @entity18 at fault @entity4 ( 4 - 3 - 3 ) : given 7 ; @entity53 7 , @entity54 7 , @entity55 7 , @entity56 6.5 ; @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6 , @entity59 6.5 ; @entity12 7.5 ( @entity17 77 mins ) , @entity60 6 , @entity61 6 ( @entity62 82 ) subs not used : @entity65 , @entity64 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68			1
goal : @entity12 68 , @entity17 89			1
@entity71 ( 5 - 4 - 1 ) : @entity18 5 ; @entity72 5.5 , @entity73 5 ( @entity74 65 ’ 5 ) , @entity75 6 , @entity76 6 , @entity77 5 ; @entity78 5.5 , @entity79 6 , @entity80 5.5 , @entity81 6 ; @entity82 6.5			1
subs not used : @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89			0
booked : @entity77 , @entity72			0
man of the match : @entity12 attendance : 28,098			2
@entity4 beat @entity71 by raising their attacking fluency in the second half and despite @entity82 ’s consolation in stoppage time , a loud roar greeted the final whistle			1
@entity102 knows these supporters , long - starved of much to shout about , would embrace a trip to @entity105 , now just one win away			0
@entity108 survival is the prime concern , of course , but there were signs of encouragement here , too			0
@entity114 was sacked and @entity0 installed because @entity4 desperately required a change to shake this underperforming squad into life and out of the relegation zone			1
the bounce hoped for by @entity0 ’s arrival has got off to a springy start			1
‘ @entity0 came in the dressing room before the game briefly , introduced himself and wished the boys the best , ’ said @entity21			2
‘ he came in at half time and made a couple of points to everyone about things he had spotted			2
there was a lot of individual detail there , it was not one big sweeping statement			0
‘ i put across my points about the game , what i thought and what i saw , and he had an input after that			0
he brought some good info to the group , good football knowledge that comes with experience and a lifetime in the game			0
’ @entity0 , who watched this match sitting between chief executive @entity150 and head of recruitment @entity152 , will convey those ideas at his first press conference as @entity4 boss on monday before turning his attention to the visit of @entity159 on saturday			1
for his opposite number , this was another bad sunday			0
seven days ago @entity91 was sacked then reinstated as @entity71 manager			2
here , the club ’s fans requested he ‘ sort it out ’ and also decried the performance as a ‘ load of rubbish ’ during the closing stages			0
@entity91 explained the decision to stick with five at the back against @entity173 football ’s worst attack because @entity4 play narrow and the system might come in useful as @entity71 fight to stay in the top flight			1
trialled first in the defeat at @entity179 , it seemed unnecessary against a @entity4 side that had scored 15 goals in all competitions this season prior to kick - off			1
but three minutes after @entity91 replaced @entity73 with @entity74 to go to 4 - 4 - 2 , @entity4 took the lead			2
there were plenty of empty seats on show at @entity36 with the teams recent troubles seeming to keep fans away @entity71 's @entity77 puts in a challenge on @entity12 as the @entity4 man attempts to attack down the right wing @entity82 , fresh from scoring his first @entity71 goal against @entity179 in midweek , runs at @entity61 @entity78 rides the tackle of @entity4 captain @entity54 as both sides battled it out for an @entity8 quarter - final place @entity200 leaps across his goal to brilliantly tip away a shot from @entity71 's @entity79 at @entity36 in the 68th minute @entity54 , recalled for his first match since injuring his knee at @entity205 on @entity206 , found @entity12 on the left flank			1
the @entity209 winger cut inside @entity210 and unleashed a shot that flew into the far corner			0
@entity60 was also recalled by @entity21 but he wasted his one big chance by blazing over the bar in the 72nd minute when put clean through			0
@entity4 ’s second goal did come with a minute left on the clock			2
@entity60 lofted a ball to @entity17 , who wriggled around @entity72 and just about hit a shot on target			2
but @entity18 should have done much better than blocking with one hand before fumbling the ball in with the other			0
@entity82 runs with the ball ahead of @entity56 during the fifth round tie at @entity36 on sunday @entity4 striker @entity60 wins a tussle for the ball with @entity71 centre back @entity76 @entity0 was in attendance to watch his new charges for the first time from the stands and gave the thumbs up to supporters @entity12 strikes what proved to be the winner with his right boot as a @entity71 's @entity210 dives in to attempt a block @entity72 and @entity12 can only watch as the ball flies towards the top corner of @entity18 's net neither @entity18 not @entity75 could do anything to stop the excellent strike in its path as it headed for the net bacuna wheels away to celebrate his brilliantly - struck goal that sent @entity4 into the last eight of the @entity8 @entity12 is mobbed by his team - mates as @entity4 grabbed their second home goal in their last two games at @entity36 @entity71 had shaded the first - half chances but only beat the excellent @entity200 in stoppage time — @entity82 scoring past the @entity254 keeper with a firm header			1
it was all too late for @entity71 fans who had voiced their concern			0
‘ people are entitled to their opinion , ’ said @entity91 , whose side go to @entity260 on sunday			0
‘ what we have to do is find a way of being consistent during a game and then game - to - game			0
we need mental resilience , absolutely			0
’ just the kind of thing @entity4 have recruited @entity0 to provide			1
@entity17 shoots past @entity210 to double @entity4 's lead in the second half at @entity36 @entity18 's error saw him almost knock the ball into his own net after initially stopping @entity17 's strike @entity17 celebrates his strike with fellow substitute @entity278 - and it proved to be the winner with @entity82 's consolation @entity17 delighted the @entity4 fans , albeit in a depleted crowd , with his impact and first goal since he moved on loan from @entity286 @entity18 can not bear to look after his fumble saw @entity17 's shot end up in the back of the @entity71 net @entity0 must not have been impressed with what he saw as he went downstairs to deliver the team talk at half - time @entity71 supporters , showing off their fancy dress efforts , display a cardboard and foil replica of the @entity8 in the stands at @entity36			1

@entity12 strikes from outside the box to give watching @entity0 a perfect start
@entity17 added a second with his first goal for @entity4 after @entity18 's mistake
@entity82 scored his second goal in two games with an excellent header - but it proved a consolation
@entity200 got a chance to play for @entity4 - his *combined* age with @entity71 keeper @entity18 was 80
@entity4 also had two goals ruled out either side of half - time for *offside* , although both calls were correct
the @entity323 side join @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 and @entity327 in the @entity8 last eight
