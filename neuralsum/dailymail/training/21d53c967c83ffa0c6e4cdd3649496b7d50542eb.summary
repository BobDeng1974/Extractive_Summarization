@entity2 now concentrates on the ‘ darkest places ’ of the internet inhabited by ‘ the plotters , the proliferators and the paedophiles ’ , its outgoing head stressed yesterday			1
its staff are committed to the protection of the public from those who exploited the so - called ‘ dark web ’ , sir @entity8 said			1
sir @entity8 , who retires this month after six years in charge , also insisted @entity17 ’s electronic eavesdropping agency did not engage in ‘ anything remotely resembling mass surveillance ’			1
while he acknowledged that tracking down perpetrators online meant accessing the internet ‘ at scale ’ , he said his organisation was committed to delivering security while protecting privacy to the ‘ greatest extent possible ’			0
surveillance : the @entity2 listening post in @entity29 , where its staff monitor the ' darkest places ' of the internet his comments come after a turbulent year for the intelligence agency , overshadowed by the disclosures of the former @entity36 intelligence operative @entity35			1
@entity2 has also come under criticism after it was revealed earlier this year they are allowed to spy on @entity17 citizens ’ use of @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 without an individual warrant because the firms are based overseas			2
speaking at the @entity46 in @entity47 , sir @entity8 issued an impassioned defence of its work , while paying tribute to his staff , some of whom he said had made ‘ the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty ’ - although he gave no further details			1
referring to his staff , he added : ‘ the people who work at @entity2 would sooner walk out the door than be involved in anything remotely resembling ‘ mass surveillance ’			1
‘ my staff are the embodiment of @entity17 values , not a threat to them			0
’ @entity2 and its @entity36 counterpart , the @entity66 , came under fire from civil liberties campaigners on both sides of the @entity70 after mr @entity35 leaked thousands of documents revealing the scale of their surveillance activities			2
after mr @entity35 revealed @entity2 was gathering millions of pieces of data on @entity17 citizens , sir @entity8 was forced to defend his organisation to @entity77 in an unprecedented public hearing			1
in response to whistleblower @entity35 's ( pictured ) claims that @entity2 is spying on @entity17 citizens , sir @entity8 said his staff would rather ' walk out the door ' than engage in mass surveillance in the hearing before the government ’s @entity86 , alongside the heads of @entity83 and @entity84 , he claimed terrorists had started changing their tactics because of mr @entity35 ’s revelations			1
yesterday sir @entity8 sought to underline the scale of the challenge facing the agencies - describing the ‘ enormous exodus ’ to the internet as ‘ the biggest migration in human history ’			1
he said that only a small percentage of all the emails , texts and images sent globally were within reach of @entity2 ’s sensors - of which only a small percentage were actually intercepted			2
but he acknowledged the volumes were still large			0
he said : ‘ we access the internet at scale so as to dissect it with surgical precision			0
practically , it is now impossible to operate successfully in any other way			0
‘ you ca n’t pick and choose the components of a global interception system that you like - catching terrorists and paedophiles - and those you do n’t - incidental collection of data at scale : it ’s one integrated system			2
’ with the ‘ vast majority ’ of such criminal threats to the @entity17 coming from groups or individuals based abroad , sir @entity8 said strong intelligence and cyber capabilities were needed to identify and - where they were beyond the reach of international law enforcement - directly disrupt them			1
he said : “ we all now know that the beautiful dream of the internet as a totally ungoverned space was just that – a beautiful dream			0
like all utopian visions , it was flawed because it failed to account for the persistence of the worst aspects of human nature			0
sir @entity8 said his organisation was committed to delivering security while ensuring privacy to the ' greatest extent possible ' ' alongside the blessings – the comprehensive information , the communities of interest , the commercial opportunities and efficiencies – there are the plotters , the proliferators and the paedophiles			1
from what we know of ungoverned spaces in the real world , do we really believe that the world would be a better place if the @entity132 becomes an ungoverned space where anybody can act freely with impunity ? ” he added : ‘ those who would do us harm do n’t want to be found			0
they use certain routers or applications to hide in the darkest places of the internet			1
‘ we have to enter that labyrinth to find them			0
we work to crack their defences			0
we have to understand what adversaries seek to do to us and dedicate ourselves to preventing them from realising their plans			0
’ he stressed that the ‘ core ’ of @entity2 ’s mission was ‘ the protection of liberty , not the erosion of it ’ and that it actively sought to minimise intrusion into people ’s everyday lives			2
he added : ‘ by definition , the acquisition , aggregation , usage , sharing and retention of information involve varying degrees of interference with , or intrusion into , the privacy rights of individuals			0
‘ so those activities can only be undertaken if judged to be necessary in the interests of our statutory purposes - national security , economic well - being or the prevention and detection of serious crime - and proportionate in what we seek to achieve			0
’ @entity2 was formed in 1919 and employed @entity211 code - breaker @entity209 in the @entity212 .			2
