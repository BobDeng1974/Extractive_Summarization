the magnificently - coloured frogs were trying to clamber up a tree deep in the heart of the @entity12 rainforest when one got a little stuck			1
but instead of leaving his stricken mate behind , the more agile specimen stuck out his hind leg to help her onto the perch			1
after dangling precariously for a few seconds , she worked her way up his body onto the twig to carry on their journey high into the trees			0
ribbetting : the moment was captured in the @entity27 in @entity12 , as two distinctive red - eyed tree frogs clambered up a tree teamwork : the red - eyed tree frog has three eyelids and sticky pads on its toes and is native to @entity36 rainforests in @entity37 the shot was captured in the @entity27 in @entity12			1
@entity40 , 37 , has taken pictures of wildlife from @entity43 but was thrilled when he managed to snap this shot			2
he said : ' i was hoping to capture a moment i witnessed in nature once , and this was the result after a lot of waiting			0
it seemed to me as if one frog was begging the other for help , while trying to stay alive			0
' ' they are incredibly agile creatures and it was great to photograph them in their natural habitat - almost camouflaged within the trees			0
' the red - eyed tree frog has three eyelids and sticky pads on its toes that usually make climbing trees second nature .			2

the shot was captured in the @entity27 in @entity12
