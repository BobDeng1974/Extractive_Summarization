they would prefer to move him abroad although @entity8 would guarantee quicker payment			2
@entity10 will move for a new centre - half if captain @entity12 leaves for @entity13			0
talented : @entity4 impressed for the champions @entity0 last season on his way : could @entity4 have played his last game for @entity0 ? and @entity4 is on the @entity19 ’ radar as they make plans for the exit of @entity12			1
the @entity23 international was watched extensively by @entity8 scouts during his time at @entity27 , but @entity0 moved quickly to snap up @entity4 in 2012 as he developed a reputation as one of the best emerging defenders in @entity31			1
despite missing out to @entity0 , the @entity33 club remain keen on @entity4 and are set to revive their interest should @entity12 leave			1
@entity4 ’s future at the @entity36 is unclear this summer due to the pending arrival of @entity5			2
experience : @entity12 is still a top player on his day frustrating : @entity12 has endured his fair share of injury woes over the last few years @entity41 could join @entity13 whether @entity12 completes a move to @entity43 remains to be seen , with the @entity19 far from convinced about selling their skipper			2
the @entity46 international has less than 12 months on his existing deal meaning he can leave on a free transfer next summer			0
but @entity10 knows letting @entity12 go , particularly after the departure of fourth - choice centre - back @entity52 , would leave him alarmingly short of options in the position			0
it is understood @entity10 would give serious consideration to a player - swap deal with @entity13			0
@entity10 has shown firm interest in @entity13 central defenders @entity61 and @entity62 in the past , and may look to include either in a deal for @entity12 .			0
