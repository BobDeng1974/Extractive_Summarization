@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 crept into 58 - year - old @entity2 ’s bedroom and ambushed him as he slept , before making off with £ 2,000			1
£ 250,000 in cash in the attic of the property , as well as £ 100,000 secreted in another house owned by @entity2 , went unnoticed by the killers			0
the court heard @entity14 , 24 , and @entity15 , 39 , spent the money they had stolen on a trip to @entity26 , where they posed for photographs in front of the @entity30 , en route to their native @entity5			1
37 - year - old @entity16 , flew directly back to his homeland , but not before spending some of the money he had stolen on an @entity35 and designer clothes			1
the @entity37 was told that the trio had planned their raid in meticulous detail , scoping out nearby streets in a bid to avoid detection on @entity45			1
and @entity14 was so confident he had cheated justice he agreed to fly back from @entity5 for questioning by police without an extradition warrant			1
but the killers had failed to notice a camera on a @entity52 hotel , which captured their movements on the night of the murder			2
the reclusive multi-millionaire was ambushed as he slept at his home in @entity52 , pictured dna from mr @entity2 was also found inside a @entity57 had bought from a friend a few days earlier			1
the three had all denied murder but were convicted following a three - week trial at the @entity37			1
@entity16 attempted to deny his involvement by claiming he had only been employed by the pair to watch their victim ’s car			2
the @entity66 , judge @entity67 , sentenced them all to life imprisonment with a minimum of 30 years before parole			2
he said : ‘ i see no reason to distinguish between any of you			0
@entity74 of you lent yourself and involved yourself in a deliberate planned attack on a man in his own home for gain			0
‘ it was predicated on violence to beat out of him where the money was hidden in that house			1
in furtherance of that plan he was literally beaten to death in his bedroom in circumstances of extreme violence			0
‘ he did n’t stand a chance			0
’ mr @entity2 , known to friends as @entity94 , owned a large portfolio of properties in west @entity97 , many of which were let to visitors from @entity101 and @entity102			0
he dealt mainly in cash , stashing vast sums around the houses he owned , and preferred to use @entity5 builders for renovation work			0
his killers had carried out renovations for him in the weeks before his death and detectives believe he had unwittingly revealed the location of some of the money to at least one of them			0
on the night of his death they lay in wait until he turned off the lights and went to bed before forcing open a sash window and attacking him in his bedroom			0
he was discovered by a young assistant at his property in @entity52 , last october 21			0
the trio were each sentenced to life in prison at the @entity37 today after being convicted of the murder each of the killers , who had all been having financial problems , got away with around £ 2,000 - but a further £ 250,000 stashed in his attic went ‘ plainly undetected ’ , the court heard			1
mr @entity2 , described by friends as ‘ reclusive ’ and ‘ scruffy ’ , had been obsessive about the possibility of being burgled since his stepfather was attacked years earlier			2
he often kept a bayonet - type blade close to his bed as he slept but did not have it with him on the night he was killed			2
mr @entity139 said : ‘ he was plainly taken was surprise , the range and extent of his injuries being far beyond anything required merely to subdue him , which suggests a beating to get him to reveal where his money was before he was finally finished off			0

@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 crept into the home of reclusive millionaire @entity150 , 58 , as he slept
the @entity37 heard that the men *intended* to ' beat out of him ' where the money was hidden
trio - who had all denied murder - were each found guilty and sentenced to a total of *90* years in prison for the *brutal* killing
