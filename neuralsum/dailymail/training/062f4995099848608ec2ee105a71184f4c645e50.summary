it is also a treatment for other ailments , from migraine headaches to hyperthyroidism and glaucoma			0
however the drug has been linked to other deaths - most notably , the @entity46 actress @entity44			1
@entity19 was found on the bedside table of the @entity49 star after she died suddenly in her @entity51 home in december 2009 , after suffering from flu - like symptoms and shortness of breath			1

the side effects of @entity19 can include the heart excessively slowing down and the patient feeling weak and tired			1
people react differently and what is a good dose for one person , might not be right for another			0
there ’s nothing to be frightened about if you are taking these but you do need to make sure the dose is suitable for the individual			0
’ at the couple ’s home , mrs @entity9 ’s widower last night declined to discuss the circumstances of his wife ’s death			1

’ coulthard himself was told the news about his sister just moments before he was due to appear on the @entity150 show , @entity151			0
he was given the option of dropping out of the show by producers , but instead decided to appear on the 90 - minute programme hosted by tv - chef @entity155			2
he later said : ‘ it just seemed like the right thing to do and what @entity9 would have wanted			1
my parents were in @entity138 and i discussed their travel plans with my father			0
we agreed to meet back in @entity71 the next day			0
‘ i ’ve since thought a lot about the decision			2
i do wonder if my sporting career helped me to detach myself from the reality and just get the job done			0
but the show also helped me to fill those hours			0
i knew no amount of reflection could bring her back			0
it felt like there was little i could do to help in @entity71			0
’ the pair , who also have an elder sibling , @entity135 , were known to be extremely close and , until 2005 , ‘ @entity174 ’ – as she was nicknamed by her family - ran her brother ’s fan club , as well as the official @entity3 motoring museum in @entity136			2
in a moving tribute at her funeral , mr @entity3 , 42 , said : ‘ i will remember her on her wedding day , she looked beautiful , in love with @entity62			0

‘ i was a bit miffed so when he won in @entity220 and announced it was dedicated to me it was the best birthday present ever			0
’ she added : ‘ we watched the race on a @entity232 channel and they have breaks which seem to last half an hour so we kept having to phone home to @entity136			0
when @entity3 finished the final lap we were ecstatic			0
’ after his win , the driver said : ‘ it was my sister ’s birthday and she asked me for a win , so i dedicate this race to her			0
