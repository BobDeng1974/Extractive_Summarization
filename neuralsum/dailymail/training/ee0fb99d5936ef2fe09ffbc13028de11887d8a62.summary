@entity0 has been slammed for its lack of action on climate change by a new report that ranks it the worst performer out of all the industrialised countries			1
the 2015 @entity7 ( @entity7 ) , which rates countries based on their performance in five categories including climate change policy , ranked @entity0 as 60th – the second last place – just above @entity13			1
@entity14 from the @entity15 , who provided the report 's authors with comment on @entity0 's climate policy , told @entity21 the results show that ' the world is going forward and we are going backward '			1
@entity0 was ranked 60th in the world , the second last place , by the 2015 climate change performance index ' our low ranking is mix of a few things , firstly it 's because our per - person emissions are very high compared to other countries , ' mr @entity14 said			1
' what also caused the drop is that in the last 12 months our government has repealed the carbon price which did actually work			0
it reduced around 17 million from our electricity sector			0
' they 've also moved to weaken the renewable energy target			1
at the moment the target is 41,000 gigawatt - hours by 2020 and they want to reduce it to 26,000 , so essentially they want to cut it by 40 odd per cent			0
despite making up 0.33 per cent of the population , @entity0 emits 1.14 per cent of the world 's carbon emissions			1
the poor result has been attributed to the government 's worsening climate policy , including a proposal to weaken the renewable energy target			1

@entity65 of @entity66 this is a significant imbalance when compared to @entity58 which was ranked first amongst the countries scrutinised by the report and was recorded as having 0.08 per cent of the world 's population and emitting 0.11 per cent of the globe 's co2			2
even the @entity74 and @entity75 , which are the world 's biggest producers of @entity72 and produce 14.69 per cent and 23.43 of the world 's emissions respectively , managed to score five ranks higher than @entity0			2
mr @entity14 said that if @entity0 wanted to improve its ranking , it would need to implement a much higher emission reduction target			0
' @entity84 is a five per cent reduction commitment by 2020			0
in the @entity74 they 've announced a 28 per cent reduction by 2025			0
for us to match that we 'd have to commit to 30 per cent , ' he said			0
@entity0 's ranking has worsened over time : ' as @entity94 withdrew a lot of good policies in place and the @entity0 delegation play a very negative role at the climate negotiations , the policy grades where much worse than in previous years , ' @entity89 , the report 's author said @entity0 's score card : despite making up 0.33 per cent of the population , the report stated that @entity0 emits 1.14 per cent of the world 's carbon emissions the reports authors , @entity89 from political and social analyst group @entity107 , also pinned the worsening results on failed government policy			1
@entity14 from the @entity15 said the results show that ' the world is going forward and we are going backward ' ' as @entity0 has ( compared to the most other countries ) a very high emissions level , a bad emissions trend , nearly no new renewables [ sic ] and also no good developments in the field of energy efficiency , @entity0 's better rating in the past came from the policy part , ' ms @entity89 told @entity21			1
' your former government was relatively pro active regarding climate change policies like emission trading schemes or carbon taxes			2
' as @entity94 withdrew a lot of good policies in place and the @entity0 delegation play a very negative role at the climate negotiations , the policy grades where much worse than in previous years			2
' the report , which was created by @entity107 and @entity135 and released in @entity136 where the @entity138 climate talks are taking place , was issued as news emerged that foreign affairs minister @entity140 was originally blocked from attending the talks by the @entity143 office			0
however ms @entity140 bypassed the decision through a @entity146 meeting and is now expected to arrive in @entity136 's capital on tuesday to meet with almost 200 other leaders to discuss a global climate change agreement .			0

the poor result has been attributed to worsening climate policy , including a proposal to weaken the renewable energy target
report author @entity89 said the nation has ' a very high emissions level , a bad emissions trend , nearly no new renewables and also no good developments in the field of energy efficiency '
