they are touted as the next bit thing in technology - smartwatches that can keep you up to date right from your wrist			0
however , experts have warned they could also be the next big target for hackers			2
a video reveals just how easy it is to read messages sent to a smartwatch running @entity15 's @entity14 software			1
for this proof - of - concept , a @entity19 4 @entity14 device equipped with @entity20 and @entity21 were used			1
using special software the team was able to ' brute force ' a six digit passcode used to link the phone to the watch - and then read messages sent to it			1
' @entity33 , bands and devices all have a lack of security			0
' we trust these devices with everything from messages and @entity42 updates to biometric information , ' said @entity44 of @entity45 , which uncovered the issue			2
' everything from @entity50 messages to @entity42 or @entity51 chats are constantly being forwarded to your smartwatch			1
' he found that @entity15 's @entity56 software relies on a six digit pin code to link to watches			1
' this six digit pin code can be easily bruteforced , ' he said			1
' it was not all that that difficult to do			0
' ' because the @entity56 obfuscation relies on a pin code of only six digits during the initial pairing , an attacker would n’t take long to brute - force number and start reading your conversations in plain - text , ' he wrote			1
' of course , this means an attacker would have to be fairly near the victim and log all intercepted @entity75 data packets , but the large - scale adoption of such an exploit could be fueled by the increasing number of smartwatches or smartbands			0
' weaponizing it could only be a matter of time			0
' for the proof - of - concept , a nexus 4 android device equipped with @entity20 and @entity21 were used			1
' the implications of these recent findings are only moderately surprising – we know from past experience that adoption of new technologies does not always go hand - in - hand with better security practices			0
' @entity56 watch was unveiled by @entity15 at its developer conference in @entity95 earlier this year			2
the firm showed off the latest watches running @entity14 wear , a version of @entity14 designed for wearable computers			0
' it 's finally possible to make a powerful computer small enough to wear on your body , ' said @entity15 's @entity105			0
it showed off the @entity108 watch , which shows the users the most relevant alert at the time - for instance , a flight they are about to get or an upcoming meeting			1
@entity15 also revealed apps for its watches , including a food ordering app from @entity118 that allows users to order favourite food directly from their wrist , and a recipe app called allthecooks that walks users through recipes on the watch face			2
using special software the team was able to ' brute force ' a six digit passcode used to link the phone to the watch - and then read messages sent to it			1
@entity108 said the @entity134 would initially be made available to 12 countries including the @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140 , adding that it would announce its price and shipping date shortly			0
' as one of the first @entity56 devices to market , we see this as the beginning of a long - term commitment to making wearables running @entity14 wear a household name , ' said dr. @entity152 , president and ceo of @entity108			0
' we ’re confident that once consumers see how useful and compelling @entity56 can be , it will be integrated into their daily lives , just as smartphone have done			0
