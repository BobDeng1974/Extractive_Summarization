she 's also taken in foster dogs @entity44 , a pit bull mix with one eye , chihuahua @entity47 and @entity49 , a beagle - terrier cross who suffers from a neurological condition which makes it difficult for her to walk			1
the @entity56 worker said : ' i have always loved animals			0
when i was 19 , i was working as a dog trainer and visited a local shelter for the first time			0
' i was shocked to learn that the majority of the animals there would not make it out alive and i was determined to do something about it			0
i 've been working in rescue ever since			0
( from left to right ) @entity44 , a pit bull mix with one eye , beagle - terrier cross @entity49 and @entity19 all take a bath at ms @entity6 's house ms @entity6 acts as a foster parent to numerous other dogs as she look to find them new , loving places to live the rescue worker says that ' people are n't sure what will be involved in caring for a special needs pet ' and shy away from adopting them the dog - lover maintains that she is able to see past the canines ' disabilities			1
' every animal has something unique that makes you fall a little in love with them , ' ms @entity6 said			1
' it 's incredibly humbling to have an animal show you love and trust - especially when they have experienced the worst humanity has to offer			0
ms @entity6 says many of the animals were unwanted because potential owners are unsure about the work required			2
ms @entity6 set up a @entity29 page for @entity19 that helped fund the dog 's treatment ' i think the main reason disabled animals are sometimes not adopted is simply because people are afraid of the unknown			1
people are n't sure what will be involved in caring for a special needs pet			0
' she regularly takes her dogs to veterinarian appointments and shares photos of their progress after previous lives of neglect			2
' we do occasionally come across someone who feels our efforts are being wasted on these special - needs animals , and that we should focus our efforts on animals who are ' normal ' and healthy			0
' at an adoption event a man once referred to @entity36 as a ' freak of nature ' - and i decided then and there that he needed to stay with me forever , that was 12 years ago			0
' i feel strongly that every animal deserves a chance - and they can do so well if they are given a chance			0
' ms @entity6 is an advocate for the rehabilitation of dogs with special needs and set up a @entity29 page , which now has more than 37,000 likes , after adopting @entity19 when she was just a few days old			1
the pit bull pup - now one - was born with a cleft lip and palate and three veterinarians recommended euthanising the animal , who had pneuomonia when she was abandoned and was not expected to survive her first night in shelter			1
however , thanks to ms @entity6 's devoted care she has come leaps and bounds			2
she said : ' when i started @entity149 's @entity29 page , i had absolutely no idea that it would be as popular as it is now			0
' ' i have loved sharing her - and the other rescued animals - with people around the world and have been so very appreciate of the support we 've received in return			0
' @entity19 was born with cleft palate and was only able to feed from a tube for the first four months of her life after four months only able to be tube - fed , the puppy was taken to a @entity162 surgeon and can now eat regular food			1
' @entity19 's followers have helped us raise necessary funds for surgery and medical procedures , and helped to find homes for some of the special needs animals in our care , ' ms @entity6 said			1
she sees a slow change in attitudes towards puppies with disabilities			2
' we are often contacted by the parents of children with cleft palates and other physical differences , who say their children have identified with @entity19 and enjoy seeing how well she is doing , ' @entity19 and the other special - needs dogs featured on her page are famous and loved because of their differences , and i think there 's a really important message in that			1
' the rescue worker has set up giving pages to help contribute to medical needs for several dogs			2
after an operation from a @entity162 surgeon , @entity19 was able to eat food normally and is now healthy			2
