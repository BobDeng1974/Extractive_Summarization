property tycoon @entity13 , 58 , who was known as @entity1 , was found in the attic bedroom of a house he was renovating in @entity15 , @entity16 , in october last year			1

@entity21 , 39 , and @entity22 , 24 , both of @entity23 , west @entity16 , and @entity24 , 37 , of @entity25 , north @entity16 , who had carried out renovation work for the tycoon just weeks earlier , deny murder			2
the court was told the three builders lay in wait until mr @entity1 turned off the lights and went to bed , before forcing open a sash window and attacking him			1
his body was discovered by a young assistant at one of his properties in @entity40 on october 21 last year			2
following the killing , @entity22 and @entity21 took a coach from @entity44 in central @entity16 back to their homeland - stopping off on the way for a three - day break in @entity49 where they posed in front of the @entity52 , the court heard			0
@entity24 flew directly back to @entity9 , but is said to have blown hundreds on designer clothes and an @entity54 during a spending spree just hours after the killing			1
one of the defendants later told police they took £ 2,000 but officers later found they missed £ 225,000 hidden in and around the bedroom , and a further £ 100,000 at another property in @entity62			1
home : mr @entity1 's body was discovered by a young assistant at this property in @entity40 , @entity15 on october 21 last year mr @entity1 owned a large portfolio of properties in @entity16 and abroad , many of which were let to visitors from @entity72 and @entity73			1
he dealt mainly in cash , stashing vast sums around the houses he owned and preferred to use @entity9 builders for renovation work			1
@entity79 , prosecuting , said : ' mr @entity1 , though reclusive and scruffy in appearance , was no ordinary occupant of this west @entity16 house			1
' he was in fact a very wealthy property developer who owned various addresses in the west @entity16 area			0
' mr @entity1 owned numerous properties , both here and abroad , and was a multimillionaire			0
' he had plainly retired to bed			0
he was obviously taken by surprise - the range and extent of his injuries being far beyond anything required merely to subdue him , which suggests a beating to get him to reveal where his money was before he was finally finished off			0
' in court : @entity21 , 39 , @entity22 , 24 , and @entity24 , 37 , all deny murdering property tycoon mr @entity1 at the @entity5 mr @entity98 added : ‘ it will be apparent the victim had not given up his life cheaply as vast sums of money - about £ 225,000 - were discovered by police secreted in and around his bedroom and plainly undetected by his killers			2

he often kept a bayonet - type blade close to his bed as he slept , said mr @entity98 , adding : ‘ sadly that was not available to him in the early hours of october 21			0
‘ there is little or no evidence of him being able to fight back			0
he had plainly retired to bed and when his body was found he was only wearing a t - shirt			2
‘ he was plainly taken was surprise , the range and extent of his injuries being far beyond anything required merely to subdue him , which suggests a beating to get him to reveal where his money was before he was finally finished off			0
