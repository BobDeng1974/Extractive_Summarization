a spreadsheet that a man emailed his wife detailing her reasons for turning him down for sex has been shared by thousands of people online			1
for a whole month , the 26 - year - old sexually - frustrated husband jotted down every response from his other half when he asked her for intimacy			0
he then collated the information and put it into an @entity13 document before cruelly emailing her as she arrived at an airport ahead of a ten - day business trip			1
shocked at the email , the anonymous woman , also aged 26 , tried to get in touch with her husband but he failed to return her calls			1
in the end , she decided to share her husband 's harsh behaviour with users of @entity20 by uploading the spreadsheet			1
she explained the couple had been together for five years in total but been married for last two			0
although they had no kids , they bought a house together five months ago			0
' our lives have been crazy busy , ' she wrote			0
' we spent all spring renovating our new house			0
at my job i was given nearly double my usual workload after some of my colleagues were laid off			0
i gained some weight in the winter and have been busting my a * * at the gym to get rid of it			0
' a frustrated husband 's list of reasons his wife refused him sex has been spread around the internet ( picture posed by actors ) she then wrote : ' yesterday morning , while in a taxi on the way to the airport , husband sends a message to my work email which is connected to my phone			1
' he 's never done this , we always communicate in person or by text			1
i open it up , and it 's a sarcastic diatribe basically saying he wo n't miss me for the 10 days i 'm gone			2
' attached is a spreadsheet of all the times he has tried to initiate sex since june 1 , with a column for my " excuses " , using verbatim quotes of why i did n't feel like having sex at that very moment			1
' the spreadsheet , which has since been deleted , was quickly spread around the internet with web users taking both sides in the debate			1
most people slammed the husband 's ' immaturity ' and said he should have made his point in a different way			2
one @entity20 user wrote : ' there are so many ways this could have been communicated better , but instead he came up with some bizarre hit and run with a spreadsheet method which i 'd say is actually going to be really hard to come back to a normal relationship from			2
' another said : ' your husband is expressing legitimate concerns in an extremely immature and passive aggressive way			0
' clearly , the communication style in your relationship is s * * t. fix it or do n't , it 's your marriage			2
' one added : ' maybe her husband has got sick and tired of being totally and utterly ignored for months on end , has had enough and wants resolution to the issue			0
this time , after all attempts , he has got her attention			2
