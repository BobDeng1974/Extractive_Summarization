by @entity0 published : 19:54 est , 4 august 2013 updated : 01:39 est , 5 august 2013 @entity1 has called for an investigation into election ‘ irregularities ’ in @entity5 as ageing tyrant @entity6 was accused of stealing a seventh term in office			1
the foreign secretary voiced ‘ grave concerns ’ amid widespread reports of massive vote rigging and intimidation of @entity6 ’s rivals			1
the @entity16 said yesterday that the 89 - year - old autocrat won the election with 61 per cent of the vote , with challenger @entity21 ’s @entity20 party on 34 per cent			1
victory ? @entity6 voters carry a coffin representing the political demise of @entity21 yesterday but leaked intelligence documents revealed yesterday that @entity6 used £ 500million of ‘ diamond money ’ to rig the elections			1
the documents , dated june 3 , detail how @entity30 and @entity5 diamond companies pumped cash into a secret fund controlled by @entity6 ’s party @entity33			1
the money was then used to pay an @entity36 firm to rig the electoral roll and ‘ secure 50 per cent of the adult vote ’ for @entity6			1
the slush fund was used to gift @entity6 the support of one million ‘ ghosts ’ ( voters who are dead ) and 116,000 voters aged over 100			1
@entity6 took 61 per cent of the vote , but a cloud of corruption hangs over the result in @entity33 strongholds , the number of registered voters far exceeded the adult population			1
the documents reveal that the electoral roll contained 900,000 duplicate names with identical addresses and dates of birth but different @entity60 numbers , allowing @entity33 supporters to vote multiple times in different constituencies			1
according to the @entity66 , @entity64 , president of the @entity65 , allegedly gave £ 56million to the war chest and the government of @entity69 gave £ 61million			2
the paper quoted a political adviser with links to the government , who said : ‘ @entity33 created millions of ghost voters they used to swing the elections in their favour			2
’ election observers from the @entity79 and the @entity80 were kept out , while those from autocratic regimes such as @entity30 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 were invited to attend			2
but the election was judged to be fair by the @entity88			2
and yesterday @entity90 president @entity89 offered ‘ profound congratulations ’ to @entity6 , urging ‘ all political parties in @entity5 to accept the outcome ... as election observers reported it to be an expression of the will of the people ’			1
mr @entity21 said he would challenge the results in court			2
‘ the fraudulent and stolen election has plunged @entity5 into a constitutional , political and economic crisis , ’ he added			2
‘ instead of celebration , there is national mourning			2
’ mr @entity1 said : ‘ i commend the people of @entity5 on holding peaceful elections			2
however , we have grave concerns over the conduct of the election			0
’ @entity6 's rival : @entity21 addresses a media conference in @entity113			1
he called the elections a ' sham ' he added : ‘ the preliminary statements of the @entity88 and @entity116 observation missions , and those of the domestic observer groups , have outlined many of these significant concerns			0
‘ i hope that their final assessments of the elections will take into account the full impact of these irregularities on the outcome			0
’ @entity129 secretary of state @entity130 said the results ‘ did not represent a credible expression of the will of the @entity5 people ’			2
by @entity136 so @entity1 has ‘ grave concerns ’ about @entity5 ’s grotesquely rigged elections			0
instead of expressing his anxieties , the foreign secretary could offer the @entity5 people a heartfelt apology on behalf of the @entity142 for inflicting @entity6 on them in the first place , and then standing aside as he pillaged his country , murdered his enemies and ruined the economy			1
what has happened in @entity5 is to @entity149 ’s eternal shame			0
when the @entity152 handed power to him after the 1980 @entity155 , its mandarins muttered that @entity6 was probably a decent chap			1
it was reported that @entity5 in @entity20 strongholds were unable to cast their vote so decent that within years he had massacred thousands of @entity160 supporters of his arch - rival , @entity161			2
having eliminated his black supposed enemies , he largely left alone @entity5 ’s white farmers until the late 1990s , when he started to confiscate their farms			0
@entity90 ’s most plentiful country , once a large exporter of wheat and tobacco , soon became a basket - case			0
as the size of the economy halved , @entity6 ’s henchmen began printing money on a scale that made @entity178 ’s @entity177 look amateur			1
tyrant : @entity6 's men massacred thousands of @entity182 supporters of his arch - rival , @entity161 by the summer of 2008 , inflation had reached 231,000,000 per cent			1
a hundred trillion @entity5 dollar note was being printed when the currency finally collapsed			0
throughout the illegal seizure of farms , hyper - inflation and murders of @entity6 ’s opponents , the @entity186 merely watched			1
by contrast , it was prepared to intervene in our former colony of @entity196 , for which @entity149 has less moral responsibility			0
it keenly joined @entity129 - led wars in @entity200 and @entity201			0
such modest economic recovery as there has been recently in @entity5 owes nothing to @entity149			0
in 2009 , @entity6 was forced into an uneasy coalition with @entity21 ’s @entity20 ( @entity20 ) – the party he has just stitched up in the elections by blatant vote - rigging and intimidation			1
less lunatic economic policies were introduced			0
at the same time , the @entity30 , with their inexhaustible hunger for minerals , have been moving into @entity5			0
gold , diamond and nickel mines are being developed			0
members of @entity6 ’s regime have been enriched , and there has been a small ‘ trickle down ’ of new wealth to ordinary people			1
having ‘ won ’ 61 per cent of the vote to @entity21 ’s 34 per cent , @entity6 will probably change the constitution to give himself and his twisted regime all the powers he wants			1
the @entity20 will be written out of the political process			0
in practical terms , there is little @entity149 or any other western nation can do , other than to maintain sanctions preventing @entity6 and his cronies from travelling to @entity231 and the @entity129			1
@entity30 , which has no interest in democracy , is the foreign power calling the shots in @entity5			2
as elsewhere in @entity90 , its only concern is that there should be a strong regime with which it can do business			0
meanwhile , to their enormous discredit , most other @entity90 governments are eager to pat @entity6 on the back , implausibly claiming on the basis of reports from a small number of their own election observers that the election was fair			1
a police officer keeps watch as @entity5 waited to cast their vote in @entity253 township outside @entity113 yet the @entity256 , with 7,000 observers on the spot , says that up to one million people were unable to cast their ballots , mainly in urban areas regarded as @entity20 strongholds			2
most demeaning of all has been the response of president @entity89 of @entity90 , who has extended his ‘ profound congratulations ’ to @entity6 following ‘ successful , harmonised elections ’			1
there may be little that @entity149 can do , but @entity1 should at least speak like a decent human being appalled by the activities of a man who was put into power by a @entity149 government , and has caused so much suffering to a once bountiful country			0
most whites have long since left @entity5			0
they have a long list of justifiable grievances against successive @entity149 governments			0
but so , too , do millions of blacks who remain in the country , or have been driven out of it			0
their lives have been blighted			0
this 89 - year - old self - serving tyrant , who oddly calls himself a @entity284 , is not immortal			0
the only hope for @entity5 is that , where @entity149 and everyone else have failed , his maker will finally take action .			0
