a @entity1 politician who threatened to sue his local newspaper if they used his name without authorisation has been mercilessly lampooned on @entity5			1
@entity6 of @entity7 , @entity1 , threatened to sue the @entity8 after he was named in a story			1
among those attacking @entity6 is @entity13 despot @entity12 's official news agency , who tweeted : ' @entity15 senator @entity6 of @entity1 condemned for restricting press freedom , as @entity13 press freedom is lauded by international reporters			1
' @entity6 , pictured , @entity19 council member for @entity7 , @entity1 threatened to sue his local newspaper if they printed the name @entity6 without seeking prior authorisation @entity12 's official news service condemned @entity6 for trying to restrict press freedom soon after councilman @entity6 issued his threat of legal proceedings , @entity5 responded immediately one wag suggested @entity6 should contact @entity28 's lawyer @entity27 from @entity29 however , the newspaper struck back almost immediately , publishing an editorial which name checked @entity6 30 times as well as mentioning the hashtag # kirbydelauter , which is being used to mock him on the internet			1
also within the editorial , which runs to almost 1,000 words , the newspaper ponders whether they should ' use hyphens as in the case of expletives ' or possibly refer to him as @entity6 [ unauthorized ]			1
however , the editorial is also an acrostic puzzle , with the first letter of each of the 13 paragraphs spelling out @entity6 's name			1
many of the online commentators have questioned how the @entity19 politician will be able to sue a newspaper for using his name without permission , given that free speech is guaranteed under the first amendment of the @entity15 constitution			1
@entity6 was elected to the council in @entity7 which is approximately 50 miles away from both @entity57 and @entity58 in rural @entity1			2
as well as being attacked on @entity5 , dozens of people have commented on his @entity61 page where @entity62 pledges to ' govern like a taxpayer '			2
one commenter , @entity64 asked : ' will you grant permission for the butterknife to be renamed the @entity6 ? you know , since it 's not the sharpest knife in the drawer			2
' @entity6 pledged to the people @entity7 that he would ' govern like a taxpayer ' @entity6 attacked journalist @entity75 on @entity61 over her coverage of the controversy but on social media it appeared that councilman @entity6 was receiving very little support some @entity5 commentators highlighted the fact that @entity6 seemed to be opposed to the @entity83 of the @entity15 constitution by seeking to infringe on freedom of speech @entity6 told the newspaper : ' use my name again unauthorized and you 'll be paying for an attorney			1
' however , managing editor of the @entity8 @entity92 said : ' i just do n't know how to respond to a request that stupid			2
' mr @entity92 said it 's the newspaper 's job to hold elected officials accountable by name for their words and deeds			0
knowing councilman @entity6 as we do , we were n't surprised that he threatened @entity8 with a lawsuit because we had , he says — and we 're not making this up — been putting @entity6 's name in the paper without @entity6 ’s authorization			1
attorneys would be called , @entity6 said			2
in fact , we spent quite some time laughing about it			0
@entity6 , an elected official ; @entity6 , a public figure ? surely , @entity6 ca n't be serious ? @entity6 ’s making a joke , right ? reasonable men ( and women ) are required to move @entity7 forward			2
all @entity6 is doing yet again is displaying his inability to control his temper , embarrassing himself , his district , the county and those who voted him into office			0
if he wants to govern like a taxpayer , he needs to respect the taxpayers whose money provides his paycheck , stop this silly , inflammatory nonsense , and get to work			0
* the full editorial can be viewed on the @entity8 's website he added : ' if he does n't want to be held accountable , he needs to seriously consider whether he 's cut out to serve the public			1
' the @entity8 has a daily circulation of 33,000 , although as a result of @entity6 's reaction to the original story , the scandal has now been seen by a global audience , far outside @entity7			1
the newspaper headlined its sunday editorial , which it published online in advance , ' @entity6 , @entity6 , @entity6 '			1
entering the name ' @entity6 ' into the search engine @entity137 returns 128,000 results in 0.24 seconds			0
when approached by the @entity141 for comment , @entity6 declined to respond to telephone and email messages			0
also , during last night 's meeting of @entity147 , the politician did not address his current notoriety			0
councilman @entity6 had objected to a recent story by @entity151 that said @entity6 shared another councilman 's concern about a shortage of reserved parking spaces for council members at the county office building			0
@entity6 wrote in his @entity61 post that he had refused to be interviewed for the story because ms @entity75 had misrepresented his comments in the past			0
this is n't the first time @entity6 's quick temper and belligerent style have brought him unflattering attention during his four years as a county official			0
he stormed out of a board meeting in 2012 after telling a county staff member , ' i 'm not going to sit here and be talked to like some punk because i 'm asking questions			0
' ms @entity75 reported last year that @entity62 called another board member a ' moron ' for disagreeing with him on an issue			0
@entity178 blogger @entity177 , who teaches free speech law at the @entity180 in @entity181 , wrote online tuesday : ' in our country , newspapers are actually allowed to write about elected officials ( and others ) without their permission			0

@entity6 threatened to sue his local newspaper for using his name
he warned the @entity8 they would need an ' attorney '
the 33,000 circulation newspaper responded by printing his name 30 times
the editorial has gone viral on the internet with @entity5 attacking @entity6
