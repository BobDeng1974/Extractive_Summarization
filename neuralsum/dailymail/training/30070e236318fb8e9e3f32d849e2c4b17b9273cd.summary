when asked who would be leading the 2015 goalscoring charts across @entity4 's top five leagues , most football fans would predict that either @entity5 or @entity6 would be top of the tree			1
in fact , there 's one more very important name that has been making headlines in the @entity12 for his ability to find the net since the turn of the year			0
when @entity18 pulled @entity20 level against @entity21 on wednesday night , he joined @entity22 on eight goals for 2015 , which is more than any other player in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 or @entity30			2
@entity18 celebrates scoring his eighth goal of the year during @entity20 's 3 - 2 defeat against @entity21 @entity5 has scored eight goals in as many games for @entity22 since the turn of the year although his side ended up suffering a 3 - 2 defeat at @entity37 on wednesday , @entity18 added to his impressive tally of 13 @entity12 goals for @entity41 's side as the young striker looks to keep pace with the likes of @entity45 , who leads the way with 17 goals to his name so far			1
@entity18 's form in front of goal has been rising quickly since his headed goal against @entity53 in december , 2014			0
in fact , @entity18 had n't scored a @entity12 goal until november when @entity41 began to give the youngster a run in the team			0
since then , the 21 - year - old has bagged 12 goals in 15 games for the north @entity63 club			1
and since @entity64 , @entity18 has helped @entity20 put @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 to the sword with some sensational solo performances			2
@entity18 scored the first two of his eight 2015 goals against @entity63 rivals @entity65 on january 1 in a game which saw the youngster terrorise one of the best defences in the @entity12 as @entity20 marched to a memorable 5 - 3 victory at @entity76			1
the 20 - year - old has now scored 13 @entity12 goals for @entity20 , including two against @entity67 the former @entity80 loanee then added to his tally in the 2 - 1 defeat against @entity83 before bagging four goals in two games against @entity66 and @entity67 in saturday 's north @entity63 derby			1
@entity5 , on the other hand , has managed to score eight goals in as many games for @entity90 as the diminutive @entity92 looks to propel his side to the top of @entity95			0
a hat - trick against @entity97 on january 18 was the highlight for @entity5 , who already has 33 goals in all competitions for the @entity102 giants			0
@entity103 ( left ) and @entity104 ( right ) also feature in our top scorers in 2015 list @entity20 fans will no doubt enjoy ' one of their own ' @entity18 keeping pace with @entity5 in a list which also includes @entity112 , @entity104 and @entity113			2
interestingly , @entity6 is nowhere to be seen in our top 10 list after a difficult start to the year which has seen the @entity117 banned for two games after he was sent off against @entity120 and notching four goals - a measly tally by his almighty standards			0
the @entity20 faithful may well start to wonder how long they can keep hold of @entity18 should the young @entity26 continue to keep pace with @entity4 's elite			1
despite scoring four goals in 2015 , @entity6 has had a difficult start to the year			0

@entity18 and @entity5 have both scored eight goals in 2015
the pair top the 2015 goalscorer chart across @entity4 's five *big* leagues
@entity18 scored during @entity20 's 3 - 2 defeat at @entity21
the 20 - year - old bagged a brace against @entity67 in the derby on saturday
@entity5 has scored eight goals in as many games so far this *calender* year
