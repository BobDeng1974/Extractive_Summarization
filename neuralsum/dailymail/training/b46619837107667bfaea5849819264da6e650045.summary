in january an unannounced inspection by the @entity124 warned the @entity49 to improve its care of patients after receiving several complaints from people who had waited up to three hours for an ambulance to take them to hospital			0
later that month , police officers complained that they were having to take patients to hospital ' on a daily basis ' because no @entity49 ambulances were available , and were regularly having to wait ' an inordinate amount of time ' for their paramedic colleagues to arrive at the scene of an emergency			0
a week later , firefighters warned that something was ' going seriously wrong with the 999 response ' of the @entity49			0
they said they were waiting ' longer and longer ' for ambulances to arrive and found paramedics often arrived alone on motorbikes or cars and were unable to transport patients to hospital			0
@entity151 , of @entity152 , said : ' fire officers tell us of their desperate frustration at being told to wait in line when chasing up emergency requests for the attendance of an ambulance			0
