@entity1 's stunning red card during the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity3 was a ' moment of madness ' borne out of ' frustration ' , according to former @entity8 team - mate @entity7			1
@entity1 was sensationally sent off within 38 seconds of coming on the pitch at @entity10 , after stamping on @entity3 's @entity11			1
@entity12 left out @entity1 from the starting line - up but came on at the start of the second - half to rally the troops , however soon found himself walking back to the stands			1
@entity1 is shown the red card by referee @entity19 after just 38 seconds of the second - half @entity1 ca n't believe it after being sent off for a reckless stamp on @entity3 's @entity11 at @entity10 @entity8 captain @entity1 spoke to @entity23 after the match to apologise to team - mates and fans ' there 's no doubt that not playing at @entity29 ( in @entity8 's last game ) and then not playing this game would be a frustration , ' @entity7 told @entity23			1
' he 's been at @entity8 17 , 18 years , he 's always been the man , the captain , there 's never been a case where he 's been out of the team and as soon as he 's fit he goes straight back in the team			1
' this is the first time i think , last week at @entity29 and today , that has n't happened , so there 'll be frustration there			0
' watching the first half from the bench he 'd have been disappointed , @entity8 were n't playing well , they were losing 1 - 0			1
@entity46 ( top ) was on the receiving end of @entity1 's first robust challenge after coming onto the pitch here is the stamp from @entity1 on @entity11 after both players had competed for the ball ' but there would have been more frustration			1
i think he 'd have been watching players in his position performing not great and thinking , ' why am i not playing , why am i not on that pitch ? ' @entity7 and his @entity23 colleagues called for @entity1 to enter the fray at half - time and maintained it was the right call when he replaced @entity66			1
' @entity1 is an emotional player			2
you see that in his career and it 's taken teams i 've played in into some unbelievable moments			0
' sometimes he has n't played with his brain in terms of when he 's done well , it 's been his heart - the ( @entity76 ) cup final against @entity77 , @entity78 ( the @entity80 final )			2
that was n't @entity1 playing with a cold , calculated head , that was just playing from the heart			2
he can do special things like that , ' added @entity7			0
@entity1 clearly puts all his downwards force into @entity11 's right leg after the pair collided @entity1 flings back the captain 's armband towards his team - mates having been sent off at @entity10 a evidently devastated @entity1 leaves the pitch after just 38 seconds having been sent off ' but on the flip side of that , when he plays in games like this and he comes on maybe a bit frustrated - he 's had seven red cards in his career , four of them have been @entity101 and @entity3 , two each now			1
an @entity101 one was coming off the bench , an @entity101 one was 15 , 20 minutes into a game			0
i think the @entity3 other one was an @entity108 game in the first half and if i think right they were all straight reds			2
' there 's no doubt being a local player , the emotion of these occasions , the frustration coming into this game , has contributed to the moment of madness			0
' he added : ' it 's a straight red there 's no arguments with that			2
you ca n't do that on a football pitch , he 's been rightly given his marching orders			0
@entity1 has scored the most goals in the history of @entity8 's matches against @entity3 the 34 - year - old has played 34 times against @entity3 during his prestigious career at @entity10 @entity8 manager @entity12 felt @entity1 could have been frustrated by his side 's first - half show and acted accordingly			1
' @entity1 gave an apology to the players and himself , it was probably frustration , he 's an honest guy , very competitive and probably frustrated at the first half watching us , ' he told @entity23			1
' he 's come on and unfortunately got sent off			0
' asked if he accepted his captain 's apology , @entity12 said : ' yeah , he knows as well as anyone it 's difficult to play big games with 10 men			0
he 's a wonderful character			0
' ahead of kick - off @entity7 admitted he was not surprised by @entity12 ' decision to name @entity1 on the bench for @entity8 's crunch clash against @entity3			1
a stunned @entity1 walks off the @entity10 pitch having been shown a straight red card for a stamp on @entity11 @entity1 , who faced rivals united for the last time in a @entity8 shirt , had to make do with a place on the bench as @entity12 decided to go for a central midfield duo of @entity161 and @entity162			1
and @entity7 felt it was the right decision			0
speaking on @entity23 ahead of the @entity10 battle , the former @entity8 defender said : ' no i 'm not surprised			2
' he 's only played 20 minutes against @entity29 recently because he 's been injured			0
' is @entity1 a better player than @entity162 ? yes			0
but for @entity12 we 've got to remember than @entity1 is leaving in the summer and @entity162 will be here next season			0
so although @entity12 is aiming for the top four that certainly comes into it .			0

@entity1 was named on bench for his side 's match against @entity3
@entity8 skipper came on @entity66 at the start of the second - half
@entity1 saw red after 38 seconds for stamp on @entity3 's @entity11
