by @entity0 published : 15:50 est , 27 january 2014 updated : 19:02 est , 27 january 2014 the boss of @entity3 who this week said high energy bills in @entity5 were due to ' draughty housing ' has been accused of wasting energy at his home			1

mr @entity13 owns two homes - one a 16th century country property in @entity19 , @entity20 and another terrace home in @entity22 , south @entity23			1
@entity13 's home in @entity20			2
the thermal image shows heat escaping from the 16th century country property , say energy experts thermal images taken of both properties show they are ' far less energy - efficient than the average family home , ' @entity33 from independent consultancy @entity34 told the @entity35 on sunday			1
he added the images also indicate the houses could suffer from ' nasty drafts '			0
this week , mr @entity13 caused outrage by blaming @entity5 for sky - high energy prices			1
he said households would save money if people turned off televisions and other electronic devices - and said his teenage daughters were guilty of wasting energy			2
last week the energy boss advised @entity5 to turn off lights and electrical appliances in order to save on energy bills he also blamed the government for higher charges - saying eco-schemes were to blame for increasing costs			1
he said green taxes would push bills up to £ 1,500 annually by 2020 - a figure the industry regulation @entity63 disputed			2
@entity3 raised its prices by 10.4 per cent late last year - a move predicted to affect around 3.1million customers			0
the company have since insisted it will reduce costs as a result of government taxes			0
speaking with @entity73 's today show , mr @entity13 said : ' the reality is that we have some of the cheapest prices in @entity77 but our bills are some of the highest because our houses are old and not insulated			1
i have two teenage daughters			0
' they have been brought up in a generation that has looked at energy efficiency , that has looked at climate change			0
' they would never dream of walking out of a bathroom leaving the taps running			0
' and yet my teenage daughters will walk out of a room and leave the lights on and their @entity92 playing and the tv on quite happily			0
' so i do think we need to change our approach and the way we think about energy waste			0
' ‘ the actual unit price of energy in the @entity5 is one of the lowest in @entity77 – but bills are high because @entity5 houses waste so much energy			1
‘ if we can increase the efficiency of the @entity5 ’s old and draughty housing , we can ensure that annual energy bills are some of the lowest too			1

two homes owned by boss @entity13 are ' poorly insulated ' say experts
add both @entity23 terrace and 16th century country property are ' drafty '
