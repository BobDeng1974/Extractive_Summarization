for most youngsters , a withering personal put - down by their hero on social media would be the most crushing of blows to their self - esteem			2
but then , not all teenagers are like @entity9			1
the 19 - year - old @entity11 striker might have expected his former @entity13 idol @entity12 to be thrilled for him after he scored a stunning double in the shock 3 - 1 victory over @entity18 at @entity19 last month			1
but instead @entity9 drew fierce criticism online after boasting in a post-match interview that he had shown ‘ the touch of an angel ’ in the build - up to his opener against @entity25 ’s side			1
@entity9 accepts his award for @entity29 for september @entity9 ( left ) breaks away from the challenge of @entity32 's @entity31 ( right ) @entity9 has impressed so far this season , scoring four goals in seven @entity36 matches and one of the most scathing barbs came from @entity39 , who dismissed the player as ‘ a @entity42 big time ’			1
however , when asked about his idol ’s negative response yesterday after scooping the @entity29 young player of the month award for september , @entity9 refused to be dragged into a war of words with the man whose feats he hopes to replicate in @entity51 - and insisted he had taken his jibe as a compliment			1
‘ i ’m on social media and you always get good things and bad things			2
you just take it with a pinch of salt , ’ said @entity9			1
‘ it ’s always from outsiders , the people who are behind it are people who do n’t know what they are talking about			0
‘ i just concentrate on what i do in here and i try and take it out onto the football pitch			0
‘ i was n’t bothered about what @entity12 said - i loved it ! just for @entity12 to even tweet me was great			1
@entity9 ( second left ) celebrates with his team - mates after putting @entity11 0 - 3 up against @entity18 @entity9 ( right ) has attracted a lot of attention for his eccentric use of language ‘ i ’ve always liked him as a player and looked up to him			1
what he did here was outstanding			0
‘ the fans loved him because he scored goals and that ’s all i want to do			1
if i could do half of what he did then that would be perfect			0
‘ the fact he even noticed me shows i am doing the right things - and it ’s better being noticed than having nothing to say			2
’ @entity9 only made his @entity11 debut last season but has quickly gained a reputation for his eccentric use of language			1
the former @entity97 kid , released by the @entity99 club at 16 after suffering a knee injury , was working as a gardener just over a year ago until the @entity51 club took a chance on him			0
and he raised eyebrows last season when he described one of his two goals against @entity107 in the first - leg of their @entity114 play - off by saying : ‘ it was some zing , i opened a tin of beans there			1
’ not even missing a penalty in the second - leg shoot - out , which helped condemn @entity11 to relegation , could dent the lad ’s confidence for long			2
@entity121 's tweet about @entity9 was far from endearing , calling the @entity11 man ' # billybigtime ' @entity125 ' @entity124 ( right ) challenges @entity126 during the two sides ' recent match head coach @entity130 , for his part , has confessed that he just has to shake his head at times at @entity9 ’ wacky one - liners			1
but even though the youngster is adamant he will not change his individual off - field style , he insists that he takes his football extremely seriously			1
it ’s certainly the least @entity130 can expect with his team now 12 points adrift of @entity36 leaders @entity97 following last weekend ’s 1 - 1 draw with @entity125			2
speaking ahead of this afternoon ’s home encounter with @entity145 ’s @entity144 , a match @entity11 must surely win to retain their fading promotion hopes , @entity9 acknowledged the seriousness of the club ’s plight and the desperate need for points if they are not to completely lose touch with @entity97 and @entity18			1
but he also summed up his own off - the - wall attitude to life by saying : ‘ it ’s a short career so you need to enjoy it when it ’s happening			2
@entity9 was not the only @entity11 man to pick up an award - @entity130 won manager of the month ‘ but i do take my football very seriously			1
i try to eat well and not go out and drink at the weekend , i want to do those things right			0
i go to the gym and all that			0
‘ but when it comes to after the game i like to have a laugh			0
we had just beaten @entity18 3 - 1 - you can have a laugh then			1
‘ during the game i do n’t do that , i know you ca n’t muck about			0
‘ but when the time is right you have to have a laugh			2
if i did n’t enjoy football i would n’t play , and i want to keep enjoying it			0
‘ it ’s all about having a good laugh , is n’t it ? ‘ this is n’t a dress rehearsal , it ’s life			0
@entity186 ( @entity185 ) just taught me that one ! you have just got to try and enjoy life and that ’s what i am doing			0
i ’m still young so you ’ve got to enjoy it			0
‘ the boys have a bit of banter with me			0
someone just called me @entity195 before i came out here			2
‘ but i love it			0
they call me everything , i get all sorts , that ’s what it ’s all about			0
it ’s the job i have always wanted to do and it ’s the best job in the world for me			0
