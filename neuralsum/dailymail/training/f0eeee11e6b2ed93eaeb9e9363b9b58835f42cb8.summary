experts have used a radical new satellites to capture unique psychedelic images of the ruptures in the @entity5 's crust caused by the @entity7 earthquake			2
radar images from the @entity11 's @entity10 satellite have been used to map the biggest earthquake that has shaken northern @entity13 in 25 years			2
the images reveal the rupture is larger than previously thought			1
by processing two @entity10 images , which were acquired on 7 august and 31 august 2014 over this wine - producing region , an interferogram was generated			0
the two round shapes around @entity7 , which are visible in the central part of the image , show how the ground moved during the quake			0
the satellite uses a technique called ' synthetic aperture radar interferometry '			0
this uses two or more satellite radar images of the same area are combined to detect large - scale surface changes			2
small changes on the ground modify the reflected radar signal and lead to rainbow - coloured fringes in the ' interferogram '			0
each colour cycle corresponds to a deformation of 28 mm deformation			0
the maximum deformation is more than 10 cm , and an area of about 30x30 km was affected significantly			1
@entity42 from @entity44 's @entity43 and @entity45 from @entity46 in the @entity47 processed this new interferogram from two images : one that @entity10 acquired on 7 august , the day the satellite reached its operational orbit , and another captured on 31 august			0
it clearly confirms that part of the @entity55 system was responsible for the 6.0 earthquake that rocked @entity13 's wine - producing region			1
however , the fault had not been identified as being particularly hazardous prior to the quake that hit on 24 august			2
importantly , the extent of the ground deformation in the interferogram shows that the fault slip continues further north than the extent of the rupture mapped at the surface			1
@entity68 lines in the interferogram show minor movements on other faults , such as the part of the @entity55 system that crosses @entity7 airport			1
the maximum deformation is more than 10 cm , and an area of about 30x30 km was affected significantly			1
@entity73 , a phd student at the @entity74 , is one of the team mapping the earthquake rupture on the ground			2
researchers have also been on the ground to examine the damage to the local area he said , ' the data from satellites are invaluable for completely identifying the surface break of the earthquake â€“ deformation maps from satellite imagery guide us to places where rupture has not yet been mapped			1
' @entity91 , from @entity92 said , ' this successful demonstration of @entity10 marks the beginning of a new era for our ability to map earthquakes from space			0
' @entity101 scientists are building a system that will provide these results routinely for all continental earthquakes , as well as mapping the slow warping of the ground surface that leads to earthquakes			1
' @entity10 passes over the same spot on the ground every 12 days			0
however , once its identical twin , @entity110 , is launched in 2016 , this will be cut to just six days , so that changes can be mapped even faster			0

confirms @entity55 system was responsible for the 6.0 earthquake
reveals area of about 30x30 km was affected significantly
fault slip continues further north than previously thought
system set to be used to *monitor* all *future* earthquakes
