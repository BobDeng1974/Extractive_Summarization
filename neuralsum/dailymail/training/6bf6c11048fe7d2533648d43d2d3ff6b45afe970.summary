goats are shrinking as a result of climate change , researchers have claimed			1
they say @entity5 goats now weigh about 25 per cent less than animals of the same age in the 1980s			1
researchers say it is a stark indication of how quickly climate change can affect animals			1
the @entity5 chamois goats now weigh about 25 per cent less than animals of the same age in the 1980s			1
the chamois ( @entity12 ) is a goat - antelope species found in the mountains of @entity15 , the @entity16 , the @entity5 , the @entity17 , the @entity18 , parts of @entity20 , and the @entity21			1
it has also been introduced to the @entity23 of @entity24			2
chamois leather , traditionally made from the hide of the chamois , is very smooth and absorbent and is favoured in cleaning , buffing , and polishing because it produces no scratching			2
they are known for their amazing escapology			2
when alarmed , chamois speed to the most inaccessible places , making leaps as high as 2 meters and spanning as much as 6 meters			2
extremely nimble and surefooted , the chamois can travel up to 50 kmph over steep or uneven ground			0
alarm signals include whistling through the nose , ' sneezing ' , and stamping their feet			0
they appear to be shrinking in size as they react to changes in climate , according to new research from @entity46			0
the researchers studied the impacts of changes in temperature on the body size of @entity52 , a species of mountain goat , over the past 30 years			0
to their surprise , they discovered that young @entity12 now weigh about 25 per cent less than animals of the same age in the 1980s			1
in recent years , decreases in body size have been identified in a variety of animal species , and have frequently been linked to the changing climate			1
however , the researchers say the decline in size of @entity52 observed in this study is striking in its speed and magnitude			0
the research , funded by the @entity70 is published in the journal frontiers in @entity72			0
lead author dr @entity74 , in the @entity73 , at @entity46 , said : ' body size declines attributed to climate change are widespread in the animal kingdom , with many fish , bird and mammal species getting smaller			1
' however the decreases we observe here are astonishing			0
' the impacts on @entity12 weight could pose real problems for the survival of these populations			1
' the team delved into long - term records of @entity52 body weights provided by hunters in the @entity5			1
they discovered that the declines were strongly linked to the warming climate in the study region , which became 3 - @entity97 warmer during the 30 years of the study			0
the team believes that higher temperatures are affecting how chamois behave			1
' we know that @entity52 cope with hot periods by resting more and spending less time searching for food , and this may be restricting their size more than the quality of the vegetation they eat , ' said co-author dr @entity111			0
' if climate change results in similar behavioural and body mass changes in domestic livestock , this could have impacts on agricultural productivity in coming decades			0
' according to the authors , the future plight of the @entity52 remains unclear			0
the research suggests that declining body size is a result of changes in both climate and the density of animals			1
dr @entity129 , another co-author on the study , in the @entity73 , at @entity46 , said : ' the body mass of juvenile animals is critical to their ability to survive harsh winters			1
' however , whether that becomes a problem will depend on the balance of future climate change between the seasons			0
' the research suggests that declining body size is a result of changes in both climate and the density of animals			2
to counter declining body size in future , the researchers say it might be necessary to maintain @entity52 populations at lower densities than occur at present , perhaps through changes in hunting regulations			0
dr @entity74 added : ' this study shows the striking , unforeseen impacts that climate change can have on animal populations			2
' it is vital that we continue to study how climate change affects species such as @entity52			0
' changes in body size could act as early - warning systems for worse impacts to come , such as the collapses of populations			2
