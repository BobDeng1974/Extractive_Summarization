by @entity0 published : 07:51 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 10:02 est , 19 february 2013 banned : @entity1 , 55 , can not teach for at least two years after he admitted streaking across a field with a group of year 8 pupils a grammar school teacher who streaked naked in front of his pupils has been banned from @entity10 's classrooms for at least two years			1
education secretary @entity11 imposed the sanction on @entity1 , 59 , after a disciplinary panel found him guilty of ' unacceptable professional conduct ' while working at @entity15 , in @entity16 , @entity17			1
@entity1 , who received an mbe four years ago for his work with children on the @entity22 scheme , quit his job last month after admitting it had been ‘ inappropriate ’ to streak			1
he had been camping with the group of 12 - and 13 - year - olds on a field trip when he agreed to run naked across a garden			1
the married teacher told a disciplinary panel : ‘ the lads had streaked for a joke and they were saying , “ come on sir , you have a go			0
” ‘ at that point , for whatever reason , i got up , ran down the garden and ran back in			0
even when i did it i thought , “ what am i doing ? ” ’ the @entity40 , who announced the ban today said : ' we are satisfied on the evidence that he took the conscious decision to agree to streak , then moved out of his sleeping bag , removed his boxer shorts and then ran with pupils in the garden			2
@entity1 said that he could not explain why he had behaved in that way , but claimed that in november 2011 he was close to a breakdown due to stress and the pressure of work			2
their report went on : ' mr @entity1 confirmed that there were no complaints raised by any children , and the children had found it hilarious			1
' recommending he should be struck off the disciplinary panel said : ' teachers are expected to behave in a manner which ensures the maintenance of appropriate professional boundaries			0
' we believe that your actions in engaging in the streak failed to maintain the clear boundaries and appropriate delineation of behaviour which should exist between pupils and teachers			0
your behaviour failed to ensure the maintenance of appropriate boundaries which are essential in order to ensure that a teacher 's position of trust , responsibility and authority are upheld			0
' @entity1 had undressed in an area where children were showering during the school camping trip to the @entity89 in @entity90 and @entity91 in november 2011			1
the veteran teacher , from @entity93 in @entity94 , was also accused of inappropriately hugging a female pupil from @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity17 , where he taught			0
however , the @entity40 hearing in @entity97 ruled that undressing in front of boys while they showered and hugging the girl , who @entity1 said was hypothermic , did not amount to misconduct			1
respected : four years ago mr @entity1 was handed an mbe but has now left @entity15 in @entity16 in disgrace after the school trip the @entity105 master was awarded an mbe in 2008 for services to young people after running schemes for the @entity109 for 30 years			1
he said at the time that organising trips was ‘ normally just an excuse to have fun and enjoy the animal vitality the young exude ’			0
@entity1 , who has taught for 37 years , said he realised while streaking that what he was doing was unprofessional			2
however , referring to the accusations about hugging the girl , @entity1 said he was ‘ aghast ’ that what used to be considered normal behaviour for teachers could now cause complaints			2
‘ the thing that comes out of this is how out of date i am , ’ he said			0
‘ what is viewed as normal today seems to have gone to a frightening situation where an adult ca n’t be near to a child without being accused of something			0

@entity1 , 55 , admits he acted ' inappropriately ' by stripping
he also undressed in an area where children , aged 12 and 13 , were naked
mr @entity1 was found guilty of misconduct by the @entity40
they banned him today for at least two years
