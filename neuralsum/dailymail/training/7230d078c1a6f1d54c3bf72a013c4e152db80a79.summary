by @entity0 published : 07:10 est , 3 december 2013 @entity2 : 08:11 est , 3 december 2013 people could become infected with @entity5 – the human form of ‘ mad cow disease ’ – from blood transfusions , experts are warning			1
an independent inquiry will be carried out into the safety of blood donations following fears of infection from @entity5 , it has been reported			1
studies have revealed that one in every 2,000 @entity18 could be carrying variant cjd and this has prompted the @entity20 to call for action , the @entity15 said			1
people could become infected with @entity5 - the human form of ' mad cow disease ' - from blood transfusions , experts are warning while blood tests can not detect @entity5 , strict measures are in place to prevent the risk of infection via blood			1
@entity33 does not allow donations from high - risk individuals - such as people who have had a blood transfusion - donor blood is stripped of white blood cells , and disposable instruments are used when possible in retrieving donor tissues			1
but some experts believe more could be done			0
committee chairman @entity42 mp told the @entity15 : ‘ @entity5 is a terrible condition and we were extremely concerned to hear evidence that this incurable disease still poses a significant risk to public health			1
one in every 2,000 @entity18 could be carrying variant cjd - the disease is most likely to be caused by consuming beef that has been infected with ' mad cow disease ' ‘ although the risk of developing the disease as a result of eating contaminated beef was long ago eliminated , it is possible that the infection could still be unwittingly spread through medical procedures			1
‘ we were told that this may happen through failure to properly clean medical instruments , or , even more worryingly , through widespread contamination of the blood and organ supply			2
’ @entity33 says the @entity18 has one of the safest blood supplies in the world			0
a spokeswoman said : ‘ we are constantly looking to increase scientific understanding of risks of disease transmission through blood , organ and tissue donation			0
‘ we will submit evidence to this inquiry			0
’ @entity5 is a rare and fatal disease that affects the brain causing brain damage that becomes worse over time			0
symptoms include loss of intellect , changes in personality , loss of balance , slurred speech , blindness and loss of mobility			0
most people with the disease die within a year of the symptoms starting			0
patients usually die from an infection because they become immobile meaning they are more vulnerable to infection			0
@entity5 is thought to be caused by an abnormal protein called a prion - these prions accumulate in the brain and cause irreversible damage to the nerve cells			2
it has killed 177 people in the @entity18 - most in the 1990s and early 2000s .			2

the @entity20 has called for an inquiry after studies showed one in 2,000 @entity18 could carry @entity5
strict measures to prevent infection are already in place - high risk people are not allowed to donate and disposable instruments are used
the committee fears more needs to be done to prevent infection , such as the proper cleaning of medical instruments
