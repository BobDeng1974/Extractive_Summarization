before the digital camera was ubiquitous , photographs were such a rarity that people used to dress in their finery for their snapshots			1
and these smartly dressed prisoners were no exception as this haul of vintage mugshots shows			1
the collection of haunting portraits shows just how the practise began - in @entity13 more than 150 years ago			1
the man on the left looks thoroughly displeased at having his picture taken , while @entity18 @entity17 , who was arrested for posing as a vicar to con people			1
the 32 - year - old is seen still wearing his fake dog collar @entity23 , 36 , ( left ) was sentenced to three years for stealing			1
@entity24 , ( right ) a 39 - year - old ship 's cook , who is described as ' high - shouldered ' was arrested for refusing to give evidence in a case the vintage portraits of thieves , poachers and murderers were snapped in the jail between 1859 and 1876			1
and , while their crimes may vary - from stealing spades to conning people while dressed as a vicar - what links them is that the majority are sharply dressed , with ties and buttoned up shirts and neatly combed hair			1
the book of mugshots is held by @entity47 and @entity48 - which was the first local record office in the @entity50 and is now celebrating its centenary			1
it was the idea of @entity53 , the governor of @entity13 in the 1850s , who became concerned that too many habitual criminals were getting away			1
the police had previously relied on written descriptions to help capture criminals , but he believed these methods were too unreliable			1
instead he commissioned a photographer to take pictures of offenders , so they could easily be traced if they committed further crimes			1
@entity67 ( left ) who with his slicked back hair and curled moustache clearly wanted the camera to capture his best side , had many poaching convictions and assaulted a police constable			1
@entity74 , right , who could be posing for a family portrait here , was sentenced for stealing the book of mugshots is currently on display in the @entity47 and @entity79 , the @entity50 's first local record office details of the criminal and their crimes are all painstakingly recorded , including their trade and visage at the time he wrote : ' photography as an agent in discovering the antecedents of criminals , especially tramps and strangers , is unquestionably a very useful auxiliary and in my opinion should be brought into prison use generally			1
' the volume contains the portraits and details of about 200 prisoners - just three per cent of those in @entity13 at this time			1
they offer a rare insight into the lower classes of the late 19th century , who were rarely photographed			1
photographic portraits were expensive so the portraits which usually survive from this time are mainly of the gentry and middle classes who could afford them			2
@entity111 , archivist of @entity47 and @entity112 , said : ' commercial photography was very new and only started in the cities in the mid 1850 's , so the prison governor was ahead of his time in exploiting the latest technology			2

he was photographed in front of a fake prison back - drop , showing an open cell ' the pictures show us what life was like for the working class at that time and drive home just how hard life was for these people			1
' they bring the prisoners to life in a way that the written word alone can not do			1
' the mugshots include @entity67 , a dapper - looking 23 - year - old , who with his neat moustache and slicked - back hair , resembled a film star			1
he had many poaching convictions and also assaulted a police constable			2
