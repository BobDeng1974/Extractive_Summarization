it 's been described as a ' suicidal mission ' that is doomed to fail			1
despite this , the @entity4 project - which aims to send people to live on the red planet - has whittled down its shortlist of candidates from more than 200,000 to just 100			1
from this , a final crew of four will eventually be selected for a ' one - way ticket ' to the red planet scheduled to arrive in 2025 following a grueling seven - month journey from @entity16			1

pictured is an artist 's impression of what a colony on @entity28 could look like ' the large cut in candidates is an important step towards finding out who has the right stuff to go to @entity28 , ' said @entity35 , co-founder of the @entity37 @entity4 mission			1
' these aspiring @entity38 provide the world with a glimpse into who the modern day explorers will be			2
' the @entity44 candidates were selected from a pool of 660 candidates after participating in personal online interviews			2
they include 50 men and 50 women who successfully passed the second round			1
the majority of the 100 applicants come from the @entity53 , 31 come from @entity54 , 16 from @entity55 , seven from @entity56 and seven from @entity58			2
the full list can be viewed here			2
@entity60 , 23 , a phd student in astronomy at @entity62 , is among the hopefuls			0
the @entity4 project plans to launch a supply mission to land on @entity28 as soon as october 2016			1
a ' settlement rover ' will then land in 2018			0
the landing systems will be tested eight times before they are used to transport humans - a move that @entity4 said will make the trips ' much safer than moon missions '			1
the group said it aims to have a human settlement on @entity28 within a decade			2
journey time to @entity28 , which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit , would be around 200 days			2
she said : ' human space exploration has always interested me so the opportunity to be one of the people involved was really appealing			0
the future of humanity is in space			0
' my family is pretty thrilled			0
they 're really happy for me			0
obviously it 's going to be challenging , leaving @entity16 and not coming back			0
i 've had support from my friends and family and we can still communicate via the internet			0
' additional teams would join the settlement every two years , with the intention that by 2033 there would be over twenty people living and working on @entity28			0
there , they will collect data , plant oxygen - producing vegetation and set the foundation for human colonisation			0
in spite of the risks , more than 200,000 people from around the world applied when the @entity37 - based group called for volunteers to join the mission			1
@entity60 ( left ) is one five @entity114 who have been shortlisted for a one - way trip to @entity28 in 2025 in the next stage , which may involve ' rigorous , potentially televised competitions ' , the current shortlist will be reduced to 40			2
the time frame for this next stage depends on how long it takes the team to sort through the 100 on the list			2
candidates that were not selected will have a chance to re-apply in a new application round that will open in 2015			0
@entity127 , former commander of the @entity128 , recently told @entity129 , writing in @entity130 that the mission may not deliver on this promise			1
' there 's a great , i do n't know , self - defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up , ' @entity127 told @entity130			1
' i fear that it 's going to be a little disillusioning for people , because it 's presented as if for sure it 's going to happen			0

' there 's a great , i do n't know , self - defeating optimism in the way that this project has been set up , ' he warned @entity149 , the production company behind @entity150 , said earlier last year it will be documenting the progress of the group of hopefuls as they compete for a 2025 ticket to the red planet			1
candidates do not need to have any scientific qualifications and an audience vote will be used to make the final choice			0
any chosen @entity28 settlers will then be required to dedicate eight years of their lives preparing for the 300 million - mile ( 482 million km ) pioneering mission			1
@entity164 of the @entity165 at the @entity166 told the @entity167 that the largest risk is the huge amounts of radiation the volunteers will receive			0
a @entity172 will be launched to @entity28 in 2018 using a probe ( artist 's impression pictured )			0
this will provide proof of concept for some of the technologies that are important for a human mission echoing mr @entity127 's concerns , he said he doubts that the volunteers for this trip know enough science and technology to take the risk			1
the group had promised on its site that in 1,000 years , everyone on @entity16 will remember who the first humans on @entity28 were			0
a robotic lander and orbiter are scheduled to lift off in 2018 , followed by a scouting rover in 2020 and six cargo missions in 2022			0
the next round will include an interview with @entity4 committee members , and candidates advancing to the third round will compete against one another			1
the third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates for the potential mission and could broadcast on television and online			2
but mr @entity127 claims @entity28 should not be a target for colonisation at this point , but targets much closer need to be considered			1

the @entity4 mission aims to establish a colony on the red planet
it now has a list of 50 men and 50 women from an *original* 200,000 *entries*
this will be cut to 40 in next stages , with four chosen for the first mission
@entity127 , former @entity128 commander , said that mission may not deliver
