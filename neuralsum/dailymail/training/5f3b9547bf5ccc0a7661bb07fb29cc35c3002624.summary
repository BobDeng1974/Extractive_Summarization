' said @entity2 chief content officer @entity46			2
he added , ' @entity19 has built a huge following on tour , on nightly tv and through her bestselling books , and we ca n’t wait to introduce her breathtakingly honest and irreverent voice to our global membership			2

moving on : @entity6 says that after seven years of taunting celebrities , she 's over it - saying : ' i do n't care about @entity88 and i do n't want to talk about him anymore ' ' you end up getting so into the mix that it changes the topics of the day			2
you can sit around and complain about all that s * * t and the @entity101 all day but if you 're participating in it then what can you do ? it really did n't feel great doing the show and the only way to sort things out was to extricate myself from the entire situation			1
