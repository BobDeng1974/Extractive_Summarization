by @entity0 it is a shocking demonstration of just how distracting a text message can be			1
@entity4 cinemagoers were shown an ad with someone driving through a forest			1
however , midway through , they were sent a text message - and when they checked their handset , the on screen car careered of the road and crashed , leaving them shocked and stunned			1
a special short film aired before the feature showing the ad			2
at the right time , operators sent the text so that everyone 's phone went off			1
as they look down , the crash happens , taking them by surprise			0
all the while , film cameras capture their reaction			2
the ad , which was shown as a trailer to a feature film at the @entity47 in @entity4 , shows a point - of - view account of a person getting into their car and setting off on a drive			1
the movie theater was equipped with a location - based broadcaster that could send a mass text to everyone in the room at once			2
at the same time , a special short film aired before the feature showing the ad			2
the stunt has already become a huge hit on @entity61 , with almost 190,000 views			0
it was created by @entity64			0
the ad comes after engineers at @entity67 revealed what they claim is the world ’s most fuel efficient production car , which can do a staggering 313 miles per gallon			1
the @entity76 ‘ super efficient vehicle ’ features new construction techniques , an innovative futuristic - looking body and hybrid drive - train to dramatically increase fuel economy			0
the edgy design is intended to reduce drag and it features ‘ scissor doors ’ which were famously featured in the @entity80 , used in the @entity82 films			0
once the text was sent , cinema goers could not help themselves from checking their messages at the same time as they checked , the car suddenly careered off the mountain track , resulting in a huge crash which left patrons stunned and shocked			2
to achieve the target fuel consumption figure the @entity76 was aerodynamically optimised , adopting a classic ‘ tear drop ’ shape and using innovations such as removing traditional wing mirrors and replacing them with small cameras called e-mirrors , which transmit exterior images to interior displays			0
@entity67 ’s car measures almost four metres long and 1.7metres wide , making it similar in size to the @entity105 , yet it is just 1.2metres tall , making it a similar height to a @entity107			1
it is powered by a compact 800 cc two - cylinder diesel engine and together with the @entity111 electric motor , it car can travel over 600 miles on a single tank of fuel			0
engineers at @entity67 have made what they claim is the world 's most fuel efficient production car , which can do a staggering 313 miles per gallon the two - seat diesel - electric hybrid car emits 24 g / km of carbon dioxide , which the @entity120 auto manufacturer says sets a new benchmark for vehicle efficiency			1
the car 's fuel efficiency of 313 miles per gallon compares favourably with @entity126 's @entity125 , which typically does 44mpg in city driving conditions and @entity130 's @entity129 , which does 31mpg on average			1
in theory , it could be driven from the centre of @entity135 to the outskirts of @entity137 in a straight line , using just one gallon of fuel			0
the @entity76 was designed from scratch and is lightweight as some steel components , including the chassis , have been replaced by carbon fibre so that the car weighs in at just 795kg			0
the @entity76 ' super efficient vehicle ' features new construction techniques , an innovative futuristic - looking body and hybrid drive - train to dramatically increase fuel economy			0
