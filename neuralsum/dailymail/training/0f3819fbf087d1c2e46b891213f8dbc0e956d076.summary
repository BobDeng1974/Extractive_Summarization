as a passionate supporter of women 's rights , @entity1 actress @entity0 jumped at the chance to visit @entity5 to support a charity campaign - even though the trip fell just a few months after she had given birth to her son , @entity9			1
the 41 - year - old told @entity11 that her trip to the country earlier this year was ' humbling ' and ' fascinating '			2
she said : ' i felt strongly about going as i knew so much could be achieved with a short trip			0
i have always worked when my babies are small			0
' i carried on breastfeeding through the trip and i 'm lucky i have a husband [ @entity1 director @entity18 ] who is a committed new dad and my mum is up the road			2
i also have two little mums in the shape of my two daughters [ @entity24 , 14 and @entity25 , 10 ]			0
five pence from every bar of ( @entity38 ) red chocolate sold goes to the hospitals , maternity wards and clinics that @entity0 visited , where staff are working to prevent the transmission of @entity29 from mothers to their babies			1
@entity0 said : ' i saw first - hand how they are trying to bring an @entity58 - free generation into being			1
i had no idea that a woman could prevent passing on the disease to her child by taking intravenous drugs during pregnancy			2
' i met one woman who was late getting to the clinic so her baby was born with @entity29 but they are able to now give the baby drugs so there is a strong chance he can be cured			1
' as well as being a charity ambassador and mother - of - three , @entity0 is also currently busy working on tv show @entity76 , which has been a hit in the @entity79 and is soon coming to the @entity1 , plus another show @entity80 - yet to be aired			1
humbling trip : the mother - of - three said she was honoured to visit hospitals , maternity wards and clinics that are being supported by funds from @entity38 chocolate and the charity ( @entity44 ) she said being a busy working mother is n't tiring - in fact , she 's never felt better			1
' it 's a busy time but even though i have just had a baby , i feel really energised and in the prime of my life , ' she said			2
' i felt the same after having my first two children			0
' ' i think one of the reasons is because during pregnancy i have been eating healthily and living really well , not smoking or drinking or doing all the things you associate with not being good to your body			0
' being a mother meant @entity0 felt an instant ' kinship ' with the women she met in @entity5 even though their lifestyles are seemingly quite different			1
' i showed them my baby pictures and i met their babies , i felt like i was with my girlfriends back home , ' she said			0
' i could really identify with the women i met , maybe i have a few pairs of @entity117 more but i do n't know if that makes me any happier than they are			0
' the clinic @entity0 visited , which is helping to treat pregnant women with @entity29 , would not have been created with the support of charities like ( @entity44 )			1
pleasurable donation : simply by buying a bar of chocolate , you can help the people in @entity5 who @entity0 met busy working mother : the actress said she feels in the prime of her life at 41 @entity0 said : ' five years ago there was no maternal clinic			1
it started being run out of a corridor but is not a thriving part of the maternity hospital			0
women are becoming more empowered , more aware and less stigmatised			0
' i left feeling excited and optimistic and honoured to have been around people who give us an example of what they can do to change the face of a disease that has been the blight on our landscape for 20 years with limited funds			0
' although medical intervention is helping , it is estimated 150,000 people are infected with @entity29 in @entity5			1
@entity0 said something as simple as having access to an hiv test can make a huge difference			2
she said : ' i saw someone having an @entity58 test and it took less than ten minutes but it can change the course of someone 's life			0
' if they do n't know they have it , they could infect other people or have a child with it so just being tested can have a fundamental effect on a community			0
' while recent charity campaigns have seen people chucking buckets of ice water over themselves or daring to bare their faces on social media in no make - up , the project @entity0 is advocating is far more pleasurable			2
all you have to do is buy a special edition ( @entity38 ) red chocolate bar and you could end up saving a life			0
as @entity0 explains : ' @entity5 is a country which has made great progress in reducing the rate of mother - to - child transmission of @entity29 and , while there is still much work to be done , it shows the world the very real possibility of creating an @entity58 free generation			1
this campaign enables people in the @entity1 to help " @entity198 " through the simple action of buying a ( @entity38 ) red bar			1
' ( @entity38 ) red chocolate is on sale now , with 5p from each pack going to the @entity203 to help ensure that more mothers can have @entity29 - free babies			1
