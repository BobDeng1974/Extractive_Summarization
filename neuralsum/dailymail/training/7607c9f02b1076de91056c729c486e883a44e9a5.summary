welcome to your new home on @entity2			2
exterior solar panels are powering the dome - shaped habitat you ’re standing in			0
the high ceilings should make you feel comfortable , and there ’s a 3d - printer to make new tools			0
' it might seem far - fetched , but that ’s a scenario that might not be too far in the future when the first mission to @entity2 goes ahead - and @entity15 has been preparing for the trip with a new study in @entity18			1
' teams of scientists have been simulating @entity2 living conditions on @entity22			1
the @entity24 project , funded by @entity15 , sees crews live in a habitat in @entity18			1
the habitat has space for six people and amenities include bedrooms , a bathroom , workspaces and even a dining room ( shown in diagram ) the @entity36 and @entity37 , or @entity24 , is a @entity15 sponsored project to see how a crew would cope with living on @entity2			1
the second of three missions was completed recently and the third , lasting eight months , has just started			0
it involves crews of six living in a large dome in a remote region of @entity18 , @entity47			2
here the crew is confined to a dome 36ft ( 11 metres ) wide , with a living area of about 1,000 square feet ( 93 square metres ) , according to science journalist @entity51 , writing for @entity52 , who took part in the project			1
‘ the key to keeping everybody sane ? a sense of airiness , ’ she says			0
the @entity24 ( @entity36 and @entity37 ) mission 's crews spend months 8,000 feet ( 2,440 metres ) above sea level in a geodesic - dome habitat on the northern slope of the @entity47 volcano			1
the volcano is a barren landscape , an abandoned quarry with little vegetation that 's as similar to @entity2 ' landscape as planet @entity22 can get			1
the crew members live under @entity2 - like conditions			2
according to @entity24 ' communication latencies and blackouts , in close quarters , under strict water - use rules , etc ' are part of the deal			0
the food study was designed to test food preparation strategies for long - term space exploration			0
@entity24 aims to address problems that may be encountered in future space missions by simulating exploration in areas of the world similar to space environments			1
the aim mission , funded by @entity15 's @entity89 , the @entity90 and @entity91 , is to learn about living sustainably on @entity2			1
the third mission started on 15 october 2014 and will last for eight months , while the final mission lasting a year begins in august 2015			1
the @entity24 ( @entity36 and @entity37 ) mission 's crews live 8,000 feet ( 2,440 metres ) above sea level in a geodesic - dome habitat on the northern slope of the @entity47 ( shown ) there are six pie - slice - shaped bedrooms for the crewmembers to live in , all adjacent to one another ( shown in diagram )			1
this floor is above the ground level and also has a bathroom and an open balcony to below , making the habitat seem big so the crew does n't feel trapped each room has a bed , mattress and a stool			2
there is space under each bed for clothes to be stored			0
a 3d printer is also in the habitat to enable the crew to print new tools if they need to			0
on a future mission to @entity2 , items like a 3d printer will likely be invaluable as resupply missions will be scarce or non-existent the crew must spend the entirety of their trip inside the dome			1
they are only allowed to venture outside when wearing appropriate spacesuits , just like future astronauts on @entity2 will have to do			2
earlier this week science writer @entity132 , who took part in the simulated mission to the red planet , argued on @entity136 that the first mission to the red planet should be crewed by only women			1
ms @entity51 and five other crewmembers - three men and three women in total - spent four months in the dome on @entity18 , only leaving the habitat in mock spacesuits			2
she says it was rare for a woman to burn more than 2,000 calories a day , whereas men regularly exceeded 3,000			0
her conclusion is that sending women to @entity2 would be cheaper and more feasible than one with men			0
another study from the @entity152 reported yesterday , however , said that women were more susceptible to cosmic radiation than men , so it would be difficult to complete a @entity2 mission before they succumbed to radiation sickness			0
to prevent the crew getting claustrophobic while inside the habitat , the dome has a large ceiling and is tiered in two floors			0
regular exercise keeps the crew fit , with routines such as @entity166 often used			0
and in the project , as would happen in real life on @entity2 , the delay that would be experienced by a crew on @entity2 was simulated by a 24 - minute time delay to all communication back ‘ home ’			2
the rooms , meanwhile , are six ‘ pie - slice - shaped staterooms ’ with a mattress , desk and stool			0
and to make sure they had sufficient access to supplies , the crew was given a 3d printer to make things they may have forgotten			0
power is supplied by solar power , while a hydrogen fuel cell provides back - up power in the case that levels run too low			0
earlier this year @entity15 awarded $ 1.2 million to the @entity24 programme to continue its working studying the human factors that may affect a future crew on @entity2			1
the first two missions lasted four months , the next will take eight months and the last will take place over a year beginning in august 2015 throughout the studies , researchers evaluate how the crew copes in the habitat			1
it 's hoped the research will prove invaluable in an eventual mission to the red planet , which is expected to take place in the 2030s			1
pictured here is the kitchen of the @entity2 habitat			0
the crew were given access to the same sorts of supplies as would be expected on a future mission to @entity2			2
throughout the mission , researchers evaluated how the crewmembers cope with the conditions the crew are not allowed to leave the dome for the duration of the project except for when they do spacewalks ( shown )			2
these must be conducted in spacesuits , albeit more primitive versions of the ones that will one day be used on @entity2			0
spacewalks usually take place with just two or three of the six crewmembers @entity15 's ultimate goal is to take humans to the red planet in the 2030s			1
in december of this year they will test the @entity239 module ( seen in the centre of the image ) for the first time , which will be used to take astronauts out of and back into @entity22 's atmosphere , as well as to the red planet			1

teams of scientists have been simulating @entity2 living conditions on @entity22
the @entity24 project , funded by @entity15 , sees crews live in a habitat in @entity18
it is intended to simulated what life on the red planet might be like
the second mission has just finished , and the third has just begun
first two missions lasted four months , the next will take eight months and the last will take place over a year beginning in august 2015
the habitat has space for six people and amenities include bedrooms , a bathroom , workspaces and even a dining room
exercise is conducted regularly but the crew only leaves for ' spacewalks '
the habitat is 36 feet ( 11 metres ) wide to prevent claustrophobia
it 's hoped the project will provide data and *information* that will prove useful for a future manned mission to @entity2
