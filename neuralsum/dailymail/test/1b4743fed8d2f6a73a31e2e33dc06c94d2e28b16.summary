frogs that build underground ‘ sex nests ’ to mate with their partner have been found by a team of researchers			1
the intriguing males build these secret chambers to avoid predators			1
the discovery was made by researchers in the @entity12 forest of @entity13 do @entity14 in the @entity15 , @entity16			1
a new species of frog has been found in @entity16			1
called @entity20 , it was found to mate underground in secret chambers			1
males and females typically find a spot to mate in about five minutes			1
and the male will cover up the eggs to protect them from predators			1
shown is another torrent frog , the @entity31 frog the new species of torrent frog , reported by @entity34 , is called @entity20			1
the amphibian , part of the @entity38 lateristrigatus group , is characterised by light stripes on its size , while it is also relatively small , according to the researchers			0
and when it comes to mating , this family of frogs has a unique trait not seen in other frogs			0
they typically like to live near fast streams and , if a pair decides to mate , they will spend five minutes searching for a private spot			2
‘ the male quickly carves out a chamber by excavating the sand around small rocks at the bottom of the stream , ’ said @entity55 from @entity34			0

it was found in the @entity12 forest of @entity13 do @entity14 in the @entity15 , @entity16 once the female has laid her eggs , the male then covers up the entrance with sand from the stream			1
the reason for this is not only to protect the eggs from predators , but also from tadpoles of the species - as they are known to be cannibalistic			2
finding the frogs was n’t easy , either - they are so secretive that the researchers had to don camouflage gear in order to observe them			0
a new species of glass frog ( shown right ) has been discovered with translucent skin so you can see its insides			2
the creature , named @entity96 , was found in the mountains of eastern @entity98 and has a distinctive call			0
while most of its body is a brilliant lime green , like all species of glass frogs , the skin on its underside is see - though , making its organs easily visible			0
the animal ’s heart , liver and gastrointestinal tract are easily visible			0
scientists were surprised to stumble across the frog , given that a through survey of the region was conducted late last century , and reported their find in the journal @entity117			2
the frog was named by @entity119 who discovered it , after his mother @entity121 to thank her for supporting his interest in science , @entity98 ’s @entity118 reported .			0
