' directed by @entity52 , going @entity40 aimed to expose the secrets behind the mysterious faith followed by thousands of people including film stars @entity3 and @entity57			1
it included interviews with former senior members and officials who made explosive claims about punishments endured by members and how followers have been manipulated			2

' the documentary also claimed @entity19 chiefs hold a ' black pr package ' on @entity3 , with all the disclosures he made during auditing sessions			1
during these sessions a trained auditor asked pointed questions such as ' what are you willing for me to talk to others about ? ' @entity3 is said to have requested that his sessions were not filmed , but secret cameras were allegedly installed anyway			1

@entity198 - once a member of the @entity30 and the point of contact with @entity3 - described a prison camp where members would be forced to work 30 - hour shifts , with around three hours of breaks another senior former member interviewed was @entity206 , a former director of the church			1
he said once members reached a certain level they would see founder @entity211 's handwritten account of the creation myth			0
this states that @entity214 , a galactic dictator froze people and dropped their bodies into volcanoes , 75 million years ago			0
these spirits are said to have jumped into the bodies of newborns and are now used as the explanation for the source of all of our anxieties and fears			0
@entity211 is also said to have created ' ethics ' - a series of punishments for auditors who made mistakes			0
mr @entity206 left the church citing problems with its stance on gay rights , after his two gay daughters told him how they were being treated by members			2
the @entity239 winning filmmaker wrote an infamous resignation to @entity241 , @entity19 's chairman and @entity211 's successor , saying he was disappointed that he had failed to denounce actions of a @entity245 church against gay people			1
the documentary , based on a book by journalist @entity249 , also claims that when the church thought @entity57 was ‘ slipping away ’ during his marriage to @entity159 , it worked with him to wiretap her phone , a claim that is flatly denied			2
in an interview with @entity255 said he took great steps to ensure that those who spoke out were not put into a compromising position and he ensured he never filmed them at their homes or arrived at a meeting point at the same time			0
he added : ' i often used throw - away phones and encrypted e-mail			0
' the @entity30 , which is believed to have around 50,000 members , denied the allegations featured in going @entity40 and said the statements included were ' entirely false			1
' @entity52 ( left ) directed the documentary and interviewed senior former members and @entity206 ( right ) the documentary was screened in @entity44 on sunday evening and is based on @entity249 's book in a statement it said : ' the church has documented evidence that those featured in @entity52 's film regurgitating their stale , discredited allegations are admitted perjurers , admitted liars and professional anti-scientologists whose living depends on the filing of false claims			1
all have been gone so long from the @entity30 they know nothing of it today			0
' yet @entity52 and @entity43 stonewalled more than a dozen requests by the @entity30 to offer relevant information about them , with more than 25 individuals with first - hand information eager to speak			0
to this day , neither @entity43 nor @entity52 can deny that they have yet to present the @entity30 with a single allegation from the film so the @entity30 may have an opportunity to respond			0
the @entity30 never sought special treatment , only fair treatment			0
' since going @entity40 premiered at the @entity300 in january , the church has created a website dedicated to criticising the film and released its own version , called ' get the truth			2
' representatives also branded the documentary a ' bigoted propaganda piece			0
' other famous members have also criticised the show			0
@entity310 , a second generation scientologist and former star of ' @entity312 ' , said he thought the book the documentary was based on was full of lies			0

but you know , my religion 's fair game , i guess , " cause it 's new "			0
