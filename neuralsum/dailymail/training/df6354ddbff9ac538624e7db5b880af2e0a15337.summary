by @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 published : 17:02 est , 16 october 2013 updated : 12:24 est , 17 october 2013 more than half of couples do n’t manage to consummate their marriage on their wedding night , a new study has found - with alcohol , stress and exhaustion named as the top passion killers			1
here , four writers confess what happened that night for them , revealing that for some , it seems , passion always finds a way ... too tired and tipsy : more than half of couples do n't consummate their marriage on their wedding night @entity0 , 63 , lives in @entity20 with her second husband @entity21			1
she says : too much to drink : @entity0 's marriage did n't get off to a passionate start it was 1971 and i was all of 21			1
i 'd met @entity28 ( yes , it 's his name i began working with and it stuck , even after the divorce ) at university			1
he was handsome and funny - a dead ringer for my movie star of choice , @entity36 , and we were very much in love			1
you 'd think that nothing could stand in the way of an appropriately amorous wedding night			1
he never actually proposed , so i guess getting married was simply mutually agreed			1
it was social suicide openly to ' live in sin ' in those days			1
our mothers would probably have murdered us			2
so , off i went to church in the full white monty			2
my mother had gone into overdrive making plans for the wedding of her only child and the whole day was exhausting			2
it was a huge relief to arrive at a small country hotel in @entity56 for the only honeymoon we could afford - a long weekend before heading off for our final year at university			2
not one to miss an opportunity for residents ' past time drinking hours and the chance for a convivial social occasion , @entity3 led me , not to the marriage bed , but to the bar			1
eventually , after much imbibing , we hit the sack			2
' well , ' said he , ' i suppose we ’d better consummate this marriage			2
' i explained the room seemed to be spinning			2
i felt a bit sick ( i was n't used to drinking			1
) the feeling overwhelmed me			2
the bathroom was down the corridor			2
i ran as fast as i could , but i missed			2
i staggered back to the room , pale and shamefaced			2
' i 'm sorry , ' i sobbed and passed out			2
he spent what was left of our wedding night clearing up the bathroom			2
no wonder it did n't last - we were divorced seven years later			1
@entity1 lives in @entity84 with her husband @entity85			1
she says : virginal bride : @entity1 could n't wait to have sex did we make love on our wedding night ? you bet we did ! i 'd been counting off the minutes for over a year			1
we were @entity95 so we were both virgins , and had been waiting for the night with the keenest expectation			2
my husband @entity85 is a clergyman in the @entity98 , and some years ago a counsellor asked us why we got married			0
apparently he was expecting some pious answer such as , ' to help each other in @entity103 work '			0
we both immediately and unanimously replied , ' @entity104 '			0
why else would you get married ? wild horses could n't have kept us apart on our wedding night , on @entity108 , july 15 , 1983 , just after we finished our finals			1
funnily enough however , my mother unwittingly scuppered any sneaking off in the afternoon			0
she shared our christian values , and also had a great sense of fun and love of life , and said she fully expected @entity85 to ' take me off somewhere ' in the two - hour gap between the main afternoon reception , in @entity118 , @entity119 , and the dinner and dancing in the evening			0
i was so embarrassed at her even having these thoughts that i made very sure we did n't			1
instead , we went and had tea with friends of my parents			0
i made sure my hair remained up and tidy , leaving my mother in no doubt whatsoever that it had n't been rumpled and tussled			1
at midnight , however , we retired , sober and excited to our hotel room and enjoyed a night of madly - looked forward to - and extremely inexpert - lovemaking			0
it was worth the wait			1
@entity2 , 73 , has three children from her marriage to @entity135 , who died in 2000			1
she says : heavily pregnant : @entity2 was n't in the mood on her wedding night the morning of my wedding day , december 2 , 1977 , dawned clear , bright and frosty			1
i woke with my heart pounding , struck with such intense bridal nerves that i turned to my husband - to - be , and said ' @entity135 , we 're rushing this			0
' he did n't agree			1
we 'd lived together for ten years , i was 37 years old and our first baby was due in a month , yet still the prospect of getting married petrified me			0
i shook with terror throughout the marriage ceremony at @entity151			0
and when we drove that evening to the cosy riverside hotel we had booked for our wedding night , i was only just beginning to recover and was hardly ' in the mood '			1
dinner that night did n't help			1
the hotel chef , realising what a hugely important night it was , decided to cook a traditional @entity160 wedding breakfast for us			0
it was eight courses of incredibly phallic food			0
there were sausages with everything and a strange pyramid - shaped mountain of ice - cream to finish			0
by the time we reached the bridal suite i was not feeling at all well			0
i collapsed on the four - poster bed , and @entity135 swiftly followed			0
having consumed my share of the champagne it was n't long before he began to breathe very deeply			1
any minute now he would pass out completely			0
as i leaned over him tenderly , his eyes opened and he smiled and said ' come here , @entity178 '			0
it may not have been kind , but it was accurate - i must have been the biggest bride the honeymoon suite had ever seen			0
i suppose it 's no wonder that i laughed , hit my new husband and fell asleep next to him			0
the next morning i rang my sister and suggested she bring her whole family to our honeymoon hotel to finish the mountain of food			0
it 's a measure of my husband 's tolerance that he forgave me and it 's a tribute to our relationship that we survived our passion - free wedding night			0
@entity3 , 51 , is married to @entity196 , also 51			1
they have three children : @entity199 , 20 , @entity200 and @entity201			0
he says : ashamed : @entity3 partied while his new wife went to bed @entity196 and i had been living together for two years before we got married , on a crisp january day in @entity209 , in 1993			1
but did we consummate our new married status on our wedding night at a country house hotel near @entity213 ? we did not			0
in fact , to my enduring shame , we did n't even retire to bed at the same time			1
@entity196 was three months pregnant , her growing bump accommodated by an empire line wedding - dress , and half - way through the barn dance she made her excuses			1
but i felt an urgent need for more do - si - do - ing , so i carried on whooping it up until my new sister - in - law , @entity225 , politely but firmly told me that my place was upstairs with my bride , not downstairs twirling other women around the dance floor			0
that 's not why we did n't do it , though			1
there was just far too much to talk about , from what friends and relatives had worn , to how one or two of them behaved , to an assessment of the food , the drink , the speeches , and the look on a few faces when i referred in my own speech to our forthcoming baby			0
almost everyone knew , but not a couple of aged aunts , one of whom went alarmingly , translucently pale and blamed her slack jaw on ill - fitting dentures			0
the next morning , the slightly oleaginous hotel manager sidled up to me as we were loading our presents into the car , and in a broad @entity209 accent said : ' a very good choice , young man , if i may say so			0
' much to our amusement , he conspicuously failed to take her to one side and give me the same stamp of approval			0
it became our first family saying , and we have cited it , on and off , ever since .			0

@entity2 was heavily pregnant and not in the mood
