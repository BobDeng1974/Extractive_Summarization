by @entity0 scientists have claimed there has never been life on @entity4 - because the red planet is too cold			1
they believe ancient riverbeds on the planet were created by brief warm spells following volcanic eruptions , asteroid impacts and changes in orbit			1
but these would not have lasted long enough to allow organisms to develop , they said			1
no life on @entity4 ? scientists have claimed there has never been life on @entity4 - because the planet is too cold water - carved channels : they believe ancient riverbeds on the planet were created by brief warm spells following volcanic eruptions , asteroid impacts and changes in orbit			1
above , gully channels in a crater on @entity4 researchers studied hundreds of craters at @entity31 , a 3.6 billion year old region near the @entity33 landing site			1
their findings , published in the journal @entity36 , suggest the atmospheric pressure on @entity4 was insufficient to heat the surface above freezing when water would have flowed			0
they challenge the explanation that the liquid was caused by the planet having a dense atmosphere rich with greenhouse gases			0
planetary experts analysed high resolution digital images of 319 small craters taken by the @entity50 ( @entity50 ) to work out the atmospheric pressure at the time they were formed			0
evidence of life ? but the warm periods would not have lasted long enough to allow organisms to develop , they said			1
above , rock layers on @entity4 , which have been previously cited as evidence that it was once habitable gathering evidence : researchers carried out a study of craters at @entity31 , a 3.6 billion year old region near the @entity33 landing site			1
above , @entity33 , which has been operational on @entity4 since august 2012 they said that heat and enormous stress on an object that penetrates a thick atmosphere causes it to break apart			0
but if the atmosphere is thinner , smaller objects are able to reach the surface			0
dr @entity71 , of @entity72 , @entity73 , said that whether a meteoroid survives transit through the @entity4 atmosphere and forms a crater depends on the density of the air it must penetrate			0
ready to launch : planetary experts analysed high resolution digital images of 319 small craters taken by the @entity50 ( pictured ) therefore , the size of the smallest craters in @entity4 's river deposits yields information of the atmospheric pressure on the planet at around the time the rivers flowed			2
dr @entity71 said : ' the minimum size of craters serves as a proxy for ancient pressure of planetary atmospheres , because thinner atmospheres permit smaller objects to reach the surface at high velocities and form craters			0
' researchers compared the size of the craters to numerous computer simulations over a range of atmospheric pressures			0
they concluded the atmospheric pressure on @entity4 would have been much greater than it is today - but would have been less than required to warm the surface above freezing			1
instead , the flow of liquid on @entity4 must have formed over a relatively short time - not allowing enough time for the extended warm , wet conditions necessary for life to arise , they said			2
dr @entity71 said if his researchers ' findings are correct , then a dense atmosphere rich in greenhouse gases and water is ' ruled out , and long term average temperatures [ on @entity4 ] were most likely below freezing '			2
@entity125 dr @entity124 , of @entity126 in @entity127 , said this new field of geology is adding much needed constraints to our understanding of planetary atmospheres			0
dr @entity124 , who reviewed the study for the journal , said : ' the longevity of stable liquid water on the ancient @entity4 surface may prove to be a key factor in considering whether life could have taken hold early in the planet 's history			2
' applying the impact crater proxy to more ancient and diverse @entity4 deposits may help to further unravel the history of @entity4			2
' mystery : it comes just weeks after a white speck of ' light ' ( circled ) was captured on @entity4 by @entity33 - leading some to believe that life is thriving on the planet			1
but @entity154 said the bright spot was not that unusual it comes just weeks after a strange white speck of ' light ' was captured on @entity4 by @entity33 - leading some to believe that life is currently thriving on the planet			1
@entity160 blogger @entity159 claimed the photograph suggests there are intelligent creatures living underground			0
but @entity154 later announced the bright spot was not that unusual - and could even be a ' glint from a rock surface reflecting the sun ' .			0

scientists claim ancient riverbeds on @entity4 were created by warm spells
these arose from volcanic eruptions , asteroid impacts and orbit changes
but they would not have lasted long enough to allow organisms to develop
study was carried out on craters at *3.6billion* - year - old @entity31 region
comes just weeks after mysterious light was caught on *camera* on @entity4
