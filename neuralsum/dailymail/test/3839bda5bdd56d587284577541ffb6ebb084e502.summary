' if i lived outside the @entity125 there might be times when i 'd think " @entity127 , i wonder if i 'll make it back on the charge " but having said that , the @entity111 is just the sort of car to have around @entity117			1

he said : ' it 's quite different now though , they only do 18 races a year , i was doing 52 because i would go down to @entity153 in the winter or @entity155 or @entity156 and do all types of racing			2
' it 's so different now that you ca n't compare the life of a driver then and now			0
it 's unfortunately one of those things that has moved on and i do n't think will ever be able to move back			0
