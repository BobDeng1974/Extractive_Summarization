the chant was loud and it was pronounced			2
‘ bees up , @entity6 down ’ rang out of the not - so neutral end at @entity2 on a day for @entity4 ’s 6,000 travelling fans to savour			1
a day they again stamped their serious play - off credentials down on the @entity9 , humiliating their once superior neighbours			2
as @entity12 thundered in his second of the afternoon , boos descended down on @entity14 , who slunk back into his dugout			1
but this was n’t about @entity6 and their mounting deficiencies			1
there were hairy moments for @entity21 ’s side - particularly after @entity23 ’s 67th minute penalty halved the deficit - but they continue to chip away at those above them with a fearless way of playing the game , excitement in abundance			1
@entity4 celebrate taking the lead against @entity6 at @entity2 thanks to @entity12 ( second left ) @entity32 runs away to celebrate his second goal of the game just before the hour mark at @entity2 @entity6 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity37 6 ; @entity38 5 ( @entity39 46 , 5 ) , @entity40 5 , @entity41 5 , husband 6 ; @entity42 5 , @entity43 5 , @entity44 5 ; @entity45 6 ( @entity46 78 ) , @entity47 5 ( @entity48 62 , 6.5 ) , @entity23 5.5 subs not used : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , burn			1
goals : @entity23 ( pen ) 67			1
@entity4 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) : @entity56 6 ; @entity57 6.5 , @entity58 6.5 , @entity59 6 , @entity60 7 ; @entity61 6.5 , @entity62 ; @entity63 7 , @entity64 8 ( @entity65 60 , 7 ) , @entity32 8.5 ( @entity48 82 ) ; @entity66 6 ( @entity67 73 , 6 ) subs not used : @entity69 , @entity23 , @entity70 , @entity71			1

referee : @entity76 ( @entity77 )			0
here was a first league double over @entity6 in 23 years and still the potential for a play - off campaign , although the manager might be looking for more			1
‘ if a team puts a run together they ’ll go clear with 90 - odd points , ’ he reasoned			2
‘ if they do that , with the nature of the fixtures , teams will drop points			0
‘ the average for the play - offs has been 72 for the last five years			2
i think you ’ll need 75 minimum			0
if that ’s the case we need two more wins			0
’ every single resident of the tiny area of west @entity100 would have snatched and bitten fingers off for that if offered in august			0
the celebrations after @entity65 ’s stunning late free - kick were almost muted , such was the shock at what they ’d just seen , and delirium as @entity63 smashed in a fourth			1
the guard has been changed around these parts and , when @entity14 looks back on the video today , he ’ll have serious misgivings as to how the little upstarts five miles down the road were allowed to humble @entity6 in their own back yard			1
‘ people will look at the scoreline and think it ’s a hammering but it is n’t , ’ he said			0
sadly , @entity14 was wrong			0
what he could not legislate for was the oceans gifted to @entity64 in the build - up to @entity32 ’ opener			2
the excellent @entity64 , on loan from @entity125 , is a midfielder with the brightest of futures , someone adept at orchestrating the @entity127			0
so when he picked up possession inside his own half , looked up and just saw vacant grass ahead of him , the alarm bells should have been ringing in the hosts ’ defence			2
@entity64 went on for 30 yards , recycled possession just outside the home box and - later in the move - @entity32 manouvered enough space for himself to put his laces through a daisy - cutter across @entity37 into the goalkeeper ’s bottom left - hand post			2
the first phase of that attack gives an indication why the @entity146 have struggled so badly this term and still are n’t safe from relegation			0
that , and a failure to take their chances when on top			0
@entity47 saw two presentable opportunities go begging before @entity155 - all alone at the back post - could only skew an effort wide with goal gaping			1
@entity45 earlier jinked away from two defenders but saw a shot smartly saved by @entity56			0
@entity23 , the multi-million pound signing from @entity163 last summer , became increasingly on the periphery ; starting as one of two strikers , the @entity161 felt the need to constantly drop off into midfield , such was @entity6 ’s lack of creativity			1
all that meant was @entity47 had to fend for himself against the two aggressive central defenders @entity58 and @entity59			0
@entity23 scored from the penalty spot with 23 minutes remaining to drag @entity6 back into the game in short , @entity6 need a plan for next season - and quickly			1
even though it looks as if they will remain in the division , their supporters will not accept another campaign of stagnation			0
compare that to buoyant @entity4 , who are on a crest of a wave and unsure where the next six weeks will take them for all the right reasons			1
they grew into this , comfortable in retaining the ball after half - time and looked every bit the play - off side			1
@entity32 ’ second of the afternoon was something to behold , a wondrous strike in the same direction as his first but into the roof of @entity37 ’s net from 30 yards out			0
@entity200 went the inflatables , over went the arms in hugging celebration			0
@entity4 ’s supporters ca n’t quite believe what they are witnessing			1
to say their brand of football does not deserve these accolades would be to decry @entity21 ’s hard work over the course of 18 months			0
it is just a shame he will not see that through beyond may			0
@entity6 's @entity215 is tackled by @entity4 's @entity59 and @entity216 @entity4 goalkeeper @entity56 saves shot from @entity45 of @entity6 it ought to have been three when @entity66 blazed over from six yards but , just as the visitors looked to be cruising to the points , referee @entity76 gifted @entity6 a way back into the game			1
@entity61 was harshly adjudged to have hauled down debutant @entity222 , with @entity23 doing the rest from 12 yards			2
lanky @entity48 was a menace when introduced , almost catching @entity56 out with a cheeky lob as @entity6 pressed hard for an equaliser			2
@entity59 needed to stretch every inch of his giant frame to keep out @entity45 too			0
they ’ll need a bit more of that if this adventure is to finish at @entity233 , although the quality of @entity65 ’s late free - kick might just be even more important			1
was this @entity21 ’s best individual result as a manager ? ‘ no , and i do n’t mean that in a derogatory way , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s a big local derby and the atmosphere was electric			0
@entity4 's @entity57 challenges @entity6 midfielder @entity43 for the ball ‘ we ’ve had momentum from day one , not in an arrogant way but we have			1
the players deserve to be where they are			0
’ they were n’t finished there , @entity63 hammering home in stoppage - time to cap off a stunning move			1
the key for @entity21 is @entity4 possess both class and guts in spades			2
@entity253 better watch out on monday .			0
