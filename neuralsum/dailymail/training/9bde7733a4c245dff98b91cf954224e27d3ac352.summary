by @entity1 reporter skin saver ? @entity3 now making its way into skincare with organic brand @entity7 set to release a citrus and kale serum next month just one cup of chopped kale contains 206per cent of your recommended daily intake of vitamin a , 134per cent of vitamin c , and a whopping 684per cent of vitamin k - but would you put it on your face ? the superfood is now making its way into skincare with organic brand @entity7 set to release a citrus and kale serum next month			1
with added ingredients like spinach , broccoli , avocado , lemon , and grapefruit , the $ 110 serum claims to brighten and lighten sun - damaged skin , prevent inflammation , and reduce fine lines and wrinkles			2
spinach is loaded with beta - carotene and lutein , two nutrients that have been shown to improve skin elasticity , according to a study in the @entity40			0
meanwhile avocado - applied topically - has long been touted to moisturize the skin , treat sunburn and reduce wrinkles , and grapefruit , ; oaded with vitamin c , helps fade spots by reducing excess production of skin pigment			1
and kale 's vitamin k , which in the body plays a major role in helping blood to clot properly , is often used topically to treat rosacea , remove spider veins and stretch marks , and speed up skin healing after surgery - reducing bruising , swelling and scars			1
dr @entity58 , who is behind the skin care brand nourish and who recently launched a kale anti-aging eye cream , told @entity62 that ' kale is a super-food with one of the highest levels of beneficial vitamins , particularly vitamin @entity68 from salad to skin : with added ingredients like spinach , broccoli , avocado , lemon , and grapefruit , the serum claims to brighten and lighten sun - damaged skin , prevent inflammation , and reduce fine lines and wrinkles ' we know that topical addition of vitamins can be up to 100 times more effective for the skin , ' she explained			1
' it just makes sense to use this ingredient as a powerhouse to re-invigorate the skin			0
its delicate effectiveness makes it particularly suitable for around the eye			0
' @entity91 's @entity90 promises to protect skin elasticity , reduce the appearance of wrinkles and redness whilst promoting healing and a reduction in puffiness			2
but while the benefits of eating kale , which is also loaded with antioxidants that can quench free radicals , have been proven time and time again , the dark green leaf still needs further study when it comes to its effectiveness in skin care according to dermatologist dr. @entity109			0
' @entity3 has the potential to be a great anti-aging ingredient and could potentially even help boost the protective effects of sunscreen , ' dr. @entity110 told @entity115			2
' but it still needs further study to ensure that those effective ingredients can penetrate the surface layers of the skin , and are stabilized in such a way as to still be effective by the time they reach the skin			0

@entity3 is high in vitamin k , which is used to treat rosacea , remove spider veins and stretch marks , and reduce bruising , swelling and scars
