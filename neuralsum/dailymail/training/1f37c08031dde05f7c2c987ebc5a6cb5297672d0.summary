by @entity0 click here to see the final leaderboard from @entity3 it was certainly a respectable defence from a champion who enjoyed his victory as much as any of his illustrious predecessors			1
if @entity9 could not quite muster the game needed to retain the @entity10 , the fact that he did more than just hang around for four days – almost cracking the top 20 – meant a great deal			1
as for how it felt to be leaving @entity14 knowing that someone else had just taken his crown ? well , in true @entity18 style , the ultra-positive @entity9 merely sees it as the ideal motivation to reclaim the title he values so dearly – when @entity22 returns to the @entity23 in 12 months ’ time			1
asked for the exact location of the empty spot where the trophy had spent the last year , @entity9 laughed as he said : ‘ my heart … yeah , i just kind of carried it around			1
but it ’s a good motivating factor for me , knowing how great it felt to win this tournament – and makes me want to work harder and get ready and prepared for @entity51 next year			1
‘ i ca n’t think of a better site or golf course to win any tournament ever than @entity51			1
and to have @entity22 back is a great opportunity			1
and i ’ll be working hard to try to get it back			0
’ revealing the details of a conversation with @entity60 chief executive @entity59 at the back of the 18th green on sunday , @entity9 said : ‘ he was just thanking me - and i was thanking him for a great year			1
we ’ve been in touch a lot this year and he ’s been terrific			2
‘ he ’s done such a great job with the @entity60			0
and it ’s been fun representing him , the @entity60 and @entity22			2
‘ coming here , i played about as well as i could			0
i did n’t score quite as well as i could , but i played about as well as i could			2
in looking at the lead going into today ’s round , from the way that i teed off on thursday and friday , i was only a few shots off the lead			2
and i think that shows that my game is not far off			0
‘ to win this tournament you need to not only play great golf , but you need to have a few breaks and you need to have luck			0
’ under the weather : @entity9 did not do enough over his four rounds to challenge the leaderboard while @entity9 , who shot a 68 to finish five - under and tied 23rd for the tournament , hopes to mount another challenge next summer in the @entity91 , the achievement of @entity86 in winning his third major has some predicting a new era of domination by the young @entity94			1
cautioning against getting carried away , the 44 - year - old said : ‘ well , you never can discount it - we used to say there will never be another @entity98 , and then along came @entity99			2
you never want to discount the possibility of someone coming along and dominating			0
‘ but nobody has really asserted themselves week in and week out the way @entity99 did for such a long period of time			0
we ’ll have great performances , like @entity86 this week			0
like @entity107 at the @entity108 , and so forth			0
but it ’s very hard to do that week in and week out the way @entity99 did			0
that ’s why it was so impressive what he did			0
’ all smiles : he has vowed to return better next year for @entity22 at @entity51			1

@entity9 finished tied for 23rd after going in as defending champion
the @entity42 *memorably* mounted a late charge on the final day in 2013
but the left - hander was unable to retain his title at @entity14
he shot a final - round 68 in a gallant push to crack the top - 20
he described his final score of five - under - par as ' *disappointing* ' but promised to increase his efforts to win @entity22 at @entity51 next year
