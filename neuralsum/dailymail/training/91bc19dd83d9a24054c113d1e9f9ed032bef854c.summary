it 's very unlikely that anyone on @entity6 will ever enjoy a flight over the huge asteroid @entity9 , the second - biggest in the asteroid belt - but @entity2 's satellite @entity3 has created the next best thing			1
the @entity2 video ' flyover ' has revealed that @entity9 is a ' building block ' of a planet , with an iron core , like @entity6 , which formed in a similar way to our planet and our own moon			1
the video was created from @entity3 's collection of images built up since it entered orbit in july 2011 , including the first looks inside mysterious craters first spotted by the @entity28 space telescope			1
' @entity3 's residence at @entity9 of nearly a year has made the asteroid 's planet - like qualities obvious and shown us our connection to that bright orb in our night @entity71 now see @entity9 as a layered , planetary building block with an iron core â€“ the only one known to survive the earliest days of the solar system			1
the asteroid 's geologic complexity can be attributed to a process that separated the asteroid into a crust , mantle and iron core with a radius of approximately 68 miles about 4.56 billion years ago			1
the terrestrial planets and @entity6 's moon formed in a similar way			1
@entity3 observed a pattern of minerals exposed by deep gashes created by space rock impacts , which may support the idea the asteroid once had a subsurface magma ocean			2
a magma ocean occurs when a body undergoes almost complete melting , leading to layered building blocks that can form planets			0
other bodies with magma oceans ended up becoming parts of @entity6 and other planets			1
scientists now see @entity9 as a layered , planetary building block with an iron core - the only one known to survive the earliest days of the solar system although @entity9 and its family are located between @entity49 and @entity50 , smaller pieces of these asteroids can be found in meteorite collections on @entity6 , including most eucrite , howardite and diogenite meteorites data also confirm a distinct group of meteorites found on @entity6 did , as theorized , originate from @entity9			1
the signatures of pyroxene , an iron - and magnesium - rich mineral , in those meteorites match those of rocks on @entity9 's surface			2
these objects account for about 6 percent of all meteorites seen falling on @entity6			1
this makes the asteroid one of the largest single sources for @entity6 's meteorites			1
the finding also marks the first time a spacecraft has been able to visit the source of samples after they were identified on @entity6			2
scientists now know @entity9 's topography is quite steep and varied			0
some craters on @entity9 formed on very steep slopes and have nearly vertical sides , with landslides occurring more frequently than expected			2
another unexpected finding was that the asteroid 's central peak in the @entity144 basin in the southern hemisphere is much higher and wider , relative to its crater size , than the central peaks of craters on bodies like our moon			0
@entity9 also bears similarities to other low - gravity worlds like @entity155 's small icy moons , and its surface has light and dark markings that do n't match the predictable patterns on @entity6 's moon			2
' we know a lot about the moon and we 're only coming up to speed now on @entity9 , ' said @entity164 , a framing camera team member at the @entity165 in @entity166 and the @entity167 in @entity168			0
' comparing the two gives us two storylines for how these fraternal twins evolved in the early solar system			0
' @entity3 has revealed details of ongoing collisions that battered @entity9 throughout its history			0
@entity3 scientists now can date the two giant impacts that pounded @entity9 's southern hemisphere and created the basin @entity179 approximately 2 billion years ago and the @entity144 basin about 1 billion years ago			0
@entity144 is the largest impact basin on @entity9			0
' the large impact basins on the moon are all quite old , ' said @entity184 , a @entity3 participating scientist from the @entity185 in @entity186 , @entity187			0
' the fact that the largest impact on @entity9 is so young was surprising			0

*ancient* asteroid has iron core , like @entity6
formed in similar way to our own planet
