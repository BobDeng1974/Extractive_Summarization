by @entity0 published : 04:18 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 06:17 est , 1 june 2012 a video of a circus show where rollerskating baboons and skipping bears are forced to perform up to three times a day , has emerged from @entity6			1
the footage has been greeted with horror by animal welfare groups , who declared that the show ' has no place in civilised society			1
' filmed in secret by a western visitor to the country , the clip shows how the @entity19 pariah state still allows the type of animal shows banned in most of the world generations ago			1
but they force him to continue jumping up and down in a cruel fashion			0
the baboons , dressed in blue and white jumpsuits , are forced to skate down a slide on roller blades , and throwing balls into basketball nets			0
strict rules : as one bear takes centre stage , another miserable - looking beast lines up patiently to perform life of misery : the bears are caught in the forests of @entity6 and trained for the show tickets to the @entity64 show , cost up to £ 16 each – compared to the average @entity6 worker ’s monthly salary of £ 29			1
this means that only privileged members of the military can afford this type of expensive entertainment – as shown by the almost entirely green uniformed audience			2
the 3,500 onlookers smiled and laughed as the bears followed the commands of their trainers – eventually showing their approval with synchronised clapping at the end of the performance			1

animal rights campaigns @entity82 reacted angrily to the video , and told the @entity84 the animal performance shows were ' outdated			0
' jumping through hoops : the audience are amused as the monkeys skate along the floor with hoops on their heads sick show : the baboons , dressed in blue and red jumpsuits , are forced to skate down a slide on roller blades , and throwing balls into basketball nets regimented choreography : a muzzled bear holds a hoop for a baboon to jump through ' there ’s nothing funny about tearing primates away from their protective mothers shortly after birth and forcing them to perform silly tricks			2
' these highly social animals suffer from debilitating loneliness and depression when isolated from other monkeys			0
a spokesperson also said that many of the animals retaliate and are known to bite people			0
' many bear cubs taken from the wild die before the training begins because of the stress of capture , the gruelling transportation conditions , starvation , dehydration and rough handling			0
' the ones who survive have the tops of their muzzles pierced with hot needles and a rope threaded through the holes – they are then forced to stand on their hind legs and perform under threat of punishment			0
' these and other animal acts are outdated and have no place in any civilised society			1
