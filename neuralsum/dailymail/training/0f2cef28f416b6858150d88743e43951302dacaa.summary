most controversial omission of the night was @entity2 's @entity1			1
the 20 - year - old striker turned up to pre-season training overweight and has struggled for form since , enduring criticism from fans and media			1
despite being @entity2 's record signing , he was dropped to the bench on wednesday night , rather like @entity11			1
striker @entity1 was left on the bench by @entity2 during wednesday 's @entity14 clash @entity15 must linger for longer @entity15 is pretty proud of his 17 consecutive years in the @entity14 but he 'll have to go some way beyond his 65th birthday to match @entity2 's run in @entity19			2
this is the 50th consecutive year the @entity22 champions have qualified for @entity19 competitions			0
@entity24 boss @entity15 celebrated his 65th birthday with a dramatic 2 - 1 victory in @entity22 the @entity26 ? @entity27 and @entity28 used to call their matches the @entity30 based on the ease with which you can travel between the towns thanks to the motorway			2
so @entity24 v @entity2 should by rights be the @entity26 , with both clubs located within two miles of the respective stations at @entity40 / @entity39 and @entity41			0
a throwback to @entity43 @entity24 fans of a certain age would have felt at home at @entity2 ’s @entity47			1
not only was there safe standing for both sets of supporters — something fans want at the @entity53 — but the ground is compact with terraced houses and bars adjacent to two sides of the stadium , a throwback to the @entity43 days			0
like our @entity60 here .			0

record signing @entity1 failed to make it on to the pitch
striker has struggled for form and *fitness* this season
@entity24 fans felt at home at @entity47
