the flag - burning father of a runaway @entity3 jihadi schoolgirl yesterday admitted taking his daughter to an extremist rally when she was 13			1
@entity6 – who blamed police for failing to stop his daughter fleeing to join is earlier this year – conceded the teenager was ‘ maybe ’ influenced by the rally organised by banned terror group @entity11			1
mr @entity6 told @entity12 last month , after his daughter @entity13 fled to @entity14 aged 15 , that he could think of ‘ nothing ’ to explain why she and two friends had decided to join @entity8 , as well as keeping quiet about his own links to radicalism			1
also at the rally were hate cleric @entity35 and @entity36 , one of the killers of fusilier @entity38			2
he has now apologised for attending , but admitted going to two further rallies – with his impressionable daughter in tow			2
one took place outside the @entity44 embassy in @entity26 , in 2013 , and is said to have been organised by the @entity25 extremist group @entity11 , founded by hate cleric @entity46 and linked to many @entity25 terror atrocities of the past decade			0
yesterday mr @entity6 , who went to this rally and another similar one with his daughter and wife @entity49 , conceded they might have influenced the youngster , who would have been 13 at the time			1
‘ the only reason we took her first time , was because there was no one to look after her and we both felt it important to go , ’ he said			0
the rally was held against the treatment of @entity63 in @entity44 after human rights violations , and mr @entity6 , 47 , who is from @entity63 , said : ‘ we both lost many people back home , we wanted to try to get help for people back home , too many human rights violations there			1
’ @entity20 was one of three girls from @entity74 in @entity26 who flew to @entity75 before being smuggled across the border into @entity14 in february			2
soon after , in an extraordinary exchange at the home affairs select committee , mr @entity6 blamed the authorities for failing to stop his daughter running off to @entity14			1
asked by chairman @entity82 if @entity20 had been exposed to any extremism , mr @entity6 replied : ‘ not at all			1
’ yesterday respected analyst @entity85 , senior fellow at @entity86 for the @entity87 at @entity88 , tweeted : ‘ remember that @entity13 ’s father blamed the police for his daughter going to @entity14 and effectively misled @entity91 with this nonsense			1
’ mr @entity6 told the @entity93 yesterday that he felt ashamed to have been at the flag - burning rally			1
he said : ‘ i went to show my feelings because my religion was being insulted , my faith			0
protesting is not radical , it is our right			0
’ @entity13 , pictured , was one of three girls who flew from @entity104 to @entity75 before crossing to @entity14 asked why he was pictured at the front of the mob , he said : ‘ the crowd pushed me			2
i did not know who they [ the organisers ] were			0
i just followed the crowd , i feel ashamed			0
’ mr @entity6 came to @entity3 from @entity112 in 1999 and said he came ‘ for democracy , for the freedom , for a better life for children , so they could learn @entity117 ’			1
he said he was upset with his daughter joining @entity8 , saying she was ‘ just a normal kid who is a victim of extremists ’			0
mr @entity6 said he felt ‘ terrible ’ to know he had been protesting with one of mr @entity38 ’s killers and said : ‘ it was brutal , it has nothing to do with @entity25 , it is not human			1
you do n’t do things like this			0
’ @entity20 fled to become a ‘ jihadi bride ’ with her friends @entity129 , 15 , and @entity130 , 16			0
a fourth girl from their school , @entity131 , left for @entity14 in december			0
giving evidence to the @entity12 ’ committee , mr @entity6 accused police of not doing enough to warn him and other parents			2
last night @entity139 mp @entity138 , who sits on the committee , said : ‘ i would certainly be in favour of mr @entity6 being recalled to give him a full opportunity to explain what he clearly did not when he appeared before us			2
‘ it ’s shocking and outrageous anyone would think it appropriate to take their 13 - year - old to such a rally			0
but then to tell a @entity153 committee you have no idea why a young teenager should seek to travel to @entity14 , when you have taken her to more than one of these events , is simply breathtaking			0

@entity6 said maybe his daughter was influenced by attending a rally
@entity13 was one of three teenage girls who fled to @entity14 in february
mr @entity6 attended one rally *alongside* one of @entity38 *'s* killers
he said he moved to @entity3 in 1999 for freedom and democracy
