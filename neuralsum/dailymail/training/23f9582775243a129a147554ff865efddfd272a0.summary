some scientists think that robots such as @entity2 could become our friends and relieve loneliness because they can read human emotions robots may often be depicted as lowly mechanical servants in sci - fi films , but experts believe they could become our friends and even provide enjoyable company			1
@entity13 scientists are trying to create eerily human - like machines with a ‘ presence ’ , while others think that looks do n't matter			1
the race is on to build bots that can adeptly read human emotions and respond appropriately - with an ' affordable ' plastic robotic companion launching in february			1
@entity2 is about to enter homes and act a useful companion			0
it has flashing lights and wheels , but asks humans questions about their feelings , such as whether they are stressed , to act like a concerned friend			0
launched by @entity13 ’s biggest phone mobile carrier , softbank , it is intended to be a member of the family and the first ‘ affordable ’ humanoid , costing 198,000 yen ( £ 1,130 or $ 1,900 ) when it goes on sale in february			1
the humanoid is designed to read nonverbal social cues by scanning human faces and listening for strain in voices			1
this data is run through an algorithm to calculate a person ’s mental state and it learns to please them			0
by spending time with a human and learning what they like , the robot can make someone feel as if they are accepted and understood , its makers claim , even if the machine does n't resemble a human			1
many scientists are exploring whether robots could help look after isolated people			0
the potential is great for intelligent machines as the number of elderly requiring care is expected to soar in rapidly - aging @entity13 in coming years and companion bots , such as @entity66 's @entity65 pet dog have already been accepted in homes			1
@entity68 , a renowned robot designer at @entity69 in western @entity13 has created @entity70 – a realistic life - size female robot , which costs $ 110,000 ( pictured )			1
he thinks that robots with a human - like presence could relieve loneliness because humans will be able to build relationships with them robotics are already used to check on the elderly and monitor their health and safety , but they might also play a role in reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation			1
recently , scientists have been creating increasingly sociable machines that interact in a more human way			2
they argue that these sociable droids make it easier for humans to work with machines and that a mechanical companion could improve a human ’s quality of life			1
@entity95 , a roboticist at the @entity96 , concedes that human company is preferable to a robot , but a robotic companion could be helpful and easy			1
‘ we understand robots are machines			2
but we can create harmony between the two , robot and human , he told @entity107			2
his view is shared by others such as @entity110 , a professor of @entity111 at @entity69 , who has created a baby - faced robot called @entity113			1
he is interested in how people use nonverbal forms of communication to form a relationship with each other and thinks that understanding it more would lead to more ' natural ' human - robot relations			1
mobile carrier , @entity121 , said its robot , named @entity2 , will go on sale in @entity13 in february for 198,000 yen ( £ 1,130 or $ 1,900 )			1
@entity121 chief executive @entity124 is shown interacting with the robot , which is designed to read human emotion by scanning people 's faces and analysing their voices the prospect of robot overlords , friends and lovers has been the topic of science fiction novels for years			1
but according to one mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness , emotional machines will never exist			2
this is because computers ca n't handle any process that completely integrates information , so they can not be conscious and capable of feeling , one expert claims			2
a mathematical framework for consciousness , developed over the last decade by @entity149 at the @entity150 , shows that computers can not handle the complex processes needed to mesh pieces of information together seamlessly			0
if consciousness is based on the integration of lots of pieces of information , computers ca n’t be conscious and capable of experiencing emotions like humans			0
professor @entity110 has developed a new brain - scanning technique that lets him track the emotional bonds that form between a mother and child in real - time			0
it involves placing both participants in a machine and showing them each other ’s facial expressions on a computer screen			0
he hopes to learn whether the pair ’s brainwaves become synchronised			0
‘ these kinds of findings will be very helpful for us in designing a robot that can synchronise or create artificial empathy , ’ he said , explaining that such information could help a robot decide which actions to copy and how it should react			1
if this happens , these robots may make excellent teachers or companions that can effectively show empathy			2
@entity68 , a renowned robot designer at @entity69 in western @entity13 places emphasis on looks - as well as a humanoid 's intelligence			1
he has created @entity70 – a realistic life - size female robot , which cost $ 110,000 ( £ 68,671 ) to make			2
she wears human clothes , has realistic - looking hair and eyelashes and moves as naturally as technology currently allows			2
dr @entity68 is known for his detailed creations and is fascinated by ‘ the uncanny valley , ’ which is the sense of dread caused by a robot that comes close to human likeness but fails to fully achieve it , perhaps through jerky movement , or lack of eye contact			1
he believes it is a matter of time before the problem is eliminated , with the help of better actuators to make movements smoother , for example			0
he said : ‘ my goal is not just to create a humanoid but to understand the feeling of a presence			1
what is that ? i want to understand what is a human , and what is a human likeness			0
’ @entity220 - based mobile carrier @entity121 has unveiled pepper the robot , which can read human emotions			1
@entity2 uses an ' emotional engine ' and a cloud - based artificial intelligence to study gestures , expressions and human speech tones			2
the robot is designed to be a friend to humans			0
the 48 inch ( 121 cm ) ( 48 inch ) tall , 62lb ( 28 kg ) white @entity2 has no hair , but two large doll - like eyes and a flat - panel display stuck on its chest			0
the machine has gesticulating hands , but can not be said to be realistic			0
besides featuring the latest voice recognition , @entity2 is loaded with more than a dozen sensors , including two touch sensors in its hands , three touch sensors on its head , and six laser sensors and three bumper sensors in its base			0
it also has two cameras and four microphones on its head and has @entity253 and ethernet networking capabilities			0
the robot can even dance and tell jokes			0
it will go on sale in february for 198,000 yen ( £ 1,130 or $ 1,900 )			0
academics have partnered with @entity260 in a bid to bring human - like robots closer to reality			1
@entity260 developed a system , that helps computers distinguish between individual objects ( pictured ) and aims to improve visual recognition systems using deep learning , as well as help machines understand humans more easily @entity260 has teamed up with @entity273 's artificial intelligence ( @entity274 ) teams to help machines better understand users , and improve visual recognition systems using deep learning			0
this partnership follows reports @entity260 is also developing superfast ‘ quantum ’ chips modelled on the human brain , to make searches and software more intuitive			1
@entity287 will be working with two of @entity273 ’s @entity274 research teams - one to help machines better understand what humans are saying to them and another to improve image recognition systems			0
and he thinks when this presence , or sonzai - kan is created , they can be used to relieve loneliness and become our friends			2
dr @entity68 believes that such robots could be used as a medium through which distant friends and family could communicate , or even as an extension of the self			0
at the other end of the scale , @entity310 , of @entity311 in @entity312 , says human resemblance is unimportant in robots and people can develop feelings about their cars and vacuum cleaner , for example			0
experts say they have seen cases where people want to give their robotic hoover a break from work , or ask for repairs to bomb disposal bots that have saved their lives , because they feel emotionally attached to them			0
while this might make robots natural companions for some people , @entity329 , director of @entity331 ’s @entity330 and the @entity332 , warns that they merely provide an illusion of a relationship , which could lead to some vulnerable people becoming more depressed or isolated , due to failed interactions .			2

@entity13 expert is trying to create human - like machines with a ‘ presence ’
@entity68 , a robot designer at @entity69 in western @entity13 thinks once this is achieved , they will be accepted as human companions
experts think *successful* droids will be able to synchronise emotions with a human companion so a relationship can be built
an ' affordable ' droid called @entity357 will launch in @entity13 in february
it will be able to scan human faces and listen to voices to guess how a human is feeling , and learn to do things to make them happy
