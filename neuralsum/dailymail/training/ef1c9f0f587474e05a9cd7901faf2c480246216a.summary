@entity8 , a 1977 graduate of the prestigious @entity10 college who was the president of her class , was catapulted to fame last year when she wrote a column offering female college students advice on how to find a husband			1
the controversy stirred by the op - ed resulted in a book deal for the outspoken mrs @entity5 , who last march released her self - help bestseller titled @entity22 : advice for finding @entity24			0
in december , @entity8 dived head - first into the @entity45 rape scandal , claiming that sexual assault could be a ' learning experience ' for female students			1
during an interview on @entity50 , @entity8 described rape as a ‘ clumsy hook - up melodrama ' and criticized women who find themselves in a precarious situation for not telling the man they 're with to stop and leave			0
@entity5 's pearls of wisdom : @entity8 , a 1977 graduate of the prestigious @entity10 college , was catapulted to fame last year when she wrote a letter offering female college students advice on how to find a husband @entity8 sounded a similar note a month later in her appearance on @entity65 , during which she once again weighed in on sexual abuse			1
at her appearance , @entity8 came out strongly against teaching children about rape and molestation in schools , saying that sexual assault often can be chalked up to ' bad manners			1
' these recent pronouncements on the subject by @entity5 have led a group of 123 @entity3 alumni to speak out against her this week in a letter published in the @entity79 , the university 's student newspaper			1
‘ we believe we speak for the great majority of @entity3 moms and dads , as well as alumni who do not have children , in saying rape in general — and date rape in particular — is inexcusable , rape survivors deserve our help and support and anyone who sexually assaults another person should be prosecuted legally , ’ the open letter read in part			1
the alumni behind the strongly worded missive went on to accuse @entity8 of shaming victims of rape by placing the blame squarely on them			0
‘ rape and sexual assault are violent crimes against persons of any gender , ’ the letter stated			2
‘ it is particularly disturbing when college students violate the trust of people they know			2
’ the group of alumni brought up another letter , penned by @entity8 herself to the @entity79 in march 2014 , in which she compared a woman who gets raped to someone who does n't look both ways before crossing the street and gets hit by a car			2
in response to her controversial comments at the time , more than 200 faculty members signed an open letter to the student paper speaking out against @entity8 and expressing their support for victims of sexual abuse			1
bestselling author : the controversy stirred by @entity8 resulted in a book deal for the outspoken @entity10 graduate ( left ) , who last march released the self - help opus @entity135 : advice for finding @entity24 ( right ) ‘ yet the wider world continues to see this woman dressed in orange and black associating her out - of - touch personal beliefs with our alma mater , ’ the 123 @entity3 graduates stated this week			2
‘ we — along with many other alumni — see these views as outrageous and unworthy of being associated with @entity3			0
’ the alumni concluded their letter by calling on the @entity3 administration to continue striving to create a climate where accusations of sexual abuse are taken seriously			0
class of 1978 graduate @entity153 , who spearheaded the open letter against @entity8 , said that unlike her previous relatively harmless remarks urging young women to lose weight and get regular manicures in order to land a good husband , her opinions on campus rape could prove ‘ actively damaging			1
’ ‘ with this , i strongly felt she was really , really undermining the young women who might have finally gotten the courage to come forward if they were raped by an acquaintance or on a date , ’ ms @entity153 told the @entity164			0
speaking to the @entity164 , @entity5 said some of her comments have been taken out of context			0
school colors : the alumni have accused @entity8 of going around dressed in @entity3 's colors of orange and black and making herself out to be the voice of the university ‘ i have never said that rape is a learning experience			1
what i said is when women drink a little bit , get a little tipsy , have consensual sex with a man they know they should n’t have had sex with and wake up in the morning and think , “ @entity189 , what did i do ? ” — that is not rape			0
it ’s a learning experience , ’ she said			0
@entity8 also has denied the alumni 's claim that she has appointed herself a spokeswoman for the university by using the moniker @entity5 and wearing the @entity10 school ’s colors			2
' i 'm speaking for myself , ’ she insisted .			0
