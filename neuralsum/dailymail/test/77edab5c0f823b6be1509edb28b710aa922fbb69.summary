up to 100 @entity1 teachers could be banned from working in schools for life following an investigation into their alleged links to the @entity7 scandal			1
it is understood a teaching watchdog is working on possible disciplinary cases against current and former staff members at some schools in @entity13 where extremist @entity1 views were being forced on pupils and staff			1
this includes allegations an @entity20 style video featuring masked gunmen was copied in a classroom and teachers punished pupils by making them kneel on tiles			1
more than 50 teachers - called the @entity26 - also alleged exchanged as many as 3,000 messages in a @entity29 group which included offensive comments about @entity32 soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier @entity34 was a hoax			1
the probe into the @entity1 plot last year found evidence of anti-western rhetoric , intolerance towards gays and creating the perception of a worldwide conspiracy against @entity64			2
@entity65 , @entity66 , @entity37 - all run by the @entity67 and @entity68 in @entity13 were placed in special measures after inspectors found systemic failings in safeguarding pupils against extremism			1
another school investigated , @entity75 , was already in special measures			0
allegations under investigation include claims that an @entity20 style video was copied at @entity82 and teachers punished children by making them kneel on the floor , the @entity77 reports			1

professional hearings are set to begin next month			0
more than 50 teachers alleged exchanged messages in a @entity29 group which included offensive comments about @entity32 soldiers and claimed the murder of soldier @entity34 in @entity104 , was a hoax in his report , @entity106 ( pictured ) found there had been a ' coordinated , deliberate and sustained action ' to introduce an aggressive @entity1 ethos in the schools the teaching watchdog has obtained ' dossiers ' about some of the 100 staff it is investigating from the @entity117 as part of its inquiries			1
they are understood to include information from last year 's @entity7 probe headed by @entity106 , the former head of counterterrorism at @entity125			0
his report , published in july , found there had been a ' co-ordinated , deliberate and sustained action , carried out by a number of associated individuals , to introduce an intolerant and aggressive @entity1 ethos into a few schools in @entity13 '			1
it also highlighted a ' disconcerting pattern ' in the schools , including nepotism in staff appointments , bullying of senior teachers , a ' strategy of harassment to oust the head teacher ' and the ' reinforcement of @entity64 identity to the exclusion or disparagement of others '			2
a source told the @entity77 : ' the 100 or so include teachers , teaching assistants and teaching staff			1
the @entity117 is feeding in information to help corroborate some of what the @entity47 has , and , in other cases , flag up new targets			0
' ' in some cases , some of those teachers and staff are still working at schools , and in other cases they have been removed			2
' but although some of them have been removed , the @entity47 does not want them to end up anywhere else			0
' the @entity7 scandal started with an anonymous letter in march last year describing an @entity1 plot to take over schools in @entity13 called ' @entity168 '			1
the document - now thought to be a hoax - proposed a campaign of installing governors and undermining and then replacing school leaders with staff who would be more sympathetic to their religious agenda			2
that in turn led to 21 schools being inspected by schools inspector @entity180 , which put six schools in special measures and said five had not done enough to protect children from extremism			2
@entity65 , @entity66 , @entity37 - all run by the @entity67 and @entity68 in @entity13 were placed in special measures			0
another school investigated , @entity75 , was already in special measures			0
then in november last year , inspectors found evidence that six independent faith schools in @entity193 , in east @entity191 , had an unbalanced curriculum			0
several teenage girls have fled to join @entity196 in @entity197 from schools in @entity193			0
this easter , tens of thousands of leaflets were distributed by @entity193 council advising parents to ' lock away ' their children 's passports if they fear the youngsters may be planning to travel to @entity197 over the holiday period			0
@entity193 is the only local authority in @entity191 where @entity64 account for the largest single religious group			0
