by @entity0 published : 13:03 est , 30 september 2013 updated : 07:05 est , 1 october 2013 two ' useless ' dogs who were abandoned by their owners are now saving some of @entity5 's most historic homes after being hired by the @entity6 to sniff out dry rot			1
@entity8 and @entity9 have been specially trained to alert surveyors to damage which is invisible to the human eye in stately homes			1
the so - called ' rot hounds ' have already saved conservationists hundreds of thousands of pounds by leading them to the early signs of dry rot at @entity6 properties			2
specialist : @entity9 goes to work sniffing out dry rot which even an experienced building surveyor such as @entity20 , above , may not be able to spot yellow labrador @entity8 and his black counterpart spent 12 months training for their new role after their previous owners gave them away			1
@entity8 's former owners were fed - up with him being too boisterous while @entity9 was retired as a shooting dog because he was afraid of guns			1
they now sniff their way around historic houses and are trained to sit down when they detect a whiff of the fungus			0
the labradors are the only two professional dry rot sniffers in @entity5 and happily carry out their work in return for chocolate rewards			1
@entity8 and @entity9 have been taken on by @entity20 and @entity41 , a @entity43 - based historic building restoration firm which specialises in the environmentally friendly control of dry rot and decay			1
managing director @entity47 said : ' the dogs enjoy their jobs			0
it is a game for them			0
star employees : @entity9 , left used to be a gun dog who was scared of guns and @entity8 was abandoned by his previous owners for being too boisterous ' they run in circles of decreasing size and hone into the area			1
' both dogs were given away by their owners to @entity65 animal rescue homes where they were then adopted by @entity20 and @entity66			0
@entity8 , seven , is based in @entity67 , @entity43 , and looks after properties in the south of @entity5			2
his latest assignment was finding dry rot in the 300 - year - old basement of @entity74 property , @entity75 , near @entity76			2
cheap labour : the labradors are the only two professional dry rot sniffers in @entity5 and happily carry out their work in return for chocolate rewards collections manager , @entity83 , said : ' @entity8 's sniffing skills allowed him to sweep spaces and locate rot within concealed timber and masonry			1
' @entity9 , eight , lives near @entity89 , @entity90 , with surveyor @entity91 , 60 , and hunts rot in the north			0
mr @entity91 said : ' a boisterous working dog is exactly what 's needed for sniffing out anything , whether it 's drugs , firearms or fungus			0
' you need a very focused , single - minded animal determined to find something that usually ca n't be seen			0
top job : the labradors showed their worth when they helped to survey the 17th @entity74 property , @entity75 , near @entity76 , above ' @entity8 lives for the joy of working , praise from me - and the occasional doughnut			0
' @entity111 , known as dry rot , flourishes where there is moisture , and leads to decay and deterioration of timber , but can be treated if caught early			2
@entity20 and @entity66 have previously had rot - dogs called into @entity119 , following the fire in 1992 .			0

@entity8 and @entity9 are the only two professional rot sniffer dogs in the @entity5
