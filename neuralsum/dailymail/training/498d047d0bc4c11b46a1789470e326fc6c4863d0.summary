when the @entity2 family was invited to a wedding at @entity4 in @entity5 , i was rather hopeful i might catch a glimpse of the celebrity - strewn nuptials of @entity8 and @entity9 who , at the time , were widely rumoured to be preparing to tie the knot on the shores of this most beautiful holiday destination			1
inexplicably , they decided to wed in @entity15 - so my wife @entity17 , daughter @entity16 and i were able to focus fully on the equally delightful , and paparazzi - free , marriage of our close friends @entity21 and @entity22			1
after landing at @entity23 , and an hour 's stomach - churning car journey around the endlessly winding roads that border the lake , we arrived at @entity27 , a small village on the west bank of the lake , some 17 miles north of @entity4 itself			1
an absolute beauty : @entity4 , with the little town of @entity34 adorning its shore , is a true @entity5 wonder the @entity27 occupies an enviable spot directly on the tree - lined promenade and opposite @entity34 , one of the most famous and picturesque towns on the lake			1
our room was large , clean and comfortable with two balconies offering the most incredible views of the lake and surrounding mountains			1
it was a real delight to gaze out across the shimmering waters to the steepsided , verdant hillsides and watch the ferries ply their trade			0
a few of the more affluent tourists clearly had money to burn , so came and went by seaplane			0
as befits a small , family - run hotel , the @entity57 staff were extremely friendly and efficient - small things such as printing out airline boarding passes , helping with translations and booking taxis and trains were all done with a smile			0
the y - shaped @entity4 is nearly 30 miles long and divides into two branches at @entity34			1
@entity68 sits on the south - western tip , @entity70 on the south - east			0
the crystal - clear waters plunge to 1,300ft in parts , making this one of the deepest lakes in @entity75			0
a different part of @entity5 entirely : @entity8 and @entity9 married in @entity15 in late september @entity4 is an incredibly popular resort and , though they could easily be something of a tourist - trap in peak season , i was mightily impressed by the shoreside restaurants and bars where staff were friendly and prices reasonable			1
using a phrase book and pidgin @entity5 , i managed to order up a veritable feast for dinner including fresh , crisp pizzas , large plates of delicious pasta , and wonderful bruschetta liberally dosed with garlic , basil and tomatoes			1
it was simple fare but very well done and staggeringly good value at just € 49 ( about £ 38 ) - and that included copious beer , wine and soft drinks			0
a boat trip around the lake took us past the luxurious villas of the rich and famous			1
@entity108 is rumoured to own one and , apparently , another villa appeared on @entity114 's ' judges ' houses ' section of the show			2
the truly magnificent @entity116 , built for cardinal @entity117 at the end of the 18th century , has starred in many films including @entity120 with @entity121			2
standing on the tip of a steep promontory overlooking the lake , the sweeping gardens and high walls give this fabulous mansion a real air of a @entity130 villain lair			2
making do with a non-celebrity wedding : the @entity2 family were denied a glimpse of the @entity134 sadly , the time for sightseeing was limited as we had to don our finery for the wedding			0
the ceremony and reception were held on the shore of the lake			2
bathed in sunshine , the backdrop of jagged peaks , passing boats , gleaming water and beautiful hillside villas provided a truly stunning location for such a memorable event			0
as the sun set over the lake , the wine flowed and the laughter and dancing became slightly more raucous			2
it may have been a celebrity - free wedding , but the @entity2 family were more than happy to have been invited and to experience the splendour and majesty of @entity4			1
@entity159 ( www.ba.com ) offers return flights from @entity161 to @entity162 from £ 110 and can arrange car hire			0
@entity27 ( www.albergolenno.com ) reopens on march 13			0
double rooms cost from € 80 ( £ 63 ) including breakfast .			0

rumours *abounded* that @entity8 might marry next to @entity4
*hollywood* star married @entity9 in @entity15 at the end of september
@entity4 is @entity5 's third largest lake , after @entity172 and @entity173
