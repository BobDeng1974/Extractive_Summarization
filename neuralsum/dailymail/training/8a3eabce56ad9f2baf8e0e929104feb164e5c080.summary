the triplets were produced when a single , fertilized egg split into three - a one - in - a - million chance especially considering the triplets were conceived naturally dr. @entity38 , director of @entity39 , says the odds of producing identical triplets without fertility drugs range from 1 - in - 1 - million to 1 - in - 100 - million			1
he said the rarity makes it difficult to more accurately calculate the frequency of such births			2
@entity9 weighed 3 pounds , 2 ounces ; @entity10 3 pounds , 11 ounces ; and @entity19 4 pounds			1
' it is not unusual with identical triplets to have a difference in weight , ' said dr @entity38			1
' they usually do n’t share equal amounts of the placenta so therefore one gets a little less nutrition than the other			0
when you have a difference in weight , the little one does better after they are born because the stress of being little matures your lungs faster			0

they 're extremely rare babies because they were conceived naturally without the help of fertility drugs room for more : @entity13 and @entity14 are the proud parents of naturally conceived triplets now which one is this ? hopefully the parents will be able to keep tabs on who is who			1
this baby girl has a birth mark on her forehead so that could be a help ! dr. @entity38 at @entity12 says this sort of birth is rare — so rare that he could n't give definite odds on it happening without fertility treatments			2
