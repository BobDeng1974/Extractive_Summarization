@entity0 are back in the title race @entity2 can become a @entity4 legend @entity5 deserves praise for building @entity8 's £ 200m @entity7 the main talking point after @entity11 's defeat at @entity8 on saturday was the performance of referee @entity13			1
it was n't great and @entity15 was quick to point that out			2
but i was more interested in an aspect of @entity11 's game that let them down badly – corners			1
@entity11 fans will already be aware that their manager @entity15 is not a big believer that set - pieces are a significant advantage – he said in an interview earlier this year : ' i do prefer open play goals , i 'm not going to hide it			1
a goal from open play is a more satisfying goal			1
' @entity11 surround @entity13 after the referee awarded @entity8 a controversial penalty on saturday @entity11 also felt aggrieved that @entity35 was not sent off for a high boot on midfielder @entity37 it 's an admirable policy , unless you 're trying to win at @entity8 when they are bang in form			1
i thought @entity11 played well and possibly deserved something from the game			2
@entity44 made one fantastic save from @entity45 but apart from that there were few chances created from open play by the visitors			1
their endeavour did , however , force seven corners			0
all of which were truly terrible			0
here 's the catalogue of corner cock - ups from @entity11 on saturday : 1st corner – 39 minutes : @entity58 took it from the left , it was easily headed away by @entity61 on the edge of the six - yard box with no @entity11 player challenging for the ball at all			1
2nd corner – 57 minutes : @entity67 took this one , again from the left , and it went high into the hands of @entity44 with no @entity11 player even close to the ball			2
3rd corner – 68 minutes : taken short by @entity67 , played back to him by @entity58 , the cross was lofted high into @entity44 's hands again			0
@entity58 and the rest of the @entity11 team struggled to utilise set - pieces during the defeat by @entity8 4th corner – 72 minutes : @entity58 took this from the right			1
it barely left the ground and was easily cleared by @entity85 before it had even reached the six - yard box			0
@entity58 was then taken off corners			0
5th corner – 81 minutes : @entity67 with an outswinger from the right			0
headed away easily by @entity61 under no pressure whatsoever on the edge of the six - yard box			0
6th corner – 91 minutes : @entity95 took this one , and again it was headed away on the edge of the six - yard box by @entity61			0
no @entity11 player jumped with him			2
7th corner – 95 minutes : @entity101 rushed to take this one with time running out			0
an outswinger from the right hand side			0
headed away again by @entity61 on the edge of the six - yard box			0
@entity11 boss @entity15 admits he prefers his teams to score goals from open play than set pieces a corner is an opportunity to put a ball into the box , a chance to create a goalscoring opportunity			1
the corner taker ca n't be tackled , obviously , so it is a chance to deliver a ball unchallenged and unhindered			0
and yet all seven of @entity11 's corners at @entity8 were dreadful			1
i would have thought a set - piece would be regarded as a great way to get something from a trip to the champions , but @entity15 obviously disagrees			1
even the two free - kicks @entity11 had close to the penalty area troubled the wall more than the goal – @entity67 taking both			1
@entity15 sees set - pieces as a negative			1
' the hardest thing in football is to break a team down when everyone is behind the ball			0
a free - kick or a dead - ball situation is less in your control			1
but you are relying on the bounce of the ball or people switching off or doing their duties , ' the @entity11 boss has said			2
i understand his point , but if you are clever from set - piece situations , if you work on them on the training ground , then they might also give you an advantage			0
as much as defenders can set themselves ready for a corner , they do n't know exactly what the opposition are planning with each delivery			0
@entity67 took two free - kicks against @entity8 but troubled the wall rather than goalkeeper @entity44 on saturday , @entity61 took up his position on the edge of the six - yard box and @entity11 gave him the ball from their corner			1
to not believe that corner offered a significant advantage is one thing , but to effectively not bother trying to make anything with them is n't clever			0
@entity15 though is adamant : ' you are a winning team when you do n't rely on set - pieces			2
' except @entity11 lost a game they should have got something from because their set - pieces were so bad			1
i love that @entity15 treasures possession and tries to play football the right way			2
but with all those corners on saturday , @entity11 gave the ball straight to @entity8 , which goes against his own philosophy surely ? the irony is that @entity15 's finest moment in football came when his @entity195 side won the @entity196 – against @entity8 – in 2013			1
the winning goal came when @entity198 headed home … from a @entity201 corner			0
i suspect @entity202 will be hoping @entity203 might see a few corners being taken this week			0
@entity198 climbs highest to head home the winning goal for @entity195 against @entity8 in the @entity208 final			2

@entity11 's corners and free - kicks let them down badly against @entity8
all seven of the @entity11 corners at the @entity216 were terrible
manager @entity15 admits he prefers to score from open play
@entity11 lost after @entity221 's challenge on @entity222 led to a penalty
