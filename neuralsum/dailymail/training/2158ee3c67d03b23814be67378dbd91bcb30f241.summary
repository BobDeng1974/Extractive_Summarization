by @entity0 last updated at 11:42 pm on 28th february 2012 playing games : @entity2 billed its @entity3 as a way to stay fit they are billed as the perfect way to exercise and have fun , all without having to leave the comfort of your own living room			1
but playing active video games wo n't help you stay fit , a study has found			1
researchers who tracked dozens of overweight children for three months found those who mimicked the movements of boxing , tennis and other sports using a @entity3 were no more active over all than those who played video games while sitting on the couch			1
the results of the study , published in @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , a major medical journal , will be a blow to @entity2 , which claims that playing with its latest gadget , the @entity28 , ' a little every day ' will help people become fitter and healthier			0
@entity2 is also an official partner of @entity31 , the government 's high profile anti-obesity drive			0
unlike traditional sit - down video games , the @entity3 is played by waving a wireless , motion - sensitive box through the air to control the movement of bats , racquets and boxing gloves			1
gamers can also dance , do yoga , practise their skiing and hone their hula hoop skills without ever stepping outside			0
a study suggests playing active video games wo n't help people to stay fit some previous studies have shown it to boost exercise levels			1
but these were done under tightly - controlled laboratory conditions and real world studies have produced conflicting results			0
so , @entity57 , of @entity58 in @entity59 , set out to resolve the issue			0
seventy eight overweight boys and girls were given @entity3 consoles and a supply of active or inactive games and fitted with a gadget that recorded how much they moved			2
the news will be a blow to @entity2 , which claims playing with its @entity28 will help people become fitter this revealed those who played the active games to not do any more exercise overall than those who played the more traditional inactive games			2
dr @entity76 said : ' we expected that playing the video games would in fact lead to a substantial increase in physical activity in the children			1
' frankly we were shocked by the complete lack of difference			1
' he said it was possible that the children put the minimum of effort into playing the active games			2
another possibility is that they compensated for their exertion by doing less exercise later on			0
dr @entity57 cautioned that his study was n't definitive but said that it ' indicates that there 's no public health benefit from having those active video games '			1
he added : ' these findings suggest that simply acquiring a new video games does not automatically lead to increased physical activity , thereby minimising the public health value of simply having active video games available for children to play			2
' other experts said that it was still possible that the children burned extra calories during their gaming sessions that the movement device did n't pick up on - for instance , if they were moving their arms a lot in a boxing game			0
over time , this could add up			0
but dr @entity57 said that such small amounts of movement would be of little benefit to health .			0

users of @entity3 no more active than those playing video games sat down
' frankly we were shocked by the complete lack of difference , ' say *scientists*
