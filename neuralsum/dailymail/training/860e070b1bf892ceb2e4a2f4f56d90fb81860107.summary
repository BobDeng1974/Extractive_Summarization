skier @entity0 has a lifelong reminder of his spectacular crash while speeding down the slopes in the @entity5 courtesy of a helmet - mounted camera			1
@entity0 was on his first run of the day at the @entity9 ski resort in @entity11 department of the @entity5 on january 25 after what he said was a big night of partying when he came a cropper			2
the competent skier cruised through the opening stages of the run before upping his speed and weaving in and out of his fellow holidaymakers on the piste , but then as the video shows he struck an unexpected bump			0
a day on the slopes started out well enough for skier @entity0 in @entity9 in the @entity5 @entity5 unfortunately , his night of partying soon caught up to him and he lost control in an attempt to cross the run @entity0 's skis pushed ahead of him and then off as he lost control while picking up speed on january 25 before he knew it both skis where gone and he was helpless as he was soon sliding down the piste @entity0 is left looking up at the pristine blue skies after the fall which saw him try and fail to cut across the run at the end of a safety barricade where a mound of snow had built up			1
in a split second his skis clipped off his boots and his momentum saw his slide a significant distance down the slope as snow flew up to obscure the otherwise picturesque view			2
when @entity0 finally came to a stop , he lay quietly on the ground for a few moments before regaining his composure and switching off the camera			1
as he skids down the hill , a large amount of snow obscures the vision from his helmet - fixed camera the skier remained calm as he slid down the slope on his back , without his skis before coming to a stop luckily he did not hit anything or suffer any severe injuries - he can be heard saying he 's okay after the crash @entity0 lay calmly on his back after coming to a stop and later wrote he would not recommend skiing downhill on a sunday morning after a drunken night out the evening before in fact , @entity0 , who is heard to confirm he 's ok , almost appeared relieved to be having a rest in the snow based on later comments online			1
' first downhill race on sunday morning after a drunken night , ' he wrote			0
' a good lesson for those who do not control their speed as i did			0
no severe injuries but a huge thrill ! '			0
