the ex-wife of an @entity2 oil magnate who was just awarded the second biggest divorce settlement ever in the @entity4 has slammed the court 's ruling saying that the $ 1billion payout she is set to receive is ' inappropriate ' and ' not fair			1
' @entity8 has appealed the ruling made last month in an @entity11 , @entity2 courtroom , citing 78 alleged errors and missteps that caused a judge to grossly undervalue her stake in one of @entity4 's greatest oil fortunes			1
the oil fortune she refers to is that of @entity21 , the company founded by her ex-husband @entity22 in 1967 , who himself is worth $ 9billion			1
the couple never signed a prenuptial agreement			0
mr. @entity22 will take their $ 750,000 home in @entity52 , @entity53 and a $ 300,000 log cabin that sits on 154 acres in @entity55 , @entity2			1
as for the appeal , miss @entity8 made it clear just days after the november 10 ruling that officially made her a billionaire that she believed the marital wealth she was entitled to had been grossly undervalued			1
the only spouse to ever score a bigger settlement in the @entity4 was @entity64 , who reportedly received $ 2.5billion after splitting with her businessman and art dealer husband @entity65 in 1999			1
relaxed living : the @entity38 home has been valued at $ 800,000 and was one of three the couple owned in @entity2 all good ? : miss @entity71 's appeal does not say anything about the property she was awarded in the divorce miss @entity71 stated that she felt that the decision by judge @entity76 to allow lawyers for both her husband and for @entity21 to be involved in the proceedings was ' inappropriate ' in that it allowed them to ' double team ' her			1
the crux of the argument though comes down to how much money the company and mr. @entity22 made beginning in 1988 , the year he and @entity83 were married			2
during the trial it was argued that @entity21 ’s growth stemmed mostly from passive factors , such as rising oil prices , and , under @entity2 law , only the ' active ' portion of wealth accrued during marriage in previously acquired assets is subject to division			2
miss @entity8 ’s lawyers contend however that @entity100 miscalculated what was due to her by attributing only a small portion of a $ 14billion rise in the value of mr. @entity22 's @entity21 shares during the marriage - 6 percent			1
' as @entity8 has stated previously , 6 percent is not a fair proportion of the wealth the couple accumulated during their marriage , and she trusts that a more equitable division of the marital estate will result from this appeal , ' her legal team said in a statement			2
the mansion : miss @entity71 also got the couple 's second @entity2 home located in @entity120 and worth $ 4.6million big growth : during the course of their marriage , mr. @entity22 's company 's worth jumped from $ 50million to $ 20billion miss @entity8 , who worked as a lawyer for @entity21 when she and mr. @entity22 married , and went on to take a series of executive roles at the company , also claims that @entity100 undervalued her own contributions to the couple ’s wealth			1
most estimates have stated that @entity21 was worth around $ 50million in 1988 when the couple married , which is just a drop in the well when compared to the $ 20billion behemoth it is today			0
a behemoth that mr. @entity22 has a 68 percent stake in , a stake he lost none of in the divorce as it was determined to be ' separate property			0
' all this , combined with lingering timeline questions presented by @entity83 that question whether strategic moves that ultimately yielded giant profits for the company happened before or after the couple 's 1988 wedding , will likely cause this case to drag on for as long as two more years			0
and there 's somehow more			0
that aforementioned $ 9billion fortune of mr. @entity22 's was in fact a $ 20billion fortune as recently as august , with the oil baron forced to watch over half his worth slip away due to a drop in the price of crude oil			2
started from the bottom : mr. @entity22 was born one of 13 children to a sharecropper working his way up : he pumped gas when he was 20 and slowly saved up his money to drill his first well filing for divorce in march 2013 , miss @entity8 alleged in court papers that her husband was having an affair , citing that as the reason for termination of the marriage			1
mr. @entity22 had over the course of their marriage grown to become one of the richest men in the world , a far cry from his youth and a true embodiment of the @entity4 dream			2
born one of 13 children to a sharecropper , mr. @entity22 worked his way up , picking cotton as a child , pumping gas and fixing cars by the time he was 20 and eventually saving up enough money to drill his first well			0
and while mr. @entity22 , who was previously married and has three children from that union , is no fan of the spotlight , he has not exactly shunned it over the past few years			0
in 2012 , mr. @entity22 became a big part of @entity199 's presidential campaign when he was appointed energy adviser , a gesture he thanked the politician for by donating $ 985,000 to the @entity203			0
mr. @entity22 also hosted a fundraiser at his $ 4.6 million @entity205 , @entity2 mansion for the @entity208 candidate , which raised more than $ 2million			2
it is worth noting that the @entity120 mansion is no longer mr. @entity22 's but , along with a $ 800,000 home in @entity38 , @entity2 , the property of @entity83			1
big score : in 2012 , mr. @entity22 was one of the select few named to the @entity215 , an event he attended with his wife friends in high places : 2012 was also the year mr. @entity22 became an adviser for the @entity199 campaign it was also in early 2012 that mr. @entity22 earned the biggest accolade of his life when he was named to the @entity215 for that year			0
he and his wife attended the ceremony together that april in @entity226 that also honored , among others , @entity229 , supreme court associate justice @entity230 , president @entity231 and @entity232			0
the two posed on the red carpet together , smiling for the cameras with their arms around one another , looking happy and excited			0
miss @entity8 would file for divorce less than a year later .			0

@entity8 has appealed the $ 1billion payout she received in her divorce from her ex-husband , oil giant @entity22
in her appeal , miss @entity8 points out 78 alleged errors , while also calling the presiding judge to task for letting her husband have two teams of lawyers
mr. @entity22 had *representation* during the 10 week trial to determine the *monetary* settlement , as did his company , @entity21
miss @entity8 also received a $ 14.7million @entity47 ranch and two @entity2 homes valued at $ 4.6million and $ 800,000
lawyers for @entity83 say that the amount of wealth accumulated during the marriage was miscalculated and should be far higher
the settlement is the second highest ever in the @entity4 , after the $ 2.5billion reportedly received by @entity64 in 1999
