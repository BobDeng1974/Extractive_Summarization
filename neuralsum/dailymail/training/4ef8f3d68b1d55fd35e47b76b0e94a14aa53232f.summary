@entity0 is rushing to resolve a spacesuit problem that put the life of an astronaut in danger in 2013 ahead of three important spacewalks			1
two astronauts onboard the @entity7 will venture outside the station in the suits in the coming days			1
but while the suits appear to be in working order , engineers are concerned about a recurring issue that led to the helmet flooding previously while an astronaut was in space			2
@entity16 space agency @entity0 is rushing to fix a spacesuit problem			1
it is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut			1
the issue is where the fan pump separator , party of the spacesuit 's temperature control system			1
if the pump failed , the astronauts would have to return to the @entity7 ( shown ) the issue is with a piece of equipment known as the fan pump separator , part of the spacesuit 's temperature control system			1
' that is the same area of concern we had back in 2013 when we had the issue of the water in the helmet , ' said @entity40 , @entity41 and integration manager			2
the trio of upcoming spacewalks will install new docking stations for commercial cargo at the orbiting laboratory			2
construction of the @entity7 began on 20 november 1998			2
it supports a crew of up to six , with crews split into groups of three			0
the station orbits at a height of about 255 miles ( 410km )			0
it has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds ( 450,000kg ) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five - bedroom house			0
it completes an orbit of @entity62 every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles ( 27,600km ) per hour			0
it has now been in space for more than 5,900 days , during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of @entity62 , and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years			0
@entity0 was alerted to the problem when astronauts were doing spacesuit maintenance in december and found that the fan pump in one suit did not speed up as expected			1
a new fan pump separator that was on board the space station was installed as a replacement ' and it has been working with no issues since that point , ' said mr @entity40			1
however , when @entity0 commander @entity77 was scrubbing cooling loops on another @entity16 spacesuit on january 20 , he heard an ' abnormally loud fan pump separator , ' according to @entity0 's blog of space station activities			1
' we were doing the same kind of activity and encountered the same type of failure , ' mr @entity40 told reporters			0
' that got us thinking : what has changed ? what is happening ? ' a new spacesuit was shipped to the outpost and will be worn by mr @entity77 during the spacewalks			2
the other spacesuit , with the replacement part , will be worn by fellow astronaut @entity97			0
its fan pump separator has shown some signs of corrosion , but it is working , @entity40 said			1
' the two suits we are going out with have operated every time we turned them on , ' he said			0
engineers believe that small amounts of water are building up in the bearings inside the fan pump separator each time the suit is powered up and powered down , leading to corrosion over time			1
the upcoming spacewalks will be performed by @entity0 astronauts @entity77 ( left ) and @entity97 ( right )			1
the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march , each beginning at around 12.10pm gmt ( 7.10am est ) and lasting about six hours the issue is related to the water - in - helmet leak that nearly drowned @entity119 astronaut @entity118 during a spacewalk in july 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water , mr @entity40 said			1
' with the water in the helmet , that was a totally different root cause issue			0
that was an issue with port holes getting clogged up in the water separator , that was due to the water chemistry , ' he explained			0
' that is not an issue here			0
what we are talking about is a failure of the pump to start up			0
that in itself is not a water - type of event			0
' if the pump were to fail , the astronauts would have to end their spacewalk and return to the hatch			2
' this is not a risk to the crew in terms of loss of life , ' said @entity40			0
the issue is related to the water - in - helmet leak that nearly drowned @entity119 astronaut @entity118 during a spacewalk in july 2013 - he rushed back into the space station and quickly recovered ( shown here in this image from the @entity7 ) - but is not expected to cause a similar gush of water a final decision about whether or not the spacewalks - known as extra-vehicular activities , or @entity163 - can begin friday as planned depends on the outcome of further tests , and should be announced later today			1
' all indicators are - based on all the data from the ground testing as well as the testing of the suits on orbit - is that we will work our way through this and these suits are going to be okay			0
but we have some open work left to do , ' said mr @entity40			0
the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march , each beginning at around 12.10pm gmt ( 7.10am est ) and lasting about six hours			1
the astronauts will be preparing cables and communications gear for new docking ports at the space station			1
the ports will be used by future astronaut crews launched from @entity186 , @entity187 once the first commercial capsules are ready to fly people beginning in 2017			2
@entity190 and @entity191 are in the process of completing their respective crew vehicles , which will restore the @entity16 ' ability to send astronauts to low - earth orbit after the retirement of the space shuttle program in 2011 .			2

it is related to a problem in 2013 that nearly drowned an astronaut
the issue is where the fan pump separator , party of the spacesuit 's temperature control system
if the pump failed , the astronauts would have to return to the @entity7
three important spacewalks are scheduled to take place soon
the spacewalks are scheduled for 20 february , 24 february and 1 march
they are needed to install equipment for docking ports that will allow manned *private* *spacecraft* to dock with the space station in 2017
