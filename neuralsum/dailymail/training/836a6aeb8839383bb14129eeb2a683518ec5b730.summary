by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 18:50 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 01:37 est , 21 may 2013 for 100 years , the @entity3 has been a showcase for what ’s hot in horticulture			1
this year ’s show is no exception – but you ’ll literally need to throw in the kitchen sink to keep up with the latest trend			1
not to mention a fridge , a woodburning oven and under seat heating … yes , outdoor kitchens are the latest must - have for green - fingered hosts who want to impress their guests with something more than a soggy sausage on the barbecue			1
or so say the experts			1
piping hot : celebrity chef @entity23 demonstrates his outdoor oven at the horticulture show yesterday ‘ there ’s an increasing trend for outdoor living and entertaining , for using the garden as a place where people and families gather , ’ said @entity28 , director of upmarket garden furniture firm @entity29 which had its new top of the range line on display at the show yesterday			1
‘ people are entertaining outside more and the @entity42 weather is no barrier – you just have to plan how to deal with it			2
’ it was an overcast day at the show in @entity47 yesterday as it celebrated its centenary with a host of vip guests but the alluring smell of garlic flatbread wafting from a £ 2,000 wood - burning stove – designed and demonstrated by @entity23 at mr @entity28 ’s stand – certainly set @entity56 ’s taste buds tingling			1
the supermodel ex-wife of sir @entity58 , dressed in a black leather biker ’s jacket , shades and leopard print shoes , made a beeline for the freshly cooked treat			2
outdoor life : a @entity29 stand showing a large oval table , sofa and ' @entity69 ' kitchen in the background behind her was a row of hand - made oak kitchen units housing a fridge by @entity74 , a plate warmer , and enamel sink by @entity77 of @entity78			1
worktops are available in granite or quartz			2
a common sight in meadows and hedgerows , cow parsley is often considered to be a nuisance weed in gardens			2
but the tall , rapidly growing plant with its white flowers is in favour with some designers at @entity3 this year			1
other plants in vogue include ragged robin , also often seen in roadside verges , and native wildflowers such as shepherd ’s purse and hop			2
rhododendrons are also increasingly back in fashion			2
other humble varieties that feature predominantly this year include foxgloves and daisies			0
the kitchens are made to order , with prices on application , but each individual unit including appliance is understood to cost around £ 3,000			1
a further £ 2,145 gets you the snazzy matching kitchen trolley complete with a slot for a champagne bucket			0
oak chairs , a table with parasol , loungers with a ‘ classic but contemporary ’ look completed the display – and there was even a grate housing electric heating elements placed in the floor under the table and seats to keep diners warm			0
press day was also an opportunity for the royals to turn up in force to lend their support to an unexpected garden designer – prince @entity133			0
the 28 - year - old helicopter pilot was at @entity3 for the first time with his charity @entity137 , which helps @entity139 orphans in impoverished @entity140			1
the prince has been closely involved in the creation of the charity ’s garden – even examining designs while stationed in @entity146			0
colourful pose : absolutely fabulous actress @entity147 was at the show promoting the cause of weeds prince @entity153 looked proud as punch at his son ’s efforts and when prince @entity157 arrived @entity133 said : ‘ you were meant to be looking at strimmers and tractors , @entity151 , i did n’t know you were coming			1
fantastic ! ’ ' you were meant to be looking at strimmers and tractors , @entity151 , i did n’t know you were coming			0
fantastic ! ' prince @entity133 the prince even teased @entity157 that a circular stone centrepiece to his garden span round with flashing lights was rather like a nightclub podium			0
‘ really ? ’ @entity157 enquired earnestly			0
‘ no , @entity151 , they would n’t let us , ’ @entity133 joked			0
last to arrive was the @entity170 who was delighted at her grandson ’s efforts but apparently told @entity133 to send a few plants to his father ’s stumpery at @entity176 as he ‘ needed a bit of greenery ’			0
royal seal : @entity170 ( left ) at @entity3 yesterday			1
prince @entity133 ( right ) welcomed his father @entity153 with a kiss the garden ’s creator , @entity182 , said she had been inspired by the landscape of @entity140 itself as well as @entity133 ’s experience of losing his mother @entity186			0
a pattern of hearts and crowns has been engraved on a circular terrace in the garden , acting as a memorial to the late princess			0
' i do n’t weed			0
i do n’t believe in weeding because weeds are only flowers ' @entity147 @entity147 was also at the show promoting the cause of weeds			1
‘ i do n’t weed , ’ she declared			0
‘ i do n’t believe in weeding because weeds are only flowers			2
’ of the ‘ lovely ’ garden at her @entity47 home , the absolutely fabulous actress , a self - confessed ‘ pagan and believer in the trees ’ , added : ‘ it ’s looking sensational at the moment , everything ’s out as we all know so we ’ve got all the blossoms and all the sweet smelling and all the lilacs tumbling over and the tall bits and the shadowy bits			1
