the brave man who stood up against a neo-nazi at an anti-islam rally has spoken out about the poignant moment that was captured on camera			1
during the @entity8 rallies on the @entity9 weekend , anti-racism protester @entity5 was snapped staring into the eyes of a bald man with a swastika tattooed behind his ear			1

anti-racism protester @entity5 , from @entity14 , had a face off with a neo-nazi at the @entity9 weekend 's @entity8 rallies mr @entity5 was raised in @entity14 and says he lived in a multicultural part of the @entity25 capital where he was exposed to racial tensions the anti-racism protester said he learned islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to ' unlearn ' these views ' ' a few scuffles broke out as a result of those trying to push and fight their way through the picket lines , ' he said			1
' i remember looking at the bald man from the photo and it seemed to me that he and his group were there solely to be violent and express incoherent hatred , which took away from the already limited opportunities to engage in civilised discussion			1
' i have however felt this kind of anger before , and this understanding produced in me a moment of unexpected compassion for him			0
' i placed myself in between him and the anti-racism protesters			2
my arms were outstretched to keep people back and when the man got in my face i was expecting him to attack me			1
' as he began to relax i told him there would be no more fighting today			2
i was n't expecting him to comply so easily , but i respect him for doing so			0
' mr @entity5 said he was born and had grown up in a multicultural part of @entity14 , where he had been on the giving and receiving ends of ' racial prejudice and bigoted views '			1
' i learned islamophobic views from a young age but thankfully managed to unlearn and re-learn enough to accept that many of my simplified views were irrational , ' he said			0
' i have learned that the vast majority of @entity70 @entity69 have come to @entity70 to improve their lives , contribute to our society and are against the extremist interpretations of their faith which they are so often accused of holding			2

' i firmly believe these divisions in our society are distracting us from the more immediate issues that should be of greater concern to all @entity70			0
