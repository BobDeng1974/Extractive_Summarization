a breathless @entity2 tie was over , the underdogs had taken the victory they deserved , and the @entity5 fans believed they knew precisely where the credit lay			1
' @entity8 ! ' they sang , time and time again			1
and as the new manager clapped his hands and took his bow , nobody could deny him the credit			0
in a few short weeks , @entity8 has created a formidable side from a formless rabble , and this latest success was the most dramatic evidence yet			1
the tie was decided on the balance of five goals in a gloriously bewildering first half			2
and it was decided in favour of the better equipped , more adventurous football team			0
so thrilling was the performance , so beguiling the possibilities that @entity8 spoke of amended ambitions			2
he looked at the mass cull of the giants , and he became thoughtful			0
' i want to stay in the @entity33 , so the @entity2 was n't high on my priority list ' , he said			0
' but when you get in the last 16 , things change '			0
such a performance can provoke those kind of dreams			0
for @entity5 were genuinely impressive , the sheer pace of @entity41 and @entity42 constantly disrupting a strangely fallible @entity44 defence and the guile of @entity46 delivering the kind of performance which @entity8 knew was within him			1

' they talk about our organisation being one of the strengths of this team			0
not today ' , he said			0
' you ca n't defend like that			0
it was very poor , very poor '			0
there was no attempt at excuse , for excuses would have been distinctly difficult to find			0
for a club which might , with justice , have had their sights set on @entity127 , it was a shattering disappointment			0
that remarkable first half gave us goals beyond reason , with two teams geared to attack , scoring virtually at will against defences which obliged them with space and time and all the mod cons which @entity33 teams rarely supply so generously			1
@entity5 in particular played with a zest and a freedom which had so recently seemed way beyond their means			2
but their confidence is tangible , and it was not dented when @entity44 opened the scoring in eight minutes with the simplest of goals			1
a left wing corner from @entity149 swirled through the defence and @entity73 was allowed the simplest of chances			2
@entity5 conducted a brief inquest , shrugged and set about settling the score			2
satisfaction arrived within three minutes , when @entity89 played in his ally @entity103			1
the shot was parried by @entity158 and @entity41 devoured the rebound			1
@entity41 's speed proved far beyond the resources of the @entity44 defence , and a ball played into the path of @entity165 almost brought @entity5 the lead they deserved			1
yet in 16 minutes , they were behind once more , as @entity66 crossed low and fierce to the near post and @entity82 's plunge diverted the ball into his own net			1
on such a day , and in such a mood , it was no more than a temporary hitch			0
and it was avenged inside four minutes when , from a long clearance , @entity89 picked out @entity103 , the home defence once again declined to do its job , and the striker accepted the simplest of driven goals			1
four in the first 20 minutes : the neutrals were delighted , the home fans disturbed			2
for a side which has spent its season scrapping for survival was tearing them apart with acute pace and intelligent movement			2
in 38 minutes , that side took the lead , as they had long threatened			1
it was @entity89 again , discovering the space , sensing the danger points and creating the chance from which @entity41 scored emphatically			2
they are not used to being treated in this fashion with the team @entity80 has created			0
@entity103 smiles at the @entity5 fans after @entity8 's side went 3 - 2 up against @entity44 in the @entity2 fourth round @entity73 watches on as his early header flies past @entity91 ( right ) and into the @entity5 net at @entity51 's the @entity44 team celebrate in front of their fans after @entity73 headed past @entity85 to put @entity44 ahead @entity72 ( left ) high - fives goalscorer @entity73 after he headed in from a @entity149 corner to fire the @entity44 into the lead at half time , @entity210 was removed from the fray as the nominated scapegoat – ' i was n't happy about his performance today ' , said @entity80			1
in truth , he could have removed any number of suspects in midfield and defence , such was their ineffectiveness			0
but the improvement their fans demanded was pitifully slow to arrive			0
@entity5 looked organised , their tactics uncomplicated			2
on the days when their assurance is instinctive and their passing flows , @entity44 can be as accomplished as almost any side in @entity228			1
but , as @entity80 said , this was not such a day			0
their approach was overly complicated , their chances were rare			0
and their luck was running perilously low ; having brought on @entity236 for @entity237 in 59 minutes , they lost @entity236 to suspected broken ribs after a clash with @entity88 13 minutes later			0
yet still they might have salvaged their cause in the 88th minute , when a corner was shuffled to @entity72 on the fringe of the area			0
he drive was struck with vicious intent , but @entity85 's flying save was a small miracle of agility			1
the chance was lost , and so was @entity44 's @entity2 tie			1
@entity61 ( right ) dives to his left but can not stop @entity41 's shot squirming underneath him to put @entity5 3 - 2 ahead in what was a cracking @entity2 tie at @entity51 's , @entity57 loanee @entity103 shoots past @entity61 to pull @entity5 level for the second time two loanees celebrate together as @entity57 's @entity103 ( left ) and @entity258 's @entity46 celebrate together at @entity51 's @entity56 ( left ) , arms spread wide , approaches his @entity5 team - mates to join in the celebrations after their third goal of the afternoon @entity88 ( left ) breaks past @entity72 down the right - wing as @entity5 looked for a goal in the fifth round of the @entity2 against @entity44 @entity266 ( left ) protests his innocence to referee @entity105 as @entity44 's @entity73 ( right ) looks on			1

@entity44 opened the scoring inside 10 minutes when @entity73 headed past @entity85
@entity5 were level two minutes later when @entity41 finished after @entity42 's shot was parried
@entity82 diverted into his own net in the 16th minute to restore @entity44 's one - goal lead
but again , @entity5 pulled it back level when @entity57 loanee @entity103 got on the *scoresheet* himself
six minutes before half - time , @entity8 's side took the lead for the first time when @entity41 fired home
