it was the highest ranking of the century and follows decades of decline under @entity15 , as rising taxes , stifling bureaucracy and ballooning debts damaged business and pushed @entity1 down to as low as 15th in the competitiveness league table			1
on the up : @entity1 was yesterday ranked the eighth best country in the world in which to do business - but continues to be held back by high taxes , red tape and debt ‘ the @entity1 continues to make up lost ground in the rankings this year , rising two more places and now settling firmly back in the top 10 , ’ said the @entity8 in its @entity25			1
the @entity30 welcomed the report as proof that government reforms , including cutting corporation tax and relaxing planning laws , were having an impact			0
but the @entity8 warned that @entity1 ’s economic situation remained grim and said the world faced ‘ a long period of economic uncertainty ’ as the debt crisis in the eurozone raged			1

the @entity8 , which scores each country according to 12 ‘ pillars of competitiveness ’ , said ‘ the most problematic factors for doing business ’ in @entity1 included ‘ access to finance ’ – a crisis highlighted by the @entity73 ’s make the @entity72 campaign			2
other problems were tax rates and regulations , government bureaucracy , an inadequately educated workforce , poor infrastructure , burdensome employment laws and a weak work ethic among staff			0
