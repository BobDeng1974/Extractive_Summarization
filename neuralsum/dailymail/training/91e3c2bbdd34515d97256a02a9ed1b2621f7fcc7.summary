news of the resistance helped garner support among the rebels , who defeated @entity81 's army at the @entity156 amid cries of ' remember the @entity30 ! ' the historic victory cemented the status of the newly formed @entity160			0
the legend was firmly established by the 1955 @entity57 tv show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty rifle as the hordes of @entity27 soldiers closed in for the kill			0

he added : ' i 'm just an enthusiastic amateur			0
what i know is out there to be learned , it 's just that i took the time to do it , because of the book and to find out what i was buying			1
' @entity186 @entity185 said @entity1 would pay to ship the artifacts to @entity19 with the understanding that the state would use public funding and private donations to eventually spruce up the @entity30 site — including erecting a building to house the collection			1
in the meantime , some items will be displayed as soon as october			0
the collection is worth millions but @entity1 said , ' being @entity199 , we do n't talk about that kind of thing			1

' he told the @entity204 : ' i 'm not extravagant in other ways , i live a very simple life			0

but on the other hand , i do n't buy extravagant items like cars , expensive houses , jewellery			1
i 've got no other expensive interests			0
my interests , for the last 25 years anyway , have been relics , buying things that are attached to something that i feel very interested about			0
even i have a limit … i was offered something once for a million dollars			0
' he said his love affair with the battle itself centred on the fact that ' people came here and made a stand here – for good or bad '			2
' that 's another political can of worms , ' he told the paper			2
' but for good or bad they came here knowing they were going to die , hoping they were n't but knowing they probably would , and that appealed to me even at six or seven , the idea of being that brave			0
' @entity1 mostly retired from music in 2011 but first came to the @entity30 in 1973 , while on his first @entity79 tour with @entity11			2
he , singer @entity243 and the tour manager had three days off and each got to pick a destination			0
