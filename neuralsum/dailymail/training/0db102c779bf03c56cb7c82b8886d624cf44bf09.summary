by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:26 est , 25 july 2012 updated : 19:08 est , 25 july 2012 the 30th @entity2 officially opened this afternoon and there was a perfect start for @entity5 as the women 's football team beat @entity7 1 - 0			1
but organsiers were forced to make a grovelling apology to the @entity11 team who refused to start @entity14 match against @entity15 when the @entity17 flag was displayed by mistake			0
in the @entity22 match a free - kick from @entity20 after 65 minutes split the sides at the @entity24 in @entity25 , though the ground was only half - full for @entity28 's historic debut in the competition			1
@entity28 players and coach @entity31 celebrate at the final whistle after the team beat @entity7 1 - 0 @entity20 ( far right ) curls home the winning goal as @entity5 beat @entity7 1 - 0 at the @entity24 talking about the mix - up with the @entity11 flag organisers said : ' today ahead of the women 's football match at @entity39 , the @entity17 flag was shown on a big screen video package instead of the @entity11 flag			1
' clearly that is a mistake			0
we will apologize to the team and the @entity45 and steps will be taken to ensure this does not happen again			0
' the match against @entity15 was delayed more than an hour and was scheduled to start shortly			0
gaffe : the @entity50 is shown next to a @entity11 player before the match against @entity15 which had to be delayed after the @entity11 refused to play shock : horrified @entity11 supporters watch on after the flag of their bitter rivals @entity17 is displayed by mistake @entity57 : the @entity11 team did eventually take to the field after the right flag was displayed despite all the organisers ' claims that the @entity63 would sell - out , @entity5 kicked off the @entity64 in front of swathes of empty seats			1
but those in attendance saw a winning start , as @entity20 's perfect 25 - yard free - kick proved the difference in a tightly - fought match			1
officially , an estimated 40,000 tickets had been sold - which would be a record for a women 's football international in @entity28 - but there were huge swathes of empty seats when the match began as fans drifted into the stadium			1
there were plenty of seats to choose from as @entity28 and @entity7 emerged into the @entity24 to get the @entity84 underway fans get ready for the start of the @entity63 at the @entity24 in @entity25 , but there were plenty of empty seats at the @entity28 versus @entity7 women 's football match those that did arrive early would n't have been too inspired by a goalless first - half , but @entity28 gained the upper hand after half - time			1
as of yesterday , 36,200 tickets had been sold in advance - barely enough to fill two tiers of the 74,000 - capacity stadium - with a few thousand expected to pick up £ 20 seats on the gate to watch @entity31 's team			2
the unfilled seats would have come as a disappointment for @entity2 organiser @entity103 , who was in @entity25 to officially declare the @entity63 open			1
he said : ' we are ready , the nation is ready - let the @entity2 begin			2
lord @entity103 was in @entity25 to officially declare the @entity63 open before the first women 's football match of the @entity2 between @entity28 and @entity7 ' it has been a long journey but i ’m convinced these games will lift the nation and bring the country together			1
' we ’ve proved the doubters wrong by getting everything ready on time and we ’re looking forward to making these @entity63 a huge success			2
' when i arrived in @entity25 i felt i had arrived in an @entity63 city - this is the start of the @entity2 in a fantastic setting			1
' we have n’t left any stone unturned in giving the athletes the platform on which to perform			0
' @entity24 general manager @entity124 stressed the historic nature of the occasion as a @entity5 women 's football team played in the @entity63 for the first time			1
he said : ' there was some criticism that ticket sales were slow			0
' but a normal women ’s football game would attract about 6,000 - 8,000 and we are close to 40,000			2
' clearly there is an interest in the football and the @entity63			2
people who are not normally football fans want to be able to say that they were there			0
' the @entity28 team play @entity7 this afternoon in the first event of the 2012 @entity2 meanwhile , 41,000 will be at @entity39 in @entity141 this evening for a women 's football double - header of the @entity143 v @entity144 and @entity11 v @entity145			1
while this will fill most of the 52,000 - seater @entity149 national stadium , only 6,500 of the tickets have actually been sold			2
the remainder have been given away to charities , youth groups and sports clubs			0
organisers said overall 80,000 free tickets had been distributed for @entity39 's eight @entity63 matches			1
two other games will be played today at the @entity158 , which holds 32,500			0
the @entity24 had been cleaned and freshly painted for the occasion , the familiar red of the @entity161 national rugby and football teams replaced by purple @entity63 paraphernalia			1
the finishing touches are applied to @entity63 branding at the @entity24 in @entity25 ahead of @entity5 's women 's football opener with @entity7 @entity25 likes to shout about its sporting pedigree , and rightly so			1
@entity5 boast a record number of @entity161 athletes — 30 ( which beats the 27 who appeared in 1908 ) — including two captains : @entity175 midfielder @entity174 and 400 metres hurdles world champion @entity176			0
a giant set of @entity63 rings , measuring 18m x 8m ( 59ft x 26ft ) , has been outside the @entity179 since late april			2
huge crowds cheered the @entity63 torch when it visited @entity25 in may			2
@entity5 striker @entity182 on the ball in a training session in @entity25 ahead of the @entity63 opener against @entity7 about £ 160,000 of taxpayers ’ money has been spent on ‘ cleansing and animating ’ the city centre , which is prettily dressed in bunting to mark the 11 football matches it will hold over the next 16 days			1
but this has n't translated into ticket sales			0
tickets will be available on the gate today , starting at £ 20 with under 16s paying their age			0
the ease of catching a train from @entity200 also means the city has seen only a modest rise in hotel bookings			0
a recent poll by @entity25 - based newspaper @entity205 saw 52 per cent of 1,006 respondents agree with the statement : ‘ i do n’t think @entity161 will see any benefits from the @entity84			0
’ it was @entity211 that was rehearsed at the stadium yesterday , in preparation for the arrival of a @entity22 team that does not include a single @entity161 player			0
but the @entity22 team are looking forward to their chance to take centre - stage in a home @entity2			2
their match will be broadcast live on @entity222 from 3.30pm this afternoon			0
those in attendance at the @entity24 will witness history , because this is the first time a @entity22 women 's football team has participated in the @entity63			1
' it is fantastic to be opening the @entity2 and that we are n't competing with any other sport , ' said @entity5 captain @entity230			2
' this is as big as the @entity232			0
if opening the games with the first - ever @entity5 side is pressure , let 's make it a good one			0
' we are desperate to do well and make sure we leave a lasting legacy for women 's football			1
' @entity5 face a tricky group with @entity242 and @entity243 , one of the favourites for gold , to play after @entity7 .			0

free - kick from @entity20 gives gb 1 - 0 *victory* over @entity7
lord @entity103 declares the @entity2 officially open before match
but there 's lots of empty seats at the @entity24 as the first @entity63 event gets underway
40,000 - strong crowd still a record for a women 's football international
*30,000* tickets given away free for *tonight* 's matches at @entity39
