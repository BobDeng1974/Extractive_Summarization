a @entity1 man is now claiming @entity3 's proudest creation : @entity4			1
entrepreneur @entity5 will soon begin creating whisky - more than 500 miles from one of the homelands of whisky - @entity9 entrepreneur @entity5 , 51 , plans to produce ultra-premium , small batch single malt whisky from his plant in the @entity12			1
by 2017 , visitors to the area could be enjoying a glass of @entity16 - for the price of £ 44.95 per bottle			1
by then , mr @entity5 aims to have his first run of 5,000 ' single estate ' bottles ready			1
yet three years before the launch , he is already taking orders of the whisky			0
mr @entity5 is renovating two @entity12 stone buildings at @entity26 , near @entity27 , in @entity28 to equip as the distillery , tasting rooms and offices			1
he has also imported a @entity32 to help him with the job - master distiller @entity34 and a wood and ageing consultant , @entity37 , has also been brought on board			1
as well as whisky , the distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries			2
by september this year , mr @entity5 hopes to begin producing his first bottles and in the summer of 2015 gin from the distillery will go on sale			1
the distillery will also create a rye whisky called @entity51 's @entity50 after a local landmark associated with the @entity53			0
mr @entity5 said : ' we are excited to be creating an adventurous new landmark for the region and for @entity58 whisky			1
' the idea was born out of a passion for single malt			0
' i was very much charmed by the @entity3 and their production			2
' i really did n't want to sit behind a desk any more so i thought to myself ' what else can i do ? ' ' i just happened to be looking out of the window at our @entity12 house and i saw a beautiful field full of barley and thought i could distil that , ' he said			1
and all of the ingredients used in the distillery will be from the @entity12			0
the businessman bought his first cast of the spirit in 2002 , at the newly reopened @entity80 on @entity81			0
over time , @entity5 , who is originally from @entity82 , watched a number of whisky distilleries open , and grow from strength to strength , inspiring him to start his own operation			2
the label on the bottles will read : ' established 2013 , single malt whisky '			0
each bottle will be decorated with a pheasant a new home for whisky : the @entity12			0
mr @entity5 is pictured here in front of the stone buildings in @entity26 , @entity99			1
soon , bottles of @entity12 single malt will begin being released from behind these doors he plans to use locally sourced ingredients in his production , and has already pre-purchased 20 tonnes of barely from a nearby farm			0
@entity12 water will also feature as one of the main ingredients , and bottles of both single - malt and gin will be finished off with speciality water bought in from @entity112 , @entity113			1
but although @entity3 is the country behind whisky , mr @entity5 said he does not find its reputation for the drink intimidating , instead , he plans to follow the @entity3 lead			1
mr @entity5 aims to have his first 5,000 bottles of @entity119 ready by 2017 the distillery will also make dry gin and a range of brandies and liqueurs made from local fruits and berries from the @entity99 site , he hopes to produce around 120,000 bottles of whisky a year			1
he said : ' i never forget for a day what good quality drinks are being made just a couple of hundred miles north of us			0
' what we put out in a year will be what the medium @entity3 firms put out in a day or two			1
' we are looking to build a reputation regionally , to us @entity3 is not intimidating , it is a road to follow			1
' i see a lot of people who want to go off and do their own thing , but i 'm in this to make a product , i need to be able to sell my second bottle as well as my first			0
' the @entity5 family is funding the project alongside the @entity147 - which is offering interested investors an opportunity to take part			2
@entity3 version of the spirit is spelled without an ' e ' the @entity154 version takes an ' e ' the spirit is distilled and made with cereals , yeast and water comes from the @entity161 ' uisge beatha ' , or ' usquebaugh ' , meaning ' water of life ' since 2007 , legally , @entity4 must be produced in @entity3 @entity163 can only be used for a @entity163 distilled at a single distillery from 2012 , by law , bottles labelled @entity167 can only be produced in @entity3 @entity4 does not mature , no matter how long it is kept for			1
for example , a 10 - year - old whisky does not become a 50 - year - old whisky if kept for 50 years different grains can be used for the spirit : @entity173 , rye , corn , maize the process : first the whisky is malted , which means sugar is extracted from barley and turned into alcohol using yeast			2
next , the malt is ground and hot water is added the product is distilled - which means that the liquid is heated to the correct temperature			0
with whisky the process usually happens twice liquid is then stored and matured in oak casks the whisky is then blended and bottled hundreds of miles away in @entity196 , another unlikely entrepreneur has had a bright idea : to create the first bottle of @entity3 wine			2
in september , in @entity201 , some 40 miles from @entity202 , weather dependant , @entity3 's first grapes will be harvested			2
meanwhile in @entity196 : @entity204 will soon be selling bottles of @entity206 from grapes grown some 30 miles from @entity202 by summer 2015 , @entity204 , the man behind the @entity3 wine , will be enjoying a bottle of @entity206 - created off the @entity209			1
@entity206 will be a medium dry white wine - with a similar taste to @entity212 or @entity213			0
the project of bringing wine to @entity3 began with a throwaway comment when a friend of mr @entity204 's said that if climate change continued , @entity196 would be the same temperature as the @entity220 within 20 years			2
thanks to another friend who supported the project financially , mr @entity204 was able to bring 100 vines from @entity225 in @entity226 to @entity3			2
he is growing three grape varieties : @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232 - all of which originate from @entity233			0
the grapes were chosen because they can all be harvested in september before temperatures drop			0
the plot is a six acre site , with a south - facing slope overlooking the @entity239 , where , mr @entity204 says the sunshine is ' fantastic '			0
last july the average temperature in @entity196 was 21.4 degrees			0
this morning however , the temperature is just 7 degrees and the humidity is 76 per cent			0
but according to mr @entity204 the plot 's location is key to the wine 's success - there are no hills blocking the sun and drainage to get rid of the rain			0
mr @entity204 has high hopes for the @entity1 wine industry			0
if the wine is a success , he hopes to attract an investor who will help finance planting 5,000 vineyards and produce 15,000 bottles of wine a year .			1

@entity5 will distil @entity16 in @entity26 , @entity99
has imported a master distiller from @entity3 and a wood consultant to help
was looking at the barley in his garden and thought ' i could distill that '
*spring* water from @entity113 will be used to add a local touch
hopes to produce 120,000 bottles a year with £ 44.95 pricetag
' to us @entity3 is not intimidating , it is a road to follow , ' he says
