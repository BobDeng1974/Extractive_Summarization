privacy campaigners condemned @entity1 yesterday for allowing businesses to buy access to its archive of millions of tweets			1
about seven million people in @entity7 use the social networking website to post short messages to ‘ followers ’			2
most believe their tweets are unavailable to those outside their chosen network after a week because that is when they can no longer be searched for on the site			2
more than 1,000 companies have joined a waiting list to use the data , compiled from around 250 million tweets a day but @entity1 has archived every tweet – there are about 250million a day – and has agreed a deal allowing the @entity7 - based company @entity24 to trawl through all those posted since january 2010			1
the company will use the information to help firms with marketing campaigns and target influential users			1
the licensing deal is part of @entity1 ’s plan to generate revenue from its service , which is free to its estimated 300million users worldwide			1
but the move has alarmed privacy campaigners , with the online rights group the @entity39 describing it as ‘ creepy ’			1
@entity40 , director of the @entity41 campaign group , said : ‘ people may consider tweets to be personal property but this deal makes clear they are not			0
our personal posts on social media are yet another way for advertisements to be better targeted and that ’s a very lucrative industry			0
‘ it ’s clear that if you ’re not paying for a service , you are not the customer – you ’re the product			0
’ @entity24 charges companies up to £ 10,000 a month to analyse tweets posted each day for anything said about their products and services			1
it claims to have a waiting list of up to 1,000 clients wanting to riffle through the huge @entity1 archive for data that could help them target advertising and develop marketing campaigns			0
private accounts and tweets that have been deleted will not be indexed by @entity24			1
@entity71 , of the watchdog group @entity72 , said : ‘ people have used @entity1 to communicate with friends and networks in the belief that their tweets will quickly disappear into the ether			0
‘ the fact that two years ’ worth of tweets can now be mined for information and the resulting “ insights ” sold to businesses is a radical shift in the wrong direction			1
‘ @entity1 has turned a social network that was meant to promote global conversation into a vast market - research enterprise with unwilling , unpaid participants			2
’ @entity90 , of the data privacy company @entity92 , said : ' marketers will stop at nothing to get hold of your data			2
this move shows all those throwaway tweets have suddenly become a rich new revenue stream for @entity1			0
' it has taken a stream of consciousness , analysed it , bottled it and sold it for a profit			2
and the worst thing is , you never knew it was going to happen			0
' datasift searches through 250 million tweets a day			0
it is one of two companies so far offered access to @entity1 's ' firehose ' - all the information that flows through the site @entity116 from security firm @entity115 said , ' the news will surprise some			1
@entity1 has found another way to monetise its service , having partnered with a firm which will make it simple for market researchers working for big companies to search and analyse the last two years of your @entity1 updates			1
' you thought that tweets you posted months ago had vanished , or were simply hidden away so deeply and awkwardly on the @entity1 website that they would be too difficult to uncover ? think again			0
' but @entity24 ’s @entity129 said : ‘ it should come as no surprise to users that their tweets are archived – they can see every update they have ever sent on their timeline			1
‘ @entity1 was always created to be a public social network			0
’ the row comes amid privacy concerns on other social networks			2
@entity143 has been criticised after admitting it can read the text messages of those who use the service on their mobile phones			0
and the web giant @entity149 has also come under fire for collecting data about internet users			2
@entity24 is one of two companies granted access to @entity1 's ' firehose ' - the full amount of data streaming through the site			1
' @entity160 goes beyond what many social media monitoring companies do , ' says founder @entity163			0
' instead of just searching on keywords such as ' @entity166 ' , @entity164 can search on all the people , products , and links associated with the company , then slice and dice the data for different departments such as marketing , product and the like			0

firm called @entity24 has bought access to two years ' worth of @entity178
users ' history - including *gps* information - will be sold on to advertisers
@entity185 storm over privacy and security
