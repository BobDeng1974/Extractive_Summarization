the @entity7 flight was due to fly from @entity8 to @entity9 in @entity10 , at 9.50pm on friday - and passengers were fed chips and beans to keep them going during the delays			1
passengers spent friday night in hotels in @entity8 and then returned to the airport to wait for the flight again on saturday - but were later told it was being delayed until 3pm yesterday			1
waiting game : the @entity7 flight was due to fly from @entity8 to @entity9 in @entity10 , at 9.50pm on friday - but passengers were fed chips and beans to keep them going during the delays airline officials then offered to put up the irate passengers in a hotel some 80 miles away in @entity26 , @entity27 , because they said there were no rooms available in @entity8			1
most refused the offer and slept overnight in the airport , which is located south of @entity32 , only to find the plane again missed its take - off slot			2
the flight finally took off late last night			1
but that meant delays for the passengers who were booked to go on that plane - who were told they would be delayed for 24 hours			1
some travellers said that the delays had left families in tears			1
@entity46 , 38 , was originally due to catch a flight on tuesday evening but it was cancelled			1
so when he turned up to catch the plane on friday night , he was furious to find he was grounded again			1
he said : ‘ i ’m a maths teacher and the term is about to start in @entity10			0
i thought i ’d be getting back in good time but as it is i ’ll be lucky to get there by monday			0
stressful : passengers spent friday night in hotels in @entity8 and then returned to the airport to wait for the flight again on saturday - but were later told it was being delayed until 3pm yesterday ‘ people are shouting and in tears			1
the airline just are n’t communicating with us - over the whole time they have given us about 40 minutes			2
the food is chips and beans			1

the food is chips and beans ' @entity46 , passenger a passenger named @entity74 told @entity75 on saturday night : ‘ it has to be seen to be believed			1
' there 's 300 people here			0
children , diabetics , @entity81 speaking people that ca n't even understand the tannoys			0
i 'm seeing people making expensive phone calls to @entity10			0
' i 'm seeing people that can not keep their fasts			0
i see people that have no access to food when it comes to opening their fasts			0
it is a shambles and an embarrassment to @entity98 society			0
' to keep saying we will inform you in two hours , and in two hours they say : “ we will inform you in two hours ”			0
i 've chosen to eat virtually nothing because i did n't want to have chips and beans again			1
' carrier : @entity9 - based @entity7 is @entity10 's second biggest airline			1
a file photo of one of its planes is seen ordeal : most passengers slept overnight in the airport ( file picture ) , which is located south of @entity32 , only to find the plane again missed its take - off slot			1

children , diabetics , @entity81 speaking people that ca n't even understand the tannoys			0
it is a shambles and an embarrassment to @entity98 society ' @entity74 , passenger a @entity8 spokesman said : ‘ they are working on the problem with the current aircraft			2
the passengers who were supposed to be on the 10pm flight on sunday have been informed at home			2
’ ‘ the staff on the ground are doing their best to help sort out accommodation and food but the majority of the communication has to come from the airline			0
we are doing what we can			0
‘ understandably passengers are frustrated and we can only apologise for the delay			2
’ @entity9 - based @entity7 is @entity10 ’s second biggest airline			1
nobody was available to be contacted last night , although a spokesman previously said passengers were offered ‘ every compensation ’			1
standing around : delays at @entity155 's @entity154 three months ago under new @entity158 rules , airlines must pay compensation for cancelled or heavily delayed flights , unless there are ' extraordinary circumstances '			2
this can include sudden severe weather events , such as a hurricane or something like the volcanic ash cloud episode of 2010			0
the ruling that outlines these rights is regulation ( @entity170 ) 261/2004 , which became law earlier this year			0
compensation is around £ 210 for @entity174 flights of 930 miles or less , £ 330 for flights between 930 and 1,860 miles and £ 500 for other journeys			0
it applies to any flight leaving an @entity158 airport and any flight into the @entity158 on an @entity158 - based airline			2
passengers can claim by telling the airline their flight number , names and reason for the delay			2
if rejected , they can take their case to court			0
in essence , if your flight is delayed by more than three hours , cancelled or overbooked , you may be able to claim .			2
