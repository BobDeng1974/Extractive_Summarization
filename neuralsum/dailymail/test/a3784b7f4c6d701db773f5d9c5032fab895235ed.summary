in 2005 , @entity44 came through qualifying and went on to lift the title			0
tantalisingly @entity44 could be next in line for @entity7 , a slender , shy man with a short ginger crop and a contagious giggle he often breaks into around the table			2

a steady opening session on thursday had seen he and @entity7 reach 4 - 4 , but the @entity75 stretched 10 - 6 clear by lunch on friday after firing breaks of 56 , 125 and 54 , and there was no flinching from the outsider when play resumed in the evening			2
they shared the opening two frames , before 87 from @entity7 took him 12 - 7 clear , inflicting a mortal blow to @entity0 's prospects			2
@entity7 sets his sights on the white has he plays his way to victory against @entity0 at the @entity3 when @entity0 edged the next he at least had the thinking time the subsequent interval allowed , knowing he needed a further five frames without reply to extend his defence			1
he re-emerged with a break of 101 to make it 12 - 9 and keep @entity7 waiting			1
after a safety battle , @entity7 potted a terrific red to the middle pocket and was away on a victory charge , firing in a brilliant 82 before @entity0 offered a warm handshake			2
