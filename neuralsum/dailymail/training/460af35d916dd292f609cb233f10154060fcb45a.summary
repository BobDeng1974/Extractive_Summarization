a @entity1 congressman shocked his @entity3 audience on sept. 12 by saying that as many as 40 @entity4 have returned to the @entity4 after fighting for the @entity6 terror army overseas , and that the @entity7 has them all under surveillance			1
@entity10 rep. @entity9 made the remarks during a breakfast speech to @entity13 , a regional economic development organization			0
' one of the concerns is the number of @entity4 citizens who have left our country to go join up with @entity6 , ' he said			1
' it is believed there have been some number up to 100 that have done that			0
' ' it is also believed that some 40 of those who left this country to join up with @entity6 have now returned to our country			1
those 40 are under @entity7 attention and surveillance			0
so they are known and they are being tracked by the @entity7			0
the @entity39 said two weeks ago that only about a dozen @entity4 had left the country to join up with @entity6 , while as many as 100 are suspected of taking up arms with a wider range of @entity57 extremist groups in the @entity58 and @entity59			1
although @entity9 cited a larger number of confirmed @entity4 citizens who have come back into the @entity4 after fighting for @entity6 , he insisted that they do n't pose a serious threat			1
' at the present time , ' he said , ' the intelligence is @entity6 does not present a threat to the homeland , although that is not something that will remain static going out into the future			2
' ' but there is a concern , ' he allowed , ' that it could metastasize in such a way that it could become a threat to the homeland			0
' @entity9 backed president @entity79 's approach to defeating the terrorist would - be country , which he said ' is a very , very complex and very , very dangerous threat			2
' referring to remarks @entity79 delivered on sept , 10 , he said , ' i think the plan that the president outlined the other night [ in his national speech ] is a good plan			0
' the president ' is correct to recognize the threat , and it clearly is a threat to the stability of the @entity58 , a region that is already remarkably unstable			0
' the @entity90 first reported on @entity9 's remarks			0
up to 12,000 so - called ' foreign fighters ' from 50 countries have joined with various @entity95 militant groups , including those who fight alongside @entity6 in @entity96 and @entity97 , according to the @entity98			1
@entity6 itself can now muster 31,000 troops , the @entity99 reported on sept. 17			1
that number has grown dramatically since june 29 , when @entity6 declared itself a ' caliphate , ' or an @entity46 nation led by a supreme religious authority			2
on thursday , @entity106 thwarted legislation that would have revoked the citizenship of @entity4 who swear allegiance to terror groups that threaten the @entity4 foreign fighters : as many as 12,000 soldiers in the 31,000 - man @entity6 terror army have traveled into @entity97 or @entity96 to join the @entity57 group in battle fbi director @entity116 said he would welcome a legal tool to keep @entity6 fighters from returning to the @entity4 by stripping them of citizenship , but fears it would be hard to argue cases in court without publicly describing classified intelligence @entity10 sen. @entity123 of @entity124 put a halt to @entity128 @entity127 sen. @entity127 's attempt to fast - track the bill , objecting that her party needed more time to consider its legal implications			1
@entity116 , the director of the @entity7 , told a @entity133 hearing thursday that he would be open to seeing such a law passed			2
but he expressed concerns that it could be impractical to enforce in court since much of the evidence would likely be classified			0
' how would i protect sources and methods ? ' he asked			0
' how would we be able to use , if at all , classified information to make the showing that would be necessary [ in court ] ? ' rep. @entity146 , a @entity147 @entity127 , told secretary of state @entity149 in a separate hearing that @entity50 should do more to restrict the travel of @entity6 fighters who hold @entity4 passports			1
' i think we need a way to approach this to make certain that their ability to come into the @entity4 is made a hell of a lot more difficult than it is right now , ' @entity146 said .			2

@entity3 rep. told a business group on sept. 12 that the would - be terrorists ' are known and are being tracked '
as many as 100 @entity4 are feared to have gone overseas to join @entity6 and its *murderous* jihad
@entity50 is split on whether to pass a law revoking the citizenship **–** and passports **–** of those *people* so they ca n't come back into the @entity4
feds fear the impact of *veteran* terror *warriors* moving *freely* throughout the country
