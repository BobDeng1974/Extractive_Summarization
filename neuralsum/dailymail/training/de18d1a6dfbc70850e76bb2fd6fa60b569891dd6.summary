by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 03:13 est , 17 september 2013 a 23 - year - old nurse who bumped into a man who allegedly tried to rape and kill her on a @entity5 train was overcome with fury and launched into a rage repeatedly slapping the man			1
the handcuffed man was held back by two policemen while the woman yelled at him and hit him , naturally being filled with rage at seeing her alleged attacker			1
the confrontation , which was captured on the police station 's @entity15 , comes just days after four @entity18 men were sentenced to death for the brutal bus gang rape of @entity21 who eventually died of her injuries			1
seizing the rare opportunity of having the upper hand , this nurse struggled to hold back these feelings , as she repeatedly hit her alleged attacker			1
according to @entity42 , the nurse had been travelling on an early morning train in @entity5 on july 27 when a ' drunk man ' boarded her carriage			1
the 27 - year - old man tried to force himself on her			0
she alleges he tried to rape her ; he has also been charged with attempted murder , the news service said			0
outraged : the woman had gone to the police to report the alleged attack which happened on an early local train in @entity5 as she travelled to work police said she accused the man of boarding the train drunk and then trying to rape her the woman raised the alarm and the man was arrested when he got off at the next station the nurse raised the alarm on the train and when her attacker got off at the next station , the man was arrested by the local railway police			1
the woman went to the police station herself to report the crime and while she was there officers brought in her alleged attacker			2
they had just completed a medical examination on the man			0
clearly extremely upset , and then outraged when she saw the man , the nurse confronted him			2
police said she wanted to talk to him and give him a piece of her mind , but the exchange became more heated			0
the news service says while no one should take the law into their own hands , the police understood her state of mind at the time , and she was still outraged at the alleged attack			0
there were at least three police officers in the room , watching , at times more people come and go			0
the news service points out that despite her lasing out , the woman ' bravely ' continued to lodge her complaint			0
in @entity18 , many women have been too afraid to report such crimes , for fear of being shunned in public and due to police corruption in parts			2
brought to justice : @entity101 ( left ) , 28 , and @entity102 ( right ) , 19 , are among four men handed the death penalty in @entity18 for the gang rape and murder of a young woman on a bus in @entity109 guilty : @entity110 ( left ) , 20 , and @entity111 , 26 , have also been ordered to the gallows over the attack @entity42 also noted that every train in @entity5 should have a police constable on it patrolling the carriages , but on this occasion there was none , because he had apparently missed the train			1
a ' dereliction of duty ' charge has now been registered against that constable			0
on average , a case of rape in @entity18 is reported every 21 minutes , but it was only after the horrific fatal gang rape and torture of @entity21 last december received global media attention , that the government has has stepped up its reaction to the crime			1
the victim , who was raped for an hour and tortured with an iron rod on a moving bus , became a symbol of the dangers women face in a country			0
noose : an @entity18 woman protestor demands the death penalty outside the court yesterday after violent protests in several cities the government , initially caught off guard , introduced tougher rape laws in march , and for the first time opened conversation about gender crime in television debates , social media and even @entity154			2
still , sex crimes remain commonplace in @entity18 , and social commentators say patriarchal attitudes towards women have not been diluted by more than a decade of rapid economic growth .			2

nurse , 23 , could *n't* contain her rage when confronted with alleged attacker
she claimed the drunk man tried to rape and kill her on an early @entity5 train
her *outburst* comes *shortly* after four men were sentenced to death in @entity18 for the fatal gang rape and torture of a *student* on a @entity109 bus last december
