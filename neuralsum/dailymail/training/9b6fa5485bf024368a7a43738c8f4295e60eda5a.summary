by @entity0 published : 11:08 est , 4 november 2012 updated : 13:33 est , 4 november 2012 @entity2 marathon organizers have blamed the media for the negative publicity that led to the race being cancelled in the wake of @entity7			1
a letter from the @entity9 was sent to 47,000 runners on saturday and said that ' the extensive and growing media coverage antagonistic to the marathon and its participants ' had made holding the 26.2 - mile race unsafe			1
a last - minute decision was made on friday afternoon to cancel the marathon after it was decided it would be divisive to hold the event through the five boroughs			1

he told @entity60 : ' those living a few blocks away from my family have been affected and it was n't until i came out to @entity38 on thursday that i realized how bad it was			0
' i realized that running for four - and - a - half hours was not the best thing when i could be helping and so i decided not to run			1
' a lot of people came from out of town for the marathon and i understand it 's a once - in - a - lifetime experience , so if they want to run the loop without taking away resources , then fine			1
' but if you 're from the city , you can run anytime and should be out helping your fellow @entity2			1
' priorities : would - be marathon runners in their distinctive orange tops in @entity57 , @entity38 which was one of the hardest hit areas here to help : many marathon runners turned out to help @entity2 who were hardest hit by clearing debris and bringing supplies called off : the marathon was cancelled due to public backlash that resources would be diverted from helping hurricane victims cancelled : two runners , who traveled to @entity2 to take part in the marathon , give a thumbs - down in front of the finish line in @entity26 on saturday after the decision to cancel the race there was concern from sponsors about a public backlash against the race , according to the @entity101 , which began in 1970 with just 127 runners			1
there was disappointment among runners who had spent months preparing for the grueling race which brings in millions of dollars for charities through fundraising			0
some ‘ disenfranchised ’ marathoners vowed to run the route anyway			2
@entity111 , who has lived most of his life in @entity38 , organized an unofficial shadow marathon			1
after some consideration , the group decided to do the original 1970 course route of roughly four laps around @entity26			0
@entity111 ’s project was met with some criticism from people who felt the marathon was insulting to people who ’s homes have been destroyed or lost loved ones			2
‘ instead of running past neighborhoods where people ’s homes once stood in a display of defiance , how about you volunteer and make your trip to @entity2 worth something bigger than your pride , ’ @entity126 wrote on the @entity129 group ’s wall			1
there was anger from some runners with people taking photographs beneath the @entity145 banners in @entity26 making rude gestures and giving it the thumbs down			0
wild west : people walk through the heavily damaged @entity149 neighborhood in @entity150 where a large section of the iconic boardwalk was washed away in the race : runners disappointed with the cancellation of the @entity145 decided to run it anyway - with many donating money to help victims of superstorm @entity7 outrage : workers prepare to remove generators , used by the @entity9 , outside of @entity26 near the finish line on saturday runners insisted the mock - marathon will be a display of @entity2 ’s resilience			1
‘ if it were a baseball game , no one would challenge the idea of letting the show go on , ’ @entity167 wrote on the page			0
‘ this is n’t about ego ; this is a reminder that humans are strong and brilliant , and we will not go gentle into that good night			0
' however the majority of participants agreed with the decision to cancel the race			2
hundreds of people were making their way to devastated communities up and down the @entity185 to volunteer			2
runners carrying backpacks filled with things like baby wipes and energy bars went to those in need in @entity38			0
many runners wore the vests they would have had on had they taken part in the race			0
' we initially were bummed , but also saddened by the perception that runners were indifferent to the needs of other people , ' @entity197 , a sports medicine doctor in @entity2 , told the @entity203			2
' we wanted to turn a negative to a positive			0
' aid : a boy watches as members of the @entity209 unload food and supplies in the @entity149 section of @entity150 stranded residents have been relying on volunteers delivering food , water , warm clothes and other basic necessities			0
almost one week after the superstorm struck the @entity185 , power was still out to some 2.5 million customers , the @entity218 @entity220 's @entity219 reported			0
the state with the largest number of outages by far is still @entity227 with 32 per cent of customers without power			0
@entity230 was restored to much of lower @entity231 early on friday evening but nine per cent of customers across the state of @entity2 still do not have power , followed by seven per cent in @entity235 .			2
