by @entity0 published : 04:34 est , 7 january 2014 updated : 14:50 est , 7 january 2014 @entity3 authorities are investigating whether the safety release on @entity6 's ski bindings failed causing the horrific crash that has left the @entity9 star fighting for his life			1
@entity6 , 45 , has shown ' slight improvement ' according to medics treating him in hospital in @entity14 , @entity3 , but remains in a critical but stable condition			1
the seven times world champion driver has been in an induced coma since suffering critical injuries after hitting his head on a rock while skiing with his son in the @entity22 last sunday week			0
mechanical failure ? investigators are probing the theory that the bindings attaching @entity28 's boots to his skis may have failed causing him to crash and hit his head on a rock investigators are now probing the theory that the safety release mechanism on @entity6 's bindings , which attach the skis to the boots , may have failed			1
the bindings are designed with a mechanism that automatically releases the boots from the skis in the event of a crash in order to prevent a skier 's legs being twisted by the skis as they tumble down a slope			2
critical : if @entity6 's bindings failed it could have meant his skis were release unnecessarily causing him to crash if the safety release failed it could have meant @entity6 's skis were released uneccesarily , causing him to lose control and hit a rock			1
prosecutors are also focusing on @entity6 's speed when he fell on a small off - piste section between two relatively gentle ski runs			1
earlier this week @entity6 ’s agent @entity57 denied reports her client had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 37mph			0
she said : ' i think after having spoken with several people who have been with @entity6 at this moment , @entity6 and the group have been skiing on slopes that were normal slopes			0
' then there is a blue slope and a red slope , and in between there was a part which was deep snow , and @entity6 went into that			0
' they are also investigating whether the limits of the ski runs next to the accident site were correctly marked			2
there have been concerns that the rock was lying close enough to the piste to require some kind of protection or signage			0
scene : the @entity9 ace crashed , hitting his head on a rock on this small off - pise section between the ' @entity87 ' and ' @entity89 ' ski runs in the @entity3 resort of @entity91 last friday former f1 driver @entity92 suggested that @entity6 was out of danger , but this has been denied by his family and management team			1
but in a statement on saturday morning , ms @entity57 said : ‘ @entity6 ’s condition remains critical but stable			1
’ it comes as @entity3 judicial authorities prepare to release their initial findings into the horror accident , which took place close to the upmarket resort of @entity91			0
@entity105 , the @entity106 prosecutor , said his team were trying to obtain smartphone footage shot by another skier			0
a flight attendant from @entity111 was filming his girlfriend on the slopes when he happened to catch what he believes was @entity6 ’s fall in the background			0
dangers : seven time @entity9 champion @entity6 was more concerned about possible mishaps off the track than dangers on the circuit , he told an interview in 2010 concern : @entity6 's wife , @entity125 , arrives at the @entity14 hospital where her husband is being treated after sustaining a head injury during a ski accident in @entity3 @entity22 vigil : @entity6 's father @entity131 , left , and brother @entity132 arrive at @entity133 , @entity134 , on sunday where the former seven - time @entity9 champion is being treated after sustaining a head injury the 35 - year - old witness has claimed he is ready to hand the footage over to the authorities , @entity138 reported			1
an official spokesman for the @entity14 hospital said last night : ‘ we will not be providing condition details for privacy reasons			2
’ yesterday it emerged that @entity6 made a will to distribute his £ 750 million cash , cars and property empire among his wife and two children just three years before the ski accident which has brought him to the brink of death			2
prosecution : @entity3 prosecutors may be preparing to charge the operators of the ski area in @entity91 where @entity6 was seriously injured , pictured , after hitting his head on a rock back in 2010 he admitted that he had made a will for the first time , telling a @entity166 magazine : ' yes , i have made my testament because i am a family man			1
@entity6 was travelling at 12mph when he crashed , a witness claimed ' but it is less about @entity9 but because of the things that can happen in everyday life			1
' on sunday his father @entity173 and brother @entity132 were among the close family visitors at his bedside in @entity14 's @entity177			0
@entity166 media reported that a brain scan on friday troubled his medical team but he had a quiet weekend			0
speculation is mounting that @entity3 prosecutors may be preparing charges against the operators of the piste where the accident happened			1
a press conference will be held on wednesday at 10am ( gmt ) in the @entity22 town of @entity106 , local prosecutor @entity105 said			0
attorney @entity188 - a specialist in the field of ski and criminal law and formerly chief judge of the @entity193 until 2010 - has been retained by the piste management			0
if any charges are laid they could pave the way for a multi-million pound lawsuit from the @entity6 family			2
the main question , according to @entity166 media , is whether the scene of the accident - full of rocks of the type that @entity6 collided with - was properly marked			1
the new focus of the investigation comes as more evidence emerges to suggest speed was not a primary factor in the accident			0
@entity6 was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow .			2

ski bindings may have released unnecessarily causing @entity6 to crash
@entity9 ace still in critical but stable condition in hospital in @entity14
prosecutors investigating his speed and if the piste was properly marked
speculation mounts if piste operators might face charges over the crash
witness claims to have caught @entity6 accident on film
