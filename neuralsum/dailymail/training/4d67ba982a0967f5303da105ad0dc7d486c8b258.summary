@entity1 ethics investigator @entity0 has lost his appeal against the findings which cleared @entity4 and @entity5 to host the 2022 and 2018 @entity6			1
@entity0 last month claimed a statement by ethics judge @entity8 on his report into bidding for the @entity6 had contained ' numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions ' and announced he would appeal			1
that appeal has now been declared inadmissible by @entity1 's appeals committee , who said @entity8 's statement was not a legally - binding decision and therefore could not be appealed against			1
ethics investigator @entity0 's appeal has been dismissed by @entity1 @entity8 's statement said any rule breaches by the bidding countries were ' of very limited scope ' , adding : ' in particular , the effects of these occurrences on the bidding process as a whole were far from reaching any threshold that would require returning to the bidding process , let alone reopening it			1
' a @entity1 statement said : ' the @entity1 appeal committee , chaired by @entity33 , has concluded that the appeal lodged by the chairman of the investigatory chamber , @entity0 , against the statement of the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of the independent ethics committee , @entity8 - @entity8 , is not admissible			1
@entity0 and @entity40 pictured together earlier this year ' the said statement about the report on the inquiry into the 2018/2022 @entity45 bidding process does not constitute a decision and as such is neither legally binding nor appealable			1
' meanwhile , complaints by two @entity45 bid whistleblowers that their cover had been blown by @entity8 's findings have also been rejected			2
@entity51 , who worked for the @entity4 bid team before losing her job in 2010 , and @entity54 , who worked for @entity56 's 2022 bid , complained that promises of confidentiality had been breached because his findings contained more than enough information to make them easily identifiable			1
@entity51 said in a statement : ' the conclusion of the @entity64 dismissing my complaint against @entity67 for breaching my confidentiality is a transparent avoidance of a clear violation of its own rules			0
' i cooperated with mr. @entity0 ’s investigation for over two and a half years under a clear , unqualified promise of confidentiality			2
he asked me for my confidentiality and repeatedly promised me mine			0
the @entity64 ’s avoidance of this undisputable violation is emblematic of its culture of self - protection			0
' the @entity64 ’s assertion that i had “ gone public with [ my ] own media activities long before the publication ” of @entity67 ’s statement is an obvious dodge			0
my public statements were all made long before i entered into a confidentiality agreement with mr. @entity0			2
' i made no public statements during the entire period of mr. @entity0 ’s investigation			0
i relied on @entity1 ’s promise of confidentiality and continued to honor my promise until @entity67 published his “ summary			0
” my recent public statements have only been made after @entity67 ’s identification of me in blatant violation of @entity1 confidentiality rules			0
' the @entity64 ’s decision today is one more example of an organization whose rules are mere formalities meaning nothing			0

@entity0 claimed last month his intention to appeal against findings which cleared @entity4 and @entity5 to host 2022 and 2018 @entity6
@entity1 has declared the appeal inadmissible and dismissed @entity0 's claims
