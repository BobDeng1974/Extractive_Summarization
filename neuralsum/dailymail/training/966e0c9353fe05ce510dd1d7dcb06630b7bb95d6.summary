by @entity0 the biggest culture shock to have impressed itself upon @entity2 during his first season in @entity5 football has been that no side ever gives up			1
a Â£ 42million signing from @entity9 in september , the @entity8 playmaker has found life in the @entity11 tough going thus far			1
@entity2 is expected to flourish in his second year since the switch			1
but the @entity14 claims he is still getting used to the intensity of competition , which is in stark contrast what that he witnessed in @entity20			1
shock to the system ! @entity2 ca n't believe how much harder smaller teams fight in @entity5 than in @entity20 bit of a struggle : @entity2 has found life in the @entity11 tough going during his debut season over here ' we had many matches			1
always forward and backwards , ' he said			0
' even against the smaller clubs even if it was 3 - 0			2
in @entity20 , the opponents stopped fighting when it was 2 - 0			0
' @entity38 's side go into saturday 's @entity40 final against @entity41 as overwhelming favourites , but @entity2 's words serve as a warning if they are to end a nine - year trophy drought			1
the @entity46 have been solid since their promotion to the top flight this year and comfortably avoided relegation			0
and recent memories of the penalty shoot - out semi-final win against @entity53 outfit @entity52 should act as motivation to get the job done quickly			0
' it will be a tough game , ' @entity2 added			2
' @entity41 fight until the end			0
nowhere else than in @entity5 are there so many teams who never give up			2
' touch anxious ? @entity38 's side are overwhelming favourites to win the @entity40 final against @entity41			0
