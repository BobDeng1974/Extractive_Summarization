hundreds of thousands of patients are still too afraid to speak out about poor @entity3 care , experts warned yesterday			1
they estimate that a quarter of a million incidents a year are never reported because patients and relatives think it will only make matters worse			1
many are scared that it will have repercussions for their subsequent treatment while others fear the whole ordeal will just cause more ‘ pain and grief '			0
today a report commissioned by the government is expected to warn that @entity3 staff who dare criticise standards of care are routinely being suspended or bullied out of their jobs			1
but dr @entity40 , chief executive of @entity41 , warned that the majority of patients who experience complain because they have no faith anything will be done			0
she also warned that more than half of patients who do raise grievances never get an apology from the staff responsible for the mistake			2
giving evidence to mps , dr @entity40 , whose organisation champions ’ patients ’ rights , said : ‘ our research shows that only 40 per cent of people who have concern or complaint actually raise that concern or complaint to a member of the health service			2
‘ we estimate we lose quarter of a million complaints every year which is equates to a complaint one every two minutes because trust and confidence is so low			2
‘ people fear for repercussions on their care , particularly where it is very personal such as in gp services or a care setting			0
’ dr @entity40 , pictured , said around 60 per cent of patients who suffered poor care refused to complain dr @entity40 , an academic in social policy who formerly advised the government , also said that bereaved relatives were being made to wait three years for apologies over the deaths of their loved ones			1
she said that only this week she had been speaking to a woman whose mother had died from a broken hip sustained during a a fall at a care home			0
dr @entity40 said the woman described the ordeal of trying to find out exactly what had happened ‘ like a three year slog ’ she added that staff were so defensive the woman felt like she was saying something ‘ dirty or wrong			0
’ the figures are based on research by @entity41 over the last two years including two polls covering 3,00 members of the public and detailed surveys of 400 patients			0
they consistently showed that around 60 per cent of patients who suffered poor care did not complain			1
around 170,000 patients do bother to complain about the @entity3 every year so based on the assumption that two thirds do not report poor care , around 250 incidences are unreported			1
health secretary @entity111 promised to transform the @entity3 ’s handling of complaints in october 2013 following a damning review by mp @entity115 , whose husband had died following poor care			1
but this evidence suggests very little has changed over the last year			0
@entity118 , chief executive of the @entity119 , said making a complaint very often added to victims ’ pain and grief			0
health secretary @entity111 , pictured , has promised to change the way the @entity3 handles complaints also giving evidence to mps on the @entity129 , she added : ‘ patients and relatives tell us that complaints system bureaucratic complex confusing and v often adds to pain and grief already suffering ‘ patients tell us its very time consuming and difficult to speak to person they need			1
‘ when people complain it takes very , very long time to get an outcome ‘ we certainly hear from patients who contact our national helpline about their fear of complaining in case their ongoing care will be compromised			2
‘ these are very often people who have been bereaved , who have been traumatised , and that whole episode has just compounded the grief for them			0
