there have been some scary times for @entity2 so far this season , with injury crisis after crisis , and only three league wins in their first nine games			2
and the @entity8 were in for a different kind of fright on friday , with several first - teamers getting dressed up for @entity12 in a new video for the club 's official channel			2
second - choice goalkeeper @entity16 , who is currently out injured and unlikely to play until the new year , stars in the clip as a vampire			1
@entity2 's reserve goalkeeper @entity16 makes a strangely convincing @entity20 @entity21 sees the funny side of things while dressing himself in a skeleton costume @entity21 shows off his full costume as the @entity2 team got in the @entity12 spirit on friday @entity29 full back @entity21 and @entity31 midfielder @entity30 also feature prominently , as a skeleton and zombie			1
and @entity34 , who has been filling in at centre back in the absence of @entity37 also got involved , dressed in black robes and looking as scared as when facing a pacey forward			0
@entity40 will hope that his players get over their fears on @entity12 , and are back focused in time for @entity43 on saturday afternoon			0
