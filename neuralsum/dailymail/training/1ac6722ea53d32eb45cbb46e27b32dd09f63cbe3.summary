by @entity0 @entity1 have told @entity2 they will have to pay £ 20million if they want midfielder @entity3			0
the 25 - year - old @entity4 made just 25 appearances for @entity1 in an injury hit campaign last season but he has attracted interest from @entity12 's side			1
the former @entity14 and @entity15 boss sees @entity3 as the perfect midfield addition to help @entity2 build on their third place finish in @entity18 last season			0
wanted : but @entity3 's price tag of £ 20million could price @entity2 out of any deal while new @entity1 coach @entity22 is not keen on letting the @entity4 leave , the club would listen to bids starting at the £ 20million mark			1
@entity2 president @entity26 seems unlikely to offer that kind of money though which could see @entity3 extend his four - year stay at @entity30			2
he has two years left on a five - year deal with @entity1			2
class : @entity3 gets to the ball ahead of @entity34 when @entity1 played @entity35 this season			0

@entity4 midfielder comes with a heavy price tag despite injury *problems*
@entity22 is willing to let the 25 - year - old go for the right *fee*
