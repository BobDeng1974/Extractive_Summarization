by @entity0 for the @entity1 switching from expensive supermarkets to cheap discount chains such as @entity4 and @entity5 has triggered the first annual drop in the amount of money spent in supermarket since records began 25 years ago			1
the @entity11 said people are spending £ 36million a week less in supermarkets than they did last year			1
it said @entity16 ’s supermarket price war had helped to cause the fall as they desperately battle to lure shoppers through their doors , rather than those of their rivals			1
a rise in the use of cheap discount stores such as @entity4 instead of expensive supermarkets has triggered the first drop in the amount of money spent in supermarkets since records began 25 years ago in july , the amount of money spent in supermarkets and other food shops fell by 1.3 per cent , compared to the same month last year			1
it is the first time since the @entity11 ’s records began in january 1989 that the amount of money spent by @entity16 in supermarkets has ever fallen on a year - on - year basis			1
in its monthly report , it stated : ‘ the fall in the amount spent in july suggests that prolonged discounting and price wars were having an effect on overall sales			1
’ supermarket giants , such as @entity49 , @entity50 and the co-op , have revealed price - cutting moves in recent months in a bid to lure back shoppers who have switched to cheaper discount stores			1
for example , @entity50 has promised to cut off a total of £ 1billion from more than 1,200 items over the next three years			0
a packet of @entity60 has dropped from £ 1.09 to 49p and a 250g pack of the supermarket ’s own - brand butter has fallen from £ 1.49 to £ 1 , it said yesterday			2
@entity64 , a director of the research group @entity65 , said : ‘ food retailers escaped the worst of the recession , in stark contrast to the non-food retailers , but are now feeling the heat as the economy recovers			0
‘ the years of austerity have left their footprint on shopping habits with the popularity of discounters growing			0
‘ the price war among the @entity80 is really damaging them all and making it into a race to the bottom			1
’ the @entity85 , the business lobby group , said the figures highlight ‘ the strong competition among retailers			0
’ a report published by the @entity90 on wednesday said it had also noticed the ‘ intense competition among retailers , especially in food ’			0
the @entity90 this week reported increased competition among retailers , ' especially in food ' it also said there is ‘ an increasing polarisation ’ among food shoppers towards either the ‘ premium ’ end or the ‘ value ’ end , with many shoppers using a mix of both			2
for example , they might buy all their meat in an expensive supermarket which sells good quality meat , but buy everything else form tinned tomatoes to bags of apples in a discount shop			2
cheaper trips to the supermarket represent a huge relief for families at a time when workers have faced six years of pay freezes or paltry pay rises			0
some have even been hit by pay cuts			0
the average pay rise in the private sector is just two per cent , above the current rate of inflation of 1.6 per cent according to a report published today [ fri ] by the pay research firm @entity130			0
but some workers are still being hit by a pay freeze , with seven per cent of pay deals resulting in a pay freeze			0
