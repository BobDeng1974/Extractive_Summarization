@entity0 was once described as @entity2 's right - hand man in @entity3 and even the judges in the @entity5 admit he is regarded as a ' very dangerous ' man the @entity8 government is to secure fresh assurances from @entity10 in an attempt to finally kick hate cleric @entity12 out of the country			1
deputy prime minister @entity14 today revealed ministers will work ‘ flat out ’ to deport the radical preacher after the government lost its latest court challenge to have him removed			2
appeal court judges yesterday rejected a plea from the @entity8 government to eject @entity0 , despite accepting that he is ‘ very dangerous ’			1
speaking on his weekly radio phone - in mr @entity14 said : ‘ no one wants this guy to stay here			0
' but his comments appeared at odds with justice secretary @entity29 who last night blamed @entity31 refusal to change human rights laws for the failure to give the terror suspect the boot			1
mr @entity29 said : ‘ @entity39 and the @entity31 ’ refusal to contemplate big changes to human rights law is inexplicable given problems like this			1
' i am bitterly unhappy that we have to wait until the next general election to sort this out			0
’ the @entity5 ruled that while @entity0 ’s deportation was ‘ long overdue ’ , his risk to the public was not ‘ a relevant consideration ’ under human rights laws			1
the judges yesterday upheld an earlier verdict that sending the hate preacher to face a terror trial in @entity10 would not be fair			2
home secretary @entity56 will now lodge a last - ditch appeal to the @entity58			1
if that fails , it would raise the prospect of @entity0 – variously described as a ‘ truly dangerous individual ’ and @entity2 ’s right - hand man in @entity3 – never being deported			1
he could apply to be freed within days			0
ministers have been trying for a decade to send @entity0 to @entity10 , where he is accused of plotting a terrorist atrocity to coincide with the millennium			1
today mr @entity14 said : ' this has been going on for years and years , it ’s incredibly frustrating , i ’m as frustrated as anybody this guy should n’t be here , he should be deported			0
‘ i wish we could have deported him years ago never mind over the last few months , ’ he told @entity75			0
judges in @entity87 said he would not get a fair trial because some of the evidence used against him may have been obtained by torture			0
controversially , mrs may opted not to appeal against this verdict			0
instead , she and her ministers secured personal promises from the @entity10 authorities there would be no use of torture evidence , and began the deportation process again in the @entity8 legal system			1
but last november , the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) said it was not satisfied with the assurances , and halted @entity0 ’s removal			2
the court said it must reflect the @entity87 ruling			0
that decision was yesterday unanimously upheld by @entity108 , the @entity109 , and two other @entity111 judges			0
mr @entity14 said mrs may would step up attempts to reach a deal with @entity10 that reassures the courts that @entity0 will get a fair trial			1
he said : ‘ it ’s been this endless legal ping pong , the @entity85 interestingly enough actually found against @entity12 and said that his appeal against deportation was wrong			0
‘ but the courts both here and elsewhere have said that there ’s this legal issue about whether the assurances that the @entity10 have given us about how their court system works is kind of sufficiently strong and that ’s where the legal argument has got stuck			2
‘ @entity56 has been out to @entity10 , she ’s going to work flat out to make sure that we strengthen those assurances from the @entity10 , we are absolutely determined as a government to deport this guy , i wish we could do it earlier			2
we have to jump through these endless legal hoops but we will get there			0
