brain dead : @entity0 was declared brain dead on december 12 after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea it is exactly a year since 13 - year - old @entity0 fell brain dead following a minor operation and doctors signed her death certificate			1
but she remains hooked to a ventilator			0
in a case that has ignited debate over the definition of brain death , @entity0 's parents remain adamant that as long as her heart is beating , she is alive			1
to prove that point , the family from @entity18 , @entity19 , released videos in october of the girl which showed her foot and hand appearing to move in response to her mother 's commands			2
however , numerous medics have dismissed the apparent development as involuntary muscle reflex often seen in brain - dead patients - the so - called @entity35 effect			0
@entity36 , a @entity37 pediatric neurologist , told a @entity19 judge in october that he sees no evidence that @entity0 is alive 10 months after a coroner signed her death certificate			1
@entity0 was declared brain dead on december 12 , 2013 , after she went into cardiac arrest following surgery to treat sleep apnea			1
@entity36 dismissed videos showing the girl moving her hands and feet at her mother 's command			0
her family wants @entity53 judge @entity52 to issue what would be an unprecedented order to reverse the death certificate , declaring her to be alive after being declared brain dead			1
the family 's lawyer @entity59 told the judge he wanted time for the court - appointed doctor and his own medical experts to confer			2
no new court date has been scheduled			0
' there was n't time to react to this letter , ' @entity59 said			0
' given the fact that we were up against the time crunch ... i thought that we were going to be in essence sandbagged			0
' @entity59 objected to @entity36 's appointment as an independent expert , arguing that the doctor has a conflict of interest because he was one of the physicians who agreed with the brain - death diagnosis last december			2
five other medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in @entity90 in september said the girl showed signs of brain function			0
in his letter to the judge , @entity36 replied that the tests either were irrelevant to determining brain death in a child or not carried out in accordance with accepted medical standards			1
' none of the declarations provide evidence that @entity0 is not brain dead , ' he wrote			1
@entity0 has been kept on a ventilator and feeding tubes since she suffered severe complications from the surgery			2
@entity36 examined her then at the request of the judge while her family fought a hospital 's decision to remove the equipment			2
@entity36 was one of three doctors who declared her brain - dead after finding no neurological activity			1
@entity59 has given the judge the results of a september 1 electroencephalogram that a researcher at a medical school in @entity134 said showed electrical activity in @entity0 's brain			2
@entity36 , in his letter to the judge , said the new test was performed in an apartment , not a health care setting , and the recorded activity could have come from elsewhere in the girl 's body or even the environment			0
tests : five medical professionals who performed new tests on the teenager in @entity90 last month said the girl showed signs of brain function regardless , he said , a flat reading on the exam is not a prerequisite for brain death			0
@entity36 similarly took issue with the brain scan that allegedly showed blood flowing to @entity0 's brain			1
he said the test doctors and researchers from the nonprofit @entity163 used was incorrect and would not have demonstrated such blood flow			0
@entity0 's mother , @entity83 , has worked to keep her daughter 's organs functioning on life support , first at @entity87 in @entity18 and later at an undisclosed medical facility , and now a house in @entity90			0
unlike @entity19 , @entity90 law allows families to reject a declaration of brain death on religious grounds and allows brain - dead patients to remain connected to ventilators .			1
