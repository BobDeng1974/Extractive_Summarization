proceedings : @entity21 's murder trial started this week at the @entity143 courthouse in @entity33 prosecutors have said @entity21 claimed he was n't near the @entity27 home at the time of the killing , but they are expected to introduce cellphone records that allegedly prove he was in the area when two teenage girls who live nearby heard gunshots			1
the witnesses did n't immediately report the shots to police because the sound of gunfire is n't uncommon in the impoverished , crime - ridden @entity158 neighbourhood , according to court filings			2

there are thousands of boarded - up buildings in the city 's most notorious neighbourhood there are a host of reasons for @entity158 's downward spiral			2
but they mostly boil down to an exodus of families from an area that was predominantly single - family homes , resulting in an explosion in the number of abandoned buildings , and an influx of gang @entity209 to 100,000 residents in 1960 , @entity158 's population has dwindled			1
it had dropped to about 40,000 in 2000 and to 30,000 just 10 years @entity214 of the reason is that families moved out to safer places and others lost their homes when they lost jobs during the @entity221 to the police department , there are more than 4,100 abandoned buildings in @entity158 , nearly 600 of them vacated in just the last 15 months			2
