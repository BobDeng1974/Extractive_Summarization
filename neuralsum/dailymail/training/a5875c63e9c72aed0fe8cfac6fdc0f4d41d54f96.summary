president @entity0 dodged a question on friday about whether @entity3 troops will be part of a new @entity6 rapid response force in @entity7 set up to warn @entity8 that @entity10 nations could quickly mobilize if an allied country in the region were to come under attack			1
@entity6 secretary general @entity14 said the new unit would send a clear message to potential aggressors in a thinly veiled warning to @entity19			1
' should you even think of attacking one ally , you will be facing the whole alliance , ' he declared as a two - day @entity6 summit in southern @entity24 drew to a close			1
but when @entity0 was asked point - blank if he will send troops , he talked only of financial assistance			1
@entity47 is reportedly considering the same level of commitment			0
' in @entity50 , ' @entity0 said during a press conference in @entity24 , ' i announced $ 1 billion in our initiative			2
a sizable portion of that will be devoted to implementing various aspects of this			0
' he discussed the need to support @entity6 's plan with logistical help to plan troop rotations and execute ' air policing , ' saying money from @entity66 ' allows us to supplement it			1
' ' we want to make it crystal clear : we mean what we say when we talk about @entity72 5 commitments , ' @entity0 pledged			2
during a press briefing on tuesday , a @entity75 spokeswoman told reporters that she was ' not ruling anything in or out ' on the question of @entity3 troop deployments under @entity6 's banner for the new force			1
but the @entity83 wrote wednesday that @entity3 ' will contribute troops and equipment ' to the new @entity6 contingent			1
there was no confirmation of that report when @entity6 announced its rapid - response plan friday			1
it no longer appears accurate			0
@entity14 said in a press release friday that @entity6 would set up a command and control presence and a location where allies can pre-position equipment , supplies and planners			2
' @entity6 will step up intelligence sharing , upgrade defence plans and hold more short - notice exercises as well , ' the announcement stated			1
there were no final decisions on where the forces would be based , but @entity14 said @entity108 , @entity109 and the @entity110 have all indicated a willingness to host the facilities			2
@entity113 prime minister @entity46 said his nation is willing to contribute 3,500 personnel to the rapid response force			0
he said its headquarters could be in @entity108 , with forward units in the easternmost @entity6 member countries and equipment stockpiled there in advance			1
' we must be able to act more swiftly , ' @entity46 said			0
the summit coincided with the start of peace talks involving @entity36 , @entity8 and @entity128 rebels that kicked off friday in @entity129 , @entity130			2
the talks are aimed at achieving a cease - fire to bring an end to the months of fighting between @entity36 forces and pro-russian separatists			0
the two signed an agreement on a ceasefire on friday which is due to take effect later in the day			0
@entity6 's push to build a new rapid - reaction force signals growing impatience with @entity8 's incursion into @entity36 , and with that country 's constant defensive military posture @entity3 president @entity0 , right , stood alongside @entity113 prime minister @entity46 , center , and @entity6 secretary general @entity14 ( left ) during a military jet flyover at the @entity6 summit @entity36 president @entity151 confirmed that envoys in @entity129 , the capital of @entity130 , signed theagreement			1
rebels announced the deal separately on @entity155			0
despite the ceasefire , rebels said they were still seeking separation from @entity159			0
while @entity151 voiced ' careful optimism ' about the talks , @entity10 leaders remain skeptical			0
the @entity3 and @entity7 have warned that they stand ready to levy more economic sanctions on @entity8 , a step a top @entity165 official said could occur within days			1
the crisis in @entity36 has been among the most pressing issues on the agenda during the @entity6 meetings			2
while @entity36 is not part of the @entity6 alliance , @entity8 's actions have prompted fears among member countries in @entity177 and @entity7 that the @entity178 could seek to make gains beyond their borders as well			1
@entity14 said the high - readiness force would give @entity6 a ' continuous presence ' in @entity7 , with alliance countries contributing forces on a rotational basis			1
confronting another pressing international crisis , @entity14 said @entity6 stands ' ready to help ' @entity187 fight back against a violent militant group , but noted that the @entity187 government has not made any such request			0
@entity46 and @entity3 president @entity0 have been pressing their @entity6 counterparts to join a coalition of nations that could degrade militants from the @entity198 group			1
in the two - day @entity6 summit , leaders discussed the situations in @entity36 and @entity202 the threat posed by the @entity204 ( @entity204 ) overshadowed some of the @entity207 's official agenda			2
yet the leaders still spent a considerable amount of their time discussing the crisis in @entity36 , with @entity36 president @entity151 taking on a high - profile role during the talks			0
in another signal of its commitment to protecting its members in @entity7 , @entity6 announced that its next summit will be held in @entity50 , @entity108 , in 2016			1
@entity108 president @entity218 praised the alliance 's willingness to boost its presence in the region , calling it ' a matter of key importance to @entity108 's security			2
' ' there is progress in raising @entity6 combat readiness , ' @entity218 told reporters			0
he said the rapid response force would comprise up to 5,000 troops , with its command stationed in @entity108			1
on the sidelines of the summit , @entity46 and @entity0 were also meeting with their counterparts to rally support for a mission to confront the @entity198 through military might , diplomatic efforts and economic penalties			0
both leaders had meetings planned friday with @entity244 president @entity243 , a key regional player whose support would be crucial to defeating the militants			0
@entity0 also met friday morning with @entity248 president @entity247			0
@entity14 suggested that @entity6 was unlikely to take imminent military action against the militants in @entity187 , but said he could foresee the alliance engaging in a ' defense capacity - building mission ' there			2
the @entity3 is already launching airstrikes against the @entity198 in @entity187 , and @entity42 has joined up for humanitarian aid drops to besieged minority groups			0
@entity0 is weighing whether to extend the military mission into neighboring @entity257 , where the extremists have establisheed a safe haven			0
on other fronts , alliance leaders pressed @entity6 countries to follow through on commitments to spend 2 percent of their nations ' gross domestic product on defense			2
only four @entity6 nations meet that threshold : the @entity3 , @entity42 , @entity270 and @entity271			1
@entity218 said that @entity108 would raise its defense budget to 2 percent of @entity273 in 2016 and would encourage other members to increase defense spending as well .			0

quick - reaction force falls short of the *permanent* @entity6 bases @entity108 and other eastern countries wanted
@entity6 presence could deter @entity8 and other aggressors by serving as a *trigger* to activate @entity3 troops
@entity75 said tuesday that it wo *n't* ' rule anything in or out ' regarding a @entity3 ground - troop component
but when @entity0 was asked point - blank if he will send troops , he talked only of financial assistance
