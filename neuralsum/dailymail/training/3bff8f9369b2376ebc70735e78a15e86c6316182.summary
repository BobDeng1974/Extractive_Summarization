by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today became the latest politician to be hit by the curse of local radio			1
the prime minister was reprimanded live on air after repeatedly referring to @entity8 while being interviewed on @entity9			1
broadcasting from @entity10 , mr @entity2 admitted he was confused about the area he was speaking to , before hastily trying to change the subject			2
prime minister @entity2 , on a visit to @entity14 in @entity10 today , became confused about where he was broadcasting to while on @entity9 with less than a year to go until the general election , all party leaders are desperate to have airtime in every part of the country			1
but doing a round of back - to - back local radio interviews seems to be most perilous way of trying to reach the electorate			1
today mr @entity2 annoyed presenter @entity25 by repeatedly referring to examples of how the economy was flourishing on @entity8			1
eventually she snapped : ' you keep mentioning the @entity29			1
that 's not our region prime minister			1
i 'm sorry , we are the @entity35			2
' sounding distinctly flustered , mr @entity2 replied : ' i 'm sorry , i thought i was doing ...			0
' before going on hastily to point out that the government was investing £ 90 million in the @entity37			0
but that did nothing to placate ms @entity25 who pointed out that it was pouring £ 470 million into @entity41 and £ 440 million into the @entity42			0
' ninety million pounds seems like a drop in the ocean to me , ' she said			0
the @entity35 and the @entity29 are separated by the @entity45 in the @entity46 of @entity47 spot the difference : the prime minister referred to the @entity29 ( left ) while broadcasting on local radio covering the @entity35 ( right ) @entity51 , @entity52 mp for @entity53 and @entity54 said mr @entity2 is ' out of touch ' and disinterested in @entity56			1
he said : ' over the last four years of @entity2 we 've had a @entity59 peer calling the region ' desolate ' , frequent misspellings of @entity56 in official number 10 letters and now the prime minister himself ca n't even take the basic cue of appearing on @entity9 to get the hint that our river is the @entity35 and not the @entity29			1
' this just highlights how @entity2 is out of touch with the region and completely disinterested in places like @entity53 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity54			0
' however , @entity52 politicians are not immune to the pitfalls of local radio			1
earlier this month shadow business secretary @entity77 faced ridicule after mis - pronounced @entity79			0
as he took to the local airwaves to promote @entity52 ’s latest policy , he bizarrely referred to people on the streets of @entity84 , a city in @entity85 4,400 miles away			2
before may ’s local elections , @entity52 leader @entity86 was also caught out during an interview on @entity89			2
@entity90 , the interviewer , asked him what he made of ‘ @entity92 ’ without saying who he was			0
mr @entity86 asked him to repeat the question but then admitted he had no idea who he was talking about , and asked the presenter to ‘ enlighten ’ him			2
in a toe - curling exchange , mr @entity90 told him mr @entity92 was the @entity86 on @entity100 council			0
mr @entity86 then blundered again by referring to mr @entity92 as the leader of @entity100 council , when in fact the council is controlled by conservatives			0
flailing , mr @entity86 said : ‘ i think he is doing a good job for @entity52 on the council			0

prime minister angers @entity9 presenter with gaff about @entity29
he was appearing on @entity9 , a different part of the @entity46
the curse of local radio strikes again for another leading politicians
