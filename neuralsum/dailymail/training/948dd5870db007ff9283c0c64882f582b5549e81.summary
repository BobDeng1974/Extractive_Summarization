by @entity0 published : 09:42 est , 20 july 2013 updated : 09:46 est , 20 july 2013 wasted : the @entity2 has bought 2million too many bullets for troops in @entity5 this year the @entity2 has bought twice as many bullets as it needs for troops in @entity5 , at a cost to taxpayers of around £ 500,000			1
the department has ordered around four million bullets , despite the fact that forces will be slowly withdrawn from @entity15 throughout the year			1
the @entity2 has said it expects it will need only around 50 per cent of the bullets as troop numbers are reduced from 8,000 soldiers to around 5,000			1
but it has admitted it is tied into contracts - described as ' committed purchases in the system based on previous estimates ' - which means it has had to pay for the full amount			2
the extra bullets can not be saved for future conflicts as they have a use - by date after which the propellant perishes and they become useless			1
the @entity2 has already started recycling 400 tonnes of brass ammunition casings to save costs after installing a furnace at @entity34			2
out - of - date bullets are also being destroyed at a facility in @entity37 , which aims to recycle 95 per cent of the material			1
but the department has admitted there are ' limited outlets for reusing ammunition ' and that it is attempting to negotiate selling surplus bullets back to manufacturers			0
in an article in the government department 's own magazine , @entity47 , the 2million wasted bullets are compared to a family having to throw out mouldy yoghurts			1
' it happens in every household , ' the report said			0
' you get to the end of the week , and you are cursing yourself for buying all those yoghurts you have n’t eaten			0
and despite being determined to keep the housekeeping costs under control , yet again you are pitching out products past their sell by date			0
' the purchasing of ammunition is organised by the defence general munitions project team , part of the @entity2 's @entity64			2
conflict : the number of troops in @entity5 is being reduced from 8,000 to around 5,000 this year the @entity62 's colonel @entity68 told @entity47 : ' supplying safe and suitable munitions to meet operational and training requirements while reducing your spend and using up your stockpile holdings means striking a very fine balance			0
' buy too much and your stockpile goes up , buy too little and you risk putting personnel in danger of running low at a critical moment			0
' an @entity2 spokesman : ' it is wrong to suggest that the @entity2 has been wasteful			2
no - one would want our troops to run out of ammunition whilst on operations and we have to plan for the worst possible scenarios – it is clearly better to have more than enough ammunition than not enough			0

@entity2 bought *4million* bullets despite reduction in troop numbers in @entity15
around half will be wasted as they are unlikely to be fired by use - by date
*official* magazine compared blunder to family having to throw out old food
