by @entity0 published : 16:41 est , 30 june 2013 updated : 02:18 est , 1 july 2013 like many a @entity3 winner before him , @entity1 pledged that his £ 12.3million jackpot would not change his life			1
now , 16 years after that lucky day , it seems he has stuck to his promise – and has spent hardly any of his winnings			1
mr @entity1 , 46 , still works as a furniture restorer and still lives with his elderly parents in the terraced home they shared before his win			1
secret millionaire : @entity1 cleaned outside his garage , near his home in @entity17 unassuming : @entity18 say mr @entity1 acts like his win never happened because he is happy with his life and the only visible sign of substantial spending at the family home is new double glazing			1
mr @entity1 has , of course , spent a little more than that – though no - one would accuse him of going mad			1
a new work van has been bought as well as a caravan in @entity27 and a 4x4 @entity28			1
the car is thought to have been for his parents			2
he has also dabbled in the local property market , buying a handful of homes to rent out – although the entire portfolio is worth less than £ 250,000 , according to records at @entity36			0
jackpot : mr @entity38 vowed he would not let his 12.3million win in may 2007 change him			2
the only frivolities he has allowed are personalized number plates by contrast , a shrewd investor could by now have more than doubled mr @entity1 ’s original fortune with timely investments in property			1
perhaps the only frivolities he has allowed himself – or rather his family – are personalised number plates for his father ’s van and a @entity51 , which he gave to a relative			1
following his may 1997 win – which back then was the fourth biggest in @entity3 history – mr @entity1 admitted he had never had a girlfriend or travelled abroad , and said his only passion was fine furniture			1
after leaving school aged 16 , he trained as a cabinet maker and furniture restorer , and despite the huge change in his circumstances , he insisted he had everything he wanted in life			1
‘ i ’m an ordinary , quiet introvert , ’ he said at the time			0
‘ this may change me but i hope not			2
’ on the subject of romance , he said : ‘ any girlfriends from the past will probably come from my days in kindergarten			0
miss @entity72 may be out there			0
who knows what fate may bring			0
’ and it seems mr @entity1 continues to resist the temptations of wealth which most of us can only dream about			2
new windows : @entity1 has not moved from the family home he shares with his parents recently , he was seen tidying up outside his workshop in an unassuming suburban garage attached to a hairdressing salon , just a few minutes ’ walk from his home in @entity17			1
armed with a shovel and wheelie bin and dressed in blue jeans , a checked shirt and sensible black shoes , passers - by would hardly have guessed they were watching one of the wealthiest men in the city			0
‘ it ’s almost as though his lottery win never happened , ’ one neighbour said			0
‘ most people would have used a fortune like that to fulfil all their dreams , but evidently @entity1 ’s perfectly happy as he is			2
’ at the family home , it is clear it has been treated to a lick of paint recently , as well as hanging baskets to smarten it up , and a satellite dish belies another little luxury			0
his parents , @entity115 , 76 , and @entity116 , 74 , arrived at the house in their six - year - old @entity28			0
when asked whether her son had ever embraced a millionaire lifestyle , mrs @entity118 replied : ‘ he ’s not gone anywhere			0
’ however , she declined to discuss whether he had finally found his miss right			0
mr @entity1 is not the only lottery winner to try to hold on to their old life			2
@entity126 , from @entity127 in @entity27 , scooped £ 9.3million in 2004 aged 62 but carried on working as a cleaner at an activity centre .			0

@entity1 , 46 , still works as furniture restorer and lives with his parents
has stuck to his promise that he would *n't* let his winnings change him
gave a @entity51 to a relative and bought a new work van for himself
