@entity0 has revealed he is receiving psychological help in a bid to overcome the problems that have seen him suspended twice in 15 months for biting opposition players			1
the @entity8 international 's most recent offence occurred during the @entity9 , where he was caught sinking his teeth into @entity13 defender @entity12 's shoulder			1
that incident saw him handed a four - month suspension from all football , after he had been banned for 10 games for doing the same thing to @entity21 defender @entity20 in a @entity23 match against @entity21 in april 2013			1
he told @entity42 : ' after the suspension i had some really hard times			0
i 'm getting psychological help and the club have been a constant support			0
' as he moved ever closer to his return to football against @entity34 on october 25 , @entity0 was also accused of being fat by sections of the press , but he has now spoken out against those who questioned his fitness			1
@entity0 scored against @entity55 , but @entity8 were denied by a late equaliser and then in a shootout the Â£ 75m @entity33 forward equalised for @entity8 , but his side drew 3 - 3 and then lost 7 - 6 on penalties ' i was never overweight			1
it was just as @entity61 said on one occasion : " tell me when you see @entity0 thin "			0
' the doctor who carries out the medicals at the club said that i was one of the six players at @entity33 who had the lowest percentage of fat and lowest weight			1
it was all part of the newspapers ' game			0
' his inability to control his temper has seemingly been the factor behind @entity0 's omission from the list of candidates for this year 's @entity81 , but rather than protest against the snub , the former @entity83 man is remaining philosophical , while targeting his first league goals for his new club			2
@entity0 is yet to open his account for new side @entity33 after making four appearances so far the former @entity38 striker shakes hands with old boss @entity93 after winning the @entity94 ' i 'm sure i have n't been nominated because of what i did at the @entity9 , ' he added			1
' but in that case , they should take into account all those who did nothing at the @entity9			2
' it hurts you , because i did a lot of things at @entity38 last year			2
but in football there 's always another chance			0
' i 'm not worried			0
if i do n't score goals and we win , i 'll be happy all the same			0
i really want to celebrate a goal in the shirt of the team i 've always dreamed of - but we all have droughts			0
