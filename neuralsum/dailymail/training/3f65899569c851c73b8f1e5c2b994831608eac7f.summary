by @entity0 a hobbyist gardener has spoken of his anguish after finding out the model village he spent decades painstakingly constructing has crumbled and decayed			1
@entity4 , 59 , started his model village outside his home in the @entity8 suburb of @entity9 as a hobby in 1978			1
the project , complete with terraced houses , a village bakery and tiny bicycles for the imaginary residents soon became a tourist attraction and hundreds flocked to view it			1
sad state : the model village in the @entity8 suburb of @entity9 once drew hundreds of tourists overgrown : since the original architect @entity4 moved in 1993 his models have not been preserved heyday : the village , pictured above in the 1980s , was once carefully tended and ringed with flowers shop : the village bakery has its own carefully - painted sign and used to boast miniature cakes in the window workmanship : tiny bikes were once parked outside the bakery , with minute electric bulbs in the rooms mr @entity4 's intricate wonderland , featuring tiny paved pathyways , glass - panelled windows and electric lights , was always left open to curious passers - by and became a firm part of the landscape			1
but since mr @entity4 , a former gardener for @entity45 , retired and moved to @entity46 in 1993 , the houses have slumped into decline			1
although the first new owner offered to look after the carefully - built homes , successive rounds of inhabitants have not taken care of the houses , which now sit in a sorry state outside the detached property			1
mr @entity4 , 59 , from @entity56 only realised what a bad state of repair the model properties were in when he went back to @entity9 last year			1
recalling the visit , he said : ' i was disappointed to see them in such a bad state and even knocked on the door to say hello to the new owner			1
' ' when i left the houses were in perfect condition			2
the first person who bought the house wanted to look after them			2
' i did n't think about taking them then because they have been part of that area for so long			2
they 're part of @entity8 's history			1
i really enjoyed building and having them			2
' from a distance : here the village can be seen in perspective in front of mr @entity4 's detached former home detailed : the rows of terraced houses in mr @entity4 's garden were given names , as was the village pub intricate : the windows had tiny panes of glass , and paths between the houses were lined with tiny pebbles @entity97 : mr @entity4 's project began when he was 24 , in 1978 , and continued for decades mr @entity4 had combined his passions of architecture and horticulture to start the project from drawings back in 1978			1
then 24 and already working as a gardener for @entity45 after completing an apprenticeship straight from leaving at 16 , @entity4 decided to give himself a project and a hobby and built his own village using sketched blueprints pencilled out in his attic			1
according to the @entity113 blog by 1988 the project was complete , with intricate details such as tiny glass windows which glowed from the real electric lights			1
the bakery boasted miniature cakes in the windows and there were flowerbeds , and tiny bicycles leaning against a shop window			2
one miniature house , a tudor style detached is engraved in the names of @entity127 and @entity128 after the names of the mothers of himself and his partner			2
it was dated 1988 and split into two businesses - one a toy shop and the second a post office and general groceries			1
it even had its own pub called @entity140 of @entity141 , named after a local children 's hospital which has since closed and there was a row of terraced houses named @entity146			2
mr @entity4 said : ' i always liked model villages and architecture and if i was clever i would have liked to have been an architect but i ended up having a lovely career in horticulture			1
roofless : the new owner , who declined to comment on the village , has allowed the houses to decay careful construction : the thatched roofs of the terraced houses can be seen here in their original form - the tops of the homes are now bare playground : pictured is mr @entity4 's niece enjoying the village in an earlier state in the 1970s come on in : mr @entity4 's nephew , pictured , demonstrates the tiny scale of the properties by posing next to one in the late 1970s ' i just collected some stones and started my first one in 1978			1
i did little drawings and did all the woodwork and built on flat stones in the attic then put everything together in the front garden			1
' they took about six weeks each			2
my @entity183 then wired them all up so each one lit up from a switch in the kitchen and it looked lovely in @entity188			2
' all the children had grown up with it			2
there is a school not far from us and everybody used to stop on the way and have a look			2
it made me feel happy			2
i have five brothers and two sisters so lots of nieces and nephews who have grown up with it			0
i did it because i liked seeing other people happy			0
' we would have liked to have brought them to @entity46 but the cost was quite a lot			0
it 's a shame they have fallen into disrepair			0
if i had lived there i would have repaired them			0
it was quite the local attraction at the time			0
it 's quite sad to see them as they are now			0
' mr @entity4 met his partner @entity219 , a former head gardener at @entity220 in @entity9 , in 1976			1
they entered into a civil partnership on december 21 , 2005 - the day it became legal			1
' makes me want to cry ' : @entity8 residents have mourned the decline of the attraction under new owners the couple 's creative streak was reflected in their garden and also that of their new property in @entity46 which has also become a tourist attraction as a 4 - star venue for holidaymakers to the south coast			1
mr @entity4 added : ' seeing the finished product and watching people enjoying it was the best thing			1
we both worked with the public so we did n't have a problem with them coming into the garden			0
' when i left the houses were in perfect condition			0
the first person who bought the house wanted to look after them			0
i did n't think about taking them then because they have been part of that area for so long			0
they 're part of @entity8 's history			1
i really enjoyed building and having them			0
' @entity259 , 56 , a former neighbour , said : ' the miniature houses were lovely and they 're part of @entity8			1
i remember them from being little			0
i used to walk past and look and always wanted to play with them			0
two have been demolished since then			0
mr @entity4 always used to keep them well			1
he would put new roofs on and make sure the windows were ok			0
as fashions on houses changed he would change the mini ones			0
' the people that have them now have really let them go			0
it makes me want to cry , especially remembering how they used to be			0
anyone that has lived around here will know about them			0
' they could at least have kept them tidy			0
if people tried to renovate them i know a lot of people would chip in			0
loads of people would love to see them restored to their former glory			0
' when approached to discuss the houses , the current tenants at the property declined to comment			1
a man who answered the door said : ' i do n't want to talk about it and do n't have to reveal my reasons why			0

intricate model village was built by gardener @entity4 , 59 , in the 1970s
*expanded* and became more *complicated* until mr @entity4 moved in 1993
village in @entity8 , @entity9 , is now overgrown and decayed
locals are disappointed - but new owners would not comment on decline
