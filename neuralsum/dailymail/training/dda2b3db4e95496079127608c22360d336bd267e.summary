drivers often feel they need eyes in the back of their heads to see the growing number of bikes weaving their way through the traffic			0
and cyclists often wonder whether the motorist in the car next to them has even spotted them			0
now @entity12 is attempting to address this problem – and the growing toll of deaths and injuries caused by collisions between cars and bikes			1
the system produces a range of alerts to tell drivers if a cyclist is getting too close			2
using the traditional ‘ ring ring ’ of the bicycle bell , a warning will sound inside the car from the direction in which the bike is approaching			1
it will also ‘ tap ’ the driver on the right or left shoulder using a device that makes the seat cushion inflate and contract			1
even the door handles of the car will ‘ buzz ’ to prevent doors being opened into the path of bikes which are alongside			2
the accelerator pedal will vibrate if moving the car would cause an accident			0
the new ‘ @entity22 ’ safety system is to be fitted into new @entity12 , @entity24 and @entity25 cars within two years and aims to help reduce the toll of 19,000 cyclists killed or injured on @entity59 roads each year instant warning : @entity62 ’s new system uses warning colours ( pictured ) , sounds and even touch to trigger an instinctive response from the driver in a bid to prevent such accidents the aim of the system , says @entity12 , is to ‘ engage drivers ’ natural instincts ’ to help motorists be more alert to cyclists who may be pedalling too close to danger			1
it will also help spot motor - cyclists – with a separate motorbike - horn warning			0
around 19,000 cyclists are killed or injured on @entity59 roads each year			1
motorists can easily risk hitting a cyclist undercutting on the left			2
even minor accidents can lead to disputes , confrontation , personal injury claims and counter-claims			0
many cyclists now wear helmet - mounted cameras and film their journeys to use as evidence in the event of a collision – and some motorists are fitting cameras to their windscreens			2
regardless of who is at fault , it is usually the cyclist who comes off worst in any encounter with a car			0
and no driver wants a seriously or fatally injured cyclist on their conscience			2
a @entity62 spokesman said : ‘ sensors on the car will detect when another road user is approaching and identify it as bicycle or motorbike			0
' it will then make the driver aware of the potential hazard before the driver sees it			0
’ @entity118 : even the accelerator pedal will vibrate if moving the car would cause an accident the system will make the driver aware of the potential hazard before the driver sees it			2
but instead of using a generic warning symbol or sound , which takes time for the driver ’s brain to process , the system uses lights and sounds that the driver instinctively associates with bicycles the @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ to help the driver understand where the bike is in relation to their car , the audio system will make it sound as if a bicycle bell or motorbike horn is coming through the speaker nearest the bike , so the driver immediately understands from which the direction the cyclist is coming ’ but instead of using a generic warning symbol or sound , which takes time for the driver ’s brain to process , the system uses lights and sounds that the driver instinctively associates with bicycles			1
the spokesman explained the expanding and contracting seat : ‘ if a bicycle or motorbike is coming up the road behind the car , @entity22 will detect if it is overtaking or coming past the vehicle on the inside			1
‘ the top of the car seat will then extend to “ tap ” the driver on the left or right shoulder			1
the idea is that the driver will then instinctively look over that shoulder to identify the potential hazard			0
’ @entity178 ’s campaign manager @entity177 said : ‘ we would support any move by manufacturers to improve cyclists ’ safety			1
’ official statistics show that in the 12 months to june , the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured rose 10 per cent			1
silly or sensible ? the new hat comes with a plate cycling helmets are becoming increasingly sophisticated , but one conceptual design , which is packed with technology , includes a controversial extra – a licence plate			0
the ‘ @entity198 ’ is designed for ‘ responsible cyclists ’ and could include a visor showing safety information and a map , if it ever enters production			1
it also features a licence plate on the rear of the futuristic design , in a bid to make identifying cyclists easier			0
the concept , by @entity207 - based designer @entity206 , has aggravated some cyclists who think that @entity198 is a silly idea			0
this is because the website claims : ‘ apart from safety considerations , an @entity211 system would allow cyclists to share responsibility when interacting with vehicles and pedestrians			1
’ while it may not be popular with all cyclists , the idea has apparently got the green light from a local city council , which is keen on licensing cyclists , @entity219 reported .			0

the new ‘ @entity22 ’ safety system is to be fitted into new @entity12 , @entity24 and @entity25 cars within two years and aims to help reduce the toll of 19,000 cyclists killed or injured on @entity59 roads each year
@entity12 has *embraced* the traditional ‘ ring ring ’ of the bicycle bell to warn drivers of *unseen* cyclists at risk of injury or death in a collision
it will also ‘ tap ’ a driver on the right or left shoulder using a system that causes the seat cushion to expand and contract .
