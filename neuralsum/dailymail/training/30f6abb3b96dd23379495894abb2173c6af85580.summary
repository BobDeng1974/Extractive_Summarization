yesterday , assistant commissioner @entity21 , who has responsibility for inquiries sparked by the phone - hacking scandal , told the @entity25 that officers are trying to get a copy of the recording and would ‘ assess the full contents of that tape ’			1
the dramatic development came as the @entity33 media , culture and sport committee revealed it intended to summon the 82 - year - old press baron for a second time in the autumn over the comments			2
in the tapes , @entity0 expresses his fury at ‘ incompetent police ’ as he tries to placate staff furious at dawn raids at their homes , arrests and criminal charges			1
in one exchange , the @entity49 boss is told that dubious ‘ working practices ’ at @entity52 went back many years			2
he says : ‘ we ’re talking about payments for news tips from cops			0
that ’s been going on a hundred years , absolutely			0
you did n’t instigate it			0
’ critics say the tape shows @entity0 ’s real attitude to the crisis , in contrast to the apparent contrition he displayed when giving evidence to @entity67 two years ago			1

@entity0 is heard railing at the way the police behaved			2
‘ it ’s a disgrace			0
here we are , two years later , and the cops are totally incompetent , ’ he said			1
‘ the idea that the cops then started coming after you , kick you out of bed , and your families , at six in the morning , is unbelievable			0
‘ but why are the police behaving in this way ? it ’s the biggest inquiry ever , over next to nothing			0
and now they ’re arresting their own , who never even took money … they ’re going to put all newspapers out of business			0
’ when asked why so much material had been given to police , @entity0 branded it a ‘ mistake ’ but said a new lawyer had ended the deal , adding : ‘ [ @entity120 ] has said ‘ no , no , no – get a court order			1
