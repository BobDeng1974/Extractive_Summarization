a probe hurtling towards @entity1 has captured the dwarf planet locked in a mesmerising dance with its largest moon , @entity5			1
the @entity7 spacecraft took the footage as it raced through space to rendezvous with the dwarf planet in 2015			2
the 12 images that make up the animation were taken from a distance ranging from 267 million to 262 million miles ( 429 million to 422 million km )			2
scroll down for animation a probe hurtling towards @entity1 has captured the dwarf planet locked in a dance with its largest moon put together , the footage covers @entity1 and almost one full rotation of its largest moon , @entity5 , which orbits 11,200 miles ( about 18,000km ) above the dwarf planet 's surface			1
@entity5 is almost half the size of @entity1			0
the moon is so big that @entity1 and @entity5 are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system			1
the mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on @entity1 's position against a backdrop of stars – to fine - tune the distance that @entity7 will fly past @entity1 and its moons			1
@entity1 's four smaller satellites are too faint to be seen in these distant images , but will begin to appear in images taken next year as the spacecraft speeds closer to its target			0
the mission team are now using the footage - which focuses on @entity1 's position against a backdrop of stars – to fine - tune the distance that @entity7 will fly past @entity1 and its moons there remain many unanswered questions about @entity1			1
the @entity7 probe ( artist 's impression pictured ) hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on july 15 , 2015 the artist 's concept shows the @entity1 system from the surface of one of the smaller moons			1
@entity1 is the large dwarf planet at centre , right			2
@entity5 , the system 's largest moon , is the smaller body to the right of @entity1 ' the image sequence showing @entity5 revolving around @entity1 set a record for close range imaging of @entity1 - they were taken from 10 times closer to the planet than the @entity67 is , ' says new horizons mission principal investigator @entity68 , of the @entity69			1
@entity5 is almost half the size of @entity1			0
the moon is so big that @entity1 and @entity5 are sometimes referred to as a double dwarf planet system			1
the distance between them is 12,200 miles ( 19,640 km )			0
@entity5 's orbit around @entity1 takes 6.4 @entity67 days , and one @entity1 day takes 6.4 @entity67 days			2
@entity5 neither rises nor sets , but hovers over the same spot on @entity1 's surface			1
the same side of @entity5 always faces @entity1 -- this is called tidal locking			0
compared with most of the planets and moons , the @entity1 - @entity5 system is tipped on its side			0
' but we 'll smash that record again and again , starting in january , as approach operations begin			0
' we are really excited to see our target and its biggest satellite in motion from our own perch , ' he adds , ' less than a year from the historic encounter ahead			0
' @entity7 is near the end of its final @entity98 annual systems checkout and instrument calibration before @entity1 arrival			0
the @entity7 mission operations team at the @entity101 in @entity102 , @entity103 , will put the spacecraft back into hibernation on august 29 - just four days after @entity7 crosses the orbit of @entity107 on august 25			0
that final ' rest ' lasts only until december 6 , when @entity7 will stay wake for two years of @entity1 encounter preparations , flyby operations , and data downlinks			0
there remain many unanswered questions about @entity1			0
the @entity7 probe hopes to provide some answers when it flies by the dwarf planet on july 15 , 2015			1
pictured here is a scale comparison of @entity67 and its moon ( left and top right ) and @entity1 and @entity5 ( bottom right )			2
@entity5 , the dwarf planet 's largest moon , is almost half the size of @entity1			1

footage was taken from a distance of more than *250* million miles
it was captured by @entity7 probe which will fly by @entity1 next year
animation shows @entity1 and almost one full rotation of its largest moon
@entity5 orbits 11,200 miles ( 18,000km ) above the dwarf planet 's surface
