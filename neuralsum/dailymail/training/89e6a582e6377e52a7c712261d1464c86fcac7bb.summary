thirty children from @entity3 in @entity4 aged eight to 11 were handed shotguns and taught how to shoot at clay pigeons with live ammunition			1
it was part of an event organised run by instructors from the @entity19 to help educate the youngsters about the countryside			2
but the move has been condemned by anti-guns campaigners , who argue that a young child is not mature enough to handle a weapon			0
head teacher , @entity2 , said the day 's shooting in july helped educate children about the food chain and instilled skills such as self - discipline and commitment to a task			1
he told the @entity34 : ' we need to get beyond the @entity36 , behind - desks model of education and get children actively involved			2
' we are a successful school , rated good with excellent features by inspectors , because we teach this way			0
' mr @entity2 said he also wanted to promote equal opportunities , as his catchment has a large proportion of children entitled to @entity47 , an indicator of poverty			1
he wanted these children to have equal access to the opportunities , normally reserved for private school children			1
he said : ' it 's about trust			0
we trust independent school children everywhere to shoot at this age , so why do we not trust children at state - run schools ? ' just because parents have more money , that does not mean the kids are any more reliable			1
' mr @entity2 insisted that all the parents supporting the school 's shooting day			1
' there will always be those who disagree , ' he said			0
' but people should be trusted with the full picture on the issue so they can make an informed judgement			0
you never know , people may come to a conclusion that they previously did n't think possible			0
' @entity19 spokesman @entity76 stressed the organisation runs events like this for children regularly and its instructors were trained to the highest of standards			0
he said : ' we 're not talking about @entity83 from the pub teaching them how to shoot			0
our guys have very strict assessment procedures			0
' everything was under supervision , everything was safe , everything was responsible , and police approval was given for shooting on the land			0
' mr @entity76 added the youngsters were given instruction in how to use shotguns ranging in size from between 20 to 28 bore depending on the child using it			2
the shotguns have the capability to kill a small animal , such as a rabbit or a pigeon , although no live targets were used on the day			1
but @entity105 of the @entity107 's @entity106 condemned teaching young children to shoot			1
he said : ' @entity106 is absolutely committed to keeping guns away from children			0
mr @entity2 said parents at the school , which is rated ' good ' by @entity114 , supported the day trip ' guns are dangerous weapons , which are frequently misused			1
no child should be taught to shoot until the age of 18 when they assume adult rights and responsibilities			0
' @entity123 , founder of the family pressure group , @entity125 , added : ' i 'm sure parents would agree that there are better places to take children such as sailing and climbing			0
' i really think we 're going down a dangerous road when we start introducing youngsters to guns or any sort of weapons and expecting them to understand that these are for recreational purposes - some will and a lot wo n't			2
' there is no legal or physical barrier to teaching shooting from a young age , so why delay ? ' @entity145 , @entity146 ' we are putting information that may not be backed up with the right kind of support at home into very young children 's hands			1
' the @entity146 ( @entity153 ) currently works with 43 prep schools and has 39 prep school members in the @entity107			0
@entity145 , secretary of the @entity153 , said that shooting teaches children to control their emotions and to think about the consequences of their actions			2
she said : ' there is no legal or physical barrier to teaching shooting from a young age , so why delay ? ' the benefits that shootings bring are as applicable to younger students as older ones ; and there is an argument that the younger the benefits and skills that come from shooting are instilled , the better the long - term impact			2
' @entity176 , chief executive of the @entity177 , added : ' with niche sports such as archery and clay pigeon shooting , children can find an area outside the classroom where they can excel , which can be incredibly rewarding and also builds their confidence to be the best they can be across the entire curriculum			1

youngsters were given shotguns to shoot live rounds at clay pigeons
