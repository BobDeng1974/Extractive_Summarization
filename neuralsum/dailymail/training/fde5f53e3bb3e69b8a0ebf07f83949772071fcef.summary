a woman accused of force feeding her five - year - old son salt through a stomach tube reveled in the attention that a sickly child brought her , a prosecutor said on thursday at her trial			1
@entity9 eventually killed the boy , @entity11 - @entity10 , because she feared he would start telling people she was making him ill , assistant district attorney @entity13 suggested in closing arguments			1
' the motive is bizarre , the notion is scary , but it exists ... she apparently craved the attention of her family , her friends , her co-workers and most particularly the medical profession , ' she said			0
relished : @entity9 , pictured on february 3 , allegedly enjoyed her ill son 's attention as she fed him salt @entity9 ' created this false persona , this caring mother , ' @entity13 said			1
blogging about life as a mother , @entity9 posted updates on various social media sites about her sons alleged ailments , which prosecution claims were false diagnoses			1
what she did to her son was ' nothing short of torture , ' the prosecutor said before the @entity41 jury began deliberating charges of depraved murder and manslaughter			1
earlier , defense lawyer @entity46 described @entity9 , of @entity47 , @entity48 , as a caring mother who was devastated by her son 's death			1
he suggested the hospital was to blame — an assertion @entity13 called ' just ridiculous ' — and tried to cast doubt on the medical examiner 's finding that high salt was the cause of death			2
the prosecution says @entity9 induced brain swelling by feeding @entity11 heavy concentrations of sodium through a stomach tube			1
jurors saw a video that showed @entity9 taking her son into a hospital bathroom with a connector tube and the boy suffering afterward			1
a feeding bag found in @entity9 ' apartment had the equivalent of 69 @entity75 's salt packets in it , a forensic toxicologist testified			1
the defendant , who was depicted during the trial as unemotional , wept at times as her lawyer spoke			2
' she loves her son very much			2
she cared deeply if he lived or died , ' said @entity46 , who added that @entity9 collapsed when she learned of her child 's death , and did @entity83 searches about how to commit suicide with insulin			2
poignant : @entity9 is seen here with her son @entity11			1
video shown in court allegedly shows her taking him from his bed to a bathroom where prosecutors say she used his stomach feeding tube to inject him with salt horrific : @entity9 wept as a court watched video last week of what prosecutors allege shows her 5 - year - old son @entity103 writhing and screaming in pain after she injected him with a fatal dose of salt when edited - out scenes of the hospital video are restored , it ' paints a completely different picture ' than the prosecution 's , he said			1
missing scenes show @entity9 putting two pairs of socks on @entity11			2
' if she 's planning on killing him , why does she care whether his feet are cold ? ' ' mother of the year , ' the prosecutor later said sarcastically			0
hospital charts and video show a nurse failed to replace ' the necessary maintenance fluids ' that were being given to @entity11 to keep him hydrated during bouts of diarrhea , @entity46 said , adding that a doctor testified that water loss and no replacement fluids can lead to high salt levels			0
afterward , @entity11 was given a rapid infusion of fluids			0
the makeup of the fluids is not known , but it was reasonable to conclude that it had too much sodium , he said			0
the fluid was changed when ' they realized he was getting a fluid high in sodium chloride , ' @entity46 said			0
' at the very least it 's reasonable doubt			0
' a call to a @entity146 spokeswoman requesting comment was not immediately returned			0
doctors testified that a child fed in an ordinary fashion would spit out that much salt			0
but @entity11 had a feeding tube because his mother told doctors he could not keep food down otherwise			0
prosecutors said @entity157 , who documented her son 's hospital and doctor visits on social media , claimed the boy had illnesses he did not have			0
a friend told the jurors that after @entity11 died , @entity9 asked her ' to go to her house and get a feeding bag in the middle of the room and throw it away and not tell anybody			1
' @entity46 said the chain of custody could n't be trusted and the bag could have been tampered with			0
