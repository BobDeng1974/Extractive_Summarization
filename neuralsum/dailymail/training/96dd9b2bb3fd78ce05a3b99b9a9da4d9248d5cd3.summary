by @entity0 and @entity1 the @entity2 has rejected another product with ' redskin ' in the name , the latest sign that it might rule against the @entity7 in an ongoing trademark case			1
the agency said monday that ' @entity10 ' would be considered disparaging because the product does n't contain redskin potatoes and therefore would be associated with the football team			1
the ruling then stated that current evidence reflects that ' a substantial composite of @entity17 find the current use of " @entity7 " in conjunction with football disparaging			1
' trademark : the @entity2 has rejected another product with ' redskin ' in the name , indicating it might rule against the @entity7 in an ongoing trademark case the agency issued a similar ruling in january , rejecting ' @entity27			1
' the agency is considering whether to revoke the trademark protection for the @entity31 team , part of a long - running challenge from a group of @entity35			1
a hearing was held 12 months ago			1
team owner @entity37 says respect goes both ways when it comes to the debate over the team 's nickname - confirming he will not be bowing to public pressure to change it anytime soon			2
the man who ultimately gets to decide whether the name stays or goes offered his thoughts on the matter in october in a letter to season - ticket holders , the first time he has addressed at length the change - the - name campaign that has picked up momentum this year			2
the tone of the letter suggests that no change is under consideration			2
' i 've listened carefully to the commentary and perspectives on all sides , and i respect the feelings of those who are offended by the team name , ' the letter states			2
' but i hope such individuals also try to respect what the name means , not only for all of us in the extended @entity7 family , but among @entity35 too			1
' the letter recalls @entity37 's experience when he attended his first @entity7 game at age 6 and cites polls and anecdotal evidence that indicate support for the name from @entity35			1
it also states that the original @entity7 had a @entity17 coach in the 1930s before the franchise relocated to @entity85 , even though research shows that it is unclear whether @entity90 ' @entity89 ' @entity88 was an actual @entity91 or whether he stole the identity of a missing man from the @entity94			1
outdated ? @entity95 , unofficial mascot of the @entity7 , signs autographs during fan appreciation day at the @entity7 ' @entity31 football training camp at @entity7 in @entity100 , @entity101 in 2012 ' the name was never a label , ' @entity37 's letter states			1
' it was , and continues to be , a badge of honor			2
' while there have been groups calling for a name change for decades , a series of events this year has put the @entity7 on the defensive like never before			1
@entity37 has hired @entity113 , an adviser in the @entity114 who specializes in managing political crises , as an adviser on the matter			2
the letter released in october shows more sensitivity than the owner 's last on - the - record comment on the topic , when he told @entity123 in may : ' we 'll never change the name			2
never — you can use caps			2
' @entity85 's @entity31 team , the ' @entity7 ' has also come in for concerted pressure from @entity17 activists and a few media outlets , along with president @entity133 , to change its name leaders in @entity85 and some members of @entity137 have called for a name change , and some media outlets have stopped using the name			1
it is also the subject of a long - running legal challenge from a group of @entity17 seeking to void the team 's federal trademark protection			1
@entity91 activist @entity147 , a major figure in the trademark case before the @entity2 , was unimpressed with @entity37 's letter			1
she disputed several points , including the reference to @entity88 , whom she said is part of the team 's ' time - dishonored history of putting up pseudo-indians as part of their promotion			0
' @entity147 also rebuffed an assertion by @entity37 that the team has an obligation to its fans to preserve its heritage			0
' part of that heritage and tradition is name - calling , belittling and maligning native peoples , ' @entity147 said in an email to @entity1			0
' the n - word was traditional and had quite a heritage , too			0
happily , not all traditions are carried on forever			0
' support : a @entity7 fan shows his support for rebranding the @entity179 capital 's beloved american football team at a symposium hosted by the @entity181 on october 7 , 2013 last week , president @entity133 told @entity1 that he would ' think about changing ' the name if he owned the team			1
this week , the @entity31 said it will meet with representatives from the @entity181 , which has been airing radio commercials pushing for a change			0
commissioner @entity187 said tuesday that the league needs to ' carefully listen ' to critics of the name and ' make sure we 're doing what 's right			0
' like @entity147 , @entity194 representative @entity193 differed with the interpretation of the team 's history in @entity37 's letter			0
@entity194 said the team 's nickname ' was deliberately designed to denigrate people of color			0
' ' unfortunately that ploy was successful , ' @entity193 said in a statement			0
' the marketing of this racial slur has had — and continues to have — very serious cultural , political , and public health consequences for my people and native americans everywhere			0
it is clear from mr. @entity37 's letter that he does not understand those consequences			0
' team : @entity7 owner @entity214 , left , and @entity7 general manager @entity215 walk together from the @entity31 fall meeting in @entity85 , on tuesday , oct. 8 , 2013 in the statement , @entity193 invited @entity37 to take part in the tribe 's upcoming meeting with the @entity31			1
@entity85 coach @entity221 said he was glad that that @entity37 ' expressed exactly how he feels from an ownership standpoint			0
' @entity187 has said that it is ultimately @entity37 's call as to whether the name will be changed			0
for now , it appears the owner is not budging			0
' i respect the opinions of those who disagree			0
i want them to know that i do hear them , and i will continue to listen and learn , ' the letter states			0
' but we can not ignore our 81 year history , or the strong feelings of most of our fans as well as @entity35 throughout the country			0
after 81 years , the team name ' @entity7 ' continues to hold the memories and meaning of where we came from , who we are , and who we want to be in the years to come			1

@entity2 says ' @entity10 ' would be considered disparaging because the product does n't contain redskin potatoes
in its ruling trademark officials said ' a substantial composite of @entity17 find the current use of " @entity7 " in conjunction with football disparaging . '
the @entity7 have been in an ongoing battle with the @entity2 over the use of ' @entity7 '
