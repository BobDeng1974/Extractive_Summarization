by @entity0 published : 04:07 est , 12 november 2012 updated : 10:19 est , 12 november 2012 @entity2 's rubbish sent to @entity3 for recycling is being returned to @entity2 landfills because the quality is so poor			1
nearly 70 per cent of plastics able to be recycled are shipped to the @entity8 as @entity2 households fail to re-use and process them at home			1
historically , @entity3 accepted it to process the materials			2
waste is being sent back to @entity2 landfills after @entity3 has rejected low quality plastics do n't dump it here : @entity3 has cracked down on the type and quality of materials it processes but the country has now clamped down on the low quality of items sent to it - particularly those that have been ' contaminated ' , the @entity22 reported			1
the @entity28 has warned that in this year alone 17 containers , containing 420 tons of plastic , have been refused by @entity32 countries as the government cracks down on ' dirty ' plastics			1
recycling experts warned of a ' plastics mountain ' if @entity3 cracks down further , according to the @entity22			0
@entity3 announced in october that it may enforce regulations that would spell disaster for @entity2 in terms of dumping their waste elsewhere			1
the regulations ban imported unwashed post-consumer plastic , any waste being transferred to a company other than that stated on the import licence ; and stopping the trade of unwashed plastic leftover from the sorting of imported plastic and paper			2
now @entity53 has warned that @entity3 may stop accepting unwashed , household plastics scrap altogether as it strives to recycle only high quality materials			0
households have not been properly processing their waste , despite efforts to encourage people to make more of an effort most local authorities in @entity61 do not insist people categorise their rubbish , allowing them to lump all recyclable materials such as plastic and glass into once collection			2
despite this jumble of mixed materials , a recycling facility sorts them - but even this will not meet the standards demanded by the @entity3 as bales are often ' contaminated ' by households throwing the wrong sort of thing in the recycling bin			0
@entity79 , the environment secretary , said he was aiming to improve @entity2 ’s recycling infrastructure and not rely on outsiders to help with the country processing its waste			1
he told the @entity22 : ' trade in recyclable materials is a global market and i want to see @entity2 businesses make money from it to help boost our economy			1
' i want to see our own recycling industry grow , so we can grasp this opportunity with both hands			0
' despite his statement , figures revealed that millions of tons of household rubbish was burned instead of recycled by councils last year			0
the amount sent to incinerators shot up by almost a quarter - while the amount sent for recycling went up by barely a single percentage point			0
the burning boom means millions of families who have been forced to cope with fortnightly collections , rubbish rationing and wheelie bin fines in the name of saving the environment now have to live with the pollution risks of incinerators			0
the @entity116 in south @entity3 ’s @entity117 is one of the country 's most well - known dumping grounds for other nation 's rubbish .			0
