by @entity0 published : 17:54 est , 30 november 2013 @entity2 : 20:34 est , 30 november 2013 @entity3 was last night accused of being at the centre of a ‘ coalition cover - up ’ over bombshell emails that reveal how he helped to fast - track £ 12 million of taxpayers ’ money to a charity linked to his wife			1
a watchdog , acting on the advice of a cabinet minister , has banned the release of all correspondence relating to the @entity18 case on the grounds that it would have a ‘ chilling effect ’ on the government			1
the ban – condemned by one of the deputy prime minister ’s own @entity26 mps – follows a year - long drive by the @entity29 to suppress details of how one of mr @entity3 ’s advisers successfully lobbied for @entity18 to receive automatic funding , rather than having to bid against other charities			1
@entity3 ( pictured with his wife @entity35 ) was accused of ' covering up ' emails which revealed how he helped to fast track £ 12million to a charity linked to his wife the £ 12 million award came shortly after @entity40 had hosted a lavish reception for the charity – which promotes reading – a fact mentioned by mr @entity3 ’s aide @entity44 during the lobbying process			1
it led to angry exchanges within @entity48 after mandarins argued that abandoning procedures to favour the charity was unfair			2
now , after a battle by this newspaper to see the emails under @entity56 , information commissioner @entity52 has ruled that they should be kept secret			2
he said that after reading the ‘ candid and frank ’ emails he had concluded their disclosure ‘ would be likely to prejudice the conduct of @entity22 ’			0
the ban was even condemned by the deputy prime minister 's own @entity26 mps in his ruling , mr @entity52 , advised by cabinet office minister @entity64 , admitted there was ‘ a public interest in the processes that lead to such decisions being transparent ’ because the funding decision ‘ may have an effect on the educational opportunities for children ’			1
significantly , he added : ‘ the public interest in ensuring such transparency in this case is increased given the specific circumstances of this case which the [ @entity79 ] has highlighted			0
there is genuine public interest in the disclosure of information which would inform the public as to whether or not there has been any impropriety in the awarding of these funds			0
’ but he decided this was overridden by the need for ministers to be ‘ able to inform themselves about how the implementation of @entity22 policy might affect the government as a whole ’ , adding that this ‘ was particularly important for the prime minister and deputy prime minister who must have an overview of the government ’s activities ’			1
he concluded : ‘ the withheld information contains candid and frank exchanges that were clearly conducted with the expectation that they would be treated confidentially			0
’ this led him to conclude : ‘ disclosure of the withheld information would have been likely to result in a chilling effect and thus potentially inhibit the contributions of individuals when providing advice to other departments			0
’ last night , @entity26 mp @entity115 said : ‘ where public money is involved i think there should be a clear audit trail , and i am surprised that they did not release , at the very least , a few redacted emails			2
‘ they seem to have taken a @entity124 vow of silence			0
we should know how decisions such as these are made now , not have to wait 30 years for the release of @entity22 papers			0
’ @entity131 mp @entity130 said : ‘ this looks a lot like a @entity135 cover - up – mr @entity64 protecting his new friends in the @entity26			0
if they had wanted to disprove any allegations of impropriety , they could have released a section of the emails to rebut that charge without jeopardising either officials ’ identities or the confidentiality of @entity22 business			0
’ mr @entity3 ’s office maintains that the decision on @entity18 ’s funding was taken ‘ in an entirely proper way by the secretary of state for education ’			1
there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by @entity18			2
a @entity29 spokesman said : ‘ there is no question of any undue influence or pressure being brought to bear by the deputy prime minister			1

deputy prime minister helped push through *multi-million* grant to @entity18
his wife @entity35 hosted lavish reception for charity shortly before decision
