@entity0 will hope for great things from their two most experienced bowlers			2
@entity3 and @entity4 have 600 test wickets between them — and 70 of those have come at @entity8			1
while @entity3 has picked up 49 scalps in seven @entity10 at 17 apiece — with six five - wicket hauls — @entity4 has managed 21 at 22 in five , including a hat - trick against @entity13 in 2011			1
@entity3 , who almost singlehandedly beat @entity14 here a year ago with 10 wickets in the match , needs five more to become the leading wicket - taker in tests in @entity0			1
he currently has 225 , one behind @entity19 and four behind @entity20			0
expectation : @entity3 and @entity4 have to perform for @entity0 @entity22 figures : @entity4 , @entity3 and @entity23 at a training session ahead of the first test 42 five tests are being squeezed into 42 days — one of the shortest series ever.14 @entity13 have n’t won any of 14 away @entity26 since beating @entity29 in @entity30 in june 2011			1
swing spells trouble the @entity8 pitch has always been batsman - friendly — but it ’s the notorious swing that can cause problems and undo teams			0
@entity0 ’s past seven first - innings totals here have been a mixed bag : 229 v @entity39 in 2006 , 198 v @entity13 in 2007 , 364 v @entity40 in 2008 , 354 v @entity41 in 2010 , 221 v @entity13 in 2011 , 428 v @entity29 in 2012 and 215 v @entity14 in @entity42 @entity23 may not see @entity8 as the place to kick - start his revival			1
in 13 test innings he has scored only one half - century — against @entity14 last year — and averages just 21			0
that makes it his least favourite venue in @entity0			2
his next - lowest average is 37 , at @entity51			0
under fire : captain cook must perform against @entity13 @entity54 : @entity23 with @entity13 captain @entity55 holding the series trophy the opposition only two members of @entity13 ’s likely starting xi have played @entity26 in @entity0 before : captain @entity55 ( right ) , who played on the 2007 and 2011 tours , and fast bowler @entity62 , who was part of the side that lost 4 - 0 here three years ago			1
but @entity65 holds one happy memory			0
it was here in 2007 , when @entity69 was greeted by a handful of jelly beans , that they achieved one of only two @entity26 victories in @entity0 since 1986			2
the other came at @entity51 in 2002 .			0

@entity3 and @entity4 need big *performances* against @entity13
as does *struggling* @entity0 captain @entity23
@entity13 set to start with an *inexperienced* side in the first test
