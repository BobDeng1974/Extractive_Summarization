by @entity0 , mail on sunday security editor published : 16:28 est , 8 june 2013 updated : 21:05 est , 8 june 2013 @entity2 was warned six months ago that @entity4 snooping laws were being used to spy on our communications			1
the revelation comes as mps prepare to fly out to @entity9 to raise concerns about @entity4 spies passing on internet data to the @entity2 ’s intelligence gathering centre , @entity14 in @entity15			1
yesterday , sir @entity17 , chairman of the intelligence watchdog , the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) , said he expected a response from @entity14 over claims that it had gathered data from @entity4 internet companies which had been obtained under a new @entity4 law			1
concerns : spy centre @entity14 , @entity14 , in @entity15 sir @entity17 said : ‘ the @entity16 is aware of the allegations			2
the @entity16 will be receiving a full report from @entity14 very shortly and will decide what action needs to be taken			0
’ but a report commissioned by the @entity32 warned in january that the law allowed @entity4 security agencies to demand to read our emails or see social media pages if they could show that the information might be of value to @entity4 interests			1
the report said that the draconian powers , which apply to all @entity4 companies , are a ‘ grave risk ’ to the rights of @entity32 citizens			1
the report authors , who included @entity48 , a former head of privacy at @entity50 , say data held by @entity4 internet companies ‘ becomes liable to mass - surveillance – for purposes of furthering the foreign affairs of the @entity4 ’			1
police have stored details of 15 billion journeys made by motorists on a ‘ @entity63 ’ database that even chief constables admit raises privacy concerns			0
as many as 8,000 cameras are automatically taking photos of 26 million number plates every day in a bid to track criminals			0
officers can keep the images taken on the @entity71 ( @entity73 ) system for two years			0
but following pressure from the home secretary and data watchdogs , police chiefs concede that blanket use of the cameras ‘ impacts significantly on the privacy of law - abiding citizens ’			0
now the @entity83 has set out 14 ‘ golden rules ’ to ensure use of the cameras is lawful , which could mean fewer journeys being stored			0
@entity88 , of civil liberties group @entity63 , said : ‘ if police forces are abusing their access to @entity73 data by ignoring data protection law then officials have some serious questions to answer			0
’ the document says @entity32 citizens should be warned that the information will be freely accessible to the @entity4 authorities and calls for @entity32 citizens to be given the same rights as @entity4 citizens in @entity4 courts			2
leaks last week claimed that @entity14 accessed data on the internet activity of @entity2 obtained by a @entity4 spying programme called @entity106			1
@entity4 ’s @entity107 is able to access the internet data under the @entity109 which is designed ‘ to facilitate the acquisition of foreign intelligence information concerning @entity113 persons located outside the @entity4 ’			1
it is claimed that the @entity107 and the @entity115 have accessed the systems of nine of the world ’s top internet companies including @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity50 , @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			0
according to the leaked document , ‘ special programmes for @entity14 exist for focused @entity106 processing ’ – suggesting the @entity2 agency may have been receiving material from a part of the programme specifically designed to meet its needs			2
senior tory @entity135 said it was difficult to reconcile @entity14 ’s statement that it was subject to proper scrutiny with the fact that @entity141 had no knowledge of the activity			0
‘ since nobody knew it was happening at all there is no possibility of complaint , ’ he said			0
shadow home secretary @entity149 said : ‘ it is important for the @entity2 intelligence community to be able to gather information from abroad , particularly in vital counter-terror work			2
however , there also have to be legal safeguards in place			0
’ @entity157 , of civil rights group @entity158 , said : ‘ these reports suggest a breach of trust on the grandest scale			1
’ but @entity164 mp @entity163 , a former @entity2 army intelligence officer , said : ‘ i can not see what all the fuss is about			2
communications data is an essential tool in countering terrorism			2
aware : sir @entity17 , chairman of the @entity16 , said he expected a response from @entity14 over claims that it had gathered data from @entity4 internet companies			1
