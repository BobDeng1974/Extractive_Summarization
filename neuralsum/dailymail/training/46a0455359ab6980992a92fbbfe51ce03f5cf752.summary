@entity3 's ' paranoia was obvious ' during this meeting and he was asked if he had ever considered harming himself			2
he replied that he had not and that he loved his wife and children			2
dr @entity88 thought his medication needed to be reviewed and thought it best that was done with the accused being admitted to @entity79 , but there were no beds available			0
