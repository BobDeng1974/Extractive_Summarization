homeland security secretary @entity0 on tuesday defended to @entity1 the @entity4 administration 's decision to allow millions of illegal immigrants relief from deportation even as conservatives on @entity8 aggressively pushed to defund parts of his department			1
@entity0 spoke at a hearing before the @entity12 that marked the first public hearing on president @entity4 's executive actions , which are expected to allow as many as five million immigrants to remain in the @entity16 indefinitely , since he announced them late last month			1
the @entity19 head begged lawmakers today not to express their anger at the president and the administration over immigration through the appropriations process			1
' that is in my judgement a very bad idea for @entity19 because during that period of a continuing resolution we can not engage in new starts , ' he told them			1
' we 've got some @entity19 priorities that need to be funded now			1
the department head pointed out that a new presidential election cycle is about to being and he would n't be able to hire new @entity47 agents to protect candidates until @entity19 is fully funded for the entire fiscal year			1
furthermore , he said he would n't be able to fund ' our enhanced detention capability in @entity51 with another continuing resolution that gets me to march			0
' ' i need the help of @entity1 to support and build upon border security , which i believe all of you support , ' he said			0
' so , i 'm urging that we act on our current appropriations request now for the purpose and for the sake of border security and homeland security , ' @entity0 concluded			1
republicans in the @entity12 and @entity65 who are deeply opposed to providing amnesty to illegal immigrants have been lobbying their colleagues to pass appropriations legislation that would only fund the @entity19 through early 2015 , when they take control of both chambers of @entity1			1
at that time they would be able to insert language into a long - term spending bill that would hinge funding for certain immigration agencies and operations on ceasing implementation of @entity4 's immigration actions			1
house speaker @entity79 reportedly endorsed the plan in a closed - door meeting today , setting up his party 's attempt to block the president 's immigration policy in january and a head - to - head fight with the @entity12			1
at a press briefing afterward he said his conference had not coalesced around a specific plan yet , however			0
' i said before @entity91 that @entity64 would fight his unilateral actions , ' the @entity64 leader said			0
' we ’re looking at a variety of options , both for right now and when republicans control both houses of the @entity1 next year			0
and we ’ll continue to discuss with our members a number of options , in terms of how we will deal with this , in consultation , again , with the members			0
' but no decisions have been made at this point , ' he added			2
if @entity1 does n't pass new spending legislation by dec. 11 the federal government will shut down until it does			2
senate minority leader @entity110 has been adamant that wo n't happen , saying again today a shut down is not in the cards			1
however , he confirmed that @entity64 , who are currently the minority in the @entity65 , would support whatever bill their colleagues in the @entity12 sent over			1
' in the short - term , the @entity65 will be in a reactive role , he said			1
' next year , we 'll be sort - of more co-equal partners on that issue			0
' but right now , our view is once it 's sorted out in the @entity12 , once it gets passed , i 'll be supportive of that			2
' the @entity12 has made its preference that legislators pass a yearlong spending bill for all government agencies known several times over			1
certainty is good for the economy , @entity12 spokesman @entity129 said today			1
' were hopeful that @entity64 will follow their own advice in that regard and pass a full - year fed budget , ' he added			0
@entity129 said @entity12 officials ' certainly take some heart ' in @entity138 's promises that there will not be a government shutdown next week			2
house speaker @entity79 of @entity141 said after a @entity12 @entity64 caucus meeting at the @entity8 today that his members had not yet determined how it planned to avoid another politically damaging shutdown while holding the president accountable for his immigration actions republicans on @entity8 unleashed their fury over the immigration actions today at @entity0			1
regardless of where you stand on the issue , there ’s a right way to do this and a wrong way , ' the committee 's chairman , rep. @entity150 said			0
' this is not how democracy works			0
' @entity0 told the committee he recommended each action @entity4 took and continues to stand behind them			1
' the reality is that , given our limited resources , these people are not priorities for removal , ' he said			0
@entity150 , a @entity64 , said the president 's directive would be perceived as amnesty to those considering crossing the @entity16 border with @entity175 , though			0
' if we do n't think that message is making its way back to @entity175 and @entity179 , we are simply fooling ourselves , ' he said			0
' we will see a wave of illegal immigration because of the president 's actions			2
' @entity0 said the new measures are not amnesty			2
' the current situation is amnesty , ' he said furthermore , he said administration officials ' feel that we had no choice ' to act given that @entity1 could n't come to an agreement on comprehensive reform of its own			0
@entity150 argued that @entity4 did not have the authority to authorize the order , however			0
in response , @entity0 defended the legality of the action , saying those who drafted the plan worked closely with the @entity199 's @entity198			2
' i ’m satisfied as a lawyer myself — and the person who has to come here and defend these actions — that what we have done is well within our existing legal authority , ' he told the committee			0
the @entity12 said today it was not surprised that the @entity64 tore into @entity0			1
' @entity64 have long ... adopted the view - that 's contrary to the view of the vast majority of @entity16 - that we shouldnt reform our broken immigration system , ' he said			2
their views on immigration are ' stark contrasts ' to those of the president , law enforcement officials , faith leaders , and even some of their fellow @entity64 , he added			2
later in his briefing on tuesday @entity129 told reporters , ' the fact is the closest thing we have to amnesty in this country is doing nothing			0
' and that 's exactly what @entity64 seem to be doing , he charged .			0
