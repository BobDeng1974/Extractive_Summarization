by @entity0 if heights are n’t your thing , you might want to steer clear of a new skyscraper in @entity5			1
@entity6 have announced they are to build the world ’s fastest ultra-high - speed elevator in the @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity5			1
the building will be completed in 2016 , and inside will be the rapid lifts that can climb 95 floors in just 43 seconds			1
the @entity9 finance centre , artist 's illustration shown , will house the world 's fastest elevator			1
built by @entity6 it will be capable of ascending at 1,200 metres per minute the @entity9 is an upscale mixed - use skyscraper that will provide office , hotel and residential space			1
in total the giant structure will have 111 above - ground floors and five below - ground floors			0
it is being built in the city ’s @entity29 , with the goal of fully opening the building in 2016			0
while it is not the tallest skyscraper in the world , its elevators will certainly be something to behold			1
in total the structure will have 95 elevators but only two will hold the accolade of being the world ’s fastest			2
# 5 : @entity44 – @entity45 , @entity46 : 1,129 feet ( 344 metres ) speed : 20.5 mph ( 33 kph ) ground to roof : 38 seconds * # 4 : @entity5 @entity49 – @entity50 , @entity51 : 1,083 feet ( 330 metres ) speed : 22 mph ( 35 kph ) ground to roof : 33 seconds * # 3 : @entity53 – @entity54 , @entity55 : 2,717 feet ( 828 metres ) speed : 22 mph ( 35 kph ) ground to roof : 82 seconds * # 2 : @entity57 – @entity57 , @entity58 : 1,670 feet ( 509 metres ) speed : 37.7 mph ( 60.1 kph ) ground to roof : 30 seconds * # 1 : @entity59 – @entity10 , @entity5 ( to be completed 2016 ) height : 1,739 feet ( 530 metres ) speed : 44 mph ( 70 kph ) ground to roof : 43 seconds * * if travelling at full velocity the elevators are powered by a magnet synchronous motor , which allows for the high output needed to attain the high speeds			1
at maximum velocity the elevators will ascend at nearly 4,000 ft ( 1,200 metres ) per minute			2
this is equivalent to 44mph ( 70kph )			0
when descending the elevators are slightly slower at 2,000ft ( 600 m ) per minute , or 22.4mph ( 36 kph )			2
the elevators will climb from the ground floor to the 95th , and they will be able to make the journey in 43 seconds			0
@entity6 say the elevator will have technologies that support safe and comfortable elevator operation , so passengers will have a comfortable ride even at these high speeds			0
the company has a history of making speedy climbers – back in 1968 it designed @entity83 ’s fastest elevator at the time in the @entity84 , which travelled at a rather more sedate 980 feet ( 300 metres ) per minute			2
there will be a variety of safety measures in their latest elevator			0
these include braking systems and emergency stop devices that can detect excessive speeds			0
the brakes have outstanding heat resistance too - even in the unlikely event of a malfunction , they can stop the elevator during high - speed operation			1
to retain a level of comfort , guide rollers in four corners of the elevator car can also detect sideways vibrations due to wind pressure			0
and to prevent a person 's ears popping , @entity6 will change the air pressure in the car as it ascends and descends			0
construction on the @entity113 building , previously the @entity114 , began in 2010 ( picture taken on 23 december 2012 ) and is due for completion in 2016			2

a new skyscraper in @entity5 will have the fastest ultra-high - speed elevator
the @entity9 is due for completion in 2016
inside it will have two of the rapid elevators along with *93* ' slower ' ones
the two will be capable of travelling *3,940ft* ( 1,200m ) a minute at top speed
this makes them the fastest elevators in the world , travelling at 44mph ( 70km ) , *beating* the previous record - holder by about 8mph
