@entity0 has been threatened by @entity2 with court action a 100 - year - old grandmother faces being taken to court on christmas eve by ‘ heartless ’ council officials over a nursing home bill			1
@entity0 , who is deaf and blind , has received letters from @entity2 demanding she pay more than £ 9,000 in fees for her care			1
with less than £ 3,000 in the bank , mrs @entity0 can not pay			1
her only son , @entity11 , 71 , says he has repeatedly tried to explain to officials that neither of them can afford the sum			1
but to his ‘ disgust ’ , on december 9 the council gave his mother just two weeks to pay or face court action			1
it means proceedings against mrs @entity0 – who has two grandchildren and four great - grandchildren – could begin on christmas eve			1
the letter stated : ‘ in the event that you do not respond within fourteen days of the date of this letter we are instructed to issue proceedings , without notice , in the @entity31			1
any such claim will incur further costs and interest			0
’ mr @entity11 , from @entity34 , @entity35 , who was diagnosed with bowel cancer last year , said : ‘ they ’re absolutely heartless			2
i do n’t feel like it ’s @entity40 now			0
i ’m just worried all the time about what ’s going to happen with this bill and i have n’t got the money to pay it			2
' how can you threaten to take a 100 - year - old woman who is registered blind and deaf to court on christmas eve ? ’ the retired businessman said his illness forced him to put his mother in @entity49 nursing home in january as a ‘ last resort ’			1

after he died 33 years ago she volunteered at an elderly people ’s day centre			0
however , by 2003 her sight and hearing had become so poor that she was no longer able to live alone			0
mr @entity11 estimates that he has since spent more than £ 120,000 on her care			2
in april last year he was diagnosed with cancer , and had chemotherapy and several operations			0
he reluctantly decided to find his mother a home			0
mr @entity11 says @entity35 council agreed to cover most of her care while she contributed £ 500 a month			1
but in september he was told her fees had risen and she owed £ 9,697 – which came as a ‘ complete shock ’ , he said			1
mrs @entity0 , with her husband on their wedding day in 1936 , can not afford the £ 9,000 nursing home fees last night the council said it tried to assess her means , but ‘ information requested had not been provided ’			1

he added : ‘ i ’ve only got my pension and my mum has n’t got any money			0
