@entity0 will aim to continue his astonishing scoring streak against @entity2 at @entity3 on saturday , having been feted as ‘ better ’ than @entity4 — his childhood idol			1
last month , @entity7 coach @entity6 suggested that his team ’s supreme finisher had become a more deadly threat than @entity4 , who terrorised @entity2 at the 1995 @entity11			1
@entity0 has certainly demonstrated a greater scoring knack , having touched down 29 times in @entity14			1
he is on course to be the most predatory accumulator of tries in the history of the international game — eclipsing @entity4 and other @entity21 icons such as @entity22 and @entity23			1
@entity0 sprints clear to score one of his two tries in @entity7 victory at @entity3 last year and while the @entity28 wing known as the ‘ bus ’ has caused havoc against all - comers , he has been especially prolific whenever he has had the @entity32 in his sights ; striking eight times in just four matches			1
@entity6 ’s tribute to his demolition man in the @entity39 shirt was emphatic			1
‘ i think he ’s probably better than @entity4 , ’ he said during the recent @entity40			1
‘ he can do more things than @entity4			1
@entity4 was a great player , but i think @entity0 has got more to his game and that ’s saying something			1
he ’s very good going back , under the high ball , with the ball on the ground , as well as being a greater carrier			0
’ @entity0 was reminded on tuesday of being placed on a higher pedestal than his iconic hero and he found it difficult to come to terms with such heady praise			2
@entity4 on his way to scoring one of his four tries against @entity2 in the @entity60 @entity4 and @entity0 are similar in stature and the younger has drawn many comparisons to his idol ‘ for @entity6 to compare me to @entity4 and say i am better was an honour and a privilege , ’ he said			1
‘ but for me , no - one ’s better than @entity4			2
‘ he was my idol growing up			0
i even had his haircut ! i fell asleep at the barbers and the guy shaved it off			0
@entity4 changed the game back in his era and inspired a lot of kids , so to me no - one is ever going to be better			2
he was one in a million			0
’ @entity0 is 24 , and was only four when @entity4 created one of the game ’s enduring images as he trampled @entity78 and @entity79 under foot on his way to scoring against @entity2			1
his stunning performance in that 1995 @entity11 semi-final led the then @entity2 captain , @entity83 , to label him a ‘ freak ’			2
asked if he recalled the game , @entity0 smiled and said : ‘ i remember that ! ’ @entity0 has scored an incredible 29 tries for @entity7 in just 30 appearances @entity0 is 13kg lighter than @entity4 in his prime , but is creating similar mayhem among opposition defences as the great man once did , and he is crossing the line more often , too			1
asked if he hoped to surpass @entity22 ’s national try record of 49 in 62 tests , he admitted : ‘ it would be pretty special to get there			0
’ his latest telling contribution against @entity2 was a first - half hat - trick as the @entity7 thrashed the tourists in @entity101 in june , but the executioner - in - chief is utterly modest in assessing his own devastating work			1
‘ i try to bring a lot of excitement , ’ he said			0
‘ i try to execute as much as i can			0
the boys inside me come up with their offloads and skill execution , and i ’m just happy to finish them off			0
it just happens to be against @entity2			2
’ savea races clear for his third try in @entity7 's win over @entity2 in @entity101 in june such is @entity0 ’s desire to emphasise the collective contribution to his solo feats , it is more instructive to listen to others talking about him			1
@entity7 no 8 @entity118 — the current @entity121 world @entity119 , offered a strong endorsement of his electric team - mate			2
‘ the majority of his tries are looking after a team effort and him finishing them off , but he is probably the best winger in the world at the moment			0
we just have to give him a bit of space			0
it ’s my job and our job to give him the ball in as much space as we can and let him do his thing			0
’ the hosts certainly know all about his potency			0
‘ he ’s very powerful first and foremost , ’ said @entity138 yesterday			0
@entity139 and @entity140 demonstrate an unusual training technique as @entity7 train on tuesday this time it 's @entity140 's turn to hitch a ride as @entity139 does the heavy lifting superstar @entity146 looks in relaxed mood as he wears a baseball cap during training ‘ one on one you have to be able to put your head down and get stuck in			1
he constantly holds really good width and the players inside him can get the ball to him			0
he ’s a brilliant finisher , but he ’s got that power as well			0
’ as a finisher , @entity0 is on course to trump his idol and be the greatest there has ever been			2
no matter how well they prepare , @entity2 will struggle to contain him			0
