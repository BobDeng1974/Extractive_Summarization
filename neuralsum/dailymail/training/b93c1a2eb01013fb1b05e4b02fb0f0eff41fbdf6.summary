the prankster , @entity13 , has a @entity5 channel dedicated to his passions - ' house music , comedy and pranks ' - and the video has been viewed more that half a million times in two days			1
for his latest prank , @entity13 took one very unlucky passenger on a terrifying ride in which he pretends to be a mafia hitman			1
the two discover they 're waiting for the same bus when a driver , @entity13 , recognizes @entity29 pulls up and offers him a lift			1
@entity29 asks if his new friend can come with them , and though @entity32 demurs at first , he finally accepts the ride from @entity13			2
early into the drive screaming and banging can be heard coming from the trunk			0
@entity13 tells @entity29 it 's a man who owes his boss $ 60,000 and that , ' he 's not supposed to wake up , ' pure , authentic fear and panic begins to appear on @entity32 's face			1
@entity13 pulls over to quieten down the man in the trunk , baseball bat in hand , and returns to the car satisfied there wo n't be any more noise			1
' y - you can ... i can just like ... i can like call ... call somebody and ... ' @entity32 stammers			0
' do n't call anybody , ' orders @entity13 as he cleans ' blood ' off the baseball bat			2
as the trio continue , @entity32 looks around wildly as he is driven to what can only seem to josh at this point as his demise			0
' um , excuse me , ' he says in a barely audible voice			0
@entity80 noises : @entity32 hears screaming and banging coming from the trunk of the car silent treatment : @entity13 emerges from the car and appears to violently beat the person in the trunk strike : a horrified @entity32 catches sight of the bloodied baseball bat as @entity13 returns to the car ' where are we going ? ' @entity13 tells him they 're dumping the body and that he will drop him off at his destination after			2
@entity32 's eyes are huge with fear and disbelief			0
' i 'll dump the body , and then i 'll drop you and @entity29 off			0
relax ! we 're almost there , ' @entity13 says			2
they eventually pull over in remote looking scrub to ' dump the body			0
' as @entity29 and @entity13 carry the body , wearing a very bright red bloodied t - shirt , the boy puts a shocked hand over his mouth			0
it becomes too much for him and he tries to get out of the car but discovered the doors have been child - locked			0
@entity29 and @entity13 get back in the car after dumping the ' victim ' on the side of the road			1
@entity13 grabs a gun from the glove box , to @entity32 's horror , and heads back out to the victim			1
horror : @entity32 looks on as @entity29 and @entity13 dump the ' body ' by the side of the road getaway : he tries to make his escape but the car 's child safety locks are on @entity131 shot : poor @entity32 looks on as @entity13 appears to shoot his victim @entity32 breathes raggedly and looks around in desperation for a way to escape			1
@entity13 stands over the body as the boy begins to murmer , ' oh no , oh no , no , no , ' before the sound of a shot fired echoes			0
the boy sits upright , staring out the window and not looking at @entity13 or speaking a word			0
@entity13 makes a call to his ' boss ' then begins questioning the boy as to whether he was in @entity146 last week and if he is working for the @entity147			0
the boy , flinching , says he does n't know what that is and he was not in @entity146 last week			0
@entity151 : when @entity13 gets back in the car , @entity32 ca n't even look at him jig 's up : @entity13 and @entity29 finally give up the pretense and tell @entity32 he 's the victim not of the mafia but of a prank as @entity13 threatens @entity32 with the gun , he starts laughing			1
@entity29 in the back seat also starts laughing and the boy looks at them in surprise before @entity13 informs him that he 's being pranked and that there 's a camera on the dashboard			2
the boy looks unconvinced , looking towards the bloodied body on the roadside			0
' he 's an actor , he 's an actor , ' @entity13 says , calling , ' hey ! ' to the corpse , which rolls over and gets up			2
' he 's an actor bro , this is a fake gun , dude , ' @entity13 says putting it in his mouth			2
rising from the dead : the corpse miraculously returns to life after appearing to have been viciously beaten and then apparently shot hilarious ? there are n't many people who would be amused by such a malicious prank being pulled on them , but @entity32 looks extremely relieved with the dawning realization that the horror he had just witnessed was n't real , the boy 's face floods with relief			1
the next shot is the bewildered boy being asked to sign a release form so that @entity13 can use the video and the boy can ' be on @entity5			1
' the video ends as @entity13 promises to take the boy out to eat at a buffet - small payment for the ordeal he 's just been put through in the name of fun			1
@entity13 posted the video tuesday , writing that it was ' one of the hardest and craziest pranks ' he 's ever pulled			1
he said it took two weeks to find someone who would actually agree to get in the car with @entity29 and that they took poor @entity32 to a restaurant after the prank			0
' he said he will never jump in to a stranger 's car ever again , ' wrote @entity13			2
