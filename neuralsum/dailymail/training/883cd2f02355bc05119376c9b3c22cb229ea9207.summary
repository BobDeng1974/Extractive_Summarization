by @entity0 @entity1 : 16:14 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 03:24 est , 31 december 2013 it was , perhaps , a @entity4 miracle			0
while @entity5 , a cat owner from @entity6 , slept soundly in bed on @entity8 , her beloved pet @entity10 was , she believes , out enjoying a magical ride			1
for , according to the readings from her high - tech gps collar , she managed to travel 12 miles directly across the rooftops of @entity6 in a matter of minutes - logging a top speed of 183mph			1
journey : @entity10 , pictured , was found on christmas day with her g - paws tracker hinting at a magical ride and with @entity4 in the air doing his festive rounds , ms @entity5 was left with only one conclusion to draw - that @entity10 had hitched a ride on his sleigh			1
although there were no other signs of a supernatural journey on the nonplussed moggy , nor even a whiff of reindeer , ms @entity5 discounted the possibility the @entity36 tracker had malfunctioned , and spread the word of her yuletide mystery			2
posting on @entity39 the next day , she said : ' i live alone , was asleep in bed and my cat had the unit on at the time this was recorded.the top speed was 183mph ! ' she went from my street to a location miles away in the middle of a river , then back again for a while then again to another location miles away in one minute , travelled over rooftops and then home again ! log : the readings from the @entity36 device show the route @entity10 is supposed to have taken - in a straight line over the rooftops of @entity6 ' the unit has been used on her daily for weeks with no previous issues			1
you can see the difference in how it was moving by comparing her normal meandering route and the route travelled that night - too fast for a car and not via the streets but over the houses ! ' i 've not believed in @entity71 since i was a child but think maybe she hitched a ride in his sleigh ? ' however , the makers of g - paws were not in the mood for a miracle , and pointed out that their devices are prone to giving inaccurate readings when their batteries run low			0
riding with mr @entity82 ? ms @entity5 deduced that only hitching a ride with @entity4 could have moved @entity10 so far so fast managing director @entity84 told local paper the @entity86 : ' i ’m afraid the reality is rather less exciting			2
occasionally when the unit runs a little low on power it will only take a partial reading and second guess where it is			0
' it sometimes gets it wrong which results in spikes in the tracklog			0
the best way to avoid them is to keep the unit fully charged as it tends to happen when it ’s low on power			0

@entity5 noticed her cat , @entity10 , made an *unusual* @entity4 journey
her gps collar said she had travelled 12 miles across @entity6 in minutes
she reasoned the only possibility was that her pet took a ride with @entity71
however , manufacturers say it was simply the device malfunctioning
