@entity0 fought back before eventually clinging on to edge @entity1 3 - 2 in a thrilling festive encounter at @entity3			1
@entity4 opened the scoring for the visitors after only five minutes before man of the match @entity8 and @entity9 clawed back a first half lead			0
@entity11 appeared to have sealed victory for the @entity13 after the interval , but a late strike from substitute @entity16 set up a tense finish			1
@entity19 's @entity18 was at @entity3 to assess the performances of both sets of players ... @entity8 celebrates scoring during @entity0 's 3 - 2 victory over @entity1 toon manager @entity24 ( left ) gives @entity1 counterpart @entity25 a consoling pat on the shoulder @entity0 ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity28 : @entity0 ’s makeshift goalkeeper			1
not at fault for @entity4 ’s point - blank opener and made brilliant one - handed save to deny @entity32 later despite offside flag			0
could not stop @entity16 ’s fine finish late on - 6.5 @entity35 : got forward frequently and chose short passes well			0
tidy one - twos in attack down right wing had @entity1 in circles during second half			2
lost @entity16 for late @entity1 surge , though - 6.5 @entity43 ( c ) : allowed @entity4 to get in front for simple finish early on but often @entity0 ’s last man , leading from the back			1
never gave @entity4 and @entity48 an inch after taking lead - 7 @entity51 : @entity0 have not won a game this year in which @entity53 and @entity51 have appeared together , but got rid of that unwanted statistic by setting up @entity8 ’s equaliser with cute cut - back assist - 7 @entity11 ( left ) watches as his second half strike beats @entity1 keeper @entity58 @entity59 : missing at left back when @entity53 was undone for @entity32 ’s cross and @entity4 ’s goal			1
thankfully for him did not cost them in the end			0
got more comfortable as game grew old - 6 @entity9 : few poor crosses and lacked silky touches in first half			0
made up for it with composed finish in bottom - left corner after the break and was sharp in attack in later stages - 7 @entity75 : was one - on - one to equalise but fluffed lines with poor first touch			0
much improved in second half and was dangerous whenever in attack as @entity0 looked to seal win - 7 @entity80 : returned from suspension and did nothing wrong , though largely went unnoticed in centre of pitch			2
thankless job - 6.5 goal scorer @entity8 strikes a pose in front of a pitchside camera after scoring @entity11 : won the physical battle in midfield more often than not			1
worked hard as per and was alert to punish @entity92 ’s defensive error and confirm win for @entity0 - 7.5 @entity53 ( replaced by @entity93 ) : undone by a @entity94 through ball on his inside for @entity1 ’s opening goal after five minutes			1
did n’t convince as much as his team - mates in this win - 6 @entity8 ( replaced by @entity101 ) : lucky to escape red for elbow on @entity32			2
right place at right time for well - taken equaliser			0
always a danger and deserved standing ovation			0
now scored as many @entity109 goals in last six appearances as he had in previous 17 - 8 @entity9 ( centre ) celebrates after sending @entity0 into the lead substitutions : @entity115 ( on for @entity116 ) : decent in closing stages as @entity0 looked to seal win			1
fresh legs for @entity24 - 6 manager : @entity24 : had his side play the short game well and controlled possession			0
an important win to those doubting his ability as manager - 8 @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 ) @entity58 : no chance of saving @entity8 ’s close range equaliser or @entity9 ’s winner			1
few questionable moves , giving away the odd needless corner as he filled in for @entity136 - 5.5 @entity32 : a perfectly - whipped cross from the right for @entity4 ’s opening goal			0
roughed up by @entity140 but took it in his stride			0
unlucky to be on losing team - 6.5 @entity145 : age catching up to the 37 - year - old			0
careless passing at times as he manned the back			0
lost his man too often - 5.5 @entity151 : out of his depth at times			0
he and @entity145 did not look adequate at the back for @entity25 - 5.5 @entity1 defender @entity32 ( left ) lunges in to prevent @entity8 taking the ball @entity156 : @entity157 start and was composed on the ball			1
looked good getting forward but ultimately on losing side - 6 @entity160 : largely anonymous in first half but chased the ball well to make @entity0 uncomfortable			2
fine ball through for @entity16 ’ goal which gave visitors hope in final moments - 6 @entity167 : most booked player in @entity109 history with 100			2
was well disciplined in @entity1 engine room but lost physical battles - 5.5 @entity172 ( replaced by @entity92 , 45 ) : @entity173 as per , closing down @entity0 when home side were in possession			1
substituted at half time for @entity177 veteran midfielder @entity167 ( left ) shields @entity11 away from the ball @entity94 ( replaced by @entity16 , 61 ) : his ball inside allowed @entity32 to cross for the opening goal			2
sacrificed for @entity16 after 61 minutes			0
looked frustrated to come off - 6 @entity181 : looked dangerous and wanted to get on ball plenty in role behind @entity4			0
once he got his chance after 63 minutes , however , he fluffed lines by sending shot well over crossbar - 6 @entity4 ( replaced by @entity48 ) : got @entity1 on their way with a well - taken goal in his first @entity109 start			1
worked hard and chased the ball well - 7 @entity92 's ( right ) mistake allowed @entity11 to score what was eventually the winner substitutions : @entity92 ( on for @entity172 , 45 ) : scored in both @entity109 appearances against @entity0 but not this time as a half time substitute			1
his mistake led to @entity11 goal , which confirmed @entity1 ’s defeat - 5 @entity16 ( on for @entity94 , 61 ) : gave @entity1 hope with goal in 84th minute			1
composed finish under pressure from approaching goalkeeper @entity28 - 6.5 @entity48 ( on for @entity204 ) : too little , too late to have an impact - 6 @entity4 ( centre ) opened the scoring or @entity1 after only five minutes manager : @entity25 : made seven changes and heavily rotated team			2
lost the passing game and looked a hurried formation at times - 6 referee : @entity213 : should have sent @entity8 off for elbow on @entity32 before striker scored @entity0 ’s equaliser three minutes later - 5			1

@entity0 defeated @entity1 3 - 2 in their @entity109 clash
@entity8 led the @entity13 comeback with his fifth goal in six games
@entity92 's mistake allowed @entity11 to score the eventual winner
