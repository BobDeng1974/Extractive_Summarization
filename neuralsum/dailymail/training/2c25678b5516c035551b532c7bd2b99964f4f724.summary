by @entity0 published : 03:28 est , 23 may 2012 updated : 08:48 est , 23 may 2012 @entity1 has been branded a ' socialist ' and unfit for office by one of @entity6 's top advisers			2
in a stinging attack on the business secretary , @entity9 , whose controversial employment reform report was published yesterday , says mr cable ' appears to do very little to support business ' despite being in charge of it in @entity15			1
@entity17 also regularly ' threatens to go nuclear ' and dissolve the @entity18 ' if he does n’t get his way ' , the venture capitalist also claimed , adding the @entity20 are damaging the @entity15 economy			1
mr @entity9 's blueprint for work reforms , asked for by @entity24 , proposed small firms be exempted from rules on unfair dismissal , company pensions , flexible working rights and even employing children			1
but @entity20 , led by @entity1 , insisted a dilution of workers ' rights on such a scale was unthinkable and argued that it would hit consumer confidence , branding @entity9 's recommendations ' bonkers '			1
@entity38 royale : @entity1 , left , is a ' socialist ' , according to @entity6 's adviser @entity9 , right , who should never have been put in charge of the government 's business brief it came as yesterday the deputy prime minister was branded a communist for declaring @entity15 a nation of snobs			1
universities should favour promising state school applicants , even if they had worse grades than private school rival , he said , but @entity52 , master of @entity53 in @entity54 , said the plan was ‘ old - style communist '			1
in an interview with the @entity58 today mr @entity9 said the business secretary ’s objections to his report are ' ideological not economic '			1
' i think he is a socialist who found a home in the @entity20 , so he ’s one of the @entity66 , ' he added			1
' i think people find it very odd that he ’s in charge of business and yet appears to do very little to support business			0
' and in a direct attack on the party he has donated thousands to , he called on the @entity74 to stand up to their @entity18 partners			2
' i do think they ( the @entity74 ) are hugely held back by the @entity20			2
i think you could put together a bunch of suggestions out of the report , as a coherent programme , that would say , you know , we are tackling the issues that business has with employment law but the @entity20 will have none of it , ' he said			2
tantrums : mr @entity9 claims that @entity17 threatens to break - up the @entity18 if he does n't get his own way and the pm should stand up to him more ' @entity17 is always threatening to go nuclear and dissolve the whole thing if he does n’t get his way with this , that and the other			1
which you ’d think actually must be a hollow threat			0
therefore , why ca n’t the government be more robust ? i do n’t know what the answer is			0
' in a speech yesterday mr @entity17 suggested society was as dominated by class as it had been almost a century ago , and universities should favour promising state school applicants , even if they had worse grades than private school rivals			1
those who ignored it would be fined , he said			0
but his comments sparked a backlash from the independent school sector			0
@entity118 mobility : @entity17 , pictured yesterday , promised that top universities would be forced to take on more state educated pupils , a move that saw him branded a ' communist ' @entity52 , master of @entity53 in @entity54 , said mr @entity17 ’s plan was the ‘ old - style communist creation of a closed market ’ that betrayed parents who paid for a private education			1
‘ many parents make huge sacrifices in order to get the best possible education for their children			0
privileged politicians propose to betray those parents and their values			0
but venture capitalist mr @entity9 's anger was also aimed directly at the prime minister			1
@entity6 was accused last night of giving up on plans to reform unfair dismissal laws by the author of an official report on boosting jobs and growth			0
@entity24 doctored it , it has been claimed , with eight pages of the original ' independent ' document removed or tampered with			0
it came at a time when the prime minister was forced to apologise for aiming sexist comments at a female mp in @entity153 including the infamous ' calm down dear ' attack , and the @entity74 feared they were alienating women voters			2
it appears the report was changed before it was sent to @entity1 's @entity158 last october , despite mr @entity6 's own advisers telling him that he was risking @entity15 's economic recovery by doing so			0
these experts said that the @entity18 's policies were too family - friendly , and this was not good for business or growth			2
today mr @entity9 suggested the prime minister was reneging on a deal to make it easier for small firms to fire failing staff			1
mr @entity9 told the @entity172 the move would make businesses more likely to take people on , and expressed frustration that the @entity177 had not been ' firmer ' in the face of @entity18 objections			2
' it 's very difficult having a coalition between a centre - right party and a party a lot of whose ideas are very left , ' said the @entity177 donor			0
' it means striking compromises , and things that a centre , middle person like me would think are good ideas just do n't happen			0
' it 's impossible to know from the outside where conservatives could be firmer and insisting on things			0
but i do think it is disappointing that they appear to have given up on unfair dismissal			0

cable ' is a socialist who found a home in the @entity20 , ' says employment reform adviser @entity9
in a *sensational* interview he claims @entity17 threatens to break up the @entity18 if he does n't get his own way
deputy prime minister also called ' communist ' for proposing universities accept state school students at lower grades than private school pupils
but @entity219 dems say @entity9 's report was ' bonkers ' and block recommendations
