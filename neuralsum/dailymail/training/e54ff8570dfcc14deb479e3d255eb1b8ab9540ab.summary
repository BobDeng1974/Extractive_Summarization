by dr @entity0 , the conversation while alien life can be seen nightly on television and in films , it has never been seen in space			1
not so much as a microbe , dead or alive , let alone a wrinkle - faced @entity8			2
despite this lack of protoplasmic presence , there are many researchers – sober , sceptical academics – who think that life beyond @entity15 is rampant			1
while alien life on planets has been shown by artists ( such as in this illustration ) it has never been seen in space			1
but there are many sober , sceptical academics who think that life beyond @entity15 is rampant they suggest proof may come within a generation			1
these scientists support their sunny point of view with a few astronomical facts that were unknown a generation ago			2
in particular , and thanks largely to the success of @entity37 's kepler space telescope , we can now safely claim that the universe is stuffed with temperate worlds			1
in the past two decades , thousands of planets have been discovered around other stars			1
new ones are turning up at the rate of at least one a day			0
more impressive than the tally is their sheer abundance			0
it seems the majority of stars have planets , implying the existence of a trillion of these small bodies in the @entity54 galaxy alone			1
this is the proposed @entity56 mission called @entity57 , which is comprised of small telescopes			0
its jobs is to find all , or very nearly , of the transiting exoplanets around the sky 's brightest stars a deeper analysis of @entity66 data suggests that as many as one in five stars could sport a special kind of planet , one that is the same size as @entity15 and with similar average temperatures			1
40 billion worlds in our galaxy could host alien life , according to a recent study			1
and @entity37 claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years , with a high chance it will be outside our solar system			1
during a public talk last month in @entity82 , the space agency outlined a roadmap to search for life in the universe using a number of current and future telescopes			1
do we believe there is life beyond @entity15 ? ' said former astronaut and @entity37 administrator @entity90			1
' i would venture to say that most of my colleagues here today say it is improbable that in the limitless vastness of the universe we humans stand alone			0
' such planets , styled as ' habitable ' , could be swathed by atmospheres and awash in liquid water			1
in other words , the @entity54 could be host to tens of billions of @entity15 's cousins			0
it is hard to accept that all these worlds are sterile , a circumstance that would make us , and all the flora and fauna of our planet , a miracle			0
miracles have little status in science			0
of course , just because there is a lot of attractive , cosmic real estate does n't mean finding inhabitants would be easy			2
there are only three ways to do that , and they all depend on sophisticated and expensive experiments			1
first , we could find life nearby			2
there is real effort to do that , particularly in our reconnaissance of @entity130			2
so far , most of the search has been indirect : deploying rovers whose job is to locate the best places to dig into the red planet , and possibly uncover either fossilised or extant microbes beneath the sterile surface			0
these are not attempts to find life			2
they are attempts to find places where life could be found			2
progress is deliberate , and it is sluggish			0
without doubt , @entity130 remains the favourite bet for biology			0
nonetheless , some experts prefer to wager on the moons of @entity153 and @entity154			0
we could find alien life , but politicians do n't have the will , according to @entity159 's @entity0 ( pictured ) at least five of these satellites seem to be home to some sloshy environments – mostly liquid water , although in the case of @entity166 , natural gas			1
again , the type of life that could best thrive on these moons would be microscopic			2
sensing its presence might be accomplished in several ways , ranging from simple flyby missions that nab effluvia from natural geysers , to sending elaborate drilling rigs to penetrate the ten miles of ice that separate the surface of @entity154 's @entity181 from the mammoth seas that lie below			0
sadly much of this reconnaissance hardware is still on the drawing boards , not in space			1
progress is slow , mostly because funding is low			0
a second scheme for sniffing out evidence of biology is to assay the atmospheres of planets around other stars			2
this is done using a time - honoured technique of astronomy , spectroscopy – an approach that would allow researchers to learn the composition of an atmosphere at many light - years ' distance			0
while an experiment to find oxygen or methane in someone else 's air is straightforward to describe , it is hard to do			0
that is because planets are dim , and the stars they orbit are bright			2
this @entity37 graphic shows how the number of confirmed planets has dramatically increased since the launch of @entity66 in 2009 and its subsequent studies of distant stars 40 billion worlds in our galaxy could host alien life , according to a recent study			1
and @entity37 claims that we will be able to find that life within the next 20 years , with a high chance it will be outside our solar system various solutions to this problem have been imagined , including multi-element , orbiting telescopes and giant light blockers , or occulters , in space			1
it is rocket science , but it is not as hard as curing the common cold			0
engineers could build this stuff within a dozen years , but only if they had the money			0
the third approach to finding biology beyond @entity15 is looking beyond microbes for intelligent life by eavesdropping on radio signals or flashing laser lights			1
more antennae and better receivers could speed up this search , but once again , funding is the limiting factor			0
president @entity252 announced that the proposed 2015 @entity37 budget has about $ 2.5 billion ( £ 1.5 billion ) for planetary science , astrophysics and continued work on the new @entity258 space telescope for perspective , consider that the proposed 2015 @entity37 budget has about $ 2.5 billion ( £ 1.5 billion ) for planetary science , astrophysics and continued work on the new @entity258 space telescope – categories that encompass all the planetary searches described above and more			1
that is considerably less than one - thousandth of the total @entity266 federal budget			0
the budgets for @entity159 , which takes the third approach , are a thousand times less			0
so it boils down to this : we do n't know for certain that there is life in space , but the circumstances of the universe certainly suggest that this is a plausible idea			1
finding it would be extraordinarily exciting , but because the payoff is uncertain , the investments in searching have been modest			2
of course , if you do n't ante up , you will never win the jackpot			0
and that is a question of will			0

this is according to @entity0 , a senior astronomer at @entity287
data suggests our galaxy has 40 billion planets with potential for life
but finding these depends on sophisticated and expensive experiments
