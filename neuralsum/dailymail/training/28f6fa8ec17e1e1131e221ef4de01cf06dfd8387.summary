by @entity0 published : 05:01 est , 30 july 2012 updated : 11:54 est , 30 july 2012 @entity2 reserved for @entity4 athletes and @entity5 have been turned off in some parts of @entity7 because officials have chosen to use public transport instead , @entity1 said today			1
the mayor of @entity7 made the announcement on the day the city 's transport network faced its biggest test of the @entity4 so far as @entity4 spectators and rush - hour commuters travelled together for the first time			1
he said he was pleased with the way transport systems such as the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) and the @entity21 ( @entity22 ) , were operating as commuters ' worst fears of disruption and congestion failed to materialise			2
' everybody at @entity38 was working well , the @entity36 is working well , the @entity21			1
' actually , we ’ve been able to turn off a lot of the @entity4 lanes because so many people are going by public transport			1
' it turns out a lot of the @entity4 bureaucrat types who could go in the @entity4 lanes - the " @entity49 people " as they ’re called - are using public transport			1
' @entity51 himself ( the president of the @entity53 ) today took the @entity20 , i ’m proud to say , and was conveyed in stately style and comfort he ’d expect on the @entity20 , and a lot of them are doing that and that is good news			0
' traffic was heavy on many of @entity7 's roads today , but experts said there were fewer problems than had been feared before the @entity4 got under way			1
business leaders suggested that many employees may have decided to work from home to avoid the crowds of @entity4 spectators			1
content : the mayor of @entity7 , @entity1 , said he was pleased with the way the capital 's transport network was operating @entity78 , head of employment and employee relations at the @entity81 ( @entity81 ) , said : ' it is a little early to draw defintive conclusions after one commuting session and one would n't want to say categorically that this is the way it will be for the next few weeks			1
' flexible working will have played a significant role			0
it is now an accepted part of working culture and both employees and employers are very used to the concept			0
' people have been taking that into account in their planning on how to manage through the @entity4			2
' mr @entity78 dismissed suggestions that a company 's productivity could be hampered by having more staff working from home			2
he said : ' the question is , are people able to get the work done ? ' if a business and its staff are more likely to get work done by staying at home rather than battling on through on what could have been a very hot and sticky transport system , there is no reason why working from home has any impact on productivity whatsoever			1
' mr @entity78 added that more workers may have decided to take holiday during the @entity4 , reducing the number of commuters on the roads			2
' people may be taking holiday to attend the @entity4 or watch them on television , ' he said			2
' of course , there are people who could think of nothing worse and they may have decided to leave @entity7 during the @entity4			1
' and there may be people who have gone overseas because they are yet to see a @entity132 summer and they are looking for some sunshine			0
' a spokesman for @entity135 said the number of employees working from home had probably helped traffic move more smoothly than expected			1
she also suggested that publicity campaigns , arranged by @entity141 ( @entity142 ) and @entity143 organisers @entity144 , encouraging workers to leave their cars at home also had an effect			0
motorists on the @entity150 - a major route into the capital - had their journeys disrupted this morning when a serious accident forced the closure of a section of the motorway			0
highways workers closed the @entity7 - bound carriageway between junction 5 at @entity161 in @entity162 and junction 4b near @entity164			2
long queues built up on the motorway , which has a @entity4 lane reserved for @entity4 athletes and @entity5 on the approach to west @entity7			1
some roads with @entity4 lanes in the capital itself also saw heavy traffic , such as the @entity175 and @entity176 in west @entity7 and the @entity177 in east @entity7			1
previous restrictions : some of the lanes , which were reserved for members of the ' olympic family ' , have been opened to all traffic data collected at the @entity184 control centre , which monitors traffic levels , showed vehicles were moving slowly on many routes into @entity7			1
roads into @entity7 , where the @entity189 is located at @entity190 , were among the busiest			2
half of employers have indicated that they will let their staff work from home during the @entity4 , a survey for the @entity81 has found			2
fifty - seven per cent of firms said they would adapt their employees ' hours during the @entity4 and 46 per cent said they would let their workforce time off to attend events			2
the survey found that 76 per cent of companies believe the @entity4 will boost tourism and 64 per cent expect to see trading either improve or remain the same			0
but , when asked a month ago , only 43 per cent of businesses said they had been given sufficient information about the @entity21			0
a spokesman at the control centre said : ' there have been some problems on @entity212 with congestion and there is very heavy traffic around the @entity217 area			0
' there are also some delays on the @entity220 in the @entity222 area , but we can not be sure that this is much different to how traffic levels normally are in that area on a monday morning			0
' traffic is quite heavy on the @entity227 at @entity228 , going towards @entity190 , and also on the @entity227			0
' the closed section of the @entity150 was reopened later in the morning , but there were delays of up to an hour for @entity7 - bound drivers			0
there were also hold - ups westbound on the @entity150 between @entity235 and @entity236 - a stretch of motorway close to @entity239 in @entity162 where the @entity4 rowing events are taking place			0
also in this area of @entity162 , a lineside equipment problem at @entity244 led to mid-morning delays to @entity247 rail services between @entity248 and @entity244			0
a spokesman for the @entity250 said : ' there were multiple vehicles involved in the collision on the @entity150 , which happened at about 8.25am			0
' the road was fully closed at first , but two lanes were open just after 9am			0
' with the exception of the @entity150 , there have been no reported incidents on any scale and traffic has actually flowed quite well			0
' busy : traffic builds on the @entity262 in central @entity7 on the first day that rush - hour commuters travelled into @entity7 with @entity4 spectators @entity36 and main line rail services operated well on the whole during the morning peak period , although passengers faced delays of up to 20 minutes at @entity270 because of a broken - down train			1
a @entity272 ( @entity142 ) spokesman said : ' so far this morning the public transport system and @entity7 ’s roads are working well as commuters travel to work and spectators travel to the @entity4 venues			1
' we are closely monitoring the transport network , which will be exceptionally busy this week			1
' today @entity38 , the @entity20 , @entity281 and @entity282 will exceptionally busy			1
' our advice to passengers will be different every day so plan ahead at @entity285 to avoid disruption and delay to your journey and to make the most of all the @entity4 have to offer			0
' @entity38 station was expected to be very busy this evening with spectators travelling to the equestrian cross country event at @entity293 in south east @entity7			1
a part of @entity38 is being closed to departing passengers from 6pm to 10pm to minimise congestion			0
those affected are passengers travelling on services bound for @entity299 , @entity300 and @entity301 run by the @entity303 and @entity304 train companies			0
@entity142 said @entity4 events meant the @entity20 would be particularly busy today as would @entity281 and @entity36 stations			2
the @entity307 and @entity308 said main line train companies had provided 565,276 extra seats today , operating nearly 4.16million seats in total			0
hundreds of staff from transport companies were working at @entity38 station , they said			1
as of noon today , 93 per cent of services were running to schedule across the network , with services operating normally in and out of @entity270 again after the earlier disruption			0
key route : motorists faced disruption on the @entity323 , which has a dedicated @entity4 lane ( right ) on its approach to west @entity7			1
