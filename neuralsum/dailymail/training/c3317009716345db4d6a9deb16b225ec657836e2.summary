@entity0 of @entity1 , @entity3 's @entity2 , will take charge of @entity6 financial services regulation @entity7 secured a rare victory in @entity9 today after @entity3 ’s @entity11 commissioner was given a top finance job			1
the @entity13 had been bracing himself for a fresh snub , amid suggestions that former @entity17 leader @entity16 would be handed a junior role in the @entity19			1
but the @entity19 president @entity20 this morning announced that @entity21 would be given a new ‘ @entity26 ’ portfolio – giving him key powers to protect the @entity24 from @entity11 regulations			1
the @entity28 peer was put forward by the prime minister to serve on mr @entity20 's new @entity19 earlier this summer			1
but it was feared @entity3 would miss out on an economic role because the commission president - whose appointment was fiercely resisted by mr @entity7 - had indicated he wanted a woman to be @entity3 's top representative in @entity11			0
mr @entity20 , announcing his @entity19 team this morning , said : " in these unprecedented times , @entity9 's citizens expect us to deliver			1
‘ after years of economic hardship and often painful reforms , @entity9 expect a performing economy , sustainable jobs , more social protection , safer borders , energy security and digital opportunities			0
‘ today i am presenting the team that will put @entity9 back on the path to jobs and growth			0
’ the new ‘ @entity53 , @entity26 and @entity54 ’ portfolio run by @entity21 will be in charge of introducing new regulation for @entity9 banks			1
ministers will hope to use lord @entity16 ’s influence in @entity11 to limit the amount of @entity6 regulation over @entity3 ’s financial services industry			1
mr @entity20 wrote to @entity21 to announce his new position			2
he said : ' you are becoming a member of the new @entity19 at a particularly challenging time for the @entity6			2
' with the start of the new commission , we have an exceptional opportunity , but also an obligation , to make a fresh start , to address the difficult geo - political situation , to strengthen economic recovery and to build a @entity9 that delivers jobs and growth for its citizens			0
' i want the new @entity19 to be a strong and political team			2
and i want you , with your political skills and experience , to fully play your part in this team			0
’ he added : ' following our recent discussions , i would like you to be the @entity87 , @entity26 and @entity54			0
' in this mission letter , i set out what i expect from you as a member of the @entity19 as well as specific goals for which you will be responsible for reaching during our mandate			0
' @entity19 president @entity20 received @entity7 at the @entity94 in @entity11 , @entity95 , with a high five in july - despite the pm trying to block him getting the job chancellor @entity98 claimed lord @entity16 's appointment was ' great news ' for @entity3			1
he wrote on @entity101 : ‘ look forward to working with @entity21 , @entity6 financial services commissioner , to build safer & more competitive sector			1
’ @entity104 also welcomed the announcement			0
the pm 's spokesman said : ‘ we welcome president - designate @entity20 's announcement of the new @entity19 - designate			1
‘ we have made the case for an economic portfolio for @entity21 and i think that is what we have seen in today 's announcement			2
‘ what we see here - unlike in the previous @entity19 - is a stand - alone financial services portfolio that also brings with it elements of financial stability that were previously in another portfolio			1
it will be this portfolio that is looking at financial services issues in the single market , but also issues such as banking union , which have always been thought of as having particular relevance to the eurozone			1
‘ we are seeing that being led by a commissioner from a non-euro member - state			0
i think that speaks to the point that the prime minister and others have been making about the importance , as we go ahead with reform of the @entity6 , of ensuring that the voice of countries that are not in euro and will not join the euro - such as the @entity3 - are fully represented			0
’ but @entity137 leader @entity136 said : ‘ what a coup for @entity20 - he has got an @entity140 to be hangman for the @entity3 financial industry , a huge contributor to our national tax revenue			2
‘ mr @entity7 transferred control of @entity3 's financial services industry - our biggest industry - to the @entity6 in 2010			2
that process has now been completed by the appointment of a @entity3 commissioner to make sure that everything is done on an @entity6 level			0
‘ it is vital to note that @entity21 will not be acting in the interests of the @entity3 government or the @entity3 people ; he will be making a solemn pledge to act in the interests of the @entity6			0

lord @entity16 handed *crucial* ' @entity26 ' portfolio in @entity19
former leader of the @entity17 will be in charge of financial services regulation
