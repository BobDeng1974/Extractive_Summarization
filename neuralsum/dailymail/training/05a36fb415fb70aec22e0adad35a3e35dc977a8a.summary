when @entity1 host @entity2 in the month of november , tradition dictates that fireworks are always likely			1
@entity5 ’s seven - match ban for racially abusing @entity6 has the potential to make the meeting of the clubs at @entity10 a week on sunday downright incendiary			1
when the teams last met in september , @entity5 clashed with @entity6 in the 55th minute of play			1
only two men know what really happened but the @entity1 defender accused his opponent of saying ‘ get your hands off me , you black c * * * ’			1
@entity5 ( centre ) has been found guilty of using racist language towards @entity6 ( right ) @entity5 has always maintained that @entity6 misheard him			1
indeed , speaking when on international duty with @entity24 this month , he insisted : ‘ the racism case against me is now closed			2
‘ @entity2 had four videos of the incident which proved there was no racial slur			1
’ yet there appears to be no video evidence to support @entity5 ’s claim			1
and the @entity33 were moved to deny the case had been settled			2
@entity36 ’s disciplinary tribunal sat for four hours yesterday hearing evidence from both sides before handing @entity5 a seven - game suspension which , if upheld , will keep the player on the sidelines until the @entity42			1
such an absence from the game may be the least of his worries			2
to say the verdict , @entity2 ’s subsequent appeal not withstanding , places @entity5 ’s career on the line is hardly an exaggeration			1
@entity6 is an honest , intelligent footballer			1
it ’s difficult to imagine him fabricating such a serious accusation , knowing the impact it would have on the reputation of an opponent			2
after clashing with @entity5 , he was so incensed he ran towards referee @entity59 before relaying the accusation to his captain @entity61			1
@entity2 have backed @entity5 and deny that he is a racist , despite the outcome of the disciplinary hearning when @entity1 scored , late in the game , he utilised the break in play to repeat his claim to manager @entity68 , who gave evidence to the @entity36 hearing yesterday			1
bluntly , @entity2 believe the evidence presented by @entity1 was flimsy			1
there were no third - party corroborating witnesses			2
it was , in essence , one man ’s word against another			0
under questioning , @entity5 told @entity2 officials @entity6 had ‘ misheard ’ what he actually said			1
there was no smoking gun for the governing body to study			0
no microphone recording or cctv images a lip - reader might analyse closely			0
@entity1 quite simply presented the more credible witnesses and the decision was made on the ‘ balance of probabilities ’			1
can of worms barely covers it			0
last night , @entity2 manager @entity95 maintained @entity5 ’s innocence			1
as a club , the @entity98 champions have resolved to stand by their player and will appeal within five days of being formally notified of the decision			1
reiterating a previous stance , the @entity102 insisted : ‘ i ’m sure that he ( @entity5 ) has n’t said that towards the player			1
‘ it ’s important to understand that people make mistakes			0
‘ everyone makes mistakes – i ’m now talking generally			0
we have to assess it from there			0
‘ of course we have no support for racism – that ’s clear			0
we will have nothing about that			0
‘ but sometimes as a young player , stupid things happen all the time with smaller issues			0
‘ this is something we will need to assess but i really believe in him			0
’ within @entity2 , he is not alone			1
the @entity125 club carried out their own internal investigation , interviewing @entity5 and , privately , senior figures at the club express astonishment at the @entity33 ’s decision			1
@entity5 ’s parent club @entity131 have been reported as being ready to use the verdict to rip up the winger ’s contract			1
yet when @entity2 contacted @entity131 figures , including manager @entity137 for background statements on @entity139 , there was consensus that the allegations were far out of character			1
@entity2 assistant manager @entity143 accompanied the @entity145 midfielder to his hearing on thursday last night all @entity131 would say was that they ‘ will make no further comment while an ongoing process remains in place ’			1
as @entity2 begin their appeal , the search for a precedent leads obviously to the @entity155 - @entity154 incident back in 2011			1
as a @entity157 player , @entity154 accused the former @entity159 striker of racist abuse			0
@entity155 was charged with ‘ abusive and / or insulting words and / or behaviour contrary to @entity164 rules ’			0
the comparisons between that case and this are obvious			0
like @entity5 , there was no substantial , irrefutable evidence the @entity170 had , as suggested , branded the @entity171 a ‘ negro ’ five times			1
when the @entity164 issued a 115 - page verdict , they conceded @entity154 had simply been the more believable witness , with the testimony of @entity155 considered dodgy and inconsistent with video pictures			2
like @entity2 , @entity159 were irate			2
at the time they said : ‘ we find it extraordinary that @entity155 can be found guilty on the word of @entity154 alone when no one else on the field of play – including @entity154 ’s own @entity157 team - mates and match officials – heard the alleged conversation			0
’ that argument held little weight			0
@entity155 was handed an eight - match ban and a £ 40,000 fine			0
at the moment we are operating very much in the dark			0
the written reasons for the @entity33 ’s decision might have been released next week but will now be delayed pending the @entity2 appeal			1
the @entity125 club will call on some heavy duty , expensive legal assistance in an effort to commute the suspension completely			2
reducing the ban to three games is not an option			0
@entity5 either made racist remarks or he did n’t			2
@entity143 and @entity5 leave @entity36 after hearing the result , but the club have insisted they will appeal neither is it clear when an appeal will be held			1
with @entity2 in @entity213 duty in @entity214 next week , it seems unlikely a panel can be convened before the champions visit @entity10 a week on sunday			2
an @entity218 encounter as raw and unpleasant as the increasingly messy , tangled legal wrangle enveloping @entity220 already looks more likely than not			0
@entity95 is maintaining his defence of the former @entity223 player			0
‘ he ’s never shown a bad attitude here , ’ the @entity2 boss added yesterday			2
‘ he ’s a calm , nice boy and he just needs confidence			0
‘ he ’s an athlete and we have to work on his choices and decision - making			2
but as a professional , i have nothing bad to say about him			0
‘ he has to work hard every day to improve			0
he was out for a long time before he came here and his confidence was not the best			0
‘ we must work every day to get that feeling we have with @entity237 and all the others			0
‘ we have to work all the time on getting to know each other and doing the best thing for every player			0
’ @entity95 may well be right that @entity5 is a ‘ nice boy ’			2
rarely , however , has that been a suitable defence .			0

@entity5 denies calling @entity6 ' a black c * * * '
@entity2 will appeal the decision once they receive written verdict
club believe the evidence presented by @entity1 was flimsy
