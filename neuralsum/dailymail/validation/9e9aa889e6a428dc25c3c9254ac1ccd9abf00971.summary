@entity0 always knew that @entity1 would turn things around after a difficult start to their @entity5 campaign and has cited manager @entity6 as the reason			1
despite coming within two points of winning the title last season , the @entity8 initially struggled this term after losing @entity13 and bringing in a raft of new signings - losing four of their opening five league games			2
however , @entity1 have been the form team of 2015 , winning seven and drawing two of their league games to challenge for a @entity22 place while reaching the quarter - finals of the @entity24			1
@entity0 ( left ) trains ahead of @entity1 's @entity24 quarter - final clash with @entity26 on sunday the defender insists he always knew @entity6 would come good for @entity1 this season @entity0 has hailed ' intelligent ' @entity6 for making @entity1 the @entity5 form team of 2015 speaking to @entity29 , @entity0 said : i 'm not surprised by the turn around because the manager is great , really intelligent in working out problems			1
' he pays attention to every detail , tries different things , pushes players so you do n't get lazy			2
we had a lot of new players coming in , especially young ones from abroad who had to settle in			0
' i moved to @entity44 when i was 21 so i know it takes time to fit in , to learn			0
i knew that eventually it would all come together , and that is what the boss kept telling us as well			0
' @entity1 face @entity26 on sunday for a chance of boosting their season even further by reaching the @entity24 semi-finals @entity0 , who has returned from winning the @entity55 with the @entity56 , could become the first player in history to win the @entity24 with three different clubs , having already collected the trophy with @entity61 ( 2003 , 2005 ) and @entity62 ( 2011 )			1
@entity0 could become the first player to win the @entity24 with three clubs , having won it with @entity61 ( above ) and @entity62 previously the 33 - year - old celebrates winning the @entity55 with the @entity56 in february although the 33 - year - old has been used as a substitute in @entity1 's last two games , he understands that he is not guaranteed playing time at @entity68			1
' when you 're with a big team like @entity1 , you ca n't expect to start every game , especially because i was a way with the @entity56 for almost a month			2
' but i am always ready to contribute whether it is on the pitch or in the dressing room			0
we have a team that 's hungry for success , with exciting young players that i help guide with experience			0
the winning mentality is really , really strong			0
