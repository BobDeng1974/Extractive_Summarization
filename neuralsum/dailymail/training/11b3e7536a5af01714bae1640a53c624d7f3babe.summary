winter is a little less than a month away but ice is forming on three of @entity4 's @entity3 , the earliest it has in at least 40 years			2
while @entity4 's monumental waters do n't normally begin freezing over until the middle of december , three of @entity4 's @entity3 have already begun forming ice , according to a report by the @entity10			1
by november 20 @entity11 and @entity12 were half a per cent covered in ice and @entity14 was one per cent covered in ice			1
@entity31 still shows no signs of icing over			0
@entity33 reports that coverage of early freezing dates back to 1973 but that last friday was the earliest that all three @entity3 began to show signs of ice for at least four decades			1
@entity38 reports that last winter ’s cold temperatures , a cooler than normal summer , and a blast of arctic air allowed for the ice to form on the lakes early for the second year in a row			0
last winter ’s frigid temperatures lead to the second highest ice coverage for the @entity3 as a whole			0
@entity12 was also covered in ice for the longest time it ever has been and last year showed the second largest ever ice coverage			2
in 2013 , ice appeared on the lake on november 25 and did n't melt until june of 2014 meaning @entity12 only went five and a half months without any ice on the water			1
@entity57 , @entity4 and @entity14 showed ice 10 days earlier this year than last year			0
temperatures over the next few months will determine whether or not the lakes will remain frozen for as long as they did last year			0
@entity38 reports that the next few days show lower than normal temperatures in the @entity63 which will only contribute more to the ice			0
ice forming : as of november 20 @entity11 , @entity12 , and @entity14 already showed signs of ice formation almost a month before usual beginning to glaciate : by november 20 @entity11 and @entity12 ( pictured ) were half a per cent covered in ice and @entity14 was one per cent covered in ice record freezing : ice is already starting to develop on @entity4 's @entity3 and this is the earliest ice on some of the @entity3 in at least 40 years record ice coverage : @entity12 was covered in ice for the longest time it ever has been and last year showed the second largest ever ice coverage and has been ice free for just five and a half months			1

by november 20 @entity11 and @entity12 were half a per cent covered in ice and @entity14 was one per cent covered in ice
@entity12 was the first lake to show signs of hardening and began freezing on november 15
the @entity3 typically do n't begin freezing over until the beginning or middle of december
