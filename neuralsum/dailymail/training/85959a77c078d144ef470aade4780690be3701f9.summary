by @entity0 and @entity1 up to 100 @entity3 mps are set to defy @entity4 by pledging to vote to leave the @entity5 no matter how much power he manages to claw back from @entity8			1
conservative eurosceptics are planning to promise in their personal manifestos for next may ’s general election that they will vote for @entity12 to quit the @entity5 in 2017 ’s in / out referendum			1
such a move would be widely seen as a vote of no confidence in the prime minister ’s ability to win a good deal for @entity12			0
@entity20 ( right with @entity21 ) appears to be in line for a historic win in @entity24 , where he sits as @entity3 mp and it would echo the warning by @entity20 , the former @entity3 mp who defected to @entity29 last week , that mr @entity4 was not ‘ serious ’ about @entity5 reform and wanted to recommend an ‘ in ’ vote			1
the newly elected president of the @entity33 , @entity34 prime minister @entity32 , said at the weekend that he would support key reforms demanded by mr @entity4 , including a crackdown on benefit tourism			0
but that would not be enough for the 50 to 100 @entity3 mps planning to bring out the rebellious manifestos , according to @entity39 speaking to the @entity41			2
@entity42 , mp for @entity43 and @entity44 , said : ‘ my election manifesto will confirm my view that we should leave the @entity5			2
’ meanwhile , a senior @entity3 says the party should not even try to contest the seat where @entity20 is standing next month			1
@entity50 , the former deputy speaker , yesterday urged his party to ‘ sit out ’ the by - election in @entity24 where the former @entity3 mp , will now run for @entity29			1
it comes as up to three leading @entity54 are reported to have started private talks about ‘ non-aggression pacts ’ in which @entity29 would not run against them			2
the by - election , which a poll this weekend suggests mr @entity20 will win by a landslide , presents a severe dilemma for the conservatives			1
ploughing resources into keeping the seat would be expensive and some fear it would divert resources from other key seats to what could be a high - profile failure			0
mr @entity50 , who described himself as ‘ sort of ’ a friend of mr @entity20 , told @entity72 : ‘ a part of me says we should sit this one out , it ’s a total distraction			0
’ @entity77 ( left ) , a former @entity3 chairman who used to organise by - election campaigning , said it was his party ’s ‘ duty ’ to fight every by - election seriously ; @entity50 ( right ) , the former deputy speaker , yesterday urged his party to ‘ sit out ’ the by - election in @entity24 he added : ‘ i spent the day yesterday with 250 young @entity83 who feel desperately let down by @entity20			1
they do believe the only way we ’re going to make headway is by having a referendum on @entity90			0
‘ how are we going to do that ? with the @entity83 and @entity4 winning in 2015			0
it really makes no sense to me at all			0
’ but @entity77 , a former @entity3 chairman who used to organise by - election campaigning , said it was his party ’s ‘ duty ’ to fight every by - election seriously			1
he proposed deals between the conservatives and @entity29 two years ago , but said the idea was no longer viable as many of @entity29 ’s policies , such as cuts to the @entity105 budget , ‘ contradicted ’ conservative policies			0
he said : ‘ we ca n’t say we are not going to fight it			0
we have to fight every by - election seriously			2
conservative voters in @entity24 will expect a serious campaign and we can not disenfranchise them			0
’ it was claimed yesterday that mps who want to cut ties with @entity8 but are not prepared to join @entity29 will defy mr @entity4 by forming their own ‘ non-aggression pacts ’ with the party			2
this could involve stripping their campaign literature of @entity3 logos and using quotes from mr @entity21 on pamphlets — effectively running as joint candidates , the @entity116 said .			1

scores of mps to promise to vote to leave @entity5 in future referendum
comes after @entity20 defected to @entity29 and *criticised* *pm*
top @entity3 @entity77 urges party to fight by - election ' seriously '
three ' @entity135 ' @entity83 have begun talks with @entity29 , it is reported
some @entity83 could campaign using quotes from @entity21 on election literature and *remove* all @entity3 logos
