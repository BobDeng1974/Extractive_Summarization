by @entity0 the @entity2 quarter - final and semi-final in 2006 were two of the biggest games of my career			1
i loved performing on the biggest stage as i knew i was a better goalkeeper under pressure			2
they are the matches when you know you have to deliver ; that you must not fail			2
that is the case for @entity14 ’s @entity13 and @entity16 ’s @entity15 on friday night			1
they , like me , will probably be nervous before the game but then the whistle blows and it is back to delivering			0
it ’s a bigger challenge for @entity13 than @entity15 , as he has played fewer high - level games but the battle will be fascinating			1
i ’ll be supporting @entity16 , of course , but i have taken emotion out of it for this critical assessment of the two players			1
scroll down to see @entity15 highlights for @entity16 @entity29 : goalkeepers @entity13 and @entity15 go hjead - to - head on friday night penalty heroics : @entity0 helped @entity16 to the @entity2 semi-finals on home soil in 2006 mental strength @entity13 : he still has to prove his mental strength			1
with @entity39 , every time when it mattered , the team did n’t perform			1
and he has n’t had many big challenges yet for @entity14			1
but one big performance in a big game can make you a different player			0
you learn so much in these matches			2
@entity47 : he ’s mentally very strong because he ’s been successful for such a big club in @entity50			0
you saw that in the @entity52 game , where he came out of his box so many times			0
his timing was perfect and it shows real mental strength to act rather than react			0
something to prove : @entity13 is yet to face a big challenge so far at this summer 's tournament in @entity59 shot stopping @entity13 : he is very good and agile			1
the only thing that worries me is that his arms are skinny , like a lot of keepers these days			0
that has changed from my day and not for the better			0
@entity47 : he has better , stronger arms			0
it can be the difference between clawing a ball off the line or it going in			0
the stronger your arms , the more likely you are to save powerful shots			0
brick wall : @entity15 has strong arms making it more likely for him to save powerful shots at goal distribution @entity13 : he is left - footed and distributes well			1
he is very precise and better with that foot that @entity15 is with either of his			1
@entity47 : the @entity84 ’s huge advantage is that he kicks with both feet and his distribution from his hands is the best in the world			2
go long ! @entity15 is capable of using both feet while @entity13 is particularly precise with his left foot presence in the area @entity13 : he ’s 6ft 2in but because he is skinny , he does not have a great presence			1
you often have to decide at the last second whether to punch or catch the ball but you need strong arms to be able to punch with both			0
@entity47 : he could come more often for crosses because his huge frame makes him a big presence and he can dominate			2
flying high : @entity13 climbs highest to punch the ball clear during @entity14 's last - 16 victory over @entity107 @entity108 @entity13 : i can rarely remember a shorter goalkeeper winning a shootout against a taller one			1
and of his 22 penalties faced in the past few years , he has saved only two			0
i won a shootout against @entity114 in 2006 and two things were vital : the information i had on my opponents ’ habits and timing my jump in the split second when it was obvious the taker could no longer change direction			0
@entity47 : he lost the @entity126 final against @entity127 - @entity84 are not supposed to lose penalty shootouts , i can say that as a @entity84 ! but his armspan covers almost two thirds of the goal and he has saved 33 per cent of kicks since 2009 success : @entity127 may have got the better of @entity15 but the @entity84 has saved 33 per cent of kicks since 2009 @entity135 @entity13 : he is very quick off his line			1
he gets down to balls quickly because he ’s not that tall and is very agile			0
when i failed to make a save , i used to wish i was smaller but i was wrong - making saves is just a small part of what you have to do as a keeper			2
@entity47 : showed against @entity52 what he can do and has proved it again and again at a high level			2
sweeper keeper : @entity15 had to come to the aid of his back four during @entity16 's extra-time win over @entity52 verdict @entity13 wants to play at the top level , @entity15 already does			1
this match - up is a man who is good against a man who is top - class			0
