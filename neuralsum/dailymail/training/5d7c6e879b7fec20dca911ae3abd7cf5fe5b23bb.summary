by @entity1 reporter last updated at 3:42 pm on 14th december 2011 a woman on kidney dialysis has risked her life to give birth to a healthy baby girl			1
doctors usually advise women not to try for a child if they are suffering from kidney failure as only a handful of @entity13 women on dialysis have ever successfully had a child			1
however @entity16 , 28 , was determined to try even though she had already lost one baby at 24 weeks			1
baby joy : @entity19 with partner @entity16 who gave birth to @entity21 after being on kidney dialysis at @entity24 's women 's hospital she successfully gave birth to a premature @entity26 at @entity27 three weeks ago			1
ms @entity16 from @entity28 , @entity29 , is on the organ transplant list after being diagnosed with a rare condition kidney disorder called cystinosis at the age of three			1
she went through six hours of dialysis for six days a week throughout her pregnancy , to give her baby the best possible chance of survival			1
@entity26 was delivered safely by caesarean section after ms @entity16 had a massive bleed at 30 weeks and four days			1
the baby weighed 3lbs 10oz and is said to be doing well in the hospital 's neonatal care unit			2
@entity45 is a rare inherited condition in which an amino acid called cystine accumulates in the body 's cells			2
this can cause damage to organs especially the kidneys and eyes			0
ms @entity16 has infantile cystinosis with symptoms appearing early in childhood			1
symptoms include an excessive thirst , poor appetite and rickets			0
these symptoms are caused by damage to two parts of the kidneys ' filtering units			0
without urgent treatment , the kidneys eventually fail and the child needs dialysis or a transplant			2
the condition can also develop in the early teens and symptoms are often milder			0
there is around one case in every 200,000 live births in developed countries			0
it two parents carry the defective cystinosis gene their child has a one in four chance of developing the condition			0
ms @entity16 and her partner , @entity85 , 25 , said the birth would never have been possible but for the skill and dedication of teams at @entity24 women 's and the @entity91 of the @entity92 and @entity93			1
' they were all so amazing and so caring			0
@entity26 is only here because of them , ' she said			0
' i always thought i 'd never be a mum			0
when i got pregnant and i told the doctors , i knew the risks that i could lose another child , but i wanted to go through with it because if i did n't then i 'd never know			0
' a successful pregnancy in women treated with renal dialysis is rare			1
there had only been 90 pregnancies world - wide in 10 years with a success rate of between 50 and 75 per cent			2
@entity16 's obstetrician praised her determination in deciding to try for a child			2
@entity110 , consultant in maternity and fetal medicine at @entity27 : ' i have never come across one before during my experience			0
she is a very brave woman			0
' @entity24 women 's and the @entity92 and @entity93 hospitals established a combined obstetric renal clinic some years ago to co-ordinate the care of these and other women with complex kidney problems			2
the pregnancy was ms @entity16 's second , after she became pregnant in 2004 but went into premature labour at 24 weeks			1
her son , @entity123 , was born in february 2005 but only lived for 12 hours			0
@entity16 praised the staff at @entity27 who delivered her premature baby safely mr @entity110 added : ' @entity16 represented a real challenge to the team with her need for very frequent dialysis and the presence of a condition called placenta praevia which carries a risk of massive bleeding during pregnancy			1
' the combination of risks undoubtedly put @entity16 's life in danger and meant she had to spend a lot of the final weeks of her pregnancy in our hospital			1
' the successful outcome here is a testament to the care provided by a number of doctors , nurses and midwives at both hospitals and shows what can be achieved in modern maternal medicine			0
