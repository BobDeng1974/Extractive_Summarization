by @entity1 reporter published : 21:08 est , 22 november 2013 updated : 08:01 est , 23 november 2013 a @entity3 woman is furious after she claims her dog and cat were nearly killed during a cross-country @entity7 flight after baggage handlers left the animals in their crates for more than 12 hours - including more than an hour spent outside on the tarmac in 94 - degree heat			1
adding insult to injury , @entity13 claims , is the fact that the airline only agreed to pay for the animals ' veterinary bills if she signed a non-disclosure agreement promising not to discuss the incident with the media			1
@entity23 , however , did n't sign the agreement , and has since told her story to several news outlets , as well as creating a @entity28 page titled ' @entity7 almost killed my @entity29			1
' near death : when @entity34 the greyhound got off a @entity7 flight , she was nearly dead from heat stroke and other ailments tough kitty : @entity13 's cat , @entity40 , spent close to an hour on the tarmac in @entity42 in 94 - degree heat speaking out : @entity7 offered @entity23 money to pay her veterinary bills as long as she agreed not to publicly discuss the incident in july , @entity23 was moving from @entity48 to @entity3 and decided to use @entity7 ' ' @entity50 ' program to transport her cat , @entity40 and her greyhound , @entity34			1
@entity23 opted to go with the ' @entity50 ' program because it promises that pets will receive personal handling in climate controlled vans and that they ' never will be exposed to temperatures greater than 85 degrees for more than 45 minutes			2
' ' they assured me that my animals would get a safety stop – a comfort stop – in @entity42 that i paid extra for , ' @entity23 told @entity65			0
that , however , did n't happen			0
' @entity50 ' : @entity23 paid extra to make sure her pets were taken care of , but they were left on a hot tarmac for nearly an hour evidence : @entity23 recorded the poor treatment her animals received on her cellphone according to @entity23 , she watched as the plane waited on the runway at @entity80 in @entity42 and saw a cargo employee kick @entity34 's crate at least six times in an attempt to shove it under the shade of the wing of the plane			1
that 's when @entity23 pulled out her phone and started recording how cargo workers were treating her animals			2
the video @entity23 shot shows the animals being left out on the tarmac for nearly an hour			2
by the time the plane touched down in @entity3 , @entity23 says @entity34 was on the verge of death			0
' @entity34 ’s entire crate was filled with blood , feces , urine , ' @entity23 said			2
' @entity34 was in full heat stroke			0
all of the blankets were filled with blood			0
she was urinating and defecating blood			0
she was dying , literally , right in front of me			0
' heat stroke : when they landed , @entity34 's cage was covered in blood , urine and feces sick : when the plane landed , @entity34 was near death , suffering from heat stroke and other injuries non-disclosure : @entity23 declined to sign a non-disclosure agreement so she could alert the public about her experience @entity34 then spent three days in intensive care being treated for heat stroke			1
despite the fact that a veterinarian had given both animals a clean bill of health prior to the flight , @entity7 claims the dog 's injuries were the result of a pre-existing condition			1
however , the doctor who treated the greyhound wrote in his report that ' we have no reason to believe that these medical problems were due to underlying disease , and we believe that these medical problems were secondary to hyperthermia that she suffered during her @entity7 flight			0
' the airline offered to pay for the dog 's treatment , but only if @entity23 signed the agreement promising that she would not publicly discuss the incident			1
@entity7 has declined comment about the incident , but offered a written statement saying ' we are committed to ensuring safe and comfortable travel of all the pets that fly with us and regret that @entity34 did not have a good experience			1
we offered to compensate ms. @entity13 by fully reimbursing her vet bill , but unfortunately she declined to accept the terms of the agreement			1
' @entity23 says that making the public aware of the incident that nearly killed her dog is worth more than being reimbursed			2
' i still want to be reimbursed , ' she said			0
' but i ’m not going to be quiet			0
