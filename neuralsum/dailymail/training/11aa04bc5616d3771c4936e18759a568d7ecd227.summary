blooming hanging baskets , immaculately trimmed lawns and perfect topiary have long been used by rural folk to show off the best of village life			1
but while rivalries have always existed between neighbouring communities desperate to be crowned @entity10 ’s @entity9 , conservationists say increased competition for pristine parishes is brewing a far bigger wildlife scandal for the @entity10 countryside			1
they claim all untidy patches of public scrub land , which are prime habitats for insects and birds , are being cleared and made to look ‘ too neat and tidy ’ for the contests , whose rules afford few points to villages with scruffier areas that encourage wildlife to thrive			1
@entity35 conservation trust said constantly striving for neat and tidy villages could harm wildlife a touch of colour : @entity10 's @entity9 contests are arranged by regional organisers including the @entity42 , but much of the emphasis in the scoring is on things looking neat as a consequence , environmentalists say the competitions are unwittingly contributing to the decline of some species of honey bees , butterflies and birds , which were once in abundance across @entity10			1
provision for wildlife accounts for just 10 per cent of the scoring for villages entering @entity9 contests , with much more focus on the appearance and cleanliness of streets , flowerbeds and other public areas			1
campaigners say that , as a consequence , the strict rules are forcing parish councils to get rid of any slightly untidy areas of scrub land , including compost heaps and log piles , which are perfect breeding grounds and habitats for insects and birds			2
over-mown lawns and severely trimmed hedges , which are awarded more points , are also leading to the decline of common species , they say			1
the competition is run in a number of counties in @entity84 , including @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90			2
in each case it is organised by a regional group , including branches of the @entity42 ( @entity42 )			2
perfect for the birds : sparrows make themselves at home in a tangled hedgerow in a residential garden picture postcard beauty : @entity101 in @entity88 ( pictured ) has won a string of @entity9 contests @entity104 , an entomologist at the conservation trust @entity35 , said best kept village competitions often had a ‘ very old fashioned ’ approach to conservation that was ‘ unhelpful ’ in a modern world			1
he said the criteria in such contests was contradicting @entity113 efforts to halt the decline of bees and other insects			1
‘ i ’ve come across those sorts of villages , ’ he told the @entity117			2
‘ the full blown neat and tidy approach is a travesty in this day and age			1
‘ when you consider the government has introduced a national pollinator strategy why would you want @entity9 criteria that run contrary to that ? ’ fading scene : butterfly species are in decline but he admitted that conservationists needed to ‘ strike a balance ’ with organisers			2
‘ we are n’t purists , ’ mr @entity104 said			0
‘ i think most conservation organisations would say there is a lot to be said for presenting wildlife habitats nicely			1
rotting material does n’t need to be visible at all			0
you can have it in nooks and crannies			0
’ half of all bumblebee species in the @entity10 are in long term decline and seven bumblebee species have fallen in number by more than 50 per cent in the last 25 years			0
butterflies are another species also on the decline as a consequence of the destruction or poor management of their habitats , @entity151 , a spokesman for the @entity153 charity , said			0
according to the most recent figures , from 2011 , three quarters of @entity164 butterfly species decreased in abundance over the previous decade			0
both bees and butterflies are vital for pollinating crops – £ 12.6billion worth of crops ( or 84 per cent of the @entity172 total ) rely on such insects			0
‘ many familiar butterflies are now far less abundant than they were , raising concerns for the health of our environment , ’ mr @entity151 added			0
‘ caterpillars also love patches of untidy , unkempt undergrowth with long grasses and other wild plants			0
’ @entity184 , who judges the @entity9 competition for the @entity42 in @entity186 , admitted that , while wildlife provision is taken into account by some , it ought to be better reflected in the formal competition criteria			1
‘ i think things can be tweaked , ’ she said			0
‘ i would n’t be averse to within @entity85 making it more explicit because i think it is a big issue			0
’ she said the results for this year ’s contest in the county were due to be announced this week .			0

*over-trimmed* lawns and hedges are *disadvantaging* wildlife , say *experts*
@entity35 conservation trust said the contests have ' old - fashioned approach '
wildlife makes just 10 *%* of score and judges admit changes could be made
