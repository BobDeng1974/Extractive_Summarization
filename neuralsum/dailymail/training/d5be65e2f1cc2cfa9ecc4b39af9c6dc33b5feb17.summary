by @entity0 @entity2 marijuana advocates are fighting back against the @entity4 stereotypes and ominous anti-drug campaigns with a series of advertisements encouraging users to ' consumer responsibly			1
' to get their message across , they are skewering some of the old drug war - era ads that focused on the fears of marijuana , including the famous ' this is your brain on drugs ' fried - egg ad from the 1980s			2
they are planning posters , brochures , billboards and magazine ads to caution consumers to use the drug responsibly and warn tourists and first - timers about the potential to get sick from accidentally eating too much medical - grade pot. ' so far , every campaign designed to educate the public about marijuana has relied on fear - mongering and insulting marijuana users , ' said @entity35 , spokesman for the @entity36 , the nation 's biggest pot - policy advocacy group			1
fighting stereotypes : this new pro-pot billboard by the @entity36 will appear near legal pot dispensaries in @entity41 encouraging users to ' start low and go slow ' if you use marijuana : the mpp mocks anti-drug campaigns and promotes marijuana education that ' makes sense ' the mpp plans to unveil a billboard on wednesday on a west @entity41 street where many pot shops are located that shows a woman slumped in a hotel room with the tagline : ' do n't let a candy bar ruin your vacation			1
' it 's an allusion to @entity60 , a @entity61 columnist who got sick from eating one on a visit to write about pot. the campaign is a direct response to the state 's post-legalization marijuana - education efforts			1
one of them is intended to prevent stoned driving and shows men zoning out while trying to play basketball , light a grill or hang a television			0
many in the industry said the ads showed stereotypical stoners instead of average adults			0
even more concerning to activists is a youth - education campaign that relies on a human - sized cage and the message , ' do n't be a @entity84 , ' along with warnings about pot and developing brains			1
the cage in @entity41 has been repeatedly vandalized			0
at least one school district rejected the traveling exhibit , saying it was well - intentioned but inappropriate			0
' to me , that 's not really any different than @entity93 saying ' @entity94 , '' said @entity95 , co-owner of four marijuana dispensaries and a critic of the ' lab rat ' campaign , referring to the former first lady 's effort to combat drug use			2
a spokesman for the state @entity104 welcomed the industry 's ads , and defended the ' lab rat ' campaign			2
' it 's been effective in starting a conversation about potential risks to youth from marijuana , ' @entity109 said			0
up in @entity115 : activists aim to terminate stoner stereotypes made popular by the @entity4 franchise snack responsibly : the campaign often alludes to @entity60 , the @entity61 columnist who got sick after eating too much pot the dueling campaigns come at a time when the industry is concerned about inexperienced consumers using edible pot. the popularity of edibles surprised some in the industry when legal - marijuana retail sales began in january			1
edible pot products have been blamed for at least one death , of a college student who jumped to his death in @entity41 in march after consuming six times the recommended dose of edible marijuana			0
the headlines , including @entity60 's experience , have been enough for the industry to promote moderation with edible pot. ' i think the word has gotten out that you need to be careful with edibles , ' said @entity146 , head of the @entity41 - based @entity147			0
the group organized the ' @entity150 5 ' campaign , which cautions that new users should n't eat more than 5 milligrams of marijuana 's psychoactive ingredient , or half a suggested serving			1
the campaign warns users that edible pot can be much more potent than the marijuana they 're smoking â€” and that the pot - infused treats on store shelves are much stronger than homemade brownies they may recall eating			1
the advocacy ads tackle anti-drug messaging from year past			0
inside pictures of old tv sets are images from historic ads. along with the fried - egg one is an image from one ad of a father finding his son 's drug stash and demanding to know who taught him to use it			2
the kid answers : ' you , all right ! i learned it by watching you ! ' the print ad concludes , ' decades of fear - mongering and condescending anti-marijuana ads have not taught us anything about the substance or made anyone safer			1
' it then directs viewers to @entity193 , which is patterned after the alcohol industry 's ' @entity196 ' campaign			0
marijuana activists plan to spend $ 75,000 by year 's end and eventually expand it to @entity201 , where pot is also legal .			0

activists say anti-pot campaigns have relied on ' fear mongering ' and insulting users
the campaign is a direct response to @entity2 's *current* marijuana - education efforts following legalization
advocates say : ' decades of condescending anti-marijuana ads have not taught us anything about the substance or made anyone safer '
