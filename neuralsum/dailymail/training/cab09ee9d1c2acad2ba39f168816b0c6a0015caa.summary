no amount of left - over wrapping can paper over the cracks at @entity1			1
sitting bottom of the @entity6 , the @entity4 are in desperate need of some comfort and joy			1
the @entity12 club have suffered 10 defeats in 10 games and are in danger of becoming only the second team in league history to be relegated without a single victory			2
these are new experiences for @entity20 , their @entity22 winning scrum - half			1
his first three months in the @entity23 delivered more losses than nine seasons as a @entity27 international , but the veteran is not afraid of mucking in			2
former @entity27 scrum half @entity20 dives to try and tackle @entity31 ' @entity30 last saturday ‘ i ’ve been in backs - to - the - wall situations before , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ leading into the @entity22 , the @entity27 lost two games in a row			1
we were expected to win it but we kept focused on what we needed to achieve			2
‘ the circumstances are different here but we ’ve just got to try to overcome it			0
people need to sell papers and they might talk rubbish about you to do that , but that does n’t mean we have to buy into it			0
comments in the tabloids can ruin your mood if you let them , but we just need to train our backsides off and stay positive			0
’ @entity31 scored 11 tries against @entity1 in the 78 - 7 win , the worst defeat the @entity4 have suffered this year played 10 , lost 10 points for 80 , against 490 average possession per game : 14.41minutes goal kicking accuracy : 55 % missed tackles per game : 28 @entity62 conceded per game : 15 lineout success : 75 % @entity66 success : 78 % improvements are needed across the board			1
@entity1 have managed less than 15 minutes possession per game this season and have lost by an average of 41 points			1
they have fired in neither attack nor defence , but one of their most consistent downfalls has been at the set - piece			2
during their 78 - 7 defeat by @entity31 on saturday , they lost eight out of 13 lineouts on their own throw			1
their scrum did not fare much better and , throughout the season , they have lost 20 per cent of ball on their own feed			1
this is compounded by an average concession of 15 turnovers per game , leaving the recently promoted side in desperate need of a morale boost			2
a victory over @entity97 on @entity98 would be the perfect festive tonic , with @entity97 sitting one place above @entity1 in the league			1
@entity20 , for one has not given up hope			1
@entity103 touches down a solitary consolation try for @entity1 , but @entity20 insists they are improving ‘ if there ’s no belief left , then we probably should n’t be in the competition , ’ said the 31 - year - old			1
‘ i still love the sport			0
i still love lacing up the boots and getting amongst it			0
even if we ’re getting pumped , i still love it			0
as long as you try your hardest , then that ’s all we can really ask			0
we just need to get our roles right — we create opportunities in games but then we ’re not picking the right options			0
’ former @entity123 back row @entity121 was brought in as a defence coach last month in a bid to turn around the club ’s fortunes			0
a losing bonus point against @entity129 showed signs of progress , but the @entity4 still boast the worst tackle success rate in the league , missing an average of 28 per game			1
@entity121 says there have been statistical improvements over the last seven weeks but is fully aware of the scale of the challenge			0
despite the leakiest defence in the league , @entity121 insists the defence is getting tougher ‘ there ’s no fairy godmother who ’s going to make everything perfect , ’ said @entity121			2
‘ i joined this group about eight weeks ago and the timing meant i could n’t just rip everything up and start again			0
it ’s hard for me to convince people , but i have seen a certain improvement			0
there is hunger , but we ’re not going to win on pure emotion			0
we need better structures to earn our right to win			0
the players know they have to improve and they want to improve			0
’ @entity121 has been tasked with fixing the problems but the roots , he believes , stem from the short summer turnaround			0
the @entity4 were rank outsiders for promotion but beat @entity165 through the controversial play - off system			1
while @entity165 had already recruited heavily for what seemed inevitable promotion , @entity1 panicked in the transfer market place with sporadic recruitment , signing players on a shoestring budget			1
@entity20 has bags of experience from his time with the @entity27 , and believes his side can turn things around ‘ things happened pretty quickly , ’ said @entity121			1
‘ the play - off season goes on late and the @entity6 starts early , so our training and recruitment were affected by the preparation time			1
you ’ve got a small window , with players coming off a tough @entity188 season			2
there ’s about a one - week break and then you ’re back in			2
that has a bearing on how your season unfolds			2
‘ any gambling man would have bet on @entity165 to walk into the @entity6 , but it did n’t happen			0
some say the system is n’t effective and there should be no promotion or relegation , but we ’re trying to get away from a ring - fence mentality			2
@entity204 are an example of a team who got promoted and grew			0
as soon as you close it off , then that kills off a lot of teams ’ ambitions			0
’ the plight of @entity1 , it seems , will do little for the cause .			1

@entity1 have lost every game so far this season
the @entity4 have picked up just one losing bonus point
but star scrum - half @entity20 insists things are improving
