by @entity0 published : 07:25 est , 30 december 2012 updated : 02:45 est , 31 december 2012 the arrival of a first grandchild is usually a source of great celebration			2
and for @entity6 and @entity7 it would appear to be a good business opportunity too			1
only weeks after the official announcement that the @entity11 is expecting her first child , her parents are promoting a range of baby goods on their party supplies website			1
the @entity7 family : mother @entity6 , right , with children @entity17 and @entity19 , and husband @entity7 new range : the royal - themed first birthday party celebration sets available on the @entity24 website new little prince : just one of the items available in the new range first birthday party sets for boys the ‘ @entity25 ’ and ‘ @entity34 ’ party packs are described as suitable for @entity31 - style baby showers , christening parties or first birthday celebrations			1
each pack – advertised on the @entity24 website as ‘ new ’ – includes paper cups , napkins and plastic cutlery			1
they also include paper plates decorated with a pink or blue crown and the words ‘ a new little prince ’ or ‘ a new little princess ’			0
a message on the site says : ‘ it ’s a great occasion to celebrate before the new arrival , inviting family and friends along			2
‘ it ’s also tradition for the other mothers to share their wisdom and own knowledge of becoming a mother ! ’ parents - to - be : prince @entity58 , @entity58 and @entity11 , the @entity11 , are expecting their first child miniature castles , ‘ prince ’ and ‘ princess ’ banners and balloons are among the other royal baby - themed products available on the site			1
expectant parents might also be tempted by other kits , such as a @entity71 party pack			0
the products leave the @entity72 open to accusations that they are cashing in on the royal pregnancy			1
and it would not be the first time the website , set up by @entity78 in 1987 , has landed the family in hot water			2
earlier this year , it offered paraphernalia themed around the @entity83 and the @entity84			0
its street party items included state carriage - shaped cardboard teapot vases , coat of arms cups printed with ‘ @entity89 ’ and canape flags featuring crown - wearing corgis			0
the company – which mrs @entity11 started from scratch by making party bags around her kitchen table – had a dispute with @entity99 ’s @entity98 after using the show ’s logo on the site without permission and on another occasion fell foul of strict advertising laws covering the @entity107			0
it also rowed with @entity111 film producers @entity109 after using the logo for the latest @entity111 film , @entity114			0
although accounts for the company are not publicly available , it is clearly a success for the @entity119 , who recently bought a £ 4.7million country home and put their three children through private school .			0
