phone , wallet , keys – it ’s the usual mental checklist many of us go through before leaving the house			1
but remembering the keys could soon be redundant thanks to a new mobile phone app. the app , called @entity12 , securely stores electronic versions of keys for multiple locks on a smartphone or tablet			1
the app connects to a @entity25 enabled lock , right , which means doors can be unlocked wirelessly , without having to get a phone out of a pocket or bag			1
the user just needs to touch the lock to get the door to open @entity12 works in a similar way to the august lock announced in the @entity36 earlier this year			1
it runs on two aa batteries and a reminder is sent to the owner when the battery levels get low			0
once installed the homeowner activates their device			0
the august lock can then be managed using a mobile app and online			0
the encrypted locking technology issues registered devices , or invited devices , with unique codes that ca n't be copied			0
to open the lock , anyone with a code can approach the door , enable their phone 's @entity25 and press the relevant address from the app. the lock takes a few seconds to scan for a paired @entity25 device			1
it then confirms the visitor 's identity			0
when a user approaches a saved location , such as an office or a house , the phone can wirelessly unlock the door using bluetooth meaning users only have to touch a lock to open a door and do n't even need to remove the device from their pocket			1
the app is currently only available for @entity75 devices but the company said it is working on @entity78 and @entity79 versions			0
to convert a door into a @entity12 - enabled door , users need to buy and install new deadbolt locks on all the doors they wish to use with the app. @entity12 costs £ 144 and this includes these new locks			1
once enabled , users can send @entity89 to friends and family , allowing them to gain access to premises on either a permanent or temporary basis			2
to prevent unauthorised access , the app can detect whether a user is already inside , for example , using @entity99 before granting access and each individual user can be uniquely identified			2
the locks are supplied with a physical key so users can gain access if their phone battery runs flat or they wish to go out without it			2
fobs are also included in the @entity12 pack for children who do n't have a smartphone , or for people who do n't have an @entity75 device			1
the @entity12 smart lock package costs £ 144 and includes one deadbolt as well as two @entity116 that can be sent to friends and family			1
the deadbolt comes in three finishes including @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 , pictured the @entity12 pack also comes with a fob and two traditional keys for people without smartphones , or in case their phone battery dies the locks rely on a @entity25 connection , which is the technology used by many wireless hands - free phone kits			1
@entity135 and @entity136 say 79 per cent of people aged 18 to 44 now have their smartphone on them for at least 22 hours a day			0
the company believe users will appreciate not having to carry around a bunch of keys everywhere they go			0
@entity144 , from @entity145 , said : ' @entity12 is the first deadbolt intelligent enough to communicate with a smartphone and unlock with a simple touch			2
' this technology is so convenient that users do not even need to remove the smartphone from their pocket or purse when unlocking their door			0
' @entity12 is a game - changing door lock that uses modern technology and the convenience of touch to evolve the traditional key			2
it has never been done before			0
' @entity161 , from @entity162 , which worked alongside @entity145 , added : ' by uniquely combining existing mobile and bluetooth technologies , we ’re bringing your front door into the digital age without compromising the look or security of the lock			0
' the @entity12 smart lock package includes one deadbolt , one fob , two mechanical keys and two smartphone @entity116			1
the deadbolt comes in three finishes including @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122			0
@entity12 operates on four included aa batteries , which the company claims should last for a year depending on usage .			2
