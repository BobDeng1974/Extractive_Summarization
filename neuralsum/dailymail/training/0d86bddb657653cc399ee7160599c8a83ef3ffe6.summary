by @entity0 published : 10:13 est , 7 april 2013 updated : 18:07 est , 7 april 2013 for most families , eating meals together is a pleasure			1
but for one set of parents and their two children , it proved the route to disaster			1
but the overweight @entity11 family have managed to beat the bulge and have shed an astonishing 23 stone between them			1
@entity15 , 47 , was spurred into action when she begun to have trouble breathing because of her weight			1
@entity20 slimmers : the @entity11 family have lost a staggering 23 stone between them galvanised into action , she was joined by her equally overweight family - all of whom have dropped an impressive number of pounds			1
she managed to lose eight stone , her son @entity30 , 25 , has shed over nine stone , her daughter @entity32 , 14 , has lost nearly four stone , and her husband @entity34 , 49 , has lost nearly three stone			1
@entity15 , an educational skills tutor , said : ' it is hard to believe that we have lost so much weight between us			1
we all feel so much better for it , we feel like a different family			2
we have lost 23 stone between us , in just a year			1
' the family piled on weight after eating four takeaways a week			2
they would binge on curries , @entity48 food , pizza and kebabs , and would snack on chocolate and family sized bags of crisps			2
before changing their diets , @entity15 weighed a massive 23st 2lbs , @entity30 23st 6 lbs , @entity58 and @entity59			1
@entity15 was so overweight that it was caused her to stop breathing as many as 20 times each night			1
she said : ' it was frightening			2
i had to be hooked up to a machine each night to keep my airways open and stop them collapsing			2
' i went to see the doctor and he told me that if i did n’t lose weight it would shorten my life by 40 per cent			2
i needed to be around to help my children grow up			2
' when the doctor told me that , it felt like my whole world had collapsed around me			2
it was a frightening thing to hear - it was like i had been given a death sentence			1
i knew that i had to do something about it whilst i still could			2
' healthy : according to mum , @entity15 , cutting out the junk food has made a huge difference to their wellbeing parents : before losing weight , @entity15 ( left ) was having trouble breathing and was terrified of dying young @entity15 was referred for a gastric bypass operation , but before the operation could go ahead , she needed to lose some weight herself			1
so she decided to join @entity93 in january last year and go on a diet			2
her son @entity30 came with her as he wanted to be healthy enough to join the police force			0
and daughter @entity32 came along two weeks later as she was getting bullied at school because of her weight			0
@entity15 said : ' we all had our problems with our weight			1
it was getting us down as a family			0
i could n’t move more than a few feet without getting out of breath and i was risking my life each time i went to bed at night			0
' @entity30 was desperate to join the police force , but at 23st , he was far too fat to do that			1
and @entity32 was getting bullied at school because of her weight which was heartbreaking			0
' as a mum i really wanted to help her , so i knew that it would be a good idea if we could all lose the weight together			0
' so the family ditched the takeaways and instead had cereal for breakfast , pasta for lunch and home made curry for dinner			0
they snacked on fruit and yoghurt			0
@entity15 said : ' it was surprisingly easy			1
our favourite meal was a mushy pea curry which was a @entity93 receipe			0
it tasted fantastic and we did n’t miss our takeaways at all			0
' we still managed to go to @entity134 for the occasional treat , but we ’d all have small portions of fries , instead of the large ones			0
' thwarted : @entity30 was too fat to realise his ambition of becoming a policeman while @entity32 was being bullied @entity15 managed to lose four stone and was allowed to have her gastric bypass operation in july			1
she has since lost a total of 8st 1lb , and has gone from a dress size 30 to a much slimmer size 16			1
she said : ' i wanted to make sure i would never put the weight back on again , and i thought that was the best way i could guarantee that			0
it is a big operation , but my life was at stake and i wanted to live as long as possible to see my children grow up			0
' i feel like a different person now			0
i do n’t have to be hooked up to the machine at night and i do n’t stop breathing anymore			0
even my feet have shrunk two sizes , from a size seven to a size five			0
and my ring size has dropped too			0
' @entity30 can achieve his dream of now being in the police force - his waist has gone from a size 52 inches to 36			1
and @entity32 is n’t getting bullied at school anymore			0
she wore a skirt to school for the first time in september instead of trousers and i was so proud of her			0
' @entity34 joined in with the diet too and he has managed to lose nearly three stone too , so he feels much healthier too			1
we feel like a completely different family			0

at 23st 2lb , @entity15 was at risk of dying early
