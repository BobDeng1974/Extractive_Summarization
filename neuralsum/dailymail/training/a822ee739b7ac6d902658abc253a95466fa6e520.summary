she saw the ' enormous ' creature while being shown around by locals as she recorded her @entity19 show ramblings			1
there have been numerous sightings of big cat - like creatures across the country since the 90s - but there has been little concrete evidence to prove their existence			1

' it was the most enormous black cat			1
i mean really big , like a dog size			0
' @entity49 , who was giving her guided tour of the picturesque locale , told her he too had seen it twice in the same location over the past few years			2

' over the years there have been a number of sightings of big cats in the @entity99 countryside			2
although the animals are sometimes pictured , and carcasses with wounds similar to those inflicted in an attack by such a predator have been found , their existence has never been conclusively proved			2
in november , scientists announced they may have found evidence to show that big cats really are roaming the @entity99 countryside , by analysing teeth marks on the bones of their ' victims '			2
some believe that the animals are the descendents of large species such as panthers , leopards and lynx which were released into the wild in the 1970s after their owners were banned from keeping them as pets expert dr @entity124 believes he found proof that big cats have been stalking @entity126 and neighbouring counties by analysing the remains of wild animals , which appear to have been eaten by beasts larger than any known @entity99 carnivores			0
dr @entity124 , a senior lecturer in animal science at the @entity134 in @entity135 , has spent the last year examining 20 animal skeletons which all bore unusual teethmarks			0
some of the livestock and deer remains , found by farmers , landowners and volunteers , had been found in unusual circumstances which suggested that they may have been killed by a big cat			2

in 2005 , a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the @entity182 close to @entity183 and last month a couple claim they spotted a black panther on the loose in an @entity187 field , describing it as a ‘ big scary cat ’			1
@entity189 and husband @entity190 were at home when they allegedly spotted the beast , which they claim was ‘ jet black ’ and ‘ too big ’ to be a dog or cat			1
mrs @entity189 , 56 , took this photo of the unknown animal on her @entity200 after she spotted it on the edge of @entity202			0
in august 2012 a blurry picture of what resembles a big cat prowling around a patch of countryside near @entity150 in @entity126 emerged			1

in 2005 , a skull with large fangs and thought to be the remains of a big cat were found in the @entity182 close to the moor			2
the skull was sent to the @entity223 in @entity224 for verification			0
they determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard , but also found that the cat had not died in @entity99			0
in fact , the skull had been imported as part of a leopard - skin rug			0
the @entity234 conducted an official investigation into the ' beast ' and other unknown animals reported to be roaming @entity99 in 1995			0
it concluded there was no ' verifiable evidence ' of exotic felines loose in @entity99 ,			0
but it also stated that the investigation could not prove that big cats were ' not present ' .			0
