@entity1 militants fighting for @entity2 appear to have released another propaganda video - this time showing a laughing jihadist mocking @entity6 president @entity5			1
the 15 - minute long professionally edited video , filmed somewhere along the rebel - controlled border between @entity10 and @entity11 , shows an unidentified fighter pulling up to the camera in a @entity15 350 pick - up truck and asking : ' @entity5 , did you prepare enough diapers for your soldiers ? '			1
the slick video clip carries the logo of the @entity21 - the propaganda division of @entity2 , which was also responsible for last month 's slick recruitment video featuring three young @entity24 jihadists pleading with other @entity25 to join them in the @entity26			2
he then crosses the border and steps on an old signpost marking out the former crossing commander 's office the bulk of the video - which is titled ' @entity54 of @entity46 ' - features @entity38 , an apparent @entity2 militant who claims he comes from @entity39 and speaks in perfect @entity40 , albeit with an accent			1
standing along the now effectively redundant border between @entity10 and @entity11 , @entity56 begins a long rant about the 1916 @entity46 - the secret pact between @entity24 and @entity59 that resulted in the carving up of the @entity61 after the @entity62			1
@entity38 breaks into a long tirade about how @entity2 ' lightning advance through eastern @entity11 and @entity10 has effectively destroyed the borders quietly drawn up by the @entity67 forces , before issuing a warning that @entity2 plans on extending the territory under its control			1
the @entity46 agreement features prominently in @entity2 propaganda - most notably in last week 's fourth edition of the militant group 's slick @entity40 - language weekly magazine , which tells the story of the aftermath of the @entity62 through a distinctly @entity1 perspective			1
@entity79 : @entity45 shows flags and military badges that were left behind by government troops when they fled the border			2
he then mocks the mainly @entity85 forces for displaying swords on their clothing one disturbing scene shows a room full of traumatised @entity85 prisoners ( pictured )			1
standing over them in a cramped room with no windows , @entity56 abuses the men for ' worshiping @entity96 ' , before locking the door transport : @entity56 boasts that @entity2 now holds scores of @entity6 - supplied vehicles that were stolen from government soldiers and border guards when the jihadists swept into @entity10 's second city @entity105 one of the major claims repeated in @entity108 propaganda is that the militants are ' correcting ' wrongs established by the 1916 @entity46			1
the secret pact between @entity24 and @entity59 - which resulted in the carving up of the @entity61 after the @entity62 - is mentioned in most material released by @entity2 ' @entity114			1
indeed this latest video is even titled ' @entity54 of @entity46 '			0
the 1916 agreement effectively divided the @entity118 provinces of the @entity61 outside the @entity120 peninsula into areas of future @entity24 and @entity59 control			0
the secret agreement is seen by many as a turning point in @entity127 - @entity118 relations , as it broke a number of promises made to @entity131 rulers about the founding of a caliphate in @entity11			2
now , almost 100 years on , @entity2 uses these broken promises as a rallying cry - saying the borders drawn up by the pact represent ongoing @entity138 influence in the @entity26			2
@entity46 also failed to take account of different ethnic groups in the region - creating new countries that were already steeped in sectarian divisions			0
the caliphate @entity2 said it had established on sunday was partially declared to remove the internationally recognised borders established by @entity46			2
this has the twin - effect of diminishing @entity138 influence on @entity26 geography , and strengthening the authority of @entity150 in @entity151			0
after symbolically crossing the border and stepping on an old signpost marking out the former crossing commander 's office , @entity38 begins talking about the @entity157 government soldiers that deserted their posts in the face of the @entity2 advance			1
he shows military badges that were removed from discarded uniforms , and mocks the mainly @entity85 forces for displaying swords on their clothing			2
' as you can see there are weapons and swords and the @entity157 flag , but they are nothing but cowards they only run away , ' he says			0
' the soldiers , they took these [ badges ] off with their uniforms and they threw the uniforms in the streets and ran away like they were civilians			0
they are cowards , ' he adds			0
this video then cuts to a disturbing scene - which @entity56 jokes is ' exclusive footage ' - appearing to show a room full of traumatised @entity85 prisoners			1
standing over them in a cramped room with no windows , @entity56 verbally abuses the men for ' worshiping @entity96 ' , before locking the door			2
the clip then shows @entity38 and a group of men destroying an abandoned police station with explosives			0
@entity38 goes on to boast that @entity2 now holds scores of @entity6 - supplied vehicles that were stolen from government soldiers and border guards when the jihadists swept into @entity10 's second city @entity105			1
he jokes that the @entity6 has spent billions in conflicts in @entity10 and @entity206 and , rather than make the region safer , has only succeeded in indirectly providing militants with vehicles and weapons			2
' look at how much money @entity6 spends to fight @entity212 and it ends up being in our pockets , ' @entity45 says			0
the clip then cuts to the scene on the @entity2 fighter pulling up to the camera in the @entity15 pick - up truck and mocking @entity6 president @entity5			1
daring the @entity6 military to take on @entity2 , the militant says @entity6 soldiers would be too terrified to take on the rebel forces , suggesting they would need to pack nappies if they intervene in @entity10			1
the slick video clip carries the logo of the @entity21 - the propaganda division of @entity2 , which was also responsible for last month 's slick recruitment video featuring three young @entity24 jihadists ( pictured ) upon declaring a caliphate , the @entity150 militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in @entity10 and @entity11 has been branded too extreme even by @entity236 - demanded allegiance from @entity25 around the world leader : @entity2 has declared its chief , @entity239 ( pictured left and right ) , the head of the new caliphate under the name @entity243 and called on all @entity25 around the world to swear loyalty to him caliphate : a map purportedly showing the areas @entity2 plans to have under its control within five years has been widely shared online			1
as well as the @entity26 , @entity250 and large areas of @entity252 , it also reveals @entity2 ' ambition to extend into @entity254			0
@entity255 , which was @entity131 - ruled until the late 15th century , would form part of the caliphate , as would the @entity259 states and eastern @entity254 , up to and including @entity260 the video emerged just two days after @entity2 formally declared the territory it controls in the @entity26 to be a caliphate , and announced its leader @entity239 as the new leader of all the world 's @entity25			2
the chilling announcement was described as the ' most significant development in international jihadism since 9/11 '			0
upon declaring a caliphate , the @entity150 militants - whose brutality in attempting to establish control in @entity10 and @entity11 has been branded too extreme even by @entity236 - demanded allegiance from @entity25 around the world			2
with brutal efficiency , @entity2 has carved out a large chunk of territory that has effectively erased the border between @entity10 and @entity11 and laid the foundations of its proto - state			1
now that it feels it has secure the territory under its control , the group announced it would be changing its name from the @entity2 ( also known as the @entity286 ) , to just the @entity287 , in order to appear less regional			0
@entity2 militants are in possession of a massive long - distance ballistic missile , supporters of the jihadist group have claimed			1
photographs show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by masked men in the @entity300 city of @entity301 - the proclaimed capital of the new @entity131 caliphate			0
supporters of the group - which changed its name to the @entity287 upon declaring the establishment of a caliphate on sunday - said the missile was a @entity308 , although experts analysing the images believe the weapon is almost certainly inoperable and highly unlikely to pose a threat			0
missile : photographs show a large weapon being paraded on the back on a lorry surrounded by masked men in the @entity300 city of @entity301 - the proclaimed capital of the new @entity131 caliphate the weapon pictured being paraded by @entity2 militants in @entity301 is believed to have been captured from another rebel group , the @entity319			1
the @entity319 are understood to have acquired the @entity321 - built missile when it captured a military base from government forces in the @entity324 of @entity11 last september			1
it is not known how the weapon ended up in the hands of @entity2 , but social media accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in @entity10 and @entity11 claimed they are now preparing it for use			1
' @entity331 ( @entity332 ) has scud missile in # @entity301			0
[ @entity336 willing ] its heading towards # @entity337 for a spectacular @entity338 , ' an @entity2 suspporter calling himself @entity335 said on @entity339			0
a number of experts have poured cold water on the idea that the missile could be a threat , however			0
mystery : it is not known how the weapon ended up in the hands of @entity2 , but social media accounts linked to militants fighting for the group in @entity10 and @entity11 claimed they are now preparing it for use @entity351 , a blogger who tracks munitions used in @entity11 , tweeted : ' the only danger that @entity287 scud is to anyone at the moment is if they accidentally run over a pedestrian showing it off			2
' meanwhile @entity359 - an expert on the @entity300 conflict who works at the at the @entity364 research organisation - called the missile 99 per cent useless , according to the @entity365			0
this morning , @entity10 's newly elected members of parliament attended their first government session in @entity370 's heavily fortified @entity369			0
the new parliament ended its inaugural session by failing to make any progress in choosing a new prime minister - even as the country faces a militant blitz that threatens to rip it apart			0
world leaders and senior clerics have urged @entity10 's fractious politicians to unite in the face of the militant onslaught , which has killed more than 2,000 people , displaced hundreds of thousands and polarised the country 's @entity85 , @entity150 and @entity386 populations .			0
