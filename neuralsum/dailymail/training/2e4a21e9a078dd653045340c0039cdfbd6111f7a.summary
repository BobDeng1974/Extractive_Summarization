' @entity96 28 , a pa from @entity49 , is a fan of @entity99 's @entity98 : ' i love it , i 've always had facial treatments and i do n't see this as any different			0
' it used to be all about how your breasts looked , but my bum is my best asset and deserves looking after ; now it 's really smooth and healthier looking , i 'm much happier and more confident too			0
' @entity65 gets a chemical peel from @entity110 as part of getting her $ 500 ( £ 300 ) butt facial at dr. @entity114 's plastic surgery office in @entity115 , where bottom facials are already popular registered with the @entity118 for over twenty five years , dr @entity17 has more than thirty years medical experience , including anaesthetics , is a member of the @entity122 ; the @entity123 and @entity124 and the @entity125			1

@entity65 , 21 , had the procedure done to rid her bottom of cellulite , dimples , and dark spots and she could n't be happier with the results			0
speaking about the treatment , @entity65 said : ' every girl wants to feel confident when they 're on the beach - before i tried the booty facial , i was n't as confident as i am now			2
