by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 boss @entity2 hopes @entity4 has returned from his @entity6 commitments in decent condition to face @entity8 on saturday			1
@entity4 scored an eye - catching solo effort to steer the @entity11 to a shock 1 - 0 @entity14 victory at reigning champions @entity15 on august 30			1
since then the forward has been on @entity6 duty for @entity19 qualifiers at home against @entity21 last friday and then in @entity22 on wednesday			1
@entity2 hopes @entity4 has returned from his @entity6 commitments in a decent condition @entity4 scored an eye - catching solo effort to steer @entity3 to a shock 1 - 0 win over @entity15 having only returned from his considerable travels to @entity3 's training ground on friday , @entity4 will not have had a chance to do a session with his team - mates ahead of saturday 's league game			1
and @entity2 said at his pre-match press conference at the @entity36 on friday afternoon : ' @entity4 was walking into the training ground as i left , funnily enough , so i had a chance to speak to him			2
' by all accounts he is okay , but we have to make a judgement on him just to see how he is physically , and mentally , in terms of the amount of travelling he has done and how that will affect his approach to the game			0
' we will get a feeling for that before the game and then i 'll make a decision as to whether he plays or not			0
' the win against @entity15 was @entity3 's first in the league of the season following a 1 - 0 home defeat to @entity57 and then a 1 - 1 draw at @entity59			1
@entity2 has no doubt it is best to head into an international break off the back of a victory , but is frustrated that the domestic hiatus came along when his side were gathering some momentum			2
' obviously the breaks are in the season , you know they are coming and you have to make the best of it , ' @entity2 said			0
' the best way to go into an international break is with a positive result			0
it is a lot easier to take when you have played well and got maximum points - then everyone goes away in good heart			0
@entity4 scored the only goal as @entity3 beat @entity15 1 - 0 and they have @entity8 next ' it is slightly different if you have a poor performance , you have been beaten and then all of a sudden people are flying all over the world and you have no time to review what went on or address some of the issues the game brought up			1
' so we had the better of that this time having won at @entity15 , but it is a little bit frustrating for everybody because it is a little bit fragmented at the moment			0
' the season needs to get up and running , but after only three games , we are having international breaks			0
' @entity2 nonetheless believes the @entity15 victory will have set his players in good stead for the @entity8 contest , although he sees the desire to make up for a poor home performance in the @entity57 match as a greater motivator ahead of saturday 's fixture			1
@entity3 manager @entity2 hopes @entity4 will be ready for their @entity8 match the @entity110 said : ' i think we can use ( the @entity15 game ) by saying that is the standard in terms of committing to what we are trying to do			1
we have set the bar			0
' but i think the fact that our last home league game was a little bit flat from our point of view , when there had been a lot of expectation on us before it and on the day @entity57 were the better team - i think we will use that as more of a motivation than possibly the @entity15 game for this one			2
' winger @entity130 is in contention to make his ' second debut ' for @entity3 on saturday after rejoining on another season - long loan deal from @entity134 on transfer deadline day			2
midfielder @entity136 ( rib ) looks set to miss out along with @entity138 ( hernia ) and @entity140 ( knee ) , both of whom have undergone surgery .			0
