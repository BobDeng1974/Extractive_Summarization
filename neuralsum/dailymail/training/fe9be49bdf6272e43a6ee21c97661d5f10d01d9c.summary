by @entity0 carrying a phone in your pocket all day may seem harmless , but there 's a growing body of evidence linking devices to impotence , infertility and low sperm count			0
concerned about the health of his ' little swimmers ' , a physician from @entity15 created a range of underwear fitted with silver ' cages ' to protect them from radiation			1
the mesh of silver is woven into the fabric of the pants and shields the wearer from electromagnetic rays from phones , tablets and other devices - creating a so - called @entity31 cage			1
the cotton in @entity34 underwear , pictured , is woven with a mesh of silver that shields wearers from electromagnetic radiation			1
it creates what 's called a @entity31 cage that uses conductive materials to block electromagnetic energy			1
this radiation is produced by phones , tablets , laptops and other electronic devices faraday cages , named after inventor @entity31 , are used to protect electronics from interference			1
they are made using meshes of conductive material			0
these block external static and non-static electric fields			0
for example , systems in parliament , banks and stock market servers are protected by the technology			0
in the @entity34 underwear range , thin threads of silver are woven in with the cotton during the production stage			1
wireless ’ @entity34 ’s @entity31 cage fabric has been independently tested and was found to shield 99.97 per cent of @entity70			1

for example , systems in parliament , banks and stock market servers are protected by the technology			0
in the @entity34 range , thin threads of silver are woven in with cotton during the production stage			1
this strengthens the underwear , but also makes them antimicrobial , protecting them from bacteria and keeping them smelling fresh			1
each pair has approximately 20 per cent silver woven into the fabric			1
@entity34 underpants are available in two styles - tight - fitting @entity94 or loose trunks			1
there are then two versions of each - either a 360 model which protects from radiation in the front and back pockets , or an 180 model that only provides protection on the front of the body			2

the @entity124 is pictured physics graduate and ceo @entity125 , 26 , has now launched an @entity128 campaign to fund production of his underwear range , and expects products to go on sale by july this year			2
the pants are expected to retail for £ 35 ( $ 58 ) , but campaign backers can get a pair for £ 14 ( $ 23 )			1
@entity125 is looking to raise £ 30,000 ( $ 50,000 ) and has so far achieved just short of £ 400 ( $ 672 )			2
the campaign runs until 28 may and has been verified by @entity128 as a genuine product			0
@entity125 said : ‘ @entity34 is designed to protect the health of a wireless generation glued to their mobile devices			2
men who use mobile phones could be risking their fertility , according to two separate studies from @entity146 and @entity147			0
both studies found a ' worrying link ' between poor sperm and the number of hours a day a man uses his mobile phone			0
in the @entity146 study , men who made calls on a mobile phone for more than four hours a day had the worst sperm counts and the poorest quality sperm			0
the @entity147 research noticed the correlation after six hours of phone use a day			0
however , neither study found sperm count was affected			0
doctors believe the damage could be caused by the electromagnetic radiation emitted by handsets or the heat they generate			1
previous studies found using a laptop has a similar impact on fertility levels in men , due to the heat released from the battery			0
elsewhere , the heat of kitchens has been linked to low fertility levels in some chefs			0
' we are exposing ourselves to unprecedented levels of electromagnetic radiation and this is showing with our declining sperm counts and increasing cases of cancer			1
‘ although the evidence is not conclusive it is piling up			2
our goal is to make protection as easy as getting dressed ! ’ last month , scientists found men who hold their mobiles for more than four hours a day are more likely to suffer from impotence than those who limit usage to less than two hours			2
for the study , researchers recruited 20 men who had experienced problems with erectile function in the six months prior to the study			0
they also studied 10 healthy men with no history of dysfunction			0
the men who had previously suffered from erectile problems were found to carry their devices for a ‘ significantly longer time ’ than the healthy men - 4.4 hours a day compared to 1.8 hours a day			2
this backed up the findings of two other , separate studies in @entity147 and the @entity214 from last year			0
both studies found a ' worrying link ' between poor sperm and the number of hours a day a man uses his mobile phone			0
however , all the researchers said more needs to be done to establish what causes the problem and the extent of damage mobiles can cause .			0

the cotton in @entity34 underwear is woven with a mesh of silver
the silver ‘ cage ’ stops electromagnetic radiation going through the pants
this creates a so - called @entity31 cage and shields 99.97 *%* of @entity70 radiation
silver also makes the briefs antimicrobial and keeps them smelling fresh
@entity34 underwear is expected to ship in july for £ 35 ( $ 58 ) a pair
