@entity41 allowed foreign football stars to have their wages paid into a trust , so they could withdraw the money after they stopped living in @entity46 and therefore avoid the top 50 per cent rate of @entity46 tax			1
one of the reasons @entity2 fell into administration is the probe by @entity34 into the use of @entity53 - a complex tax avoidance scheme			1
the @entity25 giants are understood to have used @entity41 for the decade leading up to @entity20 taking over the club last year			1
@entity41 were until recently considered an efficient way of reducing tax – but companies with disputed @entity38 issues had to settle them by december 31 last year			1
companies pay into a trust , which loans the money to the employee for benefits			2
examples of these benefits are pensions or the purchase of shares			0
the money is never meant to be repaid			0
@entity41 allowed foreign players to have their wages paid into a trust and withdraw the money when they were no longer living in @entity46 - therefore avoiding the top 50 per cent rate of @entity46 tax			1
@entity34 claim @entity2 ’ previous owners used @entity80 to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax and @entity82 on the player payroll			1
the taxman has declared the practice illegal — and claims the club 's previous owners used the trusts to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax and @entity82 on the player payroll			1
' @entity2 may be the tip of the iceberg , ' football finance expert dr @entity90 told @entity93 ' @entity41 became popular with clubs as a means of reducing crippling wage bills			1
' we believe at least eight current or former @entity8 clubs are being investigated			1
' @entity2 boss @entity21 summed up the feelings of all the club 's fans yesterday , saying : ' it has been a very disappointing and black day			1
' we have 140 years of fantastic history , but the most important thing is that we look to the future and the next 140 years			0
' going into administration obviously was n't ideal , but it 's the opinion of many people that it might be the best thing			0
' fans protested outside the @entity32 today , demanding answers from the club 's owner @entity20			1
@entity113 are now four points ahead of @entity2 at the top of the @entity8 - but the @entity11 club now have more pressing issues			1
@entity120 , of administrators @entity118 and @entity119 , told @entity122 : ' we will be conducting regular meetings with the staff and , wherever we can , will keep giving messages to the fans who we know have an interest in the work that we are doing			0
' i ca n't give any firm commitment but certainly over the next day or two we hope to get control of the finances of the club and to better understand what we need to do in the coming days and weeks			1
' the club had been in such a period of uncertainty that the administration will actually relieve that uncertainty and start to build the future			2
' former @entity2 player @entity142 has said he believes @entity144 's presence at @entity32 will soon be untenable			0
corrosion : mournful @entity2 supporters tie a scarf to a statue outside their stadium , as the nightmare begins to spread to @entity8 clubs in @entity1 @entity2 supporters are asking serious questions of @entity144 , who bought out sir @entity154 for £ 1 but pledged to settle @entity156 's £ 18m debt and invest in the playing squad and stadium			1
earlier this month , @entity144 admitted he had accessed cash from loan company @entity161 after reports claimed he had borrowed £ 24m on future season ticket sales			0
the main issues over alleged unpaid tax date from before @entity144 took over			2
but @entity142 still feels his relationship between the fans and @entity144 , who flew out of @entity168 last night , can not be mended			0
' i do n't think there has ever been a good relationship between @entity20 and the support , ' he said			0
' for me , there has always been smoke and mirrors since he came in			0
he came with a handful of promises that have never been delivered			0
' that 's what really aggravates the @entity2 support , they have never been able to trust the man in charge and there has been no transparency			0
' the fact that he has gone off to @entity188 is not particularly what the supporters want to hear			0
' administrators @entity118 and @entity119 have now moved to calm fans ' fears that their club will cease to exist			2
they have also confirmed that saturday 's @entity8 game against @entity196 at @entity32 will go ahead as planned			1
a statement said : ' we can report we have made very good progress within the first 24 hours of being appointed administrators over @entity2			0
' our first priority has been to ensure that the football club continues to function and this is being achieved with the help of staff , players and management at the club			2
' in particular , we would like to thank the club 's business partners who are going the extra mile to ensure that saturday ’s home match against @entity196 goes ahead as scheduled			2
we had extremely constructive discussions with @entity214 and we can confirm the match will take place			0
' we fully recognise this is a difficult time for players and staff at the club and are extremely appreciative of their reaction to the situation			2
we will be holding meetings with the staff on a weekly basis at least to inform them of developments			0
' we are also in the process of speaking to representatives of supporters ' groups and that will be an ongoing process			0
' in broad terms , supporters can be reassured that @entity2 will continue as a football club and we hope to reach a stage as soon as possible where the club can emerge from administration			2
' we have had expressions of support across the political spectrum in @entity25 within the last 24 hours and there is clearly a desire to see @entity2 come through this situation successfully			0
' there had been widespread publicity and speculation regarding the financial affairs of the football club			2
' for clarity , the cost structure of the club and ongoing losses were such that the club had outstanding liabilities to @entity34			2
' these were the subject of discussion and clearly @entity34 wished to see them resolved as a matter of urgency			0
we are involved in dialogue with @entity34 and will work with them constructively , as is the case with all other key stakeholders			0
