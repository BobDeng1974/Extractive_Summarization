a photographer has told of his shock after a conman stole one of his prized images which he used to win first place in an international competition			2
talented @entity7 had painstakingly created a beautiful black and white image of a motorcyclist riding through the fog next to a forest , which he had posted on several photographic websites			1
but it was shamelessly stolen by @entity24 member ‘ bogdhan ' , who flipped it horizontally , put it through one of the website 's filters and then entered it into @entity21 's ‘ live in the moment ' competition			1
original : @entity28 photographer @entity27 's original image of a motorcyclist riding through the fog stolen : instagram member ' bogdhan ' , flipped the image and put it through one of the website 's filters and then entered it into @entity21 's ' live in the moment ' competition the thief was awarded first place and was almost sent a prize of a £ 500 digital camera before the competition organisers were alerted to his scam			1
mr @entity27 , a fine - art photographer from @entity28 , had been tipped off about the theft by a friend about a month later and had contacted @entity21 just before the prize was sent out			1
@entity45 : ' @entity46 ' even had the front to criticise @entity27 after the theft was exposed incredibly the photograph was still posted on ' bogdhan 's ' @entity49 this week where it has attracted a flood of angry comments			1
user charlylouiselane wrote : ' as an illustrator and photographer who has dealt with copycats before i can only begin to try to express the upset that this causes , when you work so hard for something only for someone to swoop in and take the credit			2
' i do n't understand how you can not feel shame ? surely coming first place with your own content would be a much better feeling of pride than what you have done			0
' its shameful and pure greed			0
its disrespectful to creativity too to try and rip someone off for your own personal gain			0
' incredibly boghan used his instagram page to criticise mr @entity27 , suggesting he was only trying to get his hands on a prize which he did n't deserve			1
addressing his many critics he wrote : ' i suggest you all nicely to stop harassing me with such comments and mind your own business			0
' i read the rules before i participate and i 'm very aware that it was respected			0
so stop being some guy kissass'ers in order for him to claim a prize that he does n't deserve			0
' @entity21 later contacted mr @entity27 saying : ‘ thank you for alerting us in regard to this issue			1
we take copyright infringement very seriously and it is very unfortunate that [ the ] present case has taken place			0
shameless : the doctored image remains on @entity46 's instagram page where it has attracted a flurry of angry comments ‘ we have disqualified the applicant of this picture , and he is no longer the winner of the contest – neither will he receive the prize			2
' the competition , which was organised at @entity21 's headquarters in @entity109 , allowed entrants to submit photos via @entity112 and @entity24			1
they offered a prize of an @entity115 camera to the four category winners			0
speaking yesterday to amateur photographer magazine , which has published his work in the past , mr @entity27 called for more education about photographic copyright among the general public			2
he said : ‘ let 's warn other photographers to be careful with their work			0
' @entity46 used the image to win first prize in the @entity129 photography competition			2

@entity27 posted his image of a motorcyclist on several websites
instagram user ' bogdhan ' flipped it horizontally and put it through a filter
he entered it into a @entity21 competition and won a £ 500 digital camera
