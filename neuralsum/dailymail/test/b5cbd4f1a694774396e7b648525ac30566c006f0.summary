@entity0 hung his head in disbelief after wasting a golden opportunity to end his long wait for a century before the man who seems destined to succeed him as @entity7 captain showed how to do it			1
there was agony for @entity0 on the third day of the second test as he again fell short of the magic three figures despite looking as solid and unflustered at the crease as at any time in the two years since his last century			2
but the problems @entity0 had in finding fluency in his 211 - ball 76 were put into stark perspective by yet another display of the rare class and maturity that has made @entity23 @entity7 ’s outstanding batsman			1
@entity23 celebrates his century and is 118 not out at stumps on day three of the second test against the @entity27 @entity7 's @entity23 smashes a short ball to the boundary as @entity27 keeper and captain @entity31 can only watch on @entity23 plays confidently off the back foot through the offside during a commanding innings once he got his chance on day three @entity23 and @entity36 run between wickets as they easily work the @entity40 bowling around on a hot day in @entity41 @entity42 is giving a salute send - off by his @entity40 rival @entity44 after holing out for eight runs this has been another slow , attritional test in conditions that are hardly conducive to entertaining cricket			1
yet as soon as @entity23 took guard , batting at @entity41 ’s @entity51 was suddenly taken to another level			0
there were no problems for the @entity55 in reaching three figures — his sixth test century and his first overseas — and his average has now reached a hundred since his return to the @entity7 team last summer			2
here he took advantage of the solid platform that had been painstakingly laid by @entity0 and @entity65 to give @entity7 a chance of going on to the sort of total that could put pressure on @entity27 on the final day			1
only a late burst of madness which saw @entity72 run himself out and @entity42 hit a @entity74 long - hop straight down deep square leg ’s throat spoilt @entity7 ’s day			1
they ended on 373 for six , a lead of 74 , and @entity23 and @entity79 will have to stick around for as long as possible on friday if @entity7 are going to dictate terms			1
@entity7 captain @entity0 hits through the offside as he enjoys some width on day three of the second test against the @entity27 @entity65 cuts before the ball can reach @entity27 captain @entity31 's gloves on his way to 59 runs in the first innings @entity0 congratulates @entity65 on his first test half - century since returning to the @entity7 line - up in the morning session on thursday @entity65 plays the spinner behind point at the @entity93 in @entity94 's , @entity41 , on @entity95 opener @entity65 ducks a bouncer but leaves his bat hanging in the air from paceman @entity99 @entity100 clutches onto an edge from @entity65 off the bowling of @entity74 to end the opener 's innings @entity65 appears disappointed after the conditions appeared to favour the batsmen after they 'd done the hard work early on @entity23 ’s fastest hundred for @entity7 , coming from 125 balls and including 13 fours , two sixes			1
this is his sixth test century for his country			0
his previous high was 87 in @entity113 against @entity114 in 2013			0
in the past year he has scored four test centuries @entity23 is the fifth @entity7 batsman to score six consecutive 50s in @entity118 innings			1
since june 2014 he has scored 1,037 runs , averaging 103.7 @entity23 has featured in five of @entity7 ’s past six test partnerships of 150 - plus runs			1
@entity0 has gone 34 innings and 697 days without a @entity118 ton			2
@entity23 said : ‘ we had a blip towards the end but there is still plenty of batting left in that dressing room and fingers crossed we can kick on			0
build a partnership with @entity133 tomorrow morning and hopefully we get a big score and only have to bat once			0
‘ my movements are very good at the minute			0
you go through blips in your career and the key now for me is to score as many as i can while i have this going for me			0
’ while @entity23 was the star of the day , this was hardly a failure for an @entity7 captain who has now made four scores of 70 - plus in his last seven test innings , but @entity0 would have given anything to have been able to add those extra , elusive 24 runs			1
the brutal reality is that only @entity147 among @entity7 captains and opening batsmen has gone longer without a hundred than @entity0 ’s 34 innings and he had the advantage of being considered the best leader of them all			2
it is now 697 days since @entity0 made the last of his record 25 test centuries , at @entity157 against @entity159 way back in 2013 when everything seemed well with the world of @entity7 and their captain			2
here @entity0 and @entity65 recorded @entity7 ’s first century opening partnership for 31 innings as @entity7 went about their quest for a decisive lead in workmanlike fashion on a slow pitch and an even slower outfield			1
the second - slowest half - century of @entity65 ’s career , which was reached off 137 balls , was also one of the most important for a man who was in almost as great a need of runs as @entity0 after his double failure in @entity179			1
if @entity65 ’s wicket came almost out of the blue when he drove the leg - spin of @entity74 to second slip then @entity0 seemed sure to make this the day when he finally threw off any doubts about him at the helm for another @entity186			2
not only had he been dropped on 29 on the second evening but he survived an lbw shout on 65 on thursday by a whisker when the deserving @entity74 saw his review of @entity190 ’ not out decision deemed umpire ’s call			0
just when @entity0 was looking at his best after lunch , @entity99 went round the wicket , bowled short and wide and somehow forced @entity0 to inside edge an attempted cut into his stumps			0
he stood for a moment , hunched over his bat , before trudging off with a score worth perhaps 20 more because of the slowness of the outfield but one that to @entity0 will seem not nearly enough			0
@entity65 summed up the mood of frustration , saying : ‘ @entity0 and i were really pleased to put on a good start but you do n’t spend all those hours in the nets to get fifties , you go there to get match - defining hundreds			2
’ when @entity211 also chopped on to @entity99 , a sure sign of a slow surface , @entity27 were back in the match and @entity7 ’s nerves were starting to fray			2
yet that was to underestimate the extraordinary potential of the two exciting and prolific young @entity220 batsmen in @entity7 ’s middle order			0
the lack of touch and confidence that @entity36 displayed in the @entity225 now looks light years away as he has returned to the test form that made him the @entity228 ’s emerging player of 2014			0
@entity36 made 122 in @entity179 and carried on here , bringing an urgency to @entity7 ’s innings that was lacking when they managed just 69 runs in an extended morning session			2
@entity0 stands and waits for the result of a @entity27 decision review after an lbw appeal was judged not out by the on - field umpire @entity0 is lucky the umpire gave him not out initially after the ball pitched outside off and hit in line but was only just clipping the stumps @entity0 hits aggressively behind square as @entity100 braces himself at the @entity93 @entity0 checks on the welfare of @entity100 after his well - hit pull shot struck the close - in fielder @entity27 bowler @entity99 is a blur as he comes into his delivery stride on day three of the second test @entity0 's off stump is rattled and the bails fly off after a wide delivery from @entity99 found the skipper 's inside edge @entity99 and his team - mates celebrate as @entity0 leans on his bat in disappointment after being dismissed for 76 @entity0 trudges off the field after a solid innings that ultimately fell short of an elusive hundred for the left - handed opener but if @entity36 was busy then @entity23 roistered along , reaching 50 off 69 balls and 100 off 125			1
he has been a class apart almost from the moment @entity7 recalled him , after leaving him out of the last test of their @entity186 humiliation , and restored him to the middle order where he belongs			0
this was his @entity7 record - equalling sixth successive @entity118 score of 50 or more , a landmark shared with @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 and @entity0 himself			1
no @entity273 has ever made seven in succession			0
at least not until @entity276 bats again			0
together , @entity23 and @entity36 took @entity7 beyond @entity27 ’ score after tea and added 165 before @entity44 found a way through @entity280			1
the late flurry of activity , culminating in @entity42 being given a salute as a send - off by his bete noire @entity44 , reduced @entity7 ’s chances of going to @entity286 next week one up			0
but while there is @entity23 , there is hope			0
a second drag - on for the @entity95 play came for @entity292 4 @entity211 , who also cut @entity99 onto his off stump an annoyed @entity211 has to make the long walk back to the pavilion after being dismissed for a disappointing one run @entity211 inspects the inside edge that orchestrated his downfall in the first innings here after bringing strong form into the match @entity23 came out firing and punished any short deliveries , needing no second invitation to dispatch @entity74 to the boundary onside or offside , it did n't matter for @entity23 as he raced past his half - century , taking full advantage of a tiring bowling attack @entity280 hits the spinner through the offside as he too made the @entity27 pay for wayward bowling @entity280 raises his cherry - covered bat after reaching his half - century , following up his second - innings 122 in the first test @entity23 and @entity36 touch fists as they leave the field with their wickets in tact for the tea interval @entity36 can hardly believe it as he is bowled by a looping delivery from makeshift spinner @entity44 @entity280 looks up in disbelief after his excellent innings comes to an end on 77 runs from 188 deliveries @entity72 fails to get off the mark as he takes off for a single but is rightly sent back by @entity23 @entity31 completed the run - out after the throw from @entity100 as @entity72 's first innings back in the @entity7 line - up ends with a duck @entity42 does n't get a full piece of an innocuous delivery from @entity74 and skies his shot into the outfield @entity42 looks on in hope as his shot floats into the safe hands of @entity100 , who took his second catch of the day after the pair clashed in @entity27 first innings while @entity44 batted , the all - rounder stood a saluted as @entity42 left the field @entity42 looks at @entity44 as the cheeky centurion stands at attention with his hat on his check for the send - off			1

@entity7 are 373 for six at stumps on day three , 74 runs ahead of the @entity27 first innings of *299*
@entity0 ( 76 ) and @entity65 ( 59 ) put on an opening stand of 125 but could n't reach their centuries
no 5 @entity23 was outstanding reaching a century at a strike rate of 80 and was 118 not out at stumps
@entity23 's half - century gave him an @entity7 record - equalling sixth @entity118 score of 50 or more - no - one has seven
@entity36 was out *softly* for 77 after @entity211 played on for one . @entity72 ran himself out for a duck
