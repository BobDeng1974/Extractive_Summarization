secret tapes : @entity1 , a fired @entity3 regulator , recorded meetings which she claims show deferential officials failing to hold banks to account a fired @entity9 regulator recorded hours of meetings which allegedly show how government supervisors were afraid to ask tough questions of the biggest banks on @entity14 @entity1 , 41 , was brought in by @entity16 's banking watchdog in the wake of the financial crisis to tighten the government 's grip on the major banks , and assigned to @entity22			1
and after encountering a culture of ' fear ' and ' deference ' to the finance giants at @entity22 , @entity1 explosively started recording meetings in which regulators offer softball questions to bankers , then congratulate themselves for standing up to them			1
the @entity33 and @entity35 author @entity34 has dubbed the recordings the ' @entity38 video of the financial sector			1
' @entity1 was fired after just seven months working at @entity22 for the @entity3 - which she says was because she refused to back down from a damning report on the bank 's policies on conflicts of interest			1
the tapes , handed over to an investigation by @entity48 and @entity49 , record meetings between where the @entity3 's live - in regulators do not press @entity22 on parts of its dealings which they themselves admit are ' shady '			1
recordings show @entity56 , the @entity3 's top man at @entity22 , gently raising an issue of potential regulatory lapse in a way that allows @entity22 to skirt over it			1
a clause in a deal which @entity56 describes in the tapes before a meeting as ' legal but shady ' seemed to require approval from the @entity3 - which had not been given			1
in the private meeting , @entity56 aims to ' put a big shot across their bow on that '			2
but in the meeting itself - after more than 45 minutes without mentioning it , he only mentions that it ' sounds like ' the clause ' dropped out '			2
he is heard saying : ' just to button up one point			2
i know the term sheet called for a notice to your regulator			0
the original term sheet also called for expression of non-objection - sounds like that dropped out at some point , or ... ? ' refused to toe the line : @entity1 claims she was fired from the @entity3 because she refused to back down over a report which was critical of @entity22 heart of @entity14 : @entity1 made the recordings during her seven - month tenure at @entity22 before she was fired @entity56 is later heard reflecting on the meeting , and says that by asking the question - and even having a meeting in the first place - the @entity3 has succeeded in making @entity22 ' think twice '			1
he says : ' at a minimum , we made them , i guarantee they ’ll think twice about the next one , because by putting them through their paces and having that large @entity3 crowd come in			1
you know we fussed at ‘ em pretty good			0
' soft questions : @entity56 , the @entity3 's top man at @entity22 , is recorded during the tapes he considers sending a letter - which he acknowledges the bank may ignore - but it is unclear whether it was ever sent			1
@entity1 's analysis of the situation is that it shows the @entity3 was in the grip of an irrational ' fear ' of @entity22 which led to them giving the bank an easy ride			1
she told the radio show : ' they were all sort of afraid of @entity22 ... what i was sort of seeing and experiencing was this level of deference to the banks			1
' she is asked whether the attitude amounts to ' regulatory capture ' - a form of corruption when officials put the interests of those they are scrutinizing ahead of doing their job			2
her response is : ' you know , if that is n't [ it ] , i do n't know what is			0
' @entity1 also recorded interviews with her own superiors , in which she is told to adopt a less confrontational style in order to get taken seriously			2
@entity1 filed a lawsuit against the @entity3 , claiming she was dismissed unfairly and demanded $ 7million in damages			1
but her case was struck down by a judge and is now undergoing an appeal			0
@entity22 and the @entity9 declined to comment on the specifics of the deals and exchanges mentioned			2
but in a response to @entity49 , the @entity3 said : ' the @entity9 categorically rejects the allegations being made about the integrity of its supervision of financial institutions			1
' @entity158 ' : @entity1 has now claimed that her recordings show a meek and deferential attitude from government regulators towards the banks they are supposed to be in charge of on the issue of whether it is difficult for regulators to express concerns , the @entity3 said : ' examiners are encouraged to speak up and escalate any concerns they may have regarding the @entity9 or institutions that we supervise			1
' the @entity9 provides multiple venues and layers of recourse to help ensure that its employees freely express their views and concerns ... ' and on @entity180 in particular , it said : ' the decision to terminate ms @entity1 's employment with the @entity9 was based entirely on performance grounds , not because she raised concerns as a member of an examination team about an institution			2
' @entity1 's 46 hours of tapes record conversations between her and superiors at the @entity3 , as well as interactions between @entity22 and its regulators			1
one of the earliest parts relates to a transaction between @entity22 and @entity194 , a @entity196 bank , designed to move shares to help them meet regulations in @entity199			2
@entity200 , the @entity3 's top man at @entity22 , makes the following plan about how to put his concerns to the bank : @entity56 : ' my own personal thinking right now is that we ’re looking at a transaction that ’s legal but shady			1
i want to put a big shot across their bow on that			0
poking at it , maybe we find something even shadier than we already know			0
so let ’s poke at this thing , let ’s poke at it with our usual poker faces , you know			0
i ’d like these guys to come away from this meeting confused as to what we think about it			0
i want to keep then nervous			0
@entity56 : does that make sense ? woman : yeah yeah , it does			0
however , in the meeting , @entity56 does not make his point for more than 45 minutes			0
when he does , he says the following			0
@entity56 to @entity22 bankers : ' just to button up one point			2
i know the term sheet called for a notice to your regulator			0
' the original term sheet also called for expression of non-objection - sounds like that dropped out at some point , or ... ? ' @entity56 , who appears not to get a definitive answer , does n't bring it up again			0
after the meeting , another @entity3 worker is recorded saying the following : @entity3 worker : ' i would add to his comments in that i think we do n’t want to discourage @entity22 from disclosing these types of things in the future , and therefore maybe you know some comment that says do n’t mistake our inquisitiveness , and our desire to understand more about the marketplace in general , as a criticism of you as a firm necessarily			1
' like i do n’t want to , i do n’t want to hit them on the bat with the head , and they say screw it we ’re not gon na disclose it again , we do n’t need to			0
' [ @entity22 are required by law to give the @entity3 any information they ask for ] later @entity56 mentions his performance in the meeting , and says he thinks it will bring about change : @entity56 : ' at a minimum , we made them , i guarantee they ’ll think twice about the next one , because by putting them through their paces and having that large fed crowd come in			1
' you know we fussed at ‘ em pretty good			0
' @entity1 also recorded her superior at the @entity3 - @entity277 - giving her advice on her role , in which he tries to change her attitude			1
@entity277 : i want to manage your sort of career and expectations , right ? i want you to be successful			0
ok ? there are – there 's information that 's coming in , there 's opinions that are coming in			0
right ? ... ' i ’m never questioning about the knowledge base or the assessments or those things , it ’s really about how you are perceived , right ? so if there ’s more a general sort of feedback that says that it ’s not only one person , it ’s not only two persons , but many more people who are perceiving that you ’re – um , you have more sharper elbows , right			0
' or that you ’re sort of breaking eggs			0
and obviously i do n’t know what the right word is			0
' two weeks before she was fired , @entity277 told @entity180 the following : @entity277 : ' couple of things , ok , that i would suggest : have a sense of humility , right ? ' because a lot of the things that you say , and this is the way you ’re coming across , i think i know you well enough that that ’s not what you ’re saying , right ? ' but if i were to be a new person , i would say @entity1 , you ’re very arrogant			2
