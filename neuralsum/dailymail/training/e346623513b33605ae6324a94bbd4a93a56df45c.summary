by @entity0 @entity2 president @entity1 has said the club are in the market for ' a forward and defenders ' as they continue their efforts to sign @entity8 from @entity9			1

arrival : @entity1 , pictured at the unveiling of @entity22 , confirmed @entity2 want a new striker the @entity2 president said : ' we have the names and the players , but sometimes there are clubs who speculate over possible signings by @entity2 to manipulate the price			2
all i can say is that they are names that have been agreed with ( new coach ) @entity36 and they excite us			0
' @entity1 added : ' for example , ( sporting director @entity39 ) @entity38 already has the names of the centre backs although they are not signed yet as there are clubs who think their value will go up after the @entity47			0
' @entity2 hired @entity36 , a former player with the club , to replace @entity49 , who stepped down after a disappointing debut season in 2013 - 14			2
on the move ? @entity9 and @entity2 will open negotiations over the transfer of @entity8 controversial : @entity8 has been linked with a move to @entity2 after being banned for four months the team often looked toothless in attack , despite the presence of @entity58 and @entity59 , and the defence was shambolic at times , conceding far too often from set pieces			1
not only have the @entity11 been linked with @entity8 , centre - back @entity63 is said to be pushing to join from @entity65 rivals @entity66			0
@entity1 said some players would have to leave to make way for new arrivals but left open whether midfielder @entity70 , who at 34 is coming to the end of a glittering career , would play on for another campaign			0
gone : @entity8 ( right ) has been sent home from the @entity47 for biting @entity76 's @entity75 all smiles : this is what @entity8 would like if @entity2 managed to seal his signature from @entity9 swap deal ? @entity2 's @entity82 could be moving in the opposite direction to @entity8 ' he has won the right to decide what he thinks is right and we will help him however he wants , ' @entity1 said			1
' if it was another player we would be the ones saying what he had to do but seeing as it 's @entity70 we are giving him time			0
the day he leaves he will pass into history as the most successful player we have ever had			0
' @entity92 @entity82 is one man who has been linked with a move away from the @entity94 , but @entity1 said that @entity2 were ' counting on him ' for next season .			2
