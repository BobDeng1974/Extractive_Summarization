scientists at @entity1 believe mini doses of @entity3 could help ease the irritability and mood - swings associated with @entity6 mini doses of @entity3 could end the monthly misery of @entity6 , scientists believe			1
they say that the irritability and mood - swings of pre-menstrual syndrome are caused by plummeting levels of a hormone that keep a lid on emotions			1
@entity3 raises levels of this natural sedative and so should stop a woman ’s mood fluctuating in the run up to her period			1
the doses given would be much smaller than those used to treat depression – cutting the risk of the side - effects that have dogged @entity3 ’s use in psychiatry			1
@entity1 researcher @entity30 said : ‘ pre-menstrual syndrome is an enormous problem			1
‘ something like 80 per cent of women suffer in some way			0
‘ and it ’s not just women – it ’s their partners , their families and their workmates			0
‘ it is a terribly @entity42 thing to just brush it under the carpet and say “ it ’s women ’s trouble ”			0
’ ‘ it is caused by hormones and there is something we can do about it			2
’ dr @entity30 , who did her research with colleagues in @entity53 , said that the symptoms of @entity6 seem to be caused by a sharp fall in levels of the hormone progesterone around a week before a woman menstruates			1
normally , a waste product of progesterone called allopregnanolone , or allo , acts as a natural tranquilliser and keeps the brain circuits that control emotions calm			1
when progesterone falls , the amount of this sedative falls and emotions run riot			2
dr @entity30 , who has likened the brain changes caused by lack of allo to those experienced by a heroin addict denied their fix , has shown that @entity3 raises levels of allo			1
given to rats , the drug banished the increased sensitivity to pain and stress they normally occurs at the same point in their cycle as women experience @entity6			0
dr @entity30 says that given to women , @entity3 could ease the anxiety and irritability that often occurs ahead of a period			1
the scientist , who has published her work in the @entity92 , said : ‘ if you have got @entity6 , you get irritated by things that would n’t annoy you at other times			0
’ dr @entity30 hopes the treatment will also ease other symptoms of @entity6 , including bloating and lethargy , but wo n’t know until the drug has been trialled on women			2
she hopes to start tests on women soon			0
regular strength @entity3 lifts depression by raising levels of ‘ feel good brain ’ chemical serotonin but can cause problems from loss of libido to suicidal thoughts and self - harm			1
mood swings are caused by plummeting levels of the hormone progesterone			1
@entity3 raises levels of a natural sedative which controls emotions and so should stop fluctuating moods , the researchers said using much lower doses , around a fifth of those used to treat depression , would not have any effect on serotonin and so the odds of side - effects should be reduced			1
in addition , women would not take the drug every day			0
instead , they take one a day for a week from when they first show signs of @entity6			0
@entity135 , a consultant gynaecologist and spokesman for the @entity137 , said that some doctors already prescribe low - dose @entity3 for @entity6			2
women are anxious about taking the pills but the results have been ‘ fantastic ’			0
but @entity142 , a member of the @entity143 , warned of the possible side - effects			2
she said : ‘ the problem is that when you take medication , you are going to have side - effects			2
‘ with a low dose , side - effects will be less likely but i think most psychiatrists are concerned about medicalising something that you could probably find other ways of managing			0
’ although @entity6 is often viewed as a minor inconvenience , it affects around 80 per cent of women - and up to 40 per cent of those say it damages their quality of life			0
in extreme cases , women can become violent and suffer from severe depression			0
there is also an economic impact , with research suggesting that time off and loss of productivity due to the syndrome annually costs employers around £ 3,000 per female employee .			0
