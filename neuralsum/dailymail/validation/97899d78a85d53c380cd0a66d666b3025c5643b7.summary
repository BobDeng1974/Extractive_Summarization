and in her memoir phenomenal : a @entity31 for @entity32 , which was published on tuesday , the mother - of - one chronicles every aspect of the physical and emotional journey , which , she explains , she began in order to experience the world 's natural phenomena as a part of a spiritual quest to find herself after her son @entity42 , now five , was born			1
@entity15 , who has witnessed @entity46 ’s still - burning volcanoes , @entity48 's intense lightning and @entity64 's aurora borealis - among her many adventures - says the birth of her son in 2009 was as ' awe - inducing and fantastical ' as the natural wonders she describes in her book			1

@entity15 struggled with sleep deprivation , as well as her sense of self , during the first year of @entity42 's life			1
she was only sleeping for three - hour stretches and she refused to allow anyone outside of her immediate family to watch her son for the first 14 months of his life - and even then she would only leave @entity42 's side for a few hours at a time			1
' you know the saying : " it takes a village to raise a child ? " i was n’t letting the village in , ' she recalls			0
adventure time : the 37 - year - old travel writer ( r ) posed with her sled guide ( @entity91 ) in @entity64 for this photo natural wonder : during her trip to @entity64 , @entity15 saw the aurora borealis , or the northern lights and it was n't just her physical ailments that sent caused @entity15 to question her identity as a mother			1
' i had a year where i was convinced that i was never going to leave my house again , [ that ] i was never going to sleep again [ and that ] i was never going to write again , ' she says			0
' i was very confused and i was unsure how my life was going to be			0
’ @entity15 , who first began creating a list of the natural wonders she wanted to experience after watching the fantastical migration of the monarch butterfly in @entity109 in 2007 , before the birth of her son , says she vowed to visit the places she had dreamed of - even if it took her a decade			1
' i had a crazy idea ... and when i started to pursue it , things started to happen and doors started opening , ' she says			0
a few months after @entity42 's first birthday , @entity15 embarked on her first trip , when she traveled to @entity122 to visit the island 's bioluminescent bays , which contain millions of micro-organisms , or dinoflagellates , that glow			1

her story : @entity15 's memoir was published on tuesday the writer explains that during her two year journey she never left her son for more than two weeks , and adds that her husband would travel with her when he could			1
as for any impending danger , @entity15 says she was more nervous about traveling around the bustling streets of @entity165 , @entity48 , than witnessing the @entity168 country 's fearsome lightning storms , because cities make her uncomfortable			2
' we all have things that make us nervous , ' she says , before adding : ' you are more likely to be killed by a coconut falling from a tree than a shark bite			0
' @entity15 believes that her journey ' would be talked about in different ways ' if it were written by a father opposed to a mother – and admits that some people were shocked to learn that her husband was so supportive of her personal journey			2
' i remember distinctly in @entity46 i had a woman say to me : " can you believe that her husband is letting her do this ? " ' she adds that , as a travel writer , visiting those far off locations and writing about her experience was also work for her , rather than just a series of carefree jaunts to exotic locations			2
