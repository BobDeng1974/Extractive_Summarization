experts have called for sugar - laden fizzy drinks to carry warning labels similar to those found on cigarette packets , in a bid to combat the adverse health effects			1
@entity8 assemblyman @entity7 has introduced a bill that will require health warning labels on certain drinks with added sugar			1
it comes after the @entity14 recommended slashing a person 's daily intake of added sugar from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day			1
a regular can of @entity19 contains 35g of sugar , so that alone would exceed this limit			2
the size of the warning , said mr @entity7 , should be dictated by the size of the drink			1
sugar - laden fizzy drinks should carry warning labels to educate consumers that sugar causes obesity , diabetes and tooth decay , a @entity8 politician claims should soda cans carry health warning labels like cigarette packets ? should soda cans carry health warning labels like cigarette packets ? now share your opinion ' we ca n't sit back and pretend that sugary drinks are n't harmful to people , ' he said			1
' we have a public health crisis , which is a direct result of people consuming too much sugar			2
' the research is clear : too much sugar leads to health problems such as obesity and diabetes			1
' as a society , we have a moral obligation to educate people so they can make healthier choices			0
' the @entity56 democrat said the labels should read : ' safety warning : drinking beverages with added sugar contributes to @entity61 , diabetes and tooth decay			1
' mr @entity7 was joined on the steps of @entity65 by representatives from the @entity67 , the @entity68 and the @entity69			2
past research has found sugary drinks are a primary contributor to type 2 diabetes , especially in children			2
in august , the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) reported that 40 per cent of children born between 2000 and 2011 would develop type 2 diabetes in their lifetime			2
experts at the @entity75 estimate 35 per cent of @entity80 are obese , and 69 per cent are overweight			0
obesity is known to cause other serious illnesses , including cancer , heart disease and stroke			0
mr @entity7 said the aim of introducing warning labels on drinks is to educate the public , and lower the consumption of the drinks			1
he likened their goal to that of health campaigners who fought to include warning labels on cigarette packages			1
@entity56 democrat @entity7 has introduced a bill to include the warnings on all sugary drinks ' this is about pragmatic legislation , ' he said			1
' this is not about an attack on an industry for the sake of the industry			0
' this is about doing what 's best for children and adults in our society			0
' we can not afford for our children to continue to be overweight , to continue to have learning problems , to have health problems that may lead to difficult lives and at times illnesses that can lead to the loss of life			2
' mr @entity7 urged the beverage industry to support the bill after they spent $ 13million in @entity122 in 2010 to oppose a proposed penny - per - ounce sugary drink tax , arguing that education is what was really needed			1
assemblyman @entity126 , consumer affairs and protection chair , said : ' studies have established a direct link between consumption of sugar - sweetened beverages and rising rates of obesity , diabetes , and other major health problems in @entity8 and across the @entity80 , which cause thousands of deaths and cost billions of dollars in health care spending annually			1
' we must do everything we can to make the public aware of the serious risks incurred by the over-consumption of sugar			2
' many years ago , when faced with a similarly devastating public health crisis , we chose to place warning labels on cigarettes and other tobacco products to allow citizens to make more informed choices about what they purchase			1
' given the scientific evidence of sugar 's negative consequences for our society , is not only appropriate , but incumbent , upon us to use similar warning labels with sugar - sweetened beverages			1
' nutrition policy consultant said warning labels are a ' smart way to educate consumers about the negative health impacts ' of their favourite fizzy drinks			1
she said : ' right now , the beverage industry bombards our kids with its own messages encouraging constant consumption			0
' in 2010 , for example , preschoolers viewed an average of 213 ads for sugary drinks and energy drinks , while children and teens watched an average of 277 and 406 ads , respectively			0
' @entity179 , from the @entity68 , said the type 2 epidemic in the @entity80 has been ' in part , fuelled by the increased consumption of calorie - dense sugar - sweetened beverages '			2
he said nearly 30 million children and adults in the @entity80 have diabetes , with more than 1.3million in @entity8 diagnosed with the condition			1
the bill comes after the @entity14 recently recommended slashing a person 's daily intake of added sugar from 50g to 25g - or from 10 to five cubes a day another 86 million @entity80 have pre-diabetes , putting them at risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life			1
mr @entity179 said : ' diabetes kills tens of thousands of @entity80 every year and results in disabling complications for thousands of others			0
earlier this year , the @entity14 published draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six			0
the guideline amount slashed was amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco			0
the number of obese @entity211 adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £ 50billion a year			0
the @entity14 said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yogurts , muesli , sauces , fizzy drinks , juice and smoothies			1
however , low - fat foods have also come under fire from experts , after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full - fat alternative			0
who also said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as @entity19 , which contains seven spoons			0
instead five or six teaspoons is the ideal figure that people should aim for			0
' @entity236 supports reducing the consumption of sugar - sweetened beverages through public information , education , and health policy , and applauds assemblyman @entity7 for his interest in warning labels for sugar - sweetened beverages			1
' and the @entity67 echoed mr @entity179 's backing of the bill			0
@entity248 said : ' there is no doubt that consumption of sugary drinks has increased dramatically in recent decades			0
' it is important for our government leaders to work with the public health community to identify , test and implement effective evidence - based strategies to help reverse this dangerous trend			0
' @entity260 supports a comprehensive , multi-pronged approach to combatting obesity which is a leading cause of heart disease and stroke			0
' we are very interested in the proposed legislation by assembly member @entity7 as part of a broad range of public policy approaches addressing the consumption of sugary drinks			2
' the @entity270 told the @entity271 , warning labels will not change consumer behaviour			1
spokesman @entity274 , said : ' obesity is a serious and complex issue , but a misleading warning label on certain beverages will not change behaviors or teach people about healthy lifestyles			2
' there 's a better way to empower consumers to make the choices that are right for them			0
' if we want to get serious about obesity , it starts with education – not laws and regulation			0
