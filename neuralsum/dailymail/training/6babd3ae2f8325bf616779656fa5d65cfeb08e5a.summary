@entity2 38 , who was a @entity10 sergeant at the time , committed the crime after she dialled 999 and he drove her home			1
@entity13 was one of three officers responding to the call from the confused woman who was threatening to take her own life			1
@entity19 ’s @entity18 was told she had taken a mix of drink and medication and just wanted police to take her home			1
having satisfied themselves that she was in no danger , the officers had left her house in @entity30			1
but @entity13 returned , minutes later , when he was sure his two colleagues had driven off and got the woman to perform a sex act on him as he fondled her			1
he was caught out after making what he thought had been discreet admissions to three colleagues - and from @entity38 found at the scene			1
the court was told that at first he denied he had even gone back to the house , and later claimed his victim had ‘ come on ’ to him			1
after the woman made an official complaint , @entity13 used police computer equipment to see how close he was to being arrested			2
@entity13 , who is married with children , later sent a text message to a colleague saying : ' i ’m going to resign			0
it ’s all my fault			0
' jailing him , judge @entity52 said : ' you went to this address as a serving police officer in uniform , with a very high degree of trust placed in you			0
vulnerable : the woman had dialled 999 and had taken drugs and been drinking before @entity13 accosted her ' you abused that trust to take advantage of her vulnerability to satisfy your own sexual needs , and you realised that you might be able to get away with it because of your position			1
' @entity13 - who was in the top three per cent in the country in his sergeant ’s exams - had been arrested on suspicion of rape , but the @entity73 later accepted a guilty plea to a charge of misconduct in public office			0
his victim was described as having a bi-polar illness , which can make her appear at times elated , or in a low mood			2
when officers arrived she was drunk , was slurring her words , and could n’t walk without stumbling			0
when asked why she had not made an immediate complaint , she said : ' who would have believed me ? ' his victim told police that the incident had had a significant impact on her life , she suffered panic attacks , and she could no longer trust police officers			2
@entity99 , defending , said @entity13 ’s greatest shame had been to have been arrested in front of his family			0
his main concern now was the impact on his children			0
judge @entity52 added : ' what possessed you to go back to the address i just do n’t know			0
you knew there were problems , and it should have been a clear red traffic light			2
' deputy chief constable @entity114 , said : ' @entity13 ’s inexcusable actions let everyone down : those that we protect and those that work selflessly to deliver policing across @entity19			0
the sentence given sends out a clear message that society expects the highest standards from those who have a duty to protect them			0

@entity2 returned to the victim *'s* house in @entity30 after he knew that his colleagues had left the scene
the woman had taken a *cocktail* of drink and drugs and just wanted to go home
