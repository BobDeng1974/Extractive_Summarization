by @entity0 for most people , sharks are magnificent creatures – but definitely the sort of beasts you would want to avoid coming into close contact with in a dark corner of the sea			1
in fact , given the chance to get up close and personal with the most menacing of all fish , most of us would say a polite ‘ no thankyou ’			2
and , as this incredible collection of images shows , he ventures where few others would go even with the protection of a shark cage – including within snap - jawed range of great white sharks			1
@entity16 has photographed a whole host of sharks – from great whites and hammerheads to whale sharks – and always at a time when they are at their most ferocious : feeding time			1
a selfie with a difference : @entity16 pops up in shot for this close - up with a hammerhead shark coming right at ya ! @entity16 's knowledge of shark behaviour enables him to capture images in safety by photographing the animals in such a way , @entity16 , 47 , aims to show that the sharks are far more interested in eating fish than they are people			1
in fact , in his 15 years of diving and interacting with these misunderstood animals , this daring @entity61 lensman ’s only near - death experience occurred when his breathing equipment malfunctioned			1
] as this spectacular sequence of images shows , @entity16 calls on his extensive knowledge of the creatures to take the perfect picture of sharks feeding barely inches from his face			1
deceptive : a trick of the camera suggests that this big whale shark is about to devour a nearby snorkeller necessary skills : @entity16 says that ' a deep understanding of shark behaviour is also absolutely critical ' by using a mixture of fish and squid to attract the sharks , @entity16 waits until their mouths are fully extended before taking each shot – and has never once been harmed			1
desperate to show sharks in a whole new light , @entity16 now runs an adventure travel company that brings people face - to - face with the majestic predators			1
‘ i 've swum with countless sharks , and they generally show no aggression towards divers , ’ he says			2
‘ when i do manage to entice sharks close to my camera , they sense the electrical fields surrounding my strobes and lights , but mostly they 're just looking for the fish that they can smell			1

i do n't wear chain mail , but i do wear equipment that is n't shiny or brightly coloured , because i do n't want a shark to think it sees a fish and bite me in its confusion			0
‘ the only near - death experience i 've had was when my breathing equipment malfunctioned 100ft underwater , and i almost did n't make it back to the surface			2
‘ unfortunately , sharks are still portrayed as bloodthirsty monsters by @entity131			2
‘ but , in reality , sharks are the ones that are under threat from us			0
anyone for a swim ? this unnerving picture shows a crowd of sharks waiting under a dive boat ‘ their numbers have been reduced to a tiny fraction of what they once were			0
‘ we are in serious danger of losing some species if we continue to fish for them			0
’ there is , of course , considerable skill to what @entity16 does			2
capturing a shark on camera at just the right moment is , he says , all about the speed of the cameraman			0
‘ it 's very difficult to get a good mouth - gape shot , ’ he says			0
‘ good reflexes and an underwater camera that has a fast - focusing , wide angle lens are both important			0
a deep understanding of shark behaviour is also absolutely critical			0
‘ even among the same species certain sharks have different personalities			0
some get far more excited than others , so it 's very important to read the sharks and pay attention to how each one responds to me			0

fearless lensman @entity16 specialises in close - up shots of sea predators
photographs are taken without any sort of protective device or metal cage
47 - year - old @entity188 says sharks are *beautiful* , and *enormously* misunderstood
