@entity1 laureate and @entity3 survivor @entity0 is lending his support to @entity7 prime minister @entity6 's march 3 speech to @entity8 on the dangers of @entity11 's nuclear program			1
outspoken @entity13 orthodox rabbi @entity12 said on thursday he is placing full - page advertisements in two leading @entity16 newspapers , the @entity17 and the @entity18 , featuring @entity0 's endorsement of @entity6 's speech			1
the advertisement quotes @entity0 as saying he plans to attend @entity6 's address ' on the catastrophic danger of a nuclear @entity11 , ' with the author asking @entity25 and lawmakers : ' will you join me in hearing the case for keeping weapons from those who preach death to @entity7 and @entity33 ? ' the high - profile ad campaign puts pressure on the @entity36 and congressional democrats to rethink their plans to skip the address			1
@entity0 , a @entity40 - @entity16 writer , @entity1 laureate and @entity3 survivor , is weighing in on the split in @entity8 over @entity7 prime minister @entity6 's march 3 speech outspoken @entity13 orthodox rabbi @entity12 is placing full - page advertisements in the @entity17 and the @entity18 featuring @entity0 's endorsement of @entity6 's speech			1
the ad quotes @entity0 as saying he plans to attend @entity6 's address ' on the catastrophic danger of a nuclear @entity11 , ' and asks @entity25 and lawmakers to join him in ' hearing the case for keeping weapons from those who preach death to @entity7 and @entity33 ' speaking to @entity49 by phone , @entity12 said : ' there 's no personality more respected in the global @entity40 community and few in the wider world than @entity0			1
he is a living prince of the @entity40 people			0
' ' he is the face of the murdered 6 million ( @entity40 killed in the @entity3 )			0
so i think that his view on the prime minister 's speech sounding the alarm as to the @entity11 nuclear program carries a unique authority that transcends some of the political circus that has affected the speech , ' @entity12 said			2
@entity12 , the author of books including ' @entity67 , ' was the @entity68 nominee in 2012 for a seat in the @entity16 @entity70 but lost to @entity72 incumbent @entity71			2
@entity0 , 86 , who has written extensively of his imprisonment in @entity75 camps and was awarded the @entity76 in 1986 , is the latest to join a fray that has exposed deep divisions among @entity79 over the policy and propriety behind a speech in which @entity6 is expected to criticize @entity25 's effort to forge an international nuclear deal with @entity11			1
' should we not show our support for what might be the last clear warning before a terrible deal is struck ? ' he asks in the ad			2
' as one who has seen the enemies of the @entity40 people make good on threats to exterminate us , how can i remain silent ? ' @entity96 , the @entity97 , invited @entity6 to appear before @entity8			2
neither @entity96 nor @entity6 consulted the @entity36 before scheduling the visit			0
detractors say @entity6 , who has long warned the @entity100 of the dangers of a nuclear - armed @entity11 , is working with @entity68 to thumb their noses at @entity25 , a @entity103			0
some of @entity6 's critics accuse him of placing ties to republicans above @entity7 's relations with the @entity16 , its most important ally			1
@entity16 - born @entity109 , @entity7 's ambassador to @entity110 , is a former @entity68 political operative			0
this week @entity111 , a @entity72 - leaning @entity112 group , started a petition drive opposed to the @entity7 leader 's speech			0
@entity111 said it had gathered more than 20,000 signatures for a petition asking @entity40 to say ' @entity6 does not speak for me , ' using @entity6 's nickname , in response to @entity6 calling himself not just @entity7 's prime minister but also ' a representative of the entire @entity40 people			1
' prominent @entity40 leader @entity124 of the @entity125 denounced that effort as ' inflammatory and repugnant			0
' @entity128 , president of @entity111 , said @entity16 @entity40 had long been divided , with @entity68 @entity40 backing @entity6 's right - wing government and liberal @entity40 more in line with the @entity7 opposition			1
' perhaps the biggest mistake the prime minister has made is allowing his speech to be the wedge that has driven that argument more public , ' @entity128 said			0
he said about 70 percent of @entity40 @entity16 vote @entity72 and roughly a quarter identifies as @entity68			0
' but today , with a really divided society on both sides of the ocean , both there and here , it is n't possible any longer for there to be a single voice representing the views of all @entity79 , ' @entity128 said			0
the @entity148 lobbying group launched a petition countering @entity111 's campaign , titled ' stand with @entity6 , ' and has promised to publicize which @entity16 lawmakers boycott the speech			2
more than a dozen @entity72 lawmakers have also excused themselves from the remarks , including @entity40 rep. @entity155 , who said in a statement , ' we know what he is going to say			0
' @entity159 , a @entity160 @entity103 and the most senior @entity161 , said this week he would not attend @entity6 's speech either and accused @entity68 of orchestrating what he called ' a tawdry and high - handed stunt that has embarrassed not only @entity7 but the @entity8 itself			1
' @entity166 , the @entity148 's executive director , countered : ' it 's important for the @entity40 community to know that members of @entity8 have a choice ... whether they 're going to stand with the prime minister of @entity7 and the @entity40 community in opposition to a nuclear @entity11 , or whether they 're going to put partisan politics ahead of that and stand with president @entity25			0
' not only will the @entity36 not participate in @entity6 's address to @entity8 , it wo n't entertain him at all while he is in @entity110 that week			2
vice president @entity179 's office has said the vp will be in @entity33 at the time of @entity6 's visit and will therefore be unable to preside over the @entity182 that day			1
president @entity25 has said he wo n't meet with @entity6 during his trip to @entity110 as he feels it would be ' inappropriate ' with an election in @entity7 around the corner .			1
