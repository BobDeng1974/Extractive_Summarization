@entity0 has fired shells into @entity3 waters after their rivals sent more than 100 rounds below the disputed sea boundary during a live - fire drill			1
the heated artillery exchange was prompted by an unusual warning fax sent from the @entity3 to the @entity0 , informing them of their live - fire drill			1
though it is not unusual for the reclusive nation to practice at sea , @entity0 officials were alarmed by the alert , which they claim ' indicates their hostile intention '			1
it comes just days after @entity21 's reclusive nation threatened to launch a ' new form ' of nuclear power tests - and coincidentally during the annual @entity0 - @entity25 military practice , which @entity3 dubs a rehearsal for invasion			1
there were no reports of injuries the heated exchange took place during the @entity47 ' annual military training with @entity0 , which the @entity49 brands rehearsal for invasion according to @entity0 military officials , the @entity49 fired more than 500 rounds during a three - hour drill - 100 of which crossed the border			1
the @entity0 fired back 300 rounds from its k - 9 self - propelled howitzer batteries , and scrambled @entity58 jets			1
residents on the @entity0 island of @entity38 , located in the battle - stricken @entity59 , were evacuated to shelters during the exchange			1
the @entity62 , a maritime border that wraps itself round a part of the @entity49 's coastline , has been the scene of frequent clashes			2
in 2010 , two civilians and two marines on the island were killed by @entity3 military during a border dispute			1
the @entity49 claimed it was provoked by @entity0 military exercises			1
earlier that year , 46 people died off the coast of nearby @entity75 after a warship sank			0
@entity0 claims it was gunned down by the @entity3 , which their rival neighbour denies			2
' the fact that they have sent such a message to us indicates their hostile intention			0
' said @entity85 , a spokesman for the @entity86			0
' the aim is to threaten us and rack up tension on the @entity59 border and the overall @entity91 , ' he said			0
@entity0 military ( pictured ) was alarmed by an early - morning fax from the @entity3 warning them to control their vessels in the region as they would be ' training '			1
though live - fire training is not uncommon , it is unusual for the rivals to warn one another			1
the @entity103 said it showed hostile intentions training : amphibious assault vehicles of the @entity106 were throwing smoke bombs in a drill with the @entity25 where they practised moving from sea to shore			0
but during the morning , more than 100 shells from the @entity3 crossed the border			0
the @entity0 responded by shooting back 300 rounds the @entity49 calls the @entity0 - @entity25 drills a rehearsal for invasion despite the allies claiming they are routine and defensive disputed border : @entity38 has been subjected to numerous bloody naval skirmishes over the years as @entity120 train near the border the message , faxed to @entity0 's @entity125 headquarters at 8am local time , warned officials to control their vessels in the tensely - guarded western sea as they would be conducting live - fire drills later in the day , officials said			1
it stated that all action would be north of the @entity62 ( @entity62 ) , but did not specify what time it would take place			0
@entity136 officials claim the move is an expression of @entity140 's frustration at failing to win outside aid in recent weeks despite numerous attempts			0
and since the @entity144 published a report early this month accusing @entity21 of war crimes akin to @entity147 , the reclusive nation has increased threatening rhetoric and conducted a series of rocket and ballistic missile launches			2
this weekend , tensions rapidly intensified			0
on saturday , @entity3 also accused the @entity0 of ' gangster - like ' behaviour by ' abducting ' one of its fishing boats and threatened to retaliate			2
the @entity103 said it had sent the boat back after it drifted into its waters			0
hours later , @entity140 threatened to conduct a fourth nuclear test at some point			0
after the @entity3 's warning fax early this morning , @entity0 responded that it would react strongly if provoked			1
@entity3 blasted the response , with one military official @entity162 telling the @entity3 's official news agency : ' the boneheads appear to have completely forgotten the fact that @entity38 island was smashed by our military 's bolt of lightning a few years ago			2
' there were no specific targets during this morning 's exchange , and no shells from either side were fired at any land or military installations , claimed an official with @entity0 's @entity178			1
the @entity62 was drawn up at the end of the 1950 - 53 @entity180 - and @entity3 does not recognise it			0
five @entity0 border islands were evacuated as the @entity59 became engulfed by smoke during the drills at noon local time last time the @entity25 trained with @entity0 , the @entity49 sent near - daily threats , including warnings of nuclear strikes against @entity136 and @entity188 the @entity62 was drawn up at the end of the 1950 - 53 @entity180 - and @entity3 does not recognise it the two sides are still technically at war as the conflict ended in a mere truce , not a treaty			1
' it 's up to the two militaries either to recognise or reject their own claimed line , and challenge the other 's - this goes back and forth , so this is probably another episode of that , ' said @entity203 of the @entity204			0
earlier in 2010 , a @entity0 naval vessel was sunk close to the line by what an international commission said was a @entity3 torpedo , although the @entity3 denies involvement			2
today , @entity211 - sung , a resident speaking from a shelter on @entity38 , which is in sight of @entity3 territory , said that anxious islanders were huddled together in shelters			2
@entity211 said he did n't see any fighter jets , but he could hear the boom of artillery fire			0
it is not the first time conflict has broken out during the @entity0 - @entity25 military drills , which the @entity49 calls a rehearsal for invasion			1
the allies say they 're routine and defensive			0
last spring , tension spiked after a near - daily barrage of @entity3 threats , including warnings of nuclear strikes against @entity136 and @entity188 , following international criticism of @entity140 's third nuclear test in february of that year			2
@entity140 routinely test - fires artillery and missiles into the ocean , but it 's rare for the country to disclose such training plans in advance on sunday , @entity140 threatened to conduct a fourth nuclear test at some point , though @entity136 says there are no signs of an imminent detonation but the @entity3 has gradually dialed down its threats and sought to improve ties with @entity0 in what foreign analysts say is an attempt to lure international investment and aid			1
there has been no major breakthrough in the @entity3 's reported push to win outside aid , however , with @entity188 and @entity136 calling on the @entity3 to first take disarmament steps to prove its sincerity about improving ties , analysts say			0
the @entity3 live - fire drills and the country 's hints at a nuclear test are meant to express anger and frustration over what the @entity3 sees as little improvement in progress in its ties with @entity0 and the @entity25 , said @entity272 , a @entity3 expert at @entity0 's @entity273			1
@entity272 said the @entity49 might conduct a fourth nuclear test and launch other provocations to try to wrest the outside concessions it wants			0
the @entity91 remains in a technical state of war because the 1950 - 53 @entity180 ended with an armistice , not a peace treaty			0
about 28,500 @entity25 troops are deployed in @entity0 to deter potential aggression from @entity3 .			2

@entity3 conducted live - fire drill at 12.15 ( *3.15am* *gmt* ) , firing into disputed waters near a @entity0 island
reclusive nation sent unusual ' warning fax ' to @entity0 before military practice , which alarmed officials
when shots crossed border , @entity0 military responded by firing back 300 rounds and scrambling @entity58 jets
heated exchange *happened* during @entity0 's annual training with @entity25 , which @entity49 brands ' rehearsal for invasion '
residents of five border islands evacuated to shelters , in 2010 four islanders were killed by @entity3 military
test - fire drills are normal for @entity3 , but they usually do n't issue warning *ahead* of time
