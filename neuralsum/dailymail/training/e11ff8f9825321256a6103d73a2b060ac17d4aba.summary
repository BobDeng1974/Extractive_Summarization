in 1979 , the year the band released their first single , @entity17 proclaimed : ' we 're not going to let people rip us off , we want the money			0
' @entity17 has often called @entity2 's fifth member , and he has reportedly taken 20 per cent of the band 's income			1
while other bands in the 1960s and 1970s were ruthlessly exploited or suffered at the hands of their larger - than - life managers , @entity60 was scrupulously fair with @entity2 and ensured they were never ripped off			0
a journalist from @entity68 , @entity69 , persuaded @entity1 to become the band 's manager , after they had performed a gig in @entity21 in 1978			1
back then , he was a film technician and his only prior experience was of managing a little - known @entity8 folk band @entity74			0
@entity1 always vowed he did not influence the band 's artistic direction			2
but he did exert some crucial influence in 1981 after @entity17 , @entity23 and drummer @entity26 became born - again @entity79 and told @entity1 the band was finished			2
legends : at the 2011 q awards the band was honoured as the greatest act of the past quarter of a century going global : pictured here in @entity84 , @entity2 have won over audiences around the world wowed at the wall : as a prelude to @entity89 's @entity91 celebrations in 2009 , @entity2 gave a free performance at @entity93 which formed part of @entity95 @entity1 appealed to @entity17 's conscience , reminding him how much other people had spent on their forthcoming tour of the @entity100			1
it worked , and the band went , and kept going back over the years			0
but one piece of @entity1 ' advice that @entity17 has ignored is his view that artists should describe problems , not get embroiled in fixing them			2
@entity17 has lobbied the likes of president @entity110 and @entity111 to urge them to cancel developing nations ' debts			0
but in 2006 it emerged that @entity2 's business transactions had been shifted to the tax - free @entity117 holding company @entity116 - a move @entity1 helped to bring about			1
that revelation left @entity17 open to the charge of hypocrisy			0

distinctive : @entity2 's 2009 @entity127 gig was attended by a record - breaking 88,000 people and featured a giant spaceship - style claw over the stage making music history : @entity17 and bandmates took to the stage for the @entity135 in @entity137 's @entity136 in 2005 that urged @entity140 leaders to cancel developing nations ' debt , improve aid and make global trade rules fairer to poor nations ' it could be seen as slightly poor etiquette for a manager to consider retiring before his artist has split , quit or died , but @entity2 have never subscribed to the rock ' n ' roll code of conduct , ' he told the @entity11			1
' as i approach the musically relevant age of 64 i have resolved to take a less hands - on role as the band embark on the next cycle of their extraordinary career			0
' good causes : @entity17 has been associated with a host of charitable causes			0
but details of @entity2 's tax affairs which emerged in 2006 left him open to charges of hypocrisy @entity10 , which owns @entity168 , is in talks to buy @entity13 's management company @entity170			1
the move will result in @entity13 's manager , @entity12 , taking over the management of @entity2 and day to day running of @entity9 , while @entity1 will become chairman of @entity9			1
@entity10 is due to issue a statement on the deal , which is worth an estimated 30 million @entity100 dollars ( £ 18.7m )			2
what a line - up : @entity2 were the supporting act when the police performed at the @entity180 , @entity181 , in 1982 hair to stay : @entity17 ( left ) shows off his mullet at a 1985 performance in @entity185 in the beginning : @entity2 , young and fresh - faced in @entity21 in 1978 before the big time : @entity17 said at the outset he did n't want anyone to rip them off , and @entity1 ensured that never happened in 2008 , @entity10 struck a deal with @entity2 to handle the band 's touring and merchandising exclusively for 12 years			1
