in @entity50 @entity32 transformed the country 's unofficial national dish of poutine - chips served with gravy and cheese curds - with their own rather messy twist adding a chopped up @entity57 , mustard , ketchup and pickles to the already stodgy mix. @entity16 's all - meat monstrosity was a slab of beef stuffed between crumbed chicken and topped with bacon whopper poutine anyone ? @entity32 's take on @entity50 comfort food is a gravy - covered mess sausage or a pizza ? @entity74 's @entity19 had a sausage roll crust pizza , which came with a cheesy dip @entity32 's restaurants in @entity78 offered customers a beef patty topped with blueberries ( in fruit and sauce form ) and a mushroom waffle - patty hybrid burger served with a side of raw mushrooms			1

the @entity108 crust may have been the cleverest fast food invention we had seen ... or the worst			2
