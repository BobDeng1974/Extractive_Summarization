new double yellow lines painted on the ground in @entity2 are the shortest in @entity3 at just 11 inches long			1
the road markings on @entity5 in @entity6 are designed to separate a residents ' parking zone with a pay and display area and motorists who park on the lines will face a £ 50 or £ 70 fine			1
it has taken over the accolade of @entity3 's shortest double yellow lines from a set also in @entity2 - on @entity19 - which measure just 13 inches			1
the road markings are designed to separate a residents ' parking zone ( left ) with a pay and display area ( right ) the lines have taken over the title as @entity3 's shortest double yellows from another set in @entity2 but residents and motorists say the markings , which are about the same length as two @entity30 6 's , are a ' ridiculous ' waste of time and money and branded them ' pathetic '			1
@entity34 , of @entity35 , parked up next to the line and said : ' it is absolutely ridiculous			0
what a complete waste of time and money			2
i ca n't understand why they even bothered with it			0
' and the question is , are they the exact distance between the residents ' parking bays and the pay and display signs ? because they look a lot wider than that			2
' i just ca n't believe they have spent money on this and wasted time			0
they must have better things to do			0
' but @entity60 chiefs have defended painting the lines			0
a spokesman said : ' although we have seen people try and squeeze cars into unusual places such as pedestrians crossings , we do n't expect anyone to try and park on these lines			0
motorists have branded the lines , which are almost a foot - long , as ' pathetic ' and a ' waste of time and money ' ' this is a genuine attempt to be helpful to motorists by signalling with other signs the divide between pay and display parking and residents ' parking on this street			1
' the lines mark the border between the two types of parking and aim to help drivers park in the right bays and avoid a fine for parking in the wrong one			2
' @entity94 claimed to hold the accolade in 2011 with double yellow lines measuring 17 inches in the city 's @entity97 , while @entity99 in @entity100 came close with its 21 inch lines			1
meanwhile , nine inch - long double yellow lines appeared in @entity103 last year but @entity104 vowed to have them removed from @entity105 the council admitted the lines were a ' mistake ' by contractors and vowed to make sure they were ' corrected ' , it was reported			2
@entity60 has defended the markings saying they are a ' genuine attempt to be helpful '			0
