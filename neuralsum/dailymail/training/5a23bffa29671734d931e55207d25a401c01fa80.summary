by @entity0 another year , another @entity2 captain bidding farewell to north @entity3			2
@entity4 became the fifth current skipper to leave the club in the past nine years when he joined @entity7 , following @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity12 's departures			1
with new captain @entity14 already into the last year of his contract , it does not bode well for the @entity17 's chances of staying at the @entity18 beyond next summer			2
@entity21 's willingness to sell his skippers - assets that should , traditionally , be at the very heart of any football club - betrays the @entity26 's lack of sentimentality , but also the lack of regard in which the @entity2 manager holds the position			1
fresh start : former @entity2 captain @entity4 is presented as @entity7 's latest summer signing sold : both @entity4 ( left ) and @entity8 ( right ) were let go by @entity21 he did not strip @entity34 of the club captaincy last season although the @entity37 made only 21 appearances , initially owing to a stress fracture in his back , while he seemed to think it insignificant that another player , usually @entity14 , would wear the armband on the pitch in the defender 's absence			1
questions about captaincy generally merit one of @entity21 's quizzical looks , as he ponders why people brought up on @entity51 , @entity52 or @entity53 are making such a fuss about an armband on a shirt sleeve			1
old - fashioned though it may seem , you want there to be honour in an individual being chosen to be the captain of your football club			0
at @entity2 , however , the role has been diminished to the point where it was fitting the club ended their trophy drought by winning the @entity70 at @entity71 last may with their long - term captain , @entity4 , as an unused substitute			1
it is not just at @entity2 , of course , but across @entity77 football at many football clubs			2
the @entity81 captain 's armband has long been devalued ; tossed haphazardly between one - cap wonders during dismally dull friendlies or given , sentimentally , to players who have reached a milestone number of appearances for their country			0
this is very sweet , but it shows that , contrary to what we might like to believe , the captain 's armband is ultimately just a piece of cloth tied around a player 's shirt sleeve			0
gone : @entity12 wore @entity2 's captain 's armband before leaving for @entity99 leaving @entity3 : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity100 ( right ) decided to leave the @entity18 for new challenges there are no special privileges for a football captain in the @entity105 , after all , merely an expectation that they work with the referee and take responsibility for their team 's behaviour			1
players look to their manager or coaches on the sidelines for tactical direction , unlike on a cricket pitch , and so a football captain 's role is largely ceremonial or inspirational			0
you would hope it still means something , though , otherwise what 's the point of having a captain at all ? they meet the referee with the team - sheet an hour before kick - off , and should act as a pathway between players and management and , ideally , between the club and its fans			0
this may be as simple as the ghosted , largely anodyne notes that appear every fortnight in the matchday programme under the captain 's name , or fronting up to the television cameras or written press when things are not going so well			0
it could also be things that help make team - mates ' lives easier : @entity148 recalls requesting six new plugs for the players ' baths when he was made captain at @entity153 , to save them trying to clog up the holes with toilet paper			0
captain fantastic : @entity10 lead the @entity158 before swapping north @entity3 for @entity7 in 2011 these varied roles , however , make it a particularly difficult task if the club captain is not a guaranteed starter			1
how can he act as a go - between if he is worried about his place in the squad or not on the pitch at all ? this concern now affects a manager 's choice of captain more than , perhaps , their suitability as a leader			0
some @entity2 fans , for instance , have suggested @entity177 or @entity178 should have been chosen this time around , but their relative youth has prompted @entity21 to look elsewhere			2
by picking talismanic players such as @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity100 to wear the armband in the past , the captaincy became something the @entity2 boss did not really have to think about			1
his captain led the team out , invariably scored or put in a match - winning performance , and that was that			0
when @entity21 abandoned this model , with @entity191 and then @entity4 , the captaincy suddenly became an issue again ; an issue @entity21 does not want or particularly recognise as important in the grand scheme of running a football club			2
consequently , it is not since @entity8 in 2005 that @entity2 have had a captain who really seemed to define the honour , in the traditional sense of how we want our captains to be			1
sadly , that has been sold off a long time ago			0

@entity4 joined @entity7 for *Â£* *15million* last week
he joins @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity12 on the list of @entity2 captains sold
@entity21 has opted to cash in on his skippers over the last decade
@entity14 has taken the armband after @entity4 's departure
