by @entity0 @entity1 : 14:47 est , 24 december 2013 @entity2 : 18:49 est , 24 december 2013 a friend of the disgraced pr executive who became globally notorious following a tasteless tweet about @entity6 has offered a defense of her - of sorts			1
@entity10 said that @entity11 clearly made a mistake when she posted a tweet saying that she hoped she did n't get aids during a trip to @entity16 , but she was ' still figuring out ' @entity17			1
@entity10 called the move ' a failure of judgment and a poor attempt at expression ' in a column for @entity24			0
it caught the attention of reporters during the flight and her company put out a statement before she landed saying that she would no longer be working for @entity43			1
she was on her way to @entity16 to visit relatives as her family had lived in the country until 1994 when her father moved them to the @entity49 , which he said - in an ironic twist - to avoid the racism he felt in @entity36			1
' i interpreted it as a self - deprecating joke about white guilt and @entity58 privilege — about the sheepish feeling of being physically close to tragedy while remaining safe in an economic and cultural bubble , ' mr @entity52 wrote			2
before being fired , @entity11 was the head of corporate communications and had clients that included @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
much of her position at the company involved her dealing directly with reporters			0
@entity52 writes that she straddled the line of being approachable while professional in her work			0
flying into the storm : this photo , snapped by @entity17 user @entity76 , was taken as @entity11 got off a 12 hour flight at @entity36 airport after arriving from @entity35			1
the pr representative would have just been discovering the furor her racist @entity17 had created while she was in the air career suicide : @entity43 says that they will take ' appropriate action ' against the tweet sent by @entity11 ( pictured above in shots from her @entity88 account ) with the high powered executive likely to lose her job before she took down all of her social media footprints following the firestorm when she landed in @entity16 , @entity90 collected a series of her other offensive tweets , proving that she was having trouble understanding the potential backlash			1
' although she 'd been using the service for several years , @entity11 was still figuring out its nuances , ' mr @entity52 said			2
' one thing she 'd notice was that people seemed to like the tweets that were a little bit risque or outrageous			0
' one such tweet came on january 30 , when she wrote : ' i ca n't be fired for things i say while intoxicated right ? ' another came more recently , on october 8 : ' as i sit and eat a bagel with lox , i would like to send love to my jews who are all starving themselves right now			2
you most certainly can : this tweet @entity11 wrote in january may have been a self fulfilling prophecy what a mess : @entity11 will have some explaining to do for her sloppy behavior on twitter @entity11 , who is a @entity16 native , issued an apology but not before her own father greeted her at the airport and said that she was a ' f * * * * * * idiot '			1
she said she was sorry ' for being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not discriminate by race , gender or sexual orientation , but which terrifies us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus , i am ashamed			0
' ' unfortunately , it is terribly easy to be cavalier about an epidemic that one has never witnessed firsthand			0
' ‘ this is my father 's country , and i was born here			0
i cherish my ties to @entity16 and my frequent visits , but i am in anguish knowing that my remarks have caused pain to so many people here ; my family , friends and fellow @entity16			2
i am very sorry for the pain i caused			0
