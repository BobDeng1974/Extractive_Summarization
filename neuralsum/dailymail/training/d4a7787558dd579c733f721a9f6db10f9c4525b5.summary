by @entity0 published : 16:00 est , 13 april 2013 updated : 16:00 est , 13 april 2013 for arthritis sufferers who have pain in their hands , everyday tasks such as tying shoelaces or picking up a kettle can be a struggle			1
but for patients whose condition can not be eased with steroid injections , doctors are offering a radical alternative – finger or thumb - joint replacements			1
although less common than hip or knee - replacement surgery , it can bring the same benefits of pain relief and , potentially , increased mobility			1
‘ the most common cause of stiffness in the hand joints is osteoarthritis and this can be very painful , ’ says mr @entity28 , a consultant orthopaedic hand surgeon at the @entity31 in @entity32			0
pure magic : @entity34 was performing again three months after his thumb operation ‘ in patients for whom other treatments such as steroid injections have been ineffective , surgery is a real option			1
’ osteoarthritis is a condition where the cartilage – a smooth substance that coats the ends of a joint and allows sliding movements – becomes worn away so that bare bone rubs on bare bone , causing stiffness and pain			2
it affects about eight million @entity53			0
one @entity55 patient who has benefited from a new thumb joint is professional magician @entity34			1
although the 58 - year - old from @entity58 , @entity59 , does not have arthritis , he was left unable to move his left thumb after a @entity63 accident with a power drill			2
‘ mr @entity34 ’s interphalangeal joint – the one just below the nail – fused , ’ explains mr @entity28 , who performed the operation			1
‘ the bone grew across the joint , so there was no movement			2
for most people that would n’t be a problem , but for mr @entity34 , it meant that he was unable to perform his intricate tricks			1
to regain movement , his only option was a thumb - joint replacement			1
’ the procedure is the same as that for finger joints			0
first , the ends of two bones are removed with a small surgical saw , via a 3cm incision in the back of the thumb			2
a cavity is then made inside the bone canal – the honeycomb - like inner – for the stem of the implant to sit in			0
this shaft is created with a reamer , a serrated metal instrument the same size as the implant stem			0
a trial implant is inserted first in order to assess movement range , alignment and joint stability			2
once the fit feels right , the trial implant is removed and a sterilised joint replacement is inserted instead			1
mr @entity34 has a one - piece implant – ‘ basically it ’s a silicone hinge that bends when the thumb is flexed and straightens when the thumb is extended ’ , says mr @entity28			1
‘ these implants are generally very safe			0
’ two - piece components made from metal and plastic can also be used but they are technically more difficult to fit , and can not be used where there has been a lot of damage to the joint or bones as they may dislocate			2
the procedure can be done under general or local anaesthetic and takes about 20 minutes			0
mr @entity28 prefers to use a local anaesthetic			0
‘ that way i can ask the patient to move their finger or thumb and ensure there ’s enough movement and stability , ’ he says			0
following surgery , a patient sees a specialist hand physiotherapist to begin a rehabilitation programme , and can usually resume normal activities within six to eight weeks			0
‘ the operation is effective for pain relief and may improve movement , but based on patient data we do n’t promise increased movement , ’ says mr @entity28			0
‘ joint - replacement often preserves rather than improves motion			1
relieving pain is the greatest motivation for this kind of operation as pain makes people miserable and can restrict their activities			0
’ @entity34 , who underwent his procedure in november 2011 , was performing again just three months later			1
he can flex his thumb without pain and is delighted with the results			0
‘ my first thought when the joint fused was how i could do my card and coin tricks , ’ he says			1
‘ during the operation , i felt like crying when i saw the joint moving again			2
now i ’m just so happy			0
