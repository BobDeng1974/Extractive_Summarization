by @entity0 , @entity1 head coach @entity2 has backed @entity3 to become @entity5 's main man after recapturing his spark			1
the striker will lead the @entity5 line again against @entity9 on saturday as @entity10 hunts his first league win			1
he scored twice in @entity13 ' 3 - 0 win over @entity14 on monday and has four goals for club and country this season			1
@entity3 scored in @entity13 ' victory over @entity14 on monday night and @entity2 ( right ) believes he can take that form to lead @entity5 in the @entity21 @entity3 is the only player to score for @entity5 in the @entity21 this season , a double in their opening - day 2 - 2 draw with @entity24			1
they have drawn a blank at @entity27 and in a wretched 3 - 0 defeat at @entity29 , with new Â£ 10million man @entity30 yet to settle and @entity31 lacking match fitness			2
but @entity2 believes @entity3 , who scored just three times after @entity34 last season , can shoulder the goalscoring burden			1
he said : ' i certainly think he can be that frontman			2
he finishes well with either foot and he is one of the players we have got in mind to be one of our strikers			0
' he has come in as a young player to a team where , people keep telling me , there were problems last year but all i have seen is a very mature lad who is a good professional			2
' i have been delighted with him and i 'm excited about the future			0
he can be a top player			2
' @entity3 scored @entity5 's second goal at @entity53 last season in the @entity5 ' away win against @entity55 new signing @entity56 has struggled with a lack of fitness since his move to the @entity61 @entity3 , 21 , is yet to play as a central striker with @entity2 using him out wide due to @entity56 and @entity64 's lack of fitness			1
the summer signings could make their debuts this weekend and @entity10 is relishing the chance to let @entity3 loose in his favoured position			1
' i think his best position is through the middle , he has got good movement and receives the ball well , ' said @entity2 , who spent over eight years at @entity9 as assistant manager and head of youth			0
' he understands , when we do n't have the ball , where he should be and he has a real desire to work and continue to learn			0
' the shame is we have had to play him a bit wider because we have n't had alternatives			0
that 's something we 're getting closer to having and hopefully means we can play our players in the places they want to be			0
' full credit to the lads			0
they have played where they have been asked to and done it to the best of their ability			0
