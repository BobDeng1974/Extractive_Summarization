@entity1 's attacks on increasing privatisation in the @entity3 were undermined yesterday when a @entity5 former health minister said the move is ‘ sensible ’			1
lord @entity7 said his party had expanded the use of private providers in health care – which could not survive without them now			2
insisting the independent sector was now ‘ embedded ’ in the @entity3 , he also warned that tough restrictions planned by shadow health secretary @entity15 may be illegal under @entity17 competition rules			1
@entity1 's shadow health secretary @entity15 insisted he was not scaremongering to win votes his comments come after mr @entity15 yesterday claimed that the @entity3 would be sunk by ‘ a toxic mix of cuts and privatisation ’ under the @entity24 , while @entity1 leader @entity25 said the service would be gone within five years under @entity28 management			1
but @entity28 @entity29 accuse the party of hypocrisy , saying expenditure on @entity3 services provided free by private providers has risen at a slower rate since 2010 than in the preceding four years under @entity1			1
yesterday lord @entity7 , a health minister under @entity36 between 2003 and 2007 , waded into the debate – insisting @entity5 reforms had stopped the scandal of repeated operation cancellations because surgeons were concentrating on emergencies			2
labour leader @entity25 has vowed to scrap the government 's controversial @entity3 reforms if he wins the next election saying independent sector treatment centres ‘ changed the dynamic ’ , he added : ‘ i ’m not a mad privatising right - wing member of the @entity1 – it was about challenging the @entity3 and the way it works			1
i feel that public monopolies need some kind of challenge			2
an extra 1,000 nurses in @entity54 will be funded by a mansion tax on valuable homes in the @entity58 of @entity59 , @entity1 ’s @entity54 leader said yesterday			2
@entity60 said the controversial levy would send £ 250million a year north of the border – even though just 0.3 per cent of the revenue will be raised there			2
he said it enabled him to make a ‘ uniquely @entity1 pledge ’ to increase spending on the @entity3 without having to increase taxes on @entity54			1
he added : ‘ as much as 95 per cent of the mansion tax will be levied in the @entity58 of the @entity70 but its benefit will be felt across the @entity70			0
‘ there is a choice about what we would do with that money raised outside of @entity54 and how we spend it in @entity54			0
’ the proposed tax will target properties valued at more than £ 2million , despite criticism – even from inside @entity1 – that @entity81 and the @entity58 will bear the brunt			0
@entity54 will also be handed a disproportionate share of the takings under the controversial @entity85			0
former labour cabinet minister @entity86 yesterday called the idea an ‘ absurd proposition ’ , while @entity28 mp @entity88 said @entity1 was ‘ selling out the @entity59 ’			0
@entity28 deputy chief whip @entity90 said : ‘ every voter in @entity81 should read @entity1 ’s proposal for a homes tax in @entity81 to pay for the @entity3 in @entity54			1
’ ‘ i ’m simply saying that what we did under @entity36 in bringing in competition was to challenge the @entity3 – it remains a sensible policy			1
’ lord @entity7 insisted @entity1 would have to take @entity17 rules into account before embarking on plans to restrict the freedom of @entity3 providers to commission services from private providers			1
‘ the truth of the matter is that the private sector has not chosen to make any challenge under that , but they could do – and any health secretary would have to deal with it			1
’ the former minister also insisted that wider competition also helped with the ‘ peaks and troughs ’ of demand , especially in winter			0
‘ no one has been able to iron these peaks and troughs at any time since the time of @entity121 , ’ he added			0
the @entity122 , which represents hospital trusts , agreed that the private sector could continue to play a role			1
deputy director of policy @entity127 said was ‘ vital ’ that health bosses should be free to commission independent sector providers where they believe they offer the best service and @entity132 , of health think - tank the @entity134 , said mr @entity15 should focus on securing quality for patients and value for the taxpayer			1
‘ this slight obsession about the private sector seems to be misplaced , ’ he said			1
@entity1 has made the @entity3 central to its election campaign , issuing a poster claiming the health service ‘ as you know it can not survive five more years of @entity146 ’			1
mr @entity15 yesterday denied that @entity1 was scaremongering , claiming that the character of the @entity3 would be ‘ changed beyond recognition ’ if there was more private sector involvement			1
‘ i believe we [ @entity1 ] let the market in too far and it ’s my view that if you carry on with this experimentation with the market in the @entity157 , you will in the end destroy everything that is precious about it			0
’ @entity25 addressing party activists in @entity160 yesterday as he launched the @entity1 's 2015 election campaign oover the next four months , voters will be bombarded with warnings of how the @entity24 ‘ want to cut spending on public services to the levels of the 1930s , when there was no @entity3 ’			1
the line was peddled by @entity25 and shadow health secretary @entity15 yesterday and was also the focus of the party ’s first – highly negative – campaign poster			1
however , the statement is at best deeply disingenuous			0
it is true that the plans unveiled in the chancellor ’s @entity176 would cut public expenditure as a percentage of national income , or gdp , to 35 per cent by 2020			0
and , as an overall share of @entity181 , this would be the ‘ lowest level since the late - 1930s ’ , as the @entity184 acknowledges			0
but @entity1 did not include the ‘ share of gdp ’ caveat , which is crucial			0
in real terms , the amount of money which is actually spent on the public sector , when inflation is factored in – will be reduced only to its lowest level since 2002/03			2
in other words , @entity1 is pretending that returning to the level of spending that took place during the second term @entity199 would inflict devastation upon the @entity157			0
plainly , this is nonsense and does nothing to support @entity1 ’s emotive claim that ‘ the @entity3 as you know it can not survive five more years of @entity146 ’			2
indeed , it is the health service where the cuts will have least impact			2
along with international aid , the @entity3 budget is ring - fenced – and mr @entity210 has found an extra £ 2billion to further fill its coffers			1
by comparison , defence , the @entity212 , the @entity213 and the communities department have seen their unprotected budgets slashed			0
the irony is that , when the @entity24 unveiled their much - ridiculed poster urging voters to stay on the ‘ road to economic recovery ’ last week , @entity1 screamed blue murder at @entity146 ’s claim that the ‘ deficit had been halved ’ – which was itself true only as a proportion of @entity181 , not in cash terms			0
they are now guilty of the same crime themselves			0
at least the @entity24 were trying to deliver a positive message when they were caught out			0
for mr @entity25 and mr @entity15 , the sole intention was scaremongering			2
regrettably , there ’ll be plenty more to come .			0

@entity15 said the *implications* for the @entity3 were ' very serious '
he said the @entity3 was being hit by a ' toxic mix of cuts and privatisation '
but official figures reveal just 6 *%* of the @entity3 budget went to private sector
