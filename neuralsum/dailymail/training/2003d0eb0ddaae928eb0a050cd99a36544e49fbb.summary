' a @entity2 operatives request for an @entity161 gunship to take down a @entity46 mortar position was denied inferno : armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate 's exterior siege : the compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack , which lasted several hours ' this happened within a few hours and it was really over before , you know , we had the opportunity to really know what was happening , ' said @entity118			1
furthermore , @entity53 has learned that there were two military surveillance drones above the skies of @entity7 during the attack which would have been able to relay real time visuals of the assault to @entity6 officials in the @entity188 situation room and the @entity189			1
@entity47 and another former @entity190 were killed by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. @entity46 time , over six hours after the attack began and just one hour after relief from an @entity6 @entity195 sent from @entity196 had arrive			2

@entity25 supporters have in turn accused @entity203 of making unfounded accusations in an effort to score political points from the death of a @entity6 ambassador and the three others killed in the @entity7 attack			2
flames , grenades and gunfire : a burnt - out car in front of the @entity6 consulate the @entity223 , @entity203 @entity224 , asked in a letter to @entity25 on thursday about whether military options and assets were offered ' during and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack			2
