the heat is on and there are contrasting statements from some of the @entity5 ’s most prominent managers			2
@entity6 loftily announces that he has no need to win trophies to keep his job at @entity10			1
@entity11 openly admits that unless he had put @entity12 back in the running for honours he would have been sacked			1
@entity15 urgently instructs his @entity17 players to minimise passes back to their goalkeeper in an attempt to pacify fans who are demanding a return to the attacking style of sir @entity24			1
@entity6 claims he does not need to win trophies to hold on to the @entity10 reins @entity15 has told his players not to pass back to keeper @entity28 to improve @entity17 's tempo @entity30 airily falls back on the support of his chairman @entity32 as @entity34 drift , as if rudderless , towards the rapids of the drop zone			1
get real , @entity38 and @entity30			1
right on , mister @entity11 and @entity39			1
@entity40 has never been a recipe for security in the football management game and you begin to fear for @entity6 and @entity30 as the season heads towards the home straight			1
@entity6 ’s calm intelligence and fine football principles have won our admiration but he is kidding himself if he truly believes it when he says : ‘ i ’m not under any pressure to win titles			1
it ’s about playing with style			2
it ’s not about my relationship with the owners			2
they are not so desperate to win			1
’ oh , really ? good luck with that one if after they spend so much money you come up short of @entity64 in your defence of the @entity5 title and @entity67 finish you off in the @entity68			2
and it did n’t look that good against gallant @entity70 on wednesday night			2
@entity30 comes across as honest – albeit painfully so at times – as well as a smooth media operator but he may be taking a little too much for granted when he says : ‘ i was always aware of the support i would get from the chairman			1
’ @entity30 has suffered second season syndrome at @entity34 with the @entity34 perilously perched @entity11 was candid about his chances of survival before @entity12 's remarkable turnaround beware the good old vote of confidence , @entity30 , and let ’s hope you do n’t come to re-evaluate something else you ’ve just said about mr @entity32 : ‘ @entity84 is a mad @entity34			1
’ @entity86 fans are not usually very forgiving of only one win in a run of a dozen games including that tepid defeat at @entity91			1
@entity11 and @entity39 , meanwhile , are sensibly watching their backs			1
not long ago i had occasion to chide @entity11 in this column for doing too much talking about himself but seemingly not enough work on a @entity12 team sliding into crisis			1
since then he has seen the warning signs and cleverly switched to a positive 3 - 4 - 3 formation which has turned them into the form team of the @entity5 and he freely declares now : ‘ i ’ve learned that if the team is not functioning it does n’t matter how much support you have in the boardroom			1
’ so it ’s well done to him			2
since losing to @entity17 on december 14 , @entity12 have won nine and drawn three in the @entity5 @entity39 is proving himself shrewd enough to know that sometimes not even a run of only two defeats in 21 matches is enough at a club as huge as @entity17			1
the @entity114 faithful are chanting ‘ attack , attack , attack ’ while his raft of expensive imports – including £ 60million record signing @entity119 – are struggling to comes to terms with the quick - fire culture of the game in @entity123			0
and the manager hears them : ‘ i agree with the fans that we do n’t have to use the goalkeeper so much			0
that there are times when we could play at a higher tempo			1
’ @entity17 are approaching a potentially season - defining sequence of matches against @entity138 , @entity12 , @entity10 and @entity64 in the @entity5 and @entity139 in the @entity141 quarter - finals and he promises : ‘ we can improve			1
’ so it ’s well done to him , too			0
this quartet are not the only managers sweating in the boiler room of big - time football			0
@entity148 knows , for example , what poor old @entity150 was burbling on about in his bottle - kicking rant during @entity154 ’s fractious draw at @entity155 this midweek			0
or whether his sanity will hold up under the pressure of fighting to stave off relegation without his star @entity123 winger @entity160 following his arrest on suspicion of having sex with an underage girl			0
@entity119 trudges off to be substituted after another disappointing outing against @entity166 @entity155 boss @entity167 and @entity154 's @entity150 played down their spat and have since shaken hands the trapdoor is beginning to creak under some auspicious names			2
do n’t feel too sorry for them if it swings open			0
unlike the great managers of yore – even sir @entity24 was financially strapped in his early years astride the hot seat – these celebrities are paid millions to cope with the pressures			0
like several of their more immediate predecessors , they would not necessarily be obliged to find another job after the pay - off			2
it ’s mostly the pride that ’s in danger of being hurt			0
there is one lesson above all others which @entity123 ’s rugby goliaths need to heed from that @entity192 defeat in @entity193			0
@entity194 alone will not be enough to win the @entity195 this autumn , even on home turf			2
@entity198 ’s pack is a monster , right enough , but you can not simply shove , bore and batter your way to glory against the best teams on the planet in the test matches which matter above all others			0
@entity123 will need more than a game based around brute force if they are to succeed in the @entity195 @entity193 gave @entity210 his men a lesson and the @entity213 will need to regroup - and add guile you have to play some football , at least , when it comes to @entity193 , probably @entity218 , even more so @entity219			0
sir @entity220 had @entity221 the enforcer but he also got the sparkling best out of @entity224 , whose phenomenal kicking blinded many to his creative talents			0
@entity198 has @entity210 the @entity228			0
he also has at his disposal the mercurial genius of @entity231 , who he leaves parked on the bench			0
there is no reward without risk			0
there was an awed reaction to my reminiscence earlier this week of how @entity138 ’s late , great @entity241 refused to believe he had broken his left leg for a second time until he stamped his foot and the jagged white bone stuck out through his sock … then spurned the stretcher and insisted on walking off			0
so do n’t be too surprised if this much loved and revered iron @entity249 arrives at the funeral on his own two feet			0
the late , great @entity241 is crowned by @entity138 team - mate @entity252 after winning the 1967 @entity141			0

@entity6 announced that he does not need to win trophies to keep his job
@entity30 *continually* announces that he has the support of @entity32
@entity11 was realistic enough to know that results needed to improve
@entity39 is trying to improve @entity17 's tempo by minimising *backpasses*
