renowned : @entity0 wrote celebrated poems such as the soldier the myth paints him as an @entity5 hero and a romantic symbol for a lost generation			1
but a new book about @entity0 ’s affair with suffragette @entity10 reveals the shocking truth about the poet a century after his death			1
he was a celebrity of his age , lauded by @entity17 as among ‘ @entity19 ’s noblest sons ’ , and described by @entity20 as ‘ the handsomest young man in @entity19 ’			2
but the writer of celebrated poems such as @entity24 is now shown to have been a fierce opponent of women ’s rights who privately declared , ‘ all women are beasts ’			1
the book , @entity30 : the @entity31 of @entity0 and @entity10 , draws on forgotten letters between the pair , as well as @entity10 ’s unpublished memoir			1

the normal is to love and marry one person , the wandering is to take what one wants where one finds it , to be friends here , lovers there , married there , to spend a day with one , a week with others ’			0
