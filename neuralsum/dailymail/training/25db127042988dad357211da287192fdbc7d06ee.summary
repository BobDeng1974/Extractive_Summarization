by @entity0 published : 20:03 est , 10 november 2013 updated : 20:03 est , 10 november 2013 @entity1 : father - of - four @entity2 , computing academic of @entity4 , tweeted one person : ' i am amazing , and not just at @entity7			1
though perhaps you were referring to the retail store			1
' one ’s a @entity12 department store gearing up for @entity7 with a huge advertising campaign – the other is an @entity15 computing professor			1
guess which @entity2 was contacted by the public to say they loved the £ 7million seasonal commercial ? step forward mr @entity2 of @entity20 , @entity4 – who now has 4,500 followers on @entity22 after the advertisment premiered in the @entity12 on saturday night			1
the @entity15 academic uses the @entity22 identity @entity26 – for which he bought the rights before the store chain – ensuring that he bore the brunt of the messages from customers			1
but instead of blowing a fuse , he has been unfailingly polite to the thousands who have mistakenly contacted him via the social networking site , earning him praise online as ‘ the most patient and polite man on the internet ’			2
store bosses last night promised to send a gift to thank the professor for redirecting people to the correct @entity22 page , which is @ johnlewisretail			1
mr @entity2 , a father of four children aged seven to 14 , said : ‘ so many people use the internet and @entity22 to say vile things			2
i ’m quite happy to be known for a polite reply			0
’ in response to one query from a @entity22 user called @ richardbarley , he replies with subtle humour : ‘ i am amazing , and not just at @entity7			1
@entity57 perhaps you were referring to the retail store			2
’ following another admiring message from a pair of users , he responds : ‘ i am a perfect combination of those things , but you probably meant the retail store			2
’ some even wrote back to compliment mr @entity2 on his ‘ charming , witty work ’			0
one , @entity65 said : ‘ all these tweets that he receives from people thinking it ’s the store and he responds with such wit			0
mr @entity2 , 50 , who writes university and school text books on computer science , had heard of his namesake store following visits to the @entity12			0
he has also seen the new commercial online and , like millions of others , was charmed by the tale of a hare and a hibernating bear			0
until saturday night , he only had 500 @entity22 followers – and the occasional erroneous message from customers of the store			0
moving : @entity111 has recorded a @entity113 cover for the new commercial which debuted on saturday now he has lost count of the number of tweets he has received about the hugely popular animated promotion			0
he has replied to ‘ almost all ’ of them – often with an injection of wit – but his family find it ‘ amusing ’ that he spends so much time responding			0
‘ i do n’t know how they will feel if i keep it up until @entity7 , ’ said mr @entity2			1
‘ we shall have to see , but i know i will always be polite			0
