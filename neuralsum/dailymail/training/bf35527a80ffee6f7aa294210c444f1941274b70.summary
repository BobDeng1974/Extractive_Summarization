@entity0 may have ditched @entity1 but there is no guarantee that it means they will now be playing the dynamic , @entity6 style one - day cricket that has enthused the rest of the cricketing world			1
@entity9 understands there is just as much chance of @entity12 , reprieved in the @entity14 squad at @entity1 ’s expense , walking out to open the batting with @entity17 against @entity18 at @entity19 on february 14 as there is the more explosive @entity21			1
@entity0 do not think their tactics are wrong going into a @entity14 but more that @entity1 was no longer the right man at the top of the order to fulfil them			2
@entity1 , meanwhile , revealed he was devastated to miss out on a place in the @entity14 squad			0
speaking on saturday , he said : ‘ i am gutted to be left out of the @entity14 squad and it is likely to take me a while to get over the disappointment			0
that said i wish @entity46 , @entity31 and the lads all the best for the @entity14			0
i would also like to thank all the players and fans who have supported me as one - day captain			0
’ @entity9 understands @entity12 has as much chance as opening the batting as @entity21 at the @entity14 @entity1 after the defeat by @entity30 , his final match as @entity0 one - day captain			1

@entity1 was sacked as @entity0 's odi captain last week
but that does *n't* mean @entity0 will start playing dynamic cricket
@entity12 has just as much chance as @entity21 of opening in february
