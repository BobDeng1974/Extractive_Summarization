by @entity0 published : 18:15 est , 9 december 2013 updated : 07:20 est , 10 december 2013 elderly savers are being stripped of thousands of pounds by middlemen when they retire , a report claims today			1
they are handing big chunks of their pension pots to insurers , brokers and financial advisers for transfer services they assumed were free			1
losses on a £ 100,000 fund can be as high as £ 6,000			0
every year , more than 400,000 retirees turn their pension pots into an income for life – an annuity – in a business worth £ 12billion			1
a report by the @entity20 found that many pension brokers baffle savers with jargon and retirees are being stripped of thousands of pounds for services they assumed were free half stay loyal to the insurer they have saved with while others turn to brokers in search of a better deal at a time of rock - bottom rates			1
but the report from the @entity20 – an arm of the @entity38 regulator – found that many of these middlemen baffle the pensioners with complicated jargon followed by hard - sales tactics			1
some savers are duped into believing the transfer service is free by misleading small print on the brokers ’ websites			1
in four out of 15 cases examined by the consumer panel , firms claimed there was no charge			0
however , the pensioners were charged between £ 1,500 and £ 3,350 for moving their £ 100,000 pot. in some cases seen by the report ’s authors the fees were as high as 6 per cent , or £ 6,000 – although it is unclear whether all the money came from customers ’ pockets			1
@entity63 , a pensions campaigner and former saga chief , said : ‘ pensioners are being thrown to the wolves			1
they are being left to fend for themselves in what is basically a retirement minefield			0
many savers are handing big chunks of their pension pots to insurers , brokers and financial advisers and losses on a £ 100,000 fund can be as high as £ 6,000 ‘ it is the only time most of these people will have to buy a pension and often they know nothing about how the process works			1
the insurers , brokers and advisers know however exactly what they are doing			1
‘ it is utterly unfair one side has all the power and knowledge , while the other is all too easily misled			0
’ in some cases , brokers and advisers had lucrative tie - ups with panels of favoured insurers			1
these meant they received their cut from a pension pot without bothering to scour the market for the best place to park their client ’s life ’s savings			1
a poor choice of annuity provider can leave a saver lumbered with inadequate payouts until they die			0
often , elderly savers who thought they were contacting an insurer or broker for help were instead unwittingly handing sensitive information to marketing companies			1
their details were then sold on at a profit to insurers , brokers and pensions advisers who then bombarded them with calls , letters and emails			1
@entity122 , pictured with his wife @entity123 , was put off buying an annuity because of the high fees @entity122 was put off buying an annuity with his £ 37,000 pension pot by the hefty fees charged by some online brokers			1
the 65 - year - old retired logistics manager from @entity131 tried to ask for quotes from three different broker firms operating online			2
because he has motor neurone disease , mr @entity122 was seeking an income for life that pays out more to the sick			0
this is known as an enhanced annuity			0
however , he was put off by the high fees that brokers demanded			2
these would have taken up to £ 1,000 out of his pension pot. finally , after more than six months of searching through a variety of firms , he found that his £ 37,000 would not buy him enough of a pension to make it worth his while			1
in the worst quote given to him by a pensions company , he was offered only £ 2,218 a year			0
somebody in his condition should have expected to be receiving much more – up to £ 3,500			0
he said : ‘ they were not very upfront about how much it would all cost			0
‘ it was all buried in the small print			0
i felt at the end of the day they were taking too much from my pot for doing too little			0
’ mr @entity122 has now taken other occupational pensions for his income			0
these often vulnerable customers were frequently left so terrified by endless uninvited emails and calls they decided to stick with their old insurer – leaving them at risk of receiving a poorer deal			0
@entity169 , one of the report ’s authors , said : ‘ retirees are being left to cope with what is a complete lottery			2
‘ they have no idea about how complicated the whole process of buying an annuity can be until it is too late			2
’ the report found many retirees ' are being left to cope with what is a complete lottery ' @entity183 , a spokesman for the trade body , the @entity185 , said : ‘ the industry is determined to ensure that people can access the help they need to make the right pension choice for them			1
‘ we welcome moves to improve standards for non-advised sales through intermediaries , and to improve access to advice more generally			2
’ @entity198 , head of pensions research at @entity200 , said : ‘ for many people , the retirement process and in particular the purchase of an annuity is one of the most significant financial transactions they will undertake			2
‘ the challenge is to make that process as effective as possible			0
’ mr @entity198 said shopping around at retirement for the best rate and the best income ‘ should be the default option for everyone ’			0
he said more than half of pension pots were worth less than £ 20,000			2
customers with smaller funds find it difficult to obtain paid - for financial advice			2
advisers can instead direct them towards a non-advice product , which may pay the adviser a commission			0
pitfalls can potentially include pensions offering good retirement incomes but stopping at death , meaning a spouse is left without an income – a drawback which may not be spotted without professional advice .			0
