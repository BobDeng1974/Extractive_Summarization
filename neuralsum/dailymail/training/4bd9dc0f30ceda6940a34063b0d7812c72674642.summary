by @entity0 last updated at 1:06 pm on 30th september 2011 a council is spending more than £ 100,000 of public money on texting congratulations to people who recycle properly			0
the money will be spent on sending ' positive messages ' and ' interesting recycling facts ' to @entity9 residents who manage to put out their bins on the correct day			1
but the scheme has been branded as ' patronising ' amid suggestions that targeting those who already do the right thing is a waste of money			1
rubbish collection : @entity18 will reward those who put their bins out on time with a congratulatory text or email @entity23 , @entity18 's environment boss , said : ' this has the potential to make a real difference ' the news comes the day after the government announced that it would set aside £ 250million to fund weekly bin collections			0
@entity18 won a pay - out of £ 110,000 from the @entity31 to pay for the scheme			1
those who sign up to it and regularly put out their recycling on the right day will receive congratulatory texts or emails from the council to reward their behaviour			1
the council insists that making local people ' more involved in the recycling process ' will boost recycling levels and make refuse collection work more efficiently			1
money from the scheme comes from a special @entity31 fund of £ 500,000			2
more than 70 local authorities applied for funding , but @entity18 was awarded more than a fifth of the money available			0
the council says its texts and emails to recyclers will contain ' a positive message related to their participation ; a positive message related to levels of participation within their area ; a reminder sent the day before recycling collection due ; information regarding what can and ca n’t be recycled ; or interesting recycling facts			1
' but @entity65 , campaign manager of the @entity66 , said : ' it 's great to see councils working to make recycling simpler , but it need n't cost a small fortune			1
' ensuring information about collection dates is easily available is a positive way to encourage recycling , but it 's a little patronising to send congratulatory messages			1
' however , @entity18 insists that the scheme will be effective			2
councillor @entity23 , its environment boss , said : ' this has the potential to make a real difference to the borough 's recycling rates , and will encourage a lot of people who are n't currently recycling to do so			2
rewarding : the council will contact people by phone or email to say well done the evidence from previous studies shows that this sort of scheme can go a long way to changing behaviour both individually and in a community			2
' also , because the texts will make people who receive them more involved in the recycling process , i hope it will encourage them to act as champions in their area			0
' a spokesman claimed that this method of encouraging recycling was ' at least as effective as door - stepping ' and ' much more cost - effective '			0
without a concerted effort to reduce residual waste and drive up recycling rates , disposal costs could increase by £ 7million to £ 23million in four years , the council said			0
a @entity31 spokesman said : ' rewarding and recognising people for doing the right thing can encourage a range of positive behaviours , including recycling			0
' more than half of us would recycle more if we were given a reward , or were recognised and thanked by the council for our effort			0

messages will include ' interesting recycling facts '
@entity66 *criticises* ' small fortune ' spent on scheme
