by @entity0 published : 17:20 est , 15 may 2012 updated : 17:45 est , 15 may 2012 approval : people with @entity3 's have been left waiting for years to receive new drugs on the @entity5 it is claimed because the rationing body is bogged down in other tasks patients are waiting up to nine years for cancer and @entity3 ’s drugs to be available on the health service because approval takes so long			1
the delays mean that even new drugs given the all - clear in extensive trials remain stuck in the queue for years			2
a major study found that on average it takes five years from a treatment ’s launch by a manufacturer to approval by the rationing body , @entity24			1
but the process often lasts far longer , and on occasions @entity24 will not even start its assessment until a drug has been on the market for more than a year			2
one of the problems is that @entity24 – the @entity24 – has a wide - ranging remit which includes drawing up @entity5 guidance on tackling obesity , alcohol abuse and other public health issues			2
but last night doctors and charities said it was unfair that patients were being denied potentially life - saving drugs just because the rationing body is bogged down in other tasks			1
they said the delays are affecting patients ’ quality of life and could make the difference between someone being able to live independently or needing full - time care			1
although patients can get drugs that have not yet been approved by @entity24 by paying privately or applying to the @entity53 , doctors are often reluctant to prescribe them			1
the report by the @entity55 , obtained by @entity56 , looked at all the drugs approved by @entity24 since 2000 , covering a total of nearly 300 treatments including those for cancer , alzheimer ’s disease , and heart problems			1
when making its decisions , @entity24 classifies drugs into two groups			2
those which would be used on their own undergo ‘ single ’ appraisals , while those which are taken with another drug are subject to ‘ multiple ’ appraisals			0
these take several years longer			0
delays : a major study found that on average it takes the @entity5 rationing body @entity24 five years to give approval to a treatment after its launch in 2010 , the most recent year for which figures are available , the average delay for the 11 drugs which were approved after multiple appraisals was 10.2 years			1
they included treatments for arthritis , hepatitis c and @entity87 ’s disease , a debilitating bowel disorder			2
the average delay for multiple drugs given the green light in 2005 was 8.7 years			0
they included treatments for bowel cancer ( irinotecan and oxaliplatin ) and cancer of the womb ( topotecan and pacilitaxel )			0
in 2006 @entity24 approved three @entity3 ’s drugs , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102 , although only for patients in the ‘ moderate ’ stages of the disease			1
these treatments would have been classified as multiple appraisals , and that year the average time these assessments had taken was 7.8 years			2
delays : patients can get drugs that have not yet been approved by @entity24 by paying privately or applying to the @entity53 , but doctors are often reluctant to approve them last night @entity113 of the @entity114 said : ‘ people with all types of dementia desperately need effective treatments to live a better quality of life and stay independent for longer			1
‘ five years is a long time to wait			0
whenever a new drug is available , @entity24 guidance should be issued as quickly as possible			0
’ @entity124 of @entity123 said patients needed effective drugs ‘ swiftly ’ and added : ‘ there needs to be a balance between giving @entity24 enough time to make the right decisions and ensuring that drugs get to patients as soon as possible			1
’ dr @entity133 , a senior gp in @entity134 , said : ‘ being too busy to appraise a drug is not acceptable			0
’ @entity24 ’s role includes drawing up public health guidelines such as how @entity5 trusts should tackle obesity			0
it also sets ‘ quality standards ’ which state how patients with a range of illnesses should best be treated			0
earlier this year the watchdog took on yet another role and began drawing up guidelines on social care			0
it will shortly be issuing advice on how @entity5 staff should care for the elderly with dementia and vulnerable children			0
a spokesman from @entity24 said : ‘ we do n’t recognise most of the conclusions reached by the @entity158 report which was published in january this year			0
‘ the report includes in its average figures some drugs that received their licences many years before @entity24 was established in 1999			1
‘ @entity24 has since been asked to appraise such drugs , but their inclusion in this report has skewed the average length of time elapsed from marketing authorisation to published @entity24 guidance quite considerably			1

rationing body @entity24 is *denying* potentially life saving drugs because it is bogged down in other tasks , doctors claim
delays can make the difference between someone being able to live independently or needing full time care
some treatments for @entity3 's , arthritis and hepatitis c delayed for more than a decade on average
