@entity0 starred with the ball on the first day of @entity3 's warm - up match in @entity4 , but it was the runs of @entity7 and @entity8 that pleased him most			1
@entity3 dominated against a modest @entity9 , dismissing them for a paltry 59 inside 27 overs and then compiling 181 for one in reply			1
the quality of the home batsmen made the first innings seem like little more than a glorified net session , though @entity0 still impressed with a lively spell that yielded three wickets for 10			1
@entity7 plays behind square on his way to an unbeaten 95 in the tour match against a @entity4 ' xi @entity7 and teammate @entity8 talk in between overs during the @entity4 and @entity22 game more important for @entity3 's test prospects , though , was the stand of 158 between @entity7 ( 95 not out ) and @entity8 ( 72 )			1
both men needed the comfort of big runs , @entity7 having been axed from the one - day side on the eve of the @entity32 and @entity8 on his first @entity3 appearance since november 2013 - a period that has seen him battle a case of situational anxiety			1
he now has the chance to nail down the role of @entity7 's opening partner and made a solid start in admittedly favourable circumstances			1
' @entity42 and @entity43 gave them nothing and it will stand us in good stead for the test matches , ' said @entity0			2
@entity0 spoke strongly about his team - mates after the two batsmen looked assured at the crease @entity0 had earlier taken three for 10 in an impressive spell with the ball , as @entity3 dominated the day ' the biggest thing for a batsman is time out in the middle			1
you can do all the training in the nets you want but nothing quite compares to a game and they both did that well today			0
@entity42 has been great , it is almost like he has n't left			0
to see him go out and score some runs , the way he has been known to for @entity3 over the last five years , was really good to see			2
' @entity0 arguably went over the top in his assessment of @entity7 's knock , but with the captain having come under pressure for his lack of major scores , it could yet prove an important effort			1
@entity0 described his captain cook as one of the best players in the world after his return to form ' it was fantastic for @entity43 too , ' said @entity0			2
' he 's been out of the game for a while so to come in and look like the one of the best batsmen in the world , like he once was , was great			2
the tempo he played at was fantastic and any bad ball he managed to put it away , which was good to see			0
' for his part , @entity0 looks a certainty to return to the @entity92 side in the @entity93			2
having announced himself as an all - rounder of unusual promise in the 2013 - 14 ashes , he saw his glittering rise checked by struggles for form and fitness for long periods last year			0
he did not even make the cut for the @entity32 but now has a chance to prove his credentials once again in the longer form			0
@entity8 plays to the offside to reach his fifty during the @entity4 and @entity3 tour match ' it was nice to make an impact back in the first game , even if it was just a warm - up game in an @entity3 shirt , ' he said			1
' i still had the nerves there and it was pretty pleasing to do well			0
' i 'm still working very hard on getting back into the team , which is what i want to do			0
hopefully that is just the start			0
' i need performances to back that up			0
to keep my place i know i need to keep performing , which is something i have n't been consistent with since @entity126 so hopefully i get a chance in the @entity92 matches here and i can build on that			0

@entity0 took three wickets for 10 runs as @entity3 ***bowled*** @entity133 out for just 59 in tour match
@entity7 ( 95 *** ) and @entity8 ( 72 ) made big opening stand
@entity0 *praised* batsmen , particularly ' one of the best in the world ' @entity7
