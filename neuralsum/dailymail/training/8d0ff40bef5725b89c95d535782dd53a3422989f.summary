@entity0 are considering celebrity options to present their @entity3 coverage in april following @entity5 ’s defection to host the @entity6 for the @entity7 on the same day			1
possible names include @entity9 , host of a confrontational daytime chat show that focuses on relationship feuds , and football and @entity15 presenter @entity14			1
@entity16 , the regular racing anchor in @entity5 ’s absence , has won many awards			0
but he is not considered a big enough name for the @entity22 showcase because the @entity3 attracts a much wider once - a - year audience than the normal racing programming			2
but to have such a newcomer presenting the race will not go down well with @entity38 diehards , especially on such a prestigious occasion			0
at least @entity14 has experience of live sports presenting , though not in racing , and working on the @entity3 requires extensive knowledge of the race			2
a @entity46 spokesman said that no decision had yet been made on the @entity3 presenter .			0

@entity0 want a celebrity to host this year 's @entity3 in april
@entity5 will appear on the @entity7 to host the @entity6 on same day
football presenter @entity14 also in *contention* to host coverage
