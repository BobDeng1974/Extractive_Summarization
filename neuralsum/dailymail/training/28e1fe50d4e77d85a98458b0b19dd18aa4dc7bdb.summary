@entity0 with @entity1 , head of the @entity2 , responsible for the death , disappearance and torture of tens of thousands of @entity6 in its so - called @entity7 the @entity0 has been accused of failing to stand up to the brutal military junta that slaughtered tens of thousands of @entity6 in its so - called @entity7			1
critics say @entity0 did little to help those who disappeared when the country was under right - wing military rule – and too much to criticise the left - wing opponents of the generals			1
he has even been accused of turning a blind eye to the rounding up and torturing of his own @entity17 priests , something he strongly denies			1
the baggage of @entity6 history also means potential diplomatic difficulties for @entity22 over the @entity23			0
at a mass in @entity27 last year , on the 30th anniversary of the invasion of the @entity23 , the @entity0 referred to the @entity22 as ‘ usurpers ’ and called for the @entity6 dead to be thanked			1
he said : ‘ we come to pray for all who have fallen , sons of the homeland who went out to defend their mother , the @entity33 , and to reclaim what is theirs , that is of the @entity33 , and it was usurped			0
’ ‘ @entity36 can not exclude from its memory , anyone who was called ; it has to take charge of so many hearts with scars , and say thank you to them , to those who stayed on the island or those submerged in the water , to all of them			0
’ at another anniversary service in 2008 , he referred to those who sought to ‘ de-malvinise history and reality ’			0
@entity0 was the rector of an @entity6 seminary at the time of the @entity55 in 1982			2
however the most damning criticism of the new @entity0 comes from the @entity6 human rights lawyer @entity57 , who has accused him of allowing his own @entity17 priests to be rounded up and tortured by the junta death squads , and of failing to intervene when families begged him to help find babies kidnapped by the regime			1
@entity0 was head of the @entity63 in @entity6 in the 1970s as the @entity7 began , first under the ageing @entity65 and later under the military junta			1
miss @entity57 said that church leaders knew what was happening in the @entity7 , yet backed the regime			2
‘ the dictatorship could not have operated this way without this key support , ’ she said			0
the @entity0 has been charged by critics with failure to confront a regime that killed its opponents , including not only left - wing guerillas but thousands of students and others considered ‘ politically unacceptable ’			1
newly elected pope @entity0 appears on the balcony of @entity80 after being elected by the conclave of cardinals , at the @entity83 @entity6 soldiers , still with their weapons , waiting to be moved from @entity87 airport shortly after the surrender of the @entity23 to the @entity22 forces the period became a by - word for brutality , with thousands of families suffering the disappearance of loved ones and the adoption by the armed forces of murder methods such as throwing detainees out of aeroplanes			1
one form of torture for families was the kidnapping of babies of mothers murdered as enemies of the regime and their adoption by families approved by the military dictatorship			0
the bishops of @entity6 , led by @entity0 , published an apology in october last year in which they acknowledged that the church had not protected its faithful			2
however the statement still blamed leftists as well as the junta for the killings			0
pope @entity0 , seen here conducting a mass in honour of @entity123 in @entity27 cathedral in 2005 , denies turning a blind eye to the torturing of @entity17 priests the bishops appealed for information about where bodies had been buried or knew identities of stolen babies to come forward			1
however the apology came too late for liberal and left critics			0
they point to @entity0 ’s refusal to give evidence in open court on the events of the 1970s until 2010 , when his answers were considered evasive by some			2
he is also accused of failing to prevent the torture of two of his own @entity17 priests , @entity143 and @entity145 , both supporters of left - wing liberations theology who were seized by the regime in 1976			1
however supporters of @entity0 say he took risks behind the scenes , including visiting the home of dictator @entity1 to say mass and appeal for mercy			1
the two men were released and @entity0 did not discuss the incident until 2010			2
the new @entity0 is said by supporters to have worked regularly and at some danger to himself to curb the excesses of the military			1
@entity0 is also accused of failing to help a family whose baby was stolen despite appeals to do so from @entity164			1
the family have called his attitude ‘ cowardly ’			0
@entity166 , whose family helped launch the @entity169 in the final years of the junta , said : ‘ he does n’t face this reality and it does n’t bother him			0
the question is how to save his name , save himself			0
but he ca n’t keep these allegations from reaching the public			0
the people know how he is			0
’ @entity0 has stood out strongly against the current government of @entity178 , saying last year that @entity6 was suffering from demagoguery , corruption and efforts to re-establish authoritarianism			2
