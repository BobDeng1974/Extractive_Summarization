astronomers have , for the first time , detected in x-rays a planet outside our solar system pass in front of its parent star			2
the image was taken of a planet in @entity10 - a system which is 63 light - years from @entity12 - using @entity14 ’s @entity13 and the @entity16 ’s @entity15			1
up until now , exoplanets had only been observed passing in front of their parent stars using optical light in a process known as transiting			0
the image was taken of the @entity10 system which contains a @entity33 - like star orbited by the blue hd 189733b , an exoplanet about the size of @entity37 ‘ thousands of planet candidates have been seen to transit in only optical light , ’ said @entity38 of @entity39 ( @entity39 ) in @entity40 , @entity41			1
‘ finally being able to study one in @entity29 is important because it reveals new information about the properties of an exoplanet			0
’ the planet , known as @entity51 , is a hot @entity37 , meaning it is similar in size to @entity37 in our solar system but in very close orbit around its star			1
it is more than 30 times closer to its star than @entity12 is to the sun and orbits its star once every 2.2 days			1
the planet is a huge gas giant and its atmosphere is scorching , with a temperature of over 1,000 ° @entity65 the observations , made using @entity14 's @entity13 ( pictured ) , could be the first time such a collision has been detected in x-rays type : ' @entity72 ' gas giant distance from @entity12 : 63 light years temperature : 1,000 ° c wind speed : 7,000 kilometres per hour conditions : glass particles in the atmosphere give it its dazzling blue colour @entity14 believes it is the closest hot @entity37 to @entity12 , which makes it a prime target for astronomers who want to learn more about this type of exoplanet and the atmosphere around it			1
last month , the @entity87 determined the dazzling blue colour of the alien planet for the first time as a result of the scattering of blue light by silicate particles in its atmosphere			2
it found that it rains glass - sideways - in howling 7,000 kilometre - per - hour winds			1
the latest observations by @entity13 have allowed researchers to learning about how the planet and the star can affect one another			0
this illustration shows @entity51 , a huge gas giant that orbits very close to its host star @entity10			1
the planet 's atmosphere is scorching with a temperature of over 1000 degrees @entity65 , and it rains glass , sideways , in howling 7000 kilometer - per - hour winds astronomers have known for about a decade ultraviolet and x-ray radiation from the main star in @entity10 are evaporating the atmosphere of hd 189733b over time			1
the authors estimate it is losing 100 million to 600 million kilograms of mass per second			0
hd 189733b 's atmosphere appears to be thinning 25 per cent to 65 per cent faster than it would be if the planet 's atmosphere were smaller			2
an x-ray image shows the main star ( middle )			0
the source in the lower right is the faint companion star			0
the source at the bottom of the image is a background object not contained in the @entity10 system ‘ the extended atmosphere of this planet makes it a bigger target for high - energy radiation from its star , so more evaporation occurs , ’ said co-author @entity135 , also of @entity39			2
the main star in @entity10 also has a faint red companion , detected for the first time in x-rays with @entity13			0
the stars likely formed at the same time , but the main star appears to be 3 billion to 3.5 billion years younger than its companion star because it rotates faster , displays higher levels of magnetic activity and is about 30 times brighter in x-rays than its companion			2
‘ this star is not acting its age , and having a big planet as a companion may be the explanation , ’ said ms @entity38			0
‘ it 's possible this hot @entity37 is keeping the star 's rotation and magnetic activity high because of tidal forces , making it behave in some ways like a much younger star			0

@entity51 is 63 light - years from @entity12 and orbits its star every 2.2 days
it is over 1000 ° c and rains glass in 7,000 kilometre - per - hour winds
@entity174 may be evaporating atmosphere of planet faster than first thought
