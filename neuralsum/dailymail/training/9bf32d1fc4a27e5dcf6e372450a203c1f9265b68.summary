@entity0 celebrated success in his first derby match as a manager @entity4 as @entity5 blew away neighbours @entity6			1
@entity0 knows a thing or two about local rivalries thanks to his four years in charge of @entity10 and whatever he said at half - time in @entity12 did the trick			2
goals from @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 in 15 second - half minutes gave the hosts three points to heap pressure on @entity6 boss @entity21			1
@entity15 scored his first goal for @entity5 to give @entity0 's side a well - deserved lead in the second half @entity16 doubles @entity5 's lead with a well - timed header from @entity29 's cross @entity17 's penalty sends @entity31 the wrong way after @entity33 was brought down in the box @entity5 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity29 ( @entity42 ) , @entity17 , @entity15 , @entity43 subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 booked : @entity41 goals : @entity52 , @entity16 , @entity17 @entity6 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity31 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ) , @entity58 ( @entity59 ) , @entity60 ( @entity61 ) , @entity62 , @entity63 subs not used : @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 booked : @entity53 , @entity57 , @entity69 goals : @entity63 att : 17,282 ref : @entity71 @entity72 winger @entity69 , booed for his decision to again not wear a poppy on his shirt , set up @entity63 's consolation goal for the visitors as the pressure increased on manager @entity21			1
@entity21 has been in charge of @entity6 for 11 months and after signs of promise last season , in particular an eight - match winning run in february and march , a better start to his first full campaign in charge was expected			2
@entity0 has now won four of six matches since taking the helm at @entity5 last month			1
what his time as @entity10 manager did not prepare him for was being at the wrong end of the table			0
but @entity5 are now above @entity6 and out of the relegation â€“ at least until 4.45pm on saturday			1
the problem for both sides has been scoring goals and each of these clubs had scored just 17 goals in 16 matches before kick - off			0
@entity6 's rotten luck in front of goal was evident twice in the opening ten minutes			1

@entity63 then went close himself			2
he drifted in from the left wing and let fly from 30 yards but saw his effort clip the top of the cross bar with @entity5 keeper @entity35 well beaten			2
it was a breathless first half , punctuated by moments of fleeting quality			0
@entity5 fashioned their first sight of goal midway through it when @entity17 's through ball released @entity15 but @entity128 was equal to the shot with a solid save			1
@entity6 's early menace faded as the half wore on but they sparked back into life in first - half stoppage time when @entity63 was unlucky not to put his side ahead			1
this time popping up on the right - hand side of the penalty area , the 23 - year - old shifted the ball on to his left foot to shoot only to see his low curling effort strike the outside of the post			2
@entity6 were punished within five minutes of the restart			0
@entity15 headed the ball down to @entity17 , whose return pass sent the striker clear and his finish through the legs of @entity31 was befitting of an old pro. @entity6 forward @entity63 shows a turn of pace to burst past @entity39 on friday night @entity41 tries to fend off @entity6 midfielder @entity58 during their championship clash @entity15 puts in a heavy challenge on former @entity10 forward @entity112 @entity6 were punished for their wasted chances as @entity5 struck two hammer blows inside the opening ten minutes of the half			1
@entity15 headed the ball down to @entity17 , whose return pass sent the striker clear and his finish through the legs of @entity31 was befitting of an old pro. @entity6 were reeling and the second goal arrived when @entity29 's high cross was powered in by @entity16 ' header and @entity164 's miserable night got worse when his push on @entity33 led to a penalty , which @entity17 converted coolly			1
the reception was not welcoming for @entity69 when he entered the fray as a substitute , but the @entity171 - born wide player provided a rare moment of quality for the visitors			0
his first telling contribution with the ball gave @entity6 's fans something to cheer			2
the @entity72 crossed from the left and @entity63 finally added a finish that did not come back off the woodwork			2
@entity6 manager @entity21 and his @entity5 counterpart @entity0 instruct their teams from the sidelines @entity5 goal scorer @entity15 is challenged by @entity6 forward @entity186 the @entity5 team and mascot observe the one minute silence before the game at the @entity110 @entity6 midfielder @entity69 was booed for choosing not to wear a poppy on his shirt @entity21 issued a damning verdict of @entity6 's second - half capitulation , calling the performance ' embarrassing ' and accusing his own players of giving up			1
he said : ' second half , i have to be honest - @entity5 won the game by pure willpower , desire , energy , going to the limit and forcing the issue , forcing the mistakes and forcing the goals - all credit to them			2
' we just folded altogether			0
and for that i have no understanding whatsoever			0
i 'm not blaming anybody but when we analyse the second half , we gave up			0
i apologise to the chairman , i apologise to the supporters			0
' it 's very , very seldom in the last 10 years that i had a team who gave up in the way we gave up in the second half			0
' i felt embarrassed by the performance that we have given in the second half			0
' i 'm not sure that meant as much for some of my players as it meant for our supporters and for our chairman			0
' in any competitive game of football you never give up , you always fight to the end			0
to give up at @entity5 in the second half in a derby game - it is unforgivable			1
' @entity6 were leapfrogged by @entity5 , who began the evening in the bottom three , and there is a very real possibility that @entity239 , 18 months removed from winning the @entity240 , head into next week 's international break in the second tier 's relegation zone			1
when asked whether he feared chairman @entity245 could be searching for a new manager over the next fortnight as a result , @entity21 replied : ' you 'll have to ask the chairman			0
i am fearless , but there 's always a risk when i started ( as a manager ) 10 years ago and it is still the same			0

@entity63 hit the woodwork twice in the first half
@entity15 scored his first goal for the club to give @entity5 the lead
@entity16 doubled the @entity263 ' lead , @entity17 scored a penalty
