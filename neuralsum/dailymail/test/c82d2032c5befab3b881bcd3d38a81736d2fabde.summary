groups of football fans are responsible for thuggish behaviour on trains on a weekly basis , a senior police officer has said			1
the warning by @entity7 ( @entity7 ) chief constable @entity8 came ahead of a summit organised to determine the scale of the problem , which has come under scrutiny in recent months following a number of high - profile incidents			1
the latest figures for this football season show that @entity7 has recorded 630 football - related incidents so far , including a number with a racial element			1
five @entity22 fans were caught on film directing racist abuse towards a black passenger in @entity26 fans appeared to be chanting on the @entity29 train : ' we 're racist , we 're racist and that 's the way we like it ' mr @entity8 said : ' sadly this type of casual thuggery is occurring just about on a weekly basis on our trains , with a sizeable minority who are behaving in a threatening , loud and sometimes racist way to the great terror of people who are using the system to get about and do their day - to - day business			1
' he said the impact on ordinary passengers is ' unacceptable ' , adding : ' we are in danger of saying those types of experiences are ok			0
' is that the sort of society we really want ? i do n't think it is			0
we have n't solved this type of behaviour and we need to work together to change it			0
' we are saying ' why do people think this is acceptable on trains ? ' you do n't see this sort of behaviour on an aeroplane , for example			2
' police believe the scale of football - related crime on the transport network may be higher than the figures show			1
mr @entity8 said : ' we think it is under - reported and we think that might be because people are intimidated or frightened			1
' supporters have come under scrutiny ( none of the fans pictured are necessarily referred to in the story ) he said the problem was a ' very complex issue ' and required a cultural change			2
' what i am not looking for is more of the same , ' he said			0
' i do n't think it is an issue we can arrest our way out of			0
' representatives from football , police and other organisations , as well as those affected by football thuggery , are attending the summit , which is the first of its kind			2
