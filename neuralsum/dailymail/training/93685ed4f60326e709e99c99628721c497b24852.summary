another @entity1 contestant has claimed she heard a fellow competitor name the pageant 's finalists before they were announced , reigniting the debate over whether the competition was rigged			1

the latest accuser , who has spoken on condition of anonymity , said miss @entity11 had appeared ' very , very flustered and upset ' as the top 15 girls were announced			1
now another contestant has said she heard the same ' i thought it might be because she did n’t make the top 15 cut , but at that point she was able to reveal to me at least four of the five names who went on to be the top girls , ' the contestant told @entity35			1
' she could n’t remember the fifth because she was so upset			2
several of the girls then started hearing through the grapevine about a list ; a lot of people were upset			1
' she added that she would stand by @entity8 , who is being sued by @entity44 co-owner @entity43 over her claims			1
' a lot of the girls now are very upset about how @entity8 is being treated and aggressively attacked by an organization that claims to empower women , ' she said			1

' after the @entity79 were called and we were standing backstage she hesitantly said to me and another contestant that she knew who the @entity83 were			2
i said ' who do you think they will be ? ' she said that she did n't ' think ' she ' knew ' because she saw the list that morning			2
' she relayed whose names were on the list			2
then we agreed to wait and see if that was indeed the @entity92 called that night			0
after it was indeed the @entity83 5 i knew the show must be rigged			2

' but @entity11 has also come forward to deny she made the claims seriously			2
' backstage during the pageant , i did see a piece of paper with names on it and like most people in such frenetic circumstances , joked that they must be the names of the final contestants , ' @entity11 said			0
' it was a throwaway comment , in the stress of the pageant , and was never meant as fact			0
the list i saw did n’t even have the eventual winner on it			2
