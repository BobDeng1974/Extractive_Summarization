for many tattoos are highly personal decorations , often a remembrance of an event or a person or a rite of passage			0
tattoos are usually applied using an electric needle inserting indelible ink into the skin			2
in @entity11 , however , there is a dying art of tattooing whereby they are applied with a traditional method known as ‘ hand - tapping ’			1
in this technique the tattooist uses a short wooden stick fitted with a needle to insert the ink			1
the needle bounces in and out of the skin as the first stick is rapidly hit with another			0
this is done with help from another tattoo artist who holds and stretches the area to be tattooed			0
there are some tattooists determined to prevent the art becoming extinct and one , @entity32 , allowed these photographs to be taken of their work and their subjects to bring them to a wider audience			0
it is a technique that has vanished in most places but is still in use in @entity40 and the @entity41 but other tattooing traditions are found in @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46			0
it has @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity50 roots			0
there are a variety of hand - tapping tools including those made by the @entity55 and @entity57 peoples of east @entity40 , sometimes using materials such as ulin , one of the hardest timbers in the world			2
traditional tattoos in @entity11 have particular shapes that relate to each tribe 's heritage			1
