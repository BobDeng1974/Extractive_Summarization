the media were banned from entering the @entity2 hotel in @entity3 after the @entity4 started filming in the lobby , but the @entity7 tv station which did gain access later may be a lot more troublesome			1
it was @entity7 station @entity11 — who have just revealed a serial doping culture in @entity16 athletics that has caused tremors within track and field ’s ruling body , the @entity19 — and they had two of their top officials operating inside @entity25 hotel			1
@entity11 , who have the @entity27 , the @entity28 and the @entity19 all mounting probes into the drugs allegations , are planning a documentary about @entity2 and the @entity33 bids			1
tv station @entity11 are making a documentary about @entity35 ( right ) , who is under investigaion @entity35 originally declined to talk to @entity36 ( above ) before changing his mind the central figure within the @entity11 probe is expected to be @entity7 legend @entity35 , the former @entity2 member who remains under investigation by @entity2 for alleged breaches of ethics codes in the bidding process			1
@entity35 initially refused to speak to the @entity36 investigation before changing his mind			1
he has had close links with the @entity16 bid team since the campaign in 2010 when @entity48 first mooted he would become an ambassador of @entity16 energy giants @entity50			1
they have since become major sponsors in football			2
the biggest surprise in @entity36 ’s resignation statement was his astonishing claim that the @entity2 had reported him to the disciplinary committee for supposedly breaking ethics codes by speaking out that his report should be made public			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			2
. @entity62 ’s weekly chat show on @entity63 , which attracts paltry viewing figures despite huge promotion , could be sold to @entity4			2
talks are understood to be at an advanced stage for a 30 - minute version of the programme featuring @entity62 to be aired on @entity70 on friday evenings			2
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			2
. @entity2 ’s @entity71 fails to register in the @entity72 even when @entity73 — with @entity74 and @entity75 part of a full strength side — are playing in today ’s final			1
however , @entity2 ’s individual @entity79 is regarded by the world ’s best players as definitely worth winning			1
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity82 needs training up the @entity2 circus in @entity3 this week has seen @entity72 vice-president @entity85 inundated with media requests which the affable @entity88 football administrator always does his best to accommodate — even waiting for 40 minutes while @entity89 tried to sort out an interview link from @entity91 yesterday			1
certainly , @entity93 ’s @entity92 , almost sure to replace @entity85 after the @entity96 @entity95 election in march , will have to change his typical @entity98 attitude and needs media training to prepare him for the role			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. @entity102 ’s ever - increasing media profile has been enough to persuade @entity103 to join him in the management stable of @entity105 , the former @entity106 player still unkindly described by fan groups as the club ’s worst - ever signing			0
... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...			0
. the @entity110 board were remarkably sanguine at their meeting this week about the commercial department ’s abject failure to find a sponsor for the @entity115 by the third round			0
sympathy of the sort shown by the @entity110 directors about the difficult market conditions certainly would not have been seen at @entity121 – run @entity122 , where heads tend to roll in the @entity125 commercial department for failure to achieve targets			0
@entity125 chairman @entity121 is known to be rather more cut - throat than the @entity110 seem to be it is expected that the upcoming @entity131 tv rights bonanza , that could reap an astonishing near £ 5billion from the domestic market with a £ 10million - a - game valuation , will galvanise campaigning about lowering the price of match tickets			0
the @entity131 , despite all the billions coming into the coffers from television contracts , still need full stadiums to sell the product			0
there can be no reason whatsoever after the jackpot rights deals are announced in february for ticket prices at all @entity146 clubs not to come down .			0

@entity11 are the same station which exposed @entity16 doping culture
the @entity7 channel are making a documentary about @entity2
the programme will be *focussed* around @entity35
former @entity7 legend is being investigated by *governing* body
