by @entity0 @entity1 has revealed his wish to retire as a @entity4 player , ideally with the parting gift of one last top - flight winners ’ medal as he plans to plunder more prizes before hanging up his shooting boots			1
the 34 - year - old is back with the club for a third spell this summer and would like to make his return signing the 10th and final move of his nomadic career			1
@entity1 flew out to @entity16 on saturday as @entity18 ’s squad embarked on a four - game @entity20 tour that will take the striker back to @entity23 , where he starred for @entity24 in a previous pit - stop			1
old boy : @entity1 is back with the @entity28 club for his third spell in a @entity4 shirt for @entity1 , though , there is no place like the football home that he regards as @entity28			1
yet this is no comfort zone for the former @entity36 international , who stresses his ambitions stretch further than helping hoist @entity4 into the @entity39 next may			2
he would love to finish his playing days with his current employers and , feeling fresh into a new pre-season , has no interest in setting a time limit on that			1
so he still has a top - flight title challenge within his career compass and a desire to add to the three @entity50 medals he won for @entity4 back in stint two under @entity52			1
@entity1 ’s motivation on the first step towards that goal is to contribute sufficiently to a successful promotion campaign against former club @entity57 and @entity58 so that he earns the optional year on his new @entity4 contract			1
he ’ll then take aim at bigger prizes			2
‘ you never know because if they kick me out of the door at @entity4 after a year , i ’d imagine i ’ll still want to play on , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ but it would be my intention to finish up here			2
i ’ve got a year with a year option , depending on games			1
so it ’s pretty much on me			2
reunited : @entity71 is back at @entity4 too and will look to forge a potent strike pairing with @entity1 ‘ as long as i ’m fit , playing and performing then , hopefully , it will turn into another year			1
it ’s going to take a good season this year for us to get there and then obviously some serious competition next year to get back challenging			1
‘ but that ’s the aim for me anyway — to be back at the top of @entity81 football where we belong			1
to top things off would be to win the league back in the @entity39			1
‘ @entity4 should n’t go in to any competition thinking of accepting second best , so that ’s what we ’ll be aiming for next year if we get there			2
‘ i hope to be around for that			2
i want to play as long as i can			2
i feel strong and fit right now			2
of course , only time will tell if the performances follow but , if i do that , then there ’s no reason why i ca n’t be around for a bit longer			2
’ home : @entity1 has spoken of his delight as he starts his third spell at @entity28 after the pre season break the highlights of @entity1 ’s 67 goals in 147 appearances so far for @entity4 were in @entity50 and @entity104 competition			1
the second tier of the @entity81 game , though , is nothing new to him			1
as an @entity109 teenager , he played seven games either side of a loan spell at @entity113 as @entity57 bounced back at the first time of asking in 1998/99			1
@entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118 were among the heroes of @entity121 ’s team that year as crowds flocked back to @entity123 to see a team canter to the @entity126 title			1
not since that campaign has there been such a buzz about the division now known as the @entity131			2
as @entity1 recalls the year that one of the traditional top - flight teams had to claw their way back up , he admits he ca n’t wait to sample the curiosities of a season like no other as three giants of the game collide in an unfamiliar environment			1
poacher : @entity1 slides home the first goal of his @entity4 return during pre season ‘ i made my debut the season @entity57 got relegated and made a few appearances while the team was promoted , ’ he said			1
‘ it was a big season for me			0
they brought @entity116 and @entity115 — that pair must have sold 5,000 tickets alone each week , given the standard of players they were			0
‘ @entity57 had a fantastic season			0
to draw those players to the club was phenomenal and what they went on to do was amazing			0
‘ a winning team on the pitch can create a fantastic atmosphere within the club and the crowds were up			0
i can see big crowds and huge games in this division			0
it ’s going to be a fantastic season and one i ’m really looking forward to			0
‘ to come back to @entity4 not in the top division is incredible in itself but for @entity58 and @entity57 to be there also is phenomenal			2
i never thought i ’d be back playing against them in the @entity131			1
‘ it will be a competitive league and a big challenge for us			0
but it ’s a challenge i feel this squad probably needs after the last couple of years			0
‘ no disrespect to the opposition @entity4 have been facing but i feel the challenges coming our way this year will really raise the standards of the players we ’ve got			2
’ welcoming : @entity1 is looking forward to coming back to the place he calls home - @entity28 @entity1 and strike partner @entity71 were reunited last weekend as both players got off the mark on a two - game @entity183 tour			1
the next phase of pre-season will involve the long - haul journeys to which he was accustomed as a @entity188			2
after games on the west coast of the @entity191 against @entity192 and @entity193 , @entity1 returns to @entity194 for a game against @entity196 a week tomorrow , before the final game with @entity198 on july 23			1
he called @entity200 home for two years after joining the @entity202 side from @entity203 midway through their 2012 season			0
under the @entity81 coaching team of @entity206 and @entity208 international defender @entity207 , @entity1 helped guide @entity24 to a first - ever appearance in the @entity211 play - offs that year			1
strike : @entity1 will be hoping he can provide the scoring touch that will oust @entity214 from the @entity81 summit however , he admits there were facets of professional life in @entity23 that he found difficult to embrace			1
‘ if you are a guy like myself who if he does n’t win the weekend is ruined , then that side is not there so much , ’ explained @entity1			1
‘ you see others who do n’t have that			0
it ’s not that they do n’t care — far from it — but just not as much as i did			0
‘ in @entity36 , you lose and you do n’t want to go out			0
it ’s straight home on a saturday , a @entity229 and the @entity232			0
here we live , breathe and eat football			0
across there , it ’s not quite as life or death as it is for us			0
i found that mentality towards it a bit hard to get used to			0
‘ this is not any slight on anyone i played with			0
it ’s just the way they are brought up			0
this has been my life since i was four			0
ever since i could walk , i had a ball at my feet			0
‘ i ’d argue till the cows come home that it does n’t mean as much to them , whereas it ’s a way of life for us			0
that ’s what i ’ve come back to at @entity4			2
ger : @entity1 train with his new teammates at @entity258 ahead of a pre season friendly ‘ @entity200 is a beautiful place and there are amazing cities to live in or visit for players going to @entity202			1
‘ there ’s a more relaxed lifestyle , so i can understand why people want to do it			0
i ’d just say it ’s a very different attitude to football			0
‘ i was grateful for the opportunity as it was something i ’d always talked about trying			0
i enjoyed some aspects but not others			0
i was fortunate that there were @entity194 guys as coaches , we had good people in charge			0
‘ being so far from home and away from friends and family is always tough , though			0
‘ towards the end , i had an eye on moving home somewhere — and @entity4 was always that no 1 option			1
’ buddies : @entity1 gets to grips with @entity288 as they seek to return to the @entity39 together			1
