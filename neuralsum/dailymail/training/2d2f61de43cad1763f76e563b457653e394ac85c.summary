by @entity0 last updated at 12:40 pm on 28th october 2011 a surgeon has saved a @entity4 veteran 's arm seven hours after it was severed in an industrial accident - using an experimental procedure he 'd only heard about on the medical grapevine			1
@entity9 nearly bled to death on the way to hospital in @entity13 , @entity14 , after his forearm was all but ripped off by a conveyor belt at work			1
in shock and terrible pain , the 49 - year - old at first told doctors to ' just cut it off ' and began discussing options for a prosthetic limb			0
lucky to be alive : @entity9 , who nearly bled to death on his way to hospital in @entity13 , shows off the special hand splint supporting his forearm after it was successfully re-attached during experimental surgery experimental procedure : mr @entity9 's forearm was re-attached in an 18 - hour operation which used an external bypass , taking blood from his leg to keep his limb alive but when he later made a tearful plea for his arm to be saved , specialist hand surgeon dr @entity36 decided to try an experimental technique that had never been written about or taught			1
nor had he even practised it			0
by now , it had been nearly seven hours since the accident , far longer than is normally possible for a re-attachment once its blood supply is cut off			2
dr @entity36 , who is part of the newly created @entity48 hand transplant team , said : ' as i was going to make the decision to amputate , he looked at me with tears in his eyes and said : " i have grandkids and i want to hold them with my own hands			2
do what you can to save my arm "			1
' it was worth giving him a shot			0
he had served our country before — and now we have to help him			0
' almost ripped off : this x-ray reveals the extent of mr @entity9 's injuries			1
his forearm was only attached by a flap of skin when he arrived at hospital @entity70 : dr @entity36 decided to try the rarely - used technique after mr @entity9 made a last - minute plea , telling the surgeon he wanted to be able to hold his grandchldren dr @entity36 quickly improvised by rigging an ' external bypass ' to deliver fresh blood from an artery in dr @entity9 's leg directly into the remnant part of the forearm to keep it alive while he worked to first reconnect the bones , then the blood vessels , tendons and nerves			1
dr @entity36 said : ' i knew if i did n’t do this particular technique , mr @entity9 would surely lose the arm			1
' after 18 hours of surgery , the patient is now using a specialist splint to help with the rehabilitation and has regained some sensation in his arm			1
mr @entity9 , of @entity95 , 120 miles east of @entity13 , said : ' we call them the miracle doctors			1
they did an amazing job			0
i 'm a lucky guy to be alive			0
' i thought that when i went into surgery and came out , i did n't think i would have a hand			2
i was glad to see one when i came out of surgery ! ' once i get this brace off of it and be able to use it , i plan on holding my grandkids again , ' he said			0
success : dr @entity36 assesses mr @entity9 's special outrigger splint			1
he still faces several surgeries to repair the skin , but doctors say his prognosis is good for a full recovery it becomes far more difficult to re-attach an arm once three to four hours have passed since the amputation			1
a finger can survive up to eight hours			2
initially the bone is re-attached , then surgeons generally attempt to reconnect the blood vessels to get blood flowing again			2
after this , the nerves are reconnected			0
the whole procedure takes many hours , often lasting an entire day			2
generally , patients will regain movement in the re-attached limb			0
getting sensation into the nerves proves more problematic as new nerves need to grow from the old end of the cut nerve			0
this can take many months , particularly for older patients			0
mr @entity9 , a veteran of @entity138 and @entity139 , caught his left forearm on a pipe in a conveyor which twisted and mangled it , nearly tearing it off , on august 27			1
with his arm held together only by a flap of skin , mr @entity9 ’s military survival training kicked in			1
he managed to free himself and even directed several onlookers on how to apply a tourniquet			0
he walked to an ambulance that had been called , supporting his own dangling forearm			0
physicians at a hospital in nearby @entity154 determined that mr @entity9 required advanced care and expertise , so he was transferred by helicopter to @entity48 's @entity158 in @entity13			1
dr @entity159 , assistant professor of plastic surgery who arrived to provide secondary support for the operation , said : ' dr @entity36 did something that our entire department had not yet heard about			2
' all i can say is that i was there when dr @entity36 was doing this , and it was amazing			0
the forearm was completely shattered			0
' mr @entity9 was discharged after a 10 - day hospital stay that included grafting skin from his thigh to his forearm			1
wearing a dynamic outrigger splint that resembles scaffolding to support his healing forearm , mr @entity9 now receives occupational therapy and follow - up care at @entity48			2
he still faces several surgeries to repair the skin , but doctors say his prognosis is good for a full recovery .			0

amputated limbs normally ca n't be saved after three to four hours
surgeon resorts to technique he had only heard of , never even read about
*war* veteran @entity9 begged surgeons to save his arm so he could hold his *grandchildren*
