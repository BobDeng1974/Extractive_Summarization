by @entity0 published : 03:00 est , 26 june 2012 updated : 07:45 est , 26 june 2012 families are squandering up to £ 86 a year on electricity bills by leaving gadgets on standby or plugged in but not in use , a study suggests			1
researchers calculated that not switching off computers , televisions and other electronic devices can account for up to 16 per cent of the average electricity bill			1
but while we are happy to let electricity seep from our sets when not catching up with our favourite shows , it appears we also spend an average six hours a day glued to the box – an hour more than previously thought			2
pricey : research also shows we watch tv for more than six hours a day rather than the previous estimate of five the study , by the @entity20 and two government departments , has revealed that @entity23 are wasting far more energy than previously thought , sparking a wave of concern among environmentalists and ministers			1
across the @entity30 , households could be losing £ 1.3 billion by not fully switching off their various electronic devices			0
the study , which closely monitored the electricity use of 250 homes , found that the households were spending between £ 50 and £ 86 on gadgets in a ' non-active ' or standby state , equivalent to 9 per cent to 16 per cent of the average electricity bill			1
the research also found that people were watching more television than previously thought , with the tv on for more than six hours a day rather than the previous estimate of five hours on average			1
this could mean that the @entity30 as a whole is watching 10 billion hours more tv a year than estimated , adding £ 205 million to electricity bills across the country			2
the research , which only followed people who owned the home they lived in , also found single - person households were using as much , or sometimes more , electricity to run appliances for cooking and laundry as average families			2
bigger bills : running a washing machine and tumble dryer costs on average £ 80 a year this could have ' troubling ' implications for efforts to cut electricity use , if the trend towards increasing numbers of lone households continues , the report ’s authors warn			1
almost a third ( 29 per cent ) of homes were one - person households in 2010			0
the study also revealed @entity30 households run an average of five and a half washes a week , and homes with a tumble dryer use it for four - fifths of laundry cycles rather than using outdoor washing lines or indoor drying racks			1
running a washing machine and tumble dryer costs on average £ 80 a year , not including the cost of detergents and fabric softeners			1
and even more energy is used for keeping kitchenware clean , with households that have dishwashers using on average nearly double the amount of electricity on them than on washing machines , the report revealed			1
elsewhere in the home , families were spending an average of £ 35 on powering their computer use , with laptops much cheaper to run than desktop computers			0
' vital insight ' : energy minister @entity105 says @entity30 households need to be more energy efficient and households were spending around £ 68 on electricity for consumer electronics such as tvs , dvd players , hi - fis and radios , but those with the latest ' home cinema ' style set - ups could be paying out more than £ 300 a year to power them			1
@entity116 , chief executive of the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , said : ' it ’s crucial that households across the nation can make informed decisions by having the right advice to help them reduce their energy usage and fuel bills			0
' this research shows that there ’s still more work to be done with consumer advice , product innovation and take - up of energy efficiency labelling			2
' he said the est was working through its @entity134 labelling scheme to help consumers spot the most energy efficient appliances			0
the government said it was working with the @entity139 to make sure green energy labels are displayed on all new electrical appliances to provide clear and easily recognisable advice for consumers			0
the powering the @entity145 report revealed that the households studied were using around 10 per cent more than average @entity30 energy use , even though they were homes where residents said they were careful about their energy habits			2
energy used to heat and power homes accounts for over a quarter of the @entity30 ’s carbon emissions			1
environment minister @entity154 said : ' as this survey shows we are using a lot more energy than previously thought			0
' manufacturers need to develop more energy efficient electrical products and help consumers save money and the environment			0
' we can all do simple things like switching off our televisions , computers and other home electronics and save up to £ 85 on electricity bills each year			0
' energy and climate change minister @entity105 said : ' using energy more wisely in our homes will not only cut carbon but will also help save money on bills			0
' but first we need to really understand how we use this energy in order to become more energy wise			0
' this report provides vital insights into what is happening on the ground , highlighting the need for more energy efficient household electrical appliances and indicating which appliances contribute most to electricity demand at peak times			0

research also shows we watch tv for more than six hours a day rather than the previous estimate of five

households with dishwashers use double the electricity than those with washing machines
