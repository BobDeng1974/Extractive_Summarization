what is white and bulbous , has no leaves or roots , grows under the ground and blooms mysterious and spectacular pink flowers ? it may sound like a riddle , but the answer is quite straight forward ; a bizarre and extremely rare orchid that has only been found at ten locations in @entity11			1
the @entity12 – or @entity12 - is one of three plants in the country that does not require chlorophyll to survive according to @entity17 , a senior threatened species officer at the @entity11 @entity19			1
an @entity12 : the rare plant has no roots or leaves and grows underground ' it differs from most orchids in having no chlorophyll			1
it ca n't produce its own sugars and is entirely reliant on a fungus that infects it to bring water and nutrients to it , ' mr @entity17 told @entity33			0
' the plant grows underground and the flower is presented at the surface of the soil amongst the litter			2
' the orchid is made of only a number of tubers – think tiny potatoes – under the ground , from which a white 15cm - long and 1.5cm - wide stem extends and produces a glistening flower that appears only just above the surface of the ground			2
' the flower they produce is in a dense head , a bit like a @entity53 but only as big as a 20 cent coin			0
the flowers themselves are a creamy white colour and translucent with purple spots within the flower , ' mr @entity17 said			0
the flower produced by the orchid is the size of a 20 cent coin and can only be found emerging at the surface of the soil ' it existence is highly cryptic given that it grows almost completely below the soil surface , and therefore is usually located only when the soil is disturbed			1
' samples of the plant , which is classified as ' vulnerable ' due to the threat of its extinction in the long term , have been sent to @entity76 in the @entity77 for genetic testing where a specialist will determine how it relates to other non-photosynthesising plants			1
' this research is important because the orchid 's habitat requirements are poorly understood and no particular vegetation type has been clearly associated with the species , although it is known to occur in some @entity11 forests and flowers september to november , ' mr @entity17 said			2
' the plants have certainly been driven through their evolutionary history to adopt this method of living as a means of surviving			0
a plant producing no parts above the ground is n't going to be losing a lot of water because water is lost through leaves , so therefore it can be considered a way of saving water - but it 's a pretty drastic way to save water			0
' samples of ' vulnerable ' classified plant have been sent to @entity76 in the @entity77 for genetic testing , where a specialist will determine how it relates to other non-photosynthesising plants there are currently another three other orchid species in @entity109 that do not require chlorophyll to grow , two of which are found in @entity109 while the other two have only been found in the eastern states			1
' they are distinguished either by where they occur or the shape and character of their flowers			0
this is the first one to be sent to the @entity77 , but one other of its species has had its dna sampled as well , ' mr @entity17 said			0
while different underground orchid species have been found in other parts of the world , mr @entity17 explained that ' while they are widespread , there are not a great many of them that have this life form ' .			2

eastern underground orchids have been found at only 10 locations in @entity11
they have no roots or leaves and their flowers can only just be seen at the surface of the soil
a sample of the orchid has been send to a specialist at @entity76 in the @entity77 for genetic testing
@entity109 has a total of four *native* orchids which grow underground as they do not require chlorophyll to grow
