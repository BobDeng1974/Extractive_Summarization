by @entity0 published : 21:13 est , 16 february 2013 updated : 21:13 est , 16 february 2013 @entity1 will be among the judges to benefit from the @entity4 ruling taxpayers will have to pay a massive £ 2 billion to thousands of part - time judges after ministers lost a seven - year court battle to stop them claiming the right to a pension			1
more than 8,000 sitting and thousands more retired part - time judges will be entitled to a public - sector pension for the first time after the decision by @entity4 judges			1
among the beneficiaries will be @entity1 and millionaire @entity18 mp @entity17			0
but none of the lawyers , many of whom have earned millions of pounds in legal aid , will have to contribute to their ‘ free ’ pension – meaning the @entity26 must find extra cash to settle the bill while at the same time cutting pay and pensions across the rest of the public sector			1
mps , public - sector workers and taxpayer groups last night condemned the decision			1
@entity38 mp @entity37 described the pensions payments as paying ‘ silly ’ money to lawyers , adding : ‘ it strikes me that there is a conflict of interest if judges are sitting in judgment about the amount of money in their own pensions			1
’ @entity51 , chief executive of the @entity52 ’ @entity54 pressure group , said : ‘ this judgment will cost taxpayers a huge amount of money at a time when they can least afford it			2
’ @entity60 , assistant general secretary of the probation union @entity63 , added : ‘ everyone else who draws a pension has paid into the relevant pot and the same should apply to part - time judges			1
‘ it ’s clearly not fair if someone can draw a pension when they ’ve not contributed to it			2
’ until now part - time judges , who are paid up to £ 800 a day , were excluded from the government ’s generous pension deals reserved for full - time members of the judiciary			1
a typical final - salary pension for a part - time judge who has served 25 years will be worth about £ 125,000 – or £ 5,000 a year over 25 years			1
but some fee - paid judges who sit almost all year long could be entitled to pensions valued at more than £ 1 million			1
hundreds of part - time judges who have retired have launched legal action against the government to get back - dated pensions			1
the government said it was justified in excluding part - time and fee - paid judges on the basis of fairness and cost , but the @entity4 judges rejected that argument			1
most part - time judges are wealthy barristers and solicitors who have made millions out of the legal aid system , have had successful careers at the @entity101 and already have their own separate private pensions			1
@entity38 mp @entity37 , left , described the pensions payments as ' silly '			0
@entity18 mp @entity17 , right , will be among the beneficiaries the decision to award them additional retirement payouts comes after a seven - year legal battle by a leading @entity110 , @entity111 , who claimed the judicial pension scheme for salaried full - time judges discriminated against those who worked part - time			1
mr @entity111 , 73 , retired as a part - time recorder in 2005			1
the barrister earned hundreds of thousands of pounds during his 27 years of judicial service , but argued that under @entity120 law it was unfair to deny him an additional pension			2
the @entity122 said : ‘ the recent court judgment in the @entity111 case on the employment status of fee - paid judges is complex and its implications need to be considered in full			2
it remains subject to further legal proceedings so the final outcomes and costs remain highly uncertain			0
’ it added : ‘ the department has estimated that in the worst - case scenario the maximum possible exposure to the @entity132 could be up to £ 2 billion			0
there is no immediate cost to the taxpayer , and any future liabilities would be met over a period of several years			0
’ @entity141 , of barristers ’ chambers @entity139 , which represented mr @entity111 , said : ‘ mr @entity111 illustrates the importance for both public and private sector employers of ensuring that pay differentials are not discriminatory			2
‘ the government had argued that for a number of different reasons the differentials in pay between part - time and full - time judges were objectively justified			1
‘ the court decided in the end that all those reasons came down to cost , and that cost can never objectively justify discrimination			0
’ he told @entity160 : ‘ so although in the current financial crisis there is often a limited budget available to employers , and it is up to employers to decide how much of that budget to use to pay employees , employers can not discriminate between employees when fixing pay from that budget			0
’ many people think judges are out of touch			0
this astonishing pension grab proves they are greedy as well			0
for an already highly affluent clique to insist on their legal entitlement to as much as £ 2 billion in extra pension perks – money which does not exist , and will have to be taken from future taxation – is an insult to the public they are supposed to serve			2
@entity184 is already convulsed by the financial consequences of having promised too much in pensions to too many civil servants			0
not only has the cost become unsupportable , especially for an economy that is not growing , but the issue sparks division and resentment			0
there are the public - sector workers on the one hand with enviable , inflation - proofed pensions underwritten by the @entity26 , and then there is everyone else battling to save for retirement when interest rates are the lowest in history			1
judges sit in splendour at the very top of the pensions pile			0
their entitlements are lavish beyond the dreams of the average saver			0
and the cost to the taxpayer is eye - watering			0
currently , judges need to work for just 20 years to retire on the equivalent of half their final salary , which they can collect along with a handsome one - off sum			2
for a high court judge , that could mean retiring on about £ 90,000 plus a £ 200,000 cash payment			0
compare that to an average 65 - year - old man wanting to buy an inflation - linked pension today from an insurance company			2
to obtain similar benefits to those enjoyed by the judge , he would have had to amass £ 2 million in his pension fund			0
if he were self - employed or a private sector worker , he would have had to contribute most of that himself			2
the government is rightly seeking to cut back judges ’ pensions along with those of other public - sector workers			1
but the profession has so far proved highly resistant			0
this case , involving part - timers , suggests judges are hell - bent on taking everything to which they and their legal allies in the courts can argue that they are entitled to			1
the financial crisis has thrown up many cases where bankers and others have tried to prove legal entitlements to vast pensions and payoffs , but where shareholders and the public have furiously disagreed			0
a court may approve these payments to judges – but that does not make them right .			0

more than 8,000 sitting and thousands more retired part - time judges will be entitled to a public - sector pension for the first time after the decision by @entity4 judges
