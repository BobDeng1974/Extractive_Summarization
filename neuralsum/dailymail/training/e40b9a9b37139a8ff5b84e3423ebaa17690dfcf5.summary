strikes by @entity3 staff at @entity5 's borders aimed at paralysing airports during @entity7 are not justifiable or right , @entity0 has said			1
the prime minister today waded into the row after thousands of immigration staff voted to walk out over jobs , pay and other issues			0
members of the @entity15 could go on strike within a week , it was announced last night			1
concerns : fears of travel chaos during the @entity20 have been raised after thousands of staff at the @entity3 - including airport immigration workers - voted to go on strike mr @entity0 , who is in @entity24 , @entity25 , said this morning : ' there was a 20 per cent turn out and a very narrow margin			1
' he added that strike action should not take place , adding : ' i do not think it would be right , i do not think it would be justifiable			2
' @entity34 sources said the strike would be timed to cause ‘ maximum pain ’			2
critics accused union bosses of ‘ deeply unpatriotic ’ behaviour			0
the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) said 57 % of its members had backed a campaign of action in protest at ' cuts '			1
while 16,000 @entity15 members in the @entity3 were balloted , with a 57 % vote for strikes and 75 % majority for other forms of action , the turnout was just 20 %			1
barely 11 per cent of @entity15 union members at the @entity3 voted in favour of the walkout in protest over cuts to jobs and pay freezes			1
that amounts to just 1,800 people out of 16,000 potential voters			0
anger : the @entity15 general secretary @entity62 said ministers have known about issues concerning members of his union but have chosen not to act @entity67 , @entity68 mp for @entity69 and @entity70 , said : ‘ for @entity62 [ @entity15 general secretary ] to threaten to target the @entity20 when just 11 per cent of his own members back a strike is self - indulgent , reckless and deeply unpatriotic			1
‘ there is no credible basis for this vindictive strike action – a militant minority led by a union head - banger should not be allowed to paralyse the @entity79			2
’ most @entity20 athletes , who were given dedicated fast track immigration lanes , are expected to be here by the end of this week			2
but next week ports and airports are braced for the main influx of @entity79 visitors from overseas			2
@entity88 is expecting to handle around 120,000 arrivals each day next week			2
@entity34 bosses will meet tomorrow to set dates for one or more days of strikes during the summer and autumn			0
any strike before the opening ceremony on july 27 would be hugely disruptive			0
a union source said : ‘ we will target those areas which will cause maximum pain for the employer but minimise the impact for our employees taking long periods of strike action			1
they have made the dispute about the @entity20 with the way they have gone about using temporary staff so they can staff all the desks during the @entity79			2
’ a walkout within the coming months could also hit hundreds of thousands of families heading overseas for their summer holiday			0
many schools break up on friday			0
worrying : it is thought any strike just before the opening ceremony of the @entity20 on july 27 could have a big impact on people travelling to the @entity5 to watch the event @entity15 members make up around 5,000 out of 8,000 @entity123 staff who check passports at ports and airports			1
ministers have pledged that every immigration post at @entity88 will be manned during the busy summer period to combat the huge queues and delays seen at the airport this spring			2
but this promise will be extremely difficult to meet if thousands of @entity15 members walk out			1
the strike will also affect staff in the @entity136 , @entity137 and the main @entity3			0
immigration minister @entity138 said : ' i call on the union to call off this irresponsible proposed strike			0
a decision to strike is completely unacceptable and we believe the public will have no sympathy with the union 's decision			0
' only about 1 in 10 @entity15 members voted for strike action			1
the union leadership has no authority to call disruptive strikes on that basis and should think again			0
' the security of the @entity5 border is of the utmost importance and we will use our trained pool of contingency staff to ensure we minimise any disruption caused by planned union action			1
' any action that disrupts the @entity20 will be completely unacceptable and the public will not support it			1
' some 16,000 @entity15 members in the @entity3 were balloted , and turnout was just 20 per cent , meaning some 3,200 voted			1
of those , just 57 per cent voted in favour of strikes , or around 1,830 people			1
three quarters of those who did vote backed other forms of industrial action , such as working to rule and refusing to work overtime			1
mr @entity62 claimed ministers were undermining the @entity3 ’s ability to provide ‘ vital public services ’			0
he said : ‘ ministers have known about these issues for a very long time but have chosen not to act			0
‘ we believe they have acted recklessly and irresponsibly in cutting so many jobs and , in the case of the @entity184 , they have simply tried to paper over the cracks by deploying severely undertrained staff at our borders			0
‘ if these issues are not resolved , they threaten to seriously undermine the @entity3 ’s ability to provide vital public services			0
' @entity191 bus workers have voted to accept an offer of an @entity20 bonus , ending the threat of another strike			1
the @entity197 union said workers will get £ 577 in recognition of the ' massive increase ' in workload over the @entity79			0
thousands of bus workers went on strike last month and were threatening further walkouts			0
in workplace ballots held yesterday 71 per cent voted to accept the offer			0
the bus workers will get a payment of £ 27.50 each time they complete a duty over the 29 days of the 2012 @entity20 and @entity79			2
the average number of duties workers will complete will be 21 , meaning most workers will get a £ 577 award			0
@entity212 , @entity197 's regional secretary for @entity191 , said : ' after almost a year - long campaign , bus workers finally have a fair deal which recognises their contribution to keeping @entity191 moving over the @entity20			1

@entity0 says only 20 % of the @entity15 turned out for vote so strike lacks *credibility*
the @entity15 said 57 per cent of its members had backed a campaign of action
this could include a walkout at border controls at ports and airports including @entity88
any strike before the start of the @entity20 could have a big impact on people travelling to the @entity5
