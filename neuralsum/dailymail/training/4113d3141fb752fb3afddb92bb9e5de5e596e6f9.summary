wasting money : @entity1 says translating is doing more harm than good by holding people back from integrating into society @entity1 has attacked a council for spending nearly £ 700,000 on translation services for immigrants			1
the communities secretary said the money should have been spent on frontline services and keeping the council tax down in @entity13			1

he said : ' the @entity27 guidance i 've issued is crystal clear , councils should stop wasting taxpayers ' money by translating into foreign languages			2
' translation holds people back from integrating into @entity37 society - if they ca n't speak @entity25 , they 're not going to get on in life			0
' this shows how political correctness does more harm than good			0
the money used can be used to protect frontline services and keep council tax down			1
' such translation services have an unintentional , adverse impact on integration by reducing the incentive for some migrant communities to learn @entity25 and are wasteful where many members of these communities already speak or understand @entity25			2
' @entity53 said the costs mostly relate to services it has to legally provide , like child protection and housing , and translating leaflets was not standard practice			0
a council spokesman said the bulk of its costs are linked to providing services that it has to provide by law			0
frontline services : communities secretary @entity1 has attacked @entity70 for spending nearly £ 700,000 on translation services for immigrants at the expense of frontline services ' whilst we have reduced the costs of providing interpretation significantly in recent years under law we are required to ensure that children are safeguarded and where interpretation is needed to do this we have to provide it to ensure we have met our obligations			1
' we restrict translation and interpretation services to essential matters such as signs up and serving legal notices			2
we always review how we can reduce our costs and this is something we have been doing for some time			0
' we do not print leaflets in different languages as standard practice			0

some of 44 languages include @entity17 , @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity20
