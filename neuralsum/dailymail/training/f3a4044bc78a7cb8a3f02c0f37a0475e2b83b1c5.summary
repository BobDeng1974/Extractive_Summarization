@entity1 ' @entity0 returns with the latest installment of his new weekly column for @entity4			0
the former @entity6 boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football			0
the @entity11 boys after @entity14 's @entity13 final win at the weekend they are finally on the edge of competing with and beating the top teams			1
i 'm sure through the summer @entity11 will recruit an experienced , top - class central midfield player and a proven centre forward			1
in central midfield they 've tried @entity22 and signed @entity24 international @entity23 on loan			1
but neither are up to the level of a @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 or @entity31			1
silverware : @entity14 won the 2014 @entity13 after coming from behind to beat @entity32 in a thrilling final uplifting : @entity22 ( centre ) lifts the @entity13 with @entity35 ( second left ) next to him back : @entity22 returned to @entity14 last summer steady : @entity35 scored 22 goals in all competitions they are players who sit in front of the back four and have the influence of a man of steel in the spine of the team			1
up front @entity14 have lacked depth , relying on the inconsistent @entity35			1
@entity11 needs to spend big and spend well and he could turn them into a team which can compete at the very top of the @entity49			1
this season when they lost @entity52 and @entity53 mid-way through the season , it ended their title chances			0
they did not have enough depth to cover for them			0
hero : @entity52 scored the winning goal for @entity14 in extra-time to seal a 3 - 2 win at @entity64 glory : @entity11 lifts the @entity13 in front of thousands of spectators outside the @entity68 both of those players have energy and the ability to turn games , as we saw with @entity52 's winner on saturday to bring @entity11 his first silverware in nine years			1
their weakness through the season has been losing to the best teams			0
@entity14 have beaten all of the others hands down but struggled against @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83			2
i 'm certain , with some top quality players - similar to the level of @entity87 - brought in , they can push on from the @entity13 win and make the last step up to mix it with the big boys			1
@entity90 surely a top target another great result of the weekend was @entity94 's draw against @entity95 to win the @entity97 title			1
@entity94 ’s manager @entity90 has done an unbelievable job pipping the @entity101 giants @entity95 and @entity102 to be champions			1
and they have the chance to complete a sensational double when they face @entity102 in the @entity108 final on saturday			0
@entity94 have shown good team spirit , have tight organisation , clever player recruitment and proven that anything is possible for any team			1
against all odds : @entity94 were crowned @entity101 champions after a draw at @entity95 on the final day mastermind : @entity90 is hoisted in the air by his players after @entity94 won the @entity101 league @entity90 must be a target for all the top clubs now			1
he is humble , he is down - to - earth , and he has clearly instilled in his players the magnificent values of respect on and off the field			0
@entity102 and @entity95 – with all their galacticos , @entity128 and @entity129 – must be scratching their heads wondering what they 've got to do and where they have gone wrong			0
it is similar , i guess , in our @entity49 , to @entity136 , with their wonderful fan base and huge 52,000 - seater stadium , winning the league and going on to reach the @entity108 final.no - one would think that possible right now			2
@entity136 madness @entity136 fans deserve their club to be challenging in cup competitions and not to be told they are not bothered about winning the @entity13 or @entity145			1
privately , of course , it is only the @entity49 that counts to clubs , but to go public with it and take away that hope seems mad to me			0
uninspiring : @entity136 's season petered out into a rather disappointing mid-table finish @entity136 have spent barely any money in recent years and still more than 50,000 supporters fill their stadium at every home game			1
just after christmas i watched @entity160 ’s side play at @entity161 and they were absolutely magnificent			0
they had pace , they were tight defensively , they had excellent technical players			0
in @entity168 playing behind the striker they had a player who could slide passes between the back four and on to the pace of the outstanding @entity173 in front of him			2
soon after that they sold @entity168 , @entity173 was hamstrung with injury and their season was @entity180 were hanging around the fifth and sixth places earlier in the season and in position to challenge for @entity108 qualification			0
disgruntled : @entity136 fans have made their feelings on the current regime known @entity160 was being spoken of as a potential manager of the year and future @entity189 manager.but they have lost their best players and the club is draining any hope of a bright future from the fans			1
back him and do n't sack him @entity195 's choice of players for this @entity197 in @entity198 is brave and , for me , he has made the right decisions			1
leaving out @entity201 and @entity202 , especially after @entity202 's outstanding recent performances for @entity81 , were probably his toughest calls			2
but as fans we will have to be patient and not go into this tournament expecting victories			2
i was in @entity209 at the last @entity197 to watch them in @entity211 in a lifeless 0 - 0 draw with @entity213 and @entity214 when they scraped through the group in a 1 - 0 win against @entity218			1
in the spotlight : @entity195 named his @entity189 squad for the @entity197 last monday staying home : @entity202 was left out of the @entity197 squad and retired from international football our ageing team had no energy , could not compete athletically and as a supporter it was awful to watch			1
everyone was expecting , and of course hoping , that @entity189 would be good enough to get to the semis or the final			0
it was important we started looking to the future			0
these young lads who @entity29 has picked will hopefully be the mainstay of our team for the next @entity197 in @entity238			1
i think then this country could pull off a few shocks and surprises			0
my week ... a dog 's life on tuesday night it was back to @entity161 for a game between an @entity247 and a @entity161 fans xi - who had the full match - day experience against a few legends – and for some reason they asked me along too			2
pre-match meal for me was double pie , double mash and liquor , which i ate in the club car park an hour - and - a - half before kick off			0
just round the corner from the ground , @entity258 has been running for about 40 years and lovely old @entity262 , we call her blue - rinse @entity262 , who has worked their for 25 years , showed the real @entity267 spirit by folding up £ 10 in her hand to give to the @entity270 bucket collectors at @entity271 , who we were raising money that day			0
it 's funny , going back and being in that tunnel just remembering the old days			2
the heart starts to race , the nostrils start to snarl , and the eyes start to squint			0
in the tunnel i was back to my old ways , eyeing up the opposition , just like i used to when i played there			0
the adrenaline rush is quite unbelievable			2
but you soon realise when you cross the white line that you ca n't get about the pitch anymore and you certainly ca n't tackle , intimidate and dominate your opponent like you used to			0
@entity291 was slower than me but had some magic @entity292 was fit as a butcher 's dog and showed class			2
all in all , it was a great night raising money for the @entity270 and it 's a special feeling meeting back up with your former team - mates and remembering old times .			2

@entity11 needs to *strengthen* for @entity14 to compete at the top
@entity22 is not up to the level of @entity28
@entity14 are too *reliant* on the inconsistent @entity35 up front
@entity90 has done an unbelievable job to win @entity97 with @entity94
@entity136 fans deserve their team to be competing for silverware
@entity195 's @entity197 squad is brave but he made the right decisions
