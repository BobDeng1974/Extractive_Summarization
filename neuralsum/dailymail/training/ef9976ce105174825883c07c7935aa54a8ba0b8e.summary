by @entity0 published : 11:40 est , 23 december 2012 updated : 13:17 est , 23 december 2012 dropped : @entity1 has abandoned plans to build his eco-home following the displeasure shown by nearby residents football star @entity1 has shelved plans for his controversial ' @entity8 ' eco-home over fears that it would lead to neighbourly feuds			1
the former @entity13 footballer wanted to build a country home almost entirely underground with locals dubbing it the second @entity17 - make - believe home of the cuddly tv characters			1
but now the @entity22 coach has ditched the plans for the multi-million pound luxury eco-bunker over concerns that he would be ' alienated ' by his neighbours			1
he said : ' there was a lot of local displeasure around the house and it did shock me - how many people were against it and the wind turbine we planned			2
' we certainly were n't looking to become people who were alienating our own community			0
that 's not what we 've ever done			0
' i love where i live			2
i will never move from that area , unless something drastic happens and we certainly would n't want to alienate ourselves			0
so we are considering our options and what to do next			0
' the @entity45 pundit developed plans to build his five - bedroom grass covered house in the heart of rural @entity50 over three years and was granted planning permission in september			1
appearance-wise , there were indeed similarities with the dwelling occupied by the colourful children 's tv characters , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity8			1
almost all of the home above @entity62 in @entity63 would have been built into the hillside with petal shaped rooms radiating from a central kitchen and fuelled by a 130ft wind turbine			1
but the former @entity22 international waved bye , bye to the futuristic 8,000sq ft bunker on green belt land in the @entity72 over concerns of furore from locals			1
however , the 37 - year - old said he still wants his family , wife @entity77 and daughters @entity79 and @entity80 , to live in a home completely fuelled by renewable energy			1
he added : ' i can guarantee that the next house we live in will be all - electric			2
it will be as efficient as possible			0
' futuristic : plans for the home had included a 130ft wind turbine to provide energy but the former @entity95 defender who has previously self - built two homes said the design would be much more traditional			1
he said : ' the windows and cavities will be the best level of insulation i can have and it will perform as a building - but it might look @entity106 from outside			0
' @entity1 's eco-friendly credentials also stretch to his choice of car as he drives a @entity110 , a hybrid electric car			0
he said : ' the vision of a footballer is that he drives a @entity113			0
but in the 20 years i spent driving into the @entity95 car park i can only remember two or three			2
i 'm driving a hybrid electric car that i 've only put three tanks of petrol in since may			0
i 'm proud of that			0
