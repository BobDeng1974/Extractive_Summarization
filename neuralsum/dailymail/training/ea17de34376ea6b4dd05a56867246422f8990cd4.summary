the ten year old had been left heartbroken when her £ 300 music player containing her favourite one direction songs was grabbed by a sneak thief whilst she was at a service station with her father			1

her father @entity54 , 48 , a jewellery agent said : ' @entity4 is definitely the arty one of the family , she is really bright and intelligent and has a real eye for fashion , art is her favourite subject and she really excels at it			0
' she does every single loom band herself , all we do is transport her to craft shows around once a fortnight and we bought her the starter pack and that is it - she is incredible at the designs and people ca n't believe a ten - year - old girl made them			1
the ten - year - old was already into the loom band craze before she started her business ' she is brilliantly talented , her mother and i are so proud of her , she has really made a name for herself at the craft fairs and she is so generous - she has even given her brother and sister a ' job '			1
' he added : ' it started when i decided to take @entity4 out for the day in march for her to see what i do - it was sort of a ' let 's go to work with daddy day ' and she was really excited			1
' she took her @entity2 with her which had lots of pictures on and music by her favourite band @entity88			0
i stopped off at a service station and she put it down on the counter for a second and when she looked again it had been swiped			2

we were planning to buy her a new one when her mum and i had an idea			0
' she had taken up doing loom bands , everyone at school was doing it and we found she was actually really good at it			0
she would beg us every other week for a few pounds to buy new loom bands and we were happy that she had found something to do , it was a nice little hobby			0
' she was already making them for free for all of her friends but her mum thought she could sell them for £ 1.50			1
@entity4 loved the idea , we told her that we would buy her a starter kit which had plenty of bands in and if she raised half of the money for the @entity2 , we would pay the rest			2
despite having raised enough for two new ipods , industrious @entity4 is refusing to halt her lucrative business ' over the @entity135 break in march she and @entity39 wre spending around two to three hours each day making loom bands and when she went back to school she had made £ 100 after two months			1
she then started at craft fairs and would make £ 100 each month , so far she has made around £ 600 and bought herself the @entity2 and a @entity139 plus treated her brother and sister			2
' it is a really good thing to teach children that you have to work for nice things , it keeps them grounded and down to earth			0
@entity4 will do this for a long time , she loves it and she is really happy making them and she has become much more independent			2
' mother @entity150 , 38 , a housewife said : ' i 'm really proud of @entity34			0
