@entity0 showed footage shot by @entity2 during the @entity4 conflict as @entity5 continued their defense of the veteran broadcaster			1
during his monday night show , @entity9 , he played clips of police roaming the streets of @entity14 in 1982 , using tear gas and firing rubber bullets during protests which he claims led to one of his photographers being injured			1
the 65 - year - old also interviewed @entity23 's former @entity22 bureau chief @entity21 , who was responsible for the network 's coverage in the region			1
the former journalist backed up claims the @entity30 capital was a dangerous place for reporters and ' was n't a joke '			1
his support comes as @entity0 continues to vehemently deny claims he embellished stories of what was going on in the @entity39 country at the time			1
the station 's retaliation was prompted by a @entity44 article last week calling into question @entity0 's claims he reported in a ' war zone ' or ' combat zone ' during the brief conflict between @entity50 and @entity30			1
few reporters made it to the front of the war , some 1,000 miles from the @entity30 capital of @entity14			1

describing the events two years ago , @entity0 said he ' dragged off ' the photographer from danger			1
former @entity74 correspondent @entity73 , who also was covering the event , characterized @entity0 's account as ' dishonest ' and ' completely nutty ' during a @entity78 interview on monday			1

back in time : in the archive footage , none of the stories mentions @entity0 , then a young @entity2 reporter , or makes any specific reference to a crew member being hurt controversy : the voice of @entity73 was heard in one of the clips showing police in the streets of @entity14			1

' two news photographers were reported injured by rubber bullets fired by police , ' said the june 16 , 1982 , account by @entity116 writer @entity127			1
the release of the videos , while providing more detail about the situation @entity0 faced 33 years ago , did not resolve the issue of whether his retellings of the experience have been completely factual			2
in addition to his work at @entity5 , @entity0 has become a force in the publishing industry with a series of books on the deaths of historical figures like @entity143 and @entity144			2
@entity0 , on his program monday night , showed portions of the @entity2 video and said it proved the event was no ' walk in the park			1

he said : ' i was surprised at the article because interesting enough you [ @entity0 ] came on my radar			2
i was overseeing the coverage in @entity163 , it was a brutal war and you were there to cover the war			0
' it was an opportunity for young journalists to get their ticket punched			0
and that was the time when satellite news was on and it was the number one news story at the time			1
support : @entity0 also interviewed @entity23 's former @entity22 bureau chief @entity21 , who was responsible for the network 's coverage in the region			1

it was a joke , at first nobody took it seriously			0
we had the only reporter that actually got on the @entity4			0
@entity189 actually got on there through the @entity191			0
' at first it was casual , and then it became more and more serious and as the military were losing badly , the populous began to turn on the military leadership			0
' there were tanks on the streets of @entity14			2
it was a real country at war			0
it was n't a joke			0
it was a real war and they were taking it very seriously			0
he said the city was a good place to be if you were covering the war , but it progressively got more and more intense as it went on			0
' these were veteran correspondents , we saw the situation escalating , they were n't surprised			0
but they were surprised at the over-reaction			0
' to them it was business as usual			0
it did n't happen over one day			0
you call it a riot , it was a very intense situation where people got hurt and there was a very serious confrontation and it was a defining moment when the populous turned on the military			0
' ' he agreed that it was a violent and volatile situation where reporters were in danger			0
the @entity44 piece was printed shortly after @entity232 anchor @entity231 was suspended for misrepresenting his experiences in the @entity234			2
