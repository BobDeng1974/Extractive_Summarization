by @entity0 published : 16:41 est , 12 july 2012 updated : 10:00 est , 13 july 2012 a group of teenage girls staged a protest outside @entity5 's offices on wednesday , asking the fashion magazine to publicly commit to using ' @entity8 - free , diverse images of real girls			1
' holding signs and walking arm - in - arm , @entity12 and @entity13 of the girl - fueled @entity14 , staged a mock runway show in the middle of @entity18 in an effort to give the editors , and the world , an idea of what real girls look like			1
the girls were allowed to meet with @entity5 editors , where they handed over a petition with more than 20,000 signatures , however the teenagers told @entity30 the magazine 's reaction was not what they were expecting			1
runway protest : demanding that @entity5 use real girls and healthy looking models , 14 - year - old protesters held a mock fashion show before delivering deliver 20,000 anti-photoshop signatures they explained : ' we walked in , there was no handshake , no " my name is " , none of that			1
just , " you sit here , you sit there			0
so you wanted this meeting - what do you want to say ? " we said what is in our petition … they proceeded to take out handfuls of magazines with little post-it notes in them , [ marking ] what they perceived to be diverse images			2
' most of them were thin @entity64 - @entity63 models			0
it was a good start - we love seeing women of color in these magazines			0
but two or three an issue - and all of them super stick skinny - is n't what we 're looking for			0
' @entity13 added that the meeting consisted of the editors telling the teenagers that they had n't ' done their homework ' , and that ' @entity5 is a great magazine , being unfairly accused			1
' both @entity13 and @entity12 were inspired by 14 - year - old fellow spark member @entity76 's recent quest and @entity78 protest against @entity5			1
some success : after 14 - year - old fellow spark member @entity76 staged an @entity78 protest against @entity5 , the editor - in - chief publicly responded ( left ) , which inspired the @entity5 protest ( right ) after she delivered a petition with 25,000 signatures to ban @entity8 from the magazine , the editors publicly promised not to alter girls ' faces or bodies			1
however , at the same time , @entity5 did n't outright agree to stop photoshopping its models and celebrity subjects , and also did not commit to publishing any un-retouched photo spreads			0
miss @entity76 's crusade , while not wholly successfully , was still met with public consideration by the magazine 's editor - in - chief , @entity98 , surrounding the points the 14 - year - old brought forward			0
and as @entity30 noted , when miss @entity76 met with editors at @entity5 , there were cupcakes and a tour of the office			2
@entity5 : the girls asked for the magazine to stop altering natural bodies and faces unfortunately , it seems @entity5 has forgotten who its readers are - these young girls			2
@entity30 wrote : ' what @entity13 and @entity12 are asking for goes beyond banning @entity8			1
they want a wider variety of faces , disclosure if a pimple is removed - a magazine they can relate to			0
' as it states in their petition , the girls only want magazines to stop altering natural bodies and faces so that real girls can be ' the new standard of beauty '			1
the petition continues : ' it 's time for an end to the digitally enhanced , unrealistic " beauty " we see in the pages of magazines			2
' the girls also explained their reason for targeting @entity5 , simply because they see the magazine as the leader in its teen - targeted field , with the most power to affect @entity145 ’s senior public relations director , @entity144 , said in a statement : ' @entity5 makes a conscious and continuous effort to promote a positive body image among our readers			0
' we feature healthy models on the pages of our magazine and shoot dozens of non-models and readers every year and do not retouch them to alter their body size			0
@entity5 pledges to continue this practice			0

@entity12 and @entity13 want ' real girls to be the new standard of beauty '
teenagers ' handed over petition to editors with over 20,000 supporting signatures
