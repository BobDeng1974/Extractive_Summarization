saved : @entity0 was set to be reassigned from his route in the @entity3 village of @entity4 a band of villagers who clubbed together to save their postman have won a victory over the @entity10 by forcing the organisation to back down on the decision to change his route			1
@entity0 has delivered the post in the village of @entity4 , @entity3 for 24 years - but last month he was told that the community would be taken over by a senior colleague			1
locals launched a petition and turned the village hall into a campaign headquarters , leading to a @entity22 as the other postman agreed to pull out and allow mr @entity0 to keep his route			1
however , in the wake of the campaign the villagers - many of them pensioners - have been accused of intimidating the senior postman into changing his mind			1
a trade union said the people of @entity4 were ' disgraceful ' for lobbying to keep their postman , even though they pointed out that they had never even met his replacement and had not made contact with him			1
@entity4 has been part of mr @entity0 's daily rounds since the early 1990s , and he is relied upon to ' keep an eye open ' for vulnerable residents , according to villagers			1
as part of the @entity10 modernisation programme , bosses announced that some routes - including mr @entity0 's - would be merged with one another			1
a colleague was offered the new merged route - because he had been working as a postman for three months longer than mr @entity0			1
when residents of @entity4 heard about the proposed change they were quick to mobilise , launching a petition which was signed by half the village within just a few hours			1
they also put up banners saying ' @entity10 - taking the @entity0 ' , and after 10 days the replacement postman decided to allow mr @entity0 to continue on his previous route			1
retired nurse @entity57 , who has lived in the village for 10 years and helped organise the campaign , said she was delighted by the success of the protest			0
' it all started about 10 days ago when our postman notified a few of us that he had been asked to change his round , ' she said			0
campaign : villagers in @entity4 launched a protest petition against their postman being reassigned experienced : mr @entity0 , pictured on his rounds today , has worked in the village for the past 24 years ' we knew that was n't going to be good for any of us - he did n't want to leave and we did n't want to lose him			1
he 's been the postman in the village for 24 years , that 's longer than most of us have lived here			0
' @entity0 is the most reliable person , he knows everybody in the village and he keeps an eye open for people , lets neighbours know if he sees anything out of the ordinary			2
' we got together and decided to have a protest			0
everybody signed the petition , we got 168 signatures			0
we wrote to our local mp and lobbied the @entity10 to make our feelings known			2
' we have no quarrel with the guy who was going to take over , we just really felt it was inappropriate to replace someone who had been with the village for so long			0
' we were delighted when we heard the other guy had pulled out			0
now we just hope that things will quieten down and go back to the status quo			0
' hq : the village hall was home to efforts to bring back mr @entity0 after he was due to be reassigned row : @entity102 bosses accuse the villagers of ' intimidating ' the proposed replacement postman however , the @entity102 blamed ' hostility ' from villagers for the new postman 's decision to pull out of the proposed changes			1
' it 's disgraceful that customers have been allowed to intimidate a postal worker out of his new delivery round , ' he said			0
' the changes applied in @entity10 's @entity117 office were voted through by the staff and there were no complaints from workers about the agreed changes			2
' as @entity10 adapts to life under privatisation and with increasing competition there is huge change taking place in the business			2
@entity102 has negotiated fair and democratic approaches to change which treat staff consistently			0
' sleepy : but @entity4 has become a hotbed of activism over the @entity10 decision but mrs @entity57 said : ' we 've had absolutely no contact with him , we do n't know who he is or what round he does			2
' we would n't want to upset anybody			0
we 're being portrayed as an aggressive bunch but we 're really not , we just got together one morning to save our postman			0
' we would be appalled if we thought he was feeling in any way threatened , we just wanted to keep the man we know			0
' @entity4 has a population of 350 people with a local pub , village shop and post office , as well as a railway station where trains stop on request			2
villagers now say they will hold a celebratory coffee morning to honour mr @entity0 after their victorious campaign .			2
