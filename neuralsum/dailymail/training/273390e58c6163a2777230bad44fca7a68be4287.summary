by @entity0 published : 08:38 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 06:36 est , 29 january 2013 a dozen red roses is the quick way to win many a woman 's heart on @entity5			2
but if you 're really serious about your partner and do n't think 12 flowers is enough to demonstrate your love , then one extreme gifting company might just have the answer			1
luxury website veryfirstto.com is offering one dedicated romantic the opportunity to fill their beloved 's garden with a sweet - smelling blanket of some 1.2 million rose petals , for the coronary - inducing cost of £ 70,000			1
roses are red : your beloved could wake up to a garden blanketed with rose petals this 14 february - if you find a spare £ 70,000 knocking about behind the sofa your sweetheart would wake up on 14 february surrounded by a sea of rosy petals , as the company will scatter the flowery bulk in both front and back gardens , with a surface area of up to 600 sq ft. the daring endeavour will be executed surreptitiously with the help of floral company petals and @entity20 , whose production director @entity36 said : ' this is the most ambitious and romantic project we have ever undertaken			1
she must be a very special woman			0
' @entity40 , brand expert and founder of @entity43 , says : ' we are thrilled to help ensure that an exceptionally lucky woman wakes up to a dream vision			2
' @entity48 is dedicated to enabling individuals to be the first to have newly launching luxury products and experiences , you do n't get much more luxurious than this '			0
@entity54 carpet : what could be more romantic than a garden scattered with 1.2 million rose petals ? a garden scattered with 1.2 million chocolates ? mmm ... the cost of the big petal - drop will be adjusted according to garden size			0
our advice is to think ahead and furnish your loved - one with a rake , should you choose to invest in the experience			0
and perhaps offer to lead the clean - up come 17 february			0
after all , there is precious little less romantic than 1.2 million decomposing rose petals rotting away in one 's garden just as the weather begins to warm up			2
other romantic gift ideas featured on the site are the opportunity to propose to your partner via a 30 - second television commercial to be screened on national tv on @entity5 ( £ 135,000 ) , a @entity83 diamond print tie ( £ 120 ) and exclusive seats on the private @entity86 space shuttle ( approximately £ 67,000 and available to @entity87 only )			1

what woman can resist roses ? unless of course there are 1.2 million of their petals decomposing in your garden come 17 february ...			0
