the number of homes where no - one has a job has fallen by nearly half a million in just two years , new figures showed yesterday			1
there were fewer children living in families where nobody works even than at the height of the boom a decade ago , they said			0
the rapid drop in the ranks of benefit - dependent families comes against a background of rising employment , and of welfare reforms designed to make it less lucrative to choose to live on the state rather than to work			1
@entity22 hailed the new figures that showed the number of homes where no - one has a job has fallen by nearly half a million in just two years work and pensions secretary @entity22 hailed the new figures as success for attempts to make work pay			1
' the number of workless households has fallen by 450,000 since 2010 , which means 290,000 fewer children are living in households where no one has a job , ' he said			0
' by reforming the welfare system to ensure that people are always better off in work than on benefits , and through our employment schemes we are helping people to turn their lives around so they can secure a better future for themselves and their families			2
' the @entity47 's welfare reforms have come under ceaseless fire from @entity49 and the political left , which say changes like the ' bedroom tax ' and the restriction of annual increases in benefits to below inflation have plunged large numbers of people into deep poverty			1
their arguments have been backed by the bishops of the @entity62 , who point to the popularity of food banks as evidence that hundreds of thousands of people are going hungry because of benefit cuts			0
but the figures showing levels of worklessness in the last three months of last year , published by the @entity72 , indicate that large numbers of people are finding reason to take jobs			0
( @entity77 picture ) the queue for the @entity79 at @entity80 , @entity81 there were 3,843,000 homes where no - one worked in the autumn of 2010 , they said , and the numbers rose the following year , to 3,857,000 in the last three months of 2011			0
however over the following 12 months numbers dropped by more than 300,000 and the new total , for the last three months of 2013 , is 3,392,000 , some 465,000 down on the autumn 2011 workless homes count			0
in the last months of 2011 there were 284,000 families where no - one had ever had a job			2
that total was down to 226,000 at the end of last year , a drop of more than a fifth			0
since the autumn of 2010 , the number of children living in families where no - one has a job has dropped from 1,858,000 to 1,568,000 , a fall of 290,000 or more than 15 per cent			2
the improvement in worklessness figures comes as the private sector of the economy continues to demonstrate its ability to create jobs at a rapid rate			2
the latest unemployment rate level is 7.2 per cent , down from eight per cent when the @entity47 came into office in 2010			0
but there is growing evidence that welfare reforms which discourage benefit dependency are having an effect			1
last year the country 's most respected economic think tank , the @entity118 , said the @entity22 reforms , which include tax credit restrictions , a squeeze on annual benefit increases , and the ' bedroom tax ' reduction in housing benefit for those in bigger homes , ' will strengthen peoples ' incentives to work			1
' however mr @entity22 's biggest test , the @entity134 reform which will replace a range of state handouts with a new benefit designed to discourage dependency , has yet to be introduced across the country .			1
