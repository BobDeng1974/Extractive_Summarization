@entity1 's new £ 28million striker @entity0 is set to make his debut for the champions against @entity4 during the @entity6 clash at the @entity7 on saturday			1
the former @entity9 hitman returned from the @entity10 a winner after helping @entity12 win the tournament in @entity15 courtesy of a penalty shoot - out against @entity17 almost two weeks ago			0
no player scored more @entity6 goals than @entity0 during 2014 after he netted 20 times for @entity22 's side and @entity23 has hinted he is ready to throw him straight into the action - but how will the 26 - year - old fit into the @entity1 side ? @entity27 is set to make his @entity1 debut against @entity4 in the @entity6 on saturday @entity23 described new signing @entity0 as the perfect signing for @entity1 @entity0 's inclusion from the start would mean a change in both personnel and system to the @entity1 side that beat @entity36 4 - 1 at the @entity37 in their last @entity6 outing			1
@entity23 set his team up in a 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 formation with @entity41 operating as a loan striker and playmaker @entity43 taking up his preferred position just off the front man			2
@entity47 duo @entity46 and @entity48 added steel and energy in the middle of midfield , while @entity53 and @entity54 provided the width for the visitors			0
should @entity0 come into the side it would almost certainly be to play alongside @entity41 after the @entity59 international returned to form with a brace against @entity62 ' side last week			2
‘ i think he has all the conditions to be an important player because we try always to play with two strikers , ' @entity23 said of @entity0 at a press conference on friday			2
' he is the perfect player for our squad			0
how @entity1 lined up against @entity36 ( left ) and how @entity0 could fit into the side against @entity4 ( right ) @entity0 returned from international duty with @entity12 after helping them win the @entity10 ' he knows the @entity6 , he knows our team so i think it will be easy for him to settle in in a good way			1
' if @entity23 , who is certain to have one eye on tuesday 's @entity79 clash with @entity80 too , is to accommodate @entity0 from the start against @entity4 , the @entity76 manager will increase @entity1 's goal threat but ultimately weaken the defensive solidity of his side by switching to a 4 - 4 - 2			1
in @entity41 and @entity0 , however , @entity23 has at his disposal the most potent attacking duo in the @entity6 and it is hard to see past the pair forming the basis of @entity1 's strike force for the remainder of the campaign			1
there is also the small matter of shoehorning @entity0 's compatriot @entity95 back into the side			0
in a flat midfield four the 31 - year - old will be tasked with performing a deeper role alongside either @entity46 or @entity48			0
the former @entity9 striker scored nine goals for the @entity103 club in the first half of the season @entity95 has been at his most explosive best for @entity1 when he has played a more advanced and , before departing for @entity15 , he had netted six @entity6 goals in his last eight games			1
the midfielder is capable of performing a more defensive role , as he did at @entity80 and during the recent @entity10 , though it would n't be unfair to describe @entity95 's performance in the tournament as underwhelming at best			0
@entity54 , who was superb in the victory against @entity36 , will miss the game against @entity116 's side on saturday and is also a doubt for tuesday 's @entity80 clash with @entity53 and @entity43 likely to play as inverted wide men on saturday			1
to get the best out of @entity121 will have to provide the striker with service from the wide areas meaning the full backs will be tasked with offering a threat down the flanks			0
@entity54 ( left ) has been ruled out of saturday 's @entity6 clash with a knee injury how @entity23 could set up his side against @entity80 in the @entity79 with the @entity80 match on the horizon @entity23 has the option of resting first choice full back pairing of @entity136 and @entity137 against @entity4 and could bring @entity138 and @entity139 into the side to face @entity4			1
for the first leg against @entity143 's side @entity23 is unlikely to retain the 4 - 4 - 2 formation and could revert to the more defensively - minded 4 - 4 - 1 - 1 with @entity0 dropping out of the side			2
@entity23 could recall the pairing of @entity48 and @entity46 in the middle of midfield to combat the possession - based game of the @entity152 side , and the 61 - year - old will be desperate for @entity54 to shake off his knee complaint in time to play			0
should the @entity155 international fail to recover @entity158 ' pace could be used as a weapon to hit @entity80 on the counter-attack , while @entity95 will miss the game through suspension meaning @entity43 should return to the number 10 role .			0

@entity0 was signed from @entity9 for £ 28million in *january*
