the brother of a woman who was brutally beaten , raped and doused in petrol before her apartment was set on fire has revealed how she forgave her attacker during her astonishing recovery			1
after @entity7 , now 32 , was attacked by @entity8 in @entity9 , @entity10 in july 2011 , she suffered a stroke that left her in a coma for five weeks			1
her jaw , wrist and ribs were also shattered			2
her brother @entity16 , who is hoping to raise $ 65,000 for reconstructive jaw surgery for his sister , has spoken of her inspiring positivity in the face of these appalling injuries			1
' @entity7 first spoke about @entity8 before she was even able to speak , ' he told @entity22			1
' she prepared a letter of forgiveness that our father read out in court and she has n't looked back			2
@entity7 's amazing but we all feel that way			1
there is no point wasting any time or anger on him because he 's gone for good			2
' @entity42 , who was caught after his dna was found under @entity7 's fingernails , was sentenced to 48 years in prison after he admitted to the attack and the murder of another woman , @entity50			1
@entity16 , a skateboarder and artist , recounted getting the call about his sister 's attack as he was near the @entity55 , around two hours from where @entity7 had slipped into a coma at a @entity59 hospital			1
' it was terrible , ' he said			2
' my sister @entity61 called me as i was at a rest stop			0
she told me @entity7 had been attacked and and raped and that she was unconscious			1
i drove there right away			0
' when he arrived at the hospital , he found his sister bloodied , bruised and with numerous tubes feeding into her broken body			0
' she was so unstable they could n't even take her off the temporary life support tubes to make her more comfortable , ' he said			0
' we did n't know if she was going to survive			0
' injuries : @entity7 suffered a stroke after the horrific attack that left her in a coma for five weeks			1
her jaw was shattered and she was left with a broken wrist and ribs after @entity7 suffered a stroke , the doctors put her in a medically induced coma to control the blood clot that was in an artery in her neck , just inches from her brain			1
when she awoke after five weeks in the coma , she was unable to speak or walk			1
' she was obviously the same sister i had known , ' he said			0
' you could tell she was obviously all there , but she could n't speak at all			0
' even automatic sounds like laughing were silent - her shoulders jerked but there was no sound			0
she thought it was to do with tubes in her throat but it really was the brain injuries			0
' after a few more weeks in hospital she was moved to a physical therapy unit where she spent three months re-learning how to walk and talk - and despite the grueling battle , she remained upbeat			1
' she was very , very positive , ' her brother remembered			2
' she definitely gets frustrated at times and angry that this has happened to her but mostly she 's just really positive			0
' hurt : @entity7 is pictured walking back to her seat after making a statement at a hearing last year where @entity8 confessed to assaulting her			1
in her statement she said she forgave her attacker changed life : @entity7 , pictured before the attack , had to learn how to speak and walk again with the help of physical therapy			1
her brother said she still has to think before she can form a sentence speaking to @entity120 , her doctor @entity119 added : ' i believe that @entity7 should n't have survived that day			1
she went through so much and she probably should n't have made it but she did , and it was because of her determination and her joy			0
' when @entity7 left and moved in with her stepbrother and his family , she had mastered 10 words			1
she now lives independently and can say just as much as before the accident - with a little more effort			0
' she 's able to speak now but it takes a lot of concentration , ' @entity16 said			2
' she knows what she wants to say but has to think about how to say it			0
' the next step is for @entity7 to undergo a special reconstructive jaw surgery in january			1
it will help her with speech development but costs a staggering $ 65,000			1
her insurance only pays for a procedure that would wire her jaw shut - a move which would reverse her speech therapy by stopping her from practicing words regularly , her brother said			2
help : @entity7 's brother @entity16 , a skateboarder and artist , hopes to raise $ 65,000 so for her jaw surgery @entity16 , who is based in @entity148 , is now trying to raise the money for the operation with his still kickin ' campaign			1
as well as accepting donations online , he also plans to hold fundraising events			0
he has already received more than $ 24,000 from around 400 donations			2
' she 's really excited about this , ' he added			0
' she 's moving on			0
she could have died but i 'm so glad she was alive and that she could defeat this guy			0
she sees it that she won			0
' @entity7 managed to escape the attack , which occurred after @entity42 followed her home from a july 4 celebration , by jumping from a window and hiding until emergency vehicles responded to the fire			1
she ran towards an ambulance and when the paramedics asked whether she knew her attacker , she repeatedly told them ' no , no , no ' before suffering the stroke			2
unknown to her , @entity42 had killed 19 - year - old @entity50 and hidden her body in a freezer just months earlier			2
killed : @entity7 's attacker had murdered @entity50 , pictured , just months before			2
when he was arrested , he was walking a drunk college girl back to her apartment case : @entity7 stands with @entity176 , the @entity59 detective in the @entity50 case who connected the attackers a detective in @entity59 investigating the murder heard of @entity7 's story and realised the attacker had used bleach in both cases			1
authorities matched the dna from under @entity7 's nail to @entity8 , the suspect in @entity50 â€™s murder			1
a week later , he was arrested while walking a drunk college student home			0
he confessed to both the assaults after prosecutors agreed to not to charge him under the death penalty			0
he was charged with murder and attempted murder , and was sentenced to life in prison			1
@entity7 was in a coma when he was arrested but later composed a statement to be read in court			1
' @entity8 , you caused me no harm			2
my spirit , my soul and my mind remain untouched			0
may you find peace in this life , ' it read			0
she added to @entity211 : ' it was my intention to find the strength in my heart to forgive @entity8			2
i felt extreme anger toward him , then i felt sad for him			0
he must be in so much extreme pain to so brutally hurt another human			0
