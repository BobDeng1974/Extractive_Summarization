by @entity0 published : 07:40 est , 22 november 2012 updated : 14:02 est , 22 november 2012 when @entity2 was diagnosed with breast cancer , she was determined to have whatever treatment she needed to get better			1
the mother of two had been shocked to be diagnosed at just 39 and feared she would never see her young children grow up			1
‘ my first thoughts were initially to panic - i was frightened i was going to die , ’ said mrs @entity2 , 40 , who lives in @entity7 with her husband @entity8 , 48			2
‘ once the whirlwind of the diagnosis was over i realised i ’d probably need chemotherapy , ’ mrs @entity2 , a paediatric nurse , told @entity10			2
‘ it sounds silly but one of the aspects of chemotherapy i dreaded the most was losing my hair			1
@entity2 wore a revolutionary cap during chemotherapy to preserve her hair ' to me , losing your hair is an obvious sign that you are having cancer treatment and i also did n’t want to scare the children with my appearance			1
' but her hair was saved after doctors at the @entity28 offered her a special cap to wear during chemotherapy which allows 80 per cent of patients to retain their hair during treatment			1
hair follicles are normally destroyed during chemotherapy because like cancer tumours , they are made up of rapidly growing cells			1
this is why chemotherapy can lead to hair loss			2
the @entity40 , as it is known , lowers the temperature of the scalp , so the blood vessels become smaller and less blood flows through them			1
this means less of the chemotherapy drugs can reach the hair follicle and the hair is not fully exposed to the effect of the drugs			1
the @entity40 lowers the temperature of the scalp , so the blood vessels become smaller and less blood flows through them the treatment , which is also available at the @entity56 in @entity57 , has been shown in clinical trials to help eight out of ten women in @entity60 and @entity61 retain their hair during chemotherapy			1
mrs @entity2 had been diagnosed in june 2011 after noticing a lump near her nipple			2
she had a grade three invasive tumour – a fast growing type of cancer and more common in younger women who have the disease			2
this means less of the chemotherapy drugs can reach the hair follicle and the hair is not fully exposed to the effect of the drugs ‘ after surgery to remove the lump , my oncologist explained that my chances of survival increased from 90 per cent to 99 per cent if i had chemotherapy as well as surgery , ' she said			1
‘ for @entity8 it was a no brainer – we wanted to do everything we could to maximise my chances of survival			0
' for me , chemotherapy was a small price to pay for a higher chance of survival			0
it would be a long haul , though – five months of chemotherapy , followed by another four weeks of radiotherapy			0
‘ i ca n’t deny the cap was uncomfortable to wear ; it looked like a water polo cap and contained a gel pack which gradually got colder and colder the longer it was on my head			0
‘ i would have to have it applied 45 minutes before chemotherapy started and it felt extremely cold as it i was having very cold water applied to my head			0
it would trigger a typical “ ice cream headache ” and made me feel a little sick i had to wear it all through the treatment session and for 20 minutes afterwards – so for about three hours each time			0
’ the cap was so successful that mrs @entity2 hardly lost any of her hair			0
her eyelashes and eyebrows also lasted until the second half of her chemotherapy cycle			0
‘ my hairdresser could n’t believe it and my friends kept saying how well i looked , ’ she said			0
‘ keeping my hair is a small thing i know – but it enabled me stay positive during treatment and feel normal			0
she has since had scans showing no evidence of the disease and underwent reconstructive surgery in september			0
she added : ‘ i do feel the @entity40 really helped me psychologically , as it meant i did n’t look physically unwell and that was comforting for the children , too			2

@entity129 , 40 , was diagnosed with breast cancer last year
needed chemotherapy after surgery but feared she would lose her hair
offered the @entity40 , which cools the scalp and *constricts* the blood vessels so chemotherapy drugs ca *n't* get to hair follicles
trials shows it helps 80 per cent of users retain their hair
