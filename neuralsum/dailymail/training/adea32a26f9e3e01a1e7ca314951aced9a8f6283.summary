by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today launched an extraordinary attack on the aid charity @entity4 , claiming there is ' nothing liberal ' about its advert criticising the government ’s austerity programme			1
the deputy prime minister warned the opposition to reducing the nation 's debts for future generations would damage ' the values @entity4 is supposed to be campaigning for '			1
government anger at erupted at the campaign which accused ministers of creating a ‘ perfect storm ’ , including ‘ benefit cuts ’ and ‘ unemployment ’ , which is forcing people into poverty			1
the @entity4 @entity25 advert has been criticised by @entity27 mps who warned the charity would lose support @entity27 mps called for the charities watchdog to investigate the mock film poster which also attacked zero - hours contracts , childcare costs and ' high prices '			1
but mr @entity2 is the first senior @entity35 to condemn the stunt , sparking a major row with the charity which is usually seen as an ally by the party			1
he accused @entity4 of opposing the difficult decisions needed to bring down the deficit and lift the burden of debt			2
speaking on his weekly radio phone - in , mr @entity2 told @entity53 : ' there is nothing fair , there is nothing progressive , there is nothing liberal , there is nothing in line with @entity4 ’s values to say : " oh , it ’s all too difficult , we ’ll basically get our kids and our grandkids to pay off this generation ’s debts ’ because that ’s what underlines all of this			1
" ' it appears to be an advertisement that is a blanket refusal to deal with a problem that you can not duck			0
' i really can not understand how some people whose values i share of compassion , of seeking to make sure we do help the most vulnerable , are so willing to just airbrush out of the equation that you ’ve got to – because it ’s the fair thing to do – clear the decks for future generations			0
' deputy prime minister @entity2 accused @entity4 of ignoring the difficult decisions which need to be taken to tackle the nation 's debts mr @entity2 said he ' flatly rejects ' the idea that the government had failed to act on many of the issues raised , including childcare			1
' yes , there are some really difficult decisions to be made ; yes , there are people who are feeling huge pressure on their daily , weekly budgets			0
' but i really think just saying " why do we have to do anything ? ca n’t we just wave a magic wand and it will all be sorted ? " ' i do n’t think that helps anyone ; and i do n’t actually think it helps the values @entity4 is supposed to be campaigning for			1
' conservative mp @entity100 , a member of the @entity102 policy advisory board , said @entity4 was ' behaving disgracefully ' @entity4 has insisted it had a ‘ duty ’ to highlight hardship in the @entity105 , but @entity106 branded its attack a ‘ disgrace ’ as official figures showed another record increase in the number of people in work			1
conservative mp @entity100 , a member of the @entity102 policy advisory board , said : ‘ @entity4 are behaving disgracefully by misleading the public about @entity117 policies and their political campaigning may be in breach of their charitable remit			2
‘ they have shown their true colours and are now nothing more than a mouthpiece for left wing propaganda			0
’ conservative mp @entity125 said : ‘ it is sad , when a charity doing such great work abroad to alleviate poverty , becomes embroiled in politically partisan attacks in an attempt to compete with all the other head - in - the - sand left - wing groups and grab a few headlines ” political commentator @entity135 , former chief of staff to work and pensions secretary @entity136 , said : ‘ i wo n’t be giving to @entity4 again			2
i want to help the poorest people of the world , not finance left - wing politics			0
’ @entity140 , a @entity140 mp , accused @entity4 of engaging in an overtly ‘ political ’ that was not borne out by the facts			2
‘ my concern is that charities should walk the walk - helping make a difference to people at the front line - not talk the talk - engage in advertising or political campaigning			0
they should make a difference to people in their daily life , ’ he said			0
‘ i think we can all see the messaging here and what @entity4 is intending to say			2
my bigger concern in many ways is that a lot of it is not accurate ; we have got a government that is reforming zero - hours contracts , we have seen unemployment fall by 400,000 , we have seen inequality - the gap between the rich and the poor - falling , we have seen relative poverty falling , and we have seen food poverty falling according to @entity168 figures			0
’ @entity169 , @entity4 ’s campaigns and policy director , defended the advert , arguing the campaign was not political and that the charity has a duty to draw attention to the hardship ‘ suffered by poor people we work with in the @entity105			1
’ ‘ fighting poverty should not be a party political issue , ’ he added			0
the @entity180 said it was considering a complaint about the campaign to determine whether a full - scale inquiry should be launched .			0
