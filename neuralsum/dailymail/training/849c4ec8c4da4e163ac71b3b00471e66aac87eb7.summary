as many as 30 @entity1 may now have died fighting for terror groups in @entity3 , it was reported last night			1
researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with @entity6 and other groups but think the true figure could be higher			1
hundreds , and possibly thousands , of @entity1 are believed to have fled to @entity3 and @entity10 to join radical @entity12 groups such as @entity6 ( @entity13 ) and the @entity14 affiliated @entity15			1
but despite the deaths and the mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad , there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more @entity1 nationals			1

he said : ‘ the increasing reports of deaths will not dissuade people from going , because they regard it as martyrdom and a victory			2
‘ it is the ultimate prize for these jihadists and those around them celebrate their death			0
’ @entity56 , a research fellow at the @entity57 , told the paper future converts may even be inspired by the killings			0
' if you are going out there to fight and are motivated by the idea of jihad then you are not going to be put off by the deaths - some might even be inspired by them			0
' most recently , a teenager from @entity68 , @entity69 , 19 , is believed to be among four radicalised @entity70 killed in an air strike in the @entity73 country last month			1
a @entity75 spokesman said last night : ‘ we are aware of reports of the deaths of @entity79 in @entity3			1
‘ the @entity1 has advised for some time against all travel to @entity3 , where all @entity1 consular services are suspended			1
‘ as we do not have any representation in @entity3 , it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting @entity79 there are extremely limited			1
’ @entity69 , also known as @entity89 , from @entity68 , was reportedly killed in @entity91 air strikes @entity69 , 19 , ‘ met the wrong people ’ and was quickly radicalised , vowing never to return to @entity1 @entity69 , who called himself @entity89 , had recently completed a resit of his gcses at @entity95 in @entity68			1
but the football - loving teenager ‘ met the wrong people ’ and was quickly radicalised			0
he is said to have recently vowed to a fellow fighter he would never return to @entity1			2
following his death , his 35 - year - old mother , @entity99 , said : ‘ he called me in february			0
he said : “ @entity102 , i ’m in @entity3 ” , and i hung up			2
smoke rises following an airstrike by the @entity91 - led coalition in @entity107 , @entity3 , where intense fighting between @entity13 and @entity110 resistance forces has taken place in the past few weeks the ruins of the neighbourhood @entity114 , southeast of the @entity3 captial @entity115 @entity117 soldiers defend their country 's border as the battle for @entity121 continues hundreds of metres away ' he rang again and i said : “ do n’t ever call me			1
” the first we heard about his death was when my younger son got a @entity129 message from one of the boys he went out there with			0
‘ he sent a photo of @entity69 dead and the message read “ congratulations , your brother has become a martyr ”			2
my son told him to delete the picture but he refused			0
’ @entity69 was a member of @entity15 , an @entity14 affiliate which has fought with , and sometimes against , @entity6			2
the group has also fought against the forces of @entity3 president @entity142 in the country ’s civil war			2
the archbishop of @entity146 , reverend @entity147 , has warned against fuelling more extremism through the use of violence the group were part of a 500 - strong contingent of radicalised @entity1 who are believed to have made their way to the @entity73			1
although political pressure on the groups has escalated in recent months , there remains little consensus on how to prevent further radicalisation			0
the archbishop of @entity146 , reverend @entity147 , has said the use of force to stop the extremists can be justified in some instances but warned it also fuels radicalisation			0
writing for @entity167 , he said : ' used only in the @entity168 ( the eastern @entity169 ) and despite the involvement of five @entity12 countries in the current @entity91 - led coalition , military force is inevitably seen as yet more “ crusader ” violence and increases support for what it seeks to subvert			0
' he went on to criticise the @entity179 , led by @entity180 and @entity181 , for creating new networks of international terror and said violence should only be used when absolutely necessary			0
' it needs to be integrated as a temporary aspect into the global response , playing a part in preventing groups such as @entity13 or @entity189 from changing the facts on the ground so drastically that all help to terrorised populations becomes impossible			0

at least 24 @entity1 radicals believed to have so far died fighting in @entity3
exact number *unknown* because of difficulty getting details from *warzone*
however the deaths could inspire , rather than discourage , jihadists
