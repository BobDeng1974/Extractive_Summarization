it was probably meant to be a taunt to the home fans , relegated under @entity5 in 2005 , rather than a yearning for their former boss			2
but it had extra resonance on a day when @entity0 celebrated his first win as manager			2
same again : @entity0 served under @entity5 and now hopes to emulate his former boss now that he is in charge of @entity2 spurs have not won a @entity28 game at home since the end of october when they beat @entity31 1 - 0			1
@entity5 was the @entity2 boss who invited @entity0 back to the club he served as a player and set him on a coaching pathway that has led to the hot - seat at @entity8			1
and it has not gone unnoticed that his first two games have seen the team perform with the same spirit of adventure that was the hallmark of @entity5 ’s @entity2 , who twice finished in the top four			1
‘ that ’s got to be a compliment has n’t it ? ’ said @entity0 ( right ) , who was confirmed as permanent successor to @entity44 on monday			1
new man in charge : @entity0 will lead @entity2 until the end of the 2014/15 season after succeeding @entity44 ‘ i would n’t mind following his career			1
i would n’t mind being a pound note behind him as well			0
’ his manner , too , is closer to @entity5 than @entity44 : quick with a one - liner and not as anxious to appear deep as @entity44			2
‘ they can be all doom and gloom if they want , ’ replied @entity0 when asked how he thought this sense of fun might be seen by @entity2 fans			2
‘ i ’m going to do it my way			0
i ’m going to be myself			0
‘ i ’m not trying to be @entity5 but it ’s a simple game , is n’t it ? if you ca n’t pass the ball to your own team - mates , then you have a serious problem because you are going to have to keep on defending			0
that ’s what we did in the first half at @entity12			0
but moving forward we just have to try to get the players better			0
’ smiles better : @entity0 got off to a winning start in the @entity28 at @entity12 last weekend and will now hope to defeat @entity6 at home on @entity7 @entity0 impressed chairman @entity81 during his time in charge of @entity2 ’s youth development programme and billed himself as the man to restore the traditions of the club to play dashing football			1
‘ i want the players to enjoy what they ’re doing , ’ said the former @entity4 midfielder , 44			1
‘ there are pressures but it either goes for you or it does n’t			0
what ’s the worst that can happen ? you get the sack			0
