@entity1 forward @entity0 will not face retrospective punishment from the @entity3 after allegedly headbutting @entity4			1
@entity6 ’s sense of injustice over @entity9 ’s red card on saturday had been heightened by their private view that defender @entity4 was a victim of an attack			1
the left back was fielding a shining black eye after the win at @entity15 but , after reviewing video footage , the offence was n't deemed serious enough to warrant a red card had the referee seen it at the time			2
@entity4 was allegedly involved in an incident with @entity0 ( left ) that left him with a black eye the @entity3 reviewed the footage of the game and adjudged that @entity0 did n't have a case to answer @entity9 ( centre ) is given his marching orders during @entity6 's 2 - 1 defeat of @entity1 the @entity6 captain was sent off for a rash challenge on @entity32 ( left ) @entity6 would not comment publicly on the matter but at one stage in the second - half @entity4 was seen remonstrating with a linesman who he clearly felt should have picked up the incident			1
@entity38 had n't included the incident in his post-match report , allowing the @entity3 to review			0
@entity4 was also critical of the decision to send off @entity9 and claimed his tackle was no worse than a trip on him by @entity0 earlier in the game			1
' we have actually had a lot of bad luck , especially with @entity9 ’s red card as i would say there was a handball before that but the referee did n’t stop play , ' said @entity4			2
' earlier in the game , @entity0 did the same to me			0
' but i just focus on winning games and i ’ll keep doing that			0
