by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:00 est , 6 november 2013 updated : 09:59 est , 6 november 2013 @entity4 @entity3 gov. @entity2 won a second term in a deep - blue @entity7 state , a feat that he 'll argue makes him the ideal @entity4 frontrunner for 2016 in a night that gave both sides of @entity1 's political gridiron something to carp about , @entity7 seized whatever momentum was there to take and moderate @entity4 finally saw a candidate that could help the party shake off the @entity19 influence			1
@entity2 won re-election handily in @entity3 , becoming the first @entity4 to win more than 50 per cent of the vote in a statewide election since @entity23 did it in 1988			1
but the incredible shrinking governor definitely is n't a tea party stalwart			2
the closest facsimile of sen. @entity29 running on a major @entity4 ballot tuesday was @entity32 attorney general @entity31			1
he lost the governor 's race there to @entity36 , the former @entity38 fundraiser who hung a ' for rent ' sign on the @entity44 door and pulled in $ 34 million of his own for tuesday 's squeaker			2
@entity31 raised just $ 20 million			0
republicans like @entity2 who have learned how to win in a heavily @entity7 ' blue ' state like @entity3 , can win anywhere – even in states where @entity7 hold an organizing advantage			1
that 's a song @entity54 camp will be singing from tomorrow through the 2016 @entity4 nominating convention			2
if it takes the odd embrace of a @entity7 president to make it happen , as @entity2 did after @entity60 , then so be it			1
and republicans like @entity31 , who bank on their states staying ' red ' forever , will always be disappointed when real - world issues intervene			1
and it 's @entity67 who 's sowing political good will for her among key @entity7 -- like old pal @entity36 -- whose support she 'll need in 2016 not enough : @entity4 @entity31 lost the @entity32 governor 's race because he allowed himself to be pigeonholed as a far - right tea partier , something even the death spiral of @entity76 was n't helpful enough to overcome @entity32 's demographic shifts since 2009 are astounding : white voters were 78 per cent of the state 's voters in 2009 , and are down to 72 per cent just four years later			1
the influx of black and @entity83 voters has given @entity7 a reliable base and a hedge against @entity76 - like disasters			2
combined with a sharply growing federal government workforce in @entity32 's northern counties – another group that votes @entity90 by a generous majority – @entity32 is no longer part of the reliably @entity93			0
neither is @entity95 , judging from the last two presidential elections			0
if the @entity4 takes any so - called ' purple ' state for granted in 2016 , it 's lights out and an inaugural ball for @entity65 president @entity65			1
the ray of sunshine for @entity4 comes from @entity103 , where president @entity105 's approval numbers are under 40 per cent for the first time			1
the wildly unpopular @entity76 , along with scandals in @entity105 's justice , treasury , state and defense departments , have made campaigning with him a risky venture			2
while that wo n't matter much in 2016 , @entity105 's lame - duck year , it spells trouble for @entity7 in 2014			1
past performance may not be indicative of future results : liberal democrat @entity119 won the @entity122 mayor 's race , but it 's unwise to read broader implications into the outcome , just as @entity127 's tenure was n't a sign of @entity129 run amok in the @entity130 @entity32 @entity7 governor - elect @entity36 won by freezing his opponent in tea - party carbonite and not letting him escape the imaginary ghetto of the far right wing			1
democrats can keep doing that , and they 'll keep winning in @entity32 on tuesday , @entity31 managed to close an 11 - point gap to just 2 - 1/2 percentage points , largely by harping on @entity76			1
his own right - wing credentials hurt him – half of @entity32 voters told exit pollsters that he was ' too conservative ' – but playing on @entity105 's negatives was almost enough to cut through that disadvantage			1
too soon ? sen. @entity29 , the @entity147 's biggest standard - bearer , is already scoping out @entity148 and @entity149 in advance of 2016 , but his brand of quasi-libertarian politics may never catch on enough for him to win beyond @entity153 so @entity4 who can shake their images as social - issue @entity147 warriors will have a leg up in races that become referenda on @entity105 and his health insurance overhaul			1
in 2014 , @entity76 will be the only show in town			0
a large majority of voters in exit polls tuesday said the economy remains their top concern , occupying their minds far more than health care , abortion , or any other hot - button issue			2
it really is , still , ' the economy , stupid			0
' in @entity175 , for instance , a proposed $ 950 million income tax hike for education lost by a massive 66 - 34 margin despite backing from gov. @entity177 and @entity122 mayor @entity127 – who put $ 1 million of his own money into the effort			0
republicans can keep winning , at least in local and district - wide races , by casting themselves in the role of superheroes fighting the evils of tax - and - spend liberalism			0
similar messaging helped the @entity4 retain firm control of the @entity190 on tuesday , despite losing the statewide governor 's race			0
as long as the @entity4 remembers that , it will keep control of the @entity195 after the 20134 election			0
but whether the @entity195 ends up vastly more @entity4 or only slightly so , the real game is in the @entity198 where @entity4 hold 45 seats and are aching to reach 51			0
next year , 33 senators will face re-election , including 13 republicans and 20 @entity7			0
most models show the @entity4 picking up at least four of those , with three more rated as toss - ups			0
all 20 of those @entity7 voted to pass the @entity76			0
should both houses of @entity208 fall under @entity4 control , @entity105 's last two years in office will be difficult ones			1
and if the @entity76 system is in mid-crumble by then , the @entity105 legacy - builing effort will be at a standstill			0
bromance : @entity3 gov. @entity2 caught flak from his own party for chumming up with @entity105 after @entity218 , but more than 60 per cent of the @entity7 - majority state either liked him more or forgave him scratching that itch : former president @entity38 has at least one more political season in him , and his popularity is far greater than president @entity105 's at the moment liberals won a key victory tuesday in @entity122 , a progressive enclave that curiously had kept @entity7 out of @entity226 since 1993			1
but hizzoner @entity119 's new post is less of a sign of @entity7 power than a course correction that was inevitable in a city that largely treats republicans as a ghettoized minority			2
in order to win anywhere else , @entity7 will have to take a page from the @entity36 playbook : raise ungodly sums of money , spend heavily on negative ads , isolate your opponent against women and minorities			1
lather , rinse , repeat			0
small coattails : @entity105 's ratings are in the tank , making his brand of help the one thing @entity7 should n't rush out to vie for			1
he told supporters on monday that he has one last campaign to fight -- and it 's over his own flailing health care law , not anyone 's electoral fortunes republicans , meanwhile , need to resolve the inner turmoil between the tea party and the moderate wing of @entity2 - types who seem to be getting along with far less storm and stress			1
now that the @entity76 battles have been fought and the law seems to be withering on its own vine , the larger tea party movement will still have its place			0
but the more it becomes a central focus for the @entity4 , the easier it will be for @entity7 to pick off its candidates , one by one			2
even in @entity278 , a state tailor - made for flag - waving tea partiers , the more conservative candidate lost @entity4 congressional primary on tuesday night			2
the @entity4 primary presented a classic clash between the two sides of the @entity4			0
@entity283 was the establishment , pro-business candidate			0
he ended up six points ahead of tea partier @entity287			0
it 's one thing if the tea party ca n't win in @entity3			1
but in @entity278 ? it seems inevitable that @entity2 will end up staring down sen. @entity29 for the @entity4 presidential nomination in less than three years , with the winner drawing @entity65 for the main event			2
the @entity4 will need to do some soul - searching before then .			0

given his *rapport* with @entity7 and *independents* , it 's tough to argue @entity2 is n't the @entity4 to beat in 2016
the @entity302 are already in favor - storing mode , helping their old fundraising *wunderkind* @entity36 win the @entity32 governorship
the poor showing in @entity32 for the tea - party - backed attorney general @entity31 should worry the @entity4 's far - right wing
republicans ca n't afford to run many more candidates in ' purple ' states who can be easily marginalized as conservative *outliers*
democrats can keep winning with the tested plan of *hoovering* up money and spending it on negative ads that motivate women and minorities
president @entity105 's coattails are *perilously* short , and *threaten* to disappear entirely as his poll numbers *plunge* and his health care scheme *falters*
