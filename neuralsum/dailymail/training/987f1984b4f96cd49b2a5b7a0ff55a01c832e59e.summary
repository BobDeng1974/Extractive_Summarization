in north @entity1 , they perhaps hoped that he would never come back to the @entity3			1
at least , if he did , they hoped he would come back home to them at @entity8			2
it was never likely , of course			0
@entity11 has always craved challenges and those who do so rarely go back , they only look forward			1
that is why @entity11 left @entity15 for @entity16 in the first place			1
they may never forgive him at @entity8			0
at @entity21 , meanwhile , they will merely learn to love him if he continues to play as he did here			1
of course , it is peculiar to see him in @entity21 blue			1
we will get used to it soon enough , though , if he produces more moments like the one that lit up the first half at @entity45			0
pass of the season : fabregas played forward the perfect ball for @entity26 to score and give @entity21 the lead the technical levels of our sport continue to improve , despite what the romantics say			2
still , though , there are some things only certain players can do , even at this exalted level of the game			0
only a tiny percentage of @entity3 players , for example , would even have seen @entity26 ’s run on the periphery of his vision when the ball was played to @entity11 on the edge of the penalty area midway through the half with the game poised at 1 - 1			1
even fewer could have picked the pass , first time with his right foot , that allowed the @entity27 to advance on goal and score			0
it was a ‘ blink and you will miss it ’ moment — the kind of pass you will only see a handful of times each season			0
@entity11 ( right ) was pretty imperious all night and was certainly helped on his @entity21 league debut by a midfield that provided him with willing runners and angles throughout the game			1
when you can see things and pass the ball as well as he can , you need moving targets			0
this is what @entity11 had during his better years at @entity8 and , of course , his time back at @entity15 and with the @entity95 national team in recent years			2
we have all seen him play as a ‘ false nine ’ for club and country in @entity95 but he will be glad to know that is not the role @entity34 has in mind for him at @entity102			2
middle man : the @entity104 plays the ball forward under pressure from @entity24 midfielder @entity107 ‘ i know clearly the player he is , ’ said @entity34			1
‘ in @entity15 he was playing all over			0
nine , fake nine , winger but he knows that i know his best position			0
he gives us what we need in midfield			0
he brings other people in			0
’ it may be too early to say this but there did appear to be signs that @entity21 will play a little more expansively over the next nine months than they did previously under @entity34 in either of his two tenures			1
if they do , @entity11 - anchored at the base of midfield on monday night - will be key			1
here , he pulled strings for the likes of @entity26 and @entity21 ’s new centre forward @entity128 and he was , on the whole , the best player in a pretty impressive @entity21 performance			1
skills : @entity11 backheels the ball into @entity135 's direction who crossed for @entity21 's opener precision : fabregas played in @entity26 for the second with an exquisite through ball over the top of the defence @entity144 : fabregas sent in a perfect corner which was neatly converted by defender @entity135 for the third certainly a midfield featuring players like @entity11 , @entity26 , @entity150 and the @entity152 @entity151 seems set up to move the ball with a little more pace and imagination than some we have seen in the past			1
on monday night it was a style of football that dazzled @entity24 at times			2
home manager @entity160 will not be too disheartened			0
the good news , he will have told his players , is that they only have to face @entity21 one more time this season			2
@entity24 ’s campaign will not stand or fall on the back of nights like these			2
next weekend they go to @entity169 and perhaps we will learn a little more about them there			0
on ‘ @entity174 ’ — as they have branded it — they scored first and briefly a dream loomed large			0
@entity11 was the man with the big pin , though , and when he burst the bubble he did so in a way that many people here will remember			1
everywhere : @entity11 covered huge masses of the pitch during his first game back in the @entity3 off the mark : @entity21 's new striker @entity128 leathers the ball home on his @entity3 debut @entity21 are title contenders - @entity34			1

@entity21 new boy @entity11 put in man of the match performance against @entity24
blues beat newly - promoted @entity24 3 - 1 in @entity3 opener
@entity104 set up all three of @entity34 's sides goals
