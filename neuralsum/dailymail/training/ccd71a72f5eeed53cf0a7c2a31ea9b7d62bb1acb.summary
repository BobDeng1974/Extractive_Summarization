by @entity0 the @entity1 are known throughout the world for their eccentricity and behaviour that leaves many foreigners scratching their heads			1
it was with this in mind that @entity11 created a body of photographs documenting @entity1 customs and identity between 1966 and 1969			1
humorous yet melancholy , these stills were a departure from anything else being produced at the time			0
they quickly attracted the attention of the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) , @entity23 where they were exhibited in 1969			0
@entity25 , in 1972 , @entity11 died from leukaemia aged just 30			1
however , his short but prolific career had a lasting influence on the development of @entity31 photography from the 1970s through to the present day			2
in 1970 , @entity32 , an 18 - year - old photography student at @entity33 , was introduced to @entity11 and was immediately inspired by his work			2
@entity32 moved to @entity35 in 1974 and produced the non-conformists , a series of images shot in black and white in and around the @entity39			0
this project started within two years of @entity11 â€™ death and demonstrates his legacy and influence			2
now the work of the two photographers is the subject of an exhibition at the @entity48 in @entity49 called ' only in @entity1 '			1
eccentrics : @entity11 created a body of photographs documenting @entity1 customs and identity between 1966 and 1969			1
this image taken in @entity56 in 1968 , shows a man using an unusual method to beat the sun young love : an infatuated young couple share a tender moment on a @entity64 boat trip in 1967 cabbage on display : an auction of @entity69 goods in @entity70 in @entity71 , 1978 when worlds collide : a beauty contest in @entity74 , 1967			0
this picture , possibly taken in @entity76 , @entity77 , between 1967 and 1968 shows a free spirit in swimming trunks and some other slightly more formally dressed men quirky : two women take shelter as they enjoy some refreshments during @entity85 in 1967 visionary : sadly , the photographer never saw the impact his photography would have			0
he died at just 30 @entity91 beauty : the black and white stills brim with character and energy			0

@entity11 *toured* the @entity31 between 1966 and 1969 *seeking* out odd @entity31 customs
the @entity99 - born photographer was *fascinated* by the @entity1 and their *capacity* for off - the - wall behaviour
he *tragically* died from leukaemia aged just 30 , but work is now on display at the @entity48 in @entity49
