@entity0 says he would guard against advising a young @entity2 player to sign for @entity3 and admits his move cost him a place at the @entity6			1
the 23 - year - old is starting afresh with @entity8 this week having ended a frustrating two - year stay at the @entity10			2
@entity0 made just seven league starts for @entity3 following a £ 12million transfer from @entity13 and has revealed his mind was long since made up on quitting the club			1
mistake ? @entity0 believes his move to @entity3 scuppered his chances at playing for @entity18 and the midfielder says he would be cautious were an @entity2 prospect to seek his advice on moving to a club such as @entity3			1
' personally , i would probably say do n’t sign now , ' said the £ 10m man			0
' i ’d say get as much football as you can , but you just never know - you could go there , do really well and be winning league titles and everything			0
' i would never say “ do n’t sign ” , i would just say weigh up your options and ask yourself if you want to be playing regularly			0
' out of favour : the 23 - year - old midfielder struggled to nail down a first team place under @entity34 @entity0 was rated as one of the best talents in the world at 16 years of age when he became @entity13 's youngest - ever @entity40 player			1
three @entity18 caps followed but he has n't appeared since the 2 - 2 draw with @entity43 in @entity44 last summer			0
@entity0 is keen to stress that he was fit for 47 of @entity3 's 57 matches last season but simply was not selected by @entity34			1
and that , he argues , robbed him of the chance of a return to @entity43 as part of @entity52 's squad			0
bad experince : @entity0 would advise young @entity2 players not to sign for @entity3 ' if i ’d been playing regularly for the last two years , i believe i probably would have been up there ( as one of best players in the world ) , ' he said			1
' i certainly think i would have been playing at the @entity6			2
it ’s just not worked out over the last two seasons and that ’s why i am here ( at @entity8 ) now			2
' @entity0 had several options over the close - season but , after a meeting with @entity8 boss @entity67 , he was sold on @entity68			2
' the manager just came across really well , he ’s someone who has done it at the top level and he knows what the players need , ' he went on			0
' he ’s obviously got good man - management skills , he said i ’d be playing every week as well and that ’s the main thing for me			0

@entity0 admits he would n't advise a young @entity2 player to sign for @entity3
new @entity8 signing believes his time at @entity3 cost him a @entity6 spot
@entity0 claims @entity34 was *largely* to blame for his time at @entity3
