@entity7 is believed to be the world 's strongest girl and her strength is so remarkable that at 14 she could lift a staggering 48 stone - the equivalent of four grown men			1
despite her slight frame and tiny muscles , the 20 - year - old , who aged 10 managed to flip her 17 - and - a - half stone father @entity18 while wrestling , shows no signs of getting weaker			1
by the tender age of seven she was competing in and winning power - lifting competitions and could even lift up her father - a professional circus strongman			1
a year later she could support the weight of four children sitting on her body and aged nine she could easily lift both of her parents on her back			1
these feats are even more impressive considering @entity7 was only eating noodles and water at the time as that was all the family could afford			2
remarkable : @entity7 is pictured lifting an enormous weight on her shoulders when she was just a child incredible : @entity7 , left , performing with a colleague on her shoulders and she shows of her strength again , right but despite her poor diet , her strength kept increasing and by 10 the @entity56 could easily carry three people on her shoulders			1

her father @entity18 , who says that by the age of 12 his daughter was stronger then him , thinks his side of the family have a rare strength gene that few others have			1
@entity7 's great - grandfather managed the astonishing feat of carrying 2,600lbs ( 1,200kg ) on his back in 1910 and her mother @entity70 is also stronger than most women			1
encouragement : @entity7 's father @entity18 supervises his daughter as she lifts a weight as a child			1
he believes she was stronger than him by 12 - years - old despite being brought up on a meager diet of noodles and water despite her astonishing strength , @entity7 's muscles are barely visible and she has thread - like tendons			1
at 5ft tall , she weighs just over eight stone			0
she sets her many strength records with relative ease as her father only lets her show about 75 per cent of her maximum strength for health and safety reasons			0
as a child she showcased her strength in the circus , alongside her performing parents , and later at acrobatic shows			0
and , it 's not just her physical strength that 's impressive			0
she is also a top student and learned to read aged just three			0
talent : a picture of @entity7 lifting another incredible weight			2
she is also a top student and learned to read by three record breaker : @entity7 easily lifts her own weight as she does a pull - up and shows off her skills again , right but despite her talents , @entity7 , who is trained in acrobatics , boxing , kick boxing , wrestling and circus juggling skills , wishes she was bigger			2

i wish i could be big , really big : 190 cm tall and weigh more than 100 kg , like my dad			0
' @entity7 's diet has also improved over the years			2
she now eats one egg and a glass of juice and bread for breakfast , bread and a cup of tea for lunch and for dinner she often tucks into macoroni noodles and occasionally some meat , if her family can afford it			0
she also drinks one glass of milk a day for calcium .			0
