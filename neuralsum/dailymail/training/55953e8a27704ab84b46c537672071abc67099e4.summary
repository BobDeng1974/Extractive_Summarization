president @entity0 stepped into an oil - slicked @entity2 mess on his way out of town friday , contradicting the findings of his own @entity7			1
the pipeline , a 1,179 - mile long planned conduit stretching from @entity10 , @entity11 to the @entity12 , has generated environmental controversy that the administration pledged to weigh against the project 's economic impact			1
@entity0 claimed friday during a press conference before he left for an extended vacation that @entity19 would hardly notice the $ 8 billion enterprise 's impact on their pocketbooks			1
' at issue in @entity2 is not @entity26 oil			0
it is @entity11 oil that is drawn out of tar sands in @entity11 , ' he told a packed press briefing room			1
@entity0 made no mention of oil from @entity33 and @entity34 that will be incorporated into the three - foot - wide pipeline 's load if the project gets a green - light from @entity39 in the new year			1
the three - foot - wide pipeline , pieces of which are seen here , will wend its way through 1,179 miles of @entity19 on a path from @entity52 , @entity11 , to the @entity53 of @entity54 @entity34 senator @entity55 ( left ) disputes @entity0 's contentions about the pipeline , and has helped recruit key @entity58 including @entity60 sen. @entity59 to is side with arguments about energy independence ' it would save @entity11 oil companies and the @entity11 oil industry an enormous amount of money if they could simply pipe it all the way through the @entity26 down to the @entity12 , ' he said , casting the enterprise as a sop to businesses north of the border			1
incoming senate majority leader @entity75 said this week that a @entity2 approval bill will be his chamber 's first agenda item in january			1
but the president hedged his bets on what he would do if a united , @entity82 - led @entity39 dropped that legislation on his desk			2
' i 'll see what they do , ' he said			0
' we 'll take that up in the @entity90			0
' a reporter asked @entity0 if he had been short - selling the economic benefits of the pipeline , and he shot back that ' i do n’t think i ’ve minimized the benefits , i think i ’ve described the benefits			2
' and those , he said , were slim			0
' there is very little impact , nominal impact , on @entity26 gas prices – what the average @entity26 consumer cares about – by having this pipeline come through , ' he claimed			2
' there ’s a global oil market			0
it 's very good for @entity11 oil companies and it 's good for the @entity11 oil industry , but it ’s not going to be a huge benefit to @entity26 consumers			1
' ' it ’s not even going to be a nominal benefit to @entity26 consumers , ' @entity0 said , putting an exclamation point on his argument			0
@entity82 @entity34 sen. @entity55 fired back , telling @entity116 that the president 's judgment was ' just not accurate			1
' ' the president said that the pipeline would move only @entity11 oil and that it would all be exported			1
he ’s wrong on both counts , ' said @entity55			0
' the @entity2 will also carry light sweet crude from @entity34 and @entity33 , and the president 's own @entity124 produced a report that said the oil would be used in the @entity26			1
' that report , a june 2011 memorandum , came from the desk of @entity131 , the department 's deputy assistant secretary for policy analysis			0
@entity134 : rancher @entity135 stands in front of the @entity2 pumping station that will move oil from the state into the main pipeline – something @entity0 said friday wo n't happen @entity55 also had an answer for @entity0 's insistence on friday that the project 's chief negative remains the threat of an outsize environmental footprint that could drive new levels of climate change			1
' i want to make sure that if , in fact , this project goes forward , that it 's not adding to the problem , ' @entity0 said			2
' if we 've got more flooding , more wildfires , more drought , there are direct economic impacts on that			0
' but @entity55 said @entity0 forgot to count the environmental impact of the @entity52 tar sands oil 's current mode of transportation			1
@entity166 , the company that has been angling to build the pipeline since 2008 , is shipping the oil ' through rail or trucks , ' the president said during his press conference			1
the @entity34 senator suggested that he should read the latest environmental impact report from his own @entity174			1
that report , he said , concluded that ' it would take 1,400 tanker rail cars every day to ship the same amount of oil as the pipeline			0
' ' ironically , not building the pipeline will result in more emissions from trucks , trains and oil tankers than would ever be produced by the @entity2			2
' not quite : sen. @entity186 , a @entity188 @entity187 , was one vote shy of passing a @entity2 pipeline approval bill in november , and her failure helped a @entity82 snatch her seat away in an election runoff it 's unclear whether @entity0 is laying the groundwork for a veto			1
but ultimately the @entity197 could have as much to say about the outcome as the @entity199			0
governor @entity200 has approved the pipeline 's route through his state , but a group of landowners challenged that decision			2
if they prevail , @entity166 will have to start over with @entity209 's @entity208 and find a new path through the @entity209			2
that could take as long as a year			0
@entity188 @entity58 sen. @entity186 tried to make approving @entity2 the cornerstone of her failed bid to keep her seat in november and december			0
she was among the president 's allies who have deserted him on the issue			0
oil refineries dot @entity186 's state like chicken pox and provide @entity223 with a recession - proof economic baseline			2
she tried in mid-november to marshal the 60 votes in the @entity226 required to break a logjam and approve the pipeline , but she fell short by just one			0
the @entity229 passed its version of the bill by a wide margin .			0

senator @entity55 , a @entity34 @entity82 , says his state and @entity33 are both planning to move crude oil on the $ 8 billion pipeline
@entity0 said his chief concern with the @entity166 company 's project is the environmental impact
@entity55 said the @entity11 oil 's current transport – trucks and trains – have a *bigger* climate change impact than the pipeline
the president spoke at a year - end press conference before *jetting* to @entity254 for an extended vacation
incoming senate majority leader @entity75 said this week that approving the 1,179 - mile pipeline will be the @entity226 's first job in january
but the @entity197 could decide next month to *reject* its proposed path through the state , setting the project back months or longer
