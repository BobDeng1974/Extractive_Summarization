there have been a lot of ups and downs in the 50 - year history of the programme , but few tv shows have held the same appeal as @entity8 over the years			2
after @entity10 left , i was lucky enough to get my chance and the thing that put me on the map was the @entity15 third round replay between @entity16 and @entity17			1
that match , with @entity20 ’s terrific goal , convinced people i could do the big games			2
special goal : @entity25 scores for @entity26 against @entity27 in 1996 video @entity25 's wondergoal vs @entity27 those were the halcyon days when 10 million people tuned in each week , but things have changed since then			1
we never used to see a replay — the only machine that the @entity36 had that was capable of doing them was used for horse racing ! so @entity40 and i would track the action with words and then a replay would be added after @entity45			2
the other big change has been the logistics			0
we went from preparing for teams of 11 players with one sub to full squads of 18			0
i remember walking around grounds to commentary positions on camera platforms and it was all shoulder to shoulder , but the whole scene is now geared towards public entertainment and glamour			0
legend : tv commentator @entity60 covered top matches for over 30 years for the @entity36 special one : @entity60 enjoyed watching @entity63 at @entity26 after around 1,500 games of commentary , it ’s hard to pick out favourite ones — but there were always special players to cover			1
in the @entity71 it was @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity63 , and before that people like @entity75			0
the one game that does stick out was @entity78 ’s 5 - 1 win in @entity79 and if you pushed me for a goal it would be @entity25 ’s from the halfway line against @entity27			1
i was shocked by the sheer audacity of it and i got a very good view !			0
