command : admiral @entity1 , commander of the @entity3 @entity2 , addresses the @entity4 in @entity5 the commander of the @entity8 raids which killed @entity9 and rescued hostage @entity10 has been berated by a retired lt general for publicising such operations - and putting future deployments at risk			1
admiral @entity1 , who led the @entity9 raid and heads the @entity3 @entity2 , was told by retired @entity18 lieutenant general @entity17 to ' get the hell out of the media ' to safeguard the secrets and security of special operations			1
according to @entity24 , @entity17 told @entity25 : ' since the time when your wonderful team went and drug @entity9 out and got rid of him , and more recently when you went down and rescued the group in @entity32 , or wherever the hell they were , they ’ve been splashing all of this all over the media			1
' i flat do n’t understand that			1
' and he added : ' back when my special operators extracted @entity41 [ @entity42 ] from the hole , we did n’t say one damn word about it			1
' we turned him over to the local commander and told him to claim that his forces dug him out of the hole , and he did so			1
and we just faded away and kept our mouth shut			1
' now i ’m going to tell you : one of these days , if you keep publishing how you do this , the other guy ’s going to be there ready for you , and you ’re going to fly in and he ’s going to shoot down every damn helicopter and kill every one of your seals			2
' now , watch it happen			2
get the hell out of the media			2
he joked that he became a @entity8 because his sister was dating a special forces member and because he was infatuated with @entity79 ’s movie , ' the @entity80 '			2
rescued : hostage @entity10 who was rescued by @entity3 special forces in @entity32 last month ' the fact of the matter is , there have always been portrayals of @entity88 [ @entity88 ] out in the mainstream media , ' he added			1
' we are in an environment today where we ca n’t get away from it			2
it is not something that we actively pursue , as i think a number of the journalists here in the audience will confirm			2
' but the fact of the matter is , with the social media being what it is today , with the press and the 24 - hour news cycle , it ’s very difficult to get away from it			0
' but not only does the media focus on our successes , we have had a few failures			0
and i think having those failures exposed in the media also kind of helps focus our attention , helps us do a better job			0
' so sometimes the criticism , the critique , the spotlight on us actually makes us better , ' @entity1 said , before adding that @entity17 had made a ' great point ' and they did n't want to get to the point where ' sensitive tactics , techniques and procedures are open for everybody to take a look at so that next time we come in on a target we are exposed '			0
the raids on @entity9 and the compound where two western hostages were held in @entity32 attracted worldwide publicity			1
a film about @entity132 - is due out shortly , while @entity134 - winning film director @entity133 is set to release a movie about the operation which ended with the killing of the @entity139 leader later this year			0
hiding : @entity9 watching television at his remote compound in @entity142 before he was killed at the hide - out the interior bedroom in the mansion where @entity9 was killed after @entity3 forces stormed his compound the admiral added he was working to give his 66,000 - person force — expected to grow to 70,000 over the next few years — more predictable schedules to reduce strain on families			1
he also spoke of working to break down the stigma of combat stress			0
' if you have been engaged in this war for any length of time , you are fundamentally changed , ' he said			0
but special operations troops typically do n't seek help for emotional problems			0
' i encourage them to come in			0
we 're not going to pull their security clearances , ' @entity1 said			0
' we 're going to take care of them			0
