as @entity2 and @entity3 prepare to battle it out in the @entity5 , who should you be cheering ? @entity6 is behind @entity7 and the @entity8 , while @entity9 is backing @entity10 and his team			1
who will you be supporting ? there ’s one easy reason to support @entity2 : @entity7			1
the @entity16 manager , @entity15 , had a plan to subdue him in the semi-final but in every other match so far @entity7 has been playing on a level far above the other 21 players on the pitch			1
perhaps the clip of the @entity24 is @entity26 goalkeeper @entity25 jokingly complaining to referee @entity27 that he is giving @entity7 too many free - kicks			1
2 they have a @entity51 in @entity52 and there ’s an @entity54 in @entity55 to promote better relations , apparently by holding @entity57 ( asados )			2
still not working though , is it ? 3 they are not @entity3 and do n’t send their wives down before breakfast to put towels on all the best sunloungers			1
‘ i know he makes your job hard , ’ says @entity27			2
@entity25 just rolls his eyes , shakes his head and breaks into a broad smile			0
‘ he ’s so good ! ’ he says			0
when even the opposition goalkeeper can take pleasure in your brilliance , you have achieved something truly universal — something that can be appreciated beyond the allegiances of club and country			0
but there ’s another reason why @entity83 supporters should consider supporting @entity2			1
if you have any love of @entity86 fan culture and the ability our fans have to support teams through thick and thin , following home and away whatever the difficulty , then you will appreciate @entity94 football fans			1
they have been by far the largest travelling contingent here , for obvious geographical reasons			0
they have also been by far the most passionate and vocal , with a range of chants and songs — mostly aimed at @entity102 , but with admittedly one or two directed at @entity83 — that few countries , other than the home nations , would match			1
fervent fans : @entity2 's support at the @entity24 has been phenominal blonde ambition : @entity2 fans pose before their semi-final ... and they will be hoping for a similar outcome in the @entity5 video we 're underdogs - @entity30 i once saw @entity114 play at their home ground , the @entity116 , against their hated rivals @entity117			1
it was a calamity of a game for @entity114 , who lost 3 - 0 at home in what was their most important game of the season			0
the @entity117 supporters , all 10,000 of them , were revelling in the victory with 20 minutes to go			0
having seen @entity129 and @entity130 fans in similar circumstances , i had in mind a certain reaction , expecting the @entity114 supporters either to walk out or start hurling abuse or missiles at their team			0
instead , for a full 20 minutes , all 40,000 of them — from those in the posh seats to the terraces — stood and continuously chanted about how much they loved @entity114 and how they would never stop supporting them			0
spine tingling : the @entity116 has a partisan atmosphere all of its own talk about the passion : @entity147 celebrates a @entity114 goal against @entity117 in 2006 it brings to mind @entity83 fans applauding the team at the end of this @entity24			1
only in @entity154 and @entity2 do football fans behave like this			1
despite our differences , we have much more in common than we think			0
good teams start tournaments well and get even better			0
@entity3 have managed both those things — as they often do — and that is why i think they will win this @entity24 and why i would like them to			1
@entity3 ’s record in the opening games of @entity167 is remarkable			1
they have won their first match in the last seven tournaments			0
compare that to the way @entity83 often seem to stumble into major championships and it begins to look even more impressive			1
@entity175 teams know how to approach these tournaments , physically and mentally			1
their big players come off long , taxing seasons with their clubs but manage to bring their true selves to the @entity24			1
strong start : @entity182 hits the fourth as @entity184 were put to the sword powerhouse : @entity175 chancellor @entity187 was in jubilant mood in @entity189 1 if it was n’t for them there would be no dads ’ @entity194 or ’ allo ’ allo			1
2 they invented some great kids ’ stuff , including @entity198 and @entity199			0
also , @entity175 wrote @entity200 ’ @entity201 — which are a great way to give your children nightmares after scoffing all those e numbers			2
3 they are not @entity2 and do n’t want the @entity206 ( as far as we know )			2
meanwhile , their bit - part players — the likes of @entity211 , @entity212 and @entity213 — do not become disenfranchised by the lack of a starting guarantee			0
they travel motivated , energetic and ready to contribute when called upon			0
in the most part , that ’s what they do			0
has there ever been a more absolute @entity24 footballer ? arguably , he has never been an a-list @entity223 striker			2
he has never been chased particularly hard by clubs in the @entity225 , for example			0
he is 36 now and playing for @entity227			0
but he scored a vital equaliser against @entity229 with his first touch of this @entity24 as a substitute and is now expected to start in the final			2
a man for all seasons : @entity211 hits @entity3 level against @entity229 to rescue a point smells like team spirit : @entity213 regularly tweets images of a delighted @entity3 squad behind closed doors things like that say much for talent and the knack of a goal - scorer but also for the understanding of tournament football that seems to come naturally to @entity175 players			1
this is not a brilliant @entity175 football team			2
only two or three — @entity252 , @entity253 and perhaps @entity254 — would get into famous @entity175 teams of yore			2
nevertheless , they are talented enough in key areas and function brilliantly as a unit			0
they are managed shrewdly and without fuss by @entity10 and are mentally resolute enough to cope with anything , as they showed in their semi-final against a @entity102 team hyped to their eyeballs on false notions of destiny			2
the last line of defence : @entity253 has shown he is arguably the best keeper in the world history beckons ? @entity254 will hope to follow @entity273 , @entity274 and @entity275 as @entity175 captains to lift the @entity24 one last thing that draws me to this @entity175 team is that , one day , this could be @entity83			1
@entity10 does n’t have a @entity7 or @entity281 to call on			1
his team has n’t been dragged along by @entity284 - given genius			0
it ’s a football team full of good players who know what they ’re doing			0
is there really any reason why — some day soon — @entity83 can not mimic that ?			2

two of @entity83 's biggest rivals meet in the @entity5 as @entity2 face narrow *favourites* @entity3
@entity2 are chasing their third @entity24 win ; @entity3 their fourth
should you support @entity7 , @entity301 et al ... after all there are many *similarities* between @entity86 and @entity94 footballing culture
or should you go for the @entity175 , who are a force to be reckoned with under the tutelage of @entity10
