as a professional bodybuilder and personal trainer , @entity1 ’s toned physique is her living			1
but on a routine visit to an @entity7 clinic she was stunned to be told she needed to lose weight			2
after being asked to step on to the scales , she was informed she was borderline obese based on her body mass index			1
@entity1 , from @entity11 , @entity12 was told told she was ' eating too much ' and needed to go on a drastic diet a nurse then told her she needed to begin a 1,000 calorie - a - day diet , which is half the recommended amount for a woman			1
miss @entity1 , 39 , yesterday said : ‘ the information the nurse has given me is actually dangerous			1
‘ a thousand calories a day is only for people who are severely obese who are not active			2
they should only be on that for a maximum of 12 weeks – generally as a precursor to surgery			0
’ health officials have been accused of slavishly following @entity27 scales – calculated by dividing weight by height – without taking into account individual circumstances			0
the measurement was developed in the first half of the 19th century and critics say it provides inaccurate results for some people , including rugby players with lots of muscle and tall people			0
miss @entity1 , who finished sixth in the 2012 miss @entity43 bodybuilding competition , visited a family planning clinic at @entity46 near her home in east @entity12 on march 5			1
the advice came as miss @entity1 visited the walk in family planning clinic near her home earlier this month at 4ft 11in and weighing 10st 3lb , she was found to have a @entity27 of 29			1
a ‘ healthy ’ @entity27 is between 18.5 and 25 , a score of 25 - 29 is classed as ‘ overweight ’ and anything above 30 is ‘ obese ’			2
miss @entity1 said she was speaking about her ordeal to prevent other women receiving dangerous ‘ misinformation ’			1
‘ the nurse said , “ you are obviously eating too much ” … without asking about my lifestyle , eating habits , taking into account body composition and so on			1
‘ it left me feeling belittled , insulted and confused			0
’ during the appointment to review her contraception , miss @entity1 was told to exercise more and cut alcohol and fruit juice			1
she added : ‘ for nine months of the year i do n’t even drink as i am a competitive athlete			0
i was made to feel as though i was overweight , over-eating and i felt a knock in my confidence			0
’ the health centre and an @entity74 spokesman both declined to comment yesterday			0
according to the @entity7 , body mass index is a measure of whether you are a healthy weight for your height			1
it is calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing it by your height in metres squared			0
a @entity27 calculation producing a body fat percentage of 18.5 to 24.9 is normal , but anything from 25 to 29.9 is classed as overweight , which can put people at a higher risk of diabetes and high blood pressure			2
a figure of 30 to 39.9 is classed as obese , which also carries the risks of certain types of cancer and stroke			0
anything above 40 is morbidly obese and weight loss surgery may be offered			0
a @entity27 calculation of below 18.5 is considered underweight			0
this can also cause risks such as a low immune system , osteoporosis and fertility problems as periods can become interrupted			0
the skin caliper test , which also measures body fat percentage is often considered a better way of assessing a persons weight			2
the caliper is used to measure the thickness of the skin and the underlying layer of fat and does not take into account muscle , which weighs more than fat .			1

@entity1 from @entity12 told she was obese and to start drastic diet
but nurse did not take into account muscle weighs more than fat
the 39 - year - old weighs around *9st* 10 when competing
the personal trainer placed sixth in miss @entity43 in 2012
already follows strict diet and consumes just 1,800 calories
now *warning* athletes about misleading *nature* of body mass index
