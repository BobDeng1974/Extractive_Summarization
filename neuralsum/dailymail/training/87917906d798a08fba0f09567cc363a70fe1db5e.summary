' when we opened the door , it was terrible			0
it was impossible to get out			0
' we saw people on the cliff and we kept the door open because the water was still rising and if we closed it - we would n’t have been able to open it again			1
wrecked : the stairway up to his static home is left pulled from its base as the flood waters eventually subsided into pools of grime @entity20 , @entity21 , near @entity22 ' we saw there were rescue people in a boat probably about 700 metres away from us			0
' we were jumping up and down quite a bit and one guy looked over and saw us			0
he told us to stay there			0
' an @entity47 helicopter was alerted to the stranded girls and they were winched to safety			0

drying out : the @entity20 , in @entity21 , @entity100 , after floods tore through the area this weekend submerged : static homes at the @entity20 in @entity22 suffer torrents of water following heavy rain overnight ' he stepped forward and fell straight into the water			2
