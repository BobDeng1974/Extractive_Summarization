the incredible sounds are the work of @entity9 , a @entity10 orchestra from the town of @entity12 , who have taken the concept of being ‘ cool ’ literally			1
that ’s because their instruments - including guitars , violins , cellos and even xylophones - are all hand - carved out of ice sheets			1
mr @entity33 said he creates the ‘ @entity38 ’ by hand before adding strings , fret boards and other parts to his designs			1
the songs are performed inside an igloo - like concert hall , which is also covered in ice , and seats around 170 people			1
instruments - including guitars , violins ( left ) and cellos ( right ) - are all hand - carved out of ice sheets different bands show up to use the icy instruments which were all crafted by ice connoisseur @entity31 all the instruments stay in tune , as long as the temperature stays cold enough this is n't the first time someone has tried to make instruments out of ice @entity59 from @entity60 in @entity61 became known as the @entity62 after he started making music with instruments carved out of blocks of ice drawn from a nearby lake			2
his amazing frozen creations include harps , trumpets , horns , guitars , marimbas and even a iceridoo - a frozen version of the @entity76 didgeridoo			2
mr @entity59 claims every instrument he makes has a unique sound and while one ice horn he created was used for 50 performances many only last for a single session			2
both the instruments and the concert hall are lit up in colours representing the northern lights			2
the video , showing the local band @entity87 covering @entity90 ’s ‘ @entity89 ’ , reveals the impressive sound that a few slabs of frozen water and some strings can make			0
what 's amazing is that all the instruments stay in tune , as long as the temperature stays at -10 ° @entity99 according to mr @entity33 , the instruments have to be re-tuned after every performance as the breath of the musicians partly melts them			1
for this reason , the violins are suspended from the ceiling so that the musicians body temperature does n't melt them			0
53 - year - old mr @entity33 arrived in @entity12 a decade ago from @entity110			0
he helped build one of the world 's first ice hotels , but claims music is his real passion			0
‘ my personal interest in this is to make it real music , not just clinking and dinking on a bunch of hanging ice cubes , ’ he told @entity116 in an interview			0
mr @entity124 claims that because ice is stiffer , it picks up all the vibrations , making the listener 's hair stand on end			0
' you might think the sound on a normal instrument is perfectly clear -- until you hear an ice instrument and go , " ah ha ! " the clarity is crystal , ' he said			0
