@entity3 was taken ill early 2012 when he was six months old and had an operation to remove his legs in march last year			1
the toddler also had to have all the fingers on his left hand amputated and the fingertips on his right hand removed			1
his devastated parents thought they would never see their son walk , but when @entity3 was given prosthetic legs in june 2012 they were given fresh hope when he was given a pair of prosthetic limbs			1
eventually after his big sister @entity6 , six , stood at the opposite side of their living room waving a bag of @entity33 which include gummy beras , and liquorice @entity3 shocked his parents @entity37 , 30 , and @entity38 , 31 , when he stood up on his prosthetic legs and walked across the room to help himself			1
now despite setbacks including chicken pox and eczema , little @entity3 has finally got used to wearing his new limbs and is using the slide and walks hand - in - hand with his parents like any other toddler			1
he can now manage over twenty steps at a time before he has to stop for a break			0
his mother @entity37 , a former teaching assistant from @entity53 , @entity51 said : ‘ doctors told us @entity3 may never walk , but we always remained positive because even though he was still so young we could already see how much of a determined little boy he was			1
‘ @entity3 can now walk 20 steps on his new legs before getting tired when @entity3 was given his new legs we were quite nervous			1
we worried that he might not be able to get used to them and for a while he was a bit unsure			0
@entity6 has been trying to get @entity3 to walk for ages and like all children @entity3 loves sweets , so @entity6 had the idea to hold sweets up to @entity3 to encourage him to walk			1
‘ i held @entity3 on one side of the room and his dad and sister stood at the opposite side of the living room holding @entity8 sweets out to @entity3			1
‘ we all watched him stand up and walk over to @entity6			2
he had such a determined look on his face and when he took his first steps we could n't believe it			0
‘ it was a fantastic moment			0
it was so emotional for all of us			0
’ the family set up the @entity81 ( @entity83 's @entity82 ) appeal to help buy the toddler the equipment needed to support him as he grows			2
they seek to raise £ 30,000 for a specialist downstairs wet room and bedroom for @entity3			2
@entity37 added : ‘ when we were first told @entity3 would have to have his legs amputated we were heartbroken			2
' he was just a baby and for @entity38 and i to have to see him so ill was devastating			0
louie with his mother @entity37 , at seven months old @entity3 's mother , @entity37 , described the moment that he began walking as very emotional ‘ @entity3 was in hospital for a total of eleven weeks and i stayed with him the whole time			1
‘ my husband @entity38 works as a welder and fabricator and he had to take care of our daughter , so he would travel from home to @entity106 to see us at weekends			0
‘ the legs @entity3 has now are his fourth pair because every time he grows he has to get a new pair			2
it 's a bit like when children @entity3 's age grow out of shoes really quickly			1
‘ @entity6 is so proud of her little brother			2
she was so excited when he walked for the first time			0
she could n't wait to tell everybody at school about it			0
‘ i go through feeling ecstatic at the fact that he is walking but then often a sadness comes over me because he has spent so long struggling			0
‘ he has been through so much in his early life			0
every week he is improving more and more			0
