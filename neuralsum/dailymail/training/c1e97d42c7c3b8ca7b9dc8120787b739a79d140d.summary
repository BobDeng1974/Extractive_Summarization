by @entity1 reporter published : 12:05 est , 11 november 2013 updated : 07:07 est , 12 november 2013 a police officer who faces getting fired for failing to return to work after the shooting at @entity4 last year has revealed his battle with post traumatic stress disorder			1
@entity7 said he is unable to forget the horrifying scenes he witnessed as one of the first responding police officers on december 14 , when a gunman shot dead 26 , including 20 children			1
speaking to the today show , he revealed he had an urge to self harm after the tragedy in @entity17 , @entity18 and that he often cried in his sleep - or struggled to sleep at all			2
' i ca n't describe the overwhelming senses of emotions that i had , ' he said			0
' that night i drank a lot			0
the next day , i wanted to cut myself because i just felt so numb			0
he spoke with a friend who was a @entity30 specialist and sought treatment , and a doctor recommended that he should not return to work			1
@entity7 is the only officer not to return to the department following the massacre , although at least 14 others missed work because of ptsd associated with the killings			1
he said he is now hopeful that the town keeps its promise to protect its officers			2
' they promised us – all of us , all the police officers – that if we do our job , and something happens , they ’re going to take care of us , ' he told the today show			0
' and they 're not holding up their word and that 's all we want them to do , for myself and for anybody else that this is going to happen to			0
' grisly memories : speaking to @entity66 next to a representative from his union , mr @entity7 said he would cry in the night and had an urge to self harm after witnessing the horrific scenes in august , @entity17 police chief @entity72 sent @entity7 a letter telling him that termination with the department was ' warranted and will be my recommendation to the @entity78 '			2
@entity72 asked mr @entity7 to meet with him ' to discuss the issue of whether termination of your employment is necessary due to the medical disability and your options if that is true			2
' they have n't given him many options			0
it 's either quit and get nothing , retire and get nothing or we will fire you and you get nothing , ' @entity17 police union president @entity88 told @entity94			0
@entity96 officials said they expect @entity7 to be dismissed because the town does not want to pick up the cost of paying half of his salary until he is eligible to retire - which is mandated by the union			1
@entity7 has been receiving long - term disability benefits , but the town 's insurance police will only cover two years of long - term disability			1
@entity107 : a police officer runs with teachers and a child during the terrifying incident in december 2012 site : the school is being demolished and the site should be entirely destroyed on the 1 - year anniversary ' the town tried to pinch some pennies by buying the wrong type of insurance policy , ' said @entity120 , attorney for the @entity96 , reported @entity121			1
' @entity122 acknowledges , based on his own reports , that he 's probably not going to be able to come back to work			0
the question is what type of benefit is he entitled to ? ' mr @entity120 said			0
@entity7 said he thinks other police officers would like to file disability claims but have returned to work because they fear the repercussions			1
' i believe some of them are afraid of what ’s going on , so now they ca n’t take care of themselves , because they ’re too worried about the financial , which is a huge burden , ' he said			0
last month the demolition of @entity4 began under a cloak of secrecy and security to discourage ghoulish souvenir - hunters			2
officials hope it will be completely dismantled by the one - year anniversary of the attack .			1

@entity7 was one of the first officers to respond to @entity4 after 26 were shot - including 20 children - last year
he suffers from flashbacks and *difficulty* sleeping and a doctor recommended he not return to work
but his department warned that he will be fired for not returning
he is now fighting the town for long - term disability benefits
