by @entity1 reporter published : 16:32 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 17:29 est , 2 october 2013 @entity2 : fewer than half of the people in the survey could recall when princess @entity6 died , even though it was only in 1997 the internet could be making us more forgetful , according to a study published yesterday , because it is so easy to ' @entity10 it ' the survey of 2,000 adults found fewer than half could name the year that princess @entity6 died , even though it only happened in 1997			1
less than one third knew the year in which the @entity18 fell and just 50 per cent were aware of when man first walked on the moon			1
remarkably , four in ten did n’t know the year in which the terrorist attacks on the @entity22 took place			1
as many as 87 per cent of those who took part said a ‘ heavy reliance ’ on the internet meant they made less of an effort to remember things ' because we can look them up '			2
the research , commissioned by @entity35 , examined the modern @entity37 ’s knowledge of famous historical events and the years in which they took place			2
the study launches @entity42 ’s ‘ @entity49 ’ campaign which will offer purchasers of every special bottle , a free newspaper front page reprint from any date in history since 1903			0
unsurprisingly , the most common date known was the @entity51 in 1066 , while the dates of the two @entity53 and @entity56 ’s @entity55 win were also ingrained on the nation ’s memory			1
a spokesman for @entity42 ’s @entity35 said : ' certain dates are impressed upon us a lot at school and tend to stick but clearly the art for remembering dates fades and it seems we are now retaining less			0
history : nine in 10 people could remember the @entity68 of @entity69 was , 1066 ' particularly in terms of recent events , for example people were four times more likely to know when @entity51 occurred than they were to know when the invasion of @entity76 took place			1
' the internet is an incredible resource which enriches and adds much to the quality of modern life , but it could be changing the traditional way we remember and process things - certainly compared to older generations			2
terrorist attacks : only six in ten could remember in what year 9/11 took place , 2001 ' perhaps the ability to know the exact dates of things is n’t so crucial , but it ’s important the human stories behind those events do n’t get lost and we never stop appreciating what ’s happened before			1
' it also emerged a concerned eight in ten people feel younger people today are less bothered with history , while the same number feels today ’s youth are raised to be more self - involved and less appreciative of what ’s gone before			0
in fact , 56 per cent thought that with 24/7 news and continuous updates on what ’s happening , there is less focus on past events nowadays			0
despite this , an overwhelming 88 per cent felt that learning and teaching history was still relevant even in an age where knowledge is just a mouse click away			0
the @entity42 ’s @entity35 spokesman added : ' @entity118 moments in history have made us who we are and offer great learnings			0
' there is nothing more powerful than hearing about a key historical event from the horse ’s mouth but we are clearly not doing enough of it			0
' the retelling of stories is not only a powerful way to educate the younger generation , but also a wonderful way of bringing generations together to spend quality time and nurturing a wonderful bond between them			0
' survey : less than one third knew the year in which the @entity18 fell , 1989			1

only six in ten could recall the year in which 9/11 took place
but 90 *%* were able to say the @entity51 was in 1066
