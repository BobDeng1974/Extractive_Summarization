if your favoured work out involves counting calories on high tech digital equipment and you enjoy a sauna and steam at the end of your session , then the @entity1 gym in the @entity2 is probably not for you			1
with muscle - bound gym goers using stacked tyres as a punch bag and free weights chained to the ground surrounded by unorthodox makeshift metal machines , the gym looks more like a scrapyard than a fitness centre			2
and you wo n't just be dripping with sweat should the heavens open during an intense workout			0
@entity24 : gym goers of all ages and fitness levels flock to @entity1 outdoor gym in @entity29 - because it 's free tough guys : men hit punching bags made out of tyres as they train at the @entity1 outdoor gym on the banks of river @entity37 working hard : a gym - goer works out on a makeshift chest press machine in a packed @entity1 gym outdoor workout : the @entity1 gym is the @entity2 answer to @entity46 's @entity45 ( pictured ) for @entity1 - perhaps the most hardcore outdoor gym in the world - is completely open to the elements			1
but formed in the early 1970s , the @entity2 's answer to @entity46 's @entity45 has increased in popularity over the last four decades and is now home to more than 200 different fitness machines			0
the brainchild of a @entity58 gymnast @entity57 and maths professor @entity59 , the 6.2 square mile outdoor fitness centre is located on the island of @entity61 right in the heart of the nation 's capital @entity29			1
unlike the luxury , members - only health clubs many of us are used to , @entity1 wo n't set you back an arm and a leg - you can work out there for free			2
packed : the gym , which was formed in the early 1970s , has grown in popularity over the past four decades fitness fanatics : the gym was founded by @entity58 gymnast @entity57 and maths professor @entity59 in the early 1970s unorthodox : the equipment , some of which looks more like torture machinery than something that belongs in a gym , is made mostly from old machinery and scrap metal put to new use : much of the equipment was made when scrap metal was at a surplus in the country during the @entity89 hardcore : an outdoor gym seemingly attended mostly by musclebound men , the @entity1 gym is a tough environment its name comes from the @entity98 word ' kachat ' which literally means ' to pump '			1
many of the machines were created when there was a surplus of scrap metal in the country during the @entity89 years and consist of spare parts from machines and vehicles			0
@entity110 tank chains and marine salvage parts have been roughly forged together to create the most primitive and basic of strength and resistance machines			0
made mostly of metal and wood , the machines are painted blue and most lack the luxury of padded seats or soft plastic coated pulleys			0
much of the equipment is chained to the ground so that it is n't stolen			0
onlooker : an older gym - goer waits patiently as youngsters aim for bigger biceps on some of the equipment bulking up : a young fitness fanatic struggles to push out one final rep as he attempts to build bigger muscles at @entity131 all ages welcome : an older woman stretches as she enjoys a workout at the huge outdoor fitness centre in @entity29 getting stronger : the name of the gym comes from the @entity98 word @entity138 which literally means ' to pump ' security : much of the equipment in the gym is chained to the ground so that it is not stolen			1

the @entity1 gym is a 6.2 square mile outdoor fitness centre on the island of @entity61 in the @entity98 capital
it was the brainchild of a @entity58 gymnast @entity57 and maths professor @entity59 and opened in the 1970s
most of the gym equipment is made from scrap metal , vehicle parts and chains taken from machinery
despite its lack of luxury the gym does have one *obvious* *advantage* - it 's free to work out there
