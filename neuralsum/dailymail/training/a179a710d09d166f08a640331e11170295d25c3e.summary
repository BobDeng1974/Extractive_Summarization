with the shock revelation that @entity2 and @entity3 had a furious bust - up following their @entity5 , @entity0 examines the role @entity2 ’s wife @entity7 played in the fallout at the @entity10 event and finds out who really holds the power behind @entity2 ’s throne ... after the birth of his second set of twins this summer , @entity2 faced a question similar to that of any newly - besotted father — when should he go back to work ? the prestigious @entity21 @entity20 was soon to start and he was scheduled to be there , so he consulted with his family , and above all wife @entity7 , about what to do			1
it did not sound like a long conversation			0
a few days later in @entity28 , a happy and smiling @entity2 recalled in jesting fashion : ‘ they said i should quickly come and play here			1
i said “ well , if you do n’t want me around i ’ll go away ”			0
’ @entity2 and @entity33 met at the @entity34 in 2000 and married in 2009 @entity7 watches @entity2 in action at @entity36 in 2012 with the pair 's twin daughters @entity37 and @entity40 @entity2 had a row with rival @entity3 after @entity2 's wife ' heckled ' him during their @entity5 finals match this response from mrs @entity33 was not unexpected , for she has always been driven in her support of her husband ’s career and , as a former player herself , fully understands that the business of tennis has to come first for now			1
perhaps more surprising was that @entity7 had got herself to @entity52 a fortnight later , along with their four children , in order to be in the stands for his opening match at the @entity20			1
it must have been quite a logistical effort with new twins @entity59 and @entity61 just three weeks old , but then their lives are famously well organised			2
and @entity7 is renowned for the steely back - up she provides for world - famous @entity2			1
@entity64 is an ever - present at the @entity67 star 's games , and shows the strain on day three at @entity36 in 2013 just how unbending that support can be was illustrated on saturday night in @entity10 , when she apparently upset his friend and opponent @entity3 with some well - chosen words			1
it can not always be easy to be married to a sporting phenomenon like @entity2 , who transcends tennis and has become as much its global ambassador as its most decorated player			1
he wields enormous power in the game and has an almost presidential status			0
that being the case , his wife might be akin to the @entity86			0
beyond the cliche of every successful man having a strong woman behind them , there is no question that @entity33 has played a considerable part in the achievements of her extraordinarily talented spouse			1
nobody who knows them well would tell you otherwise			0
‘ not much gets past @entity7 , ’ is how one confidant put it in assessing her influence			1
in most individual sports there is usually at least one family figure who has been disproportionately responsible for the success of an athlete — most often a parent — and particularly in tennis			2
@entity2 ’s father @entity110 and mother @entity111 have , however , been among the more relaxed of the breed and for most of his adult career it has been @entity7 , 36 , who has been a key force			1
critical to their successful and happy partnership has been her understanding and ambition , which derives itself from her own experiences as a professional whose career was cut short			0
as @entity33 , @entity7 emigrated with her parents from @entity124 to @entity67 at the age of two and her interest in tennis was fired by meeting @entity128 at a tournament seven years later			1
@entity7 emigrated with her parents from @entity124 to @entity67 at the age of two her interest in tennis was fired by meeting @entity128 at a tournament seven years later @entity2 , pictured with @entity64 at the @entity133 , says his wife has seen over 900 matches she went on to become a decent player , reaching no 76 in the world			1
the @entity67 writer @entity137 , author of @entity2 ’s biography , illustrated her innate determination by relating how , as a junior , she once journeyed through civil war - riven @entity141 just to play a tournament			1
most significantly for her life , it took her to the @entity34 in 2000 , where she met the 20 - year - old @entity2			1
her career was not to flourish as his did and within two years she retired with a persistent foot injury			0
from then on she dedicated herself to her boyfriend ’s career , starting as his public relations conduit but then becoming indispensable in all areas			0
in 2009 they married and she gave birth to their first set of twins , @entity40 and @entity37			1
these days she rarely speaks publicly but is very visible in @entity2 ’s support box and behind the scenes , where she is seen as a quietly formidable figure			2
in a rare interview with @entity67 magazine @entity162 , she emphasised the value of her own tennis knowledge , saying , ‘ that ’s why we get along so perfectly			1
no other woman could deal with so much tennis			0
if he wants to sleep long i definitely wo n’t wake him by getting up early			0
’ @entity169 and @entity170 there was no love lost between the two @entity174 greats , but it was a surprise when their ugliest spat came in an exhibition match			0
after trading comments , @entity170 crossed the net to confront @entity169 , who pushed his opponent away			0
@entity181 and @entity182 @entity182 enraged @entity181 when he patted the @entity174 on the cheek after a five - set victory			0
in his book , @entity181 wrote : ‘ apart from the fact it was a disdainful gesture , he almost took my toupee off			0
’ @entity188 and @entity189 an otherwise ordinary meeting in @entity28 in 2008 came to life when @entity189 sparked an ugly argument by insulting @entity188 ’s mother , @entity193			2
however , she clearly expects to come into her own when @entity2 ’s body can no longer take the grind of the circuit			2
referring to his lofty status as a player she said : ‘ you are that only once in your life			2
my time is still coming			0
’ for now she serves as a multi-tasker extraordinaire , gatekeeper to her massively in - demand husband as well as his emotional and practical support			2
she also has major input into his ‘ look ’ and fashion adventures , a few of which have backfired			1
it is said she even supervises the way he has his hair cut			0
@entity2 has often said how grateful he is to her for providing the stability and family happiness that is his inspiration			2
the spat with @entity3 is an exception to the smooth running of their lives			0
the verbals from courtside perhaps tell of something she has in common with her husband : underneath it all lies a supreme competitor			0
@entity233 surprised by @entity2 withdrawal			2

@entity33 emigrated with her parents from @entity124 to @entity67
her interest in tennis was fired by meeting @entity128
