a fixture which began during @entity2 has evolved into one of football ’s most dramatic duels , helped along by the presence of the greatest players on the planet and some very short fuses			0
@entity10 or @entity11 ? @entity12 or @entity13 ? @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 ... when it comes to @entity24 superpowers @entity16 and @entity17 , the flow of talent seems endless			1
add passion and the @entity27 ‘ temperament ’ and this is a match with a history of tantrums , too			0
@entity10 celebrates after @entity16 win the 1970 @entity30 in one of football 's most iconic images played 95 @entity34 40 draw 24 @entity35 31 @entity38 , then , for being able to host the @entity36 at the @entity37 on saturday			1
a normal two - legged clash will be decided by a one - off match this year			0
both countries have replaced their managers – @entity43 and @entity44 are the new coaches – since the @entity30 , which ended so miserably for hosts @entity16			1
@entity18 is back for @entity16 , @entity12 is fit and raring to go for @entity17 and the ingredients are there for yet another memorable meeting			1
@entity50 takes a look at 10 previous clashes which hit the headlines , not always for the football			1
@entity11 holds aloft the @entity30 in 1986 in a remarkably similar image to that taken in 1986 june 2012 : @entity17 4 @entity16 3 ( friendly , @entity58 ) these two countries tend not to do ‘ friendlies ’ for obvious reasons but @entity16 wanted top - class opposition as they prepared for the @entity63 in @entity64 and they certainly got it			1
@entity12 scored a hat - trick , including a winner with a few minutes to go			0
@entity69 and @entity70 were both sent off for an ‘ altercation ’ in injury time			0
for the record , @entity16 ’s scorers were @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 while @entity78 was the other @entity34 who found the net			1
@entity12 celebrates one of his three goals against @entity16 in @entity58 in 2012 @entity83 escapes the attentions of @entity76 in the same game in 2012 find out who we 've picked in our best ever @entity34 and @entity89 sides june 1990 : @entity17 1 @entity16 0 ( @entity30 , @entity90 ) @entity11 ’s sublime pass and @entity93 ’s deadly finish earned @entity17 the win but this was all about the post-match shenanigans , since confirmed by the big mouth of @entity98			1
@entity99 of @entity16 was given a bottle of water by the @entity34 backroom staff as they treated an injured player and claimed afterwards that it was doped with tranquilisers			2
@entity17 furiously denied the accusation but the ‘ @entity108 ’ , as it was dubbed did happen – @entity11 spilled the beans on a tv show later			2
just to really ram it home , @entity17 ’s favourite football chant , to the tune of @entity114 by @entity115 , relives that very match			1
lyrics as follows : @entity16 tell me how it feels / to have your father at home / i swear to you that even though years go by / we will never forget / that @entity11 [ @entity98 ] dribbled you / then @entity123 [ @entity93 ] scored against you / you 're crying since @entity124 / and you 'll see @entity12 / he will bring us the @entity30 / @entity98 is greater than @entity10 september 2006 : @entity16 3 @entity17 0 ( friendly , @entity126 , @entity64 ) @entity127			1
yes , @entity89 commentators had a field day with @entity18 ’s name after the most amazing goals from the substitute			0
@entity18 took possession just outside his own ‘ d ’ , set off on a jet - fuelled run , leaving a certain @entity12 in his wake , before drifting out to his right and scoring from an acute angle			0
anyone in north @entity64 that night had a treat			0
@entity18 slots home after an incredible run as @entity17 are beaten at the @entity126 back in 2006 kaka - back in the @entity16 squad for saturday 's game in @entity146 - was in his prime in 2006 july 1991 : @entity17 3 @entity16 2 ( @entity148 , @entity149 ) the tally of goals equalled the number of red cards in yet another tasty meeting between the two old foes			1
@entity156 scored for @entity17 in the first minute , cancelled out by @entity99 , who presumably was not accepting dodgy drinks from anyone			2
@entity156 and @entity20 put @entity17 into a 3 - 1 lead			2
now for the sendings - off : @entity93 and @entity162 went for a fight in the first half , @entity165 and @entity167 ditto in the second			0
@entity169 followed , having been on the pitch just a few minutes			0
august 2008 : @entity17 3 @entity16 0 ( @entity63 , @entity146 ) this semi-final was supposed to be all about @entity12 v @entity172 , who both played for @entity174 , but @entity175 took centre stage instead			1
former @entity177 midfielder @entity83 was also to play a pivotal part and , again , there were red cards			0
@entity16 finished with nine men after having @entity182 , also of @entity177 , and @entity183 sent off in the last 10 minutes , both for tackles on @entity83			1
watched by @entity11 , @entity175 scored twice in five minutes , with suggestions that the first hit his hand			0
@entity175 also won the penalty as he drew a challenge from @entity190 and @entity21 scored from the spot			0
@entity175 celebrates one of his two goals against @entity16 at the @entity194 @entity175 and @entity12 tormented the @entity89 defence that day before going on to win gold february 1937 : @entity17 2 @entity16 0 @entity197 ( @entity198 , @entity199 ) as the countries were tied after the group stage of what was to become the @entity148 , @entity199 hosted a play - off decider			1
there had already been ill - feeling with @entity34 fans accused of racist chanting – they called @entity16 ’s player macaquitos ( monkeys ) too			2
when the @entity16 team heard further chants , they walked off the pitch and left the stadium before the match was finished			1
the match is known as ‘ the game of shame ’			2
june 2005 : @entity16 4 @entity17 1 ( @entity218 , @entity219 ) football was the winner here , in the traditional @entity223 warm - up tournament			1
@entity16 were two up within the first quarter of an hour through @entity225 and @entity18			2
@entity172 volleyed goal no 3 before @entity225 wrapped up the scoring for @entity16			2
all @entity17 had to cheer was a late header from @entity229			2
just three weeks earlier @entity17 had beaten their old foes in a @entity30 qualifier			2
@entity172 scores @entity16 's third goal on their way to stuffing @entity17 4 - 1 in @entity235 in 2005 june 1978 : @entity17 0 @entity16 0 ( @entity30 , @entity236 ) once again , the story was not so much the match , which was an attritional scoreless draw , but what went on afterwards			1
both countries were tied on three points at the top of their group so making their final group fixture crucial			0
@entity16 beat @entity246 3 - 1 during the day , which left hosts @entity17 knowing they needed to win by four goals			1
they duly crushed @entity250 6 - 0 amid allegations of match - rigging			0
it was as a result of that that @entity255 decided to make the final group games kick off at the same time			0
july 1982 : @entity16 3 @entity17 1 ( @entity30 , @entity174 ) a proper @entity257 pitted @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity124 together and it was @entity17 who missed out although @entity11 , who had just signed for @entity174 from @entity259 , managed to grab plenty of headlines with a red card for kicking @entity263			1
a @entity89 side with names like @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 and @entity269 proved too good for @entity17			0
@entity266 and @entity267 both scored with the third coming from @entity270			0
@entity269 ( the original ) has a shot on goal against @entity17 at the 1982 @entity30 february 1946 : @entity17 2 @entity16 0 ( @entity198 , @entity199 ) players fought with police , fans invaded the pitch and both teams had to go to the dressing rooms while order was restored in a match which has gone down in folklore in @entity24			1
the spark was ignited when both @entity284 and @entity285 went for the same ball – and @entity34 captain @entity285 ’s leg was broken in two places			0
tempers flared and chaos ensued			0
@entity285 never played professional football again .			0
