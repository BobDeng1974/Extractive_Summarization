builder @entity0 , 51 , is currently serving life for kidnapping and beating to death 18 month old @entity12 with a shovel			1

he said he listened as @entity33 told him how @entity16 and @entity5 were innocent of the murder , which had been in fact committed by an unidentified friend of his			2
@entity0 said : ' we were in the exercise yard and @entity33 approached me and said he had something to say			1
he wanted us to get away from the other inmates and away from the cameras			2
' he said that his appeal was coming up and he did n't know whether to tell the truth or not			2
he said that the real version of events was different from what had been said on the tv			2

as he spoke @entity16 , dressed in an ankle length floral pattern white dress and blue top listened intently , occasionally making notes or picking on points with her lawyer			2
@entity0 said : ' @entity33 asked me what benefits he would get if he told the truth			1
he then said that he had met @entity2 in a bar with some friends of his - one was called @entity78			1
' he said that one had got drunk and that he had followed @entity2 home to see where she lived			1
a few days later he said he and this drunk friend went back to the house to see @entity2			1
' they asked her if she would like to have a threesome and she had told them to leave			2
@entity85 said he then went to the bathroom and that when he came back the scene was very different			2
' he said that @entity2 was on the floor , back down , and that his friend was holding her down by the arms before they swapped positions			1
@entity0 claims @entity2 , who was jailed over the killing of @entity2 , told him @entity1 was innocent of murder ' @entity85 then told me that he had put a small ivory handled knife to her throat and that it had cut her and his hands were full of blood			1
he said that his friend had said : ' we need to finish her off or we will rot in jail			2
' @entity0 added that @entity33 had told him his friend had then fled the house and he had tried to stem the blood from @entity2 's wound before fleeing himself from the scene in @entity52 , @entity110			1
he added how the two had then met up in a nightclub and @entity33 had told him his friend had given him a bundle of cash and told him : ' now get out of @entity110			0
' @entity33 - who denies @entity0 's claims - went on the run and was eventually arrested in @entity117 before being extradited back to @entity110 in december 2007 , a month after @entity2 was murdered			1
he was later convicted of murder and sexual assault and given theory years before this was reduced to appeal to 18 years and confirmed by the @entity110 @entity122			0
@entity0 added that while in jail together in 2009 he and @entity33 were watching a news report on @entity16 and @entity5 's conviction and he had said : ' well done judge ' to which they had argued violently			1
@entity0 said : ' i told him how could he say that when he had told me they were innocent of murder			1
we had a bit of a fight about it			0
i had told him to tell the truth			0
after that we did n't really speak again			0
' during cross examination from @entity139 , the @entity140 family , lawyer , @entity0 was shown a picture of little @entity12 and asked : ' you are serving life for the murder of this child			1
do you recognise him ? ' mr @entity0 said @entity2 told him that ' the real version of events is different to what has been said on tv ' to which he replied : ' no , ' with mr @entity139 adding : ' well we all remember him			1
you are also serving a sentence for sexual assault - we say you are lying			0
' the court then also heard from @entity156 , who is serving time for robbery and possession of a firearm , he had to give his evidence from behind a screen as he has turned informer the court heard			0
surrounded by three armed guards @entity156 said that while in prison he had also heard from @entity0 what @entity33 had told him and that other inmates were also aware of his claims that @entity16 and @entity5 were innocent			1
the last to testify was convicted mobster @entity169 , 42 , who told the court his brother had carried out the murder and given him the keys to the house as well as a bloody knife to hide			0
@entity169 said the murder had been ordered because his brother @entity177 , had been promised 15,000 @entity178 to help steal a valuable painting that was in the house			0
flanked by two prison guards @entity169 , from @entity182 , said : ' my family does n't work , how shall we say , legitimately so it did n't surprise me that he was asked to do this job			0
' he added : ' the night of november 1 i was watching tv and my brother came into the house			0
the sleeves of his jacket were ripped and he had deep scratches on his arms			0
' there was blood on him			0
i saw sticking out of his pocket a piece of cloth and inside there was a closed flick knife and a set of keys			0
i asked him to tell me what had happened			0
' @entity169 then described how his brother had entered the house with the keys and had been looking for the painting when they were disturbed by a woman ' wearing a dressing gown			0
' the flat where @entity2 was found brutally murdered in @entity52 , @entity110 , has since been put back up for rent he added : ' my brother told me that he had put his hand to her mouth but she had struggled			1
he said he got the knife and stabbed her before they had run off			0
he said they had also smashed a window to simulate a break in			0
' @entity169 went on to describe how he had hidden the keys and the knife and said : ' there was a wall by the house where i live			0
i took out a stone and put the keys and knife in there and covered it with earth			0
' he added : ' inside me i know that a miscarriage of justice has taken place , ' also adding that he had been in the same jail as @entity5 and had told him : ' i believe in your innocence			0
' under cross examination from the prosecution it emerged that @entity169 had also been convicted seven times of defamation to which he angrily replied : ' that 's because all of you , the judiciary are a clan			0
' back in 2009 the court was told how dna from @entity16 had been found on the handle of a 30cm kitchen knife recovered form @entity5 's kitchen and that of @entity2 was on the tip. however it ha since emerged that the results were so low they would not have been admitted as evidence in any other trial and the experts are examining the methods used			1
as a result there is a growing unease over the safety of the conviction as the prosecution 's motive has also changed several times from sex game gone wrong , to a bungled break , to a domestic row between @entity16 and @entity2			2
@entity2 , from @entity274 , @entity275 , was a @entity276 student in @entity52 as part of her degree course and had only been in @entity110 for two months before she was murdered in november 2007 .			2
