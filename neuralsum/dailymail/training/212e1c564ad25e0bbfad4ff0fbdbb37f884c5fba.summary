by @entity0 published : 08:48 est , 24 january 2013 updated : 10:19 est , 24 january 2013 @entity2 military recruits are to be checked for certain types of tattoo which authorities believe could reveal signs of homosexuality under new technical guidelines issued from the @entity9			1
conscripts and contract soldiers should be given a thorough physical examination looking for tattoos in intimate places , the @entity11 's central administration recommends			1
the guidelines , which are based on a military psychology textbook from 2005 , specify that special attention should be paid to tattoos near the face , sexual organs and buttocks , which could reveal possible sexual deviations			1
tattoo checks : recruits joining the @entity2 military are to be examined for any intimate tattoos which could reveal homosexuality under new guidelines issued by the @entity9 checkups : recruits show doctors their tongues , during a medical examination in the @entity37 city of @entity38 the text reads : ' the reason for getting tattoos could indicate a low cultural or educational level			1
' if an influence by external factors is determined , for example , persuasion or direct coercion , this indicates the malleability of the young man , his disposition to submit to another 's will			0
' the guide also outlines a range of warning signs for potential mental instability which include early sexual experience and ' uncontrolled sexual behavior '			2
@entity9 : many within the @entity2 government are against the promotion of homosexuality and western values officers are advised to chat with conscripts about their sexual experience and conduct			1
the physical examination should take place after the recruit has been quizzed about family , everyday life , success in school and attitudes toward alcohol			2
the guide offers advice on various issues , from how to spot an ' opinion - shaper ' and ' natural - born leader ' within the ranks to what role religious and ethnic aspects will have inside the barracks			0
however many officers have already rejected the guidelines claiming they would be impractical to implement			1
one unnamed battalion chief assistant told @entity2 's @entity90 newspaper : ' i just physically ca n't so confidentially hold a discussion with each new recruit			1
the commanders do that anyway			0
' what will they do , examine their genitals for any tattoos ? and how will they ask about someone 's first sexual experience ? ' hey , when did you have your first woman , rookie ? answer directly , no beating around the bush ! ' " while the @entity2 military holds traditional views on sexuality , a @entity106 report from 2007 stated homosexuality and male prostitution is common within the army			1
the @entity113 found that some soldiers voluntarily offer their services while others are forced into prostitution			2
the battalion chief assistant added : ' i had one gay contract soldier who joined just to find more partners for himself			2
for people like that , of course , there 's no place in the army			0
' the move is the latest in a series of proposed clampdowns on homosexuality including new legislation which aims to promote traditional values			1
under the terms of a bill that comes up for a first vote later this month , a public kiss between two men could be defined as illegal ' homosexual propaganda ' and bring a fine of up to £ 10,000 the legislation being pushed by the @entity9 and the @entity142 would make it illegal to tell minors information that is defined as ‘ propaganda of sodomy , lesbianism , bisexuality and transgenderism			0
’ it also includes a ban on holding public events that promote gay rights			0
controversial : officers detain gay right activists during a protest in december in @entity157			2
a bill banning ' homosexual propaganda ' comes up for the first of three votes this month the bill is part of an effort to promote traditional @entity2 values as opposed to @entity167 liberalism , which the @entity9 and church see as corrupting @entity2 youth and contributing to a wave of protest against president @entity173 's rule , @entity162 reported			1
other laws that the @entity9 says are intended to protect young @entity2 have been adopted in recent months , including some that allow banning and blocking web content and print publications that are deemed ‘ extremist ’ or unfit for young audiences			1
@entity181 , a sociologist with the @entity182 , an independent pollster , says the anti-gay bill fits the ‘ general logic ’ of a government intent on limiting various rights			0
but in this case , the move has been met mostly with either indifference or open enthusiasm by average @entity2			1
protest : @entity2 police officers detain a gay rights activist during an attempt to hold a gay pride parade in @entity157 in may 2012 @entity182 polls conducted last year show that almost two thirds of @entity2 find homosexuality ‘ morally unacceptable and worth condemning			1
’ about half are against gay rallies and same - sex marriage ; almost a third think homosexuality is the result of ‘ a sickness or a psychological trauma , ’ the @entity182 surveys show			1
@entity2 's widespread hostility to homosexuality is shared by the political and religious elite			1
lawmakers have accused homosexuals of decreasing @entity2 's already low birth rates and said they should be barred from government jobs , undergo forced medical treatment or be exiled			1
@entity218 activists criticised @entity220 company @entity219 for using a ‘ gay ’ rainbow on cartons of its dairy products			0
a man dressed in a bridal gown screams out of a police vehicle after he was detained in a gay rights protest in december , @entity228 , founder of gay - rights group the @entity230 , was pelted with eggs by militant activists with the @entity142 seconds after he and his boyfriend kissed			0
he was arrested by police , fined £ 10 and detained for 30 hours first in a frozen van and then in an unheated detention centre			0
the @entity218 activists were also rounded up , but were released much earlier			0
those behind the bill say minors need to be protected from ‘ homosexual propaganda ’ because they are unable to evaluate the information critically			0
the bill reads : ‘ this propaganda goes through the mass media and public events that propagate homosexuality as normal behavior '			2
@entity2 cities started adopting anti-gay laws in 2006			2
only one person has been prosecuted so far under a law specifically targeted at homosexuals : @entity252 , a gay rights campaigner , was fined the equivalent of £ 100 after a one - man protest last summer in @entity255			0
in november , a @entity255 court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the @entity258 , a small group of @entity218 conservatives and @entity173 loyalists , against pop star @entity261			0
the group sought £ 6.7million in damages for what it says was ‘ propaganda of perversion ’ when @entity261 spoke up for gay rights during a show three months earlier			0
@entity2 special police forces arrest a homosexual activist			1
homosexuals are subject to official pressure and persistent homophobia the federal bill 's expected adoption comes 20 years after a stalinist - era law punishing homosexuality with up to five years in prison was removed from @entity2 's penal code as part of the democratic reforms that followed the @entity283 's collapse			1
most of the other former soviet republics also decriminalised homosexuality , and attitudes toward gays have become a litmus test of democratic freedoms			0
while gay pride parades are held in the three former @entity283 @entity294 states , all today members of the @entity296 , same - sex love remains a crime in authoritarian @entity298 and @entity299			0
in @entity2 , homosexuals have been subject to official pressure and persistent homophobia			2
there are no reliable estimates of how many gay men and women live in @entity2 , and only a few big cities such as @entity157 and @entity255 have gay nightclubs and gyms			2
even there , homosexuals do not feel secure .			0

conscripts and contract soldiers to be given a thorough examination
special attention to tattoos near the face , sexual organs and buttocks
but many officers have already rejected the ' impractical ' guidelines
comes amid recent *backlash* against homosexuality and @entity167 values
almost a third of @entity2 think homosexuality is result of ' a sickness '
