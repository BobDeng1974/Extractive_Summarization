have you ever been to @entity1 ? the whole place is like a museum			0
and i do n't mean that in a positive way			0
it 's not all quaint cottages , and olde - world @entity9			0
it 's a grim relic of a bygone era , a town stuck in the past that may never catch up with the rest of the modern world			0
@entity18 celebrates scoring for @entity19 against arch rivals @entity20 at @entity21 in april 2012 @entity22 ( centre ) grabs @entity24 during a heated @entity25 in october 2007 the feisty @entity25 ( pictured is @entity26 seeing red in march 2012 ) is the biggest game in @entity29 i lived there briefly , i think i 'm all right now though			1
the football equivalent of @entity33 is the @entity35 domestic scene			0
people try to avoid it , there is nothing of interest there			0
and the decline of @entity35 club football has been brought into startling focus with this weekend 's draw for the @entity47 semi-finals			2
when @entity19 and @entity20 were paired up for one of the ties , it instantly became the biggest game in the history of @entity35 domestic football			1
that might seem ridiculous but when you think it through , it 's true			0
the @entity59 derby games are always massive , and they 're always the biggest games of the season			2
so that makes this one the biggest @entity35 club football will see this campaign			2
@entity20 ' @entity64 smiles down on @entity19 's @entity65 after hitting him with a tackle in 1987 @entity19 are languishing in the league under @entity68 , despite striker @entity70 's good run of form but it 's so much more than that , and here are the reasons why it 's the biggest fixture ever : 1 ) never before has @entity29 had to wait so long for an @entity25 clash			1
when this semi-final takes place , it will be two years and nine months since the last time @entity19 and @entity20 locked horns			1
2 ) never before have @entity20 had such a massive point to prove			1
the fans feel they have been let down by the previous owners of the club , and those running the game north of the border			1
3 ) not for many years have @entity19 been in such a shocking state			1
strangers to the @entity90 and scrapping their way back up the table , jostling for position with the likes of @entity95 and @entity96 as they chase down @entity97 at the top			0
@entity99 preferred to be at @entity100 at the foot of the championship than slum it at @entity21			0
it 's a period of humiliation for the once - great @entity19			1
and while @entity20 have been similarly humiliated , @entity19 's embarrassment has n't been imposed on them			1
4 ) never before has the @entity35 domestic game been so moribund that literally everybody who cares about football in @entity29 was desperate for this fixture to come in one of the cup competitions			2
the circumstances both clubs find themselves in , and the hunger for a long - awaited , hotly - anticipated @entity25 game make this , in my opinion , the biggest club game in @entity29 ever			1
it 's a sad state for @entity35 football to find itself in			0
@entity99 preferred to scrap it out at the foot of the @entity102 with @entity100 than stay north of the border			2

@entity19 play @entity20 in the @entity128 semi-finals
the @entity25 is the biggest game north of the border
but this takes on added *importance* after two years without a clash
