by @entity0 published : 09:41 est , 19 november 2013 updated : 10:24 est , 19 november 2013 a @entity2 father has been reunited with his family after he was wrongly accused of abusing his baby daughter , but it turned out she has a rare bone disease that causes her fragile bones to break			1
@entity8 was changing little @entity10 's diaper in august 2012 when he heard a pop. he and his wife @entity12 rushed the child to a @entity15 hospital where doctors discovered she had a broken leg , but also noticed other broken bones and mr @entity8 was eventually arrested for child abuse			1
both parents were in shock			0
finally , mr @entity8 , pictured right in his mug shot , was cleared ' halfway through my police interview , they told me that they believed that @entity8 had been systematically abusing @entity10 and her fractures were at varying stages of healing , ' mrs @entity12 told @entity40			1
' i had been married to this monster that i never met			0
' but this conclusion just did n't make sense , particularly as @entity10 's pediatrician had never seen any problems and the family 's nanny reported seeing no signs of abuse			2
' i had to step back and intellectualize and say could this have even happened , ' mrs @entity12 said			0
' let me not be blinded by my love but let me go through and make sure i 'm doing everything to protect our daughter			0
' confused : mrs @entity12 , right , did n't believe that her husband , left , was a monster when police told her of the alleged abuse sad : mr @entity8 was kept away from his daughter , @entity10 , for 14 months while police investigated why her bones were breaking so while mr @entity8 was in and out of court , she took @entity10 to specialists across the @entity64 , searching for answers			1
eventually , the family came across another mother named @entity68 whose twin girls had been removed from her until a geneticist named dr. @entity71 diagnosed them with @entity72 or @entity72 ' one of the main symptoms is the underlying structure of the body , including the bones and joints , is fragile			2
so you get more fractures , ' dr. @entity71 told @entity40			0
rare condition : while mr @entity8 was in and out of court , mrs @entity12 took @entity10 , pictured left and right , to specialists across the @entity64 , searching for answers relief : now the family is all back together after the diagnosis ' and therefore , just handling a baby routinely , like any parent would do , can lead to a fracture			1
' @entity10 and mrs @entity12 were both diagnosed with @entity72 , though the mother said she had never heard of the disease			1
thankfully , the discovery also set mr @entity8 free , after more than a year spent away from his wife and daughter			2
' right now it 's just a joy to be back home and have the house , ' mr @entity8 said			2
' that 's far outweighing the anger			0
the happiness to have my girls back			0

@entity2 dad @entity8 was arrested for abusing his daughter @entity10 in august 2012 after her leg broke while she was changing her diaper
he and his wife @entity12 rushed the child to a @entity15 hospital where doctors noticed other broken bones
mr @entity8 was eventually taken into *custody* and was kept from his daughter for 14 months
@entity10 was later diagnosed @entity72 or @entity72 , which means her bones and joints fracture very easily and mr @entity8 was cleared
