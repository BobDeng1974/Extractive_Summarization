for football fans , transfer deadline day can be the most - anticipated event of the year			2
it gives struggling clubs a chance to bolster their squad once last time - and teams at the opposite end of the table the opportunity to get even stronger			1
but they only have until 11pm on monday to do so ! here , @entity12 examines what questions will be answered once the clock strikes that very time			1
1 - will @entity16 land a striker ? with @entity19 injured and @entity20 doing a weekly impression of @entity22 on ice , @entity18 are desperate for additional firepower			1
they missed out on @entity26 , who signed for @entity27 on sunday , and fellow target @entity28 is set for @entity29			0
@entity38 would love to bring him to the @entity40 and with @entity41 agreeing to join @entity42 on loan they could avoid any financial fair play regulations			1
if @entity38 get @entity31 they will surely be favourites to pip @entity27 to the title			1
should i stay or should i go ? @entity31 is linked with joining both @entity18 and @entity38 loan : @entity41 joining @entity42 would open up the door for @entity31 according to @entity50 rules 3 - which @entity52 flops will be shown the door ? @entity54 is off to @entity55 and @entity56 has rejoined @entity57 but who else can @entity58 shift ? @entity60 ( @entity61 and @entity62 ) , @entity63 ( @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity42 ) and @entity66 ( is anyone desperate enough ? ) could yet leave			1
leaving ? @entity52 and @entity67 striker @entity60 is on @entity61 and @entity62 's shortlists free to a good home : @entity63 ( left ) and @entity66 ( right ) could be on their way out of @entity72 @entity73 and @entity74 have enough charm to save @entity52 ’s squad ? apart from up front , @entity52 are desperate for reinforcements , despite the arrival of @entity80 from @entity81			1
they need a right back and a centre back , and a tough - tackling midfielder would not go amiss			2
@entity86 ’s @entity85 fits that bill , though do n’t be surprised if there are no more big arrivals			0
you 'll do nicely : @entity85 fits the bill for what @entity52 manager @entity58 needs 5 - will @entity93 end his @entity27 career ? he ’s won three @entity96 titles , the @entity97 and a whole lot more , but is @entity93 ’s glove affair with @entity27 set to end ? and if so , will he find a club in time ? @entity101 are very keen on him and @entity39 have shown interest , too			1
@entity27 have one too many foreign players for their 25 - man squad , so need to shift someone			2
the end ? goalkeeper @entity93 could leave after becoming second - string to @entity108 at @entity27 6 - how many bodies can @entity109 get in at @entity111 ? @entity112 left @entity111 because of disagreements over transfers			2
@entity109 has just a few hours left to shore up his squad with @entity118 midfielder @entity117 top of his list			0
having played for him at @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 and @entity125 , it might be worth @entity126 sitting by the phone , too			0
thinking cap on : new @entity111 manager @entity109 will keep his eyes open on transfer deadline day 7 - can @entity131 resist a deadline - day deal ? it would n’t be deadline day without @entity62 trying to make dramatic late signings			1
@entity131 loves a bargain and is a shrewd negotiator			0
and after watching his side being dismantled by @entity139 , he might be persuaded to get more involved than before			0
@entity60 is a target to come in while @entity141 , @entity142 and @entity143 could leave			0
any bargains ? it would n't be deadline day without @entity62 's @entity131 trying for dramatic late signings 8 - will @entity147 play for @entity148 again ? he ’s only been in @entity149 a few months and he ’s out with a groin injury at the moment , but @entity147 is hoping he can be reunited with @entity148			2
the @entity125 boss always gets the best out of the former @entity67 striker and they need a replacement for @entity26			0
together again ? @entity147 may rejoin @entity148 at @entity125 as a replacement for striker @entity26 9 - does @entity158 want first - team football ? nine @entity96 appearances in the past two seasons is not something @entity163 will be proud of			1
so will he follow @entity166 ’s path and leave @entity38 for @entity167 ? he is only 26 and needs to prove that he is hungry to play again			2
fancy first - team football , @entity169 ? @entity163 could follow @entity166 from @entity38 to @entity167 10 - who will win the race for @entity173 defender @entity172 ? with a cool name like @entity172 , you can see why so many clubs want @entity177			1
@entity173 are insistent that he is going nowhere but @entity179 are determined to seal an £ 8m deal			0
if they do n’t , @entity181 and @entity167 are also interested			0
after conceding six against @entity27 , maybe @entity61 should be , too			0
en route ? @entity172 is wanted by @entity179 on an £ 8m deal but @entity173 insist he 's going nowhere			0

will @entity18 manager @entity16 land an all - *important* striker in time ?
@entity38 look to lure @entity31 from @entity39 on monday
will @entity58 and @entity74 sign anyone for @entity52 ?
@entity12 looks at all the questions that will be answered by monday 11pm
