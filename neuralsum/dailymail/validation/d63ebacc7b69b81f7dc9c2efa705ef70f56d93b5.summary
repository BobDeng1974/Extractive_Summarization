a family dog was nearly blinded , its owner has said , by an allergic reaction after it was groomed at a @entity4 mega-store			1
@entity5 , 20 , from @entity6 paid £ 36 for his 20 - month - old @entity8 terrier @entity9 to have the treatment			1
but when he took his beloved pooch home he was shocked to see the dog struggling to breathe and unable to open her eyes			1
@entity5 ( left ) with his younger brother @entity16 ( right ) with @entity9 @entity17 rushed @entity9 to the vets where they discovered she had suffered an allergic reaction to the shampoo			1
' we all thought she was going to die , ' mr @entity5 said			1
' she could have had a heart attack , it was beating so fast			0
her eyes were red and she would n't open them and she was drooling a lot			0
' @entity9 was walking into things so we thought she could have also gone blind			1
everyone was so worried about her , she is part of the family and my brothers and sisters were in tears			0
' i think it 's disgraceful what happened			0
you do n't expect anything like this to happen to your dog when you put it in the hands of licensed and trained professionals			0
' she 's improving now thanks to a course of eye drops they vet gave to her but it 's a very slow process			0
' i fear she will have eyesight problems in the future because of this and may go blind			0
' my father went to the @entity55 to tell them to stop using chemicals because our dog almost died			1
when @entity61 took his dog to the vets its eyes were red and aggravated , it was drooling excessively and had a rapid heart rate and temperature			1
the symptoms appeared to have been caused by a grooming seesion ' it took them three days to respond to our complaint and they never even asked us how @entity9 was or said sorry for what happened			1
i think it 's disgraceful and appalling			0
' @entity9 fell ill an hour after having a shampoo , wash and haircut at the @entity80 salon based at @entity55 in @entity81 , @entity82			1
the family were landed with a £ 102 vet 's bill			2
@entity55 have launched an investigation into the grooming products that were used on @entity9 ' @entity9 was reluctant to open her eyelids , which appeared swollen with yellow purulent discharge coming from both eyes , ' @entity88 at @entity89 in @entity91 - under - @entity90 , said			1
she explained that parts of both of the dog 's eyes were red and inflamed and the dog was drooling far more than usual			2
' it could have been worse had they not brought her in on sunday			0
she looked in a bad state and distressed and i 'm glad they brought @entity9 to see me			2
i do n't know for certain what caused it , but it could have been a reaction to something , ' ms @entity88 said			2
@entity55 have launched an investigation into the products they use on dogs			1
a spokesman said : ' our @entity117 colleagues are all highly trained and use only specifically formulated products which have a history of use in pet grooming			0
' when washing dogs , great care is taken to avoid shampoo coming into contact with a dog 's eyes			2
' this was certainly the case with @entity9 so we were very surprised to learn of her reaction			2
' the products used with @entity9 are common to all 179 @entity132 around the country and we have seen no other cases of dogs being affected in this way			0
' it was not the first time a customer of the grooming service in @entity82 had taken their dog home to find it was dangerously unwell , the @entity137 reported			0
@entity145 , owner of another @entity146 , says her pet went through a similar experience last year after going to the @entity4 store			0
she had to pay £ 470 in vets bills for four visits and two eye surgeries after she was told by her vet that her dog could go blind			0
@entity9 fell ill an hour after having a shampoo , wash and haircut at the @entity80 salon based at @entity55 in @entity81 , @entity158 - on - @entity159 @entity61 with @entity9 , the builder was worried the family 's beloved dog had died from the reaction @entity9 pictured in two of her favourite outfits before being groomed at @entity4			1
