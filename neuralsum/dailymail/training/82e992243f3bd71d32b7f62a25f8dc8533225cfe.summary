by @entity0 she is currently a favourite to win the contest after years of failed attempts to bring @entity4 back to the @entity5			1
but prime minister @entity6 has admitted he has no idea who @entity8 is			1
it is hardly a promising sign for the 27 - year - old - whose own music teacher even says she wo n't win tomorrow 's contest			1
however , @entity6 froze when asked if he knew who was representing the nation			0
' the awful thing is , you 've got me there , i do n't , ' he admitted in an interview with @entity29			1
he added : ' is @entity30 still doing it ? he was great , was n't he ? he still is great			2
' former host sir @entity30 gave up the job in 2008 and was replaced by @entity33			0
asked whether he would be joining millions of tv viewers in watching @entity4 tomorrow , mr @entity6 said : ' probably not , if i 'm absolutely honest			2
' @entity6 confessed he will not be watching tomorrow night 's contest , held in @entity19 , @entity37 @entity8 , singing @entity38 , is going into the contest with the best odds for years doubts : despite strong support for @entity8 in her hometown of @entity46 ( right ) and a good reception from @entity48 , her singing teacher @entity43 ( left ) said she would be ' lucky ' to finish inside the top 10 the @entity5 is hoping to improve its fortunes after two woeful years when veteran acts @entity51 and @entity52 were chosen and languished towards the bottom end of the voting table			1
unfortunately , @entity8 's singing teacher at @entity56 in @entity57 is not so confident			1
@entity43 , 54 , said : ' i do n’t think @entity8 will win unfortunately because i think the competition is too political			1
' i think whoever sang for the @entity5 would not stand a chance of winning but i certainly hope to be proved wrong with @entity8			1
@entity62 ( 11/4 ) 2			0

@entity64 ( 7/2 ) 4			0
@entity65 ( 5/1 ) 5			0
@entity5 ( 9/1 ) 6			1

@entity67 ( 14/1 ) 8			0
@entity68 ( 20/1 ) 9			0
@entity37 ( 25/1 ) 10			2
@entity69 , @entity70 ( 33/1 ) ' i think if she comes in the top ten then that will be an incredible achievement and i wish her all the best of luck			2
' if i could talk to her before she goes on stage i would just tell her to be herself and enjoy herself			0
' @entity5 , like @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity62 , has won the contest five times and finished runner - up on a record 15 occasions			1
only @entity86 has won it more times , with seven successes since @entity4 started in 1956			1
in 1967 , @entity90 took the title for the @entity5 with @entity92 , followed two years later by @entity93 with @entity94			1
it took another seven years before @entity96 performed @entity97 in 1976 and brought the accolade back to the @entity5			1
in 1981 @entity99 won with @entity100			2
and the last time @entity5 was crowned winner was in 1997 with @entity102 by @entity103			1
before 1998 , the nation only finished outside the top 10 twice			1
since then , however , the entries have been branded a ' national joke ' , finishing towards the end of the table year after year			0
in 2003 , 2008 and 2010 , the acts finished last			0
worst result ever : the @entity5 has had a turbulent few years , receiving no votes at all for @entity110 in 2003 @entity52 hoped her strong @entity48 fan base would boost the @entity5 's chances but she came 19th @entity8 has had her chances of winning cut dramatically after it emerged almost no radio station around @entity48 is playing her song every year , we write off our eurovision song contest entrant as a no - hoper			1
but this time round , it seems we have even less of a chance than usual			0
@entity8 has had her chances of winning cut dramatically after it emerged almost no radio station around @entity48 is playing her song			1
the 27 - year - old , who will take to the stage in @entity19 tonight with her ballad @entity38 , is suffering from a media blackout in all of the key voting blocs , figures reveal			1
it has not been played once in the past month in @entity64 , @entity133 , @entity80 , @entity66 , @entity134 , @entity69 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 , according to the @entity5 ’s official airplay compiler @entity138			1
in others , such as @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145 , it has been played only a handful of times			2
in @entity5 the track has been played 2,346 times in the past 28 days , though most stations have played it only once or twice and it failed to make the @entity152 playlist altogether			1
and many radio listeners say they have never heard of @entity154 , who has been plucked from obscurity to represent us by the @entity29			0
last night @entity157 had her odds at 9/1 , with @entity62 ’s @entity159 the 11/4 favourite to win			1
third favourite is @entity64 , whose contestant is a bearded transvestite who performs under the name @entity165			2
miss @entity165 , the alter - ego of 25 - year - old @entity165 , has upset some of the other countries taking part , notably @entity170			0
but the singer said : ‘ it ’s just strange that a little facial hair causes that much excitement			0
’ @entity110 's rendition of @entity176 in 2003 received no points at all			0
@entity8 will be the last act to perform on the night , with @entity4 experts saying it is a good position because the song will still be fresh in the memory as voting begins			1
she landed her place in the final because the @entity5 is one of the competition ’s five big players who , along with the host nation , get an automatic place			1
however @entity86 , which has often performed well in the contest , have not been so lucky , with their entry , @entity193 , crashing out in the semi-final stages this week			1
@entity64 drag act @entity165 - the ' bearded lady ' - has got through to tomorrow ’s finale , which will be broadcast live by @entity197			2
bearded lady : @entity64 's entry @entity165 has gained a strong following in the run up to the competition @entity8 ’s effort has so far failed to resonate with music buyers at home , with the song likely to achieve number 34 in the singles chart , according to latest figures from the @entity210			2
however , even that lowly placing is better than the past two efforts , with @entity214 ’s 2013 song failing to chart and @entity51 ’s entry the year before only making it to number 60			0
@entity217 is predicting the biggest year yet for betting on the contest as it predicts more than £ 1 million will be placed in stakes			0
spokesman @entity221 said : ' we have never seen so many bets on the @entity4 - records could be broken and there is even a chance we will see a @entity5 winner			2
' veteran singer @entity51 took a stab at the elusive title in 2012 , but finished in 25th place since 1999 , the @entity5 has automatically qualified for the final , along with @entity80 , @entity70 and @entity232 , as they are the contest 's biggest financial contributors			1
however , the nation has since finished last three times			0
in 2003 , @entity237 duo @entity110 received no points for their song @entity176			0
@entity240 only received 14 points in 2008 , coming last			0
and @entity242 crashed into bottom place with @entity244 in 2010 , which only merited 10 points			0
since then , big names have tried their luck at the title , but success has eluded them			0
boy band @entity251 managed to clamber up to 11th place with i can in 2011 , scoring 100 points			0
but in 2012 , veteran singer @entity51 finished 25th with just 12 points			0
in 2013 , @entity52 did little better , finishing 19th with only 23 points			0
many claim it is not the acts but the rules - and @entity48 politics - that have led to the @entity5 's demise			2
only two @entity5 acts ( @entity264 , 2002 , and @entity265 , 2009 ) have made it into the top five since the official body ruled countries do not have to sing in their native language			1
isolated from the rest of the continent , and notoriously sceptical about the @entity274 , many feel the @entity5 has been boycotted by mainland @entity48			2
in 2008 , sir @entity30 alluded to the politics that go in to voting , saying ' it is no longer a music contest ' .			0

@entity8 , 27 , is third favourite to win the contest tomorrow
will perform @entity38 last , thought to be the best slot
prime minister admitted he did n't know who she was in an interview
singing teacher @entity43 said she will be ' lucky to finish inside top 10 '
@entity5 last won in 1997 with @entity103 , came last 3 times since
