by @entity1 reporter death : @entity3 , 69 , pictured when he was on the @entity4 before his death a hospital which put an elderly patient on a controversial end of life ' pathway ' without telling his family was criticised by a coroner yesterday			1
@entity3 , 69 , was taken to hospital after a fall down the stairs left him with a fractured neck , back and skull and bleeding on the brain			1
the pensioner , who was diagnosed with dementia in 2009 , was taken to @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22 , and then transferred to @entity23 in @entity24			1
after two weeks there doctors made the decision to place him on the @entity4 - without informing his family			1
his daughter @entity29 , 50 , said her father was then left to slowly deteriorate for a week without food , water or oxygen before he died			1
she claimed after six days on the pathway a nurse offered to reverse the programme but it was too late			1
mr @entity3 , from @entity21 , was in @entity23 's for two weeks before he was put on the @entity4 on february 17			1
his family were told his prognosis was not good and medics wanted to remove his ventilator to see how he responded			0
@entity29 said the family believed removing his ventilation would give her father the ' best chance ' of survival			0
but a day later she went to the hospital to find her father flailing about trying to breathe with ' sheer terror in his eyes ' and then discovered he had been placed on @entity4 without her permission			0
he died on february 25 without being able to say goodbye to his wife of 51 years because she was too traumatised			0
@entity29 said doctors and nurses could not explain to her why her father had been put on the @entity4 because nothing had been recorded in his notes			2
at home : @entity3 pictured hours before he fell down the stairs , leading to his stay in hospital the inquest , at @entity61 , @entity62 , heard that mr @entity3 died from bronchopneumonia , a head injury from his fall and a pulmonary thromboembolism with @entity67 's , rather than because he was on the pathway			1
coroner @entity69 said mr @entity3 , from @entity21 , had been given ' appropriate symptomatic relief ' and the hospital was not at fault over his death			2
the coroner described the decision to put mr @entity3 on the @entity4 as a ' valid clinical decision '			1
but he said the ' breakdown of liaison and engagement with his family are matters of justifiable concern			0
' and he added that ' lessons should and indeed have been learnt from mr @entity3 's death			2
' @entity84 , a lawyer who represented the @entity3 family at the inquest , said the relatives are ' considering their options ' over potential legal action against the hospital			2
inquest : the hearing was told staff at @entity23 in @entity24 , pictured , were justified in putting the 69 - year - old on the end - of - life plan but there were concerns over the fact they did not tell his family she said : ' this is an incredibly sad case of a family being denied the opportunity to be involved in end of life care decisions concerning a much loved husband , father and grandfather			1
' the coroner was clearly critical of the @entity110 for the shortcomings of their end of life care consultation process , which caused mr @entity3 's family great undue distress			1
' whilst the @entity4 has now been phased out , @entity110 and unit specific end of life care pathways are still in operation , meaning that this remains very much a real issue for patients and their families			1
' the @entity4 , designed by the @entity125 's @entity124 , aimed to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person 's life			2
doctors can withdraw fluids and drugs from patients or be put on continuous sedation if they are deemed close to death			0
phased out : the hospital used the care pathway 252 times in the first seven months of last year but the plan has been criticised by some experts and presented as a cost - cutting way to bring about the premature deaths of elderly patients			2
the government decided in july last year to end the @entity4 but in december there were reports it was simply being rebranded and not abolished			0
a @entity146 spokesman said : ' we recognise that although we did have discussions with the family we could have communicated more effectively , and we apologise to them for that			0
' we have since changed our processes in terms of next of kin communication in these difficult situations			0
' we offer our condolences to mr @entity3 's family and we appreciate that this must be a very difficult and upsetting time for them			0
' @entity160 's used the controversial pathway 252 times between january last year and july , when the government announced it would be phased out			0
since july last year it has not been used once , a hospital spokesman told @entity165 .			0

@entity3 , 69 , was treated at @entity23 in @entity24
after two weeks doctors put him on the controversial end - of - life care plan
his daughter claimed a nurse offered to reverse it after six days
it was too late and he died having been *starved* of food , water and oxygen
coroner : decision was valid but there are concerns over lack of contact
