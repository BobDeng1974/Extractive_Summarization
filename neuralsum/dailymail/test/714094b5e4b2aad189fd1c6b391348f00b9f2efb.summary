blood : the aftermath of another attack on an interpreter			0
@entity11 says they are at risk but that his concerns have been dismissed by the @entity5 government danger : despite attacks such as this , the majority of frontline interpreters who want to build new lives in the @entity5 do not qualify for the immigration scheme but like the majority of frontline translators who want to build new lives in the @entity5 , @entity11 does not qualify for an immigration scheme because of his dates of service			1
the scheme is only available to those with at least a year ’s continuous service after december 2011			2

we are not even being treated like human beings , my colleagues have to live in the shadows with their families looking over their shoulders constantly in fear of death whereas the @entity8 are being allowed to stay with all the benefits from the @entity5 taxpayer			1
it is like we are the terrorists and they are the heroes			0
’ @entity109 , who fears giving his full name , was blown up by the @entity8 in a blast that killed a @entity5 officer			1
he is now involved in a court case next month challenging the @entity5 ’s position on translators			2
a judicial review brought by @entity109 and one other @entity1 interpreter is to challenge whether the government complied with its statutory obligations towards hundreds of translators – and the attack on @entity11 and his son earlier this year will be highlighted			1
