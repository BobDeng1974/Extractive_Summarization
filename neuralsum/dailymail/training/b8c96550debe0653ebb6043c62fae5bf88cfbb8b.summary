from children working hard in the fields to a group of soldiers pushing a broken - down bus , these are the photographs that @entity7 leader , @entity6 , did n't want you to see			1
taken by photographer @entity10 during what would prove to be his final visit to the rogue state , the images reveal the shocking extent of the deprivation suffered by the people who live there			1
@entity10 , who has now been banned from @entity7 , took the pictures while in the company of state - approved guides and was asked to delete each of the images but managed to save them on his memory card			1
but if you travel there , you ’ll often see soldiers doing menial tasks ' unamused : ' the officials hate it when you take this kind of picture			0
even when i explained that poverty exists everywhere , they still forbade me from taking them ' child labour : ' when times are hard ( as they usually are here ) , children can be found working for the farming collectives , ' explains @entity10 shocking : ' @entity7 officials forbid you to photograph anyone suffering from malnutrition like this man or this little boy ' not allowed : it is forbidden to take pictures of @entity7 people if they are not well dressed			1
for my guide this man was not well dressed enough to be photographed ' scraps : ' i spotted these kids collecting maize grains in the streets near @entity59 , ' explains @entity10 of this surreptitious shot fascinatingly , not all show the poverty that the @entity7 leadership is so keen to hide			1
others offer a glimpse of the country 's bomb shelter tube stations , dilapidated buildings and draconian clothing regulation			0
others show children smiling and laughing beneath portraits of @entity6 and his father @entity72 - an act considered incredibly disrespectful by the regime			2
' every visitor is warned not to take photos without the consent of the guides as soon as they arrive in @entity80 , ' explains @entity10			1
' but in reality , it 's impossible for them to monitor everything , especially when travelling with groups			0
' they insist that you do n't take photos of anything to do with the military and anything that could suggest poverty - even when you explain to them that it exists all over the world and even in @entity96			1
' in @entity80 , as only the elite is allowed to live there , you do n't see real poverty but as soon as you get out into the countryside , it 's a completely different story			1
' unique : ' a woman standing in the middle of a crowd of soldiers			0
this picture was not supposed to be taken as officials do not allow pictures of the army ' break - down : @entity7 is touchy about images showing the military			1
' you see this all the time in @entity7 , but are n't allowed to take pictures , ' says @entity10 no photos ! ' taking pictures in the demilitarised zone ( between @entity120 ) is easy , but if you come too close to the soldiers , they stop you ' not allowed : taking photos of soldiers relaxing , such as this photograph of two men enjoying a sneaky cigarette , is not allowed in @entity7 bizarre : ' when visiting the dolphinarium in @entity80 , you are allowed to photograph the animals , but not the soldiers who make up 99 per cent of the crowd ! ' enraged : the @entity7 regime hates photos that show soldiers resting			1
' this picture really contributed to me getting banned from the country , ' says @entity10 but even in @entity80 , signs of poverty are all too apparent			1
images that reveal the extent of the regular power shortages , which the regime blames on ' @entity146 imperialists ' , and the crumbling interiors of the outwardly well - maintained apartment blocks speak clearly of deprivation			1
in the countryside , the sight of people picking grass and children working in the fields are regular occurrences			2
' the guides tell you that they [ the children ] work in the fields in the same way that teenagers here have summer jobs , ' adds @entity10			2
' the difference is that in @entity166 they are paid , while in @entity7 , it is a collective duty			2
i must say that they always seemed " happy " and did n't appear to be miserable			0
but the gap between poverty and patriotic enthusiasm is a narrow one			0
' in a bid to prevent visitors from capturing photos deemed ' unacceptable ' by the regime , state minders often attempt to confiscate the cameras owned by their charges			2
cold shower : a man bathes in the river in the countryside outside @entity80			1
' once you get into rural areas , this sort of thing is very common , ' says @entity10 fishing : ' this man was using an old tyre for a boat			1
in the countryside , people often fish in small lakes - it 's a way to get fresh food in remote areas where it 's rare ' hunger : ' my camera was confiscated for the duration of the bus trip to @entity203 which suffered in the famine			1
once i saw the people in the street , i understood why ' snooze : ' this man was taking a rest by the sea in @entity211			2
my guide asked me to delete this for fear that @entity216 media would say this man was dead			0
he was alive ' poverty : ' in @entity221 near the demilitarised zone , you are locked in an hotel complex made of old houses			0
the guides say it 's the same outside the hotel			0
no , it ’s not			0
' not impressed : ' this kind of picture is widespread in the @entity231			0
the caption often points out that @entity7 have to eat grass			1
the guides get furious if you take it ' duty : ' people go to the country to do public projects			0
the regime used to see shots like these as positive but now they know that we interpret this as forced labour ' no flash : ' as we passed by these old buildings , the guides asked me not to shoot with flash			0
the official reason was “ to avoid scaring people ” ' paranoia : ' @entity7 are very paranoid			1
i was asked to delete the picture since the guides were certain i would have said those people were homeless - they were just resting ' forbidden : the regime considers pictures showing smiles under portraits of the leadership to be disrespectful			1
' never take a picture where you can see people doing silly things in front of the @entity6 portraits , ' says @entity10 rare : ' although cars are becoming widespread in @entity80 , peasants are n't used to seeing them			1
kids play in the @entity274 just like when they did n't exist ' luxury : ' you can find all kinds of food and drink in @entity80 ’s two supermarkets			2
they even have @entity283 water but only the elite can shop there ' blackout : ' we were in @entity80 art gallery when we experienced a power outage			2
when it happens , they tell you it ’s because of the @entity146 embargo ' irritating : ' perhaps the most ridiculous prohibition of all			0
when i took the picture , everyone yelled at me			0
since the painting was unfinished , i could n’t take the picture ' scared : ' you are supposed to see fun at the @entity303 but some come from the country and are scared of escalators which they ’ve never seen before ' ' the best solution for the guides is to confiscate our cameras , ' says @entity10			2
' on the way to @entity313 , a new town opened up to tourists three years ago , they just took my cameras and put them in a bag they kept			0
they can be very smart sometimes			0
' but despite their best efforts , @entity10 did manage to take these photos and as a result , has been banned from returning to @entity7 by regime officials			1
' i was disappointed as i think i tried to show more than just the clichés you hear about this country , ' says @entity10 of his travel ban			0
' i was trying to speak to people , let them talk , show they are not robots and that they have families and a lot of culture			0
' i tried to document @entity7 in the same way i would any other country in the world , but for them to accept it , you really need to follow their rules and for me , some of those rules just were n't acceptable			0
' odd : ' officials took issue with this photo for two reasons : the teen is wearing his cap in a strange way ( according to my guide ) , and there are soldiers in the background ' multipurpose : ' @entity80 ’s subway system is the deepest in the world as it doubles as a bomb shelter			2
i was told to delete this photo because it includes the tunnel ' smarten up ! ' the way you dress is very important in @entity7			0
when i asked to take a picture of these students , the girl insisted that the man straighten his shirt ' ridiculous : ' when you visit families , the guides love it if you take photos to show that kids have computers			2
but when they see there 's no power , they ask you to delete ! ' exhausted : ' you see a lot of tired people on the roadside , since many have to ride their bikes for hours to get to work			0
taking pictures of them is forbidden			0
' eking a living : although the regime has cracked down on the black market , the ' grey market ' , to which officials turn a blind eye , allow some to scratch a living reparation : ' @entity7 says foreign aid is a war debt , but taking photos of the @entity399 sign through the window of a house in a village is forbidden ' tough : ' a rare example of an undisciplined kid in @entity7			1
the bus was driving in the small roads of @entity407 in the north , when this boy stood in the road ' patient : ' queuing is a national sport for @entity7 , ' says @entity10			1
this photo shows people waiting for a chance to catch the bus to work capital living : ' @entity80 is the showcase of @entity7 , so building exteriors are carefully maintained			1
when you look inside , the truth becomes apparent '			0

photographer @entity10 took the ' banned ' images during a visit to @entity7 earlier this year
forbidden subjects include *malnourished* people , child labourers and a man collecting grass to eat
other photos that incurred the wrath of the regime included a shot of soldiers pushing a broken - down bus
@entity10 says poverty is rare in @entity80 because only the elite live there but things are tough elsewhere
