by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:41 pm on 20th october 2011 planners who wrongly allowed a millionaire to build an enormous beach hut on @entity6 's @entity5 have been officially rebuked			1
council officials merely rubber - stamped businessman @entity9 ' application to demolish a timber chalet he had bought for £ 235,000 on the @entity11 and replace it			1
blundering staff only realised that the new hut was twice the size of the original , dwarfing its neighbours , when it was half built and residents in @entity18 , @entity19 , complained			1
' monstrosity ' : bungling council planners gave millionaire @entity9 planning permission to build a beach hut that is twice the size of its neighbours on @entity19 's @entity11 even then nothing could be done about the ' monstrosity ' because it had been given planning permission			1
now the @entity27 , dr @entity28 , has found @entity30 guilty of maladministration causing injustice			2
the council will have to write letters of apology to all those who complained about its decision			2
it must also fork out £ 3,000 on ' countryside projects ' in the area to make amends for the blunder			1
' by the book ' : @entity9 said no objections were received when he applied for planning permission but that he found the council ' shambolic ' the ombudsman said : ' the council failed to spot gross error in plans for a replacement beach chalet at @entity18			1
' its failure to recognise the true extent of the proposed development at the planning stage has resulted in a building which is incongruous in its setting on the @entity59 and within the designated area of outstanding natural beauty			2
' the principal injustice for the complainants is a wider sense of public outrage at the building now permitted in this area			2
' mr @entity9 , who owns the @entity68 which makes the @entity70 sports car , bought the 1930s chalet in 2007 and submitted plans to demolish it and build a new hut			2
the new chalet is 26ft by 24ft and is made out of oak and red cedar wood			0
it has a bedroom , bathroom , kitchen , sitting room and storage cupboard , running water and drainage			0
@entity86 , 55 , who lives in a bungalow nearby and complained about the chalet , feels the council has been let off lightly			0
he said : ' it just does not fit in and has completely destroyed the integrity of a lovely little row of chalets			0
' i have heard people visiting saying they have come to see this unusual hut - it seems as if this once desolate piece of heritage coastline is now viewed as a bit of a joke			0
' mr @entity9 said he was not surprised the council had been crticised by the ombudsman as he found them ' shambolic ' to deal with			1
dwarfing its neighbours : planners only realised @entity9 ' chalet was twice the size of the original when it was half - built , and it was already too late ' @entity110 ' : @entity111 has been officially rapped by ombudsman dr @entity28 after mr @entity9 was wrongly allowed to go ahead and build the oversized chalet he said he submitted his planning application for the chalet in good faith and it received no objections from anyone at the time			1
' when we put the application in it was all done by the book , ' he said			1
' we even called the council to see if they wanted to discuss it but they were n't interested			0
it was approved with no objections locally			0
' if people did have objections to it they should have raised them at the time			0
it was halfway through building the chalet that a guy started to complain and the council came out to measure it and they found it built to plan			0
' it has been built 100 per cent to plan , if anything it is slightly undersized			0
' we spend a lot of time down there and often pick up litter from the coastal path and the beach			0
hopefully the council can spend the £ 3,000 on cleaning the area up			1

ombudsman says officials failed to spot ' gross error ' in application
@entity111 must apologise and pay £ 3,000 for ' countryside projects '
