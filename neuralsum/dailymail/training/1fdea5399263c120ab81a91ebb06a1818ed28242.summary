sizzling : @entity1 star @entity0 was involved in a blazing drama of a different kind during the filming of @entity7 's live - action @entity5 when a wedding gown she was wearing caught fire sizzling @entity1 star @entity0 was involved in a blazing drama of a different kind during the filming of @entity7 ’s live - action @entity5 extravaganza when a sumptuous wedding gown she was wearing caught fire			1
the 24 - year - old had been shooting a scene at @entity20			1
the bridal dress — with its voluminous skirts , three miles of hemming and covered in @entity25 crystals — is a work of art in its own right			1
it covers so much square footage the actress ca n’t always see what ’s in front of her			1
she was led into her dressing room ( a large tent in a corner of the vast 007 sound stage ) and her hem brushed against a heater and began smouldering			1
‘ it had turned really cold and someone had put a three - bar heater a bit too close to where @entity0 was going to sit on a stool , ’ explained distinguished costume designer @entity40			1
‘ luckily , just a segment of the silk dress got burnt			1
thank @entity53 @entity0 was n’t harmed , ’ added @entity40 who has collected three @entity47 and two @entity48 for her screen creations			1
‘ i wore this wedding dress for about 20 seconds before i walked past the heater and burned some of it , ’ @entity0 told me as she was preparing to film sequences on another occasion with @entity57 as her dashing @entity59			1
she said she was in tears at first — until @entity64 , who plays @entity5 ’s father , lightened the mood by saying : ‘ well , i ’ll wait a while before i make the @entity69 joke			1
’ @entity0 said : ‘ i went : “ oh , no ! ” and i was laughing through my tears			1
i was n’t hurt , just a bit shocked for a little while			1
’ there are several copies of the wedding gown in varying weights for different circumstances , such as coming down a marble staircase , for dancing and walking			1
the one that was burned had a number of heavy skirts			1
‘ it ’s sort of torture , wearing this dress , ’ @entity0 explained because of having to wear a corset that cinches her down to a 21in waist			1
‘ i have no waist , ’ she said laughing			1
‘ it ’s really hard to eat			1
i have soup , and if i follow with two squares of chocolate , i ’m stuffed			2
it ’s so depressing , ’ she added , collapsing into giggles			2
‘ and because everything ’s so tight , i burp			2
you just have to burp when you need to			2
’ but , incendiary dresses aside , @entity0 said she ’s been having ‘ a ball ’ working with director @entity106 and a bevy of leading ladies , including @entity109 as her wicked - ish step - mother , @entity100 as her fairy godmother and @entity102 and @entity103 as @entity5 ’s step - sisters			2
her male co-stars include @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113			2
@entity114 and @entity115 , who are producing the film for the @entity7 corporation , said the picture wo n’t be released until @entity119			1
meanwhile , @entity0 is taking a well - earned festive break before rejoining her @entity1 ‘ family ’ in february to film the fifth series , in which she plays the vivacious @entity122			1
day job : @entity0 as @entity122 in @entity1 @entity125 believes she and @entity126 have — how can one say this — more ‘ male attributes ’ than the men in the great new movie @entity130			1
the two stars play adversaries in @entity134 ’s fictionalised picture based loosely on a real - life @entity136 scandal involving con men , the @entity139 , a fake sheik , a @entity141 and some really cool dirty dancing			2
@entity125 , who starred in the recent @entity143 ( and will soon shoot its @entity144 vs @entity143 sequel ) and @entity147 and @entity134 ’s award - winning @entity148 , plays a trickster who hooks up with a fellow fraudster , played by @entity152 ( they bond over @entity154 ) , who happens to be married to a fiery @entity126			2
@entity125 believes she and @entity126 have - how can one say this - more ' male attributes ' than the men in the great new movie @entity130 when @entity125 and @entity126 ’s characters meet , sparks fly , and they seal their loathing with a whopper of a kiss			2
@entity125 lauds @entity134 for finding two plum parts for women			2
‘ he applies what could be considered male attributes to his female characters , and they sometimes have the biggest b * * * s in his films , ’ she told me from @entity165			2
@entity125 ’s character , @entity173 , has the smartest moves , too , when she meets @entity176 ’s dandy @entity139 agent			2
in her low - cut @entity136 frock , she and @entity176 , both professionally trained , perform a fabulous dance scene that very much evokes the era			0
when @entity125 and @entity182 s characters meet , sparks fly , and they seal their loathing with a whopper of a kiss @entity125 said she ’d love to go out dancing with @entity176 off - screen , ‘ but tongues would wag ’			0
@entity173 would n’t ever worry about such things			0
‘ @entity173 has great strength , but i think she ’s lost morally , ’ @entity125 attests			0
on occasion , she took @entity173 home			0
‘ i certainly wore low - cut shirts all around the house , ’ she teased			0
@entity130 , which opens today , is one of the year ’s most delicious movies			0
it has multiple @entity197 nominations and is expected to do well when @entity48 and @entity47 lists are announced early in january			0
@entity199 will lead a rare production of @entity202 ¿ s 1958 play variation on a theme @entity199 , who will lead a rare production of @entity202 ’s 1958 play variation on a theme , which has n’t been seen in @entity207 for more than 50 years			0
it ’s about a high - society hostess , a ballet dancer and a choreographer who become embroiled in a spiteful love triangle			0
the play arrived at the same time as the theatre of the @entity215 — led by @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 — was hitting the @entity219 and elsewhere , and critics found @entity202 ’s work rather tame by comparison			0
but several recent @entity202 revivals have proved that his work remains powerfully potent			0
@entity199 ( pictured below left ) — the daughter of actress @entity226 — took part in a staged reading of variation on a theme during the @entity231 at the @entity232 two years ago			1
now the @entity234 production company is bringing the play — with @entity199 as the @entity236 — to the @entity237 in @entity207 ’s @entity238 from february 25			1
‘ it did n’t receive a favourable reception initially , ’ said @entity239 , a member of the production team			0
‘ but it ’s a bit of a lost treasure			0
’ the original production , starring @entity246 and @entity247 , was directed by sir @entity248			0
@entity249 stars with @entity250 in @entity252 ¿ s new movie her , which opens here on february 14 @entity249 stars with @entity250 in @entity252 ’s new movie her , which opens here on february 14			1
it ’s the perfect date film			1
however , you wo n’t see @entity249 ( pictured right )			0
you hear her , though , and her vocal performance is breathtaking			0
@entity249 ’s is the voice at the other end of a personal dating system that @entity263 ’s character joins			0
he becomes obsessed with her			0
members of the @entity48 have voted @entity249 onto a long list for the forthcoming @entity48			0
@entity267 , @entity48 ’s chief executive , told me that @entity249 is eligible , despite not appearing in the movie : ‘ why not ? she gives a performance			0
’ nominations are announced on january 8			0
if @entity249 ’s name prevails , perhaps her first stop , in the flesh , will be @entity48 ’s @entity276 at the @entity277 in @entity278 next month			0
i ’d be happy to pour her a cuppa .			0
