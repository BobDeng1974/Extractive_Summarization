by @entity0 they are an incredible view of lightning as you 've never seen it before - from space			2
taken by astronauts aboard the international space station as it orbited the @entity10 , they reveal lightning strikes lighting up the sky			1
researchers are now using instruments aboard the space station to try and find out more about lightning and its effects			1
the photograph above , snapped by an astronaut aboard the @entity20 on december 12 , 2013 , shows a white flash of lightning amidst the yellow city lights of @entity23 and @entity24			1
across the atmosphere of @entity10 , lightning flashes about 50 times per second , 4.3 million times a day and roughly 1.5 billion times a year			1
the @entity30 instrument includes photometers to measure lightning flashes , radio antennas to measure the static ( a proxy for the strength of the electrical discharge ) , and a gamma - ray electron detector			1
firestation is observing about 50 lightning strokes per day and looking for brief bursts of gamma rays that are emitted by some of them			2
using a new instrument on the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) , scientists are trying to observe and dissect lightning bolts every day			2
installed on the @entity20 in august 2013 , the @entity30 instrument includes photometers to measure lightning flashes , radio antennas to measure the static ( a proxy for the strength of the electrical discharge ) , and a gamma - ray electron detector			1
firestation is observing about 50 lightning strokes per day and looking for brief bursts of gamma rays that are emitted by some of them			0
gamma radiation is usually associated with exploding stars or nuclear fusion , but scientists have found evidence that terrestrial gamma - ray flashes ( @entity60 ) may occur in the atmosphere as often as 500 times a day			2
atmospheric scientists are interested in the processes that trigger lightning within thunderstorms and what kinds of lightning produce gamma rays			0
tgfs may also be related to the atmospheric phenomena known as red sprites , electrical discharges that extend upward from thunderstorms			0
' the fact that @entity76 exist at all is amazing , ” said @entity77 , the principal investigator for @entity30 and a space physicist at @entity80 ’s @entity79			0
' the electron and gamma - ray energies in @entity83 are usually the domain of nuclear explosions , solar flares , and supernovas			0
what a surprise to find them shooting out of the cold upper atmosphere of our own planet			0
' an astronaut orbiting over @entity95 on the @entity20 captured a close - up of a lightning flash beneath a thunderhead on january 9 , 2011 in a few years , @entity80 scientists plan to add another lightning sensor to the @entity20 the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) was originally designed for the @entity102 , which was launched in 1997 and is still flying			2
at the time , the research team from @entity80 ’s @entity104 built a backup @entity101 in case of trouble with the main instrument			0
that spare is still functional and is scheduled to be sent up to the space station in 2016			1
@entity101 detects cloud - to - cloud and cloud - to - ground lightning , and it can detect discharges both in daylight and at night			0
it measures the rate and amount of radiant energy in global lightning strikes			0
because the space station flies farther north and south than @entity102 , this second @entity101 instrument will extend lightning measurements beyond the tropics .			1
