fashion stores like @entity1 and @entity2 have been unable to shift winter coats and boots because of an @entity5 that has stretched into october			2
@entity1 is expected to report worse than expected clothing and footwear sales next month after it was caught out by one of the warmest autumns in a century			2
the pattern follows similar warnings issued by @entity2 and the @entity12 , which is an online retailer , while both @entity13 and @entity14 said the warmer weather has had an impact on sales			1
@entity18 , lead analyst at @entity19 , a retail consultancy , said fashion giants have lost out because they failed to have sufficient stocks of t - shirts and warm weather dresses to match the hotter than expected temperatures			1
the problem this year is that many retailers began putting winter coats and knitwear in their windows and on their shelves in september at a time when much of the country was bathed in sunshine			1
miss @entity18 said : ‘ we 've known an indian summer was coming since june , yet the high - street retailers did not react quickly enough			1
‘ the retailers need to think about pre-empting this weather with transitional stock to carry them through until the consumer wants that heavier garment			2
’ september was among the warmest @entity50 has seen over the last 100 years and the temperature gauge in central @entity52 hit an average of @entity54 , which was higher than august			0
it was the warmest september since 2006 and also the driest since records began in 1910 , which hit sales of wet weather gear , such as macs , trench coats and boots			1
the warm weather continued into early october , forcing retailers , including @entity1 , to make significant price cuts on autumn and winter ranges			1
current deals at @entity1 include a 58per cent price cut on the @entity69 with @entity70 , which is down to £ 35.99 , and a @entity71 with @entity70 , which is half price at £ 42.99			0
among the savings on woollens , is the @entity75 with @entity76 , which is down almost 60per cent to £ 52.99			0
@entity1 is expected to report worse than expected clothing and footwear sales next month after it was caught out by one of the warmest autumns in a century ( @entity82 in @entity83 on saturday ) it was the warmest september since 2006 and also the driest since records began in 1910 , which hit sales of wet weather gear , such as macs , trench coats and boots retail analyst , @entity88 , said : ‘ trying to sell coats and warmer autumn and winter clothing to people who are in t - shirts and enjoying the sunshine has clearly been extremely challenging			1
’ analysts at stockbrokers @entity95 say they expect general merchandise sales at @entity1 in the three months to september 29 to be down by four per cent on the same period last year , which is worse than the one per cent previously expected			2
as a result , it has cut its forecast for the company ’s full - year profit by 1.5per cent to £ 650m			0
next recently warned that if the warm weather continued into october – as it has – this would inevitably have an impact on its profits			1
this would take them below the previously expected prediction of £ 775m - £ 815m			0
retailers are praying for a return to real autumn weather , however it seems that after some wind and rain across @entity119 and @entity120 in the next few days , temperatures will climb again by the weekend			0
a warm air flow from @entity123 @entity122 is expected to provide three days of balmy weather for much of @entity50 late next week			2
an autumnal mini-heatwave is set to kick off next friday and temperatures could climb to around @entity126 in much of @entity52 , the @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 and @entity130			0
highs in the @entity132 may hit @entity133 ( @entity134 ) next weekend , which is way above the @entity137 average maximum for @entity138 in october			0
the mild weather will also extend to the @entity140 where the mercury could touch @entity142 ( @entity143 ) compared to a monthly average high of just 13c in @entity145 .			0

retail giants have seen profits *damaged* by never - ending summer
@entity13 and @entity14 also said warmer weather has had an impact on sales
retail expert claims many shops failed to adapt to *unusually* warm climate
lack of t - shirts and dresses with coats and knitwear *displayed* too early
