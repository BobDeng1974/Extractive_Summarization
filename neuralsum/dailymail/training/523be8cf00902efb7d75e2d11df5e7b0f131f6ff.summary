they posted jokes suggesting @entity2 might now target his players ’ wives			2

however his private life became one of the worst - kept secrets in @entity91 legal history in 2011 after miss @entity53 gave a newspaper interview about their affair			1
the @entity94 controversially imposed a draconian gagging order barring publication of @entity2 ’s name			2
this ruling was quickly flouted by thousands on @entity50			0
