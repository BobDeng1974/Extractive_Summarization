it is one of the most iconic bridges in @entity3 and a symbol of the capital recognised throughout the world			2
but @entity7 could have been replaced by a tunnel if design proposals submitted by a @entity11 engineer had been chosen instead			1
the extraordinary picture - which was the design of @entity13 - shows the landmark river crossing replaced by a tunnel with gothic towers on either side			1
engineer @entity13 's proposals in 1876 could have seen a tunnel underneath the @entity20 instead of the iconic @entity7 it dates from when the @entity22 was inviting proposals for a river crossing in 1876			1
the oil painting of the cross-section shows the tunnel of remarkably low depth with hydraulic platforms at either end to lower horses and carts under the water			0
despite being almost inconceivable given @entity7 's now iconic status , the proposals by the member of the @entity36 were one of 50 serious submissions made to the @entity22			1
the painting is now to be auctioned by @entity41 where it is expected to fetch up to £ 4,000			1
@entity7 , pictured during the @entity43 , might never have been if a @entity11 engineer had got his way a modern makeover : the bridge was built to cope with the demand of pedestrians wanting to cross the river , and has now become a striking feature of the @entity3 skyline two piers were sunk into the river bed to support the construction and over 11,000 tons of steel provided the framework for the @entity58 and @entity59			1
when it was built , @entity7 was the largest and most sophisticated bascule bridge ever completed ( ' bascule ' comes from the @entity63 word for ' see - saw ' )			2
these bascules were operated by hydraulics , using steam to power the enormous pumping engines			0
the energy created was stored in six massive accumulators , as soon as power was required to lift @entity73 , it was always readily available			0
the accumulators fed the driving engines , which drove the bascules up and down			0
@entity77 , from @entity41 's , said : ' there were lots of schemes that were submitted to the @entity22			1
' and this was an artist ’s impression of what @entity13 planned			2
' it shows the ambition of the @entity86 who believed that anything was impossible			0
' @entity13 's proposals were possibly inspired by the creation of the first tunnel to be built beneath the @entity20 between 1825 and 1843			1
the @entity92 , connecting @entity93 and @entity94 , now forms part of the @entity97 railway network			0
@entity98 was originally the only crossing for the @entity20 , but as the size of the city bloomed more bridges were constructed			0
these had to be built to the west of @entity98 , since the area east of the bridge had become a busy port			0
but in the 19th century the east of @entity3 became so densely populated that pedestrians and vehicles were being delayed by hours , so a new bridge was planned in 1876			0
it took 8 years , 5 major contractors and 432 construction workers to build @entity7 , which is built in @entity116 granite and @entity118 stone .			2

designs by @entity11 engineer @entity13 were a serious submission and might have meant the iconic @entity7 was never built
picture dates from when the @entity22 was inviting proposals for a river crossing in 1876
@entity129 artwork could fetch up to £ 4,000 as it goes under the *hammer* at @entity41 's auction house
