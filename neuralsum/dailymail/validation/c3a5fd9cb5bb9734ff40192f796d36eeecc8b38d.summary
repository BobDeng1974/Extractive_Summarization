at a quick glance they could pass for identical twins			0
so it is no wonder retired priest @entity4 was greeted with waves and ' hello @entity8 ' greetings when he moved to @entity9 , @entity10 , 18 months ago			1
for residents quickly mistook him to be 74 - year - old @entity12 , a former head teacher who is well - known in the town			1
the pair had in fact never met up until a few days ago , leaving mr @entity4 , 69 , confused as to why people constantly confused him with mr @entity12			1
@entity4 , 69 ( right ) , was constantly mistaken for @entity12 , 74 ( left ) , when he moved to @entity9 , @entity10 , 18 months ago and had no idea why - until the pair met recently and realised they are almost identical mr @entity4 , a former priest ( right ) , was greeted with waves and ' hello @entity8 ' greetings as he went about his business in the @entity10 town			1
he had no idea why until realising people thought he was ex-teacher mr @entity12 the pair ( above ) met by chance during a coach trip to @entity29 earlier this month and have now met up several times			1
they have even introduced their wives to one another and claim to have formed quite a friendship however , upon meeting , the pair quickly realised why others had mistaken them for one another – since they look almost identical			2
the pair , who are both grandfathers - of - four , also realised that despite being doppelgangers , they also had an awful lot in common - having both attended the same college , both becoming @entity47 teachers and enjoying singing in choirs			1
they also both enjoy singing , writing poetry and have a keen interest in amateur dramatics			0
and now they live just 150 yards from each other			0
mr @entity4 , who worked as an re teacher before becoming the rector of @entity58 in @entity59 in 1982 , said he was originally left stunned when he moved to the small town in september 2013 and everyone appeared to recgonise him			1
he said : ' @entity63 strangers were coming up to me and saying hello			0
' on one occasion , in the @entity66 , someone actually came up to my table and said : " you are @entity12 , are n't you ? " ' the manager was quite sure i was @entity8			1
a couple of weeks ago , i asked if i could have a word with him after he greeted me with the words , " @entity8 "			2
he would n't believe that i was n't @entity8			2
i had to show him my driving licence			0
' it made me very interested to meet this man , who i thought must be rather good - looking ! ' the pair finally came face - to - face last week when they coincidentally both boarded the same coach for a @entity82 visit to the @entity84 exhibition at the @entity85			2
mr @entity12 said : ' i did n't instantly notice our resemblance but as i boarded the bus , @entity4 greeted me with " are you @entity12 ? " @entity4 married his wife in 1968 ( left ) while mr @entity12 also married wife @entity91 in the sixties ( right ) since meeting , mr @entity4 ( left ) and mr @entity12 ( right ) have realised they have an awful lot in common and have had a similar life			1
they both went to the same college in @entity99 and both trained to be re teachers ' i was distracted with the thought : " oh dear , it 's someone else who wants me to do something			0
" ' my wife , however , did a double - take and we began to look forward to the opportunity to meet at the end of our journey			0
' it was quite spooky the day we met			0
' mr @entity12 , who has two children - @entity113 , 50 , and @entity8 , 48 - as well as four grandchildren - @entity115 , 25 , @entity116 , 23 , @entity117 , 21 , and @entity118 , 21 , said he just ' could n't believe it ' when mr @entity4 explained it all to him			1
he said : ' i 've really been struck by all the coincidences as we do have so much in common - yet we have never met before			2
' my only worry is the number of people who probably think i 've been ignoring them when they 've been saying ' @entity125 ' to @entity4 all this time			1
' mr @entity4 said they ' hit it off immediately '			2
he added , jokingly : ' we 're thinking of a life of crime			0
' if one of us stays at home and the other robs a bank then we will always have an alibi			0
' asked if she could tell them apart , mr @entity4 ’s wife @entity135 , 70 , said : ' i certainly can - after 47 years together you do n't make that mistake			1
' people have asked if me and @entity91 look alike - i do n't think we do but i guess we must share a similar taste in men			1
' i just think it is lovely that they have met like this			0
' as well as looking alike , the two men have lived very similar lives			2
they both studied at the @entity147 in @entity99 in the sixties , but never met			0
mr @entity12 ( pictured with his wife @entity91 and granddaughters ) had no idea mr @entity4 was getting mistaken for him in their hometown until he bumped into his look - a - like during a coach trip to @entity29 mr @entity4 ( pictured left aged three , and right as a schoolboy ) said the pair have become good friends			1
he said : ' we realised that we agreed on almost everything , from politics , to our theological views on the church ' and they both went on to become @entity47 teachers , with mr @entity12 teaching at @entity9 's @entity167 and @entity168 schools , before becoming head of silver end primary school , while mr @entity4 became a priest			1
the pair also both married their sweethearts in the sixties , soon after meeting them , and they both enjoy singing in choirs			0
when they met for lunch last week , they realised they even had accounts with the same bank			2
mr @entity4 said : ' there was an astounding moment when we put our cards on the desk to pay and we could almost have said " snap " ! ' when we finally met we immediately felt comfortable with each other and found we had so much in common			1
' other people say we 're like twins			0
i can see the likenesses , but he 's slightly taller , and i 'm slightly fatter			0
' ' we had lunch together on friday and realised that we agreed on almost everything , from politics , to our theological views on the church , education and what we think about mr @entity200 , and the fact that we both write poetry			0
' the men are now firm friends and have enjoyed several lunches together , introducing their wives to one another .			0
