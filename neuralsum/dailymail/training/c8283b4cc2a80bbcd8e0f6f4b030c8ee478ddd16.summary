his brother @entity16 joined the celebration but @entity0 's pregnant sister - in - law , the @entity18 , who has been suffering from severe ante - natal sickness , had to stay away			1
the birthday boy drove himself in through the rear entrance to the house at 7.20pm with his protection officer by his side in the top - of - the - range @entity51			0
but it was unlikely , given @entity0 ’s fondness for a good time , that he would be driving himself home to @entity55 again			2
his brother , prince @entity16 , arrived shortly afterwards , also driving himself in a brand new range rover			2
most of @entity0 ’s guests drove up through the gates in their car , pressing a printed invitation with a cypher on the top up against the window to a waiting police office for identification			0

@entity103 ’ rumours that @entity0 was having a ski resort - themed party at @entity55 organised by @entity18 and her former party - planner sister , @entity107 , at the weekend appear to have been wide of the mark			1
but the party was still a well - deserved pat on the back for @entity0 after the phenomenal success of the @entity2 , his @entity113 - style competition for injured servicemen which could be rolled out worldwide			2
the birthday party came amid rumours that @entity0 's romance with ex-girlfriend @entity118 is back on			0
