by @entity0 @entity1 will throw down the gauntlet to @entity3 – by warning that @entity4 will only give him a better deal if he threatens to pull @entity6 out of the @entity7			1
in a major speech this week , the @entity9 mayor will back a report concluding that a @entity6 exit from the @entity7 would be better for the country than staying in an unreformed institution			1
the study , by the mayor ’s economic adviser , banker @entity17 , says that leaving the @entity7 is ‘ definitely a viable option ’ and comes a ‘ very close second ’ to staying in a successfully reformed @entity7			2
mayor of london @entity1 will back a report concluding that a @entity6 exit from the @entity7 would be better for the country than staying in an unreformed institution mr @entity1 is expected to say that the @entity6 should ‘ not be frightened ’ of leaving the @entity7 – a stark contrast to the position of the prime minister , who has always said he wants @entity6 to stay in			1
it comes amid growing speculation that the @entity9 mayor , and possible future @entity33 leadership challenger , will announce plans to return as an mp next year			0
mr @entity3 has pledged a referendum on @entity7 membership by 2017 , following @entity4 reforms including a crackdown on benefit tourism			1
but the mayor is understood to believe that mr @entity3 ’s strategy will not guarantee success			2
a source close to mr @entity1 told the @entity45 that he believes mr @entity3 must be ‘ bold ’ in his demands in the renegotiation of the @entity6 ’s @entity7 membership he has promised if conservatives win next year ’s general election			1
mr @entity1 is understood to believe that the best way of achieving this is by showing he has ‘ no fear ’ of departure if the talks fail to deliver			0
‘ @entity1 favours a renegotiation in which we stay in and complete the common market , ’ the source said			0
‘ he believes that is achievable by being bold about that renegotiation and not having that fear about leaving			0
if voters say that ’s not enough and we leave , the longer - term aspects of that are not as damaging as people might imagine			0
’ mr @entity1 is expected to endorse a list of eight demands for reform proposed by mr @entity17 which go beyond what the prime minister has publicly set out			1
it is believed that the @entity75 finds that @entity9 ’s gdp of £ 350billion – around a fifth of the @entity6 economy – can be expected to grow to £ 640billion by 2034 if @entity6 stays in a reformed @entity7 which allows a new orientation towards trade with growing markets in the rest of the world			1
it would still expand to £ 614billion if the @entity6 quit @entity4 to pursue its own trade - friendly policies			0
however , if @entity6 stayed in an unreformed @entity7 , @entity9 ’s gdp could be expected to grow to just £ 495billion over the same period			1
and leaving the @entity7 but failing to adopt a more outward - looking trade policy would limit it to £ 430billion			0
mr @entity3 has pledged a referendum on @entity7 membership by 2017 , following @entity4 reforms mr @entity17 said : ‘ the best economic scenario for @entity6 over the next 20 years is to be in a significantly reformed @entity7			1
‘ but if , as an alternative , the @entity6 leaves the @entity7 on good terms , while adopting sensible outward - looking trading policies , that comes a very close second			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity6 can only achieve meaningful @entity7 reform if it ’s serious about leaving			0
our detailed study shows it ’s definitely a viable option for the @entity6 to be outside the @entity7			2
’ mr @entity3 has said he hopes to be able to recommend voters opt to stay in the @entity7 in the in / out referendum he has promised for 2017 , following the planned renegotiation			1
mr @entity1 ’s expected comments are likely to increase pressure on him to make clear to @entity7 counterparts that he is ready to recommend withdrawal if the renegotiation fails to deliver the reforms he wants			2
@entity109 , of the pro-reform group business for @entity6 , said : ‘ failure to change the damaging status quo of our relationship with the @entity7 poses a huge threat to @entity6 business and in particular @entity6 ’s financial services			0
‘ the mayor is absolutely right that we should seek serious reforms of our relationship with the @entity7 , but also that we should not be afraid of the prospect of @entity6 leaving a stagnant @entity7			2
‘ as business for @entity6 research has shown , the @entity124 faces huge and growing threats from the eurozone			0
we need a robust strategy to bring back powers to the @entity6 and make the @entity7 more competitive , but this will only be possible if @entity6 is serious about leaving if the @entity7 fails to reform			0

mayor of @entity9 will give a major speech this week advising mr @entity3
will say @entity6 exit from @entity7 is better option than an unreformed institution
@entity1 is expected to tell the prime minister not to be ' frightened of exit '
@entity3 wants @entity6 to stay in and pledged @entity7 referendum by 2017
