' registering and holding a			0
xxx domain name identical to [ sir @entity2 ’s ] mark without having any rights or interests therein is evidence of bad faith registration and use , ' it said in its ruling , reported @entity35			1
the dispute began when brand owners were invited to block addresses based on their trademarks for a one - off fee , before			2
xxx opened for general registrations last year			2
xxx designed as a internet home for porn sites , but the @entity18 found that because mr @entity17 had no connection to the pornography industry that he ' impliedly admits in his papers that he has no rights in the domain name ' on december 10 , just four days after the			1
xxx domains were released , @entity17 picked up and registered ' richardbranson.xxx ' for a few dollars			1
