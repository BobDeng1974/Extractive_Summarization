this footage exposes the @entity2 fur farms where a distant relation to dogs are skinned alive en - masse and turned into luxury coats sold in the @entity6			1
animal rights activists smuggled secret cameras into farms and markets near @entity11 , where they spent three weeks pretending to be potential business partners from @entity13			1
there they filmed the industrial scale of fur farming , a practice banned in @entity19 14 years ago but largely unrestricted in many other countries including @entity2			1
the activists claim the animals they saw on the two farms , each holding 300 or 400 raccoon dogs , were confined to faeces - filled cages barely larger than their bodies			1
dead raccoon dogs were fed to those still alive , the activists claimed , and almost every animal showed signs of ' mental or physical illness '			1
one secretly - shot section of their footage showed multiple raccoon dogs crammed into single cages and one with a wound to its leg			1
another showed the grisly death of a raccoon dog at a sprawling open - air fur market , where it was stunned by two electrified metal rods hooked up to a truck engine 's battery			1
horror : the most chilling scene shot by the activists was the live skinning of a raccoon dog at a fur market torn limb from limb : a grinning worker stunned the animal with the current from the truck 's battery a grinning worker then demonstrated how to skin the animal to a watching crowd , ripping off its pelt around its head with half a dozen forceful tugs while its legs remained hooked to the back of a truck			1
the two activists behind the footage were part of the campaign group @entity94 based in @entity95 , @entity96			2
founder @entity97 , one of the two undercover activists who infiltrated the farms , told @entity100 the consequences could have been dire if he was caught			2
describing the farm , he said : ' there was a stench coming from the cages			0
the animals had no access to water and when they were skinned , the corpses were left lying in the open air			0
' several of them showed clear signs of psychological stress and suffered stereotypical behaviour such as pacing , biting bars and self - mutilation			0
' most of the animals were killed at the farm and skinned			0
many times the bodies were then fed to other animals			0
' the majority are killed when they are a few months old but others are kept for breeding			0
some of these animals spend four or five years in a tiny cage going round in circles going crazy			0
' aware : undercover activist @entity97 said he and his colleague , from @entity96 , could not be found out ' most of the animals were skinned at the farm , ' mr @entity97 said			0
' many times , bodies were fed to other animals ' mr @entity97 said seeing an animal skinned alive at a market was the most harrowing moment - and the most nerve - wracking for him personally			2
' he brought us into this small circle where we were the only western people , so immediately they were suspicious , ' he said			0
' but because we were with a very well - known fur trader they allowed us to be there			0
what they did n't know was that we had a hidden camera			0
' he told us he was selling all over the world , including @entity13 , and he has several customers in @entity13 and the @entity150 ' mr @entity97 added : ' they know there 's a growing outrage against the cruelty of the fur trade , so as westerners it 's difficult for us to access these places			1
they know animal activists are interested so they 're reluctant to say much to outsiders			2
' they showed us everything because we appealed to them as business people and they thought we were going to do business			0
breeds : the farm also had foxes bred for their fur , with many crammed together into one cage uncomfortable : other animals were in cages propped up on bricks , barely larger than their bodies cramped : this animal at one of the two fur farms was barely able to turn around			2
many had signs of stress ' on a couple of occasions in the market it felt dangerous			0
when we were coming back in the car with the fur farmer he asked us if we were journalists			0
' one activist ended up in a car chase when he tried to film a fur market			2
he was taken to the police station and they confiscated the tapes of what he filmed there			0
' the organisation is calling for more countries to ban or impose stricter welfare laws on fur farming , which has boomed in @entity2 amid the rise of the newly - rich			1
@entity2 is now the world 's biggest importer of fur despite already producing a quarter of the world 's pelts , according to the @entity208			1
a @entity150 report in 2010 said 30million mink , 25million foxes and 15million raccoon dogs were set to be slaughtered for fashion in @entity2 that year - up 15million on the year before			1
it added most of the country 's fur farms - most of which have been built since 1995 - were small family firms , making it harder to carry out checks on the number of animals or their welfare			2
@entity13 remains by far the biggest fur farming region , producing 60 per cent of the world 's supply			1
grisly : mr @entity97 said there was a ' stench ' at the farm as skinned carcasses were left in the open air wounds : raccoon dogs which were kept to breed could live on the farms self - mutilating for several years defeat : fur farming was banned in @entity19 in 2000 , but is widespread in @entity2 alongside @entity237 and @entity238 but activists have shone a spotlight on @entity2 because of its rapid expansion and lack of welfare laws			1
' i think it can be as bad as in other countries , but in @entity2 there are no particular laws , ' mr @entity97 said			2
' so even if you film cruelty there 's nothing you can do about it			0
' i 've also been in fur farms in @entity237 , @entity254 and @entity238 and found animals that are mutilated and cannibalising each other			2
' fur farming was banned in @entity19 in 2000 amid a public outcry , and the country 's last remaining mink farmers were paid compensation by the government			1
a year later @entity19 banned imports of dog and cat fur , in response to a two - year @entity268 campaign which tugged public heartstrings with images from the film @entity271			1
raccoon dogs do not come under the legislation because the animals are so distantly related to domestic pets			1
many @entity150 websites list coats and collars made from @entity2 ' @entity280 raccoon ' , and the use of the name means buyers do not always realise they are buying the fur of canines			1
mr @entity97 's colleague @entity286 said : ' these furs are shipped to countries across the globe			0
they line coats at stores throughout the @entity150 ' the chief executive of the industry 's @entity293 , former @entity296 mp @entity295 , said skinning alive was ' completely unacceptable and impractical '			0
' i know of no one in the fur business who would do that , ' he said			0
' i promise that if anybody has real and factual evidence with names and locations [ ... ] i will bring that to the attention of the relevant authorities so that they can prosecute those involved			0
' a statement by two of the @entity293 's leading @entity2 members - who were not implicated in the farms shown in these images - also said skinning alive was ' abhorrent ' .			1
