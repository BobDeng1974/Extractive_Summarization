by @entity0 parents of a young girl were stunned when they were told by hospital staff their daughter would have to get the train home after having brain surgery			1
@entity8 , 50 , and husband @entity9 , said there was no way their 13 - year - old daughter @entity12 was well enough to travel on the train minutes claiming she had only come out of surgery minutes before			1
@entity12 from @entity17 , @entity16 suffers from a brain tumour , has had several operations at @entity20 , @entity21 in the past and the hospital has always provided transport home			1
@entity8 ( left ) and husband @entity9 ( right ) were outraged when their 13 - year - old daughter @entity12 , who suffers from a brain tumor , was told to take the train home after a surgery on thursday march 27 she was taken by hospital transport to @entity31 for another operation scheduled that day			1
a delay caused the procedure to be pushed back to saturday march 29 , and afterwards the surgeon told her she was well enough to go home			2
but instead of organising transport , which had been provided for her before , they told her the train was the best option			1
@entity12 's brain tumor told has caused her to have several surgeries in the past mother @entity8 , 50 , who was at the hospital , said : ' i was just sat by the bed when i presume a sister dressed in dark blue came into the ward and said , " is there anything i can do for you ? " ' i said we 'd come up in ambulance transport and we 'd be needing some transport back to @entity17			1
' straight away she said , " no we do n't do transport back			2
" ' i said " but we went up in the ambulance so how were we expected to get back ? " ' she said that there was always the train			0
' i was horrified when she said it - i thought she was joking			0
' bearing in mind @entity12 had just had surgery and the main rail line at @entity66 was out of action at that time			1
' i explained that to her and she said , " i suppose it 's not ideal			0
" ' @entity12 was in bed listening to all this			0
' she 's been hospital lots and lots of times and she heard that she had to go home on the train - i just think it 's not on			2
' @entity12 's father mr @entity78 added they always had transport provided previously when she 'd been in for surgery			2
he said : ' last time she went in the hospital provided a taxi			0
the time before that it was a hospital transport			0
and the time before that was hospital transport too			0
@entity20 in @entity21 , has always provided transport in the past after @entity12 has had a surgery ' i mean she can hardly move her head after surgery			2
it 's not fair - there 's no compassion			0
' @entity9 who has sight problems and could n't drive them home managed to arrange a taxi for @entity12 and @entity8 at a cost of over Â £ 100			2
the hospital said they were looking into the incident but say that because it was the weekend providing transport may have been more difficult			0
@entity20 claims that because the surgery took place on the weekend , they could n't provide transport			1
they did offer to provide reimbursement for costs to travel home mrs @entity113 said : ' i do n't think that 's @entity116 was diagnosed when she two			1
' we 've done lots and lots with her - i just feel let down			0
' a spokesman for @entity31 said they were disappointed the family was unhappy , but that it was n't possible to organise transport because it was the weekend			1
they also said they 'd offered to sort it out on the monday and reimburse them the cost of the taxi fare .			0
