by @entity0 up in the back bedroom of a three - storey terrace house in a @entity5 town , a young couple have been busy making the most of the good weather to boost their online business			1
where a bed and wardrobe should be , there are now filing cabinets filled with packs of pills and phials of liquid			1
on a nearby desk sit two computers and a stack of padded envelopes ready to deal with the flood of incoming orders			2
exactly how much money this internet ‘ pharmacy ’ was turning over each week will no doubt emerge in time			2
but last week , when i accompanied a team of investigators from the medicines watchdog on an early - morning raid , more than £ 50,000 - worth of illegal drugs were crammed into this one room alone			1
slimming pills : their main market is women desperate to find a quick - fix way of shedding the pounds ahead of their summer holidays it became apparent who these banned medicines were targeted at as the team sifted through their haul — packet after packet of multi-coloured capsules in boxes branded with the image of a trim , young woman showing off her toned body in a crop - top and shorts			1
they are slimming pills and their main market at this time of year are women desperate to find a quick - fix way of shedding the pounds ahead of the summer holiday season			1
the trouble is that what is on offer here is banned in this country because the ingredients , manufactured in unregulated laboratories in @entity68 and @entity69 , could cause serious illness or death			2
‘ in the spring , women will go online and buy a couple of months ’ worth of tablets which they think will help them fit into their bikini , ’ explains @entity72 , head of enforcement operations at the @entity74 ( @entity75 )			1
‘ but buy from websites like these and you do n’t know what you are getting — these pills can cause strokes and heart attacks			1
‘ you also have no idea where this stuff is being manufactured or stored , and you can not guarantee how much active ingredient each pill contains			0
in the past , we have raided places where different chemicals were being mixed up in cement mixers , with the stuff on the floor being swept up and shovelled back in			0
they just do n’t care			0
’ and make no mistake , the sale of illegal diet pills and other banned medicines over the internet is big business			1
what is on offer here is banned in this country because the ingredients , manufactured in unregulated laboratories in @entity68 and @entity69 , could cause serious illness or death in the @entity113 over the course of the past few days , the @entity75 and @entity111 have seized some 3.6 million doses of medicine worth £ 9.5 million as part of a crackdown on the illegal internet trade in harmful counterfeit , unlicensed and adulterated medicines			0
they have also shut down almost 2,000 websites and removed nearly 20,000 links to these sites that were supported by social media platforms such as @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			0
the nationwide haul included steroids , numerous types of erectile dysfunction products and a wide variety of slimming pills			1
the vast majority are bought in bulk from abroad , imported into @entity113 and sold on via the internet			0
in the raid i witnessed , the drugs had first been shipped to a mail - forwarding address in @entity143 and then on to the couple , both of whom are @entity145 immigrants , in @entity146			1
and it was from there that the pills were then sold via their website			1
two of the products on offer — @entity153 15 and @entity154 — contain sibutramine , a weight - loss drug previously available on prescription as @entity158			1
but in october 2010 it was withdrawn from the market and is now a controlled substance			1
action was taken after some of those taking sibutramine reported adverse health effects , including raised blood pressure and pulse rate			0
there were also concerns it could pose a significant risk in patients with a history of coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure , arrhythmias or strokes			0
@entity176 , 28 , was prescribed slimming pills twice and had extreme reactions before it was banned in @entity113 , @entity176 , 28 , was among those to be prescribed the drug — and experienced first - hand its worrying side - effects			1
@entity176 , of @entity184 , @entity185 , first tried it as a teenager after her weight climbed to 13st			1
despite trying conventional diets and joining weight watchers and @entity192 , she could not shift the pounds			0
her doctor suggested she try @entity158			0
the pills work as an appetite suppressant , and over the course of the two months that @entity176 was taking the drug she lost a stone			1
but all the time she was battling against deeply unpleasant side - effects			1
‘ for the first couple of weeks it was n’t too bad — a racing heart as if i had drunk far too much coffee , ’ says @entity176 , who is now married and works in digital marketing			1
‘ but then i started not to be able to sleep and would be up all night			0
that was followed by really excruciating stomach ache and pains in my chest which in the end got so bad i decided to stop taking the pills			1
’ despite that experience , @entity176 was once again prescribed the pills shortly before they were banned in 2010			1
this time she requested a lower dosage — but even so she suffered as before			0
‘ i started having heart palpitations and once again could n’t get to sleep , ’ she says			0
‘ i could n’t concentrate and started to feel terribly light - headed			1
the reaction was still quite extreme			0
’ after a month , she binned the remaining tablets and was not at all surprised subsequently to learn that @entity158 had been withdrawn from sale in the @entity113 and many other countries around the world			0
she was lucky the health problems she suffered were only temporary			0
two years ago , an 18 - year - old girl from @entity223 who bought slimming pills online containing sibutramine ended up fighting for her life			1
after just five days taking the pills , the teenager developed ischaemic colitis , a severe swelling of blood vessels supplying the intestines			2
it rarely occurs in young women and resulted in her having her colon surgically removed			2
the girl , who was not named , was not overweight			2
she told doctors she had bought the drugs to ‘ tone up ’ for a holiday			0
it is not just pills containing sibutramine that are causing concern			2
the @entity75 is seeing increasing online sales of ‘ herbal ’ and traditional @entity68 slimming medicines			0
some of these concoctions contain dangerous levels of heavy metals such as mercury , arsenic and lead			0
after just five days taking the pills , the teenager developed ischaemic colitis , a severe swelling of blood vessels supplying the intestines the herbal medicines often contain some sort of active ingredient which is not disclosed on the labelling			2
this month the @entity75 has issued warnings about three products found to contain undeclared prescription - only ingredients			2
a recent batch , aimed at women , was found to contain sildenafil , the active ingredient of @entity269			2
these pills wo n’t help with slimming but will give a reaction , such as facial flushing , which dupe the consumer into thinking they are working			2
other herbal medicines have been found to contain substances such as the plant extract ephedra , which is classed as a prescription - only medicine in the @entity113 because of the serious side - effects it can cause			2
these include insomnia , psychosis and heart palpitations leading to serious cardiac complications			2
of course , the added risk when buying online is that it is impossible to know how strong the pills are , what they contain and how the individual will react to them			2
it is something 31 - year - old dance teacher @entity294 , from the @entity295 , learned to her cost when she bought slimming pills from @entity298			1
although she was a size 12 and weighed 10st , she was keen to lose weight around her stomach			2
@entity294 , 31 , who experienced psychotic episodes after taking a course of slimming pills that she bought online ‘ i paid £ 90 for three months ’ supply , ’ she says			1
‘ it was a lot of money but i thought it would be well worth it			0
when they arrived in the post i could n’t wait to get started			0
’ but shortly after beginning the course , @entity294 began to notice a change in how she felt			1
‘ i was full of excess energy , ’ she says			0
‘ i began to feel constantly agitated , too , i kept snapping at my family and i could n’t sleep			0
’ stranger behaviour also began to manifest itself			0
@entity294 started to experience feelings of paranoia			1
convinced she was being spied upon , she suffered a breakdown			0
‘ at the hospital i totally freaked out , ’ she says			0
‘ i was screaming and running around the wards where patients were sleeping			0
’ hospital security were called and wrestled her to the ground			0
the police were summoned and @entity294 was sectioned to a psychiatric ward where she was given sleeping pills and mood stabilisers			1
i had done humiliating things and put my family through hell — all because i had wanted to be thin			0
i ’d developed paranoid psychosis just so i could get a flat stomach @entity294 at first , doctors believed she might be bi-polar until a paramedic discovered the slimming pills — and that they contained ephedra			1
they quickly linked the drug to her behaviour			0
after two weeks , @entity294 was allowed home with daily visits from a psychiatric nurse			1
three months later the fuzzy unreality gave way to a shocking truth			0
‘ i had done humiliating things and put my family through hell — all because i had wanted to be thin , ’ she recalls			0
‘ i ’d developed paranoid psychosis just so i could get a flat stomach			1
‘ my parents were wonderfully supportive , but many of my friends dropped me or shied away			0
i was dating a man , but he did n’t contact me again after i was sectioned			2
’ in the six years since , @entity294 has made a full , if slow , recovery and got married recently			1
‘ i have n’t had any long - term psychiatric problems , ’ she said			2
‘ but it took a year to put my life back together			1
i ’m lucky — if that paramedic had n’t discovered my pills , i might still be in that unit and on heavy - duty medication for life			1
’ the fear is that given the scale of the trade in these drugs on the internet — and the lengths people are prepared to go to lose weight — others will be less fortunate .			0
