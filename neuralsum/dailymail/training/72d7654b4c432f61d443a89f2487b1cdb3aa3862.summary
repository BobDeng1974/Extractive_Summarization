by @entity0 the morning after a dismal @entity2 defeat to @entity3 , @entity4 woke early from a fitful sleep			1
‘ @entity8 ’ was the headline in one national newspaper			1
it reflected the @entity11 ’s mood perfectly			1
there was no blood on the walls			1
yet @entity17 ’s manager felt as if he had woken from a nightmare of @entity20 proportions			1
lifeline : @entity4 is determined to take advantage of @entity17 's @entity2 lifeline ‘ i felt as if i ’d killed someone when i woke up , ’ he told @entity24 yesterday			1
‘ that ’s how it is every time i lose a match			2
‘ if you do n’t hurt when you lose matches , something ’s wrong			2
that ’s the worst feeling in football , waking up the morning after a defeat			2
’ @entity17 had lost more than their reputation as an established @entity2 club in the course of a 6 - 1 aggregate defeat to the @entity40 champions			1
they had also lost a vital source of revenue			2
@entity17 ’s plc board do n’t budget for reaching @entity45 ’s group stages			1
they would have coped with going out			2
but the huge , unexpected stroke of luck offered by a @entity3 registration error has resurrected the prospect of a £ 15million windfall for the @entity53 club			1
for @entity4 , it ’s the difference between finally signing a player of pedigree or bringing in more jersey fillers			1
in the aftermath of the @entity60 debacle — that second - leg 2 - 0 defeat — he spoke of rebuilding his team from scratch			1
he has since backtracked , realising perhaps that he does n’t have that luxury			2
instead he has to get the best from what he has			2
telling the existing squad they were finished was the mistake of a man running on empty			2
a new coach at a new club , in a new city , in a new country , @entity4 felt exhausted and probably a little overwhelmed @entity75			1
there was an admission yesterday that he may not have been fully on top of his brief			2
preparation : the squad are in @entity82 preparing for the first leg of their play - off against @entity85 ‘ it was a very difficult position to be in , ’ he said			1
‘ i had only been at the club for four weeks and we had been pushed into it			2
but you learn quick in this job			2
i also felt tired after the game because i think i had maybe pushed myself too much			2
‘ the first day was very hard but you have to admit what level you are at			2
on that day , we were at that level and had to work from there			2
‘ i feel very different right now			0
i had done a lot of work and a lot of travelling , and i did n’t know many people			0
now i know my team , i have got my head up and i have control of the situation			0
’ the first he heard of what proved to be an incredible @entity2 lifeline was when a journalist called him later that night			1
@entity3 tried everything to overturn @entity45 ’s decision to award @entity17 a 3 - 0 second - leg win after @entity113 played the final minutes of that match while suspended			1
it was a genuine mistake , but a hugely costly one			0
it was also an enormously fortuitous break for @entity17			1
one @entity4 feels duty bound now to take advantage of against @entity85 on wednesday			1
discussion : @entity4 in talks with assistant @entity121 about their plan of action ‘ i did n’t feel anything when i was told we could be back in , ’ @entity4 said			1
‘ my focus is always on football			0
it ’s about performances , whether you get the chance or not			0
when we perform , we achieve things			0
we have got a second chance and we will do everything to take it			0
‘ i know now where we are going and i know how we are going to improve			0
now we have a chance to see how far we have improved in 14 days			0
i am confident that we are going to reach the right level as we showed on saturday			0
‘ i think we are in a good mood in the group			0
they are training good and have responded fantastically			0
everyone is doing everything they can to improve every day			0
’ against @entity3 , of course , the real damage was done away from home in @entity146 with a dire 4 - 1 loss			1
‘ yes , i made mistakes in @entity146 , ’ admitted the @entity11			0
‘ what were they ? we ’ll see			0
’ it ’s unlikely , this time , he will be as tactically gung - ho			1
square pegs occupied round holes in the @entity155 that night and the @entity17 coach is less likely to make the same selection errors this time			1
‘ the first time we went into the @entity2 i had n’t been long with the players , ’ he conceded			1
‘ i feel more comfortable with them now — i know what kind of team i have			0
i know the strengths of the players now			0
‘ also they are looking in good shape			0
they are fitter than in the last match and have adapted more			0
‘ so that puts us in a better position than we had the last time			0
’ all smiles : striker @entity172 in high spirits in training ahead of the game the @entity146 result might have been an acceptable narrow defeat but for a late collapse			0
from 2 - 1 with six minutes remaining , it finished 4 - 1 , rendering the second leg a hopeless act of futility against a better team			1
champions of @entity82 for the last four years , it is likely @entity85 will look at the videos of @entity3 and fancy their chances			1
in recent years , they have toppled @entity189 and @entity190 and have individuals with technical ability			0
but @entity4 ’s aim is to fly back to @entity194 with the tie still alive			1
‘ you have to think long term of course , ’ he admitted			0
‘ but now , in the short term , everything is about a result			0
i ’m much better now than i was and i think the players have adapted			0
’ for all the positive signs against @entity206 at the weekend , there are dangers in reading too much into domestic football			0
recent @entity210 results show that the @entity211 lacks the financial clout to compete at this level			0
@entity17 have managed to add players — and @entity215 , @entity216 and @entity217 show signs of adapting quickly			1
but @entity219 did n’t travel here , while @entity222 @entity221 was last night scrambling to clear up the red tape which would allow him to feature			0
it is also the case that injuries to @entity228 and @entity229 are a nuisance @entity4 could do without			1
buoyed by that 6 - 1 thrashing of @entity206 , however , he insisted : ‘ they showed they are at a better level than they were away to @entity3			1
small things can make a big difference and i think those small things are going more in our favour now than they were in @entity146			0
‘ we are more prepared and i have a good feeling that we can make a good performance and get a result to take home to @entity194			1

@entity17 set to face @entity85 in @entity2 play - off on wednesday
first leg set to take place in @entity82 , before return leg back in @entity194
@entity4 's side were thumped 6 - 1 on aggregate in third *qualifying* round
