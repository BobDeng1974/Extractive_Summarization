@entity0 is paralysed with an unbearable sense of guilt as he tries to make any sense of what would possess his son , now known as @entity6 , to volunteer to sacrifice his own young life for the @entity8			1
on the surface @entity9 was far from what is perceived as a stereotypical recruit for an extremist @entity14 group : a white boy from suburban @entity16 who , as the youngest of six children , had an atheist upbringing			2
however , even his father admits you did n't have to dig too deep to see that his 18 year - old son was a troubled soul and now he will live with a life of immense regret			2
the painfully shy boy had never been happier after converting to @entity14 and regularly attending mosques but his new lifestyle choice did not end there as he flew to the @entity44 in december which ultimately cost him his life in a failed suicide mission in @entity48 last week			0
his father struggled to find any words to describe his pain and overwhelming sense of guilt when he spoke to 60 minutes reporter @entity53 which airs on sunday night			0
' he is at a complete loss to try to understand any of it - he 's trying to put the picture together now on not a lot of information at all to be honest - he is learning as much as anyone else is learning in the public forum , ' @entity53 told @entity62			0
@entity26 finds it even more difficult to comprehend that his son had plans to orchestrate what would have been a deliberate act of mass murder right in his very own city where he had lived his whole life			1
@entity6 's father shared pictures and cards with the programme , showing a @entity76 cars with the words ' @entity78 ' written inside @entity6 's father admitted to 60 minutes reporter @entity53 ( pictured right ) that you did n't have to dig very far to realise that the 18 - year - old was a very troubled soul ' he can barely talk about it all he struggles for words with the fact that his son had plan b which was to commit a major act of terror in @entity36 and had begun buying the chemicals for the bombs before he disappeared out of @entity16 , ' @entity53 said			1
as the youngest of six children , @entity6 had an atheist upbringing ' that atrocity @entity26 can not understand at all - the family are desperately trying to now go back and understand who @entity6 was because he was n't the kid they thought he was and tragically all of the warning signs were there of a kid in trouble			1
' when @entity53 suggested there were clear warning signs that his son had issues , @entity26 agreed saying : ' yes they were and i 'm so sorry i did n't do anything about it			1
' ' he said he was at times very difficult emotionally - even as a little boy , ' @entity53 said			0
' he also said " i 'm sorry i wish i could have done more to understand my son and stop him " and he 's finding it very hard to grieve because he 's feeling so much guilt , ' @entity53 said			0
@entity115 leaked a photograph of 18 - year - old @entity16 @entity9 ( pictured ) in the vehicle he allegedly blew himself up in while driving it to add to @entity6 's complexities , his mother died from cancer in 2012 and was then looked after by his five older siblings as his parents had divorced years earlier			1
his father described his son as an ' extremely shy ' loner who felt alienated from his family and even expressed in one of his blogs that he felt unsafe with his siblings			1
he said he felt he should have known about the full extent of his son 's bullying			1
' i wish i could understand more of what went on , ' he told @entity136			0
but @entity26 also feels that his son was brainwashed and believes that he was a ' soft target for ' the @entity14 recruiters			2
@entity0 ( pictured , left ) in a school photo from year 10 - the year he converted to @entity14 , according to school friends , and wearing a @entity142 shirt ( pictured right ) @entity9 's father feels a deep regret that he did n't address his son 's issues when he was a child his former fellow pupils also described @entity6 as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets and spoke seriously all of time about @entity44 politics			1
although it was unusual that the child from an atheist background converted to @entity14 there was nothing to suggest that he was acting radically in his public life but online he was in active contact with @entity8 recruiters			1
@entity6 organised to get a passport and told his family he wanted to work at a charity in @entity164			0
' he went online from writing about his love of soccer and wanting to buy a dog to children allowed to join the jihad and i cant wait for my pilgrimage to @entity172 in december , ' @entity53 said			0
the last time @entity26 ever saw his son was when he asked for his birth certificate in order to get a passport and said he seemed uncharacteristically ' upbeat '			0
' he said he was articulate and clear and seemed happy and in fact in the last communications he seemed very content and he said to his dad " i feel comfort being a @entity14 and i feel comfort in @entity14 " , @entity53 said			0
' @entity26 was optimistic that his son was on a good path that after the divorce and feeling alienated he thought that his son had found some happiness and peace			2
' however , these feelings were short - lived as @entity26 had a growing concern for his son 's welfare by the last time he ever heard from @entity6 again in the form of a @entity192 message when was in the @entity44			1
footage of @entity6 being bullied at school - his former school mates described him as as a loner who walked around with his hands in his pockets the last time his father saw @entity6 he was uncharacteristically ' upbeat ' ' the message was pretty veiled other than to say that he was in the region and had some intent , ' @entity53 said			0
@entity26 was understandably panicked but could n't find a lot of places to turn to get help and was at a great loss at what to do			0
' in fact even at that point , there was still some disbelieving that maybe this was just some great romantic notion of @entity6 's and he was off some ridiculous journey , ' @entity53 said			2
' then he could n't contact him and had no further communication from him and @entity26 learned of his son 's death as it appeared in the media last week			1
' @entity26 send a warning out to all parents to be more aware about who their children are interacting with online			1
@entity26 was optimistic that his son was on a good path and had finally found happiness and peace @entity6 's father warns all parents to take note of who their children are interacting with online ' it 's going on , it 's happening , it 's real it 's not just from a @entity14 background , it 's anybody they can find , any soft target they will aim , human life means nothing to them , ' @entity26 told @entity53			1
' i could tell he was brainwashed but they are such a powerful influence			0
' his father never wants to hear again the words that his son will be forever known as - ' @entity6 ' but instead hold onto the memory of his beloved son			2
' he 's trying to preserve a little bit of who the @entity6 was that he knew and loved - the kid who loved soccer , the kid who used to run around in the backyard and play in the park with his dad ' he said that 's the @entity6 i need to remember - @entity6 i do n't even want to hear that name because i do n't even know who that person is and that 's not my son			2
