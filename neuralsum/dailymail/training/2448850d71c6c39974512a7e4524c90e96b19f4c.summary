she told @entity20 that the biggest challenge of her job is not just rendering food picture - perfect , but accomplishing that while also maintaining its authenticity to the real - life product			1
' if it 's , say , @entity26 , or a fast food chain , everything must be according to a standard , ' she explained			0
' i have to slice a tomato exactly to their specification ; i have to use their meat and their rolls and their cheese and their condiments ... it has to be representative of what the real thing is			0
' a big part of her job is attention to detail , and ms @entity2 is a perfectionist when it comes to getting the photo exactly right			0

@entity53 : she claims that she has sifted through hundreds of sesame seed buns before to find the perfect one for a hamburger shot ( pictured : a @entity26 ad by ms @entity2 ) the former sculptor , who ran a home renovation company before becoming a food stylist , says her unconventional background gave her the skills necessary to excel in the field			1
her knowledge of ceramics and sculpture , for instance , gave her ' a great sense of color and design and texture and drama ' which she was able to translate into food styling			0
much like a make - up artist , she carries a tool bag to each job , complete with brushes , q - tips and spray - cans filled with olive oil to prep her food before it gets in front of the camera			2
there are some widely - used tricks of the food styling trade - like adding water to beverages before photographing them so that light will filter through and add sparkle			0
tools of the trade : much like a make - up artist , she carries a bag of brushes , q - tips and spray - cans filled with olive oil to prep her food ( pictured : a @entity102 ad ) for the most part , however , ms @entity2 tries to avoid these somewhat deceptive tricks , using her own creative techniques instead			1
she says , for example , that a mark of a truly talented stylist in her field is being able to create a picture - perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream , which tends to melt quickly in a spotlight			1
indeed , while many stylists use mounds of @entity115 bound together with corn syrup to simulate ice cream , she sticks to the real stuff , painstakingly creating a new scoop for every single camera take			0
some of ms @entity2 's work includes commercials for @entity123 's , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 's as well as print ads for @entity128 and @entity102			0
@entity130 eye : the stylist , who has done ads for many food chains , says her knowledge of ceramics and sculpture gave her ' a great sense of color and design and texture and drama ' which she brings to food styling no faking : many stylists use mounds of @entity115 bound with corn syrup to look like ice cream , but ms @entity2 sticks to the real stuff , painstakingly creating a new scoop for every single take she 's also coming out with a book detailing her life as a food stylist , with food shots styled by her and shot by photographer @entity153			2
food styling has long been an important part of advertising and film , but the rules and regulations that stand today came about after an incident in 1970			2

professional : she is one of the most in - demand people in an industry where the best stylists get paid up to six figures annually ( pictured : a deviled egg styled by ms @entity2 ) life story : ms @entity2 is soon coming out with a book about her time as a food stylist , with photos taken by @entity153 ( pictured : a shot of baked arctic char form the book ) since then , ms @entity2 and her fellow food stylists have had to follow a strict set of advertising guidelines			1
but that does n't mean she does n't get creative when it comes to getting the right food photos when , for example , a director asked her to style meatballs so that they 'd bounce when they landed on sandwich bread , ms @entity2 was quick on her feet			2
since meatballs are too light to bounce , ' i cooked t [ them ] with lead weights inside them , ' she revealed .			0

in 1970 , food advertising rules were *tightened* after an investigation found that @entity163 's used glass marbles to make soups look chunkier . since then , food stylists have had to be more creative and thorough
