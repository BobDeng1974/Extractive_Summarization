labour leader @entity0 will use a speech today to set out how he plans to tackle the country 's vast deficit @entity0 's bid to restore @entity6 's battered economic credibility backfired spectacularly last night			1
he pledged that reducing the deficit would be a priority if he wins the election but independent experts warned his plans would mean ' much more borrowing and debt '			1
the @entity6 leader – who forgot to mention the deficit in his party conference speech this year and has spent the past four years attacking @entity18 cuts – refused to say how and where he would reduce spending			1
mr @entity0 claimed @entity6 would impose ' year on year ' spending cuts to reduce the deficit , saying it was his ' first pledge of the election campaign '			1
and he admitted that being seen to deal with the huge budget deficit left by the last @entity6 government was now ' an essential test of credibility ' for the party , which lags far behind the conservatives on the issue in opinion polls			1
mr @entity0 pledged to bring day - to - day government spending back into balance ' as soon as possible '			1
but he gave no date for bringing the public finances back into the black – suggesting that @entity39 's towering debts would continue to rise indefinitely under @entity6			1
and though he said @entity6 was working on plans for ' common sense spending reductions ' , he refused to spell out where the axe would fall , saying the full detail would be released only after a @entity6 victory in next may 's general election			1
experts warned that his lax rules on public finances would rack up gigantic debts for future generations			0
@entity6 would continue to borrow for capital spending on things such as transport infrastructure , which is forecast to hit £ 27billion by 2020			2
and mr @entity0 rejected mr @entity56 's target of running a £ 23billion budget surplus that year , potentially allowing him an extra £ 50billion in spending and borrowing by 2020			1
advertising firm @entity60 today tweeted this picture of the billboard using the slogan which mr @entity0 was challenged to come up with this morning when your opponents are threatening to outspend you ahead of the election , you 'd be happy with any free publicity			2
but @entity0 could not have predicted he would see his name up in neon lights in @entity70 after bungling an attempt to come up with a snappy campaign slogan			2
the @entity6 leader was asked by @entity74 , the chief executive of advertising firm @entity60 , to failed to sum up his message to voters in eight words			2
he came up with 10			0
they were : ' a country that works for you , not the privileged few			0
' but five hours later the slogan , together with a picture of mr @entity0 , was emblazoned across the world famous screens of @entity70 , witness by tourists , office workers and passing taxis			2
a spokesman for the firm said : ' we took the decision to provide the space free of charge following a humorous exchange between our chief executive @entity74 and mr @entity0 earlier in the day			2
@entity96 , deputy director of the @entity97 , said mr @entity0 and his shadow chancellor @entity98 had left themselves ' a lot of wiggle room ' to let them get away with spending cuts that were ' very shallow indeed '			1
mr @entity96 told @entity105 's @entity104 : ' you would get much , much less spending cuts potentially under a @entity6 government but you 'd have much more borrowing and therefore more government debt			1
' @entity56 warned that @entity6 's plans would mean ' economic chaos '			1
public spending as a share of the entire economy will fall to just 35.2 per cent by 2018 - 19 , according to the @entity117 's forecasts of spending cuts under the latest forecasts , the deficit will fall from £ 91billion this year to put the country in surplus by 2018 - 19 , but @entity6 has promised to only reach that point by 2020 @entity124 said the rise of parties like @entity127 was due to the failure of mainstream politicians @entity6 was part of an elite that helped ' screw up ' the economy , @entity124 admitted yesterday			1
the former business secretary said the rise of parties like @entity127 in the @entity135 was partly due to the failure of mainstream politicians and institutions to prevent the financial crash			0
he suggested the last @entity6 government , in which he played a leading role , was among those that had failed on the issue			0
speaking to the @entity145 in @entity146 yesterday , @entity124 said : ' so many voters have turned outwards from the mainstream because they think those of us in the mainstream have screwed it up – and arguably we did			0
' the financial crisis , and the crisis in the banks and sovereign debt – they were man - made			0
' i 'm not saying it was made in @entity160 , but the fact is we did n't have enough strength in our systems and structures to enable us to deal with the impact of the crisis			0
' so we did screw up – the whole political , business and financial elite of the western world – and you ca n't blame people for saying so			0
' in a separate interview with @entity173 , @entity124 suggested @entity39 was heading for another hung parliament after next year 's election			0
he said a @entity18 majority appeared impossible , but suggested an outright win for @entity6 under @entity0 ' also looks less likely '			1
the chancellor said mr @entity0 and his party ' created the deficit and by delaying paying off the deficit what he 's really telling the @entity39 people is that he would borrow more and put up taxes '			1
mr @entity0 claimed the @entity18 were proposing ' extreme ' cuts			2
he pointed to official forecasts suggesting that , under @entity18 plans , the size of the state will shrink to its lowest level since the mid- 1930s			1
but mr @entity96 said the comparison was misleading			0
' the size of the government as measured as a share of national income would indeed be back to the level last seen in the late 1930s , ' he said			0
' but that is not to say that living standards would be anything like they were in the 1930s			0
our gdp is substantially higher than that , and therefore the amount we have to spend on our private consumption , on our public services in real terms is significantly higher			0
' mr @entity0 said @entity6 had already spelled out some modest cuts , such as ending the winter fuel allowance for better - off pensioners , as well as proposing new taxes , such as a mansion tax on homes worth more than £ 2million			1
@entity6 announced yesterday that it would also save more than £ 500million a year from local government budgets by cutting bureaucracy , scrapping a @entity217 scheme to boost house building and considering mergers of fire and rescue services			1
but the savings identified so far pale in comparison with @entity39 's £ 91billion annual deficit			0
the @entity6 leader also claimed that @entity39 's ' cost of living crisis ' was holding back the recovery – just as official figures showed that @entity39 's standard of living has risen to be the fourth highest in the @entity230			2
the @entity232 figures suggest the @entity39 has overtaken the @entity233 and is well ahead of @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 , with a standard of living 15 per cent above the @entity230 average			0
only @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 are ahead of the @entity39			0
n mr @entity0 came unstuck yesterday when an advertising executive asked him to devise a short election slogan			2
told it should be no more than eight words – and despite counting on his fingers – he came up with the effort ' a country that works for you , not the privileged few ' – a ten - word slogan .			0

@entity0 admits years of cuts needed to deal with the nation 's deficit
but he claims @entity257 ' approach would lead to ' *disintegration* ' of services
promises ' *commonsense* ' spending cuts if @entity6 win the election
three months after disastrous conference speech when he forgot deficit
he attacks @entity217 over plans to shrink state to level seen in 1930s
@entity275 poll finds a third of voters support *drastic* public spending cuts
@entity98 writes to all of shadow *cabinet* warning them there is no money
