it was around the time of her planned departure on june 17 that she was murdered			0
today , the judge said @entity9 must have been ' astonished ' when her parents fell for his claims that their daughter was still alive			1
the judge said : ' as the months and years passed he must have come to believe he had indeed got away with murder			0
' @entity9 went on to befriend ms @entity10 's parents			1

even after both parents died mr @entity9 went on to arrange their funerals without telling relatives			0
but he did obtain a death certificate which , with all the other information he had gained , meant he went on to strip their estate of all their assets through false telephone calls and false withdrawal slips			0
