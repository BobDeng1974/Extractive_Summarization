but unlike athletes today , victorious athletes competing at the @entity7 116 years were awarded a mere silver medal			2
second place athletes were given bronze , while anyone who finished third came off even worse and went home empty - handed			1
it is believed that gold was simply considered too precious to be handing out at sporting events			0
first place : the front and back of the silver medal awarded to winners of the events at the first modern @entity7 in @entity22 in 1896 the details of the sporting awards emerged after original medals from the the first modern olympics staged in @entity22 in 1896 have been put up for auction			2
the medals were due to be given to the winners of rowing and yachting but the events were cancelled due to the rough sea in @entity34 off the @entity36 coast			2
it 's unclear which specific disciplines the medals were due to be award for , but after the cancellation they were handed to @entity42 , the doctor from the @entity44 @entity43			1
they have stayed with his family ever since and are now expected to fetch almost £ 40,000 , with the silver worth the majority of that sum			0
the bronze medal was given to athletes who finished second , while any one who finished third traipsed home empty - handed			1
today first place gets gold , second silver and third bronze the medals , which have a two inch diameter , were designed by @entity61 and on the front is a depiction of @entity64 with the globe in his right hand			1
upon the globe stands the goddess of victory , @entity69 , who is holding an olive branch in her hands			1
on the back is a representation of the @entity74 and the @entity75 and the @entity44 inscription reads : ' @entity77 , @entity22 1896			1
' the medals are to be sold at @entity80 sale in @entity80 on september 3 and are expected to attract a lot of interest @entity83 , from @entity84 ’s , said : ' at the first modern games in 1896 all the sailing and rowing events were postponed because the sea was too rough			2
the gold silver and bronze medals used for the @entity87			2
like those from 1894 , they feature an image of @entity69 , the @entity44 goddess of victory ' they were then cancelled and these are two of the medals that were never presented			1
' at those @entity7 the winner received a silver medal and the person coming second got a bronze medal			0
' after the @entity7 these two medals were given to @entity42 who was the doctor from the @entity44 @entity43			1
' they have remained in his family ever since			0
as the medals were not inscribed we do n’t know exactly which events they were for			0
' winners at the @entity7 also received an olive branch and a diploma			0
it was only in 1904 when gold medals began to be awarded for winners			0
' there are collectors and museums who would like to own a medal from the @entity121			0
