by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 17 september 2013 updated : 09:24 est , 17 september 2013 a mother - of - three told of her disgust after finding a ' brain ' in a packet of @entity6 passata sauce this week			1
horrified @entity7 , 47 , made the gruesome discovery as she prepared a family meal of chilli con carne			1
she was shocked when she poured the passata into a pan last thursday and noticed chunks of grey matter floating in the sauce			1
shocked : @entity7 pictured with the offending packet of passata sauce no laughing matter : the ' brain ' that @entity7 believes she has found in a packet of @entity6 passata after cutting the carton open , @entity7 discovered a strange round ‘ brain - like ’ object at the bottom which measured about 10cm in diameter			1
astonishingly , @entity7 , from @entity27 , claims a @entity6 ’s customer service worker laughed at her when she rang up to complain			1
@entity7 said : ‘ after pouring the tomato passata in , i noticed the consistency was not as it should be			1
‘ i also noticed the normally bright red sauce was turning a really horrible black colour			1
‘ i realised that there was something in the bottom of the carton so proceeded to cut it open with scissors and to my horror discovered something which i can only describe as strange			2
‘ i am not sure if it was animal or plant but it looks like a brain - type material			1
the @entity6 store on @entity46 in @entity27 where @entity7 bought the passata containing the disturbing substance ‘ it ’s like something out of a horror movie			1
i was so disgusted i almost threw up			0
‘ at the moment it is frozen because that is what environmental health told me to do			0
‘ i ’m waiting for them to come back to me to take it away and have it tested			0
‘ i rang @entity6 and the advisor just giggled and said it was probably just a tomato			0
‘ i have examined the object and it certainly is n’t a tomato			1
it ’s spongy and looks like a small brain			1
‘ she asked me to send them an email and a photograph of the object which i did but i have not heard back at all			2
‘ i do n’t think i will be going back there again			0
i think i shall be staying away for a while			0
‘ i just need to put my mind at rest as i am concerned a whole batch may have been contaminated			0
‘ i do n’t want compensation , i just feel that this has now become a public health issue			0
’ @entity6 said the company was investigating the incident with its supplier			0
a spokesman said : ‘ it 's categorically wrong that there was laughing from the @entity6 employee			0
it ’s a matter we take very seriously			2
the substance is currently with the @entity87 , but our initial thoughts are that it ’s something tomato - based			2
however , we will wait until the conclusion of the investigation			0
' a spokesman for @entity93 - the umbrella body for @entity87 and trading standards - said people should report any similar issues to them			2
he said : ‘ if anyone has any concerns over any foreign bodies in food , contact regulatory services and we can investigate			0
‘ we would also advise people to keep as much information as possible including the item itself , the packaging and any receipts - it will all help			2

horrified @entity7 , 47 , bought the sauce from a store in @entity27
she noticed chunks of grey matter floating around in the sauce
the ' brain - like ' object that she found measured around 10cm in diameter
ms @entity7 said that she was nearly sick when she *spotted* the object
