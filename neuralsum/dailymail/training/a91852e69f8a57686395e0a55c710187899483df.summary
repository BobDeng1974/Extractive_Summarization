the police force which led the investigation into murdered schoolgirl april @entity3 could become the first in the @entity6 to abandon monitoring cctv ' because it fails to cut crime ' , it has emerged			1
@entity10 is set to receive reduced funding for @entity7 after an independent investigation found they have had ' little success in deterring violent crime or anti-social behaviour '			1
but , it could also stop monitoring live camera footage altogether - as early as january next year - if an inquiry by the force decides it is the best course of action			1
it would leave the police force , which covers an area more than half the size of @entity25 , without any monitored @entity7 cameras			2
@entity10 will receive reduced funding for @entity7 after an independent investigation found they have had ' little success in deterring violent crime or anti-social behaviour '			1
it could also stop monitoring live footage the force 's biggest investigation was the hunt for five - year - old april , who vanished while playing outside her home in @entity37 , @entity38 , in october 2012			1
@entity7 images caught killer @entity41 's car on the night of her disappearance , ultimately leading to his arrest			1
using footage from a variety of private and public cameras , police were able to piece together a complete picture of his movements which formed a central part of the prosecution case			2
but a report ordered by @entity57 , police and crime commissioner for the force , concluded that live monitoring of @entity7 footage should stop			1
he said the removal of cameras would not result in ' significant rises ' in crime			0
@entity10 records show that for the 12 months leading up until august this year , only 1.5 per cent of case files used publicly - controlled @entity7 evidence			1
in addition , 2.2 per cent used evidence from private @entity7 systems			2
the @entity7 network in the @entity6 is one of the largest in the world - with the @entity76 and @entity77 - among the smallest local authorities in the @entity6 - having more cameras than the @entity80			2
the inquiry into @entity7 systems revealed cameras which flood town centres and housing estates do not have a significant impact on crime			1
@entity88 , which carried out the report , discovered that while cameras have a modest impact on crime levels , they are at their most effective in reducing car crime in car parks , especially when used alongside improved lighting and the introduction of security guards			0
the force 's biggest investigation was the hunt for five - year - old april , who vanished while playing outside her home in @entity37 , @entity38 , in october 2012			1
@entity7 footage led to the arrest of her killer @entity41 @entity107 ( left ) was caught on @entity7 walking his dog ( right ) and his car was captured on the night of the murder the @entity7 review came at a time when many local councils are reducing funding to police due to financial pressures			1
mr @entity57 said : ' we must spend every pound where it delivers			0
in the meantime , i 'm giving the public what they ask me for - more bobbies on the beat			0
' the crime commissioner said he will discuss the inquiry findings with chief constable @entity129 and county council leaders before agreeing to stop the @entity7 monitoring in the @entity132			1
he said : ' i look forward to our discussions to agree a solution for @entity7 that delivers value and that most of all is effective			2
' this research will be an important reference point as we develop a strategy			0
' the @entity10 - @entity141 force covers more than half of @entity25 , from @entity143 to the @entity145 border with @entity146			2
but , it is sparsely populated with only 488,000 people in the force area			0
a @entity151 report into @entity7 effectiveness , whose authors include @entity156 criminologist @entity155 , said cameras should continue to be used but have a much narrower focus , such as reducing vehicle crime			0
traditionally , cctv cameras have been funded by councils with police meeting the costs of monitoring them			0
the report found monitored cctv cameras do not deter crime or anti-social behaviour and many are unable to produce evidence acceptable in court			0
however , the inquiry confirmed they can play a crucial role in securing convictions			0
the report said : ' properly presented , relevant @entity7 evidence provides a very credible witness factor when cases were judged they allowed the context of an incident to be conveyed to the court - particularly relevant in cases of violent behaviour			0
' also , they are instrumental in challenging not guilty pleas , and often led to an early admission of guilt			0

@entity10 is set to receive reduced funding for @entity7 next year
inquiry to be held over *scrapping* monitoring of @entity7 footage altogether
