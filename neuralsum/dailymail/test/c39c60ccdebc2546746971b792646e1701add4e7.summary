@entity7 's attorney @entity25 conceded that his tactics could be called into question given that @entity7 exposed himself to danger when he stepped onto the hood of a beat - up @entity30 to fire 15 rounds into the windshield of the suspects ' vehicle			1

' they are simple , ordinary people who try to do the best they can and are put in very dangerous situations , ' he said			0
@entity7 , charged with voluntary manslaughter , is the only officer charged because prosecutors said he waited until after the initial salvo had ended to reload and discharge the last of the 49 rounds he fired that night			1
a judge will decide whether @entity7 is guilty or innocent			2
he faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison if convicted			1
assistant @entity60 prosecutor @entity59 revealed that experts have concluded that another officer fired three rounds during @entity7 's 15 - shot volley , something defense attorneys have argued in motions			1
@entity59 said a medical examiner has concluded that @entity7 fired ' kill shots ' into @entity15 and @entity16 and that they were still alive when @entity7 fired from the top of a police cruiser and the trunk of the @entity30 , striking @entity16 11 times and @entity15 six times , when they were no longer a threat to anyone			1
@entity7 fired out of a sense of rage and vengeance after he and his partner became one of the first cars to join what would be a 19 - mile chase on city streets and freeways with speeds reaching 100 mph , @entity59 said			0
@entity10 officer @entity7 is facing charges after two unarmed suspects were killed in this @entity30 @entity16 ( left ) and @entity15 ( right ) were both unarmed when they were killed in november 2012 the prosecutor criticized @entity7 and others for violating departmental policies that required permission to chase a suspect vehicle			1
more than 100 @entity10 police officers in five dozen cars were involved in the chase at some point			0
' his pursuit of 22 minutes described the final outcome , ' @entity59 said of @entity7			0
' he should have never been in that position to begin with			0
' @entity25 argued that officer @entity104 , who fired the initial rounds after @entity15 drove the @entity30 toward him , could have killed @entity15 and @entity16			1
those shots prompted other officers to begin firing because they believed @entity15 and @entity16 were shooting at them			1

' they thought they were in a gun battle			0
' the car was strafed by police gunfire after a high - speed chase over streets and freeways in and around @entity10			0
when @entity7 was questioned by investigators two weeks after the shooting , he told them he did n't recall what happened			2

' ' but i do n't recall that , sir			0
' rookie officer @entity125 who was assigned to the same district as @entity7 , told investigators he stopped firing after ' someone ' jumped on the hood of the @entity30			1
photos released by the @entity11 attorney general show a @entity10 cruiser sitting next to the @entity133 officer @entity125 said he later learned it was @entity7			1
asked how he found out , @entity125 said : ' because [ @entity7 ] was talking about it			1
' while @entity7 claimed not to remember jumping on the hood , prosecutors have evidence to show that he did			0

a judge - not a jury - will decide whether @entity7 is guilty or innocent			2
@entity7 's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds @entity7 fired that night , including the last 15 , were lawful			1
the threat from the pair did n't end until @entity7 reached into the @entity30 and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon , according to his defense			2
@entity15 and @entity16 were each shot more than 20 times			2
the chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he 'd lost sight of the vehicle			0
@entity15 then sped past @entity10 police headquarters , where his car backfired			2
officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they 'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline - fueled rush by officers to join the chase			0

another officer , who said he feared for his life , opened fire , prompting others including @entity7 to do the same			0
@entity7 and his partner fired 15 rounds through their own windshield and told investigators they saw dark objects in @entity15 's and @entity16 ' hands			1
@entity7 said he left his cruiser because he said he was afraid the @entity30 would hit him , even though he then crossed in front of the car to climb on top of another cruiser and open fire again			2
he told investigators : ' i had leapt trying to get out of the way of this car so it does n't run me over and kill me			0
' investigators eventually concluded that neither @entity15 nor @entity16 had a gun			2
an exhaustive search was conducted along the route of the pursuit , including the use of a dive team to look in bodies of water , but no gun was ever found			0
regardless of the trial 's outcome , the after - effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come			0

the city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce			0
