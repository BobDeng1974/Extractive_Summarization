by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 3 may 2013 updated : 06:51 est , 4 may 2013 @entity1 took out a claim against airline @entity3 after he found that he was paying £ 444 more than his @entity5 counterparts millions of @entity7 @entity3 customers could be entitled to refunds after a passenger won a fight for compensation which the company tried to hush up			1
the budget airline has been accused of charging @entity7 more than passengers booking flights in other countries – and has tacitly conceded the anomaly by repaying @entity1 more than £ 400			1
they handed over the money rather than face a race discrimination claim by the @entity22 - based classical musician			1
and a snapshot survey yesterday revealed the price difference applies to several other @entity3 routes			2
now a consumer group has said other @entity7 customers of the airline , which carries 80million people a year , may be eligible for refunds			0
mr @entity1 was alerted to the discrepancy when he paid £ 2,378.32 for seven return tickets between @entity33 and @entity34 for a family holiday this summer			1
he discovered that @entity3 customers booking from @entity34 would have paid the same headline price , but in euros			1
using the exchange rate at the time he made the purchase , which was £ 1 to 1.23 euros , continental customers would have paid £ 1,933.59 – a difference of £ 444.73			1
after failing to get a satisfactory explanation for the mark - up , mr @entity1 found he could bring a case of indirect race discrimination through @entity48 ’s @entity47			1
however before it could consider the complaint , the airline called him and agreed to settle			0
a follow - up letter offered to refund the difference between the ticket prices if he abandoned the case			0
the letter said that the deal was ‘ strictly subject to you agreeing to keep the settlement confidential ’			0
mr @entity1 did not agree to the gagging order , but @entity3 has paid the money in to his account			1
mr @entity1 , from @entity62 , north @entity22 , said : ‘ @entity7 travellers are paying considerably more for the same trip			2
it is not as if it is a greater distance or they need to use more fuel			0
i have a feeling they responded because they were in a sticky situation			0
i would like to see them refund everyone			0
i do n’t think they should charge different rates to different people			0
’ @entity3 have settled with mr @entity73 's by paying him compensation rather than go to court @entity76 , from the @entity77 , said : ‘ @entity3 is notoriously careful about money so if they think it was worth paying to gag the story , then it must be worth consumers getting claim letters in the post as soon as they can			2
‘ a little windfall in these difficult times would never be unwelcome			0
’ a spokesman for the airline said : ‘ passengers pay for flights in the currency their flight departs from			2

@entity1 brought accused @entity3 of indirect race discrimination
he paid £ 2,378.32 for seven flights for his family to @entity34
but , he found that had he paid elsewhere he would have saved £ 444.73
@entity3 settled with the musician , paying him compensation
