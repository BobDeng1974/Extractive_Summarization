by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd sir @entity1 said in his autobiography that letting @entity5 centre half @entity3 leave was his biggest mistake - but it must have been run close by the signing of @entity9			1
the @entity12 forward 's nightmare spell at @entity13 is finally over as he joins @entity14 in a deal worth up to £ 2.4million - four years after @entity17 's legendary boss spent £ 7.4million on him without even watching a video			1
the deal represents a £ 5million loss on the initial investment - but @entity22 fans will just be happy to see their most ridiculed purchase through the exit door			0
@entity17 paid @entity38 £ 7.4million for the striker in 2010 , but he only started three games - all in the cup competitions			1
he made seven appearances in total but never looked like making it into the @entity17 first team and he was shipped out on loan to @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48			0
flop : just three first team starts in a @entity17 shirt hardly made @entity9 good value for his £ 7.4million price tag what am i doing here ? @entity9 trains with @entity17 before a @entity56 game against @entity57 his spell with the latter last year brought 13 goals in 32 games , almost winning him a place in @entity65 's @entity64 squad , as well as sparking the interest of the @entity68 champions			2
on friday , @entity14 confirmed they had bought the player , releasing a statement on their website which read : ' @entity9 has signed an agreement with @entity14 for four years			0
' new horizons : @entity9 impressed on loan with @entity48 last season , prompting @entity14 's interest			0

reds make £ 5million loss on the @entity12 forward bought in 2010
sir @entity1 signed @entity9 without even having watched a video
£ 7.4million flop made just three @entity17 starts - all in cup competitions
@entity13 club will get 50 % of any sell - on
@entity9 had a *productive* season last year at @entity48
