@entity0 and its moons may be nearly a billion miles away , but scientists now say they can pinpoint their location to within just two miles ( 4 km )			0
the discovery was made using ten antennae spread over an area from @entity7 to the @entity8			1
the calculation improves astronomers ' knowledge of @entity0 's orbit and could allow @entity13 to better navigate its probes through space			1
they combined this data with information about @entity21 's orbit from @entity13 's @entity31			1
the combined observations allowed the scientists to make the most accurate determinations yet of the position of the centre of mass , or barycentre , of @entity0 and its numerous moons			0
@entity13 claims the measurement is some 50 times more precise than those provided by ground - based optical telescopes			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) antenna assembly used signals sent by the @entity21 probe to exactly monitor the position of the gas giant			1
pictured are the location of the ten sites @entity13 claims the measurement of @entity0 and its moons using its new method is now some 50 times more precise than those provided by ground - based optical telescopes			1
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) is a system of ten radio - telescope antennas , each with a dish 82ft ( 25 metres ) in diameter and weighing 240 tonnes			1
from @entity55 on the @entity56 to @entity57 in the @entity58 , the @entity19 spans more than 5,000 miles ( 8,000 km ) , providing astronomers with the sharpest vision of any telescope on @entity62 or in space			2
dedicated in 1993 , the @entity19 has an ability to see fine detail equivalent to being able to stand in @entity66 and read a newspaper in @entity68			0
source : @entity70 ' this work is a great step toward tying together our understanding of the orbits of the outer planets of our solar system and those of the inner planets , ' said @entity80 of @entity81 , who led the study			0
the improved accuracy will help enhance precise navigation of interplanetary spacecraft and help refine measurements of the masses of solar system objects			0
it will also improve predictions of when @entity0 or its rings will pass in front of background stars -- events that provide a variety of research opportunities for astronomers			0
previously , the navigators performed their own estimates of the positions of @entity0 and its satellites using data gleaned by tracking @entity21 's radio signal during its communications with @entity62			2
the new calculations , enhanced by @entity19 data , are about 20 times more accurate			0
professor @entity80 and colleagues plan to continue the joint observations with @entity21 and the @entity19 through the end of @entity21 's mission in late 2017			2
the team will also use similar techniques to observe the motion of @entity13 's @entity115 spacecraft when it reaches @entity116 in mid- 2016			0
the findings were reported at a meeting of the @entity119 in @entity120			0
the @entity19 ( @entity19 ) is a system of ten radio - telescope antennas , each with a dish 82ft ( 25 metres ) in diameter and weighing 240 tonnes			2
pictured is the @entity19 site in @entity128 , @entity129 the team at @entity13 combined the data with information about @entity21 's orbit ( artist 's impression pictured )			1

the discovery was made using ten antennae , known as the @entity19 , spread over an area from @entity7 to the @entity8
they combined this data with information on the orbit of @entity21 probe
the data is 50 better than those made with ground - based telescopes
calculation could allow @entity13 to better navigate probes through space
