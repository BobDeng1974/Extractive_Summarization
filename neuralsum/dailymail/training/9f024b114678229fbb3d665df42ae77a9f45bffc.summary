you ’ve had the announcement that @entity2 and @entity3 will meet again in what i believe to be the biggest @entity7 fight of all time			1
they have been slagging each other off privately on @entity11 for weeks – more of that later – and now it ’s time to work out some of the logistics			1
i can reveal here that my two frontrunners for the venue on may 31 are the @entity18 and @entity19			2
it is a massive logistical challenge to stage a fight of this magnitude just a day later but i am doing everything i can to make sure i have the best options available			2
we are also looking at @entity43 and the @entity44 in @entity45 , but my heart says this is a @entity47 fight			1
this is a statement fight , a fight that will show where boxing stands			2
front runner : the 60,000 - seater @entity18 could host the @entity7 @entity52 between @entity2 and @entity3 on may 31 big event : @entity19 remains in the running to host the big bout too despite @entity32 playing @entity34 there 24 hours beforehand for me , i want nothing less than the challenge of getting a massive stadium and filling it because i think this fight merits that			1
as part of making that statement , i think it does n’t get much bigger than @entity19			2
the @entity18 would be superb as well			2
i was there at the weekend to watch @entity67 beat @entity68 and the facilities are outstanding			0
like anything in boxing , we have to crunch the numbers and see what offers the best value , but , like i said , i do not want to undersell this fight			2
i believe we can fill a huge arena			0
vintage : late great @entity80 and legendary heavyweight champion @entity79 fought twice - the first at @entity19 in 1963 rematch : @entity83 hosted the 1966 rematch between @entity80 and @entity79 , where the @entity85 retain his heavyweight title with victory some people in the industry tell me this is a fight for 60,000 people			1
that would be perfect for the @entity18			0
but i do think we can do 80,000 people			0
more than 20,000 people have already signed up to our ticket alert site and i think we could sell 40,000 tickets in a day			0
that is also why , as much as @entity2 would love to fight in @entity45 , i want to look at bigger venues			1
@entity67 would love to stage it			0
they staged @entity79 - @entity80 at @entity83 in 1966 and one of their directors , @entity101 , was telling me how much they want to be involved			0
it ’s going to be a special night			0
i can also reveal here the depth of the hate between @entity2 and @entity3			1
i became aware a few weeks back , while @entity3 was making his appeals to the @entity108 , that they had started sending direct messages to each other on @entity11 ! @entity3 was accusing @entity2 of ducking him , @entity2 was biting back and saying he was going to knock him out			1
they must have sent 12 messages each , @entity2 and @entity113 responding			1
tricky trees : @entity2 , pictured with former @entity116 striker @entity115 in 2006 , would love to fight at his beloved @entity44 ... and it remains a possibility on the list : @entity43 , home of @entity120 , could see @entity2 and @entity3 return to the city of their first fight @entity125 will prove he is the best of @entity7 by going after @entity127 and @entity128 ... but superstar must wait until next year @entity130 must happen this year ... and my dream is to have it at @entity19 in front of 80,000 fans it ’s that animosity that has made this the single most challenging promotion i have ever been involved with			1
there is so much genuine hatred there that every point of negotiation has been a battle			0
neither man wanted to give up anything			0
it got to the point where , among a bunch of other things , they were arguing over what seats their guests would have at ringside and no - one wanted to back down			0
thankfully we got there in the end			2
@entity3 has worked tirelessly to force this fight and @entity2 appreciates what the public wants			1
he has never ducked a fight in his life and after some of the things that were said following the last one i think he feels he has a few scores to settle			2
unfinished business : @entity2 wants to put the @entity3 saga behind him once and for good when they meet again bitter feeling : @entity3 remains upset over his controversial stoppage by referee @entity175 when he lost to @entity2 last november it has bothered him , some of the stick he has taken from the public , because @entity2 has spent his career proving he is one of the great warriors in the history of the sport			1
now he is going in with some real purpose			0
that makes him an extremely dangerous man fighting an extremely talented young fighter who is convinced he can win			2
this fight is huge and whichever stadium we end up in will reflect that			1
imagine the build up , the anticipation and that epic night with the biggest crowd in post-war boxing history as both of these great fighters put it all on the line			0
it ’s making the hairs on my neck stand up just talking about it			0
ready to rumble : @entity2 and @entity3 ca n't wait to meet each other in the ring again as they prepare to embark on a huge nationwide roadshow to promote their blockbuster bout @entity209 is back in @entity210 on march 1 for the most important fight of his career			1
it says everything about the guy that he ’s excited to face such a quality fighter as @entity217 in his first fight since what happened against @entity220			1
i ’ll never forget visiting @entity209 in the hospital after that fight , i ’ve never seen a man is so much pain			1
he was lucky and unlucky that night			0
he was lucky to get a draw , but unlucky to fight for half an hour with a broken jaw			2
boxers are different to normal people , but not many could endure what he did that night			0
last time out : @entity209 managed to keep his world title despite being floored by @entity220 in his last contest pain game : @entity209 escaped with a draw in a hard - fought warn with @entity220 back in september last year hurt : @entity209 suffered a broken jaw during the @entity220 clash in @entity210 when i saw him on the hospital ward , he was screaming			1
he was in so much pain , pure agony			0
the fact he fought through that just makes you appreciate how tough he is			0
he needs to be ready for this @entity217 fight			1
@entity217 is red hot , dangerous and has won all 22 of his fights - 16 by knockout			1
he is tough , he is @entity209 ’s mandatory challenger and i think it is the best fight in the lightweight division			1
oddly enough , it ’s the kind of fight @entity209 will love			1
he is a raw fighting man			0
i ’m sure he does n’t even spend what we pay him – he does n’t go in for @entity256 , mansions and all that			0
he still works each saturday in his mate ’s sports shop			0
he does n’t need to do it , but he does			0
can he win this fight ? a lot of people do n’t think so , but i think he will , possibly by a late stoppage			1
it ’s interesting that before this fight @entity217 did n’t have a passport and has never been outside the @entity85			1
how will he travel ? how will he adapt when he sees and hears 10,000 @entity270 screaming for @entity262 ? i think that will be a big factor			2
from that point of view , i am calling on all @entity270 to make yourselves heard and get @entity262 over the line , he is a true champ			2
challenger : @entity85 @entity217 will arrive in @entity270 with an unbeaten record from 22 fights with 16 victories coming by the way of knockout on the undercard , we have @entity285 fighting @entity286			1
that is set up to be a belter			0
this guy took @entity128 nine rounds less than a year ago , so people are going to get a real idea of where @entity293 is in his development			0
big time : unbeaten @entity125 will fight this saturday in @entity298 against tough opponent @entity289 @entity299 has his fifth fight on saturday in @entity298			1
every time i watch him i admire just how talented he is			0
like @entity293 , he is an @entity304 champion , one of the finest talents i have ever seen and we are plotting the early stages of his career			2
my view is that this will be his last tune - up fight and then we will put him in at title level			2
i would say that by the end of the year he will have a @entity7 title and by the end of 2015 he ’ll be a world champion			1
heading for the top : @entity318 gold medal hero @entity299 has been tipped to become a world champion by the end of 2015 @entity320 - to - head : @entity26 captured @entity299 ( @entity322 ) sparring with @entity323 last week and posted this picture on his @entity11 account he is more experienced than @entity125 – he had well over 100 amateur fights – and i ’ve been amazed by how well he has equipped himself in sparring people like @entity209 and @entity323			1
he is a 5ft 9ins southpaw lightweight – he is heading for the top			0

a few of you might have noticed on @entity11 than i am running in the @entity329 to raise money for the @entity331			1
there ’s another story behind that			0
my dad , @entity340 , watched that film @entity341 a while back and one of the things he wants is to see me run a marathon			0
he ’s done nine and always gives me stick about it			0
it ’s better than his last tick off the list			0
he went to @entity350 and got his first tattoo – a heart with fire on his arm saying family			2
it ’s the worst thing you ’ve ever seen ! family man : @entity26 is running the marathon to help his @entity360 , @entity340 ( r ) , tick off another item in his ' bucket list '			1
