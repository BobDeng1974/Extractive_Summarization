investigators who are trying to determine why a passenger jet dropped more than 5,000 feet in @entity3 airspace say the co-pilot ‘ fiddled ’ with aircraft controls			2
the incident occurred while the captain of the @entity9 @entity8 777 - 300 was taking a nap during a @entity12 - to - @entity13 flight in august			1
the co-pilot claimed she was busy doing work on her tablet and did not notice the drop in altitude as the plane carried around 280 passengers			0
a senior @entity28 official told the @entity35 : ‘ this appears to be a serious act of criminal negligence on part of the co-pilot			0
‘ it was n’t as if the plane went into a free fall and the pilots were unaware of it			2
' the @entity8 report clearly establishes that the co-pilot fiddled with the controls of the aircraft after which the plane dropped 5,000 feet			1
’ in a statement provided to @entity50 , the airline said : ‘ @entity9 has initiated an internal inquiry into the matter and shared the @entity8 report with the regulator to assist with the investigation			1
however , the airline is unable to comment till such time the full investigations are over			0
' safety is of paramount importance to @entity9 , as is also the welfare of our guests and crew and the airline will always take appropriate steps to ensure the same			0
’ the pilots received an emergency call from an air traffic controller in @entity69 , who demanded to know why the aircraft had descended from its assigned flight level of 34,000ft			1
