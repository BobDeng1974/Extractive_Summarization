president @entity1 has ruled out an immediate campaign of air strikes against a militant @entity5 terror group that is running roughshod over @entity6 , senior administration officials told reporters on wednesday			1
when he meets at 3:00 p.m. with congressional leaders from both parties , he will reportedly explain his preference for continued diplomacy and intelligence gathering for @entity6 's army over bombing and guided - missile campaigns			1
although the president has n't made a final decision – that will likely come by week 's end – plugged - in officials are talking quietly about a ' comprehensive ' approach that would include deploying limited numbers of @entity23 and applying pressure to @entity6 's @entity26 government to be more inclusive of the country 's @entity28 minority			1
a 5:10 p.m. meeting with secretary of state @entity31 will follow the president ' sit - down with key members of @entity34 , according to his schedule			0
@entity1 's military commanders , according to multiple news accounts , have been unable to pinpoint the locations of key @entity40 targets , making precision bombing unlikely to succeed			2
and carpet bombing of the ' shock and awe ' brand that @entity66 saw in the 1989 , they say , would inflict mass civilian casualties while doing little to slow down @entity40 as it tries to capture @entity46 and depose the government			2
instead , @entity69 reported wednesday , @entity1 is leaning toward a strategy that puts @entity71 on the ground to help the @entity6 army gather intelligence while diplomats pressure prime minister @entity76 to be more inclusive of his countrymen on the opposite side of @entity6 's political divide			1
according to @entity83 , a deployment of 100 special operators from among the @entity66 armed forces is being considered			0
in advance of wednesday 's @entity42 confab , @entity85 senate majority leader @entity84 said he would n't support any deployment of military personnel to @entity6 to intervene in what amounts to a civil war			0
' it 's time for the @entity6 to resolve it themselves , ' said @entity84 , adding that ' those who attack president @entity1 for bringing our troops home from @entity6 are wrong and out of step with the @entity66 people			2
' @entity1 has said he will not put ' boots on the ground ' in @entity6 but told @entity34 on monday that as many as 275 @entity66 forces , ' armed for combat , ' are being sent to @entity46 to protect @entity66 interests as embassy staff and assets are moved to safer places			0
sunnis on the march : @entity111 sympathizers in @entity6 openly demonstrate in favor of the terror group @entity40 as it takes over more and more of northern and central @entity6 while @entity6 descended further into chaos , @entity1 returned to the @entity42 tuesday night following a fundraising trip to @entity116 that also included a speech at a gay rights gala according to the @entity121 , @entity120 chairman gen. @entity119 said wednesday that the @entity6 government has asked the @entity66 for air strikes against @entity40 's militants			1
but with @entity6 in bloody chaos , it may be impossible for @entity66 intelligence agencies to confirm the locations of the group 's top leaders including @entity131			2
@entity40 is the same group that came to power with the name @entity40			0
an @entity135 report cites an unnamed @entity1 administration official saying that if the president chooses to launch air strikes , the result would be a limited campaign of surgical drone strikes similar to @entity66 intervention in @entity143 and @entity144			1
that possibility has the @entity146 speculating about the political fallout if @entity1 announces any kind of offensive			0
' the limited scale of any military action may make it easier for mr. @entity1 to sell to @entity34 and the public , ' the @entity146 reports .			0
