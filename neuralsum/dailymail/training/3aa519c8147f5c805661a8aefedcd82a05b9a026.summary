by @entity0 published : 12:00 est , 9 april 2013 updated : 04:31 est , 10 april 2013 when you 're partnered with the president , being constantly followed by cameras and reporters becomes a part of every day life			0
but when he has been in office less than a year , the press attention might still come as something of an unwanted novelty			0
@entity14 president @entity13 's long - term partner @entity12 was caught on camera losing her composure with a cameraman while on a walkabout on saturday			1
tense : @entity12 ( right ) is pictured on a walkabout of @entity20 in the @entity22 area of the @entity24 area of central @entity14 with her partner @entity13 on saturday drastic action : in the press melee that accompanied the president and his girlfriend , ms @entity12 was seen grabbing hold of a cameraman 's hood a clip , shown on @entity37 programme @entity35 , shows mr @entity13 and the first lady on a walkabout tour of @entity20 in the @entity22 area of the @entity24 area of central @entity14			1
the footage shows the pair surrounded by camera men and reporters and mr @entity13 is shown on at least one occasion telling the group to calm down			2
but as mr @entity13 stops to speak to reporters , an increasingly agitated ms @entity12 becomes separated from the president who is by now surrounded by the press pack			0
standing behind one television cameraman and unable to get by , ms @entity12 decides that rather than leave the situation to the pair 's team of minders she will take matters into her own hands			2
the footage shows ms @entity12 grab hold of the cameraman 's hood and pull him back as hard as she possibly can			1
move it : she uses the cameraman 's hood to pull him out of the way and get past the press pack the cameraman soon moves out of the way and 48 - year - old ms @entity12 is back at her husband 's side			1
after the footage was aired on french television on monday night , @entity69 , ms @entity12 's chief of staff , took to @entity72 to defend her actions			0
he claimed that ms @entity12 had been ' shaken ' by the group of cameramen several times and that she had n't been treated with ' courtesy '			0
mr @entity13 's presidency has been somewhat blighted by the massive unpopularity of his girlfriend ms @entity12 , who has been accused in some quarters of abandoning her socialist principles for a life of ' luxury and frivolity '			1
her former boss , glossy weekly @entity86 's owner @entity85 , described ms @entity12 last year as like ' an unpinned grenade ' last year .			0
