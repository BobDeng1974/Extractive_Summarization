weeks after some @entity2 users reported spotting a catch - up feature in their news feeds , the social network has announced it is rolling out a ‘ while you were away ’ summary feature across its apps and website			1
the tool shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important , and that the user may have missed since they last logged in			1
the best tweets are displayed at the top of a user ’s timeline when they open the site and are similar to the ' top stories ' prioritised on @entity21			1
at last ! @entity2 has announced it is rolling out a ‘ while you were away ’ summary feature ( illustrated ) across its apps and website			0
the tool shows users a selection of tweets that it considers to be important , and that the user may have missed since they last logged in in a blog post detailing the changes , product manager , @entity31 wrote : ' today we ’re introducing something new to your home timeline : a recap of some of the top @entity40 you might have missed from accounts you follow			1
' ' our goal is to help you keep up - or catch up - with your world , no matter how much time you spend on @entity2			0
' with a few improvements to the home timeline we think we can do a better job of delivering on that promise without compromising the real time nature of @entity2 ' the feature was first spotted by a number of users over @entity54			2
it works in a similar way to @entity21 ’s news feed feature , which ranks status updates in terms of importance , instead of in chronological order			1

the best tweets are displayed at the top of a user ’s timeline when they open the site , and are similar to the ' top stories ' prioritised on @entity21			1
@entity2 did n't explicitly explain how it prioritises tweets , but said that it will pull out the best ones ' determined by engagement and other factors ' to fill in the gaps			0
@entity2 said the new feature is designed to help users keep up and catch up with news , no matter how regularly they check @entity2			1
the update will roll out on @entity92 devices from today and will be coming ' soon ' to @entity94 devices and twitter.com			1
the @entity21 tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear - and the @entity2 update is likely to cause similar frustrations			1
the site did not explicitly reveal how it prioritises tweets , or what it considers ' important ' but said that it will pull out the best tweets , ' determined by engagement and other factors ' to fill in the gaps in news while users are away			2
mr @entity31 explained : ' if you check in on @entity2 now and then for a quick snapshot of what ’s happening , you ’ll see this recap more often ; if you spend a lot of time on @entity2 already , you ’ll see it less			0
' users who access @entity2 on iphones and @entity116 will begin to see the ' while you were away ' feature from today , while it will appear on the company 's @entity94 app and twitter.com ' soon '			1
@entity2 first announced its plans to roll out features to boost engagement in november , stating at the time : ‘ every time you open the @entity2 app , you ’ll see something great			2
’ it added : ‘ we can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app. ’ the best tweets are displayed at the top of a user ’s timeline when they open the app ( pictured ) or website - a new feature , which has delighted some , while annoying others who took to @entity2 to complain it works in a similar way to @entity21 ’s top stories news feed feature , which ranks status updates in terms of importance , instead of in chronological order ( pictured )			1
the @entity21 tool has previously angered some users who believe they should be able to choose how stories appear in november @entity2 revealed its plans for the ‘ while you were away ’ feature			2
here is what it said in a blog post : ' right now , what you see of the 500 million tweets published every day is based entirely on who you follow , and that ’s a great model for many people			0
' but with that many tweets every day , there ’s no way even the most avid @entity2 user will find everything that ’s relevant to their interests in any particular moment			2
' that ’s why we ’re exploring ways to surface relevant tweets so the content that is interesting to you is easy to discover - whether you stay on @entity2 all day or visit for a few minutes - while still preserving the real - time nature of the platform that makes @entity2 special			2
' for instance , we ’re experimenting with better ways to give you what you come to @entity2 for : a snapshot of what ’s happening			0
' we can use information like who you follow and what you engage with to surface highlights of what you missed and show those to you as soon as you log back in or come back to the app. ' we ’re also working on ideas such as an instant , personalised timeline for new users who do n’t want to spend time cultivating one on their own			0
' the ' while you were away ' feature is the first one rolled out by the company , based in @entity203 , @entity204 , since it launched promoted tweets and adverts , which also buck its chronological approach			0
the tool is designed to attract a user 's attention to important tweets that can get easily lost in the rapid flow of information , especially if they follow hundreds of people , or do not check their feed very regularly			2
a staggering 500 million tweets are published every day			0
people reacted on @entity2 to the change , with some pouring scorn on the new feature			0
before the official roll - out was announced , one user wrote : ' @entity2 new feature to tell me what happened while i was away			2
i was away because i did n't want to know anything ' , while another said : ‘ why does @entity2 show me tweets from last night " while you were away "			0
’ however , one @entity232 user was among many who praised the change , saying : ‘ love the ' while you were away ' feature at @entity2			0
achieves its purpose without affecting real time news feed ! ’ the new feature may be seen as a move by @entity2 to close in on @entity21 ’s social media lead , which has 1.3 billion users , compared to @entity2 ’s 284 million			1
@entity2 is expected to roll out another new feature called ‘ instant timeline ’ to reinvigorate current users and attract news ones early this year			1
last year , @entity247 leapfrogged @entity2 to become the third most used social media app ( pictured )			0

@entity21 still reigns as the most popular , however , with more than 75 per cent of millennials using it , closely followed by @entity257 with 43 per cent			0
@entity247 's popularity is growing among 25 to 34 - year - olds , and in the over 35 age group - albeit more slowly than among the younger age group			0
