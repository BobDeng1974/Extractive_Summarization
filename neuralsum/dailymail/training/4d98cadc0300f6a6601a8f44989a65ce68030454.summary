with bold colours and long trails , these photographs look more like a painting of the night 's sky by @entity6 post-impressionist painter @entity5			0
but in fact photographer @entity7 managed to capture these dazzling images using a custom rig of four cameras - each with a fish eye lens attached to give a 360 degree view			1
he managed to achieve a series of images that show the paths that the stars etch through the sky above some of the most beautiful landscapes in the @entity22			1
@entity24 's @entity23 , like this one of @entity25 in @entity26 , resemble @entity5 's masterpiece @entity28 by combining the images taken by the four cameras together he has been able to create pictures that take on an almost surreal quality			1
the technique has also enabled him to produce real pictures that bear a striking resemblance to @entity5 's masterpiece @entity28			0
mr @entity7 said : ' the @entity36 is rotating at a steady 1,040mph - i created a custom rig of four cameras with fisheye lenses to capture the entire night - sky in motion			1
' i created them on a number of cold , dark , sleepless nights under awe - spiring skies			0
' mr @entity7 had to obtain special permission from the resident @entity48 to photograph this image of @entity50 in @entity51 overnight mr @entity7 has also used his innovative technique to show how the colours of the @entity54 fill the sky above @entity56 in the picture above mr @entity7 hiked two miles into the @entity59 desert at night to capture this picture of the huge @entity61 , which has a span of 290 feet mr @entity7 set each camera to take photographs continuously for around three hours with exposures of around one minute			1
each camera produces between 100 and 200 images			0
mr @entity7 then edits the images of from the four separate cameras to combine them into startrails			2
he then stitches the resulting four images together to make seamless star trails that he calls @entity23			1
he hit on the technique in 2012 while experimenting with shooting 360 degree views of landscapes			1
he said that he wanted to capture the entire night - sky in motion as the @entity36 rotates at 1,040mph			1
the strange swirls in the sky that appear in @entity28 by @entity6 painter @entity5 have been greatly debated			0
the artist created the masterpiece between 16 and 18 june 1889 from the view out of an asylum window			0
some have claimed that the shapes in the night 's sky were extensions of @entity5 's fragile mental state at the time			2
but a recent claim suggests that the spirals actually depict galaxies and may have been inspired by drawings of the cosmos at the time			0
the claim was made by @entity22 artist and photographer @entity97 in his new book , @entity99			2
of particular interest , he says , is a drawing of the @entity103 - official designation @entity103 - by @entity106 astronomer @entity105 , 3rd @entity107 , in the mid 19th century			0
to observe the night sky , @entity105 built the largest telescope at the time - one with a mirror six feet ( 1.8 metres ) in diameter - with which he observed the galaxy and made his drawing			2
the @entity28 now hangs in @entity116 's @entity115 the swirls in @entity5 's masterpiece @entity28 , one of his most famous paintings , are thought to depict galaxies drawn at the time each image shows how the stars appear to rotate around the north star			2
among the locations he has taken photos are the @entity128 in @entity59 - a 65 feet freestanding archway of rock , @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity50 in @entity51 , and @entity131 at @entity132			0
mr @entity7 said : ' i find the best results when scoping out locations in the daytime before going out into the pitch blackness			2
the custom camera rig used by mr @entity7 ( above ) allows him to capture a 360 degree view of the landscape and sky over several hours trails left by the stars in the sky above @entity128 in @entity59 appear to mirror the layers in the orange sandstone beneath in the image above mr @entity7 has also used his technique to produce globe like 360 degree views of places like the one above of @entity153 in @entity154 the brief flashes of light produced by fireflies also intrigue mr @entity7 and he has used his technique to capture them like in the photo above ' i typically but not always setup just before sundown and take a few photos while sunlight is still present and blend in these shots with the night scene to bring out some details in the elements			1
' my rig has taken me to firefly parties in @entity169 , dark eerie nights at @entity25 and through @entity131 at @entity132			0
' i 've been up the mountains of @entity172 and around the amazing arches and sandstone monuments in the @entity175			0
' the planet seems to revolve around the tip of this totem pole shaped rock in @entity51 thanks to the 360 degree photography technique			1

photographer @entity7 set up four cameras on a special rig to capture hundreds of pictures for each image
the pictures , which he calls @entity23 , show a 360 degree view of *landmarks* around the @entity22
he left the cameras to take pictures for up to three hours at a time , exposing each shot for around one minute
the result is a series of beautiful pictures that show the path taken by the stars through the sky as the @entity36 rotates
