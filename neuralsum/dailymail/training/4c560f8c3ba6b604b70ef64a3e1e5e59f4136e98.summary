by @entity0 a @entity2 furniture store is offering £ 15 gift vouchers to customers who return mugs that the company sold decorated with roses and poems - next to the photograph of @entity11 leader @entity10			1
the sale of anything featuring the former @entity14 is strictly forbidden in modern - day @entity2 and can be punishable with severe fines			2
but the @entity10 - decorated mugs somehow crept into the stock of the @entity20 home improvement store in the city of @entity22 - which remains a base for the @entity25 army in @entity2 to this day			1
the store is now offering a gift voucher to any customer who returns one of the mug the @entity10 decoration on the mugs - which were made in @entity40 - came in the form of an old 30 pfennig stamp with a swastika postmark over it			1
it is not immediately obvious what is depicted on the stamp , although @entity10 is unmistakable under closer scrutiny			0
' i thought i was n’t seeing too well when i saw i had @entity10 sitting down to breakfast with me , ' said @entity51 , who bought one of the mugs for her morning coffee at her home in nearby @entity56			0
banned : the sale of anything featuring @entity10 is strictly forbidden in modern @entity2 the company spoke of a ' pretty stupid amalgam of unfortunate circumstances ' which led to the @entity11 mugs going on sale			1
@entity64 , the owner and managing director of the store , says an investigation is underway to discover how the face of @entity10 made its way on to the ceramics			2
the stamp is printed between petals and poetry and is not detectable with a cursory glance			0
now the store is offering a gift voucher to any customer who returns one of the mugs			2
the @entity40 factory that made them produced 5,000 total , although only 175 actually sold - all for less than £ 3 each			1
the remaining 4825 cups have already been destroyed			0
now the store is offering the voucher in a bid to get back the 175 out of a batch of 5000 made in @entity40 mugs that were actually sold			1
they were sold for less than three pounds each			0
mr @entity64 also apologised profusely and called the incident ' truly terrible			0
' he said the mugs were loaded so quickly on to company shelves that no store workers noticed the ' embarrassing error			0
' the @entity40 factory responsible has also apologised and promised a full investigation .			2
