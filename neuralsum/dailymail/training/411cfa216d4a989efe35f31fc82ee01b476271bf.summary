by @entity1 reporter published : 17:03 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 01:34 est , 13 may 2013 @entity2 's biggest out - of - hours care provider is using senior nurses to cover up to a quarter of a million patients when they can not recruit @entity6 to do the shifts			1
the firm , @entity9 , regularly employs advanced nurse practitioners to work eight - hour overnight shifts covering districts of up to 150 square miles			1
they have a greater range of expertise than a nurse , but critics say they can not be expected to replace a fully - trained family doctor and attend emergency callouts			2
@entity9 , @entity2 's biggest out - of - hours care provider , is using senior nurses to cover up to 250,000 patients at times of staffing pressures , there has been just one advanced nurse practitioner working overnight in @entity25 , which covers 250,000 patients			1
the revelations come from a whistleblower – a gp who worked for the firm in @entity25 – who has made a number of other startling allegations about how the firm is routinely jeopardising safety to cut costs			0
they include : the whistleblower said that working for @entity9 was like ‘ taking a loaded gun and sitting with it because at some point it ’s going to become so unsafe it ’s going to go off			1
' my personal feeling is that at times it has been unsafe			0
it ’s a dereliction of duty			0
everything is secondary to meeting budget			0
patient care is compromised , employee care compromised			2
' it ’s an edict from on high			0
they have thinned rotas down to a bare minimum			0
’ a whisteblower said on one occasion a terminally ill cancer patient had to wait eight hours for pain relief ( file picture ) @entity9 has contracts in @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity25			1
it is responsible for the care of millions of patients and makes £ 100million a year from @entity78 contracts			2
many of its services are now accessed by the controversial 111 service which effectively acts as a call centre when patients try to seek advice if their local surgery is shut			0
but the @entity9 whistleblower revealed that when shifts can not be filled with on - call doctors , advanced nurse practitioners are drafted in instead			1
they are senior nurses earning up to £ 70,000 who have had extra training in advanced medical practice that allows them to carry out some tasks normally done only by a qualified doctor			0
@entity9 has admitted they are used to cover out - of - hours shifts elsewhere in the country when it is unable to find doctors			1
the firm claimed there would always be a gp on call at home to provide ‘ covering support ’			0
but the whistleblower , who has requested anonymity , said he was once telephoned by a nurse who was desperate for advice on treating a patient with a complicated condition			0
in march , he said , @entity9 was forced to draft in a nurse from @entity68 to cover a night shift in @entity25			2
the whistleblower said many family doctors no longer volunteered to work out - of - hours shifts for @entity9 because of the intense workload			1
instead , less experienced locum doctors drive down from @entity62 and do blocks of shifts spanning several days			1
incredibly , the firm also relies on several @entity123 doctors who fly to @entity124 by @entity125 from @entity126 and @entity127 – and some ‘ clearly struggle ’ with the @entity129 language			1
the whistleblower said @entity9 assumed the @entity129 - speaking abilities of foreign doctors had been tested by the @entity78 trust			1
last year , according to the whistleblower , a man dying of cancer waited eight hours for a doctor to give him pain relief			1
he also alleged that last month a manager instructed a junior official to change the figures on a spreadsheet for waiting times so they were more ‘ favourable			0
’ a spokesman for @entity9 said : ‘ on very rare occasions , and only after consultation and agreement with our commissioning colleagues in @entity25 that the service remained clinically safe , we have run an overnight shift with a very experienced advanced nurse practitioner providing the first point of contact with a gp available on - call to support with any advice needed			2
’ @entity9 relies on several doctors who fly from @entity126 and @entity127 and some ' clearly struggle ' with @entity129 when asked if this happened elsewhere in the country , @entity9 added : ‘ advanced nurse practitioners do have certain limitations on the care they can provide such as with very young children and palliative care			1
‘ therefore , on the occasions when they are the first point of patient contact , we ensure there is always covering support available from a gp			0
for @entity9 , and indeed virtually all out - of - hours providers , there are some occasions where filling all the planned @entity102 rota slots is a challenge			2
’ when asked if staff were ever asked to change performance figures to make them look more favourable , the spokesman said : ‘ our performance figures are accurately recorded in line with national guidelines and , again , carefully scrutinised by our commissioning colleagues			0
’ the @entity182 said : ‘ it is a legal requirement for the @entity78 to make sure the right , high quality out - of - hours services are in place for patients in their area			2
if this is not happening , it is totally unacceptable			0

care provider @entity193 uses nurse practitioners to work eight - hour overnight shifts when they can not recruit @entity6 to do the shifts
@entity198 , who works for @entity9 , claims situation is like a ' loaded gun '
said locum doctors fly from @entity123 to work back - to - back shifts
claimed terminally - ill cancer patient had to wait eight hours for pain relief
said foreign doctors with poor grasp of @entity129 being used to plug rota gaps

terminally - ill cancer patients made to wait eight hours for a doctor to visit them at home and administer pain relief ;
foreign doctors with a poor grasp of @entity129 being used to plug gaps in the rota ;
