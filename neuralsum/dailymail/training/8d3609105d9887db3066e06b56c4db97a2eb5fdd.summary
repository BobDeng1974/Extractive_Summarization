by @entity0 prime minister @entity1 is under pressure to deliver on his pledge to claw powers back from @entity5 @entity7 ’s opposition to draconian @entity5 ’ measures has been over-ruled by the @entity9 on every occasion since records began			1
official figures show that the @entity7 government has failed to stop 55 new laws being introduced by the @entity15 since 1996			1
experts said it was evidence that @entity7 had little influence in @entity20 and over other member states			2
@entity22 , ceo of the pressure group @entity23 , said : ‘ it is clear that @entity7 ’s influence in @entity20 is not as high as many would have us believe			2
' with the @entity9 regularly acting against the @entity7 ’s national interest , the government must push for proper safeguards in the forthcoming renegotiation			1
’ @entity9 legislation that @entity7 has tried to block includes restrictions on car emissions which the @entity7 government warned would cost the @entity7 up to £ 56 billion and the draft 2013 @entity9 budget which the @entity38 said would cost the @entity7 £ 8.6 bn			1
the @entity7 ’s voting power in the @entity40 has decreased from 17 per cent to 8 per cent since 1973 , when it first joined the @entity20 community			0
in the @entity44 , it has also more than halved from 20 per cent to 9.5 per cent and in the @entity46 it plummeted from 15 per cent to 4 per cent			0
the figures for how objections have been ignored - obtained under freedom of information requests - came just days after polling by @entity51 , the former @entity52 party treasurer , revealed that 72 per cent of @entity7 had no confidence in the country ’s ability to secure a better deal from @entity5			0
@entity7 has voted ‘ no ’ on 55 separate occasions since 1996 - but on every occasion , that legislation was passed by the @entity15			1
business for @entity7 called for a ‘ red card system ’ - backed by many @entity62 - that would allow national parliaments to join together and veto new @entity20 laws			1
the group also backed chancellor @entity67 ’s push for two separate votes to take place - one for @entity70 members and one of @entity73 countries			0
both groups would have to vote in favour of a measure for it to be adopted			0
the @entity7 ¿ s voting power in the @entity44 has more than halved from 20 per cent to 9.5 per cent critics pointed out that the @entity9 was increasingly operating on @entity79 rather than unanimity			2
this removes @entity7 ’s ability to veto laws that are against its national interest			1
but a spokesman for the foreign secretary disputed the methodology used by @entity23 , pointing out votes against were usually only recorded when a vote was likely to be pushed through			0
he said : ‘ this report is not accurate			0
@entity91 usually only vote when there is a qualified majority in favour so , by definition , if the @entity7 is opposed on an issue that goes to a vote we are going to lose			0
’ the spokesman added : ‘ the report does n’t look at the countless times we have worked with allies behind the scenes to block proposals that are not in @entity7 interests , or to negotiate changes to turn them to our advantage			2
‘ from the first ever cut to the @entity9 ’s budget to getting @entity7 out of @entity70 bail outs to fundamental reform of the disastrous fisheries policy to protections in @entity113 , this government is succeeding in bringing real change to the @entity9			1
’ he added that the @entity7 had successfully blocked the establishment of an operational military hq for a @entity20 military in 2011 but this had not been recorded by the study .			0
