@entity0 looks set to make history next week as the president with the worst successive results in midterm congressional elections in more than 60 years			1
@entity0 's @entity5 lost 63 @entity7 seats in 2010 and is expected to lose a further five to 12 when votes come in next week , although some speculators suggest the result could be even worse			1
he stands to lose a combined total of somewhere between 68 to 75 @entity7 seats - the worst total of any two - term president since @entity15 shed 55 @entity7 seats in 1946 and a further 28 in 1950 - a total of 83			1
call me a taxi : @entity0 looks set to suffer the worst successive midterm defeats of any @entity22 president in 60 years the only glimmer of hope for @entity0 is that if he exceeds expectations he has a chance of beating the record of @entity29 @entity28 , who lost a combined 66 @entity7 seats in 1954 and 1958			1
by contrast @entity32 lost a combined 22 seats ( 30 in 2002 but up eight in 2006 ) , @entity31 lost a combined 49 ( 54 in 1994 but up five in 1998 ) while @entity35 lost a combined 31 ( 26 in 1982 and five in 1986 )			2
and it does n't get much better for @entity0 in the @entity38 where he expected to lose between five and ten seats next week , taking his combined losses to somewhere between 11 and 16 seats			1
that would compare to a total of five seats for @entity32 , eight for @entity31 and seven for @entity35			0
@entity28 lost a total of 13 @entity38 seats in his two midterms and @entity15 a whopping 17			1
@entity28 , left , lost a combined 66 @entity7 seats in 1954 and 1958 , while @entity15 , right , shed 55 @entity7 seats in 1946 and a further 28 in 1950 - a total of 83 for the @entity29 the big question next week is whether they can gain enough @entity7 seats to rival their @entity54 high water mark of 246			1
the current breakdown is 233 - 199 in favor of the @entity29 , with three vacancies			0
@entity29 have their eyes on states where @entity0 cruised to double - digit victories , with the @entity5 fighting to cling on to the once friendly terrain of @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity0 's native state of @entity64 , and his adopted state of @entity66			1
' we 're in trench warfare			0
i 'm not going to sugarcoat it , ' said @entity62 rep. @entity71 , the chairman of the @entity72			0
bogeyman : @entity0 's slumping approval ratings have been a drag on @entity5 , and he has kept a relatively low profile during the campaign period @entity0 , whose slumping approval has been a drag on @entity5 in the fiercely - fought congressional elections , has limited his campaign appearances mostly to races for governors in states where he remains popular			1
in @entity85 he is keeping his distance so as not to get drawn in to the current controversy over the state 's @entity89 quarantine policies and the nurse who has defied them			0
hot issue : the treatment of @entity89 nurse @entity95 is threatening to unseat the @entity5 in @entity85 his appearance there on thursday landed him at the epicenter of a debate between the federal government and several states over how health care workers returning from @entity89 - stricken nations should be monitored			2
the @entity7 has pushed back against overly restrictive measures , including proposals for travel bans or isolation measures adopted by some states			0
@entity0 , who has been praising health care workers who have volunteered to fight @entity89 in @entity111 , had no plans to visit with @entity95 , the nurse who worked with @entity89 victims in @entity115 and is now challenging @entity85 's requirement that she isolate herself for 21 days			0
@entity95 returned to the @entity22 last week but has shown no symptoms of the disease			0
she has been under what the state has called a voluntary quarantine in remote northern @entity85 , but on thursday she went on a bike ride with her boyfriend			0
the elections feature races for governor in 36 states , although those contests have been overshadowed by competitive congressional races			0
the fight for control of the @entity38 is the biggest prize in the midterm elections , with @entity5 struggling to fend off a @entity29 takeover			2
the @entity29 need to pick up six seats to take control of the @entity38 , and they are widely expected to expand their majority in the @entity137			2
that would give them control of @entity140 for the two years @entity0 has left in office .			2

@entity0 's @entity5 lost 63 seats in 2010 , expected to lose five - 12 next week
that would be a combined total of up to 75 seats in @entity140
@entity15 shed 55 @entity7 seats in 1946 and a further 28 in 1950
@entity0 also expected to lose between five and ten seats in the @entity38
