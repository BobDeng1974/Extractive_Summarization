by @entity0 published : 12:50 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 15:33 est , 6 september 2012 @entity2 soldiers who return from wars abroad in @entity4 and @entity5 have a host of difficulties in front of them once they hang up their weapons and put their uniforms in the storage chest			0
but for many veterans , the horrors of war are haunting , and effects of @entity17 are utterly debilitating , and may cause them to age prematurely			2
researchers are seeing alarming patterns in young veterans ’ health , with many otherwise healthy young men developing early - onset diabetes , heart disease , and slow metabolism leading to obesity			1
those with apparent ptsd even have signs of loss of grey matter in the brain , which @entity63 notes should not happen until old age			1
according to the @entity69 , the number of soldiers with ptsd or brain injury has increased exponentially in recent years			1
the government organisation says that since 2000 , more than 240,000 soldiers have reported traumatic brain injury			1
many who have returned from warfare experience vivid flashbacks to horrific moments in combat – the sound of gunfire , explosions , and carnage			0
in the study , fronted by @entity82 , the consortium of @entity17 experts will look at gene data and psychophysiology to evaluate the disorder , as well as using @entity88 to map out images of the brain			1
a sample of 2,953 @entity2 civilians and 345 military veterans was collected			2
troubling signs : researchers in @entity55 have been studying more than 340 veterans to further investigate physical factors of @entity17 , including heart disease and obesity collaboration : scientists and doctors are looking at the negative effects of @entity17 on the brain in many cases , @entity88 images of veterans aged 20 - 30 showed deteriorated brain matter likened to that of a 70 - year - old			1
@entity111 , a psychiatrist and neurobiologist , told @entity63 that traumatic stress , when left untreated , can cause the brain to become fixated on those moments and go back to them too easily			1
as a response to the relentless stress , the body simply ages faster , the researchers hypothesize			0
' no one tells you how to shut it off			0
i spent a lot of time dealing with my demons			0
' - veteran @entity128 @entity128 , a 31 - year - old veteran of the @entity129 , witnessed nightly attacks during his tour to @entity4 in 2004 - 2005			1
he told @entity63 that he has constant flashbacks of mortar attacks and visions of dead bodies , adding that it was difficult to make stop			0
‘ no one tells you how to shut it off , ’ he said			0
‘ i spent a lot of time dealing with my demons			0
’ dr @entity143 , a professor of @entity144 at @entity52 who is the co-director of the @entity145 for @entity146 and stress disorders ( @entity149 ) study based at the @entity150 , told @entity151 in an email that the brains of 150 veterans showed significant signs of stress			2
he wrote : ' the red areas are places where there are statistically consistent correlation 's for a sample of over 150 participants in our study			0
you are looking at the maps on two different sides of the brain			2
' another way of thinking of this is that the figure shows that in the places that are red and yellow the higher the degree of stress the thinner the top layer of cerebral cortex			0
' the statistical map shows that key areas of the 150 veterans ' brains were similarly effected by trauma			2
preliminary data : this is a composite of 150 veterans measuring areas of the brain effected by @entity17 ; in the places that are red and yellow the higher the degree of stress the thinner the top layer of cerebral cortex on the rise : traumatic brain injury , including @entity17 , has risen alarmingly since 2005 more than eight per cent of the population will suffer from ptsd at some point in their lives , according to @entity51 ’s @entity50			1
in addition to military fighters , civilians who have been exposed to traumatic events – such as car accidents – are prone to suffer from the condition			1
when left untreated , @entity17 can lead to panic attacks , depression , substance abuse , weight gain , and heart disease			0
according to @entity82 , more than half of those with the disorder are not properly diagnosed			2
this consortium hopes to find concrete chemical evidence to better diagnose and treat the disorder			1
‘ although some biological characteristics that point to a ptsd diagnosis have already been identified , more comprehensive study is critical to examine the integrated roles of multiple potential biological factors of the condition , ’ dr @entity214 , the director of the @entity215 at @entity216 and professor of psychiatry at @entity52 , said in a statement			1
‘ this will help clinicians develop personalized treatment plans to improve outcomes , rather than relying on one - size - fits - all approaches			0

consortium in @entity55 is studying ptsd in young veterans and those exposed to traumatic brain injury
in veterans no older than 30 , brain imaging sometimes looks like that of a 70 - year - old
*current* diagnosis includes self - reporting , but scientists hope to create concrete biological factors for measuring disorder
