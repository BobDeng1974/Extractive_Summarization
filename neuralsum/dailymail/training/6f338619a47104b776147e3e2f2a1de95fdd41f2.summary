by @entity0 and @entity1 jellyfish stung at least 400 @entity4 beachgoers over the weekend , prompting lifeguards to raise purple flags warning of hazardous marine life off the state 's east coast , authorities said on monday			1
officers said the jellyfish swarm arrived on friday and has remained concentrated around @entity13 , on the @entity15 coast in the north - central part of the state			1
@entity18 , a potential hurricane headed towards the @entity20 after wreaking havoc in the @entity22 , is believed to have pushed the jellyfish closer to shore , according to my @entity25			1
' it could be thousands , ' said @entity30 captain @entity29			0
write caption here ' thousands ' : @entity33 officials believe the swarms of jellyfish were forced closer to shore by winds from the storms in the tropics proceed with caution : lifeguards put up purple flags to warn swimmers of what was in the water , causing many to get out moving fast : by @entity48 evening @entity46 had maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 120 kph ) and was tracking east at 2 mph ( 4 kp )			1
this map shows its expected path this week @entity52 : officials have not said whether the jellyfish problem will continue north as @entity18 tracks the coast ' it 's hard to see them in the water right now			1
all you can see are the ones on shore			0
' no one was seriously injured , @entity29 said			0
lifeguards treated most of the victims with a splash of vinegar , which quickly halts the burning pain of the sting			2
jellyfish stings can be dangerous or fatal in rare cases in which the victim is severely allergic to the venom			2
@entity29 said the size of the swarm and number of people stung are not unusual , adding that it is hard for beachgoers to predict when the jellyfish will wash towards shore			2

they can appear in various colors but typically surface with a translucent milky color on central @entity4 beaches			2
smart : some clever beachgoers decided the best way to deal with the jellyfish was to put their chairs in the shallows high winds : twenty five mph winds from the @entity104 and rough surf hit the @entity106 in @entity4 on monday as a result of @entity18 traveling up the coast local lifeguards stock vinegar , which can deactivate the stingers , as can salt water			1
fresh or tap water can reactivate them			0
stung beachgoers can also find relief by submerging their wounds in hot water			0
a storm front on monday churned up the surf , which was calm over the weekend , but so far has not washed the jellyfish out to sea , officials said			0
officials expect conditions to become rougher as @entity18 passes offshore , east of @entity4 , and tracks north along the @entity15			1
