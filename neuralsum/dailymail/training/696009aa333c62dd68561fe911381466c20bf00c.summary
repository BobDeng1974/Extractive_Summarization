by @entity0 a grandmother has been left with a disfigured nose after doctors failed to notice she had a tumour the size of turnip growing on her nose - and nicknamed her ‘ @entity7 ’			1
@entity8 , 79 , now has a hole in the centre of her face after a series of life - saving operations to remove a cancerous growth from the end of her nose			1
the problem developed when she was in hospital and over nearly five months a scab repeatedly formed on the tip of her nose before falling off			1
@entity8 developed a large tumour on her nose ( left ) but it took doctors so long to diagnose it as skin cancer she eventually had to have a life - saving operation which saw surgeons remove most of her nose ( right ) doctors initially dismissed the growth as a reaction to the medication she was given after breaking her leg			1
but each time it came back the sore got bigger and nurses jokingly nicknamed her ‘ @entity7 ’			2
mrs @entity8 , a retired bus conductor who does not want to name the hospital for legal reasons , said : ‘ i understand they butchered my face to save my life , and i ’m very grateful			1
‘ but during the time the tumour was growing on my face , i saw dozens of doctors and nurses - many of whom commented about it but did not even bother doing any tests			2
‘ when i was finally diagnosed with skin cancer , it was way too late			1
‘ the tumour was so big it had spread to my lip and i had to have two operations to remove it			0
mrs @entity8 ( pictured before developing the tumour ) went into hospital with a broken leg and while she was there she developed a growth on her nose			1
doctors dismissed it as a reaction to her medication the growth grew so large that staff at the unnamed hospital nicknamed mrs @entity64 ‘ by the end it was the size of a turnip			1
if they ’d caught it sooner , i might be able to still smell the flowers in my garden			0
‘ now i ’ve been left with a gaping hole in the middle of my face - i look like i ’ve been shot			0
’ mrs @entity8 ’s ordeal began in july 2011 when she fell over in the garden of her home in @entity78 , and broke her femur and shattered her kneecap			2
she was hospitalised for 15 weeks after her leg failed to heal and she underwent surgery to repair her damaged knee			2
midway through her stay she mysteriously began developing a scab on the tip of her nose			2
the widow said : ‘ it would appear on a monday , scab up through the week and then fall off on its own by the friday			0
mrs @entity8 was eventually diagnosed with malignant melanoma and was told she needed surgery			1
image ( right ) shows the scab on her nose with stitches after an operation mrs @entity8 ( pictured with her daughter , @entity8 , and granddaughter , @entity100 ) now has a large hole in her nose			1
she was given a prosthetic but she does n't wear it as it is uncomfortable ‘ it was the strangest thing			1
the nurses and doctors said it was just a reaction to the medication i was on for my break , so i did n’t think anything of it			1
‘ i mean , you do n’t , do you ? you trust doctors to get it right and know when something is wrong			0
’ but just before she went in for her knee operation , in september 2011 , the scab started to get bigger and refused to fall off			0
her daughter @entity117 , 54 , of @entity118 , @entity119 , said : ‘ the nurses used to call her “ @entity7 ”			0
‘ it was almost their pet name for her			0
‘ my mum hated it but she would n’t say anything about it , because that ’s the type of lady she is			0
she ’d never make a fuss			0
@entity100 ( pictured with her mother , @entity8 ) said her grandmother was n't the same person any more			1
she said : ' my nan has been knocked for six by all this			0
they 've given her a prosthetic nose but she 's self - conscious about it because her face is a complete mess			1
' ‘ it was like she was growing a horn			0
‘ when she was recovering after her knee op , the lump just kept getting bigger and bigger			0
‘ and then when she was discharged it was still growing			0
‘ all the doctors and nurses we spoke to said it was just a cyst or a reaction to her meds , so they did n’t think it was anything to worry about			2
’ it was only when mrs @entity8 saw a locum in december while staying with her daughter - around five months after the curious growth began - that she was told it could be more serious			1
the doctor referred her to a different hospital where she had a biopsy and was told she had a malignant melanoma in her nose and on her lip			2
mrs @entity8 ( pictured during treatment on her nose ) is considering taking legal action against the hospital over the course of two operations , surgeons at an @entity119 hospital removed almost all of her nose , as well as a portion of her upper lip , and a slice of skin from her neck for skin grafts which did not take			1
she has also been fitted with a prosthetic nose , which she is reluctant to wear because it ’s uncomfortable			1
mrs @entity8 and her family are considering suing the hospital in @entity78 - which they do not want to name for legal reasons - for negligence , claiming it had ample opportunity to spot the tumour			1
granddaughter @entity185 , 18 , said her grandmother was n’t the same person any more			0
she said : ‘ my nan has been knocked for six by all this			0
‘ they ’ve given her a prosthetic nose but she ’s self - conscious about it because her face is a complete mess			2
‘ it looks like she was shot in the face			0
‘ i love her with all the world but i think the @entity199 has really let her down			0
’ melanoma is a rare and serious type of cancer that begins in the skin and can spread to other parts of the @entity207 most common sign of melanoma is the appearance of a new mole or a change in an existing @entity213 moles are most often found on the back , legs , arms and @entity217 most cases , the moles have an irregular shape and more than one colour			2
they may also be larger than normal and are sometimes itchy and @entity222 is one of the most common cancers in people aged 15 to 34.more than 2,000 people die of the disease every year in the @entity228 and it is becoming more @entity229 : @entity230			0
