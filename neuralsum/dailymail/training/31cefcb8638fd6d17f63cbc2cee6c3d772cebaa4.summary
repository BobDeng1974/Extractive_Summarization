the dreaded magpie swooping season is apon us , as the weather starts to warm up			1
whether on a bike going for a ride , or walking your dog , magpies are looking for their next victim to attack , becoming increasingly aggressive during breeding season which lasts until october			1
but what are the best ways to stop magpies from swooping ? breakfast announcer from @entity14 's 99.5 , @entity15 tested out two theories and documented them on youtube , and it 's definite to say one worked while the other miserably failed			1
they become aggressive protecting their nest for both test runs , @entity15 decided to get on her bike and ride down a magpie prone road , where she was knew she would encounter some fierce feathered behaviour			2
for test one it was the branches stuck in a helmet , strategy			0
a pretty scared @entity15 and was n't sure if this would work , but was keen to try , and when she did was pleasantly surprised with the result			0
the angry bird flew down very close to @entity15 but it appears not to swoop and feeling very relieved she comes out of her test run relatively unscathed			1
but test two , fake eyes on the back of the head trick , did n't go so smoothly			1
it 's quite a fierce magpie			0
' from all reports it 's not very nice so hopefully the eyes are going to work , i do have a helmet on so should n't hurt too much			2
' but she was so wrong ! the magpie swooped and went on the attack , it hit her helmet causing @entity15 to start to panic			2
test two : what @entity15 does n't know is that this magpie will go straight for her , failing miserably got you ! the magpie goes straight for @entity15 's helmet			1
magpies are more aggressive and swoop people in breeding season between august and late october rider and walkers beware ! : we are in the middle of magpie swooping season which lasts between august and late october as the bird get overprotective of their nests test one : it has worked			1
the magpie has stayed at a distance the branches on the head trick has worked and kept the magpie at a safe distance ' ahhhhh , ahhhhhh , the eyes do n't work , they eyes do n't work , ' she screamed			2
' ahhhh the eyes do n't work			0
they do n't work , they do n't work			0
get it off , get it off			0
' the attack lasted for more than thirty seconds and @entity15 was frantic			0
' is it gone , is it gone , it 's not gone			0
get it off , ahhhhhh , get mum , get mum , oh my god is it gone , ' there was no doubt her magpie swooping theories had a clear result and her findings , one worked and one definitely did not work			1
the youtube clip also wrote , ' in case you missed @entity15 's results , the eyes do n't work , the eyes do n't work , the eyes do n't work , the eyes do n't work			2
get mum , get mum , the eyes do n't work '			0
amber who claims she loves animals and always wanted to be a vet , documented the magpie theories for her breakfast show on @entity15 and @entity125 's @entity14 weekdays program			1
a small percentage of magpies become highly aggressive during breeding season from late august to early october , and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby			1
mostly male birds are generally known to attack pedestrians at around 50 m from their nest , and cyclists at around 100 m. attacks begin as the eggs hatch , increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow , and tail off as the chicks leave the nest			0
watch out : magpies are on the lookout for vulnerable walkers and bike riders , with swooping season in full swing			0

two magpie swooping theories tested by @entity14 's @entity15
one theory worked and one failed miserably
test one , branches in the helmet seemed to keep the angry bird at *bay*
test two , fake eyes on the back of the helmet , failed and did n't stop the magpie from attacking @entity15
magpies are known the get aggressive during breeding season from august until late october
