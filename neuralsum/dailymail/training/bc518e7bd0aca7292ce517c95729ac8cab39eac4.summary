by @entity0 virtual : cash is being used less and less and banks keep developing new , easy ways of using debit cards cash is being killed off by the banks as they push customers to switch to cards , automated payments and a new service which is linked to mobile phone numbers			1
notes and coins now account for only £ 17.99 of every £ 100 spent , down by £ 3.03 on a year ago , according to the @entity13			1
the banks are keen to push for the demise of cash and cheques because these are much more expensive for them to transport , handle , count and process than electronic payments			1
from today they will also put further pressure on cash with the launch of a service that allows quick electronic payments to be made using mobile phone numbers linked to current accounts			1
called @entity26 , it is backed by all the high street banks and initially will be available to 30million people before being extended to nine out of ten accounts by the end of the year			1
however , virtual money is not universally welcomed by customers , because many do not trust banks to ensure the electronic payments system is reliable and secure			1
there have been a number of instances in recent years of customers being locked out of their bank accounts and blocked from using cards at tills by serious bank it failures			1
banks and stores have also made it increasingly difficult for customers to use cheques , banning them from many petrol stations and supermarkets , while energy firms impose charges on those who pay using cheques			1
in time , this pattern is likely to be repeated for cash			1
however , the @entity13 director of personal current accounts , @entity56 , insisted such change is being led by customers rather than the industry			1
‘ cash continues to decline as more customers prefer the convenience of paying on plastic and automated payments , ’ he said			1
convenient ? @entity13 claims the gradual move away from cash is driven by customers favouring convenience the @entity13 figures show debit cards account for £ 28.87 in every £ 100 of spending , direct debits for £ 19.90 , cash for £ 17.99 , so - called ‘ faster payments ’ , which covers internet and smartphone transactions , for £ 12.81 , cheques £ 11.28 , standing orders £ 7.82 and other bill payments at £ 1.34			1
the @entity26 service – pronounced ‘ pay em ’ – has been described as the first industry - wide collaboration in the @entity83 which could potentially link up every bank account with a mobile number			0
it will allow cash to be transferred on a mobile by using the recipient ’s phone number rather than a bank account number and sort code			2
the system will be integrated into customers ’ existing mobile banking apps			2
generally , users will be able to transfer up to £ 250 a day			0
those who want to receive money will need to register their mobile number with a current account			2
the @entity99 , which is overseeing the initiative , said : ‘ paying someone back just got easier for millions of people			0
’ however , research by @entity104 shows half the population – 47 per cent – have no intention of using it			0
the majority of these – 71 per cent – had concerns about security , while 39 per cent were worried what would happen if their phone were stolen and 32 per cent had fears about paying the wrong person			0
@entity116 of @entity104 said : ‘ it ’s clear the banking industry has a job to do to educate customers that mobile payments are a safe and consumer - friendly development			2
’ @entity124 already operates a mobile phone payments service called ‘ @entity126 ’			0
another scheme , called @entity128 , is set for launch this autumn , while @entity131 , the internet payment specialist owned by @entity133 , has its own system			0
initially , @entity26 can be used by @entity13 , @entity135 , @entity124 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and @entity142 customers			1
a voluntary industry code will help people who accidentally send money to the wrong account to get it back , but there is no guarantee of a refund			2
if you 're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching , there are plenty of incentives to @entity156 is @entity159 's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are			0
top deals include @entity13 's @entity163 promising new customers £ 100 to switch and £ 5 per month if they stay in credit			1
@entity166 pays £ 100 to new customers who switch to its @entity167			2
on top of that , the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a further £ 100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 months			0
the co-op , too , has introduced a £ 100 cash incentive for new customers			1
it will also donate £ 25 to charity on your behalf			0
if you switch your main current account to one of the @entity183 ’s @entity182 current accounts the bank will give you a £ 100 gift card			2
@entity186 is tempting desperate savers with its @entity135 current account - offering up to 4 per cent for balances between £ 4,000 and £ 5,000			0
but you will have to pay in at least £ 1,500			0
tsb has also recently launched an interest - paying , the @entity190 pays 5 per cent on balances of up to £ 2,000 and only requires a minimum monthly deposit of £ 500			0
@entity137 's 123 current account , on the other hand , pays interest on in - credit balances - 1 per cent on balances between £ 1,000 and £ 2,000 , 2 per cent between £ 2,000 and £ 3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £ 3,000 and £ 20,000			0
@entity200 offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £ 2,500 for the first year , while its @entity203 delivers free travel insurance			0
it also operates a @entity205 , whereby both parties will receive £ 50 if an existing customers successfully recommends friends or family to the bank			0

banks encourage card use as cash is expensive to transport and count
some customers still do not trust banks to keep virtual money secure
but @entity13 insists gradual move from cash is preferred for convenience
