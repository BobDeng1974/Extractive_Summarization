when the vein becomes blocked , the coagulated blood may extend to veins draining the area , which could lead to a lack of oxygen and tissue death			0
for @entity16 , ' the particular vein they 're talking about , there are enough other areas for the blood to travel through so it does n't build up in the brain , ' dr @entity74 told @entity82			1
the condition can be treated with blood thinners administered over several months until the clot breaks down			1
@entity16 , 65 , was admitted to the hospital on sunday and @entity87 @entity8 reports that doctors want to monitor her for at least another 48 hours			1

' from dr @entity56 , @entity152			0
@entity153 , and dr @entity57 , @entity154 the new health scare may bring back some painful memories for the former first lady , who suffered a large blood clot in her leg back in 1998			2
in a 2007 interview with the @entity97 , @entity16 called the 1998 clot ' the most significant health scare i 've ever had			2
' most clots in the legs are treated with six months of blood thinners to allow them to dissolve on their own and to prevent further clots from forming , he said			2
a clot in a lung or the brain is more serious			1
lung clots , called pulmonary embolisms , can be deadly , and a clot in the brain can cause a stroke			1
@entity16 's illness led her to cancel an overseas trip and scheduled testimony before @entity181 about the attack on the @entity184 @entity183 in @entity185 , @entity186			0
when her absence was reported , several pundits and newspapers accused @entity16 of making her illness seem worse than it was to dodge questions from lawmakers over the consulate attack , which claimed the lives of four @entity184 , including ambassador @entity196			0
the @entity197 called her concussion a ' head fake			2
' @entity201 @entity200 said @entity16 had a case of the ' @entity185 flu , ' while @entity206 contributer @entity204 dubbed it an ' acute @entity185 allergy			0
' @entity208 said doctors will continue to assess @entity16 's condition , ' including other issues associated with her concussion			1
' first family : mrs @entity7 is pictured with daughter @entity7 and husband @entity16 during the closing @entity214 session of the seventh @entity215 of the @entity216 last year earlier this week , @entity217 reported that brain cancer was behind mrs @entity7 's health problems and that she was facing a barrage of medical tests to confirm the diagnosis			1
but a spokesman for the @entity224 labelled the claims ' absolute nonsense ' and insisted @entity16 was recovering well from the fall and subsequent concussion			2

@entity9 has a blood clot located in the vein in the space between the brain and the skull behind the right ear , a condition called transverse sinus venous thrombosis			1
the transverse sinus is located beneath the brain and allows blood to drain from the back of the head			2
it is the most common sites for clots inside the head , according to the @entity248			0
a clot occurs when a blockage builds up , either from partial thrombus ( coagulated blood ) or an outside compression			2
when the vein becomes blocked , the coagulated blood may extend to veins draining the area , which could lead to a lack of oxygen and tissue death			0
for @entity16 , ' the particular vein they 're talking about , there are enough other areas for the blood to travel through so it does n't build up in the brain , ' dr @entity74 told @entity82			0
symptoms and signs can include headache , nausea , vomiting and seizures , although the condition was detected in @entity16 with a routine mri scan following her treatment for concussion			0
doctors questioned whether this concussion , paired with the fact @entity9 had a similar clot in her leg in 1988 , led to the condition			1
' you do n't typically see blood clots forming in veins after this sort of concussion , ' dr @entity74 said			0
' she is somebody who has formed these blood clots before			0
there are some people who more likely develop blood clots			0
does she clot more vigorously than normal ? that with the brain injury - the concussion - could have led to it			1
' the condition can be treated with blood thinners administered over several months until the clot breaks down			1
other treatments include using a shunt to drain pressure on the brain or surgery - yet doctors said neither are necessary for @entity16			1
' the most concerning thing was ... the fact that this could be a blood clot pushing on her brain , ' dr @entity74 said			1
' that 's not what this is			0
you would n't treat something like that with blood thinners			0
it 's not a mass or a collection of blood pushing on the brain but it is something you 'd want to address fairly quickly			0
' detractors have claimed @entity16 's advancing age and health make her too old to realistically serve as a two - term president were she elected in 2016			0
' i am , thankfully , knock on wood , not only healthy , but have incredible stamina and energy , ' @entity16 told @entity231			0

she told reporters at the press conference that ' it would be a good idea to find out how tired i really am			0
' ' stamina : ' at 65 years old , @entity16 bragged to @entity231 just days before fainting that she is healthy and has plenty of energy and stamina			0

secretary of state hospitalized at @entity8 after follow - up exam found the clot
