a partnership that had helped fashion @entity2 sporting history came to an end on a chilly november day at @entity6 ’s house in @entity7			1
@entity8 had gone for a chat with the friend he met as a young teenager at @entity13 tennis academy and whom he assisted to the @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 titles			1
five years of living out of each other ’s pockets was over			2
‘ we sat and talked for a few hours and that was it , a calm conversation , ’ said @entity8 , speaking for the first time about his exit from @entity24 following the @entity25			1
@entity6 looks to the sky as he books his place in the last 32 of the @entity32 on wednesday @entity6 celebrates his 2012 @entity15 win with @entity8 , @entity33 ( second right ) and @entity35 ( right ) ‘ our professional relationship had run its course			1
maybe it had become a bit stale			2
i thought it was the right time to part			2
there are no hard feelings but now i have to focus on my career , trying to help @entity42 achieve his goals			1
’ @entity45 ’s new charge , the world no 7 , was in @entity32 action against @entity49 ’s @entity48 , while @entity6 faced @entity50 of @entity51			1
‘ @entity6 and i have been friends for nearly 15 years , ’ continued @entity8			1
‘ our personal relationship is still good , i consider him one of my best friends and i ’ll always be in his corner , except for when i am coaching against him			2
’ @entity8 , part of a hugely successful coaching duo with @entity58 , scotches suggestions he and @entity6 had a big fall - out and that he did not get on with @entity61			1
he predicts the @entity62 will win more @entity63			1
if there is a source of contention it is @entity6 ’s pointed , recently repeated assertions that his team were not all ‘ pulling in the same direction ’ in the last few months			1
there certainly seem to have been technical disagreements about the type of fitness regimes favoured by trainer @entity33 , who also left in november , but it is news to @entity77 that there was a split in the camp			1
@entity8 had been part of @entity6 's team for over a decade after they met as juniors in @entity13 ‘ we were all pulling in the same direction , ’ he says			1
‘ i ’m quite proud of how we pulled it around after the @entity15			0
it was pretty hard , him qualifying for @entity90 from his position after @entity92			0
of course @entity6 is the one who played the matches but everyone had the goal of helping him get there			1
i do n’t think the last four months are a reason we are n’t working together any more , it was genuinely mutual			0
‘ his determination , professionalism and stubbornness , that ’s what has made him so successful but , because of the way he is , it gets to the point when it is time for both parties to go their own ways			0
’ few know @entity6 better than @entity8 , a soft - spoken @entity108 who smilingly describes himself as ‘ 28 , but with an old soul ’			1
he worked with @entity24 from early 2010 , travelling non-stop and becoming the perfect foil for the uncompromising @entity58 , who rarely wasted a chance to extol the @entity114 ’s understated contribution			0
there was undoubtedly some hurt when @entity6 sought @entity61 ’s services at the @entity118 without telling his inner circle first , but @entity45 flattens widely - held assertions that he could not work with her			1
‘ we had a great relationship and i learned a great deal from her , ’ he says			0
‘ she went through a lot as a player and it ’s great to spend any time with legends of the game			0
it will only make me a better coach			0
i think she is going to be very good for @entity6 , they have the same ideas about how to move forward and win @entity63			1
’ @entity45 has taken over coaching @entity136 7 @entity42 , with the @entity138 playing at the @entity32 @entity6 , at the 2014 @entity139 , split with @entity8 ( right ) from his coaching staff in november @entity45 ’s standing in @entity58 ’s eyes was such that when @entity42 approached his compatriot about coaching — and @entity58 declined due to the family and wider commitments that caused him to leave @entity24 last march — he was quick to recommend the @entity108			1
‘ @entity58 was a great mentor			0
@entity146 and outside of the court he is a great person and taught me a lot , ’ said @entity8			2
relationships between coaches and players are intense enough in tennis , even without a deep friendship mixed in			0
@entity8 acknowledges it has been ‘ a bit weird ’ being here in an opposite camp to @entity6			1
‘ it was always going to be strange			0
the first day i got here he was hitting on the @entity160 with @entity161 and i gave him a big hug and said hello			0
i am close friends with the rest of the team , they will be friends for the rest of my life			2
‘ @entity6 and i have n’t spent much time together in the last few months and that ’s very unusual			2
the more time we spend together like this the more normal it will become			0
@entity6 , practising ahead of his third round clash in @entity173 , with his coach @entity61 ‘ i ’ll always be extremely grateful for the opportunity he gave me and the trust he put in me			1
we achieved some great things together			0
there were rough patches too , but most were good			0
‘ the team was all pulling together , there were no egos			2
it was always all about @entity6 , how we can make him better and achieve his goals			2
we tried to make him the best he could be			0
‘ the most joy for me was his @entity16 win and seeing him presented with the gold medal			0
it was very special because it was in his own country on @entity190 against @entity191			0
‘ i feel it was a big moment for him to define his career			0
getting over that hurdle i really think helped him win the @entity15 and @entity18			0
it added self - belief			2
‘ i think @entity6 will win @entity63 again , he still has the hunger and he is a special talent and competitor			2
’ @entity8 ’s task now is to coax a first major out of @entity42 , who came closest when he reached the wimbledon 2010 final			1
‘ i was going to take a bit of time out but it ’s a great opportunity and the first few weeks have been good , ’ he says			0
‘ @entity209 is a good guy with a lot of talent who works hard			0
’ @entity45 at @entity18 ( left ) with @entity58 and @entity33 , who have all departed @entity6 's set up @entity6 looked in complete control as he beat @entity173 @entity216 in straight sets on wednesday			1

@entity8 left @entity6 's coaching team last november
@entity45 has begun coaching @entity136 7 @entity42
the @entity62 faces @entity50 in the third round of the @entity32
@entity6 beat @entity173 @entity216 6 - 1 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 2 on wednesday
