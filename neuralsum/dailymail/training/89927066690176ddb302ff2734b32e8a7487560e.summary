the 64 - year - old @entity7 laureate in physics came under fire for his handling of a $ 528 million federal loan to solar panel manufacturer @entity12 during his tenure , after the company collapsed in 2011 and 1,100 workers lost their jobs			1
but he will also be remembered for accomplishments including helping to plug a massive @entity20 oil spill in the @entity21			1
@entity2 offered his resignation to president @entity4 in a letter on friday			0
he said he will stay on at least until the end of february and may stay until a successor is confirmed			0
@entity2 's decision to step down had been widely expected and follows announcements by interior secretary @entity29 , @entity31 chief @entity30 and @entity32 , head of the @entity33 , that they are leaving			0
the @entity35 said no decisions have been made on replacements for any of the environment and energy jobs but said @entity4 's priorities will remain unchanged			0
potential replacements for @entity2 include former @entity43 sen. @entity42 , former @entity45 gov. @entity44 and former @entity47 gov. @entity46			1
@entity4 said in a statement on friday that @entity2 brought a ' unique understanding of both the urgent challenge presented by climate change and the tremendous opportunity that clean energy represents for our economy			2
' during his tenure , @entity2 helped move the country toward energy independence , @entity4 said , citing @entity60 programs to boost renewable energy such as wind and solar power			2
' thanks to @entity66 , we also expanded support for our brightest engineers and entrepreneurs as they pursue groundbreaking innovations that could transform our energy future , ' @entity4 said			0
@entity2 , a former director of the @entity72 , had little political experience before taking the energy post in 2009			2
praise : president @entity4 , pictured center , praised @entity2 , right , for his achievements in the post he drew fire from congressional republicans who criticized his handling of a $ 528 million federal loan to solar panel maker @entity12 , which later went bankrupt , laying off its 1,100 workers			1
republicans said @entity2 and other @entity60 officials missed many warning signs about problems at @entity12 and compounded them by approving a restructuring of the loan even after problems were discovered			2
@entity12 was the first renewable - energy company to receive a loan guarantee under the 2009 stimulus law , and the @entity4 administration frequently promoted the company as a model for its clean energy program			1
@entity2 attended a 2009 groundbreaking when the loan was announced , and @entity4 visited the company 's @entity103 , @entity104 , headquarters the next year			1
the company 's implosion in 2011 and revelations that the administration hurried a review of the loan in time for the groundbreaking became an embarrassment for @entity2 and @entity4 and a rallying cry for @entity115 critics of the administration 's green energy program			1
under fire : the 64 - year - old @entity7 laureate in physics , pictured , came under fire for his handling of a $ 528 million federal loan to @entity12 lawmakers also criticized @entity2 for approving the plan to restructure @entity12 's debt so that two private investors moved ahead of taxpayers for repayment in case of default			1
@entity2 defended the @entity12 loan during a sometimes testy hearing in late 2011			1
while calling the ultimate outcome ' regrettable , ' @entity2 said the loan was subject to ' proper , rigorous scrutiny and healthy debate ' before it was approved in 2009			0
' while we are disappointed in the outcome of this particular loan , we support @entity141 ' mandate to finance the deployment of innovative technologies and believe that our portfolio of loans does so responsibly , ' @entity2 said			2
the @entity35 said @entity2 retained @entity4 's confidence , but @entity2 was widely expected to leave following @entity4 's re-election last fall			0
in a letter to @entity60 employees , @entity2 said he was proud of his tenure and cited dozens of accomplishments , including doubling the production of renewable energy from wind and solar power			1
installations of small solar electric , or photovoltaic , systems have nearly doubled in each of the last three years , he said , while 42 per cent of new energy capacity in the @entity161 last year was from wind â€” more than any other energy source , @entity2 said			2
embarrassing : @entity12 's implosion in 2011 and revelations that the administration hurried a review of the loan in time for the groundbreaking became an embarrassment for @entity2 and @entity4 ' i came with dreams and am leaving with a set of accomplishments that we should all be proud of , ' he said			1
one of his accomplishments was something that @entity2 rarely talked about : @entity4 repeatedly credits @entity2 with helping to plug the massive @entity20 oil spill in the @entity21			1
@entity2 and a team of engineers helped devised an interim solution before a replacement well permanently plugged the leak , which spewed more than 200 million gallons of oil in the worst offshore oil disaster in the country 's history			0
when @entity2 resigned , he singled out for praise @entity46 , hinting she may be a possibility for the @entity4 administration 's energy and climate team			2
@entity2 lauded @entity192 , a @entity193 who served as governor of @entity47 from 2005 until mid-january and is long - time backer of president @entity4			1
possible successor : @entity2 heaped praise on @entity46 , pictured , hinting she may be a possibility for the @entity4 administration 's energy and climate team ' i am especially appreciative of governor @entity192 for her trust and support over the past six months , ' @entity2 said in a lengthy resignation letter on friday			1
@entity2 worked with @entity192 on the clean - up of the @entity207 in @entity47 , one of the @entity161 nuclear weapons development facilities			2
working on the nuclear waste issue with @entity192 and others has taken about five to 10 hours per week of his time over the last six months , @entity2 said in the letter			0
@entity192 , 65 , has worked on nuclear waste issues for decades			0
as a deputy state attorney general in the mid 1980s , @entity192 lobbied the federal government to disclose any health risks from contamination at @entity207			0
sources close to @entity192 say she has been vetted by the @entity35 as a possible choice for a number of posts , including energy secretary , interior secretary and @entity31 administrator			0
@entity192 was an early supporter of @entity4 in his first @entity35 race , and in doing so broke with @entity47 's @entity161 senators , @entity229 and @entity230 , who supported @entity231			0
in his letter , @entity2 said the @entity60 made ' historic progress ' in cleaning nuclear contamination left from @entity236 weapons development			0
' despite this progress , the environmental clean - up projects still have considerable technical and project management challenges , ' he added			0
millions of gallons of toxic radioactive waste are stored in underground tanks at @entity207 , a possible threat to the nearby @entity244 , which runs between @entity245 and @entity47			0
security at the government 's nuclear facilities would also fall to @entity192 if she became energy secretary			0
during @entity2 's tenure , the @entity60 suffered an embarrassment when an 82 - year - old nun and two peace activists broke into the government 's maximum security facility for weapons grade uranium in @entity258 , @entity259 .			1
