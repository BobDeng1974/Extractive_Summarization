@entity0 say @entity2 blast not to blame no increase reported in @entity4 despite changes in @entity6 very low levels of radioactive iodine - 131 have been detected throughout @entity6 , but the particles are not believed to pose a public health risk , the @entity8 agency said on friday			1
@entity13 have released images of 2,400 stars , known as the @entity16 , that are producing intense radiation and powerful winds , believed to be the cause for the detection in the atmosphere closer look : known as the @entity16 , these stars have produced intense radiation say @entity13 outbreak : unusual levels of iodine - 131 have been detected in the @entity28 and northern @entity29 the @entity0 ( @entity0 ) , the @entity30 - based @entity8 watchdog , said it did not believe the radioactive particles were from @entity33 's stricken @entity2 nuclear power plant after its emergency in march			1
professor @entity35 , director of medical physics at @entity4 's @entity37 , said any link with @entity2 was extremely unlikely			1
' it is far more likely that the iodine may be as a result of excretion by patients undergoing medical treatment			0
' whilst such patients are carefully controlled , some release of iodine into the environment may be inevitable but would certainly be well below any limits where health detriment would even begin to be an issue for concern , " he said			0
blameless : the @entity2 explosion is not believed to be the root cause for the increase in iodine - 131 levels the @entity28 's nuclear security watchdog said it had tipped off the @entity0 after detecting the radiation it thought was coming from abroad but not from a nuclear power plant			1
it suggested it may come from production of radiopharmaceuticals			0
@entity29 's @entity65 said slightly higher levels of radioactive iodine had been measured in the north of the country , ruling out that it came from a nuclear power plant			0
@entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 also reported traces at very low levels that did not pose a health risk			2
experts said the origin of the radiation - which has been spreading for about two weeks - remained a mystery but could come from many possible sources ranging from medical laboratories or hospitals to nuclear submarines			0
@entity86 , linked to cancer if found in high doses , can contaminate products such as milk and vegetables			0
@entity92 , a professor of nuclear physics at @entity4 's @entity94 , said the suggestion that it may have leaked from a radiopharmaceuticals maker ' sounds very sensible and totally reasonable			1
' he said since iodine was used in the treatment of thyroid conditions it was also likely that hospitals in many @entity6 countries would have it in their stores			1
' it would be very unlikely for it to have come from @entity2 since the accident was so many months ago and @entity86 has a brief half - life , ' he said			1
@entity86 is a short - lived radioisotope that has a radioactive decay half - life of about eight days , the @entity0 said			2
@entity113 , head of the nuclear fission unit of @entity117 's national alternative energy body @entity115 said any number of sources could be to blame for the readings			2
' it could be coming from the transporting of ( nuclear ) material , it could come from a hospital ... it could even come from a nuclear submarine , even if it 's a more complicated possibility ... but you ca n't rule that out			0
' officials in @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity4 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 said they had not detected any abnormal radiation levels			2
@entity139 's watchdog said there had been no incident at the country 's sole nuclear plant			0
@entity73 's @entity65 said small levels were measured in the east and north of the @entity147 country , saying the estimated dose level for the population was one 40,000th of the dose of radiation received in a transatlantic flight			0
in the world 's worst nuclear accident since @entity156 in 1986 , an earthquake followed by a massive tsunami overwhelmed the @entity2 plant in @entity33 , causing a reactor meltdown and leakage of radiation , including of iodine			2
in the days and weeks after the accident , tiny amounts of iodine - 131 believed to have come from @entity2 were detected as far away as @entity166 and other parts of @entity6 , as well as in the @entity168 .			1
