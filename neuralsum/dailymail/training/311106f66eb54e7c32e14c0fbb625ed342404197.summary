humans are now spread across all corners of the globe , but what ’s the next step ? according to dr @entity6 , a @entity8 contractor and space settlement expert , he says the next logical move is to colonise @entity12 orbit			1
and , he says barring any major national disasters , we could soon have huge habitats floating around the planet by the end of the century			1
dr @entity6 , a contractor for the @entity19 in @entity20 , says humanity could soon begin to build space settlements			1
a space settlement ( artist 's illustration ) would be a large structure like a town or city that would house hundreds or thousands of people dr @entity6 is a contract scientist at @entity19 research centre and over the years has worked on the @entity34 , the @entity35 , the @entity36 and much more			1
but a few decades ago his interest was piqued by the possibility of space settlements , leading to him setting up @entity8 's annual @entity40 , which challenges students to come up with designs for space colonies			2
now he ’s a major proponent for living in space , and believes that it wo n’t be long before people are visiting cities in @entity12 orbit as readily as they travel from @entity49 to @entity50			1
a space settlement would be a large structure , comparable in size to a town or small city , built in @entity12 orbit			1
it would have similar amenities and services to towns and cities on @entity12 , and would enable people to live in space			2
the @entity35 currently houses six astronauts at a time , but a space settlement would have hundreds or thousands of people on board			1
future space settlements may also have artificial gravity by rotating around an axis			1
‘ @entity70 [ space settlements ] will happen or not is really hard to say			2
whether it can happen , absolutely , ’ dr @entity6 tells @entity69			1
‘ if we as a people decide to do it , we can do it			0
we have the scientific capability , financial capability , there is simply no question we can do it			0
‘ if no major disaster strikes in the next few centuries , i would be astounded if we did n’t do it			0
’ he explains how our technological know - how it only going to increase barring an enormous catastrophe like a nuclear war			0
‘ we could have the first space settlement in decades , certainly less than a century			2
’ dr @entity6 ( pictured ) is a contract scientist at @entity19 research centre and over the years has worked on the @entity34 , the @entity35 , the @entity36 and much more			1
he now also runs an annual competition called the @entity40 dr @entity6 is a proponent of orbiting colonies , while he adds that others like @entity95 ceo @entity94 are envisaging a future where humans live on @entity98			1
as to the actual purpose of a space settlement dr @entity6 says it could be just like a town or city on @entity12 while also providing a way for humans to expand and survive off @entity12			1
it would be ‘ a place to live , raise your kids , where your friends and family have @entity113 dinner and celebrate @entity114 , and visit @entity12 on vacation , ’ explains dr @entity6			1
‘ it ’s the same purpose as any town or settlement or city has			2
‘ the way species get endangered and wiped out is by being dependent on a limited environment			0
‘ humanity started in @entity123 and now live on literally every continent - even @entity125 - albeit for a small time			0
‘ we live in snow , jungle , deserts , savannahas , forests ; we have spread out about as far as we can spread out , and the next step is to move to space			0
’ @entity95 ceo @entity94 ( left ) has been building and launching rockets with the goal of making access to space easier			0
he hopes that one day humans may be able to colonise @entity98 ( right )			0
dr @entity6 says such a goal is achievable , after perhaps building a colony in @entity12 orbit but what would that first space settlement look like ? many designs rely upon a central cylinder around which is a rotating habitat			1
in the rotating section the force of rotation provides artificial gravity for the inhabitants , letting the move around like they would on @entity12			1
‘ that means your children will grow up with strong muscles , ’ explains dr @entity6 , so even if they spend a prolonged time in space they could still travel to @entity12 and cope with its gravity			1
at the centre of the structure though there would be zero - gravity , as there would be no rotation here			2
this , explains dr @entity6 , could be used for recreation or even to film movies			1
elsewhere on the station would be agriculture , while the outer hull would need to be partially covered in solar cells			0
but what would that first space settlement look like ? many designs rely upon a central cylinder around which is a rotating habitat ( artist 's illustration shown )			2
in the rotating section the force of rotation provides artificial gravity for the inhabitants , letting the move around like they would on @entity12 but dr @entity6 admits that such an undertaking is something that just is n’t financially feasible - for now			1
according to dr @entity6 there are a number of obstacles that must be overcome before humans can live in space			1
the first is that the cost of getting to space via rockets must decrease			0
@entity198 is life support ; a future space colony will need to be almost self - sufficient , using indoor farms and solar energy			0
a colony will also need radiation shielding to protect it from harmful cosmic and solar rays , although recent research says this may not be a big issue			0
‘ if you have to ask [ how much it would cost ] , you ca n’t afford it , ’ he jokes			0
he adds : ‘ there is one circumstance we could easily afford it , and that ’s if the people of @entity12 decided to stop killing each other and spend all that time and money on space settlements			1
’ however starting to build a space settlement now is not a good idea , he says , as technology and infrastructure are not yet sufficient			2
he says we need to progress through several hoops before settling in space can become a viable option			0
one of these is space tourism			0
several private companies such as @entity233 and @entity95 are busy building manned spacecraft , while others like @entity236 are planning to build ‘ space hotels ’ in orbit			2
these orbiting habitats , while much smaller than the large space settlements envisaged by dr @entity6 , would allow people to pay for trips to space			1
dr @entity6 even says these could be used to raise money by hosting what he calls a ‘ @entity248 ’ in orbit			1
by sending the world ’s top athletes to space and having the compete , people would tune in to watch them compete in a variety of micro-gravity sports			0
‘ you could get @entity255 , a soccer star , a basketball star and so on , ’ he says			0
‘ it would be a level playing field because no one knows how to do sports in microgravity			0
so that would totally be entertaining			0
’ dr @entity6 says we need to progress through several hoops before settling in space can really be a viable option			1
one of these is space tourism			0
several private companies such as @entity233 and @entity95 are busy building manned spacecraft , while others like @entity236 are planning to build ‘ space hotels ’ ( concepts shown ) the timeline for all this is of course up for debate , but dr @entity6 is confident it will happen sooner or later			1
‘ in two or three decades we might have a couple of small hotels [ in orbit ] , and people moving in on a regular basis , ’ he says			0
‘ then at some point somebody will notice if you are old and infirm you might like to live on a space hotel , because you would n’t be subjected to a @entity287 hotel and you would n’t need a walker or wheelchair			0
‘ i can foresee someone building a retirement home in low gravity ; after a couple of years you wo n’t be able to come back , but if you ’re facing 15 years of sitting in a wheelchair you might not want to do that anyway			0
‘ and once that step is done , people living in space permanently , then it ’s not a big step to build a space settlement in orbit			1
‘ all that is on a time scale measured in decades , or in the worst case centuries			0
’ and living in space does n’t need to stop there			0
once a large , floating colony has been built , dr @entity6 explains that other locations in the solar system can be explored			1
perhaps , using asteroids for additional material , a space settlement could be placed around the @entity314			2
once humans have settled in @entity12 orbit , dr @entity6 says it is not a huge leap to imagine they will want to eventually travel further			1
this could begin with the solar system in a few millennia and , ultimately , expand further into the @entity321 ‘ i can imagine within a few centuries that the first settlement will be co-orbiting an asteroid , ’ says dr @entity6			1
‘ to really settle the solar system will take millennia , maybe longer			2
’ and once that goal has achieved , dr @entity6 says there is not much to stop us expanding into the rest of galaxy			2
‘ imagine you have been living on orbital space settlements for 10,000 years , ’ he says			2
‘ in your settlement there might be 100,000 people or even millions			0
‘ if people decided to go to @entity338 , even thought it may take a century to get there , it does n’t matter , because you ’ve been living in this settlement for thousands of years anyway			2
‘ in terms of living situations , does it really matter if you circle @entity12 or @entity338 ? not really			0

dr @entity6 , a contractor for the @entity19 in @entity20 , says humanity could soon begin to build space settlements
a space settlement would be a large structure like a town or city that would house hundreds or thousands of people
*popular* concepts for them involve large rotating structures
these would have artificial gravity on the parts that are rotating
dr @entity6 tells @entity69 such a structure could feasible be built by the end of the century , if major national disasters are *avoided*
but he explains how a number of key steps need to be achieved first before large orbiting cities can be built
and he envisages that once we have colonised @entity12 orbit , it will not be too long before we explore the solar system and beyond as well
