a heartbroken father told yesterday how his daughter had been given hard drugs by dealers targeting schools			1
in an emotional open letter , he told how the ‘ bright and beautiful ’ gcse pupil started using a cocktail of banned substances including cocaine , ecstasy , methadone and ‘ party drug ’ meow meow			1
the father – identified only as @entity15 to protect his family ’s privacy – warned that @entity19 drugs were widely available to children , and urged schools and police to get tough			1
he said dealers made the drugs ‘ incredibly cheap and available ’ to hook their young customers			0
a father has revealed that his teenage daughter became hooked on cocaine and ecstasy after buying the drugs in the school playground ( file pic posed by a model ) his daughter was given them for free or paid only a few pounds for pills , sometimes without knowing what she was taking			1
she had not only put her health in danger but risked sexual abuse by meeting up with men she did not know			0
the father has sent the open letter to his local council , @entity44 , pleading for action to combat a ‘ serious drug problem ’			1
the man described himself as a single parent to a son and daughter – referred to as @entity51 – who both went to a local secondary			2
‘ two weeks ago i discovered that @entity54 had been taking class a drugs for three to four months , ’ he said			2
‘ how dumb am i not to know ? but do you know the signs as a parent ? ’ the father said he had initially dismissed changes in his daughter ’s behaviour as ‘ teenage moodiness ’			2
he has now written an open letter ( above ) to his local authority , @entity44 , begging them to take the issue more seriously asking if a young person has to die before the problem is addressed but he told the @entity70 : ‘ she came to me and said she had got caught up with a group and started taking cocaine and ecstasy			1
‘ i had noticed she had been a bit off but i thought it was a teenage daughter rebelling against her dad … it just did n’t occur to me and i felt naïve and stupid			2
’ horrified by his daughter ’s revelations , the father said he went to her school and police but officers were ‘ aggressive and threatening ’ when his daughter volunteered information , including the names of alleged dealers			1
he accused authorities of ‘ pretending a problem does n’t exist ’ and warned the situation would get worse if it was not tackled , adding : ‘ does a young person here have to die ? ’ the father said his own investigations had found evidence that illicit drugs were available inside schools and youth clubs			1
the father , only known as @entity15 , has called on @entity100 to do more to tackle drug dealing in its schools he told how he had limited his daughter ’s use of her mobile phone and social media , apparently to stop her falling back into drug use			1
he said he hoped she had stopped before she became hooked			0
the father said his relationship with his daughter had hit ‘ rock bottom ’ over his attempts to protect her from lapsing back into drug abuse , saying : ‘ she hates me now			0
’ but , in the absence of help from authorities , he said he now believed it was up to parents to try to ‘ take control ’ to help their children			0
the despairing father said he could not offer a ‘ simple answer ’ but said the problem of drug use would only get worse if it was ignored			0
@entity44 council refused to comment and said it was a matter for police			0
inspector @entity130 , a neighbourhood police manager for @entity44 , said : ‘ we are working with schools to educate young people about drugs and also to deal firmly with any drugs issues that may arise			0
‘ the supply , production and use of drugs in our communities , and the acquisitive crimes associated with drugs , is a serious matter			0
‘ we will do whatever we can to protect young people by disrupting the system and bringing to justice anyone dealing drugs and profiting from crime			0

@entity150 , only known as @entity15 , noticed his daughter was acting *strangely*
*confronted* her and she *confessed* taking cocaine , ecstasy and @entity155
told him drugs were available to buy at school , parks and youth groups
father is now calling on local authority to take the issue more seriously
