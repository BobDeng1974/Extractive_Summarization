@entity0 have never conceded a goal to @entity2 in three previous meetings but can they possibly extend that sequence to a fourth game ? it is a question @entity7 will be asking himself over and over again in the countdown to kick - off at @entity9 , as not many people will give them a chance of preventing @entity2 's all - stars going on a rampage for 90 minutes			1
all numbers and logic point to @entity18 's men picking off @entity0 at will			2
real arrive on @entity19 on the back of seven consecutive victories , amassing 32 goals in the process			0
in four of those games , they have scored five times and plundered eight against @entity27 on september 20			0
@entity7 is a coach who likes his teams to play with flair and imagination but , on wednesday , he will know the first thing that @entity0 have to be is difficult to beat : they need to play with intensity , relentless energy to take @entity2 out of their comfort zone			1
no passengers can be permitted			0
this , then , would be @entity62 's line - up : ( 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 ) @entity63 ; @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 ; @entity68 , @entity69 ; @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 ; @entity34			2
the big call would be taking @entity30 out of the starting line - up but he has not shown any glimpse of having blistering pace during his time at @entity0 so far			1
he wo n't hang on the shoulders of @entity79 and company or set the tone like @entity82 did			0
@entity34 , meanwhile , has often given the impression that he could be a devastating striker			2
playing him in that role would also give @entity7 the option of dropping him back to help shore up the midfield if @entity2 began to dominate possession			1
captain @entity68 will anchor @entity0 's midfield but the @entity35 must play with plenty of energy @entity34 ( left ) will bring more pace to @entity0 's attack than the out - of - form @entity30 @entity0 have won all three previous meetings with @entity2			1
@entity0 4 - 0 @entity2 ( march 10 , 2009 , @entity49 ) @entity2 0 - 1 @entity0 ( february 25 , 2009 , @entity49 ) @entity0 1 - 0 @entity2 ( may 27 , 1981 , @entity49 final ) @entity95 will be the crucial area , as if @entity97 and @entity98 get on the ball , they will begin supplying the ammunition to @entity101 , @entity38 and @entity102			1
by packing the engine room , with runners and workers , @entity0 have a better chance of disrupting @entity2			1
@entity0 are never better than when they when push their opponents back and press them high up the pitch			0
@entity70 , @entity68 , @entity71 , @entity69 and @entity72 are all capable of executing that game plan but those five also give @entity7 flexibility , allowing him to switch formations when necessary			0
@entity0 will need to stop @entity38 continuing his incredible run of form in front of goal @entity29 ( left ) will miss the game through injury but @entity97 has the potential to be a key player @entity98 , in action for @entity2 against @entity121 , will attempt to pull the strings in @entity2 's midfield more than anything , though , @entity0 need to do the basics right			1
it might seem an obvious thing to say but they have been vulnerable this season to balls lofted into the area â€“ think of the goals they gifted to @entity132 and @entity32			0
should @entity0 be as generous to @entity2 as they have been to others so far , their @entity49 ambitions will be in grave danger			2
it is why @entity7 must find the perfect formula to keep the reigning champions at bay			0
video real ready for tough week - @entity18			0

@entity7 ' side host @entity2 at @entity9 on wednesday
the *visitors* have been *prolific* in front of goal while the @entity35 have struggled defensively this season
@entity0 need to flood the midfield and chase down @entity2 when they have possession of the ball
@entity34 should play up - front instead of @entity30
