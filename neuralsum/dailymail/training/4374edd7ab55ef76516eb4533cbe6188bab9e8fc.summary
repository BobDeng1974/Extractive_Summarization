by @entity0 for @entity1 a @entity3 comedy act has done their own take on the latest @entity7 commercial by throwing some @entity9 hipster wannabes into the mix of a hilarious satirical song			1
local guys , known as @entity13 and @entity14 , who actually call themselves - the @entity12 - have released their own version of the original ad called ‘ @entity17 ’ which is a parody on a mother 's apparent struggle when her son changes from a boy to a man			1
@entity25 ’ , which was released on thursday by the guys who regularly create parodies about stereoptypical @entity9 types , is an amusing song about a son breaking the news to his mother that he is moving out of the nest egg and into a @entity9 apartment with his mate			1
@entity13 takes @entity14 along for moral support and together they let his mother down ‘ gently ’ by telling her that he is a ‘ mahn ’ now because @entity7 has made his beard grow quicker , his chest hair thicker and his triceps bigger			1
the guys explain that he is ready for manhood now that he can pack his own lunch and tie his own knots – not to mention that he ’s ‘ got a cool leather wallet and @entity66 made watch ’			2
a quick headbanging session ensues after they declare ' i 've even got my own @entity69 card'and he 's had to ' use it twice because we party so hard			0
' @entity14 then announces to @entity13 's mother while knocking over a photo frame of the two of them : ' sorry but @entity13 does n’t need you anymore			0
he 's moving in with me so sorry about that dot com , ' as they start to pack up his belongings			0
' @entity59 hes an independent self - sufficient mahn , ' @entity14 says to @entity13 's mum while tinkering on the piano in their lounge room he does n't need to live with his mother now thanks to @entity7 providing him with manliness but do n't worry mum - ' you will still see my face because i 'm turning my old room into a storage space ' @entity13 also makes worthy note of @entity97 - the love of his life who he met when they ' both swiped right ' - referring to online dating site @entity94			1
and just in case his mother was n't sure where all of his manliness had come from - they give her a quick run - down			0
but @entity14 comforted his mum with the fact that ' you will still see my face because i 'm turning my old room into a storage space '			0
as the guys were carrying his stuff out of the door the son ends their cheery tune with ' can you lend me some money , can you help me find my keys and give us a lift to @entity9 please ? ' needless to say , they were last seen juggling all of the belonging on their bicycles			2
' sorry but @entity13 does n't need you anymore			0
