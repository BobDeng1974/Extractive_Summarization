last night the surgeon , a leading colonic specialist who worked at @entity32 ’s @entity35 , was asked to answer the claims			2
if they are found to be proved the doctor , who qualified in @entity39 , @entity40 in 1985 , could be struck off the medical register			0
at a hearing of the @entity44 ( @entity44 ) the panel was told friendship blossomed between the widow and the surgeon after the death of her husband in 2001			2

the hearing was told all the money that went through two joint accounts belonged to mrs @entity64 with the surgeon misappropriating almost £ 820,000			2
mr @entity83 said : ‘ all the financial capital came from mrs a throughout the relevant period as his only income came from his hospital salary			0
‘ by 2005 , her financial resources had been depleted while in complete contrast the doctor ’s fortunes had increased			0
’ the hearing was told that the surgeon , who represented himself at the hearing , believed some of the money had been ‘ a gift ’ from @entity21 to his children while he also claimed he had been owed commission on the sale of the widow ’s former flat			0
