@entity1 and disability charities are facing a growing public backlash for making a ‘ disgusting spectacle ’ of remarks by a government minister about minimum pay for disabled workers			1
shadow cabinet minister @entity8 looked shocked as a @entity10 audience turned on her when she demanded that welfare reform minister @entity11 should resign or be sacked			1
she insisted the peer had been ‘ offensive ’ in remarks secretly recorded by a @entity1 official at a fringe meeting of last month ’s @entity17 conference			1
lord @entity11 suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘ not worth ’ the £ 6.50 minimum wage and mused on whether the government might be able to top up their wages to enable more to get into workplaces			1
labour leader @entity32 ambushed @entity33 with a transcript of the recording at @entity37 ’s questions this week , also insisting the minister should be sacked			0
he has remained in his job after apologising , but miss @entity40 insisted on thursday night : ‘ i do think he should resign			1
i think what he said … has caused a great deal of offence to disabled people			0
‘ there are 50 per cent of people with disabilities who are not in work at the moment			0
the answer to that is n’t to somehow weaken the minimum wage and make them work for less than the minimum wage			2
’ health secretary @entity59 said on the programme it was clear @entity11 had been talking about the state ‘ topping up ’ the incomes of disabled people			1
lord @entity11 suggested that some disabled workers were seen as ‘ not worth ’ the £ 6.50 minimum wage one audience member agreed : ‘ i think @entity8 is being extremely disingenuous			1
i think we all knew what he meant , even though he said it clumsily			0
’ another person in the audience in @entity72 , @entity73 , told miss @entity40 : ‘ what you are doing is hypocritical point scoring and it ’s disgusting			1
’ a young woman said : ‘ i just wanted to see whether you [ @entity40 ] would use this as a political football and you have done – thanks @entity82			2
’ yesterday a @entity17 mp also defended @entity11 , insisting that the minimum wage was having a detrimental impact on disabled people ’s chances of finding work			1
@entity88 , a member of the commons public accounts committee , said the way @entity11 ’s remarks had been twisted by @entity1 and parts of the charitable sector was ‘ frankly disgusting ’			2
it emerged the charity @entity95 , which has led criticism of @entity11 , itself warned an estimated 1,000 people with severe learning disabilities had part - time jobs or had their working hours cut as a direct result of the national minimum wage			1
in 2000 , it called for an urgent revision of the rules to enable ‘ low output work ’ to be exempted from the rules			2
it now says the system to support disabled people into work has been transformed in the last 15 years and debate has moved on , ‘ as has our position ’			2
conservative mp @entity114 said : ‘ certain charities have seemed quick to make political attacks on what is a very serious and complex issue			0
charities should not be acting as mouthpieces for @entity1 ’s political point scoring			0
’ former @entity17 chairman @entity122 , whose wife @entity123 was badly disabled in the @entity125 bomb , said the attacks on @entity11 were a ‘ disgusting spectacle ’			1
‘ what lord @entity11 was being asked about was whether there are handicapped people who can not produce enough to justify in purely economic terms a wage of £ 6 an hour			2
my wife was capable of earning her pay as an experienced nurse until the sadistic criminals of @entity139 / @entity138 crippled her			0
she is worth no less today , but she could not justify a pay rate of £ 6 an hour			0
lord @entity11 was mulling over how to help such people			0
’ @entity1 's @entity142 published guidance in 2003 on when and where it might be acceptable to pay disabled people far less than the minimum wage			1
the department , then run by @entity149 , said the minimum wage applied to all workers – able - bodied or disabled			1
however , disabled people could be exempted from the minimum wage when they did work - related activity for therapeutic reasons , with no contractual obligation to work			2
the guidance gave various examples of when that could apply , after the government consulted with organisations including @entity159 , @entity95 and the @entity160			0
it gave the example of a farm where people develop social skills through involvement in agriculture , horticulture , caring for animals and training			0
other examples included a charity running a workshop for people with mental health problems , which it suggested , could pay them as little as £ 4 per day			0
a third example was a trust running a facility for mental health outpatients which does activities such as packing and assembly			0
they could be paid varying amounts up to just £ 20 per week .			0
