there is little fanfare as @entity2 poses patiently during a photoshoot in the @entity4 , where crowds gather for the best views of the @entity7			1
in the @entity16 ’s adopted city , locals instead pine for the likes of @entity11 and @entity12 , who fill out the @entity13 for @entity14			0
an altogether more impassioned reception can be expected if @entity2 braves the streets of @entity19 between now and friday night			1
the 28 - year - old is at the heart of head coach @entity23 ’s plan for the @entity25 opener against @entity26 and @entity27 expectations are high for the dress rehearsal for september ’s @entity30 a match			1
@entity2 poses for a photo in the @entity4 , in front of @entity34 ' @entity7 @entity2 ( centre ) will be part of @entity38 ' team to face @entity26 in the @entity25 opener on friday night @entity2 ( second right ) dives desperately to stop @entity26 's @entity41 when the sides met in march 2013 ‘ it ’s going to be a game of chess , ’ says the @entity44 centre			1
‘ it ’s going to be really intriguing to see how we approach the game and find each other out			2
ultimately , it ’s 80 minutes of complete warfare			0
when you ’ve played against @entity26 , it ’s serious , car - crash stuff — hugely physical — and it ’s a battle royal for us			1
’ over a coffee and a pizza in @entity34 ’s 16th arrondissement , @entity2 talks up the buzz of a test week back home , singling out the 30 - 3 victory over @entity26 in 2013 as his stand - out memory in a @entity38 jersey			1
he recalls the moment five minutes before full - time when he turned to winger @entity65 and said : ‘ mate , tonight ’s going to be big , ’ as well as the pride of playing in front of family members and childhood friends			0
‘ it was a magnificent day , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ you grow up loving the rivalry between @entity26 and @entity38 , in whichever sport			1
it ’s not hatred , that ’s taking it a bit far , but there ’s a certain loyalty to your @entity27 mates			0
the history is there and that makes the occasion so special			0
’ twelve of the starting xv who played in that test against @entity26 have been named in the line - up for friday ’s kick - off			1
there is a feeling of familiarity when @entity2 returns to camp in the @entity94 of @entity95 , particularly when the squad is blessed with a clean bill of health as it is for this year ’s competition			1
@entity38 and @entity100 smiles as he poses during a photoshoot in the @entity103 capital @entity38 trained at the @entity104 this week in preparation for friday 's showdown at the @entity107 @entity2 puts in a tackle on @entity26 's @entity110 during 2013 's @entity25 match in @entity19 , @entity38 it is a stark contrast to the situation at @entity113 , where a growing injury list has left the @entity26 camp scratching heads over a few new combinations			1
‘ experience counts for more than a settled squad , ’ says @entity2			1
‘ having players with 30 or 40 caps is worth a lot in a @entity30 year because these games are of big importance			0
it ’s key that we do n’t freeze , and @entity128 experience counts for a lot			0
‘ it buys you an extra second on the ball and lets you read things a bit quicker in defence			0
if you ’ve got 14 or 15 guys who have been through that together — experienced wins and losses together — it stands you in good stead			0
‘ @entity142 and i have the record centre partnership for @entity38 and we know each other ’s game inside out			1
that gives you confidence going into any game			2
‘ the fact that @entity26 maybe have n’t worked out their combination gives you a bit of a lift , but it can also prove to be dangerous			1
that uncertainty , players fighting for positions , can be a wonderful thing			0
’ @entity2 described taking on @entity26 as like ' 80 minutes of warfare ' , calling it a ' @entity160 ' the @entity38 centre ( left ) shares a joke with team - mate @entity163 during @entity38 ' open training session both @entity2 and @entity142 now play in @entity166 ’s @entity165 , although they struggled initially after making the switch			1
large budgets in the @entity103 league mean bigger squads , and playing opportunities are subsequently limited			0
there were reports near the end of 2014 suggesting @entity2 wanted to return to @entity175 but he insists he wants to see out his contract and is looking forward to working alongside big - money signing @entity178 next season			2
@entity2 lives in an apartment on the @entity181 of the @entity182 with morning training a 25 - minute scooter ride out of town			2
it is a cosmopolitan lifestyle for the qualified doctor , who admits he misses the mental challenge of the medical studies that he completed in 2013			0
racing have been doing well domestically and in the @entity190 , with the @entity191 beating @entity192 convincingly at @entity193 last week			0
@entity2 came out on top in his run - out against @entity196 , the @entity197 and @entity26 centre			1
as defensive captain for both club and country , he is responsible for setting the line - speed and ensuring his team - mates stick to pattern			2
@entity23 ( centre ) has been preparing his team for a huge @entity25 tie against @entity26 on friday @entity2 laughs as he throws the ball during @entity38 wednesday training session at the @entity210 the rush defence takes a well - weighted pass or an elusive running line to undo — which @entity26 may find difficult with their new combinations			1
in attack , @entity2 is at the heart of the physical ‘ @entity219 ’ approach			2
it is hard - hitting and often criticised for being belligerent , but it is becoming an increasingly common test strategy			0
‘ it ’s about balance , ’ says @entity2			2
‘ being able to play on the front foot is so valuable in international rugby			2
my role is to get defences back - pedalling , to give us more time in attack			0
‘ @entity231 is about going forward and it will never change			0
with the space that is afforded to you , that ’s normally through the heart of teams , rather than around them			0
‘ the game is n’t like it was in the @entity239 when you passed the ball to the winger and he scored in the corner off first phase			2
‘ you have to go forward and look at weak spots , which a lot of the time are in the opposition 10 channel			0
that ’s where we like to play the game			2
’ @entity2 will be sent down the channel of @entity26 fly - half @entity254 on friday night ; that much is no secret			1
it has all the makings of a happy homecoming .			0
