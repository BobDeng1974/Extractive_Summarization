tourists in @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity10 , will have to keep a closer eye on their cash than holidaymakers in @entity15 's @entity14 of six popular destinations surveyed by @entity17 , @entity15 ’s @entity14 offers the best value for money			2
budgets : families going away this half term may have to watch what they spend depending on where they are combining the cost of a half - term family holiday package for two adults and two children with meals and drinks for one week , a @entity14 break costs £ 1,108			1
the @entity32 ( £ 1,137 ) was close behind , followed by @entity33 ( £ 1,210 )			0
but budgets will be imperative for families flying to @entity36 in @entity37 ( £ 1,395 ) , @entity9 in @entity10 ( £ 1,619 ) and @entity8 ( £ 2,186 ) , where the recent change has shown a greater effect overall			0
the @entity14 was cheapest overall with the lowest package prices and resort costs , but prices for meals and drinks were also low in the @entity32 and @entity8			0
eating out costs more in @entity36 , but lower package holiday prices make the top @entity37 resort less expensive than @entity9 or @entity8			0
cost effective : @entity47 in @entity14 , @entity15 , is a destination where families will get more for their cash this year but the sterling 's slump against the euro hit @entity8 harder and families travelling there will have to budget families planning a half - term trip to @entity36 will also find their pounds stretch further as sterling currently buys 7.6 % more @entity37 lira than a year ago - the equivalent of more than £ 35 on a £ 500 exchange			1
elsewhere in @entity64 , while meals and drinks cost only 4 % more in @entity8 than in the @entity32 , higher half - term package prices push @entity8 into sixth place - 35 % more expensive than @entity9 and almost twice as much as the @entity14 @entity67 , of @entity17 , said : ' our new research proves just how important it is for families to check all costs when it comes to choosing a last - minute half - term destination			1
' the combination of low resort costs and cheap packages make the @entity14 best value overall , but with holiday prices changing all the time , the @entity32 and @entity33 are still worthy contenders this half term			2

@entity14 , @entity15 , is most cost - effective but @entity8 is the least out of six
