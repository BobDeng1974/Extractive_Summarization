@entity1 protest : @entity2 wants the supermarket to stay away what are the biggest threats facing @entity6 today ? its soaring house prices ? the continually expanding national debt ? extreme @entity11 terrorists ? apparently not , according to @entity12 - winning actress @entity2			1
for her , the most urgent problem is the terrifying ogre of another source of fresh , reasonably priced food			1
she is campaigning to stop a new @entity19 opening in @entity20 , a charming neighbourhood near @entity21 in @entity6 , the heart of luvvie - dom and home of left - leaning millionaires for half a century			1
‘ @entity20 is a villagey area			1
it has no need of a @entity1 and its very nature will be threatened , ’ @entity2 said in an open letter to @entity1			1
‘ the people who live there do not want it			2
they already have food shops , ones they trust and that retain a local feel to them			2
wherever @entity1 goes , the local feeling is destroyed by staff who neither know nor care to know the inhabitants			2
’ @entity2 does n’t actually live in @entity20 — she lives in @entity41 , two miles away from the proposed shop on @entity43			1
still , why should that stop an actress with an inflated sense of self - worth telling genuine locals where they should do their shopping ? she is n’t the only one			2
other actors to sign a 2,900 - strong petition to stop the shop opening in a former bank include dame @entity54 and @entity55			2
‘ this idea of plonking chain - store locals into village @entity62 , i think , is damaging , ’ said the @entity57 actress at a local meeting to discuss the new shop			1
‘ what it does is put a kind of unwanted marker down in our manor			2
’ leading the protest is another actor , @entity70 , who says independent shops are the lifeblood of the area			1
a photograph of @entity70 ’s face greets you at the tills of nearby supermarket rival @entity78 , also on @entity43			1
next to his picture is the printed slogan : ‘ @entity82 [ sic ] need , @entity82 [ sic ] @entity83			2
’ @entity70 , best known for his roles in the 1989 film @entity85 and as @entity87 ’s father in the @entity89 sitcom @entity87 , is a one - man protest band in @entity6			1
in recent years he has also fought a housing development in nearby @entity92			2
i ’ve lived in millionaire luvvieland all my life — first in my parents ’ house in @entity98 , @entity6 , and now in @entity92 , a mile away from the proposed @entity1			1
and i ’d be delighted if a new @entity1 store opens			1
in fact , i ’m delighted every time a cheap , reliable shop selling useful things , such as food and drink , opens			2
conversely , my heart sinks when shops offering overpriced organic food and pointless knick - knacks start up			2
celebrity protests against cheap food outlets are nothing new			2
i can remember the ‘ @entity111 ’s ’ that raged through the @entity113 @entity112 of nearby @entity41 in the @entity114			2
for 12 years , from 1980 to 1992 , the fast - food chain fought to open an outlet there , opposed by local activists who launched a ‘ @entity119 off ! ’ campaign			2
among them were @entity70 , of course , and the novelist @entity123			0
‘ my loathing of @entity125 ’s is intense , ’ @entity123 said at the time			0
‘ there are advantages in development , provided it is the right sort , but there are already too many takeaway restaurants in @entity41			0
’ leading the protest is another actor , @entity70 ( left ) while comedian @entity55 ( right ) is among celebrities to sign a petition against the store 's construction that campaign was led by the now - deceased @entity139 , a @entity140 councillor and the mother of @entity142 ( the broadcaster and son - in - law of @entity146 @entity145 )			1
you might have thought @entity140 supporters would be keen on food that is popular with less privileged voters			0
not , though , when it ’s being sold on their own doorstep			0
when @entity125 ’s finally triumphed — after a battle in which the local council spent £ 25,000 of taxpayers ’ money and which ended up in the @entity158 — a condition was that the restaurant had to be a middle class - friendly outlet			0
so it was given a discreet facade and classical music was played inside			0
the only other time @entity167 faced such opposition was in @entity168 , in @entity169 , @entity170 — @entity172 ’s equivalent of @entity41 luvvieland			0
there , the chain failed to open an outlet thanks to heavyweight objection from gilt - edged @entity178 including singer @entity179 and actress @entity180			0
what must make the @entity1 row even more infuriating for objectors is that the alternative plan for the site , which @entity1 saw off , was a bid for a new restaurant from @entity188 , who owns five restaurants , including @entity191 , a two - @entity193 - starred establishment in even ritzier @entity194			1
now you see what the @entity197 protesters are really after — upmarket , super-priced food			0
‘ what do we want ? @entity202 , tomato butter and basil , like at the @entity205 ! when do we want it ? after a first course of scallops , shaved kohlrabi [ fancy cabbage ] , seaweed oil and frozen horseradish ! ’ a four - course lunch at @entity191 , without wine or service , costs £ 80 — nothing for a multi-millionaire actress			0
for many @entity219 , though , that ’s a day ’s wages			0
but ordinary people do n’t get a word in edgeways when they are drowned out by celebrities , who also do n’t seem to care that @entity1 is offering to provide 20 new jobs			1
‘ what on earth has it got to do with @entity2 ? ’ says @entity226 , a writer who lives near the proposed shop			1
‘ she is a colossal busybody			0
’ the site of the proposed new @entity1 store on @entity43 , @entity20 , @entity6			1
objected to by @entity2 and other celebrities ‘ residents — many of whom live on limited budgets — are currently paying over and above what they could pay , ’ said local @entity235 in a letter to the local paper			1
to be fair , about half the residents i talked to shared @entity2 ’s views			1
for example , @entity246 , a retired barrister , said the @entity78 was adequate			0
‘ there ’s a fair range and it ’s a pleasant place to shop			0
another @entity1 will impact on local grocery shops			0
’ meanwhile , there ’s another celeb protest brewing in this neck of the woods — against the mansion tax			0
this , too , is surrounded by a whiff of left - wing hypocrisy			0
the tax , which @entity140 says it would immediately introduce on houses worth more than £ 2 million if it wins the @entity261 in may , could mean people living in such homes having to pay , on average , an extra £ 23,595 a year			0
boy , oh boy ! the traditionally @entity140 - supporting bigwigs in this neck of the woods — normally so keen on tax rises and punishing the rich — are dead against it			0
most of them live in £ 2 million - plus houses			0
this month @entity273 , the @entity140 politician who lives in a house thought to be worth £ 8 million , attacked the tax , as have @entity140 peers @entity276 , who lives in a multi-million - pound home in @entity41 , and fertility doctor professor @entity278			0
critics claim a branch of @entity1 will have a damaging effect on local shops in the area ( pictured above ) @entity70 is also against such a tax being levied on the valuable @entity41 home he bought for a song 30 years ago			1
last may , when the @entity287 were proposing a similar tax , @entity70 said : ‘ if the @entity290 mr @entity289 ever got his desire for a mansion tax , we would n’t be able to live here			0
’ the fact is , the millionaire celebrities want to keep this part of @entity6 just as it was when they arrived here a generation ago			1
or 55 years ago , in the case of @entity2 , who lives in the same @entity41 street in which she was brought up			1
in the golden days of the @entity302 and @entity303 , people could buy a double - fronted house in desirable @entity6 for £ 30,000			1
now those same houses are going for £ 5 million and these fabulously rich actors want to preserve their neighbourhood just as it was , pulling up the drawbridge behind them — in just the same way that labour politicians who went to grammar schools prevented others following their path by dismantling the selective schools that had done so much to help social mobility			0
it ’s increasingly hard to afford to live in @entity6 these days			1
and if this @entity319 campaign has its way , fewer people will be able to do their shopping round here , either .			0
