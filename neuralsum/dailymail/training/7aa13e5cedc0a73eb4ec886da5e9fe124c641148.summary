think of solar panels and vast ‘ fields ’ of blue silicon or a patchwork of panels covering a roof probably spring to mind			2
but now scientists have developed a breakthrough type of solar panel that can be placed directly over a window to harvest the sun ’s energy , while remaining completely transparent			2
the technology could lead to self - sufficient buildings or mobile phone screens that charge handsets when left in sunlight			1
scientists say the ‘ transparent luminescent solar concentrator ’ ( pictured ) could be used on buildings , mobiles and ‘ any other device that has a clear surface			1
the solar harvesting material uses specially - developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight and convert it to electricity researchers at @entity32 developed the ‘ transparent luminescent solar concentrator ’ which they say could be used on buildings , mobiles and ‘ any other device that has a clear surface ’			1
for years scientists have tried to produce energy harvested from solar cells made from luminescent plastic - like materials , but the technologies have performed poorly			1
the energy production was inefficient and the materials were highly coloured			0
‘ no one wants to sit behind coloured glass , ’ said @entity42 , an assistant professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the university			0
the technology used in the transparent material ( pictured left ) could lead to glass skyscrapers such as @entity52 's @entity51 ( pictured right ) becoming self - sufficient buildings covered in solar panels that are still light and airy to live in , or mobile phone screens that charge handsets in the daylight the solar harvesting material uses specially - developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight			1
it can be tuned to pick up just the ultraviolet and the near infrared wavelengths that then ‘ glow ’ at another wavelength in the infrared			0
the glowing infrared light is guided to the edge of the plastic where it is converted to electricity by thin strips of photovoltaic solar cells			2
because the material does not absorb or emit light in the visible spectrum , it looks transparent to the human eye and could therefore be used on next generation phone screens and windows			1
‘ it makes for a very colourful environment , like working in a disco			0
we take an approach where we actually make the luminescent active layer itself transparent			0
’ his solar harvesting material does this by using specially - developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight			1
‘ we can tune these materials to pick up just the ultraviolet and the near infrared wavelengths that then “ glow ” at another wavelength in the infrared , ’ he said			0
the glowing infrared light is guided to the edge of the plastic where it is converted to electricity by thin strips of photovoltaic solar cells			2
professor @entity42 explained : ‘ because the materials do not absorb or emit light in the visible spectrum , they look exceptionally transparent to the human eye			0
’ he believes that the technology has the potential to be scaled so it could be used cheaply in the next generation of commercial products as well as in industries			0
‘ it opens a lot of area to deploy solar energy in a non-intrusive way , ’ he said			0
scientists believe that the technology has the potential to be scaled to be used cheaply in the next generation of commercial products as well as in the building industries			0
this means that solar panels could look just like windows in houses of the future , instead of being displayed on roof tops ( stock image ) ‘ it can be used on tall buildings with lots of windows or any kind of mobile device that demands high aesthetic quality like a phone or e-reader			1
‘ ultimately we want to make solar harvesting surfaces that you do not even know are there			1
’ professor @entity42 said that more work is needed to improve the efficiency of the material			0
it currently has a solar conversion efficiency close to 1 percent but could reach five per cent when fully developed			2
the best coloured luminescent solar concentrator is around seven per cent efficient .			1

researchers at @entity32 developed the transparent panels
they could be used on buildings instead of windows and for phone screens
unlike other luminescent plastic - like materials it is *colourless*
solar harvesting material uses specially - developed organic molecules to absorb certain invisible wavelengths of sunlight and convert it to electricity
material could be 5 per cent efficient when fully - developed
