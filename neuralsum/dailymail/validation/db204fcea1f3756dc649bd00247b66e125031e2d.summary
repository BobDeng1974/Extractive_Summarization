@entity0 received a parking ticket after leaving her car in front of her own family 's driveway - despite displaying her visitor 's badge a driver was left furious after she received a parking ticket for pulling up outside her parents ' home			1
@entity0 was hit with the £ 25 fine after she parked her car across the driveway while visiting april and @entity13 at their house in @entity16 , @entity17			1
the 23 - year - old , from @entity19 , @entity20 , had even placed the visitor 's permit in the window just in case and left it overnight			1
but she was shocked when she returned to the car the next morning to find a traffic warden had slapped a ticket on the red @entity28 because it was parked just centimetres outside a marked bay			1
ms @entity0 , whose family have lived in @entity16 for 15 years , said : ' i drove back to the family home late , and parked over my parents ' drive as i almost always do when i know they are not needing to go out that night			1
' just to be on the safe side , i also put the visitors permit in my car - not that it really needs to be there as i 'm over my parents ' drive			1
' my brother saw a parking warden looking at my car			0
he thought this was unusual so went out to see what was wrong			0
i was shocked to discover the parking warden was issuing me a ticket			0
' my younger brother immediately asked why , he said ' the permit is in , it 's my sisters car so we 're allowed to park over our own drive ' but the parking warden simply replied saying the car was ' outside of a marked bay			1
' he meant my wheel was a fraction over the white line of the bay behind , but not obstructing anyone or any car			0
' ms @entity0 , an actuary , said she and her brother had tried to reason with the warden , and had offered the move the car immediately to no avail			2
' the warden replied saying he had already printed the ticket so there was no point , ' she added			0
the 23 - year - old had parked in front of the drive in @entity16 , @entity17 ( pictured ) but was given a fine after being told she had not parked in the correct bay ' i nearly always park over my parents drive , i had a permit in my car to be sure it was okay , and if i was a few centimetres forward , it would not have affected anybody or any car			1
' i am now left with fine to pay because my car was parked over my own family 's driveway			0
' i think this shows very clearly what all the national press are saying , councils in @entity88 are simply using parking fines as a ' cash cow '			0
' they were going so by the book and they did n't use any common sense			0
' @entity0 added : ' i have spoken to neighbours who said they have had a similar problem with getting parking fines while parked just slightly over the white lines			2
' it 's just so frustrating for my family , as they have to pay for their resident and visitor parking permits			0
the £ 25 fine , issued by a @entity107 civil enforcement officer has since been cancelled ' they pay their way , and do n't expect their family to get fined for parking over their own property			1
' a penalty charge notice was issued by @entity107 , stating the car was ' not parked correctly within the markings of the bay or space			2
' a @entity107 spokesman said the civil enforcement officer was correct to serve a penalty but yesterday confirmed the ticket had been cancelled			2
he said : ' having reconsidered the comments by the driver we have exercised our discretion and given her the benefit of the doubt and the penalty has been cancelled			0
