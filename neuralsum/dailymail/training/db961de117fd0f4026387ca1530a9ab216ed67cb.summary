the website that became ground zero for the nude photos hacking scandal has announced a ban on all naked or sexual images posted without consent			1
@entity7 , the sprawling , user - run forum site which brands itself ' the front page of the internet ' , will impose the ban next month			1
it comes months after the site was criticized for openly directing users to pornographic hacked images of the likes of @entity17 and @entity18 on a dedicated page set up to spread them			1
victims : @entity18 , left , and @entity17 , were the highest - profile victims of the nude hacking scandal , images from which @entity7 allowed on its forums			1
@entity25 in particular hit back against everyone who shared , viewed and hosted the pictures , saying they were complicit in a ' sex crime ' against her ' front page of the internet ' : @entity7 , shown above , has 160million users and a history of lax policing on its site			1
it admitted that it ' missed the chance ' to act when the photos first leaked while the company eventually closed the section down , thousands of people had already accessed the images , generating huge ad revenues for @entity7 in the process			2
under the new rules , effective from march 10 , all images of any person either naked , aroused or having sex which are posted by the site 's 160million users without consent are banned			1
anything which is posted will be removed , @entity7 said , and potential victims were given a contact address to flag any banned posts			2
previous rules had banned only child pornography , and content perceived to be spam - though volunteer moderators could also remove items if they chose			0
in a post signed by @entity65 's interim ceo @entity64 , she acknowledged that the site ' missed the chance ' to act decisively while the nude photos leaks was happening			1
caught in the trap : @entity70 , left , and @entity71 , right , were also pictured naked in the stolen photographs she said : ' no matter who you are , if a photograph , video , or digital image of you in a state of nudity , sexual excitement , or engaged in any act of sexual conduct , is posted or linked to on reddit without your permission , it is prohibited on reddit			2
' the photo leak drew a furious reaction from the celebrities featured , many of whom confirmed that the images were legitimate			2
@entity25 in particular was strident in her criticism of the leaks , which began last august			0
she said anybody involved in spreading the pictures was complicit in a ' sex crime ' against her and should ' cower in shame '			0
it comes at the same time as @entity102 announced its @entity104 service would also enact a blanket ban on all pornographic posts later this month			0
new policy : @entity65 ceo @entity108 , left , announced the policy change			0
she is pictured above at a @entity111 courthouse , where she is suing former employers from march 23 , any sexually explicit or ' graphic nude ' images will be removed from public view , and the account owners will find their sites switched to a invite - only mode			1
nude pictures which are ' artistic , educational , documentary , or scientific contexts ' will not be included in the ban			2
social media sites have varying policies on nudity			0
@entity126 prohibits images containing nudity altogether , which has enraged some mothers banned from sharing pictures of them breastfeeding their children			0
@entity132 does n't mediate legal content but recommends that content with nudity or violence be marked as sensitive			0
it also lets users flag questionable content for review .			0
