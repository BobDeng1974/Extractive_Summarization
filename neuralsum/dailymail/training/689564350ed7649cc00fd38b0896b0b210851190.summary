most bank account holders have heard of card skimmers , the insidious devices that steal your details from inside a cash machine			1
now , however , there is another danger to watch out for at the hole - in - the - wall - the ' cash trap '			2
the simple , claw - like implement sits inside the slot that dispenses notes and grabs hold of customers ' money until the thief returns to collect the loot			1
invisible crime : claw - like cash trap devices , which are inserted into @entity19 to grab cash before it can be dispensed to the customer @entity23 : the simple contraptions inserted into cash - dispensing slots have been spotted in @entity26 and across @entity27 the devices have been used at cash points across @entity30 , with 2,479 reported cases in the first half of 2012			1
fraud losses through cash trapping and other atm scams across the @entity30 came to £ 29.3million last year , according to @entity36 , although this is said to be dropping since chip and pin was introduced in 2004			1
such scams are already rife across @entity27			0
thieves stole more than a million euros from @entity43 cash machines this year using devices that prop open note - dispensing slots , according to security experts			1
police have warned account holders to be vigilant , but many devices are impossible to spot			0
some are designed to look like part of the machine and attached to the front , and others - such as the claw - are completely hidden inside the atm			1
this can mean that customers remain unaware of the problem and simply assume there is a fault with the @entity19 , failing to report the crime			0
jaws : cash trapping device is shown removed from the machine			1
police have warned customers to look out for anything unusual at @entity19 the @entity27 @entity68 advises customers to immediately report all incidents to the bank			0
in august , @entity72 issued a warning to cash machine users after fraudsters tampered with three machines in @entity77 and @entity78 , pocketing hundreds of pounds from one transaction			1
officers warned anyone who spots anything unusual on an @entity19 , finds a device or notices part of the machine falling off to contact the police as soon as possible			2
the tricks used to steal money from bank accounts are sophisticated , varied and widely used			0
here is how they have developed : spring traps : once a card has been inserted , these prevent it from being returned to the customer and stop the atm from retracting it			2
cash traps : claw - like implements are inserted into cash - dispensing slot to ' capture or skim some of the dispensed bills '			1
@entity103 : an oversized fork - like device is jammed into the cash dispenser slot to keep it open following a normal @entity19 transaction			1
skimmers : thieves lift the data from cards through handheld skimmers or via magnetic strip readers			1
the data can then be re-encoded on to blank cards and used at @entity19 along with victim ’s pin to withdraw cash			1
transaction reversal fraud : @entity19 into not debiting some of the cash that has been taken or manipulating the @entity19 to pay more than the balance available			2
can be done via clips or fingers or by removing some notes so machine does not realise it has dispensed them			0
a spokesperson for the force said : ' unfortunately , there was insufficient forensic and @entity130 evidence [ in @entity78 ] to progress the investigation and no arrests were made			0
' the @entity77 incidents related to @entity19 possibly being tampered with and no actual thefts occurred			0
' the banks do n’t always notify police in these cases if no crime has taken place and their own fraud departments investigate the matter			0
' atm tampering is obviously a nationwide issue and we work with the banks to raise awareness and educate the public about how to protect themselves from fraud and what things to be on the lookout for			0
' most of the crimes apparently take place outside of normal banking hours			0
a spokesperson for @entity157 said : ' the criminals operate by cash being collected by a customer			0
as far as a customer is concerned everything can be going fine with their transaction and the receipt - if they get one - can say " £ 20 taken out " , but they 've got no money			1
' the cash trap is normally placed across the front of the cash dispensing slot , either with adhesive or a spring			2
the claw is one variant , which is placed inside machine and is a little more sophisticated			2
' the criminals make one transaction and insert the device while the slot is open			2
' we saw a significant increase in these attacks in 2011 , with 15 @entity27 countries reporting such crimes , and a surge in the second half of the year			0
' the success of chip and pin seems to be driving criminals from high - tech card skimming to low - tech techniques such as cash trapping			1
' this can be combined with other ways of manipulating the atm			0
' it is estimated that in the first six months of 2004 , more than £ 40.5million was fraudulently taken from customers ' accounts using card skimming in @entity199 and the @entity200 alone			1
in march 2005 , @entity202 - based @entity201 had £ 1,500 stolen from his @entity204 current account after his debit card was copied and used in @entity206			1
four months later , five @entity207 stole up to £ 1.2m by sticking false fronts to atms across @entity199 to skim unwitting customers ' cards and film their pin numbers being entered			1
a laptop found at the gang 's safe house contained details of 1,236 bank cards			2
it is believed most of the cash was channelled to @entity207 in a ' fruitful and sophisticated fraud '			0
helping themselves : thieves stole more than a million euros from @entity43 cash machines this year using a similar technique , pictured , in which cash - dispensing slots are propped open after normal transactions since the advent of chip and pin , however , cash traps may be the most worrying trend , because they are simple , cheap and spreading fast			1
earlier this year , industry experts reported on the danger of ' robbing by radiowave ' - in which thieves access ' contactless ' cardholders ' details simply by walking past them in the street and activating a handheld machine			1
a spokesperson for @entity241 told @entity242 they had seen a move back to more traditional methods of fraud such as shoulder surfing since chip and pin came in			0
cardholders who are given a contactless card when their old one expires can unknowingly surrender their details to a thief by simply walking past them in the street			2
the technology in the card , known as radio frequency identification ( @entity259 ) , transmits bank details via its own radio signal , and is accepted in many @entity263 chains , including co-op , boots and @entity266			0
lucrative scam : a simple fork , pictured , can be placed inside the machine to hold it open after customers have left it does away with the need for a customer inputting their pin when buying goods , and was designed to reduce queues at the checkout			2
however , a fraudster with a contactless cardreader can easily collect the 16 - digit credit card number , expiry date and name – known as @entity285 – from anyone who walks past carrying one of the new cards			1
they then have enough information to rack up huge bills at any internet shopping site that does not demand the three - digit security code on the back of the card			0
@entity296 , a former policeman and director of @entity298 , a firm which specialises in protection against card fraud , said : ‘ it has been a big problem in @entity302 for a while and is getting to be a big problem over here			0
’ cards can be protected from @entity259 skimmers by being wrapped in tin foil or being kept in special foil - lined wallets .			0

gadgets snatch money from inside dispenser before it is released
@entity72 reported three incidents in august , with gangs pocketing hundreds of pounds in just one theft
other cash point frauds include ' skimming ' card details or tricking the machine into dispensing more cash than the available balance
thieves can also obtain data using radiowaves from ' contactless ' cards
@entity330 stole more than a million euros from @entity43 atms this year using a device that props open cash - dispensing slots
cash trapping and other atm scams cost the @entity30 £ 29.3million last year
