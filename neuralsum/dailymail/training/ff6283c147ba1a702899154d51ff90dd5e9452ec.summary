' the 60 - year - old became an @entity2 militant when he was just a teenager , and played a crucial part in the bombing of the @entity5 in 1973			1
one person was killed and nearly 200 injured when a car bomb went off outside @entity41 's top criminal court , in the @entity42			0
mr @entity8 was arrested and sentenced to life in prison over the bombing , and joined dozens of other @entity2 members on hunger strike in @entity7 , near @entity48			1

' two shots were fired at the guard - one of which hit him in the head , although he survived the shooting - and the official report into the escape named mr @entity8 as the gunman			1
book : mr @entity8 is publishing this memoir about the prison break at the maze this week he told the @entity81 : ' there were two shots fired			1
there was myself and others there , so clearly it was a prisoner who shot him			0
but that is as far as i will go			0
' although he insists he has now renounced violence , he said that ' the struggle has to be defended ' , and described the @entity7 escape as ' a very proud moment '			2
the chairman of @entity9 's @entity96 said that mr @entity8 's actions were not ' something he should be proud of ' , and accused him of re-opening old wounds			2
' i do n't think it 's something he should be proud of â€“ that he shot a prison officer in the head in an attempt to escape , ' @entity100 told the @entity105			2
he added that prison officers had ' come to get used to these boys glorifying their terrorism ' , adding : ' if they say they 're wanting to move on and put the past behind them , then they should n't be bringing up these acts of terrorism in the past			1
' unionist politicians reacted with fury to the news of mr @entity8 's book and called on him to apologise for the break - out			1
' this is not something in any way worthy of celebration , ' said @entity123 , who represents the @entity124 on the @entity125			0
' rather @entity8 should be apologising to the victims and their families			2
' it is clear to everyone , even those who would be sympathetic to nationalism , that @entity8 has a twisted mind when it comes to the past and the events of the @entity136			2
' carnage : the scene outside the @entity5 in @entity139 following a car bomb detonated by mr @entity8 @entity141 , leader of the @entity142 , said that mr @entity8 was 're - traumatising many families ' with his memoir			1
' for his victims , his book is n't " a great yarn " , but instead a nightmare relived , ' he told the @entity148			0
' he can write as many books as he likes , but he wo n't rewrite history			0
' but mr @entity8 told the @entity81 : ' i 've tried to do what i did with integrity			0
people might baulk at that , but i think i 've come through life with some integrity			0
' you might think everything the @entity2 did was wrong , but i do n't			0
' following the @entity7 escape , he was recaptured in the @entity163 and extradited to @entity41 , but was released in 1989			2
he was considered a key point of contact between the @entity2 and @entity9 politicians during the peace process , and was elected to represent @entity168 in the @entity169 in 1998			0
mr @entity8 is now @entity11 's spokesman for policing and justice , and sits on the @entity125			1
forbidding : the entrance to @entity7 in @entity173 , site of the 1983 escape the escape from @entity7 on september 25 , 1983 , was described at the time by @entity177 as ' the gravest in our prison history '			1
the jail in @entity181 , nine miles from @entity48 , was notorious for housing paramilitary prisoners , and was regarded by many @entity2 members as a symbol of repression			0
many of the most feared terrorists were held in the specially constructed ' @entity7 ' , where hunger strikes and ' dirty protests ' became common			0
although the @entity7 was supposed to be the most secure prison in @entity192 , officers had apparently grown complacent in the months before the break - out after @entity8 and other prisoners pretended to start co-operating			1
using six guns which had been smuggled in to the facility , @entity2 members took their guards hostage , preventing them from raising the alarm			0
the prisoners then took over part of the jail and took the officers ' uniforms , subsequently comandeering a lorry which was delivering supplies to the prison and using it to drive to the outer fence			0
although officers fought back , 38 prisoners made it past the fence and fled into the surrounding countryside as it took authorities nearly two hours to bring the maze back under control			0
20 prison guards were injured in the escape by being shot , stabbed or beaten , while officer @entity220 collapsed and died after he was stabbed with a chisel			2
half of the escapees were caught within two days of the break - out , but most of the others made it to the @entity2 stronghold of @entity229 and were offered the chance to build a new life in @entity232			0
some - including mr @entity8 - were recaptured and returned to prison , while others were killed in clashes with @entity41 troops , but several escaped the authorities and two have never been tracked down at all .			2

@entity8 , 60 , bombed the @entity5 in 1973 and led the escape from @entity7 in 1983
now he has written a book , @entity63 , telling story of the prison break
@entity8 refuses to deny that he shot guard and describes pointing gun at him
