by @entity0 published : 06:15 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:34 est , 6 february 2014 when @entity4 separated from her first husband , she was left to fend for herself and her two daughters while they had no roof over their head			1
for four years in the 1970s , the family were forced to move from house to house and learned to feed themselves on the little money they had			1
this meant the mother - of - two came up with various recipes which enabled her to make breakfast , lunch and dinner from the pennies in her jar			1
now , the 62 - year - old has developed more than 150 of the cut - price methods which can now feed a family for less than £ 1 a day			1
bargain bites : @entity4 , 62 , claims she has more than 150 recipes which show you can feed yourself for less than 50p miss @entity4 , who is retired , said : ' without a roof over my head and no money at all , i learnt to budget			1
i know that when you ’re struggling , having something nice to eat becomes even more important and i want to show it ’s possible to have that			2
' most people i speak to say you ca n’t feed yourself for under 50p but i have over 150 recipes which show that well actually , you can			1
' right now , there are a lot of individuals in @entity42 who are struggling			2
i ’m just trying to get the message across that you can make good food for a reasonable price			2
' a typical day consists of 4p pancakes for breakfast , spiced parsnip soup for 17p with 2p tomato scones for lunch and a supper of bacon and sweetcorn pie with mash and peas for just 32p			1
to top it all off , there ’s a muscovado cheesecake for dessert which costs only 33p to make			2
tight - budget : she learned to make the cut - price meals while providing for her two daughters while the family was homeless in the 1970s @entity68 pincher : her specially - made vegetable crumble costs only 40p miss @entity4 , who lives with her partner of 32 years , @entity70 , admits : ' i get a thrill from a bargain			1
although i do n’t really have any major financial fears anymore , my early years were quite rough			2
' i know what it feels like to worry about money - that memory never leaves you			2
so finding or making something that does n’t cost too much is a real buzz for me			2
' at the age of 16 , miss @entity4 met an older man and fell pregnant			1
she married him but realised it was was a mistake			2
she left her husband while pregnant with her second child and returned to her parents ’ house			1
however it was so crowded that her and her children had to sleep under a table			0
she was homeless between 1971 and 1975 before she moved into a council house with her two children , @entity95 and @entity96			1
a a daily meal plan from left to right : it begins with pancakes for breakfast , costing 4p , lunch is a tomato scone made for 2 - 3p alongside 17p spicy parsnip soup			1
dinner is bacon and sweetcorn pie with mash and peas ( 32p ) followed by @entity108 , made for 33p ' there was literally no room left at my family home and so for the next four years , my daughters and i ricocheted from place to place			1
we had nowhere to live and although we never actually slept rough , it came horrifyingly close			0
the experience left miss @entity4 with an interest in ‘ all things frugal ’			1
even today , she will do anything to cut costs , making her body moisturiser from scratch by mixing glycerine and water together			0
for each seven - day meal plan , the cut price chef sets out an amount to take to the supermarket along with a shopping list.the food is then supposed to feed two people for a week , but some of the items are left over			1
the above meal plan costs just £ 12.26 for the week ( that is £ 6.13 per person )			0
however , you have to take £ 15.89 to the checkout so you can buy full amounts			0
she also serves up her budget dishes - such as 15p gnocchi made from instant mashed potato - at dinner parties			1
' my £ 1 - per - day meals are lovely , they ’re just as a good as a more expensive dish			1
i ’ve made them for plenty of guests and no - one ’s ever been able to guess the price			0
' people always talk about needing more money to have a better life			0
but really if you just make better use of the money that you do have , then you can achieve the same thing			0
' miss @entity4 has spent years designing the meals			1
she claims they follow the government guidelines and provide one person 's five a day			1
her meal plans and recipes are recorded on her blog @entity169			2
