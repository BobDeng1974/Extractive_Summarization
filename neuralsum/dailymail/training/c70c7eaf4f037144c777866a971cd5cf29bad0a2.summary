by @entity0 published : 12:15 est , 23 october 2012 updated : 19:38 est , 23 october 2012 they are less than two weeks old , but these piglets already have wrinkles and are making history			2
the litter of eight @entity7 piglets are the first of their kind to be born in the @entity11 for thirty years			1
the breed , with their long floppy ears and wrinkly faces , is popular in @entity16 but has never been properly introduced in this country			1
one of a kind : the first litter of rare @entity7 piglets in the @entity11 for 30 years was born at @entity21 in @entity22 and @entity23 owner @entity24 , 51 , brought the litter ’s year - old mother @entity25 and nine - month - old father wrinkles over from northern @entity28 with husband @entity29 , 47 , last year			1
and two weeks ago @entity25 gave birth to seven girls and one boy			1
the couple plan to start the @entity11 ’s first pedigree line of the species and have already sold two of the litter to a smallholder in @entity39			2
@entity24 , from @entity40 , @entity22 and @entity23 , now intends to bring other boars in from @entity42 to create a foundation @entity7 family from which every pig in the @entity11 will descend			2
she said : ‘ we are really pleased with the birth			0
they are the first to be born in this country for about 30 years so it ’s very exciting to be involved			0
proud mother : @entity25 gave birth to her new brood two weeks ago hello ! four of the piglets peek out from their sty			1
meishans are a popular breed in @entity16 because of their unusually large ears and wrinkly faces ‘ we went across to @entity28 to stay with a friend who also breeds pigs			1
we did n’t set out with the intention of buying anything but when i saw them i just fell in love with them and bought two sows then and there and later a boar			0
‘ i have never seen anything like them in my life			0
‘ they are really prolific breeders in @entity16 and are very popular because of their unusual appearance and fatty meat but for some reason they have never taken off here and i want to change that			0
’ owner @entity24 with mother and piglets			0
she has been breeding pigs for 15 years hot to trot : two of the piglets frolick around in the grass outsie the sty curious : the litter contains seven girls and one boy and two have already been sold to a smallholder in @entity39 the two sows and boar cost @entity24 £ 2,000 as a trio and each female can litter up to 15 babies			1
the @entity7 species is native to southern @entity16 and when fully grown can measure up to three feet high and four feet long			2
meishans were last seen in the @entity11 over 30 years ago , when 20 pigs were imported from @entity16 by a @entity11 genetics company for research purposes , but the animals were never bred			1
the species ’ ability to produce large litters means they have also become popular in the @entity112 and @entity113 in recent years			0
one big happy family : mrs @entity24 bought a trio of pigs for £ 2,000			1
each female can litter up to 15 piglets best foot forward : the piglets take their some of their first tentative steps outside of the safety of their pigsty mother - of - two @entity24 , originally from @entity126 , in @entity127 , has been breeding pigs for 15 years			0
she added : ‘ @entity103 are brilliant outdoor animals to have , they have a lovely temperament and they are brilliant with children			0
‘ they are not pets by any means - they ca n’t be kept in the house like micro-pigs , but they are fantastic to keep and it would be great to see them take off in this country			0
