by @entity0 they are a staple at sports games , an @entity5 favourite and , many people would argue , a delicious guilty pleasure			0
but what really goes into a hotdog - and if you saw how it was made , would you be put off for life ? these gruesome images show a hotdog production plant - and the various stages of manufacturing are n't pretty			1
as the programme explains , hotdogs are made from trimmings of meat left over after cutting steaks and pork chips			1
these are ground in the same way as hamburger meat , pushing the cuts of meat through metal plates so it resembles mince			2
the processed chicken trimmings - which resemble clay - are then added to the mix , along with salt , starch and flavourings			2
once water is sprayed into that vat , the images become even more stomach churning , resembling ice cream or mud			1
corn syrup is added for a touch of sweetness before the mixture is pureed to a ' fine emulsion , ' producing the stomach - churning image below			0
@entity57 is then vaccumed out of the mix before it is pumped into cellulose casings			0
even at this stage , hotdogs are fast food			0
as the programme explains , it takes just 35 seconds to make enough hotdogs to span a football field twice			0
in one shift at the factory , a staggering 2.5 million hotdogs will be produced			2
but the real question - how do they get that more - ish flavour ? a liquid ' smoke shower ' before they are baked - followed by a good dousing of salty water before they are packaged			1

gruesome images show stages of manufacturing at a hotdog factory
were filmed by the @entity19 's ' how it 's made ' *series*
dregs of pork , beef and chicken are ground together then reduced to pulp
later re-formed and made into hotdog sprayed with ' smoke flavour '
