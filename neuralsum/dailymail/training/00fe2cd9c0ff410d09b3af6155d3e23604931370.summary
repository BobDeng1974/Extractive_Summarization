by @entity0 published : 05:48 est , 26 september 2013 updated : 06:19 est , 26 september 2013 a devastated mother has told how doctors sent her one - year - old son home with a leaflet after failing to diagnose that he had suffered a stroke			1
@entity7 was discharged from hospital hours after his worried mother @entity9 , 26 , rushed him to @entity10 when the left side of his body went limp			1
his face dropped suddenly and he appeared to lose the use of his arm on september 7 this year			0
@entity7 , one , was rushed to @entity16 by his mother , @entity9 , 26 , when the left side of his body went limp and half of his face started to droop @entity9 and husband @entity19 , 29 , sped to the emergency department at @entity16 , @entity21 , where she explained @entity7 ’s symptoms to a doctor			1
but despite her telling staff her son looked ‘ like a stroke victim ’ , mrs @entity24 was assured a number of factors could have been responsible and was sent home with a leaflet on head injuries			1
after @entity7 continued to exhibit unusual behaviour and struggled to use his left arm , mrs @entity24 went back to hospital on september 12 and begged doctors for a second opinion			1
a series of tests confirmed mrs @entity24 ’s worst fears and doctors told her @entity7 had in fact suffered a stroke			1
the mother - of - one has since been told it was most probably triggered by a bout of @entity7 suffered in july			1
but even though research has previously shown a link between chickenpox and an increased risk of childhood strokes , mrs @entity24 said she was never asked if her son had suffered from the illness			1
@entity10 doctors at @entity16 sent @entity7 home with a leaflet about head injuries despite his mother explaining that she feared he had suffered a stroke since the stroke mrs @entity24 said @entity7 can no longer speak and suffers mobility issues			1
he now undergoes weekly physiotherapy and speech therapy in the hope of restoring his ability to speak and move around normally			2
however , doctors have said @entity7 - who also has cystic fibrosis - may never recover fully from his ordeal			1
mrs @entity24 , an account manager , is now demanding to know why a doctor missed her son ’s symptoms - leading to a delay in him receiving vital medication			1
she said : ‘ on the day it happened i noticed he was dragging his arm and it was shaking when he tried to pick things up			0
when @entity7 was still struggling to move his left arm , mrs @entity24 took him to a gp who referred him to a specialist			1
the specialist carried out tests which revealed he had had a stroke ‘ then he just stopped and looked at me and the left side of his face dropped - it looked like he was smirking but not in a natural way			1
‘ we sped up to @entity16 and we saw an @entity10 doctor but they made us feel as though we were over reacting , like we were wasting our time			1
‘ i just said to them he looked like he ’d had a stroke from the way his face dropped			2
‘ but they said it could be a number of factors and just gave me a leaflet on head injuries			0
mr and mrs @entity24 believe the stroke could have been brought on by a bout of chickenpox that @entity7 suffered two months earlier even though research has previously shown a link between chickenpox and an increased risk of childhood strokes , mrs @entity24 said she was never asked if her son had suffered from the illness ‘ we got home and we were trying to get @entity7 to use his arm but when we handed him a toy he would just cry with frustration , he could n’t reach out , so we knew something was n’t right			1
‘ after it did n’t improve we went to our gp who referred us to a specialist			2
‘ the neurologist ordered lots of different tests including @entity119 and mri scans			2
‘ later on she asked us to go into a private room and that ’s when we knew it was bad news			0
‘ when she told us he ’d had a stroke i got a bit angry , i asked how the doctor could have missed it			0
@entity7 , who also has cystic fibrosis , is now unable to speak and is still struggling to use his left arm			1
he is having physiotherapy and speech therapy but doctors are not sure he will ever fully recover ‘ i do feel like if @entity136 , as a person with no medical training , could spot the symptoms of a stroke then a doctor should have investigated it			2
’ mrs @entity24 said @entity7 , who could form basic words before the stroke , now struggles to speak at all			1
she added : ‘ part of the right side of his brain was starved of oxygen and died , he wo n’t ever get that back			0
‘ he ’s seeing a speech therapist but i ’ve noticed he ca n’t say little words like “ papa ” that he was starting to say before			0
‘ he struggles to get around sometimes because of his arm			0
mrs @entity24 said : ' part of the right side of his brain was starved of oxygen and died , he wo n't ever get that back ' ‘ it ’s like having a newborn again in some ways , it ’s like starting from scratch			1
‘ he is on so much medication already and now he has to take more to thin his blood because doctors do n’t know whether it will happen again			0
‘ he still seems happy in himself but it ’s terrifying for me and my husband			0
‘ we literally sit and watch him constantly because we ’re scared of it happening again			0
@entity7 now has to take blood thinning medication to prevent another stroke			2
he also takes medication for his cystic fibrosis			1
picture shows all of the medication he has to take every day ‘ even the slightest little thing now we think “ is he having another stroke ? ” ’ mr and mrs @entity24 are now seeking legal advice and have submitted a formal complaint to the @entity180 in charge of the hospital			1
@entity16 has launched an investigation into the case			2
a spokeswoman said : ‘ we can confirm that we have received a complaint from the family concerned			2
@entity16 says it has launched an investigation to establish what happened ‘ @entity16 takes all complaints extremely seriously and the @entity180 is undertaking a full investigation into the allegations made			2
‘ we are continuing to liaise with the mother of this child and will formally respond to her once the investigation is completed			0
’ @entity16 was hit by a scandal in 1999 after it emerged organs from hundreds of dead babies had been retained without permission			2
a stroke is a sudden disruption of the blood supply to the brain			0
it affects neurological functions such as movement and speech			0
there are two major types of stroke - ischaemic strokes which are caused by a blockage which prevents blood reaching an area of the brain , and haemorrhagic strokes which are caused by blood leaking from blood vessels into the brain			0
both cause damage to brain cells			0
every year about five out of every 100,000 children have a stroke			0
about half of these children have an underlying medical condition , such as a heart problem , which increases their risk of having a stroke			0
the other half are healthy before the stroke			0
one of the most common causes of strokes in these children is narrowing of the blood vessels in the head as a result of the chickenpox virus			0
this is a rare complication of chickenpox and it is not known why it happens			0
symptoms include weakness down one side of the body , balance problems , slurred speech and a droop on one side of the face			2

@entity7 , one , was rushed to @entity16 in @entity21 by his parents when the left side of his body went limp
@entity10 doctors said there could be many causes and sent him home
five days later , mrs @entity24 begged her gp for a second opinion
tests revealed @entity7 , who also has cystic fibrosis , had suffered a stroke
he can no longer speak and has mobility problems
the family are seeking legal advice and have submitted a formal complaint
