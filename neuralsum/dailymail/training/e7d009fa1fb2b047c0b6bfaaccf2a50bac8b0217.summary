' my feelings have been the same since that boy was murdered , ' @entity0 said backstage at @entity20 in @entity21 , where he 's a coach			1

before he was shot dead , @entity6 was caught on surveillance camera stealing a handful of cigarillos from a convenience store in @entity35 , @entity43 , and intimidating the shop owner			1
while @entity0 said that there was no excuse for officer @entity47 to use lethal force against the unarmed teen , he thinks @entity6 's actions were overlooked in the national discussion about the tragedy			1
' it looked very bully - ish ; that in itself i had a problem with , ' @entity0 told @entity38			1
' not with the kid , but with whatever happened in his life for him to arrive at a place where that behavior is ok			0
why are n't we talking about that ? ' @entity0 went on : ' the boy was walking in the middle of the street when the police supposedly told him to ' get the f * * * on the sidewalk			2
' if you do n't listen to that , after just having pushed a storeowner , you 're asking for trouble			0
' @entity0 declined to comment on monday about ongoing protests including school walkouts across the country			2
intimidating : police released this surveillance camera footage , reportedly showing @entity6 grabbing a convenience store owner shortly before he was stopped by officer @entity47 and shot dead on august 9 ' it 's not really about what i think			1
it 's about what you 're going to do			0
what are you going to do ? he 's a teen who is gone , ' @entity0 said			1

what are you going to do ? you understand what i 'm saying ? that 's why it hurts			0

one @entity96 user said : ' @entity101 was a bully says @entity0			1
so do we get a pass to shoot bullies in society ? way to go @entity0			1
' this is n't the first time that singer has started controversy over his opinions on race issues			0
in an interview with @entity114 last year , @entity0 angered some when he said ' the new black does n't blame others races for our issues '			2
@entity0 seemed hesitant to talk about race in the interview with the @entity122 monthly magazine , saying : ' i do n't talk about race since it takes a very open mind to hear my view , because my view is the sky view			2
but i 'm very troubled by what happened in @entity35 , @entity43			1

shooter @entity147 was controversially acquitted on any charges in the teen 's death			2
while his comments sparked a debate online , it 's clear that @entity0 feels a strong connection to the current situation in @entity35 , @entity43 , where protesters turned violent after hearing the grand jury 's decision on monday night			1
following the decision , @entity0 tweeted : ' i 'm heartbroken over the news of no indictment in @entity35			1
let 's all pray for peace '			0
he says he still believes racism exists , and that the situation in @entity35 may have been calmer if president @entity168 went there to show his support			2
' he did n't have to go and take a side ; all he needed to do was show his presence and everybody would have straightened up			0
but he did n't go			0
i wo n't fault him			0
' he 's a man with a lot of weight on his shoulders , but i personally would have gone because being a '' man of the people '' means you 're right there with them in it			0
@entity182 and @entity183 led by example			0
' @entity0 also made the strange decision to praise @entity186 during the interview , for the comedian 's history preaching tough love to black youth			2
the actor is currently under fire after at least 17 women have come forward to accuse him of rape			0
' i agree with him			0
when @entity186 said it back then , i understood ; i got it			0
listen , we have to look at ourselves and take action for ourselves			0
' @entity186 can talk that talk because he created @entity202 , he tried to buy @entity203 , he portrayed a doctor on @entity205 and had all of us wearing @entity207 sweaters			0
you 've got to respect him , ' @entity0 said			2
