@entity1 's @entity0 launched a late attack to win stage two of the @entity4 in @entity5 on sunday and claim the race leader 's yellow jersey			1
hundreds of thousands of people again lined the 201 - kilometre route from @entity10 on a brutal and unpredictable day of racing			0
@entity13 ( @entity12 ) , the 2013 @entity15 champion , left it late but timed his bid to the line to perfection to secure victory ahead of a number of his rivals for the overall title			0
he also claimed the race leader 's maillot jaune , from stage one winner @entity27 ( @entity28 ) , who endured a difficult day			2
the @entity81 was unchallenged until , within sight of the summit , defending champion @entity82 ( @entity83 ) stretched his legs			2
the descent saw and run - in saw numerous attempts to break off the front , all of which floundered until @entity0 burst clear inside the final 2km			0
the @entity1 champion , nicknamed the @entity95 , bared his teeth and led by 50metres under the flamme rouge at 1km to go and his rivals looked to each other to react			2
world champion @entity70 ( @entity71 ) led the pursuit , with @entity82 on his wheel , but the lack of a coordinated chase ensured @entity0 would win and he was able to celebrate a first tour stage win of his career			1
on their way : riders make their way past @entity112 at the start of the second stage of the @entity4 one for the album : fans take photos as the peloton passes @entity112 @entity64 @entity76 ( @entity61 ) was second , two seconds behind , with @entity43 ( @entity45 ) third			1
@entity67 was 13th and @entity120 19th , the @entity121 moving to fifth overall after his sixth - placed finish in @entity124 on day one			1
@entity126 's @entity125 relinquished the fabled yellow jersey without much of a defence on a challenging day for the sprinter in the @entity131 countryside			0
@entity27 had a day to forget , finishing well adrift , but will chase a sixth tour stage win in two editions in monday 's 155km third stage from @entity135 to @entity136 in @entity137			1
the second day of racing in @entity131 began with @entity139 ( @entity45 ) announcing his withdrawal following his crash in @entity124			2
no time for tea : the riders pass @entity145 tea rooms in @entity147 's square as they speed through @entity10 climb : the peloton ride up @entity149 in @entity150 as spectators strain for a goof view cobble challenge : the riders make their way up @entity149 in @entity150 , @entity131 favourite : @entity156 's @entity82 gets ready to race as thousands of fans watch on at @entity158 the @entity159 would not have relished a day as challenging as this , with nine categorised climbs to negotiate - five in the final 60km - and numerous more ascents in between			1
@entity163 ( @entity164 ) , @entity165 ( @entity74 ) , @entity166 ( @entity167 ) , @entity168 ( @entity169 ) , @entity170 ( @entity171 ) and @entity172 ( @entity41 ) initiated the day 's break before @entity174 ( @entity50 ) managed to latch on			0
the escapees were caught with just under 60km to go as the riders ascended @entity177 , the @entity4 's first category two climb			2
@entity172 broke clear and was pursued by @entity180 ( @entity164 ) as @entity125 slipped backwards			0
out of action : @entity139 has been forced to withdraw from @entity4 with a shoulder of injury the leader : @entity126 's @entity27 , wearing the yellow jersey , talks to compatriot @entity186 anticipation : spectators packed deep on each side on @entity190 in @entity10 await the start of the race making a dash : a breakaway group climb @entity195 , the longest continuous gradient in @entity197 at 5.5 miles away they go : the riders and support vehicles continue the slow climb of @entity195 @entity82 's chief lieutenant @entity202 punctured approaching the climb and was dragged back to the pack by @entity205 and @entity206 as @entity83 attempted to control the pace at the front of the peloton			1
@entity172 crested the summit first but the field came together on the @entity212 , with @entity125 more than five minutes adrift and his brief stay in the maillot jaune coming to an end			0
four more climbs were to follow , but the peloton stayed together to the summit of the penultimate climb when @entity220 ( @entity164 ) and @entity75 ( @entity41 ) surged clear			0
@entity75 was reluctant to work with his compatriot and was swept up before @entity220 's lone attempt to stay away ended with 8km to go			0
@entity80 came with just under 6km to go and that is where the race ignited			0
lead out : @entity48 's @entity46 ( left ) wearing the best young 's white jersey , @entity126 's @entity27 ( second left ) wearing the overall leader 's yellow jersey , @entity42 's @entity229 ( second right ) wearing the best sprinter 's green jersey , and @entity126 's @entity186 ( right ) wearing the best climber 's polka dot jersey , ride out of @entity158 tightly bunched : the peloton ride down @entity235 in @entity10 during the ceremonial opening to the second stage what a view ! the @entity4 general director @entity239 ( right ) and welcome to @entity131 chief executive @entity240 hitch a lift ahead of the riders flying the flag : crowds gather at @entity245 in @entity10 in anticipation of the riders coming past @entity247 : spectators line the balconies at @entity158 ahead of the start capture the moment : fans attempt to get a good shot of the riders as they pass by @entity255 played : this woman came prepared for the long wait for the riders to reach @entity177 in the @entity258 record breaker : @entity260 , the co-founder of the @entity262 brewing company puts the finishing touches to his attempt at the record for the world 's largest glass of beer			1
the glass holds 3,664 pints of @entity271 's gold ale , one pint for every kilometer of the @entity4 spicy : a group of fans dressed in @entity276 garb wait for the arrival of the cyclists spotty : some people in @entity280 were truly in the spirit of the occasion , painting polka dots on their house stunning : a view over @entity177 as spectators await the arrival of the riders party time : spectators in fancy dress form a conga line in the @entity294 village of @entity295 man in the mask : a fan with a @entity139 mask is given a lift while three cheering @entity301 look on			1
