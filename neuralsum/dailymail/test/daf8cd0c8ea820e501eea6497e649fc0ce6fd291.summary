' the celebrations in @entity26 will be echoed by other events across the country to mark @entity4 70 , with local authorities and communities encouraged to participate			1
' they will celebrate with members of their communities who contributed to the war effort throughout the @entity169			0
' the announcement of the @entity4 celebrations came after the @entity0 attended the traditional @entity172 in @entity173 yesterday			1
joined by the @entity83 , @entity174 , dressed in a turquoise coat by @entity176 and matching hat , was there to present ' alms ' to 89 women and 89 men , among them @entity183 veteran , @entity182			1
' it was just quick			0
i 'm not very good at hearing , ' said mr @entity182 , 91 , after the ceremony			0
' she did say something but i 'm not sure what it were			0
' handing out alms : the @entity0 presents a lady with the two @entity194 at @entity195 custom : monarchs have been presenting @entity198 since 1210 and @entity199 @entity174 , who had arrived on the @entity200 , was driven to the cathedral where she got a warm welcome from the flag - waving crowd and was presented with a nosegay of spring flowers			1
@entity207 at the church door by @entity209 , the @entity210 , and the local @entity211 , @entity212 , her majesty spoke briefly to the clergymen before being whisked inside for the service			1
after the hour - long service , the @entity0 posed for pictures with the @entity218 , who had lined the cathedral 's aisles during the ceremony			1
the royal party then left for a reception at @entity225 as the recipients emerged into the sunshine , all pleased with their royal acknowledgement			0
@entity229 , 72 , said : ' it was brilliant , absolutely wonderful			0
when i got here the atmosphere was tremendous			0
' the @entity172 is one of the @entity97 's oldest royal customs and sees the monarch distribute alms in the shape of two purses of specially minted coins			2
this year , the @entity240 contains a £ 5 coin , commemorating the 50th anniversary of the death of @entity58 and a 50p coin commemorating the 75th anniversary of the @entity121			2
commemorative : the red and white bags contain commemorative coins , this year featuring @entity58 tradition : the @entity0 and prince @entity83 were handed traditional nosegays made from spring flowers historically , this sum of £ 5.50 in the @entity240 is made up of £ 3 for clothing , £ 1.50 in lieu of provisions and £ 1 for the redemption of the @entity258 's gown			1
the @entity259 contains uniquely minted @entity198 , which , unlike coins in general circulation , bear the portrait of the queen produced by @entity264 at the start of her reign			2
@entity264 , a sculptor , designed the portrait which appeared on the coins of the @entity97 and some @entity95 countries from 1953 until preparations for decimalisation began in 1968			0
the portrait of the @entity0 wearing a wreath on her head was considered to reflect the nation 's optimism as it greeted a new monarch in the post-war years			2
the @entity198 is an ancient ceremony which has its origin in the commandment @entity282 gave after washing the feet of his disciples the day before @entity285			2
warm welcome : the queen is greeted at @entity195 ahead of the traditional @entity172 @entity288 : the @entity83 was on jolly form as he arrived for the service in an echo of the @entity293 , mediaeval and @entity294 monarchs also washed the feet of beggars during the service			2
unlike the nosegay , which was originally introduced as a means of disguising the repellent smell , that custom failed to survive the 18th century			0
the first monarch to take part in a maundy thursday service was @entity199 , of @entity305 and @entity307 fame , who distributed gifts of clothes and money to the poor in @entity312 in 1210			2
@entity199 was also the first to present the poor with silver coins and is recorded as having done so in @entity315 in 1213			0
@entity199 's grandson @entity316 , the king known to posterity as ' the @entity318 ' , was the first to confine the tradition to @entity320 alone , which , until his reign , could be conducted on any day of the year			0
long wait : many of the well - wishers outside the @entity195 had waited there for hours @entity325 : the 800 - year - old tradition used to involve washing beggars ' feet - hence the nosegay all smiles : @entity174 , who has only missed the ceremony four times , was all smiles as she arrived smell : the scented nosegays were originally used to disguise the stench of unwashed people			0
