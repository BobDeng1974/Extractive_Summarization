by @entity0 published : 07:07 est , 25 june 2012 updated : 08:04 est , 25 june 2012 a 17 - year - old girl with a rare aggressive cancer was left undiagnosed for six months after doctors mistook her symptoms for ' typical teenager laziness			1
' a scan revealed @entity7 had a large tumour at the base of her brain and her mother @entity11 , 36 , was told she only had a 10 per cent chance of survival			1
her condition was so serious she was christened in hospital and her mother and stepfather @entity17 rushed through an adoption process so that @entity7 could officially call him ' dad '			1
now her family are celebrating after @entity7 finally began responding to the treatment			1
she is well enough to return to school although it will be four years before she is officially in remission			2
@entity7 at home in @entity25 with her mother @entity26 and father @entity27			1
@entity7 has returned to school mr @entity17 , 28 , said : ' we always said that one day i would adopt @entity7 but her being so ill made us get the ball rolling			1
' i am so proud to be her father officially , and not just because she has been so brave , but because she is a wonderful girl and any father would be proud to call her his daughter			2
' i was always there for her anyway , but now whatever the future holds she knows she has a dad to turn to			0
' @entity7 was just 16 when her mother first noticed she was unwell in october 2010			1
@entity26 said : ‘ i know all teenagers like to sleep but @entity7 was exhausted all the time			1
she would fall asleep straight after school			2
' she used to love shopping and ice skating with her friends but she could barely keep her eyes open to finish her tea			0
’ @entity26 took her daughter to see their gp but was told @entity7 was suffering from nothing more than typical teenage laziness			1
@entity7 back at home after treatment : @entity27 shaved his hair off to make her feel better @entity7 , pictured at her christening service held in royal @entity56			1
her weight plummeted during treatment @entity7 said : ‘ they just said i was a typical teenager and teenagers needed lots of sleep and not to worry			1
’ unconvinced , they returned twice with the same concern only to be told the same thing and @entity7 was prescribed iron tablets as they said she could be anaemic			1
it was only in march 2011 six months after first visiting her gp when @entity7 fell down the stairs in a sleepy daze and her mum rushed her to hospital that doctors discovered the awful truth			1
an mri scan showed a large tumour at the base of her brain and @entity7 ’s mother was told she had a very rare form of childhood cancer called @entity83			1
there are only a handful of cases diagnosed in the @entity87 each year and around 30 in the @entity88 doctors explained it was one of the fastest growing tumours with the main symptom being tiredness and lethargy			1
‘ i was shaking when they told me she only had a ten per cent chance of survival			0
for months we ’d been told she was just a typical teenager and then we ’re told she might not pull through			0
’ @entity26 went to her daughter ’s bedside at the @entity102			0
‘ i told her how poorly she was but she already knew			0
i could n’t help breaking down as i held her			0
’ two days on @entity7 was taken to theatre for surgery to remove the tumour			1
but surgeons had to abandon the operation because it was too close to her brain stem			2
devastatingly tests showed three more tumours the size of peas dotted down her spinal cord			0
they were also too dangerous to remove so @entity7 would need to start intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy			1
her condition was so serious @entity7 with her mother @entity26 before she became ill. doctors thought she had anaemia recovering : @entity7 at a charity event at @entity123 's @entity122 with her father @entity27 and brother @entity124 @entity26 was advised to get her daughter baptised by the hospital chaplain			1
the ceremony took place in may last year			0
as her weight plummeted from seven stone to four stone and she was tube fed and @entity26 and @entity17 spent every day at her bedside			0
@entity17 even gave up his job as a plasterer to be with her every day			0
when her hair fell out devoted @entity17 shaved his off too to make her feel better			0
@entity17 also started fundraising and took @entity139 in her wheelchair to keep her spirits up			0
it was from her hospital bed shortly after she was baptised that @entity7 asked @entity17 to adopt her			2
he said : ‘ i was already her dad but @entity7 wanted to make it official			2
‘ the next day we contacted social services and told them we needed their help quickly			0
’ they agreed to rush it through as quickly as possible and a few weeks on all the forms arrived			0
the family went through several rounds of interviews before they received a date for the court hearing earlier this year			0
unfortunately @entity7 was too sick to attend but @entity17 and @entity26 rushed straight to her hospital bedside once it was made official in march this year			2
family matters : @entity7 at home with her parents , half - brother @entity124 and half - sister @entity165 over the next few months @entity7 fought hard against the cancer and her family were thrilled when doctors said recently she was finally showing signs of responding to treatment against all the odds			1
it will be another four years until she is in remission but @entity7 ’s just pleased her hair has started growing back			2
@entity26 said : ‘ she is so strong and we are so proud			0
she ’s always been a daddy ’s girl but now it ’s official			0
‘ we want other parents to know the signs of this awful cancer because early diagnosis is crucial			2
‘ we were told she was just being a typical teenager when she was desperately ill with cancer			2
we could have lost her			0
thank @entity184 we did n’t			0
