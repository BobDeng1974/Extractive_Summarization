@entity0 insists @entity2 ’s young lions are ready for their biggest test yet after they avoided a nightmare @entity6 play - off draw			1
@entity2 were paired with @entity7 in friday afternoon ’s draw in @entity9 and will play the first leg at @entity11 ’ @entity13 home next month , most likely to be on friday , october 10 , before travelling to the @entity14 the following week			1
there were worries that @entity2 would be handed a return to @entity18 , two years after several young @entity2 players were racially abused , or given a trip to @entity21 but those concerns were to no avail			1
@entity0 's @entity24 will play @entity7 in the @entity25 play - off round @entity27 opens the scoring for @entity2 in their qualifier with @entity30 at stadium : mk @entity0 , however , is adamant this will be a searching examination			1
@entity7 finished top of @entity35 , with 19 points from their eight games , whereas @entity2 topped @entity38 after taking 28 points from a possible 30 and winning eight matches in succession			1
‘ they were the winners of a tough group and they won all their away games , so we have no doubt that this is going to be another significant step up for us , ’ @entity0 told @entity42			2
‘ when i looked at the draw in its entirety , i could not see a fixture that looked “ easy ” and this is clearly going to be a challenge for us			0
‘ when i left ( for @entity56 ) this morning , people were saying to me “ good luck ” but i could n’t understand whether they meant with a short trip or something like that – we were certainly not going to get a simple game , that ’s for sure			0
‘ only seven teams can get there ( to the finals ) so that is always going to make it a real jeopardy game			2
but it is crucial for their development to feel this pressure and this tension			0
‘ but we are going to go there with a lot of confidence and if we play with the style that we have done , and the lads keep making progress , we know we can travel with confidence			0
’ @entity81 scored the winner as @entity2 defeated @entity83 at the @entity84 in @entity85 as for returning to the @entity14 , @entity0 has no concerns at all about the environment @entity2 will be heading in to			2
the venue for the second leg is yet to be selected – the @entity91 @entity90 are still in discussions with the @entity90 – but @entity0 is confident it will be safe and secure , as opposed to the conditions that were presented to @entity2 when they faced @entity18 in @entity94			1
‘ i have got absolutely no worries at all about taking the team out there , ’ said @entity0			0
‘ it is a lovely part of the world and i know from working with players like @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103 that the people are friendly			0
‘ it will be a nice place to visit but it will be a difficult match against a side that is technically excellent			0
but this is a process that we are going to have to get through ; they are the experiences we want these boys to have			0
’ @entity111 vs @entity112 @entity113 vs @entity114 @entity115 vs @entity116 @entity2 vs @entity7 @entity117 vs @entity118 @entity21 vs @entity119 @entity18 vs @entity120 tie to be played over two legs , between october 8 and 14 .			1
