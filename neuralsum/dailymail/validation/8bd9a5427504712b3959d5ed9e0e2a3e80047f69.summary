after a blistering start , @entity0 were forced to work for their win against @entity3 , which took them level on points with @entity7 and @entity8 at the top of the @entity11 championship table			1
@entity12 had @entity14 's side ahead inside five minutes , but @entity3 fought back and forced a thrilling finale			1
@entity17 's @entity16 was there to run the rule over the two teams : @entity21 gets up above @entity22 to secure line - out ball for @entity0 in a hard - fought battle @entity0 @entity25 – ominous when he dropped first high kick but settled well and posed a threat whenever he had the ball			1
@entity29 – a game of near - triumph for him , but he scored a ‘ try ’ which was ruled out , as was another he helped set up			2
@entity25 takes on @entity34 as the @entity0 full back looked to create opportunities @entity12 – took his try with typical , swerving aplomb , to showcase his nifty footwork			1
held up well in defence			2
@entity41 – squandered glorious early scoring chance			2
forceful as ever , but not igniting this campaign as he did last year			2
@entity45 – @entity47 wing was electric with his broken - field running			2
some suspect decision - making but good finish for try			2
@entity12 dives over to score @entity0 's early try , which looked to have set them on their way @entity56 – his authority grows			1
created openings with distribution and pace , and scored a try			2
all was well until late missed kicks			2
@entity63 – was a livewire threat early on and continued to test the @entity66 defence with his darts around the fringes			2
@entity70 – deft handling in run - up to @entity73 try , put in familiar busy shift in defence and was at the heart of set - piece onslaught			2
@entity56 dives over the line for his try in a game where he contributed 15 points and controlled the play @entity83 – this was a fast - and - loose encounter , so his work in the tight was most felt with his part in a first - half scrum blitz			1
@entity90 – the @entity92 tighthead is quite content to win scrums and hit rucks , in which case he was in his element here			1
@entity98 – not as prominent as he was in @entity99 , when his defensive work was so valuable and not among top carriers			1
@entity98 gets the ball away out of the tackle as @entity0 in another good display from the second row @entity21 – largely effective in the way he orchestrated the lineout and a dynamic , punishing presence around the field			1
@entity111 – made his fair share of tackles but no major carrying or breakdown impact			1
his place may be under threat			0
@entity117 – determination to impose himself was clear from sheer number of times he pounded the @entity66 defence			0
@entity117 goes on one of his characteristic runs as he offers @entity0 some momentum @entity127 – not a towering presence before the break , but more influential later , especially as a link - man in attacks			1
replacements : @entity133 exploded from the bench to provide impetus and fellow front - rower , @entity137 , was involved in the build - up to @entity45 ’s try and @entity140 made one strong late burst			1
@entity127 needs two @entity66 tacklers to bring him down as he led @entity0 to a @entity144 victory @entity3 @entity145 – did well to chase back and prevent a try by @entity25			1
frustrated by restricted chances and threw some wild passes			1
@entity149 – had a couple of jinking bursts but largely well shackled			0
covered effectively when @entity29 threatened in second half			0
@entity145 goes low to bring down @entity45 but @entity3 could n't hold out for long @entity153 – kept his head when the chance came ; ignoring men outside to touch down			0
@entity157 – was an emergency replacement for @entity159 and this was n’t a day for him to prove his creative credentials			0
@entity162 – a regular threat			0
he came in - field looking for work and often found gaps			1
@entity34 – was all at sea in the first quarter but grew into the game			0
some shrewd touches but also some glaring lapses			0
@entity34 looks for territory as the @entity66 struggled to get good field position to make a late charge @entity175 – behind a beaten pack , he struggled to control proceedings and did n’t challenge @entity0 with box - kicks			1
@entity179 – the prop was damned by association with a scrum effort which was hapless as @entity0 took command			1
@entity184 – he has had far more commanding outings than this , as he failed to make many dents in a pack on the back foot			0
@entity190 – after early tussle with @entity90 , was left flailing as @entity56 scored his try and could n’t prevent scrum rout			0
@entity175 kicks clear as @entity21 attempts to get through two @entity66 forwards to charge down @entity196 – it was n’t his day			0
took a blow to the head that led to an early exit and not the usual snarling menace			0
@entity22 – nearly touched down when the @entity66 finally gained a foothold			0
could n’t disrupt @entity204 supply at the lineout			0
@entity206 – had a hand in the try scored by @entity153 but against the big , strong home forwards he was a lightweight presence			0
@entity211 – last year , he was almost a lone threat to @entity0 and this time he again fought the good fight in vain			1
@entity22 carries the ball as @entity3 fought back from a poor start to make a game of it @entity219 – aside from one slick aerial off - load to send @entity221 hurtling clear , he was a low - profile figure in this game			0
replacements : the lack of @entity66 depth was harshly exposed			0
none of them sent on from the bench by @entity230 could do anything to turn the tide against their team .			0

@entity0 create *countless* chances but made to work hard for win
result takes @entity0 top of @entity11 table on points *difference*
@entity244 picked up 15 points as @entity0 retained @entity144
