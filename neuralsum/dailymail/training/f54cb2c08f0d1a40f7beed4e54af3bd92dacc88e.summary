by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 19:43 est , 24 may 2013 updated : 23:00 est , 24 may 2013 @entity2 has denied spending nearly $ 2million on a topless painting of the @entity6 actress @entity5 after his comedian friend posted a picture of himself holding the portrait and thanking @entity2 for the ' generous ' gift			1
' biggest surprise of my life			0
thank you @ jimmykimmel - the most generous guy in the world ! # @entity18 , ' comedian @entity14 wrote as the picture caption			1
while he did not formally confirm that he was the one to pay the pricey sum for the picture , @entity2 's response comes as a certain declaration - one that he ultimately overturned			1
@entity14 posed for a picture with ' the biggest surprise of his life ' , the nude portrait of @entity5 that he said @entity2 bought for him as a surprise confirmation ? @entity2 seemingly declared that he had sent the painting to his friend and fellow comedian denial : @entity2 claimed the whole thing was a joke ' @entity5 is watching over all of us , but especially you , ' @entity2 wrote			1
later friday night , @entity2 came back clearing things up by saying that he had nothing to do it with			2

back in the day : @entity2 and @entity14 have been friends for many years , seen here in 2000 while the entire situation seemed like one of @entity50 's made - for - late - night pranks from the beginning , the history between @entity14 and @entity46 added an element of validity to the story			1
@entity14 has worked with @entity55 for years , and one of his duties was hosting the channel 's annual roasts of big stars			1
in 1999 , he was the emcee at the roast honoring @entity61 , and @entity61 's good friend @entity5 was in the audience			2
at one point during the ceremony , @entity14 made a lewd joke at @entity46 's expense , and she took it in stride , glaring back at him for an extra laugh			1
' she gave me this hilarious stare , this stink - eye that made — let ’s face it — an ok joke into a great moment , a great roast moment , ' @entity14 said in an interview for the @entity79 blog			1
' and then over time , i felt like she put me on the map because everywhere i went people were quoting this joke to me			0
i ’m hearing it all the time , it ’s quoted in newspapers at the end of the year , it was part of all these roundups of the greatest lines of the year , and i ’m realizing that i ’m sort of getting a boost from this ridiculous joke that ’s not even that funny			0
' he said that as his name became more and more associated with @entity46 's , he felt indebted to her and attended one of her one - woman shows			2
at the end of the performance , he waited in line to say hello to her and she immediately recognized him			0
' she just stuck a finger right in my face and said , " you nailed me , you prick ! " and we both laughed and she gave me a hug			0
it was really cool knowing what a fun broad she was , ' he said			0
big moment : @entity14 ( left ) made a joke at @entity46 's expense at a @entity55 roast in 1999 , and she was a good sport about it , playing along with it for the cameras ( right ) controversial artist @entity122 painted ‘ @entity127 ’ in 1991 , and it features the elderly star wearing a blank expression and sagging breasts			2

others have since argued it is actually a feminist statement about confidence and age			0
