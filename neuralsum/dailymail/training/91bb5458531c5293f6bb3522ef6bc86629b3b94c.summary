in fact @entity3 teenagers find their fathers so embarrassing that they stay an average of 6.7 metres away from them if they are out together in public , for fear of being seen by friends			1
but maybe the kids should be more grateful as it transpires that the average father also does 627 ‘ dad miles ’ every year on weekends , ferrying teens to and from parties and other social gatherings , often very late into the evening			1
@entity3 teens implement a 6.7m exclusion zone for fear of being seen by friends in public with their dads one west @entity25 father of four , @entity24 , said that he had taken to answering the phone ' @entity27 ' after 10pm on friday and saturday nights in the certain knowledge that it would be a request for a lift from one of his teenage kids			1
@entity24 said : ' i have noticed that my teenage kids tend to keep their distance when we ’re out and about			2
fathers are still embarrassing their offspring in much the same manner as also ' i do n’t take it personally because i remember doing it myself from time to time , as we all do			2
