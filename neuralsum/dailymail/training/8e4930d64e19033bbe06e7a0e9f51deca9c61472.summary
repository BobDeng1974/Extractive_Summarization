police officers who were chasing two illegal immigrants near the @entity4 - @entity3 border were stunned when they stumbled across a marijuana farm spread across two acres of prime land			1
the officers had been pursuing the illegal immigrants about 15 miles southwest of @entity9 in @entity10			1
but they got much more than they bargained for when they stumbled across a farm with rows of 8 - foot tall marijuana plants just 25 miles from the @entity4 - @entity3 border on the @entity10 side			1
maintenance : long irrigated rows that once held 11,500 marijuana plants are spread over two acres near @entity9 , @entity10 @entity22 sheriff @entity21 said : ' i have n't seen anything like this			1
i 've seen where guys would hollow out a place in the brush in their backyard or something close to their house , just a little bit			0
' but this was quite spread out and dense and most of them were already pretty high			0
' the farm had once been used to grow watermelons and grain			1
the farm was well tended too and had white pipes and a pump diverting water from a canal which delivered to the 60 - foot long rows by carefully excavated trenches			1
@entity45 , @entity46 deputy special agent in charge of @entity48 and the @entity49 , was shocked by the quality of the irrigation system			2
he said he had n't encountered something like this in his 17 years in the area			0
mr @entity45 said : ' i guess we should n't be surprised by how well it was done considering it 's the @entity49 and people down there are very experienced in irrigation and just growing ( fruits and vegetables ) in general			2
' every year , tons of marijuana crosses the border daily from @entity3 and large - scale growing operations are routinely found			1
last month , authorities dismantled a massive pot farm in the woods about 70 miles northeast of @entity71 that yielded 100,000 plants			1
but such a large crop so close to the border is unheard of , according to authorities			2
water : a section of pipe that was used to irrigate a two - acre marijuana farm is hidden in the brush derelict : an abandoned milking barn where immigrants were being held is located on the pot farm @entity85 : rotten foam covers the floor of an abandoned milking barn where immigrants had been held near @entity9 , @entity10 the 11,500 - plant farm was located nearly a mile from a paved road , on an old dairy farm long left to its own devices			1
a well - kept citrus grove sat across the dirt road , and horses browsed in a pasture nearby			2
the marijuana was on the back portion of the overgrown parcel and authorities had to plow a road in just to access it			0
adjacent to the field of pot were small shelters which were carefully camouflaged with branches			0
officers found an empty case of instant noodles , scattered egg shells and a 50 - pound bag of fertilizer in them			2
nearby , a large black plastic tarp could be unfurled for shade - most likely for the immigrant pot farm workers			1
according to police , the crop 's owners would have soon brought in another valuable harvest of a dozen immigrants if they were n't rumbled by officers who ran straight into the pot farm on august 13			1
the night before , a man dialed 911 and claimed that he had been held , beaten and threatened in a stash house for three weeks			0
he tried to lead sheriff 's deputies back to the spot , but could n't find it in the dark			0
authorities returned in the daylight and found more than they bargained for when they pursued the immigrants down twisting paths			0
according to police , the man and other immigrants were likely forced to care for the marijuana plants , as three weeks is an unusually long time to be held in a stash house			1
three men were arrested on immigrant harboring charges , but prosecutors dropped cases against two of them earlier this week and the third waived his preliminary hearing in federal court			0
miracle grow : an empty fertilizer bag is left behind at the two - acre pot farm no one has been charged yet in the pot growing operation			1
but an investigation is underway by @entity155			2
however , it is still too early to know why the location was selected			0
local farmer @entity158 of @entity159 has his own theory			0
he said that the owners of the pot farm probably used that piece of land because they had more security on the border			1
he believes that they grew the weed close to the border to able to cross over with it			0
mr @entity158 had not farmed that parcel of his family 's land since 1996			0
he has another 40 acres next door and has told @entity175 before that he suspected immigrants were passing through the land because he found water bottles , food cans and backpacks			2
last year , the @entity181 , in which local and federal law enforcement agencies participate , eradicated 147,277 outdoor cultivated plants in 24 separate seizures .			0

the land was located near the @entity4 @entity3 border in @entity10 and was once used to grow watermelons and grain
stunned officers discovered 8 - foot tall marijuana plants on the pot farm which had a sophisticated irrigation system rigged up to it
police said that illegal immigrants were probably used to work and look after the pot farm
an investigation is underway , but no one has been charged yet in the pot growing operation
