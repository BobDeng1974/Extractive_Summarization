a town is ‘ under siege ’ from travellers who have set up 79 illegal camps in a year			1
caravans have been parked on verges , roundabouts , cycle tracks and school grounds in @entity9 , @entity10			1

with police on their way , the headteacher persuaded the group to move on			0

that bill is now estimated to have passed £ 50,000			0
yesterday , local @entity45 mp @entity44 said : ‘ residents have been living under siege , in fear and misery for the past year			2
it ’s shocking that this is allowed			0
’ the camps have ranged in size from one caravan to more than 30 , and may last a few days – or several weeks			2
sometimes the group move of their own accord , and sometimes they are moved on , only to find another spot close by			0
mr @entity44 said they were ‘ holding a gun to the council ’s head ’ in an attempt to get a legal permanent site			1
he wants a change in the law to make it a criminal offence to set up an illegal camp			0
last night mother - of - eight @entity71 , wife of the travellers ’ leader @entity70 , 47 , said : ‘ we ’ve been served a notice to move on – we ’ll leave this camp but we wo n’t leave @entity9			1
‘ our kids are all booked into local schools so we wo n’t be leaving			0
we ’ve got nowhere else to go			0
’ she added that the group hoped to win a legal camp			2
‘ there ’s already two @entity83 shops in the town and they ’re building a third – if they had a choice why would they not give it to the traveller people ? ’ locals say 70 sites have appeared in the town in the last year , but little has been done to tackle the issue locals have complained of litter and safety concerns , but travellers insist they are merely waiting for legal plots to be made available mrs @entity71 said they came to @entity9 in october 2013 after being evicted from land they purchased in nearby @entity97			1
section 61 of the @entity99 allows police to force trespassers to leave if they have more than six vehicles , damage land or use threatening words or behaviour			0

more than 2,000 @entity9 residents have signed an e-petition calling for official action			1
a resident wrote online : ‘ travellers feel they have the right to intimidate people for using public footpaths that they have decided to set up camp by			2
why should these people have more rights than those who abide by the law ? ’ the town is less than 30 miles from the @entity124 camp , which was cleared out following legal action in 2011 @entity9 has two legal traveller sites with a total of 44 pitches , but there is not enough room for the newcomers			1
council officials have started a day - by - day diary to keep up with the group as they move from one illegal camp to another			0
it shows all 79 encampments and how many caravans were at each			2
yesterday ’s entry states there are now three illegal camps in @entity9			1
the largest , 21 caravans , sits on a cycle track owned by @entity146			2
two caravans are in a @entity149 car park , and nine on private land near a social club			2
@entity153 visited the cycle track yesterday and gave the group a deadline of 9am today to leave			0
the travellers are said to split into smaller groups so councils have to take out more eviction notices			0
@entity160 said it is taking action to protect its land and a possession hearing is due to take place next week			0
it has written to the government calling for new laws to end the ‘ expensive and disruptive cat - and - mouse game where travellers merely move from one site to another ’			1
council leader @entity173 said the ‘ balance ’ between travellers ’ and residents ’ rights needed to be reviewed , adding : ‘ we are doing everything we legally can			1
’ chief superintendent @entity179 , of @entity10 police , said the force would ‘ not hesitate to serve @entity182 notices ’ where possible			1
he said a number had been served , but added that police can not stop camps forming : ‘ we can only use this power if it is lawful , necessary and proportionate			1
’ @entity9 is 29 miles from @entity124 , @entity189 ’s most notorious illegal camp until it was dismantled after violent confrontation with bailiffs and riot police			1
the eviction , after a ten - year stand - off at the site near @entity196 , cost £ 7million .			0

caravans have been placed on grass verges and parks in @entity9 , @entity10
