he grew up harbouring hopes of shining amid a galaxy of stars at @entity5			1
@entity8 ’s @entity7 dreams soon came crashing back to earth , but the forward has certainly found his wings again with @entity12			1
the former @entity14 striker , who is aiming to floor @entity15 in the @entity16 at @entity17 on thursday , can claim to be the only striker in @entity19 to have outscored @entity21 icon @entity20 at club level so far in 2014			1
@entity8 failed to make the grade at @entity5 but has found his form at @entity12 @entity8 has netted 53 goals for the @entity27 side to @entity20 ’s 49			1
last season , he finished fifth in the @entity30 rankings , behind @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity20			1
@entity8 is currently revelling in his duel with the holder of the @entity36 , although he admits it is a battle he can not win			2
‘ being ( in contention ) with @entity20 is nice and i want to enjoy it , ’ said @entity8 recently			1
‘ but fighting for the @entity40 is difficult , i do n’t think about that			0
in @entity27 , each goal counts for less ( than goals scored in @entity44 ) , so i ’d have to score lots and lots more to win			2
’ @entity8 ’s numbers are certainly impressive			2
in 15 @entity16 matches , he has scored 16 goals ; an average of one every 77 minutes			2
in all matches this season , the 29 - year - old has scored 28 in 26 games ; a goal every 75 minutes			0
in less than two years , he has accumulated a staggering 110 goals for @entity12 , including 11 in last year ’s @entity16 , finishing top scorer in the competition			1
@entity15 goalkeeper @entity59 , who picked a @entity8 free - kick out of his net in the 2 - 2 draw in @entity27 , has already pinpointed the @entity63 as the biggest danger to his side ’s hopes of reaching the last 32			1
the @entity68 forward has scored 16 goals in 15 @entity16 matches - that 's one every 77 minutes ‘ he is very good , ’ said the @entity71 1 , who hopes to wrap up qualification before a tricky final - day tie away to rivals @entity75			1
‘ not just his free - kick , his all - round play was very good			0
he ’s very dangerous and we ’ll need to try to stop him			0
’ @entity8 has certainly attracted attention			2
after his hat - trick in a 5 - 1 @entity83 win away at @entity75 , @entity81 international manager @entity80 said : ‘ if @entity8 had speed he would still be at @entity5 as their starting centre - forward			1
’ yet while the @entity12 striker ’s stats make for frightening reading , @entity88 ’s @entity68 football expert @entity87 is not convinced			2
while evidently too good to play in @entity27 and a proven @entity16 predator , former @entity93 and @entity94 star @entity87 believes @entity8 is at @entity12 for a reason : he has found his level , and @entity20 he is not			1
@entity15 and @entity97 goalkeeper @entity59 described @entity8 as ' very dangerous ' ‘ he ’s a very skilful player but there are dozens of @entity103 in @entity44 , ’ said @entity87 , who famously scored the only goal of the game for @entity93 against hosts @entity44 at the 1982 @entity101			1
‘ i honestly see dozens of players like him all season			0
i was at the @entity107 against @entity109 game at the weekend and it was 1 - 1 when a guy came off the bench for @entity109 called @entity112			0
‘ @entity113 was on the park one minute when he ran at a couple of defenders , stepped over the ball twice and cracked in a spectacular winner from 30 yards			0
‘ that ’s just what they produce over in @entity44			0
excellent forwards with great technique and goalscoring prowess , like @entity8			2
‘ but , at @entity5 , you ’ve got rapid players at another level like @entity128 , @entity129 and @entity33			2
‘ they ’ve had to loan @entity130 out , who is a terrific player and a flying machine			0
@entity133 , who was at @entity134 last season , ca n’t — and wo n’t — get in the @entity14 team either and he ’s no slouch			0
@entity138 , who is now at @entity139 , also had plenty pace and skill			0
@entity8 is the only player to have scored more goals than @entity21 star @entity20 in 2014 ‘ so @entity14 have lots of top quality and speedy players and the simple reason @entity8 is not there any more is because , good player that he is , he ’s not good enough for @entity14			1
‘ it ’s one thing being able to do it in @entity27 and another thing to be able to do it in @entity44 , or at @entity17 in front of a large and hostile crowd for that matter			0
’ @entity8 ’s former @entity14 striking partner @entity158 , now at @entity159 , was recently called into the full @entity44 side at the age of 28			0
at just one year his elder , @entity8 has also been tipped in some quarters for a late first full @entity44 cap , but @entity87 does not believe that is likely			0
he added : ‘ but if you are scoring goals , you are a danger and @entity8 ’s definitely got great pace and great technique			1
‘ if he gets in a one - on - one situation @entity15 are in trouble			0
‘ but i ’ve watched @entity15 a few times this season and it seems to me they are improving all the time			0
‘ and if @entity15 and @entity175 do their homework on @entity8 , then i ’m sure they will be fine and they will get the result they need to go through			1
’ @entity8 will be setting his sights on @entity15 on thursday in their @entity16 clash at @entity17			1

@entity8 has scored more goals than @entity20 in 2014
the former @entity5 forward currently plays for @entity12
@entity8 and his club will take on @entity15 on thursday night at @entity17
