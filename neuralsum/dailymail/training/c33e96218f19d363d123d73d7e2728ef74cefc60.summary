by @entity0 published : 11:59 est , 24 april 2013 updated : 13:08 est , 24 april 2013 @entity1 has unveiled the phone it hopes has one feature to differentiate it from the touchscreen competition - a qwerty keyboard			1
the @entity6 will be available in the @entity7 next week for £ 579 , although is expected to be subsidised by major operators , and in the @entity9 next month			2
many say the handset is @entity1 's last chance after the touchscreen version of the phone , called the @entity15 , failed to sell as well as the firm hoped			1
although the @entity27 has fallen behind rivals , many ' power ' users have stayed loyal because they prefer a physical keyboard over the touch screen on the @entity51 and most @entity60 devices			1
however , the initial reviews of the handset are not encouraging			1
' anyone who does n't need a physical keyboard should skip it , ' said @entity66 , while @entity67 said ' for most buyers , though , it 's going to feel like a throwback , and we do n't mean that in a good way			1
' in the @entity7 , @entity73 will exclusively launch the new and highly anticipated @entity6 in all its stores and online on friday 26th april			0
in a @entity78 exclusive , @entity73 and @entity76 will be the only place in @entity78 to purchase the @entity6 , for £ 579.99 , in store and online until monday 29th , when it will then be available nationwide			0
@entity27 chief executive @entity83 with the firm 's two handset , the @entity15 touchscreen , left , and the @entity6 with a keyboard ( right ) @entity88 , @entity89 at @entity73 said : ' following the very successful @entity15 launch we are thrilled to be hosting the @entity92 of the highly anticipated @entity6			1
' this is the product all core @entity27 users have been waiting for			2
we pride ourselves in being the destination for all the latest gadgets and technology and @entity27 is no exception '			0
@entity1 is bullish about the handset 's chances			1
' built with precision and offering premium performance in a timeless design , the @entity6 smartphone combines @entity27 ’s best physical keyboard and a touch screen with the power of the @entity27 platform , ' it says			2
@entity27 chief executive @entity83 believes the handsets will beat the @entity51 , which makes up 38 % of the installed base of smartphones in the @entity9 , against 5.9 % for @entity27 , @entity83 told the @entity112 agency that @entity113 lacked innovation and that the phone could not multitask : ' it 's still the same , ' @entity83 said of the @entity51			0
' it is a sequential way to work and that 's not what people want today anymore			0
' the @entity6 , the handset experts hope will save the firm as it battles @entity113 and @entity53 ' the @entity6 is , for the most part , exactly what we expected it to be : a @entity15 with a smaller display and a physical keyboard			1
the @entity6 is unquestionably the best phone with a keyboard on the market			2
however , given how weak the competition and demand there has become , we 're not sure cornering that market will move the needle very far in @entity27 's favor			0
@entity140 ' the @entity6 is a great phone for @entity142 diehards and e-mail addicts , but anyone who does n't need a physical keyboard should skip it			1
' @entity66 the @entity6 is the one you ’ll see clenched in the fists of type - a personalities in @entity150 suits as they race through airports , chase down taxis , and eagerly await their skim lattes			0
these are the @entity27 elite , and they are going to love this phone as soon as their it department tells them it ’s ok to			0
but if you ’re not the typing type , and especially if you live for your apps and your photos , you ’re better off sticking to the black rectangles with the bigger screens			0
@entity162 ' the @entity6 is a very solid and well - built little phone , and it 's one of the few options available from any smartphone ecosystem for the physical keyboard holdouts			2
for most buyers , though , it 's going to feel like a throwback , and we do n't mean that in a good way			0

handset has both keyboard and a touchscreen
@entity1 hopes it will appeal to ' *hardcore* ' users of previous versions
first reviews *advise* customers to ' skip it '
