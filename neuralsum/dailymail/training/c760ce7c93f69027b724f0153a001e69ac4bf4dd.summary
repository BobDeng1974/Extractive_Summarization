injured : @entity12 went for a haircut and came home the following day with 20 stitches wounds : @entity12 has a nasty gash on her belly and most of the skin on her front leg had to be removed , says @entity28 trainee : @entity28 says she would have thought twice about leaving her dog at @entity4 if she 'd known an inexperienced groomer would be handling her dog ' for her to be in such harm and be in so much pain from something like that , i think it 's just appalling , ' @entity28 told @entity40			1
