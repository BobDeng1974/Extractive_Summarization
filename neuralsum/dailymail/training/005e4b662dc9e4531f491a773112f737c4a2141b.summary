@entity0 held on to win the bragging rights in their local derby as @entity4 's 10th league goal of the season proved to be the difference at the @entity7			1
@entity8 was sent off for @entity9 in the first - half but @entity12 's side applied themselves during a fiercely competitive game			1
here , @entity15 's @entity14 gives his verdict on how the players performed at the @entity7 on sunday afternoon			2
@entity0 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) @entity18 - 7 fortunate to avoid reprimand when he touched heads with referee @entity21 in arguing an appeal			1
saved well with his foot from @entity24 and superbly from @entity25 to ensure win			0
@entity0 stopper @entity18 's clearance is blocked by @entity8 during the clash on sunday @entity29 - 6 should have been carded for lunge on @entity24 and blazed over chance in second half			1
did receive a yellow for diving in on @entity35 in the second period			0
@entity37 - 6.5 vocal as ever in organising the @entity0 defence and couple of tackles to catch the eye but lost @entity41 twice at set piece to allow the @entity44 headers in the closing stages			1
@entity46 - 7 excellent distribution , with one ball to @entity49 particularly good , and rarely appeared ruffled			2
the only exception being his mistimed slide on @entity25 to earn him a yellow			0
@entity54 - 6.5 in the main coped admirably against @entity25 and offered plenty going forwards , providing the killer cross for @entity4 ’s deciding goal			1
@entity59 - 7.5 an electric presence on the right wing for @entity0 and repeatedly troubled @entity62 with darts round the outside			1
hit the post with a good chance in the second half			0
midfielder @entity68 gestures to the officials during the @entity71 derby on sunday afternoon @entity68 - 7.5 delivered the pass that unlocked @entity9 ’s makeshift defence , slipping a ball of perfect weight and direction to @entity54			1
still not his barnstorming best but getting there			0
@entity79 - 6.5 brought in to add stability but also showed his class with a cross for @entity4 early on			1
but got a little swamped by @entity9 ’s resurgence in the second period and got a booking			2
@entity49 - 7.5 offered strong protection defensively down the left but also a creative spark			0
@entity90 foul from @entity8 that saw him sent off			2
@entity4 striker @entity4 fired in his 10th league goal of the season so far to put @entity0 ahead @entity4 - 8 a buzzing presence as usual from the first whistle and finished his goal superbly , gaining space with smart movement			1
not happy when hooked by @entity98 late on			0
@entity99 - 6.5 offered a good foil for his strike partner on his first start since august			0
tired towards the end and was replaced			0
@entity99 challenges @entity8 in the air during the first - half at the @entity7 on sunday @entity106 : @entity107 ( on for @entity108 ' ) - 5 added verve but little defensive assistance			1
@entity111 ( on for @entity112 ' ) - 5 should have done better with a chance			0
@entity114 ( on for @entity115 ' ) - 5 @entity9 keeper @entity116 made a number of key saves against their local rivals on sunday @entity9 ( 4 - 1 - 4 - 1 ) @entity116 - 7.5 once again @entity9 ’s best player			1
razor reflexes to keep out @entity59 ’s early shot that was heading high into the net and brave to leap at the feet of @entity4 as he bore down on goal			2
@entity127 - 4.5 performed like a right - winger operating at right - back			0
uncertain of his positioning so consistenly left holes for @entity0 to exploit			2
no surprise @entity0 ’s opener came from that flank			1
@entity8 - 2 dereliction of duty to get sent off in the manner he did in a game of this importance			1
his two yellow cards were dumb and dumber			0
@entity142 stupidity from the grammar school graduate			0
@entity9 right back @entity127 attempts to keep up with @entity0 striker @entity4 @entity8 looks devastated after being shown the red card after a rash challenge on @entity49 @entity147 - 4 extremely lucky to escape the red card that would have followed if referee @entity21 had spotted his foul as last man on @entity68			1
looked suspect until he did eventually depart early with a nasty shoulder injury			0
@entity62 - 6.5 @entity153 down the wing will get even the fittest player puffing his cheeks but coped well by and large			0
growing into the left - back @entity9 paid all that money for			1
@entity41 - 7 begun the match with a @entity161 turn , should have conceded a penalty with a clip on @entity4 , added grit to attacks , but missed a glorious chance for an equaliser with his header			1
@entity44 international @entity41 distributes the ball at the @entity7 , trying to start another @entity9 attack @entity172 - 5.5 guilty of giving away possession too often and lack of pace was exploited by @entity0 ’s speed on the break			1
booked for a foul on @entity68			0
@entity35 - 7.5 performance for the team , playing first in midfield then out wide and a constant source of motivation			0
set up @entity25 chance with superb run from deep			0
@entity9 captain @entity35 , tackling @entity99 , played in midfield at the @entity7 @entity188 - 6 sparkled on occasion in the early stages but failed to impose himself greatly and understandably the man sacrificed when @entity9 went down to 10 men			1
@entity194 - 7 @entity90 lunging fouls from @entity46 and @entity79 that earned both bookings and his energy was major factor in @entity9 ending the match in the ascendancy			2
record signing @entity194 leaps over a heavy challenge from @entity0 captain @entity37 @entity203 - 6 did excellently to craft his only chance by dribbling past @entity54 to shoot from a tight angle but does not possess enough mobility to function as focal point for counter-attacks			2
@entity106 : @entity210 ( on for @entity211 ’ ) - 6.5 coped well as emergency centre - back playing for the first time in six months			0
@entity214 ( on for @entity215 ' ) - 5 allowed @entity4 to escape for the winner			2
@entity217 ( on for @entity218 ' ) - 5			0

*incident* packed first - half ended 0 - 0 as @entity8 was sent off
@entity4 scored @entity0 's opener after *64* minutes
defeat leaves @entity9 *13* points off league *leaders* @entity228
