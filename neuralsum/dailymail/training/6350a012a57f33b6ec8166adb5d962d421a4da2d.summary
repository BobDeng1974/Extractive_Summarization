' ' and dude you sister is a lesbian ! ' @entity9 proclaimed , referring to the @entity42 's sister @entity47			1
' and if you can except ( accept ) that i 'm sure you can let gay and lesbians get married ! ' one of @entity9 's mums told @entity52 she was ' in shock ' when her son chose to pen the letter , but was proud of her son for standing up for what he believes in			2

it is so pathetic that you are n't letting the gay people of @entity32 and other countries get married here			2
' you were elected to represent our country , not yourself			0
just because you think it 's wrong , does not give you the right to make it illegal			0
does n't our opinions matter to you ? just because you 're the prime minister , which by the way does not give you all the power			2
' the @entity109 schoolboy also pointed out that mr @entity5 's own sister was in a same sex relationship and asked why he was stopping gay men and women from getting married in ' this beautiful country ' mr @entity5 responded to @entity122 's letter last friday but the 11 - year - old was less than impressed @entity122 's mum said she had nothing to do with the letter but she had encouraged him to be heard			1
