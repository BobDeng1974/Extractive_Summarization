@entity0 produced the equivalent of a sir @entity3 burn - up as he flew through the final two furlongs to imperiously land a tactical @entity4			1
the @entity6 track cycling icon is a retired spectator at the @entity8 but his name is still synonymous with high - speed two - wheel action			0
in what turned into a two - and - a - half - furlong sprint , @entity0 turned a one - and - a - half - length deficit into a length lead within 100 yards as he made 2013 winner @entity14 look pedestrian			1
on the march : @entity17 riding @entity0 ( right ) to win the @entity4 from @entity14 ( second left ) at @entity18 @entity17 , rider of the @entity20 - trained 2 - 5 favourite , reckoned he got a @entity3 - like feeling as @entity0 went sub- 11 seconds for the final two furlongs with a breakneck 10.22 secs for the penultimate one , @entity17 said : ‘ i ’ve never experienced going around a velodrome when they go real slow and then sprint for two laps but that will be as close as i will get			1
’ while @entity20 , who was winning the group one mile race for the first time , added : ‘ i used have an old @entity27 and i used to get into fifth gear and then flick a button			2
you can do that with him			0
he has a gear and then he has another			0
‘ i had him in the ( six - furlong ) @entity38 and he would have won it			2
i ran @entity39 , who was unlucky not to be a good second , and i would n’t have put them in the same work			0
’ in the pink : @entity17 and @entity0 romp home the queen elizabeth ii stakes at @entity46 in october is the one set target for the colt who has already won the @entity51 2,000 guineas and @entity52 with the @entity53 at @entity54 seemingly the only other race under consideration			2
it has been a memorable few days for @entity20 , who won saturday ’s @entity58 with @entity59			1
@entity0 ’s win stretched his lead over @entity62 to over £ 500,000 in the trainers ’ championship			1
for @entity62 this meeting with its huge expectations has so far been one of frustration			0
he has not yet had a winner @entity14 was one of five seconds he has saddled			1
but there was no argument about the @entity4 result			0
milking the applause : @entity0 looks to the crowd as @entity18 cheers a popular winner @entity77 , @entity14 ’s jockey , said : ‘ i hit the two furlong pole at full belt and i knew it would take a good one to get by me			1
i got first run on him off a slow pace and he has still beaten me			0
i ’ll have to bring a gun next time ! ’ a memorable day for @entity17 and @entity85 , owner of @entity0 , had started with sir @entity87 - trained @entity86 landing the @entity88			1
he goes for @entity90 ’s @entity89 and then probably the @entity91 for which @entity92 make him a 12 - 1 shot			0
@entity94 , @entity59 ’s jockey , is facing at least two weeks on the sidelines after x-rays showed he suffered a hairline fracture of his left arm in the fall of @entity100 on day one of the meeting			2
@entity104 will become a jumps only venue after owners @entity103 racecourses said it will cease to hold flat meetings from next year .			0

@entity0 turned a one - and - a - half - length deficit into a length lead within 100 yards
the @entity20 - trained *2.5* favourite made 2013 winner @entity14 look pedestrian
it has been a memorable few days for @entity20 , who won saturday ’s @entity58 with @entity59
