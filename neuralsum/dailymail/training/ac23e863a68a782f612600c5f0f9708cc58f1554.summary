by @entity0 published : 15:20 est , 4 september 2013 updated : 15:21 est , 4 september 2013 if you 're still reeling from the sight of @entity4 's ' cheek art ' , look away now			2
the star , who recently had both buttocks and her back tattooed with flowers , was nothing on these inked - up specimens , who have chosen to decorate their heads with an array of bizarre designs			1
from a topless angel emerging from between pigtails to a full @entity19 breakfast slathered all over one chap 's bald bonce , it seems nothing is too weird - or too painful - looking - for true body art aficionados			0
@entity23 : a chain - bearing child is painted exploding out of the flesh at the back of this person 's neck and while a study by the @entity32 reveals today that managers are less likely to employ someone if they have a tattoo , there are clearly some who want to have their tatts as in - your - face as possible			1
the @entity40 has recently banned its officers from getting visible tattoos , according to the @entity43 , with commissioner @entity44 saying they ' damage the professional image of the police '			0
even so , one in five people in @entity48 has a tattoo of some kind - although most of them are a little less noticeable than this hair - splitting selection			1
and among 19 - to 44 - year - olds , that figure rises to 29 per cent - for both men and women			0
thick skull : you 've heard the expression ' built like a brick wall ' ... exposed : a scantily - clad angel figure emerges from behind this woman 's pigtails skull swirls : this tattooed individual appears very happy with the design on their head metal heads : these two men have gone for a machine theme in their tattoos - with extras , as far as the gentleman on the right is concerned the number of celebrities sporting tattoos is said to have boosted the trend in body art , with @entity4 's derriere design being just one of many from stars who choose to decorate themselves			1
a few days ago , @entity84 stripped down to his swimming shorts on the beach - flashing a brand new design on the right side of his chest that brought his tattoo collection up to a whopping total of 33			2
tv presenter @entity92 recently said she regretted ' one or two ' of her tattoos - then made a quick u-turn in an interview today with @entity96 , saying she has stopped caring what other people think about her and her tattoos			1
' i do n't give a c * * * what people think anymore			2
i do n't care if people say they do n't like my tattoos , ' she said			2
' they are all a part of who i am			0
' feeling hungry ? this man 's full @entity19 breakfast has clearly gone to his head shark , back and sides : a ravening sea beast curls around this man 's ear ninja nut : this man 's hair has been scraped back to reveal the tiny kung - fu artist beneath even in these trying economic times , the tattoo industry is booming , with the number of tattoo parlours in the @entity48 rising from around 300 in the early 2000s to more than 1,500 today			1
and the trend is n't entirely new either - @entity127 's mother @entity126 had a small snake on her wrist , while @entity130 , before he was crowned , had a dragon inked on his arm during a visit to @entity134 in 1882			0
the instrument used to create the designs today - the twin - coil electromagnetic tattoo needle - was patented in 1891			1
and tattoos go back to ancient times , with @entity140 - a prehistoric man discovered in @entity141 who lived 5,300 years ago - having marks of 57 tattoos on his body			0
but none of @entity140 's tatts - mostly dots and lines - quite match up to these skull sketches			0
@entity150 : a @entity152 fan may have got carried away with his love for the spy ... and here 's @entity4 's offering : @entity4 revealed that she had had her backside and back tattooed in august			0

tattoo designs *include* pictures of machinery , people and torn flesh
