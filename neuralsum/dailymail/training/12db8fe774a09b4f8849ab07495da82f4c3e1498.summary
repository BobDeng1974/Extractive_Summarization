by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 's @entity2 fired his second hole - in - one in the space of two months on his way to a course - record 63 that vaulted him into contention for the @entity9 on saturday			1
@entity2 's previous ace earnt him a @entity11 from the tournament sponsors in the final round of the @entity14 at the end of april			1
and although the 26 - year - old did not win anything for his ' slam dunk ' effort on the seventh hole at @entity21 - a £ 65,000 @entity22 was on offer on the 13th - it sparked a brilliant round and helped set the clubhouse target of 11 under par. good form : @entity3 's @entity2 has put himself in contention for the @entity9 title ' we had a perfect number , 168 yards with an eight iron but you never expect it to slam dunk , ' @entity2 said			1
' that was a bit of a bonus			0
' fresh from finishing 45th on his @entity41 debut at @entity42 last week , @entity2 had already birdied the fourth and added another at the eighth to reach the turn in 32			2
the former @entity47 champion 's challenge was slowed by a run of four straight pars on the back nine , but he then birdied four of the last five holes to beat the previous course record of 64 set by @entity53 on thursday			2
' we 've been playing great for a long time but could not seem to get anything going on the greens , ' added @entity2 , whose sole @entity58 title to date came in the @entity59 in 2012			2
' but holing a wedge yesterday ( for an eagle on the second ) and an eight iron today certainly helps			0
' coming from the @entity41 last week it was a slightly different mentality , it was quite tricky to stop playing 20 feet away from the flags and on the first day we were too cautious			0
' there 's a score out there and it just depends if anyone takes it , but a good round today has put us in a good position			0
' in the lead : @entity75 's @entity53 is ahead in @entity76 @entity53 had led ever since his opening 64 and remained top of the leaderboard midway through his round , birdies on the second and third taking the @entity81 to 12 under par. playing partner @entity83 was a shot behind @entity2 on 10 under after three birdies and one bogey on the front nine , with @entity3 's @entity87 and @entity89 's @entity88 safely in the clubhouse on nine under following rounds of 66 and 65 respectively			1
former @entity41 champion @entity92 was a shot behind on eight under after a birdie on the 11th repaired some of the damage caused by bogeys on the eighth and ninth .			0

@entity75 's @entity53 leads the pack but @entity2 plays ace to *shuffle* the pack
26 - year - old scored brilliant hole - in - one on the seventh hole
£ *65k* sports *car* on offer for the first hole - in - one on the 13th
