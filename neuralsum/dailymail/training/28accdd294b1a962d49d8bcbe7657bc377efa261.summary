a mysterious new disease has left scores of people in @entity3 and some in the @entity4 with @entity6 - like symptoms even though they are not infected with @entity7			1
the patients ' immune systems become damaged , leaving them unable to fend off germs as healthy people do			1
what triggers this is unknown but the disease does not seem to be contagious			1
it appears to be another kind of acquired immune deficiency that is not inherited and occurs in adults			2
however it does n't spread the way @entity6 does through a virus , said dr @entity22 , a scientist at the @entity23 ( @entity23 ) , which is part of the @entity25			2
dr @entity26 , right , talks with patient @entity27 at the @entity25			0
researchers have identified a mysterious new disease with @entity6 - like symptoms even though they are not infected with @entity7 she helped lead the study with researchers in @entity34 and @entity35 where most of the cases have been found since 2004			1
their report is in thursday 's @entity39			0
' this is absolutely fascinating			0
i 've seen probably at least three patients in the last 10 years or so ' who might have had this , said dr. @entity44 , an infectious disease specialist at the @entity46 in @entity47			1
it 's still possible that an infection of some sort could trigger the disease , even though the disease itself does n't seem to spread person - to - person , he said			1
the disease develops around age 50 on average but does not run in families , which makes it unlikely that a single gene is responsible , @entity22 said			1
some patients have died of overwhelming infections , including some @entity3 now living in the @entity4 , although @entity22 could not estimate how many			1
@entity27 , 62 , a seamstress from @entity63 who has lived in @entity64 since 1975 , was gravely ill when she sought help for a persistent fever , infections throughout her bones and other bizarre symptoms in 2009			2
she had been sick off and on for several years and had visited @entity63 in 1995 and again in early 2009			0
research from the @entity23 , part of the @entity25 ( pictured ) , reveals the disease causes patients ' immune systems to become damaged , leaving them unable to fend off germs			1
what triggers this is n't known ' she was wasting away from this systemic infection ' that at first seemed like tuberculosis but was n't , said dr @entity81 , a family physician at the @entity82 in @entity83 , @entity64			0
' she 's a small woman to begin with , but when i first saw her , her weight was 91 pounds , and she lost down to 69 pounds			0
' @entity87 ( pronounced ' when ' ) was referred to specialists at the @entity25 who had been tracking similar cases			0
she spent nearly a year at an @entity25 hospital in @entity93 , @entity94 , and is there now for monitoring and further treatment			0
' i feel great now , ' she said on wednesday			0
but when she was sick , ' i felt dizzy , headaches , almost fell down , ' she said			0
' i could not eat anything			0
' @entity6 is a specific disease , and it stands for acquired immune deficiency syndrome			2
that means the immune system becomes impaired during someone 's lifetime , rather than from inherited gene defects like the ' bubble babies ' who are born unable to fight off germs			2
the virus that causes @entity7 - destroys t - cells , key soldiers of the immune system that fight germs			2
the new disease does n't affect those cells , but causes a different kind of damage			2
@entity22 's study of more than 200 people in @entity35 and @entity34 found that most of those with the disease make substances called auto - antibodies that block interferon - gamma , a chemical signal that helps the body clear infections			1
blocking that signal leaves people like those with @entity6 - vulnerable to viruses , fungal infections and parasites , but especially micobacteria , a group of germs similar to tuberculosis that can cause severe lung damage			1
researchers are calling this new disease an ' adult - onset ' immunodeficiency syndrome because it develops later in life and they do n't know why or how			1
' fundamentally , we do not know what 's causing them to make these antibodies , ' @entity22 said			0
antibiotics are n't always effective , so doctors have tried a variety of other approaches , including a cancer drug that helps suppress production of antibodies			0
the disease quiets in some patients once the infections are tamed , but the faulty immune system is likely a chronic condition , researchers believe			1
the fact that nearly all the patients so far have been @entity3 or @entity3 - born people living elsewhere suggests that genetic factors and something in the environment such as an infection may trigger the disease , researchers conclude			1
the first cases turned up in 2004 and @entity22 's study enrolled about 100 people in six months			0
' we know there are many others out there , ' including many cases mistaken as tuberculosis in some countries , she said .			0

@entity175 has affected mostly @entity3 - born patients and some in @entity4
genetic and environmental factors may trigger the disease
disease does not run in families or spread person - to - person
some patients have died of overwhelming infections
