by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 29 may 2013 updated : 07:35 est , 29 may 2013 a giant fluorescent pink slug and a cannibal snail have been discovered in a remote part of @entity5			1
the pink slug grows up to 20 centimetres long , while the carnivore snail preys on its vegetarian relatives			1
both bizarre creatures live around @entity10 near @entity11 in @entity12 - around 323 miles northwest of @entity13			1
the unique giant fluorescent pink slug @entity14 found only in the misty @entity10 area of @entity12 , @entity5			1
it grows around 20 centrimetres long and feeds on moss			2
it is a relative of the @entity20 slug found in other areas of @entity12 and @entity22 @entity10 is a mountain near @entity11 in northern @entity12			1
it is situated around 323 miles northwest of @entity13			0
it stands at 1,508 metres , is part of the @entity27 and has been preserved within the @entity28			0
it is the remnants of an extinct volcano that was active about 18 million years ago			0
most of the vegetation on the mountain is dry forest yet there are small pockets of damp rainforest - style environments where unique creatures such as the pink slug and cannibal snail live			1
during winter months the region can get long periods of heavy rainfall as well as dusting of snow near the mountain 's summit			1
locals have long reported sightings of the bizarre pink slug , especially after heavy rainfall , yet taxonomists have only recently confirmed it is the same species as the red triangle slug , officially known as @entity57			1
these pinks slugs are thought to date back to @entity59 , the name given to two continents that formed part of the @entity64 supercontinent which existed between 180 million years ago			2
these two landmasses formed to create what is now known as @entity5			0
the giant @entity68 graeffi slug ( left ) , and the cannibal snail ( right ) are both thought to be unique to the @entity10 region of @entity12			1
the slugs feed on moss and are usually spotted after periods of heavy rainfall , whereas the snails eat other vegetarian land snails that live in the remote region the slug lives in an area about six miles long by six miles wide and is unique to the mountaintop region , although relatives can be found in @entity82 and @entity83			1
the cannibal snail is also thought to be unique to the @entity10 region and only eats other vegetable land snails that also live in the area			1
both are thought to have originated in eastern @entity5 when it was made up of damp rainforests			0
following a volcano eruption around 17 million years ago the area began to dry out and only small pockets of rainforest - style environments remained			2
this restricted the areas where these invertebrates could live			0
@entity96 , who has been a national parks ranger in the region for 20 years , told the @entity99 : ' it 's a tiny island of alpine forest , hundreds of kilometres away from anything else like it			0
forests on the northwest slopes of @entity10 near @entity11 in @entity12			2
its vegetation is mainly dry , although areas of rainforest remain and heavy rainfall makes it the ideal location for the pink slug and cannibal snail to live the slugs , for example , are buried in the leaf mould during the day , but sometimes at night they come out in their hundreds and feed off the mould and moss on the trees			1
they are amazing , unreal - looking creatures			0
' the slug is just one of the rare inhabitants of the misty region of @entity10 that is also synonymous with flowering snow gum plants and native vines			2
because of these rare and unique creatures , the @entity12 scientific committee has recently made a preliminary decision to list the site as an ' endangered ecological community '			2
this means it has the highest level of protection from intrusion and development			0
the committee 's report said : ' these species have evolved from lowland ancestors and have been isolated in an otherwise snail - hostile environment as conditions began to dry			0
' as a result , they are '' acutely susceptible '' to human - induced climate change			0
temperatures a degree or two higher would dry out their mountaintop			0

giant fluorescent pink slugs can grow up to 20cm long and are usually spotted after heavy rainfall around @entity10 in @entity12
the cannibal snails feed on other vegetarian land snails found in the region
the slug lives in an area about six meters *squared* and is unique to the mountaintop region
