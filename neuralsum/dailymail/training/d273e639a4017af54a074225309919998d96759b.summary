@entity6 , 52 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , drove for 12 hours a day and said the most exercise he got was popping into the local pub. on the road he would tuck into a fry - up so large that it covered two dinner plates and snacked on crisps and chocolate in his cab			1
in the evening , he tucked into takeaways and admits he could easily finish a case of lager			2
mr @entity6 weighed 18.5st before the threat of losing his @entity24 licence motivated him to get fit the father - of - two used to eat huge fry - ups for breakfast and snack on crisps and chocolate ' i used to drive in @entity32 and would bring lack lots of cheap alcohol back home , ' he told @entity36			1

' the doctor told me i needed to bring my blood pressure down by september or i would lose my licence , but i did n't just want to pop pills , ' he said			1
' as soon as i was faced with not being able to pay the mortgage , everything changed for me			2
' the determined trucker , who had just started a new job as a driver for @entity56 , started cycling to and from the depot every day - a round trip of 18 miles			1
he had to borrow his then 20 - year - old son 's bike as he did n't have one of his own			2
' it was a simple decision , though it felt like it nearly killed me , ' he said			2
' the first day i cycled i had to get up at 3.30am to get in for a 5.30am shift as it took me an hour to cycle nine miles			1
' then i did a 12 and a half hour shift and cycling back it poured with rain			2
' i remember lying in bed aching from my eyebrows to my ankles			2
but i would n't be beaten			0
' before and after : the lorry driver lost five stone in just nine months and shrunk his waistline by 10inches the father - of - two also overhauled his diet			2

' ' i looked and felt like a different person even some of my relatives did not recognise me			0
i felt great and looked thin			0
' i then gave my self a challenge and took a biking holiday in @entity111 alps			0
the views were breathtaking but the hills were big and challenging			0
one took me 50 minutes to get up			0
' what a difference : mr @entity6 before he tackled his paunch ( l ) in 2006 and competing in a triathlon in 2011 ( r ) new challenge : @entity6 lost 9lbs on a nine - day training trip for the @entity119 then in 2010 , mr @entity6 got a personal trainer to help tone up his muscles			1

' i 've taken part in two training sessions and during my last nine - day trip i dropped nine pounds , ' he said			1
' you have to eat lots of carbs because you burn 6,000 calories a day working on the yacht			1
' it 's different as you are working in a team and i 'm used to being on my own			0
they are mostly consultants , professors and engineers but we do get on			0
i like baking and bring along my home - made cakes , which boosts morale ! ' mr @entity6 is fitter now ( right ) then he was 20 years ago ( left )			1
he still drives lorries but exercises every day today mr @entity6 , who now works night shifts , is fighting fit			1
each day he takes his two dogs for an hour and a half each day before heading to the gym or getting his wife to drop him 10km from home on her way to work			2
and his adventuring wo n't stop after he 's sailed the high seas			0
