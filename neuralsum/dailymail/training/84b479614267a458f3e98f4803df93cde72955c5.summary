by @entity0 published : 08:40 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 09:49 est , 21 may 2012 @entity1 was heckled by protesters who branded him a ' war criminal ' as he gave a graduation speech at an @entity6 college			1
the former @entity8 prime minister , 59 , had to break off his his address as he spoke to 400 graduates and their guests at @entity12 , in @entity13			1
protesters shouted phrases such as ' warmonger ' and ' you 're a war criminal ' during his speech			1
guest of honour : former @entity8 prime minister @entity1 shakes hands with a @entity12 graduate after giving the commencement address audience : the ceremony was attended by 400 students as well as their friends and family in his address , @entity1 appealed for international cooperation and for people to try to understand other cultures			1
the former premier , who served from 1997 to 2007 , backed the @entity6 in it so - called war on terror and took @entity8 to war in @entity40 and @entity41			1
his decision to send troops to topple @entity44 prompted widespread criticism , including a massive anti-war march in @entity47 which attracted more than one million demonstrators			0
but , while he has long been dogged by demonstrations in @entity8 carrying out stunts like trying to arrest him , it is the first time his appearances in the @entity6 have been hijacked by protesters			1
in the @entity55 , where initial opposition to the @entity41 war was much smaller , @entity1 had long garnered widespread respect as a dynamic leader who stood by @entity6			2
furthermore , @entity6 usually focus their ire on @entity61 and prefer to see @entity1 as a man misled by the former president than someone who may have sought to deceive others			2
flashpoint : protesters outside the @entity68 into the @entity41 war where @entity1 gave evidence in 2010 anger : protesters clash with police as @entity1 attends his book signing at a bookstore in @entity75 in september 2010 anger at @entity1 stems from the fact his @entity79 government sold the case for war on a so - called ' dodgy ' dossier based on false information claiming @entity44 had weapons of mass destruction			2
much of it was found to be plagarised from a phd thesis and many protesters claim @entity1 knew its contentions - such as that @entity41 could deploy chemical warheads within 45 minutes - were lies			0
he and his wife , @entity93 , had three children when he entered office			0
she gave birth to another son , @entity97 , in 2000 - the first baby born to a serving pm in more than 150 years			0
since leaving office he has made a multimillion pound fortune out of corporate consultancy and on the international speaking circuit			0
he has also taken up a role as official @entity106 envoy of the quartet and , in 2008 , launched his @entity108 .			0

@entity1 branded ' warmonger ' during speech at @entity12 , @entity13
such protests are *unusual* in the states despite his *vilification* in @entity8
