white fat cells are responsible for flab , but brown fat converts energy into heat			1
to make white cells behave like brown ones , researchers found a new signalling pathway called adenosine sit ups help tone your stomach , while squats strengthen your legs and bottom - but love handles are particularly difficult to shift			2
now scientists believe they have discovered a way to ‘ melt ’ the excess white fat in muffin tops by turning it ‘ brown ’			1
while white cells are responsible for muffin tops and flab in general , brown fat cells convert excess energy in food into heat			1
to make white cells behave like brown ones , researchers at the @entity30 discovered a new signalling pathway			2
‘ not all fat is equal , ’ said professor @entity34 from the @entity35 of the @entity36			0
‘ if we are able to activate brown fat cells or to convert white fat cells into brown ones , it might be possible to simply melt excess fat away			1
’ by experimenting on mice , professor @entity34 discovered a new signalling pathway for a molecule called adenosine			0
@entity49 is known to activate brown fat cells , and is typically released during stress			0
the adenosine signal is transmitted adenosine receptor @entity53			2
‘ if adenosine binds to this receptor in brown fat cells , fat burning is significantly stimulated , ’ claimed dr. @entity55 from professor @entity34 's team			1
‘ the brown fat in mice behaves just as in humans , ’ added professor @entity34			0
in addition , the research team investigated the possibility that adenosine transforms white fat cells into brown fat cells - a process termed ‘ browning ’			1
white fat cells normally can not be induced to burn excess fat by adenosine , because they lack the @entity53 receptor			1
@entity49 ( molecule illustrated ) is capable of activating brown fat cells and is typically released during stress			2
the adenosine signal is transmitted by the adenosine receptor @entity53			0
by transferring the @entity53 receptor gene in white fat cells in mice , they began ' browning ' and burning energy for this reason , the team of scientists transferred the @entity53 receptor gene from brown fat cells to white fat cells in mice			1
consequently , the white fat cells with @entity53 receptors started ' browning ' and burning energy			1
‘ through the administration of adenosine - like substances , the mice actually lost weight , ’ continued professor @entity34			0
' our results demonstrate that adenosine - @entity53 signalling plays an unexpected physiological role in [ brown fat ] activation and protects mice from diet - induced obesity			0
those findings reveal new possibilities for developing novel obesity therapies			0
' however , many questions still need to be investigated , continued the researchers , and clinical application is ' still far off '			0
the results are published in the journal @entity114 .			0

scientists discovered a way to ‘ melt ’ excess white fat by turning it ‘ brown ’
white cells are responsible for muffin tops and flab , for example
while brown fat cells convert excess energy in food into heat
these brown cells behave in this way because of adenosine receptor @entity53
this receptor sends the adenosine molecule to break down the cells
by transferring the receptor into white cells , they behaved like brown ones
