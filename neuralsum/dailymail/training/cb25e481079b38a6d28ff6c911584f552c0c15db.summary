by @entity0 disgraced : @entity1 , with this trademark spectacles removed for this police - issue photo he was one of our best - loved entertainers , charming the nation ’s families and the @entity8 alike over five decades			1
yet all the while @entity1 was hiding behind his wholesome image as children ’s tv presenter , musician and artist to sexually prey on dozens of women and girls as young as seven			1

’ another victim , @entity80 reporter @entity79 , said : ‘ i ’m so relieved for all the women who came forward and all of those who have n’t , to see him being exposed for what he is – a predatory paedophile , an opportunistic sexual predator			2
’ @entity1 could face years behind bars as three of the 12 counts carry a possible ten - year sentence			1
releasing him on unconditional bail , mr @entity89 warned him : ‘ given the conviction on all 12 counts it is inevitable that the type of sentence that is upmost in the court ’s mind is a custodial sentence , and he must understand that			1
’ during his trial , the court heard that @entity1 had hidden the dark side of his ‘ @entity105 ’ personality			2
carefully concealing the ‘ demon lurking beneath his charming exterior ’ he used his fame to beguile innocent and impressionable young fans mesmerised by his talent			0
he groomed his daughter ’s best friend for 16 years , assaulting her while @entity52 , then 16 , slept just yards away			1

’ @entity1 was bailed until friday when he will be sentenced			2
his only child hoped to inherit £ 11million			0
but with the prospect of lengthy and expensive legal battles ahead as victims file damages claims , and his paintings plummeting in value , much of @entity1 ’s fortune could be wiped out			1

she wrote an email to her parents on july 25 , 2012 – before his arrest – referring to an inheritance of ‘ around £ 11million ’			0
she said : ‘ i understand that i am sole inheritor of your estate – is this true ? if i am , then i feel you both have to sit down and discuss your feelings or beliefs about this inheritance			0
‘ if i am going to inherit this money , i need to be part of the running of the company as it will be my responsibility in the future ? it ’s a massive responsibility that i need to understand and feel empowered by and part of ... ‘ please imagine how it is for me ... figures in millions are being talked about willy - nilly			0
