after experiencing major devastation and loss of life in the april 25 earthquake , @entity0 was left with an unsavoury taste in its mouth after receiving packets of ‘ beef masala ’ as part of the relief package from @entity11			1
since the majority - @entity14 country treats cows as sacred and there is a blanket ban on slaughtering the animal , the development has the potential to trigger diplomatic acrimony between the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) member countries			1
@entity24 doctors at @entity26 ’s @entity25 told @entity27 that packets of ‘ beef masala ’ were sent by @entity11 on tuesday as part of relief aid to the temblor survivors			1
these doctors – drawn from @entity33 ( @entity34 ) @entity25 , @entity35 and @entity36 ( @entity37 ) — are members of a 34 - member medical team sent to @entity0 for treating the survivors			1
“ when we reached the airport to collect the food items from @entity11 , we found packets of ready - to - eat meals , including packets of ‘ beef masala ’			1
there were other food items too , ” dr @entity40 told @entity27			2
perplexed , the doctors chose to have food from a hotel instead			2
“ we did not touch the @entity11 aid , ” dr @entity40 said			1
“ most of the local people are not aware of the contents			2
when they understand , they avoid it , ” said another doctor on the condition of anonymity			2
he added : “ @entity11 has hurt @entity0 ’s religious sentiments by supplying the masala			1
shockingly , it did not care about the sensitivity of the matter			1
” @entity11 soldiers load relief supplies for @entity0 exclusive photographs of the ‘ beef masala ’ packets supplied to @entity0 are with @entity27			1
these pictures clearly show that the place of origin of these packets was @entity74 in @entity11			1
these packets also prominently mention that these are not for sale and the contents include ‘ potato bhujia ’ and ‘ beef masala ’			2
a top @entity0 government official said : “ the matter has been conveyed to prime minister @entity82 and the intelligence chief			1
we are also starting an internal inquiry to verify the facts			1
if the report is correct , we will raise the matter at the diplomatic level with @entity11			1
@entity24 , being our key partner , will also be informed of the developments			1
” @entity92 , spokesperson for @entity11 ’s ministry of foreign affairs , told @entity27 : “ i am not aware of the issue … i am not responsible for the dispatch			1
the relief aid is sent by the @entity97			2

the website also states that the processing centre provides food to civil population during natural calamities , like earthquakes and floods			0
according to @entity14 belief , eating beef is a religious offence since the cow is a sacred animal and treated on a par with one ’s mother			1
in @entity0 — for long the world ’s only @entity14 state — the first royal order officially prohibiting cow slaughter stated that the punishments for the crime were death and confiscation of all property of the offender			1
the first @entity167 of @entity0 , the @entity168 of 1854 , stated : “ this kingdom is the only kingdom in the world where cows , women , and @entity173 may not be killed			1
” it trumpeted @entity0 as the ‘ purest @entity14 kingdom ’ and simultaneously signaled to @entity0 citizens that @entity14 religious creeds would be the law of the land			1
but an amendment in 1990 to the @entity167 made cow slaughter punishable by 12 years in prison			1
