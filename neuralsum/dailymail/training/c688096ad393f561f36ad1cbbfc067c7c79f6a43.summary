another winter storm is set to strike the @entity1 , pummeling the already - frozen landscape with as much as ten inches of snow in a four - day onslaught			1
less than a week after parts of the region received unprecedented levels of snowfall , a new system is set to roll down across the @entity10 from the @entity12 border			1
the storm , dubbed @entity14 , is due to start with light snow saturday , but will intensify and continue through to tuesday			0
deeper blue means a higher chance of a large difference			0
the @entity34 will be warmer than usual in the same period winter weather will carve a path stretching from @entity37 in the south into the upper reaches of @entity40 and @entity41 to the north , according to forecasts by @entity44			0
@entity45 , and @entity46 in particular , will be at the epicenter of the snowstorm , and could be due another 11 inches of snow			2
the region is still digging its way out from under a 40 - inch dump that has come in the past two weeks , setting new snowfall records in the state 's capital			1
most of @entity45 was already on a winter storm alert friday night			0
the snowfall is set to be accompanied by bitter cold , with the @entity27 predicting temperatures far below average for stretching from @entity62 to southern @entity63			0
stacking up : the above chart shows how intensely major parts of @entity66 and the @entity1 are set to be struck , with already - snowy @entity46 due the most lingering : @entity67 is still causing problems in the area set to be struck again			1
@entity70 , cars and a trailer pile up on a road in @entity74 , upstate @entity37 just chilling : meanwhile in @entity76 , which is further west than the storm , ice carvers set to work in one of the city 's parks the initial storm , which is due to drop several inches of snow over the weekend , will be followed immediately by a new cold weather system which will bring yet more snow			2
however , the outer reaches of the ' snow corridor ' straddling @entity66 will be less badly affected , with as little as three inches of snow forecast over @entity37			0
according to @entity91 , the dip in temperatures will be due to disturbances in the jet stream pushing the boundaries of cold and warm air past the @entity12 border into the @entity97 the outlet also said that , while there could be significant snowfall across the four days , the disruption will be less than in a short , intense storm because snow plows will have more time to clear it up .			1
