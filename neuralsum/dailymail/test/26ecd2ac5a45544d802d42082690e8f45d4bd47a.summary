model and actress @entity1 is not a daredevil stunt driver who raced in @entity4 7 - she just plays one on tv			1
in the run - up to the premiere of the latest installment in the @entity12 franchise , the athletic , petite brunette gained notice with her claims she was the sole female stunt driver in the action flick starring @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
but as the car blog @entity20 reported thursday , @entity1 has been brazenly misrepresenting herself as a member of the film 's crew			2
in the interview , which has since been taken down , the 5 - foot - 5 , 95 - pound actress gushed about how thrilling it was for her to join a major franchise like @entity12			0
' being both an actress and stunt driver , there is no better film to be involved in , ' she told her interviewer			1
when asked what it was like being the only female stunt car driver , @entity1 addressed some of the challenges of working in a male dominated - industry			1
' female stunt drivers are far and few in between , ' she lamented , without missing a beat			1
' it ’s hard to break into the stunt industry , even harder if you are a female			2
' but to be the only female stunt driver on a set of this magnitude was absolutely mind blowing ! i feel very honored			1
' ms @entity1 then talked about the filming process , saying she did most of her driving in the desert and that her record speed on the shoot was 140mph			2
@entity73 , the supervising stuntman for @entity4 , told @entity20 that his drivers usually do n't go above 50mph for safety reasons			2
nice try : @entity1 even photoshopped herself into a poster of the film , wedging her picture between @entity17 and the late @entity80 cog in a machine : a stunt supervisor on @entity4 said @entity1 worked as an extra on the set ( pictured ) - one among some 1,500 people more lies : during an interview with @entity87 , @entity1 said she became licensed with the @entity88 in @entity89 and later got certified as a stunt driver in @entity91 when asked about the passing of @entity12 franchise stalwart @entity80 , who was killed in a car crash last year , @entity1 said that he was sorely missed on the set , where she described the mood as very somber			1
' but the job had to be done			0
the film had to be complete			0
it definitely ​ was not an easy task , ' she noted			0
@entity1 then launched into a monologue about how proud she was to be part of the @entity4 stunt family , how she has never sought public recognition for her ' craft , ' and how driving was in her blood			1
' it ’s a lifelong passion , and i am just simply grateful i am able to live my passion , ' she concluded			0
during that interview , ms @entity1 causally mentioned that she has been in the stunt industry ' for a while ' - a statement that would come back to haunt her later on			1
the @entity41 from the @entity114 premiere last friday raised some eyebrows among stunt drivers , who wasted no time calling @entity117 out as a con artist			1
backlash : members of the stunt community quickly called out @entity1 for her fibs on @entity123 and @entity124 , insisting that she was a fraud and a liar brazen : @entity1 , pictured right with director @entity128 , talked about the somber mood on the set after @entity80 's passing last year @entity132 , a director and stunt coordinator , tweeted in response to @entity117 ’s bold claims : ' social media and self promotion can be deceiving but you will get caught			1
' @entity139 also did not mince words , calling the wannabe racer a ' liar ' and a ' fraud			0
' @entity143 , another member of the stunt community , was equally harsh in her appraisal of @entity117			0
all smiles : @entity1 proudly posed with action star @entity148 , who starred in @entity4 ' what a pathetic excuse for a person , you should be banned from the entertainment industry , ' she tweeted in reaction to the eviscerating @entity20 takedown of the bogus furious 7 crew member			2
as the automotive blog reported , @entity1 ’s lie - riddled interview on @entity41 was not a matter of an ambitious performer getting carried away or fudging a few minor details , given that she has made similar claims on other occasions			1
during an interview with @entity87 , @entity1 asserted that after being asked to perform car stunts in a movie she was in , she became licensed with the @entity88 in @entity89 and later got certified as a stunt driver in @entity91			1
after offering a jumbled response to a question about car brakes - @entity117 claimed stunt drivers do n't use brakes but instead ' rig ' emergency breaks - she mentioned that the latest film she worked on was furious 7			2
@entity73 , the stun supervisor on the film , stated that @entity1 was not employed as a driver			2
her connection to the project did not go beyond her role as an extra in a crowd of 1,500			2
he also refuted @entity117 ’s assertion that she was the only female driver on set , saying that the production involved at least seven or eight female stunt doubles , including the veteran racer @entity186			1
but @entity117 ’s @entity188 account and imdb page painted a very different picture			0
on her photo - sharing page , the fashion designer and actress uploaded a black - and - white furious 7 poster , with her face crudely photoshopped between @entity17 and the late @entity80			0
the post was accompanied by the hashtags # stuntdriver # workingactress # workinggirl on her @entity199 page , @entity117 , who has about a dozen and half minor movie credits – including a manicurist in what just happened and a hotel guest in @entity207 ’s @entity206 - is listed as an unaccredited ' race car driver ' in @entity4			2
about - face : in response to the growing outrage sparked by her claims , @entity1 issued a statement on her @entity124 monday apologizing for a ' misunderstanding ' small - time thespian : @entity117 has about a dozen and half minor movie credits – including a manicurist in what just happened and a hotel guest in @entity207 ’s hitch she listed @entity4 7 as her most recent project on @entity199 , describing herself as an unaccredited ' race car driver ' in the film in response to the growing backlash sparked by her furious 7 premiere interview , @entity1 issued a muddled statement on her @entity124 monday apologizing for a ' misunderstanding			1
' ‘ dear friends and co-workers , please accept my humblest apologies for any confusion and / or misunderstandings with regards to the @entity41 article “ @entity236 with female stunt car driver @entity1 , ’ she wrote			1
‘ as you are all aware i am new to this industry and i am learning as i go along			0
i had no idea that an inconsequential interview of a few questions about my experience working with all of you , would create such a rift between us			0
‘ i assure you , i meant no harm and i hope you will accept my apologies for any inconvenience it may have caused			0

@entity1 presented herself as a daredevil stunt driver who **appeared** in newly released *blockbuster*
said in interview on @entity41 at @entity4 premiere in @entity114 that she was the only female *stuntwoman* driving cars
the production , in fact , employed seven or eight female stunt drivers , but @entity1 was not one of them
she only **appeared** as extra on the set in a crowd of 1,500
