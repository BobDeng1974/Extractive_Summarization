all eyes will be on @entity1 when @entity2 take on his former club @entity3 this weekend - not that successor @entity4 is paying much attention to that reunion at @entity7			1
having controversially replaced popular manager @entity10 in january 2013 , the former @entity8 international was quick to win around not only the fans but admirers from afar			2
@entity15 ' swashbuckling , high - pressing style earned plenty of plaudits and last season saw them enjoy their best - ever @entity21 campaign			1
@entity3 boss @entity4 is not too concerned about @entity1 facing his former team @entity3 are hoping to make it seven successive wins with victory against @entity2 at @entity7 @entity1 gestures to bring on @entity26 at his new club @entity2 that success came at a cost , though , as a host of key players were poached in the wake of @entity1 and his staff moving to @entity2 in the summer			1
odds on relegation were dramatically cut but @entity4 's men have so far confounded the nay - sayers , as they start the weekend second in the standings on a run of six successive wins in all competitions			1
a seventh at the expense of @entity1 's side would be extra special for many connected with the club , although @entity4 is not concerning himself with the background noise			1
' for me [ it does ] not [ give this game extra spice ] because i was n't here last season , but i understand for @entity1 maybe it 's special , ' the @entity48 said			2
' i think it 's special for him and maybe for some players			0
' we changed a lot this season our squad but it 's always special for some players who worked with @entity1 last season			2
' but there is no influence in the final result because the most important thing is to win the game or lose the game			0
' new signing @entity69 ( c ) celebrates after scoring a contender for goal of the season against @entity74 @entity75 @entity1 won many admirers for his high pressing game during his spell on the south coast while there have been numerous changes at @entity82 's , @entity1 will be coming up against several familiar faces			2
that core of players has helped @entity3 's plethora of new arrivals adapt , providing @entity4 with a good foundation from which to build			1
' every manager has his own way of working but from the first day of this season what i saw was a great spirit in the team , and i heard that was one of the qualities of last season , ' the @entity48 said			0
' the team and the players are continuing with that			0
' okay , it was difficult because we had a lot of changes but we had good scouting in the club and we bought good players in and maybe the challenge now is higher than the last season			0
' everybody was surprised with the eighth position last season , but people love how the team is doing and we will do everything to keep that			0
last season is the past and we have to look forward			0
' the determination to keep improving has not only impressed @entity4 but a number of international managers , too			2
@entity15 captain @entity120 was called up by @entity121 for the first time on friday , following on from @entity124 's selection by @entity125 the previous day			1
the right - back has played a key role in @entity3 's fine start to the campaign and @entity4 rates as one of the best he has coached in the position			1
saints skipper @entity120 has received a first call up from @entity121 for the upcoming @entity136 qualifiers @entity4 has nothing but praise for defender @entity139 ( @entity140 ) who has received a first @entity125 call up ' i think everybody is agreed with that call because he 's doing a fantastic job and he 's still 23 years old and still a young player , ' @entity4 said			1
' he has had a great progression this season and is playing very good for the team			0
' he 's one of the best in his position because he 's defending good and he 's fast and he shows his physical side			0
' in the last minute against @entity74 , he made a run about 60 or 70 metres and that showed his spirit for the team and he 's a very good player			0
