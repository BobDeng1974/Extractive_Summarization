these were on top of basketball ’s entire elite monies being withdrawn by @entity70 , who on appeal gave the sport a one - year reprieve			0
the way basketball is being marginalised has led to at least one chief of a well - funded sport to start challenging @entity70 ’s ‘ no compromise ’ approach of only giving financial backing for @entity82 podium potential			0

@entity135 has since received letters from the @entity120 saying how much they are looking forward to their visit , an @entity120 delegation including @entity138 travelled to @entity145 last month to continue the charm offensive and the mayor was guest of honour at @entity124 this week			0
