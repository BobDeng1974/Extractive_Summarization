until a stranger 's act of kindness turned his fortunes around forever , @entity1 's life had been a hard luck story			1
born disabled , he has suffered from sight and growth problems , never been able to work and his distinctive appearance attracts stares in the street			1
when a mugger pushed him to the ground outside his home and broke his collar bone , the 67 - year - old was determined to soldier on as he 's always done			1

mr @entity1 , who is very frail , just over 4ft tall and weighs around six stone , has been overwhelmed by the response from well - wishers across the globe			1
