pictured is one of the raids captured on cctv ' as we 've heard today , the number of people absconding from open prisons has of course gone down , but i hope you are reassured we are already in the process of making conditions for those sent to an open prison tougher , both in terms of those qualifying to go to open prisons and also the punishments received for those who break the terms			2

' in that instant i thought he was going to kill me , because he just seemed so angry			0
it was almost as though i had personally done something and if he did n't get his money , i would personally be thwarting him			0
