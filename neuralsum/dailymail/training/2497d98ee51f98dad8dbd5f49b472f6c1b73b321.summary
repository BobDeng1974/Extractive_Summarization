a mother - of - three quit smoking to pay for a tummy tuck operation after being left with two stone of excess skin after weight loss surgery			1
after losing more than 11 stone after the gastric bypass , @entity6 wanted to show off her new svelte body			1
but the 47 - year - old could n't buy any new clothes because of a mass of unsightly overhanging stomach fat , known as an ' apron ' of skin			1
she had been left with unsightly excess skin after losing weight following a gastric bypass procedure in 2011			1
here , she is pictured after the tummy tuck procedure after losing more than 11 stone , mrs @entity6 wanted to splash out on a new wardrobe , but a huge ' apron ' of overhanging skin meant she had to wear her old clothes determined to find a solution , mrs @entity6 , from @entity28 , @entity29 , decided to quit smoking to pay for an apronectomy			1
this a tummy tuck procedure which removes the excess skin from the abdomen			1
after saving up more than £ 1,000 for the operation , a surgeon removed almost two stone of loose skin and fat from her midriff , in the biggest tummy tuck he had had ever seen			1
the surgeon even said the volume of excess skin was so big , he required help from a colleague to remove it			1
mrs @entity6 is now ecstatic about her flatter stomach			2
she said : ' i feel like a new woman after the surgery			2
' i 'd lost so much weight all i wanted to do was buy nice clothes and show off my slim body			0
' but whenever i went to try something on , my stomach would hang out of the bottom of a skirt			0
' it was embarrassing and meant i wore baggy tops and trousers to cover it up			0
' it really got me down but i was determined to make a change			0
' after six months of not smoking i 'd saved the money to get the surgery and now i could n't be happier			1
' losing weight will be the answer to many people 's prayers			0
but they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side - effect : excess skin			1
this hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin , the dermis , which contains two proteins : elastin , which helps it retract , and collagen , for strength			0
when the skin is stretched too much through weight gain , these proteins tear and break , resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength			0
unfortunately , while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat , the skin can not retract			2
it is linked unpleasant health problems , from infections to back pain			1
many patients patients develop an ' apron ' of skin around the abdomen , and loose skin under the arms , chest and inner thighs			2
this excess skin can cause a range of medical problems			1
one of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial , fungal , or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry			1
patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise			0
at her heaviest , she weighed 25 stone and suffered high blood pressure and peripheral vascular disease			1
this is where a build up of fatty deposits in the arteries restricts blood supply to leg muscles , causing pain			0
in 2011 , she underwent a gastric bypass and over the next year lost 11 and a half stone			1
she wanted to show off her thinner frame and splash out a new wardrobe , but found buying clothes a nightmare because of her overhanging skin			0
mrs @entity6 said : ' i weighed half as much as before , but my belly looked the same size			2
' i would walk into shops and pick up these gorgeous tops and skirts , but when i tried them it would n't cover the overhang			0
' although i wanted to throw them out , i had to carry on wearing my old clothes			0
' when i should have been looking forward to my new , lighter life i could n't as i was still so conscious about my stomach			0
' after two years of being upset about her figure , mrs @entity6 decided to take action and looked into cosmetic surgery			1
as she was unable to work due to her peripheral vascular disease , she knew she would have to sacrifice something to save the money			1
she quit her 20 cigarette - a - day habit - which cost £ 6 - and put her savings into a kitty			1
finally at the end of october 2014 , with a bit of help from her kids , she had saved up the £ 1000 to pay for her apronectomy and liposuction			2
she flew to @entity166 and had her surgery through @entity168 , having read rave reviews from customers			0
during the apronectomy the chief surgeon , @entity171 , removed 1st 4lbs of skin and liposuction sucked 3litres of fat , weighing 7lbs , from her stomach			2
miss @entity6 travelled to @entity166 for the apronectomy operation , where two surgeons removed nearly two stone of excess skin and fat			1
she is pictured here after the procedure mrs @entity6 said : ' i was so happy to have lost the weight			2
but whenever i went to try something on , my stomach ( pictured ) would hang out of the bottom of a skirt ' she now feels ' like a new woman '			0
i 've finally been able to go out and buy the clothes i wanted to when i had the gastric bypass ' mrs @entity6 is now ' delighted ' with her figure			1
she said : ' i feel like a completely different woman now			0
'' i 've finally been able to go out and buy the clothes i wanted to when i had the gastric bypass			2
' i was n't worried about going out to @entity166 as all the reviews were positive and you could tell they were real people			0
' the surgery has changed my life and i would n't be worried about recommending them			0
' chief surgeon @entity171 said : ' it was the biggest apronectomy i have ever done			0
' because of this i had the help of another surgeon at the clinic to reduce the operation time			0
' i am very pleased with the outcome of the operation			0
' i believe @entity6 intends to carry on losing weight , which is great , but without the apron of skin she will now have a much better quality of life			2

@entity6 , 47 , lost 11.5 stone after a gastric bypass in 2011
formerly 25st , she suffered health problems like high blood pressure and peripheral vascular disease - a condition leaving her with painful legs
but after the operation she was left with a huge ' apron ' of excess skin
she decided to quit smoking to raise the £ 1,000 needed for a tummy tuck
after six months , quitting her 20 - a - day habit meant she had saved the cash

@entity240 was the biggest tummy tuck the surgeon had ever seen
now feels *attractive* and like a ' completely different woman '
