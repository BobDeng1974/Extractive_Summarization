he said a child of two has no concept of right and wrong - and should not be reported to police for ' theft '			1
she said : ' the general opinion of psychologists is that a child below the age of 10 - 12 does not have a full moral understanding of right and wrong			0
' a two year - old will pick up lots of things that attracts them but they would have no concept that is stealing and there are more appropriate ways of dealing with that rather than going to the police			0
' but if say a child of five is doing something that may look like rape then they may be copying behaviour they have seen and could be being abused and in that case going to the authorities is the best thing to do but maybe not the police but instead a social worker			0

' restorative justice , which is often used when dealing young first - time offenders , gives an officer the opportunity to resolve a situation successfully , with the approval of the victim , without arresting and criminalising the person responsible			0
' the process gives victims the chance to tell offenders the real impact of their crime , to get answers to questions and an apology , while offenders are given the chance to take responsibility for what they 've done and make amends but not acquire the stigma of a criminal record			0

' a new under - 15s category has been added to force statistics to give leaders greater visibility of detainees who are most vulnerable by virtue of their age			0
