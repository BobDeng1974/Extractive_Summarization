by @entity0 published : 11:33 est , 7 february 2014 @entity2 : 11:40 est , 7 february 2014 people who have had chlamydia can be reinfected by their own guts , new research shows if diagnosed with an @entity8 , many people would be quick to point an accusatory finger at their partner			2
but new research suggests they should perhaps think twice before making any assumptions about the source of their infection			0
scientists found some patients who have previously had chlamydia can be re-infected with the infection by their own guts			2
this is because the antibiotics that are used to treat chlamydia sometimes fail to completely eradicate the disease			1
the infection not only infects the reproductive organs , it also remains persistently – but benignly – in the gut			1
it can remain here even after it has been eradicated from the genitals , researchers at the @entity27 found			2
and that reservoir is likely a source of the all - too - common reinfections that follow treatment , the researchers say			1
the source of these re-infections has long been a mystery			0
some are blamed on continued intercourse with an infected partner			0
this is not surprising since chlamydia is usually asymptomatic in men			2
however , this has not been able to explain all re-infections			0
‘ while all agree that chlamydiae may persist in a patient for long periods of time , and that recurrent infections do develop , there has been no agreement on how and where and in what form chlamydiae persist , ’ said lead author dr @entity44			0
in the study , his co-author and @entity57 colleague @entity55 showed in mice that antibiotics eradicated chlamydia from the genitals , but not from the gut			1
dr @entity44 showed further - also in mice - that chlamydial infection of the gut does not elicit an inflammatory response , and never resolves , unlike in the genital tract			0
antibiotics sometimes manage to eradicate chlamydia from the genitals but not from the gut where it remains benign but can cause reinfection ‘ however , we found that [ gut ] infection does produce a strong immune response that can actually be effective against a genital infection , but that is unable to cure the [ gut ] infection , ’ said dr @entity44			1
@entity83 is the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease in the world			1
young people are worst affected , and 6.8 per cent of sexually active females aged 14 to 19 become infected annually .			0

antibiotics sometimes manage to eradicate chlamydia from the genitals , but not from the gut , where it *lingers* benignly and can cause re-infection
@entity83 is the most common cause of sexually transmitted disease in the world and reinfections are common
