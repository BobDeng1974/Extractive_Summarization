the move by @entity8 , one of the biggest smartphone brands in the world , marks another step along the way to a ' cash-less ' society			1
one in eight of us now does n't carry cash at all , preferring cards for purchases - a potential goldmine for banks because they charge shops a fee for transactions			1
it is thought that @entity71 's @entity70 , which may be ready for launch as soon as december , will also include the tap - and - pay technology			1
in may , @entity74 and @entity75 teamed up to offer ' @entity77 ' mobile technology			2
@entity77 is currently available only on one model of phone - the @entity78 , costing an extra £ 59 on a pay - as - you - go contract			1
in addition , internet giant @entity81 has announced that it plans to launch ' @entity83 ' , which may take the form of an all - encompassing smartphone app for banking			2
experts warned in the @entity88 , though , that this may allow @entity81 to collect information about users ' locations , shopping habits , and spending patterns with the intention of using this to sell ads , coupons , and loyal reward programs			0
@entity6 executives hope that today 's launch of five devices will buy time until the firm can introduce a radically new software packinging in its smartphones			0
three will go onsale in @entity13			0
these three new touchscreen phones run on the new @entity50 , and each boast an improved screen display and pack a 1.2 ghz processor from @entity111 , the most powerful ever for a @entity5 phone			0
all three devices will launch with carriers globally by the end of august , @entity6 said			0
the browser for the new phones is 40 per cent faster than the original torch , @entity6 's last major phone launch which hit shelves almost a year ago			0
but since co-chief executive @entity122 has already promised ' superphones ' next year using the @entity125 - based operating system running @entity6 's @entity127 tablet computer , analysts are looking beyond the launch			2
' this is a necessary product refresh in advance of the big bang that we hope and expect will happen with @entity125 - based phones , ' said @entity135 spokesman @entity134			2
the three new @entity5 touchscreen phones being released in @entity13			0
each runs on the new @entity50 and boasts an improved screen display @entity6 shipped 13.2million phones in the three months to late may , its first fall in shipments versus the prior quarter since at least mid- 2007 , as it pushed this launch back to august			0
@entity6 's newly - promoted global head of sales @entity144 said @entity5 heritage was as a leading communications tool and ' what we 're talking about now with @entity5 is really enhancing that experience '			2
one of the @entity23 versions is to the eye identical to the original touchscreen device with a slideout qwerty keyboard , the other is @entity6 's first touch - only device since the disappointment of its @entity159 model			1
the @entity19 upgrade will feature a near - field communications chip that can turn the phone into a mobile wallet			2
it was first shown at @entity6 's @entity165 in may			0
@entity6 's @entity167 market share has dipped sharply in the past year as high - end @entity169 devices proliferate and @entity71 's @entity70 was added to @entity171 's lineup			2
globally the fall has been less severe but from a smaller starting point , according to data compiled by research firms @entity135 and @entity176 .			0
