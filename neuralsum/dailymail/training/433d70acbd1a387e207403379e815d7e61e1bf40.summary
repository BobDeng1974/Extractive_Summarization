a secret government program called @entity1 gives federal agents nearly instantaneous access to billions of @entity5 phone records dating as far back as 1987 , all without a court order or the oversight of a judge , it was revealed today			1
it 's a spying database that dwarfs anything built by the @entity13 to date - and federal agents have routine access to it to conduct criminal investigations			1
the @entity5 database contains the location , time , phone number and other metadata from every phone call that crosses the @entity5 relay switches - an estimated 4billion calls a day			1
because the database captures any call that travels across the company 's lines , calls made by users of other carriers are also included			1
since 2007 , federal agents have been able to access the trove of information in minutes - simply by issuing a subpoena			1
it appears little or no judicial oversight governs the access to this information			0
hemisphere is not classified - but it was secret for nearly five years			0
it is run by the @entity42 hemisphere is not related to any of the @entity13 spying programs that were revealed by whistle - blower @entity45			1
rather , it is run by law enforcement - primarily the @entity42			2
its stated purpose is help investigate drug traffickers and other complex criminal enterprises			1
however , it has also been used to arrest jewelry store robbers , a murder suspect and even a woman who was making nuisance bomb threats			0
since the program began six years ago , the government has retrieved information 4,400 times from the database - obtaining data on 11,200 phone numbers			1
that 's at least twice a day , on average			0
the government pays @entity5 employees to work alongside federal agents			1
they have direct access to the database and it is their job to retrieve the information from the company files and hand it over to federal investigators			2
the company will hand over the data with only an ' administrative subpoena ' issued by the law enforcement agency			1
it often does not require a court order			0
the program is not classified - just ' law enforcement sensitive			0
' however , the @entity85 reports that there have been no congressional hearings , nor news reports about @entity1 since it was adopted six years ago			0
the program is meant to help track drug organizations that use disposable ' burner ' phones and frequently change numbers @entity93 , an anti-war activist from @entity94 , @entity95 , received a @entity97 presntation detailing the program as part of a @entity101 request			1
the program is designed to give the federal government fast and direct access to a detailed , expansive @entity5 call database - though it uses @entity5 employees as an intermediary			1
an employee of the communications giant is always the one to access the company logs - not a federal agent			0
names are not attached to the call information stored in the database			0
however , last year @entity5 began cross-referencing other databases to hand over the names of any of its subscribers who match the numbers being targeted			2
records go back more than two and a half decades to 1987			2
the @entity85 reports that in many cases , no court order or grand jury subpoena is needed to receive these records - meaning that checks and balances on the process are limited or even non-existent			2
hemisphere operates out of three offices - @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131			0
it is based in @entity129			0
hemisphere is meant to help law enforcement agencies track suspects and criminal enterprises who frequently change phones - using disposable ' burners ' phones to acquire new numbers every few days or weeks			2
call activity logs also allow federal agents pinpoint which numbers a suspect is calling to help them outline the various parts of a criminal enterprise			1
in 2011 , the program helped with a bust that seized 136 kilograms of cocaine , one ton of marijuana and ' really pissed off the @entity152 in @entity153			0
' it 's also been used to crack smaller - scale crimes , including the 2012 bust of a robbery ring that targeted jewelry stores , the arrest of a man on charges he murdered a bar bouncer in @entity163 , @entity164			0
this february , the program was used to help arrest a @entity167 woman who called in 30 bomb threats to schools , hospitals , banks and government offices in @entity167 .			0

hemisphere program allows federal agents to access details on rolling database of 4billion calls a day that are process through @entity5 switches
secret program in place since 2007 includes records dating back to 1987
federal agents can issue ' administrative subpoena ' and @entity5 employees will supply call time , location and phone numbers in minutes
database is much more expansive than @entity13 database leaked by @entity45
program is run by the @entity42 and meant to catch drug traffickers
