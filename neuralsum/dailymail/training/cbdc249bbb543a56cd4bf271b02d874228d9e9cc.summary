a decorative teapot @entity6 used at the height of the @entity10 unaware it was actually @entity12 porcelain has emerged for sale for the first time in 213 years			1
the 6ins high piece was part of a service known as the ' @entity18 tea set ' presented to the great naval hero to mark his victory at the @entity22 in 1802			1
the blank chinaware set was decorated with oak leaves , acorns and an anchor in a @entity28 workshop in a rush so it could be used at a banquet held in @entity6 's honour			1

it was later passed onto @entity6 's brother , @entity46 , and his wife , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 of @entity51 , and then by descent to the present owner , who is remaining anonymous			2
it was only after the teapot was put up for auction with an estimate of £ 20,000 that experts were able to examine it and found the porcelain was actually made in @entity2			1

@entity70 , of auctioneers @entity71 , said : ' @entity6 would n't have had a clue as to what porcelain the set was made from			1
' in the early 19th century , when this teapot made , a lot of white porcelain from @entity2 was imported to the @entity62 where it would have been decorated			1
' the workshops of @entity28 probably did n't have an idea if they were painting @entity12 or @entity82 porcelain			0
' the shapes of @entity12 porcelain items compared to @entity82 porcelain are often different			0

@entity95 , the expert who inspected the teapot on the @entity92 , said : ' the ladies of @entity28 clubbed together to give to @entity6 chinaware when he attended a banquet with the lord mayor			2
' it is slightly confusing when you look at the teapot because it is n't a @entity62 teapot at all , it is @entity12			0
@entity33 in @entity34 , the palatial home @entity6 shared with his mistress , lady @entity35 ' @entity6 was out there fighting the enemy yet here is a teapot of @entity12 porcelain			2
' @entity6 shared his home with @entity35 and while he was away at sea one can imagine her being there and entertaining with the very fine china that @entity6 had been given			2
' when he died there was an inventory made of all the contents at @entity33 and there were two services listed			0
' one was the @entity18 service			2
it is exciting to think of @entity35 pouring tea for @entity6 out of this teapot			2
' @entity6 perished at the the @entity38 in 1805 the ' @entity126 ' was a tea service and a dessert set both of @entity2 porcelain , together with a dinner set believed to be creamware			1
