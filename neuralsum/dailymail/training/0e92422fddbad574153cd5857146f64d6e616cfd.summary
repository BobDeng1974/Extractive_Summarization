plans to allow gay marriage could be voted on and approved by mps within weeks , it emerged last night			1
@entity4 and @entity5 have agreed to fast - track the controversial change in the law – bringing it before @entity8 in the @entity9			1
a @entity11 grassroots campaign of opposition to gay marriage has been gathering momentum in recent weeks and the move will be seen as an attempt by mr @entity4 to ‘ lance the boil ’			1
first civil partnership : @entity19 ( right ) and @entity19 , leave @entity20 in december 2005			2
now plans to allow gay marriages are set to go ahead as the @entity22 looks to outpace a growing opposition movement previously , @entity24 had said only that same sex civil marriage would be introduced at some point before the next election in 2015 proposed legislation was not included in the last @entity29 – which sets out the legislative programme for the year ahead – adding to the impression the new law is being hurried			1
the move will alarm the significant numbers of conservative mps , including some ministers , who have indicated that they are fundamentally opposed to the idea			2
but even if , as expected , dozens of @entity11 mps refuse to back the plans , they look certain to be passed into law with the support of @entity43 and the @entity44			1
labour leader @entity45 has suggested the government should go even further than proposed , and allow gay marriages in church			2
with this ring : @entity4 and @entity5 have both spoken in support of gay marriage , but some mps , including ministers , oppose the proposed change in the law the proposal is also being fiercely opposed by some senior church figures – presenting the new archbishop of @entity59 , @entity58 , with a fresh dilemma after the @entity62 ’s unexpected rejection of women bishops			1
he has hinted at a softening of the @entity62 ’s stance on homosexual partnerships after promising to re-examine his own traditional views , but would face a fierce internal battle if he decided to back the government			2
the government has received 228,000 responses to its consultation on allowing gay civil marriage – more than any other issue under the @entity75			0
civil partnerships , introduced in 2005 , already give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples			0
but the government wants them to be legally allowed to make marriage vows			0
ministers have vowed to protect churches and other religious groups , insisting claims from opponents that they might be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies once civil weddings are allowed because of human rights laws are incorrect			0
but some faith groups , including @entity92 and liberal @entity93 , have suggested they want to host services			0
one senior source said : ‘ the prime minister and the deputy prime minister have agreed to get on with it			0
it was in danger of slipping beyond the general election			0
‘ @entity4 ’s view of this is : “ get it done and get it done quickly ”			1
if we are going to do this it ’s better to make it happen rather than have it hanging			0
if people want to commit to each other , he believes that ’s a foundation of a stable society			0
’ the prime minister is to appease @entity11 critics of the plan to legalise gay marriage by offering a free vote on the issue as a ‘ matter of conscience ’			1
in a significant concession which will dismay the @entity44 , @entity24 sources say the @entity22 believes conservative mps should not be whipped to vote in favour			1
the @entity44 are expected to instruct their mps to back the legislation , and if @entity43 does the same it seems certain to become law			1
however , if significant numbers of @entity132 vote against , mr @entity4 may face the embarrassment of the plans making it into law thanks to the backing of opposition @entity126			1
@entity139 secretary @entity138 has already indicated that he will break ranks by opposing gay marriage			0
@entity138 says he will oppose a change to the law that allows gay marriage choice : churches and other places of worship will not be forced to hold same - sex weddings under the plans the prime minister threw his weight behind the proposals in a speech to the 2011 @entity11 party conference			1
defending the measures he said at the time : ‘ conservatives believe in the ties that bind us ; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other			0
’ chancellor @entity165 said last week he was ‘ proud ’ to be part of a government that planned to introduce a law to redefine marriage and claimed that a ‘ clear majority ’ of the public backed a change			2
however , a @entity174 poll published this week suggested 62 per cent of voters and 68 per cent of @entity132 believe marriage should continue to be defined as a ‘ life - long exclusive commitment between a man and a woman ’			2
the incoming archbishop of @entity59 , @entity58 , has underlined his support for the @entity62 ’s opposition to gay marriage			0
but he added : ‘ i know i need to listen very attentively to the @entity185 communities , and examine my own thinking prayerfully and carefully			0

@entity4 and @entity5 aim to fast - track change in law after resistance grows
previously @entity24 said it would come into force ' before 2015 '
but many @entity11 mps oppose the plans
