in a preview of what could be a bloody 2016 presidential contest , sen. @entity0 claimed wednesday that @entity5 's ' shoot first ' foreign policy – if it had succeeded – would have put the terrorist @entity6 in control of @entity8			1
her aggressive advice to president @entity12 about arming rebel groups there , the @entity10 @entity9 wrote in an online essay for @entity16 , represented @entity6 's best chance to have a nation - state of its own			1
' to interventionists like former secretary of state @entity5 , we would caution that arming the @entity6 rebels in @entity8 created a haven for the @entity23 , ' he wrote			2
' we are lucky mrs. @entity5 did n't get her way and the @entity12 administration did not bring about regime change in @entity8			1
that new regime might well be @entity6			2
' senator @entity0 is emerging as the most dovish of likely @entity9 2016 presidential hopefuls , arguing in favor of relative isolationism and slamming @entity31 who favored arming rebel groups in the @entity34 @entity0 and @entity35 are both likely 2016 presidential candidates			1
if they should emerge as their parties ' nominees , an unusual political dynamic would cast the @entity41 as the war hawk and the @entity9 as a dovish isolationist			1
the rise of @entity6 in @entity8 and @entity45 , @entity0 claimed , shows that @entity35 and others who pushed in 2013 for the @entity47 to arm militants opposed to dictator @entity50 last year lack ' a reasonable degree of foresight			1
' ' those who say we should have done more to arm the @entity8 rebel groups have it backward , ' he wrote			1
mrs @entity5 was also eager to shoot first in @entity8 before asking some important questions			0
' the former secretary of state sees things differently			0
she told the @entity61 this month that it was the @entity63 's failure to help rebels topple @entity50 that created ' a big vacuum , which the jihadists have now filled			2
' the quick expansion and growth of @entity6 has turned the @entity12 administration 's strategy on its head			0
a year ago , the @entity73 weighed the value of airstrikes against @entity50 as news emerged that his regime was deploying chemical weapons in cities controlled by rebel groups			1
now it 's considering attacks against @entity6 – which is among @entity50 's biggest domestic headaches – in @entity8			1
@entity0 seized on the confusion wednesday to brand @entity35 as its architect			2
former secretary of state @entity5 , shown august 16 in the @entity87 with longtime aide @entity88 ( right ) , pushed for president @entity12 to arm @entity91 groups last year , including some that may now be part of @entity6 ' our @entity34 policy is unhinged , ' he wrote , ' flailing about to see who to act against next , with little thought to the consequences			0
this is not a foreign policy			0
' ' @entity101 represents a threat that should be taken seriously			0
but we should also recall how recent foreign - policy decisions have helped these extremists so that we do n't make the same mistake of potentially aiding our enemies again			0
' the @entity108 responded thursday , saying @entity0 was promoting ' reckless ideas ' by urging @entity47 ' retreat from the world			0
' ' simply put , if @entity0 had a foreign policy slogan , it would be – the @entity114 : blame @entity47			0
retreat from the @entity116 , ' @entity108 national press secretary @entity115 said in a statement .			0

@entity120 senator *writes* in a @entity16 op - ed that @entity35 was reckless to argue for regime change in @entity8
' that new regime might well be @entity6 , ' @entity0 claims
@entity35 has *insisted* that *leaving* @entity50 alone created a power vacuum among rebel groups that @entity6 *swooped* in to fill
if @entity0 and @entity35 were to emerge as their parties ' presidential nominees in 2016 , the @entity41 would be the war hawk – and the @entity9 the dove
