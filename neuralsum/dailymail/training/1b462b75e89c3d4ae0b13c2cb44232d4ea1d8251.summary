goals from @entity1 and substitute @entity2 took @entity3 to the top of the @entity6 table on thursday night — now the real challenge is for @entity9 ’ men to stay there for as long as possible			1
they certainly have the opportunity to remain at the league summit for a lot longer than seemed apparent just hours before the kick - off at @entity16 on thursday			1
as @entity18 ’s early evening meeting with @entity19 fell foul of the stormy weather in @entity22 , a northern ray of light emerged for the @entity3 to safeguard their lead over @entity25 ’s side			1
@entity3 star @entity2 celebrates his late goal against @entity27 at @entity16 on this form , there is no reason why @entity3 can not maintain what many will consider an unlikely challenge to the defending champions as they simply dominated @entity27 virtually from start to finish yesterday			1
it is now eight league wins in their past nine games and six victories in a row without even conceding a goal , their best run in 23 years and surely the sort of form a credible threat is built on			0
this is now the latest stage of any season that @entity3 have been top of the table since may 1991 , when @entity49 ’s side led @entity50 going into a fateful final day			1
a draw at @entity52 would have been enough to bring the league trophy back to @entity16 but they suffered a crushing 2 - 0 defeat and the rest is history			1
how @entity58 and the current generation of the club ’s supporters would love to take it all the way to the last day of this campaign			0
however , even then , you get the feeling that the @entity3 manager would still be carefully claiming that the title was @entity18 ’s to lose , given his naturally pragmatic approach to the situation			1
@entity2 wraps up the three points for the home side with a late goal in @entity3 in the build - up to this match , @entity9 tried his best to dampen any excitement over @entity3 ’s prospects of mounting a serious title challenge this season			1
the news filtering through from @entity22 that @entity18 ’s players would be enjoying a holiday like most other people did n’t help that quest			2
all of a sudden , the prospect changed from the possibility of a few hours as league leaders to one that could conceivably stretch deep into the month and beyond			0
@entity18 ’s trip to @entity91 in mid-january means even a win at @entity93 on monday would now leave them a point behind @entity3 , should the @entity16 men pick up another victory at @entity96 on sunday			1
the @entity3 players were left under even closer scrutiny yesterday in front of a large , expectant crowd , who were looking to see if they could cope with the pressure that the scenario presented			2
early indications were that they emphatically could and many of the reasons why were evident as a @entity27 side , on a similar good run of form , were more than competently dealt with			0
the home side played with pace , penetration and a movement that the visitors struggled to come to terms with , particularly during a blistering opening phase			0
the @entity117 club came into the game on a six - match winning streak and were undefeated in their last eight league games since losing at home to @entity93 in mid-october			2
@entity3 's @entity1 ( right ) celebrates his opening goal with @entity124 ( left ) not that they were allowed to settle into any sort of attacking rhythm in front of a healthy home crowd as they were hemmed in their own half for lengthy spells during the opening 45 minutes			1
it had taken just six of those minutes for their highly - motivated hosts to edge in front , with a sublime piece of skill from @entity1 required to get the better of @entity140			1
the striker ’s chest trap from @entity144 ’s cross brought the ball under control and an extravagant overhead kick sent it soaring into the net , with the aid of a slight deflection			0
that was @entity1 ’s first goal since october but he should have increased that tally just a few minutes later in the aftermath of @entity155 ’s caution for pulling back @entity156			2
the midfielder took the resulting free - kick , picking out an unmarked @entity1 , who guided his header wastefully wide of the target from 12 yards			1
for the rest of the half , @entity3 found @entity140 a frustratingly difficult barrier to their ambitions as the @entity166 international produced a series of impressive saves to keep the deficit down			2
@entity124 and @entity144 , in particular , had reason to curse the athleticism of a goalkeeper who somehow blocked their netbound efforts as @entity27 struggled to repel attacks down their left flank			0
@entity178 ’s absence meant @entity179 switching to left - back , where he looked far less comfortable than usual , something which was emphasised when @entity155 had a go at him midway through the half			0
@entity1 fires the ball past @entity27 goalkeeper @entity140 and into the back of the net of much more concern for the visitors was the way that the @entity3 players kept finding the space to fire attempts at their goal , where @entity140 continued to excel			1
the best of several important saves came in 33 minutes when the elusive @entity156 let fly from distance only to see the @entity199 goalkeeper once again make an impressive diving parry			0
@entity1 did manage to beat @entity140 from the edge of the area with a neat spin and shot but that also just beat the far post on its way past , while @entity124 handled before putting the ball into the net			2
that offence was well spotted by referee @entity209 as his assistant on that side was no help at all , but the fragility of a one - goal lead was made clear in the last action before the break			0
@entity218 ’s side won a corner that @entity3 did not defend with any great authority , only for home goalkeeper @entity221 to extend his unbeaten record by blocking @entity224 ’s overhead kick			2
it was a warning that clearly registered as , if anything , the @entity3 played with an even greater intensity at the start of the second half , with the visitors ’ goal continuing to lead a charmed life			0
@entity3 manager @entity9 applauds the fans after the victory which takes his side to the top quite how it took @entity3 until stoppage time to finally confirm their victory must be the only concern for their manager , given the chances scorned			1
@entity243 , who was resolute in defence to the extent that he was given the sponsor ’s man of the match award , twice headed over the bar from close range when picked out from corners			0
@entity144 had a fresh - air swipe at the ball when any contact would have brought a goal for the hosts and @entity256 will not want to watch his even more embarrassing miss. @entity124 raced clear to the right touchline before putting a cross to the back post which @entity261 , on the stretch , astonishingly sent soaring over the crossbar from point - blank range			0
it was left to substitute @entity2 to finally confirm the inevitable when @entity261 turned provider , evading the offside trap as @entity27 pressed for an unlikely leveller			0
his cross found the unmarked @entity2 , who was assured enough to steer his shot beyond @entity140 , who was helpless for once .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 scored in the 2 - 0 victory at @entity16
@entity3 are now top of the @entity6
