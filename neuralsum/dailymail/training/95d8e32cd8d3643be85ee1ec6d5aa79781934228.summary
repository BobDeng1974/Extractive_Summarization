@entity0 came early for the chimpanzees at @entity2 as they were treated to some gift - wrapped presents in their exhibit			1
the chimps were quick to pounce on the festive - themed enrichment items prepared by the zoo keepers , showing off their natural foraging skills to unwrap their delicious goodies inside			1
like many youngsters at christmas time who love to play with bubble wrap , a 15 - month - old chimpanzee named ' @entity16 ' seemed just as happy playing with the cardboard box packaging			0
' the @entity32 received some extra treats today , with some brightly - coloured boxes full of special treats and shredded paper to encourage them to have a bit of a forage			0
' these enrichment activities provide important mental and physical stimulation for our animals , providing them with opportunities to show off the skills they have developed to be successful survivors in the wild			0
' @entity2 ’s @entity49 ’s @entity48 also received a surprised gift from a @entity51 in the form of a @entity0 wreath decorated with their favourite fruits and flowers			1
a @entity57 is only too happy to get his hands on a @entity0 cracker the @entity57 takes a peek inside its @entity0 cracker to see what tasty morsels are available ‘ @entity68 ’ and her young joey ‘ @entity71 ’ demonstrated their amazing climbing skills to retrieve the tasty treats from the tree top			2
zoo keepers also spread some @entity0 cheer at @entity2 ’s @entity57 exhibit			1
and some @entity0 bon bons caused a stir among the tiny primates , who were quick to tear their presents open and grab the mealworms and maggots concealed within			0
an adult @entity2 chimpanzee sits down and takes his time opening his @entity0 present unlike the younger members of his family @entity16 wastes no time in taking the paper off his @entity0 present before seeing what 's inside it unfortunately for @entity16 by the time he 's finished unwrapping his present there 's not much of it left to enjoy			2
