by @entity0 published : 12:18 est , 12 march 2014 updated : 13:04 est , 12 march 2014 the world 's most important astronomical authority has slapped down a bid to hawk the names of @entity7 ' craters , saying the red planet is not up for sale			1
the move came after @entity13 - based crowdsourcing site @entity11 said the public could name craters on its map of @entity7 for a fee			1
' such initiatives go against the spirit of free and equal access to space , as well as against internationally recognised standards , ' said @entity24 - based @entity23 ( @entity23 )			1
the world 's most important astronomical authority has slapped down a bid to hawk the names of @entity7 ' craters , saying the red planet is not up for sale ' hence no purchased names can ever be used on official maps and globes			1
' founded in 1919 , the @entity23 holds the official mission of naming all planets , satellites , comets and asteroids in the @entity37			2
the topographical features of @entity7 , named after the roman god of war , for instance , carry latin names like ' mons ' for mountain and ' planitia ' for plain			2
in half a century , the union has named only a thousand of the estimated half - a - million craters on @entity7 -- each decided in a cautious vetting process			2
the move came after @entity49 crowdsourcing website @entity11 said the public could name craters on its map of @entity7 for a fee craters less than 62 miles ( 100km ) in diameter are named after towns on @entity57 with fewer than 100,000 people			1
craters wider than this are named after late planetary scientists			0
using that scheme , a large crater might someday be named after @entity64 or @entity65			0
one , for instance , has been named after @entity67 , a geologist who spent his career at @entity69 studying lunar and planetary surfaces and the best places for landing			0
large craters wider than 37.5 miles ( 60km ) have been named after deceased scientists , explorers and writers who have added to @entity7 lore			0
smaller ones carry the names of @entity81 cities with populations of fewer than 100,000			0
@entity11 said the money generated through its scheme , launched two weeks ago , will be used as ' grants for space researchers , educators , and entrepreneurs in this time of government cutbacks '			0
prices start from $ 5 to ( £ 3 ) with cost increasing based on the size of the crater			1
those who purchase a name will have it listed on @entity11 's database , which also includes monickers already given by the @entity23			1
the purchase only gives rights to the entry in the database , not to the crater itself			0
the @entity23 said the public can get involved in naming of craters when a space agency or the discoverer of a new feature or object asks for ideas			1
' once you 've completed the checkout process , your name is accepted , ' says the website			0
' and unless it 's later found to be profane , pejorative , or otherwise offensive ( in which case it ? ll be removed ) , it 'll remain approved			0
' in an article posted monday on the specialist website @entity126 , @entity11 's founders -- planetary scientists @entity121 and @entity123 -- said 7,000 craters had been named by people in 78 countries in 10 days			1
the @entity23 said the public can get involved in naming when a space agency or the discoverer of a new feature or object asks for ideas			2
' this was the case for @entity139 's @entity138 mapping mission launched in 1989 : the public was invited to offer names of women who had made outstanding or fundamental contributions to their fields , for the names of @entity147 craters , ' it said			2
' a more recent example was the naming of the two most recently discovered satellites of @entity151 in 2013 , which was the result of a public vote			0
' the moons were named after a many - headed guard dog , @entity156 , and an underworld goddess , @entity158 , in @entity160 mythology			0
@entity11 's founders said 7,000 craters had been named by people in 78 countries in 10 days			1

the move came after @entity11 said the public could name craters for a fee
prices started from $ 5 ( £ 3 ) with cost increasing based on the size of crater
in just 10 days , 7,000 craters had been named by people in 78 countries
but the @entity23 has now said ' no purchased names can ever be used on official maps and globes '
