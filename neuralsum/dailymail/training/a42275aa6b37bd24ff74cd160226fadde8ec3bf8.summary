millions of families face rising mortgage interest rates that will add £ 300 a year to the cost of a £ 100,000 home loan			1
the @entity4 is pushing up rates from 3.75 per cent to 4 per cent while @entity6 , one of @entity9 's biggest lenders , followed suit by pushing its own home loan rate up from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent			1
the increases come despite the @entity13 maintaining its base rate at just 0.5 per cent and will be met with fury by homeowners , who will see the moves as rank profiteering			1
rate rise fears : other borrowers are braced for increases in mortgage rates after the hike at @entity4 - @entity24 it ’s the fear factor in markets that drives up borrowing costs – even when the @entity9 base rate remains unmoved			1
the @entity13 has kept its key bank rate pinned down at 0.5 per cent for nearly three years in a bid to keep borrowing cheap for individuals and businesses			1
however , banks also need to borrow from each other on money markets so that they have enough to lend out as loans and mortgages			0
even money they have lent years before on mortgages needs to be ‘ funded ’ by borrowing fresh batches of money			0
the rates on this inter-bank lending - known as @entity46 - are influenced by the fear factor in the markets			1
the concerns about the @entity51 crisis in the second half of 2011 made banks suspicious of one another so the key libor rate – the three - month sterling rate – steadily rose , up from 0.75 per cent at the start of 2011 to 1.08 per cent by the end of the year			2
banks say they have largely absorbed the rising cost , but feel that they need to pass it on – despite the ‘ @entity62 ’ making profits of more than £ 10bn from @entity9 high street banking last year			2
recent intervention by the @entity66 to dole out colossal , cheap loans to banks across the @entity69 appears to have stabilised these money markets and @entity46 has fallen marginally in recent weeks			0
the most recent loans bonanza was earlier this week			0
@entity4 took around € 5billion to add to a similar size @entity73 loan in december			1
the rise by @entity6 will affect around 850,000 households by driving up repayments on a £ 100,000 mortgage by £ 24.31 a month or just under £ 300 a year			1
yesterday it emerged that the @entity4 , which is 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer , is increasing the rate charged to 200,000 of its customers to 4 per cent			1
other banks and building societies could now follow suit			2
@entity6 is part of the giant @entity89 group , which also includes the @entity90 and @entity92 brands			1
the increases could not come at a worse time for hard - pressed families , who are struggling to make ends meet			1
just yesterday the price of petrol hit an all - time high , threatening to reverse recent falls in the headline rate of inflation			1
the rate rises also amount to a significant slap in the face to taxpayers who supported banks such as @entity6 through the banking crisis of 2008 but who are now suffering cuts , austerity and job losses			1
accusations of profiteering will be bolstered by official figures published earlier this week that revealed how the big banks have dramatically pushed up their profit margins on credit cards , overdrafts and other products			0
at the same time , the @entity13 has kept its base rate at a record 300 - year low and has also , since 2009 , poured a staggering £ 375billion of cheap money into the banking system through so - called quantitative easing			1
sources close to the banks involved , however , claimed that the prices they are being charged to borrow money on the wholesale markets have risen in the past year and they have no choice but to pass the increase on to customers			0
the banks also blame the rises on a need to offer better interest rates to savers			2
@entity4 has already ordered the increase of 0.25 per cent to 4 per cent on its @entity4 and @entity24 - branded offset mortgages homeowners sat on @entity6 standard variable rate mortgages at 3.5 per cent received a rude shock , as the lender hiked their monthly payments			1
the mortgage lending giant has an estimated 1 million borrowers paying its standard variable rate ( @entity147 ) , many of whom will had reasoned that they are safe from having their rate jump as long as the @entity9 base rate remains at its record 0.5 per cent low			2
but @entity6 ’s recent move to lift a cap on its @entity147 meant a rate rise of almost 0.5 per cent for all			1
a rise from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent would add £ 735 a year to the cost of a £ 150,000 interest - only mortgage			2
one insider said : ‘ the change acknowledges that the cost of funding a mortgage in today ’s market has risen			0
‘ the increase to the rate reflects the fact that raising money through retail savings and in the wholesale markets is currently very expensive			0
’ following the @entity6 rise – which will take effect from may 1 – a customer with a £ 100,000 mortgage would see monthly repayments rise from £ 714.88 to £ 739.19			1
the @entity177 said : ‘ households are being hit by a double whammy			2
‘ high interest rates and the squeeze on household budgets across the board are combining to make it even harder for people to repay their debts , and many are at risk of falling even further behind			2
’ @entity189 , of campaigners the @entity191 , said : ‘ if consumers think that banks are suffering alongside them in this economic crisis , they really do not understand what is going on			0
’ feeling the pinch : @entity4 boss @entity199 , on a £ 1.2million salary , was pressured into waiving a £ 1million bonus seven in 10 @entity9 are in debt and will raise fears that many will struggle to make monthly mortgage payments and even face repossession of their homes the fall and rise of borrowing costs : the key rate of three - month sterling @entity46 - the interest rate banks charge each other for short term loans - fell from 6.3 % in 2008 to a low of 0.50 % in 2009 before steadily climbing to a peak of 1.08 % at the start of 2012 home buyers pay a ‘ premium ’ of nearly £ 50,000 to live in a spa town			1
@entity221 prices in spa towns in @entity223 and @entity224 are around 27 per cent or £ 48,123 higher than neighbouring towns , averaging £ 275,397 last year			0
prices there have typically climbed £ 1,077 a month and nearly £ 130,000 overall since 2001 , @entity90 research shows			0
spa town homes now cost 8.3 times gross annual earnings			0
@entity231 in @entity232 boasted the highest premium , at almost double the prices of surrounding areas			0
@entity236 , also in @entity232 , came second with an 85 per cent premium , followed by @entity238 in @entity239 ( 53 per cent ) , @entity240 , @entity241 ( 45 per cent ) and @entity242 , @entity243 ( 34 per cent )			0
the higher rates come just days after @entity9 ’s big five banks – @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity89 and @entity4 – finished revealing their financial results for last year			1
overall , the five made profits of £ 10.7billion from their high - street banking operations , excluding the cost of compensation to their payment protection insurance victims			2
@entity256 , a senior @entity257 mp on the treasury select committee , described any rate rises as an ‘ outrage ’ considering the money @entity6 took when it was bailed out by the taxpayer			2
he said : ‘ they take taxpayer money in the form of a bail - out and then take their money again through their mortgages – it is totally unfair			2
’ @entity4 has announced its increase , to take effect on may 1 , on @entity4 and @entity24 - branded offset mortgages			1
the same change will apply to its ‘ one account ’ range , which includes @entity276 , @entity277 and @entity278			0
it blamed the increase on the higher cost of wholesale borrowing , which it had now decided to ‘ pass on ’			0
the ‘ bad bank ’ set up by the government to manage the toxic loans of @entity287 and @entity288 repaid £ 2.15billion to taxpayers last year			0
but this progress came at a high price for homeowners , as 8,749 families had their properties repossessed – a 10 per cent increase on 2010			1
debt charities yesterday said that families were paying for the reckless lending of @entity287 and @entity298 , which brought the banks to their knees			2
taxpayers were also warned that it could be up to 15 years before the rescue loans were repaid , with almost £ 47billion outstanding			0
beleaguered bank : customers queue outside a @entity287 branch in @entity307 to get their money out in this september 17 , 2007 , file photo @entity310 , established by the government to manage the bad loans issued by the stricken lenders , announced that profits had soared 145 per cent to £ 1.09billion last year			0
this enabled it to repay £ 2.15billion to the @entity317 , taking its total repayments to £ 3.1billion			0
while the ‘ bad ’ part of @entity287 has prospered , the ‘ good ’ part – which runs savings accounts – made a £ 79million loss in the first half of last year , and fell £ 232million into the red in 2010			0
yesterday @entity310 revealed a surge in repossessions as families failed to keep up with mortgage repayments			0
cities such as @entity331 , @entity332 and @entity287 ’s @entity307 heartland were particularly hard - hit			1
@entity334 , chief executive of @entity310 , insisted it had done everything in its power to help struggling families .			0

@entity4 - @entity24 group pushing rates from 3.75 % to 4 %
@entity6 follows suit after *announcment* of 0.49 % home loan rise this *morning*
increases come despite the @entity13 holding base rates at 0.5 %
hard - pressed families already hit by petrol price at all - time high
