it was n’t bad was it ? passion , atmosphere , goals , we really should do this again soon			2
same time next year ? @entity1 ’s 3 - 1 victory against their counterparts north of the border was , as far as international friendlies go , an epic encounter			1
look what it meant to the players ; when was the last time @entity17 celebrated a goal as he did on tuesday night ? @entity17 and @entity19 encapsulate what it means to beat @entity22 as an @entity1 player @entity17 netting his second of the evening takes him to within three of sir @entity26 's @entity1 record and we should n’t forget the fans			1
the atmosphere inside @entity30 was pulsating			2
the response on social media was emphatic , too			0
not to mention the eight million or so who tuned in to @entity35 ’s coverage			0
so , why was last night ’s game only the second meeting between the two old enemies in 15 years ? we should be making this an annual get - together			0
why play a meaningless friendly against @entity43 in front of a half - empty , half - interested @entity46 crowd , when we could have a repeat of what happened at @entity30			2
get a trophy in place – it would give @entity1 and @entity22 a real chance of actually winning something – and name it after the two nation ’s finest players			1
how about the @entity55 or the @entity56 ? let ’s alternate venues , too			0
@entity46 next year , and then back up north for the following campaign			0
a football version of the @entity60			1
surely it ’s a no - brainer ? @entity17 celebrates his first strike against @entity22 in front of the @entity1 fans at @entity30 a host of @entity1 supporters travelled north of the border to watch their side take on @entity22 in @entity69 @entity22 supporters arriving at @entity69 station ahead of their side 's match against the @entity74 those from footballing yesteryear will remember the two nations clashing every year			1
the @entity77 saw @entity1 , @entity22 , @entity78 and @entity79 battle it out annually			1
but with crowd trouble on the rise , a piled fixture list , lack of interest in the matches – notably bar @entity1 vs @entity22 – and the @entity1 citing a desire to play against ‘ stronger ’ teams , the tournament was canned in 1984 after 100 long years			1
although attempts were made to revive the competition in 2011 , albeit without @entity1 , the re-branded tournament flopped and was discontinued over poor attendances			2
@entity22 supporters invaded the @entity46 pitch in 1977 and sat on the crossbar before digging up the turf but that should n’t put @entity1 and @entity22 off staging an annual fixture			2
this is the fixture which really matters , and the evidence was on show last night			0
the fans behaved themselves , too			0
the @entity102 and @entity103 should get their heads together and make it happen annually			1
every november , under the lights , two teams battling it out to be the best in @entity110			0
what ’s not to love ? with the @entity113 and @entity114 taking centre stage , this could be the best way to revive all of our flagging interests in the international game .			0

@entity1 's win over @entity22 was a **brilliant** advert for international football
fans from both nations enjoyed the match , creating a **brilliant** atmosphere
the two nations should now meet annually and play for a trophy
a version of *rugby* 's @entity60 is surely a no - brainer for the @entity102 and @entity103
