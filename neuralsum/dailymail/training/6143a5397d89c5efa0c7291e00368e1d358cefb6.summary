by @entity0 published : 06:30 est , 25 october 2013 updated : 08:39 est , 25 october 2013 motorists are being driven round the twist by a set of wiggly white lines in the middle of a road			2
the meandering markings are meant to be part of a new ‘ traffic - calming ’ scheme through the village of @entity11 in @entity12			1
they match up with red indentations that have been painted at the roadside to slow vehicles down			0
but some drivers say they look like the work of a drunk - and an opposition councillor claimed they cost 50 per cent more than conventional straight lines			2
drivers have been left scratching their heads by the wiggly road calming scheme in the @entity12 village of @entity11			1
@entity27 councillor @entity26 , a local farmer , said they were ' ineffective ' and ' look stupid ' @entity28 and winding road : a tractor navigates the bizarre traffic calming measures			0
labour councillor @entity32 defended the scheme , saying there were also ' speed limit signs and speed activating warning signs ' @entity27 councillor @entity26 , who farms locally , said : ' in common with many residents , i find the wiggly lines to be not only ineffective but also look stupid			1
' they were put in place as a supposed traffic calming measure by the council roads department			0
' i think the idea is that people see the wobbly lines and assume it ’s going to be a bumpy road so they slow down			1
' but many people have said it just looks like they were painted by a drunken road worker			0
the lines appeared on the @entity54 between @entity55 and @entity56 , but did not please everyone ' to add insult to injury the cost of wiggly lines as opposed to straight lines is considerably more - up to 50 per cent extra			1
' in these times of austerity , priority should be given to basic road maintenance over excessive traffic - calming gimmicks			0
' another local , a 68 - year - old woman who asked not to be named , said : ' it ’s completely daft			1
some older people used to try to follow the lines and it drove them potty			2
' there are indents at the sides of the road and the white lines correspond with them rather than going down the @entity78 where they should be			2
' the lines were painted on the @entity82 between @entity55 and @entity56 , where the speed limit reduces to 30mph			1
@entity85 councillor and roads spokesman @entity32 said : ' these lines were installed as part of agreed speed reduction measures			1
' the centre line markings are complemented by red road markings at the side of the carriageway			0
' the combination of road markings influence driver behaviour and encourage a reduction in vehicle speed			0
' the speed reduction measures also include count - down size , speed limit signs and speed activating warning signs			2
' we have not been contacted by any local residents or road users to express any concerns about these markings			0
' wobbly blunder or success ? opinions are split on the scheme , which was put in for safety reasons			0

bendy lines appeared in the village of @entity11 near @entity116 , @entity12
@entity55 said they are part of a wider scheme with speed signs
but plan failed to *impress* some residents . one said : ' it ’s completely daft '
