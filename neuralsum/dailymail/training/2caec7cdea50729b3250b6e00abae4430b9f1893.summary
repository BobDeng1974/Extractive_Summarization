by @entity0 a writer claims he was almost involved in a mid-air collision two weeks ago that could have been one of the deadliest air accidents ever			1
@entity5 was flying from @entity6 to @entity7 when he says his plane almost collided with another			1
he estimates that 590 could have died if the pilot had n't veered out of the way of the on - coming jet , yet the near - miss has n't made the news			1
in an essay for medium , @entity5 argues that it 's events like his flight last month that prove the airline industry is desperately in need or more oversight			1
near miss : writer @entity5 was on board a @entity25 flight from @entity6 to @entity7 last month when it nearly collided with another plane head on			1
above , a stock photo of a @entity25 @entity29 dip : usually a flight 's tracker should be flat once reaching cruising altitude , but you can see the point at which the plane dipped 600 feet in the above graph around the 1:15pm point shortly after reaching cruising altitude on april 25 , the entire cabin of @entity25 flight 1205 went weightless as the pilot unexpectedly dipped 600 feet			1
' i felt my body float upwards and strain against my seatbelt			0
there was a loud crash in the back — a coffeepot clattering to the floor and tumbling down the aisle , ' @entity5 wrote			2
' our tray tables began rattling in unison as the 757 strained through the kind of maneuver meant more for a fighter jet			0
' after a few minutes , a flustered flight attendant came over the intercom and said : ' ok			0
' once the plane climbed back up to cruising altitude the flight attendant explained that ' the pilot took evasive action to avoid an aircraft in our flight path ' and that everyone 's in - flight entertainment would be comped for the flight			1
safely on the ground on @entity7 , @entity5 interviewed the flight and began his own research into what really happened and how air traffic is controlled			1
on a road , cars stay out of each others way by driving in different lanes , but that does n't work in the air			0
instead westbound flights fly at even altitudes while eastbound flights fly at odd altitudes			0
@entity5 's flight to @entity7 was flying at 33,000 feet , meaning they were in the right and the oncoming plane was in the wrong ' lane ' so to speak			1
protocol : when two airplane are about to collide , systems on board send out an alarm and give orders for each plane to either dive or climb moments from crashing : but by the time the @entity25 pilot received the alarm on april 25 , he could already see the plane ahead of him and had to act quicker shortly after reaching cruising altitude , an alarm went off in the cockpit , alerting the pilots that they were in the direct path of another flight			1
when this happens , the two planes are given orders to either dive or climb so as to get out of each others air space			1
but by the time the pilot received the alarm in this case , the oncoming plane was dangerously close - close enough to see coming head on			2
planes going 600mph can close a distance of 5 miles in 15 seconds meaning they were mere moments away from collision			0
' @entity131 s * * * , there it is ! ' the pilot exclaimed , and immediately took the plane into a dive			2
' the first officer later told me the @entity137 flight was “ certainly too close for comfort			0
after researching past collisions , @entity5 discovered that the april near - miss could have been the most disastrous in history			2
currently , the most deadly airplane collision is the @entity142 of 1977 , which claimed 583 lives when two 747s collided			1
@entity146 proportions : the deadliest aircraft collision happened at @entity148 in 1977 and claimed 583 lives			1
@entity5 estimates that 590 would have been killed if his plane collided over the @entity150 last month last month , @entity5 was on board a 757 - 300 , the longest narrow - body twin jet ever made , with 289 on board			1
since they were traveling over the @entity150 the other plane was most likely similarly large			0
' had there been a collision , it would have been the new record , with an estimated 590 deaths , one of them mine , ' @entity5 said			2
but the story still has n't been reported in the news because of the way airlines self - govern themselves			0
when an incident happens in the air outside of air traffic control , it 's up to the pilot to report incident			2
it wasm't until two weeks after the accident that the @entity174 finally found out about the incident and said it was being investigated , both internally by the airline and by the @entity177			0
however , an @entity174 inspector in @entity6 told @entity5 that nothing was likely to come from the investigation because everything on the planes seemed to work properly			2
@entity5 finds this ludicrous and compares it to driving a car on a road at night when suddenly you see another car coming at you in the wrong land			0
' you swerve into another lane just as the car passes			0
the @entity174 ’s view would hold that nothing was amiss because your headlights revealed the oncoming car , ' he explains			0
in the essay , @entity5 calls for more oversight of the airline companies and believes they should collect better data and be more open with sharing their findings .			0

@entity5 was on board a @entity7 bound flight from @entity6 that almost collided with another plane
shortly after reaching cruising altitude , the pilot looked ahead and saw another plane approaching head on
the pilot dived and missed the plane , though its still *uncertain* why they entered each other 's air space and with so little *warning*
the deadliest aircraft collision happened in 1977 and claimed 583 lives
@entity5 estimates that 590 could have died if his plane crashed
