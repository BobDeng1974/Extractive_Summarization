nestled beneath a stretch of earth in a quiet @entity4 village , archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of hand - carved figurines			1
no less than 29 of these so - called guldgubbars , which means ' @entity8 ' , were unearthed in the southern region of @entity10 and each are thought to have been made using 6th century roman coins			1
the figurines are most commonly found at sites of ritual and worship as devotions to the gods , and because they were discovered alongside the ruins of houses and a forge , archaeologists now believe the area may have been home to an @entity26 cult			1
no less than 29 so - called guldgubbars , pictured , were unearthed in the southern region of @entity10 in @entity4			1
each of the figurines are around two centimetres tall and were made using 6th century roman coins hammered into the elaborate shapes ‘ without a doubt , the place was important during the @entity26 for several hundred years , ’ said lead archaeologist @entity33			1
‘ clearly , we can start a new chapter in the study of the @entity39			0
’ the hoard of gold , said to be one of the largest discoveries of guldgubbar in the whole of @entity4 , was found during excavations of the site being carried out by the @entity48			1
each of the figurines is thought to date back to the 6th century ad and each measure two centimetres tall			2
guldgubbars are also known as @entity8 or @entity53 because they are shaped like men , pictured left , and women , right			1
they 're commonly associated with places or political or religious significance and are thought to have been created as gifts for the gods in certain cults the figurines were found at a site in the west of @entity65 , a village in @entity10 , pictured , on the south coast of @entity4			1
researchers have suspected the area was an @entity26 settlement for some time since finding a 3rd century bronze bust in the same region back in 2004 , and more recently , unearthing the ruins of houses ‘ the discovery of gold from this period shows that people in the area served as soldiers in the @entity81 , ' said @entity82 , of @entity83			1
‘ up here in the @entity85 the gold coins that had been paid to the soldiers were melted down and formed into guldgubbar and guldkoner			2
' @entity89 refers to the female figurines , also known as @entity53			1
the theory about the site being an @entity26 settlement were bolstered by the discovery of glass beads and other bronze household items as well as pottery , animal bones and clay			0
‘ @entity8 men are most commonly found at sites associated with power or religious rites , ’ continued @entity33			1
‘ maybe the site has been used as a place of worship but as yet we can only speculate			0
‘ what we now know about the place is that it was a certainly a settlement in the @entity26			0
’ the discovery of the gold figurines , alongside bronze busts and signs that a community once lived in the region , has led archaeologists to believe an @entity26 cult once lived in the area			1
@entity52 , also known as @entity8 or @entity53 , are commonly associated with places or political or religious significance			1
they were made from coins , in this instance given to local residents who were soldiers of the @entity81 , and hammered into the shapes of clothed men and women			2
hoards of objects such as these , as well as the bronze objects found in the same region , may have been buried as gifts to the gods			0
metal during the @entity136 and @entity26 was deemed valuable enough for objects made from it to serve as a sacrifice			2
the vast number of guldgubbars discovered in @entity65 , said to be the third largest hoard ever found in @entity4 , additionally suggests this area could have been a region of great religious significance			1
this is bolstered by the various ruins of houses and other findings hinting that a settlement would have been set up in the region and survived for hundreds of years			0
archaeologists have known for some time the region once held @entity154 significance			0
although @entity4 was not part of the @entity157 , experts have speculated that inhabitants of the region may have been mercenaries for the @entity81			0
@entity161 warriors have also been found containing roman weapons , which reinforces the interaction between the two cultures			0
in 2004 , researchers uncovered a cast bronze head in the region and believe it represents a @entity170 god or goddess			0
in 2004 , researchers from @entity173 uncovered a cast bronze head , pictured , in the same region as the figurines and believe it to represent a @entity170 god or goddess more recently , researchers also uncovered five more bronze cast heads			2
the majority are thought to be of @entity170 origin like the one found in 2004 yet two , pictured , were designed differently			0
both have @entity154 features with so - called ‘ melon hairstyles ’ and date back to @entity185 interestingly , during the latest round of excavations , researchers uncovered five more of these heads			2

it is not known whether the collections of @entity170 and @entity154 figures are linked , although it is unusual that devotional artefacts from two different cultures have been found so close to one another			0
it is thought the @entity154 heads would have been fixed to bronze jugs or drinking vessels			0
two of the bronze heads discovered in @entity65 on display at the @entity48 archaeologists believe the heads , including the one pictured , would have been fixed to bronze jugs or drinking vessels			2
they are also similar to @entity26 heads recently found on the island of @entity212			2
