by @entity0 published : 22:30 est , 2 may 2013 updated : 05:13 est , 3 may 2013 it 's a computer strapped to a user 's face at all times while called revolutionary and technologically savvy by its creators			2
but in the rest of the world , @entity7 is being compared to the pocket protector , the @entity11 and even the @entity13 - in other words the epitomes of dorkiness			1
as seen in a @entity20 image gallery titled , @entity17 , early critics – presumably most who have n’t tried the device yet sold in stores - laugh and poke fun at those photographed wearing the spectacles that straps a camera to its user ’s head			1
nerds ! in a @entity20 gallery titled , @entity17 , photos are uploaded showing current users of the device to wide poking and name calling , one such photo pictured comparison : some compare the pricy spectacles to pocket protectors , seen worn by the characters in ' @entity41 ' here a writer at @entity43 implores someone to start a contrasting gallery titled : people who look cool while wearing @entity7			1
that has yet to happen			2
the designers behind the headpiece which enables its users to take hands - free pictures , send email , and talk on the phone among various other uses , acknowledges mass resistance to the spectacles			2
but they insist most just need time			2
' our goal is to make the world better , ' @entity60 chairman @entity59 said of the device at @entity65 last week			1
' we ’ll take the criticism along the way , but criticisms are inevitably from people who are afraid of change or who have not figured out that there will be an adaptation of society to it , ' he said			2
@entity76 golfer and two - time @entity78 winner , @entity79 , right , try on @entity7 at the @entity80 at the @entity81 in april mirror : memes expressing how @entity7 users may actually look while wearing the device aim to draw laughs still public critics are already calling @entity7 wearers ‘ a * * holes , ’ dorks and even douchebags			1
it 's not a far off cry from some of the first critics of the @entity11 , a similar hands - free device which allows its users to take personal calls			1
' you mean the doucheset ? ' a @entity100 user commented on a 2008 message board titled : ' pssst ...			2
. you look like a dork with your @entity11 headset on ... ' ' i just had a guy walk into my store with his blue tooth and i could not take him seriously ! ' another wrote			1
' " douchebag " is the perfect description ! ! ' some reasoning for the hatred toward this particular earpiece are accusations its users appear to think of themselves as being far more important than they really are			2
predecessors : this outrageous photo , tagged @entity7 team 1995 , has also circulated on twitter what 's cool ? a businessman wears a @entity11 headset in his car , left , while right a man is seen commuting to work on a @entity13 ‘ if you are power walking on the treadmill and are on your @entity130 conversating , congratulations , you are a douchebag ! ’ another wrote			1
image aside , critics are attacking @entity7 for its astounding abilities as well			1
some accuse its camera as being a potential destruction to public privacy , with some stores and private establishments having already banned customers from wearing them inside			0
when @entity7 users give an audible command of ' ok , @entity7 , take a picture , ' the software kicks in doing as it 's told			1
while that ability is already widely upsetting to some who fear they could be undesirably photographed in public , there 's now an app that allows users to perform this function silently as well			0
called @entity154 , this new app allows its users to silently order photographs taken with a mere wink of the eye			0
the @entity159 @entity158 : a drawing of a fictional @entity159 monocle shows a possible competitor to @entity7 while said to be substantially less stupid looking ' i 've taken more pictures today than i have the past 5 days thanks to this , ' @entity154 's developer @entity163 from @entity164 said on his @entity170 page			1
' sure , they are mostly silly , but my timeline has now truly become a timeline of where i 've been			0
' further stretching concerns on privacy is new talk this week of @entity178 's own privacy being violated			0
one software developer this week warned of hackers ' ability to remotely control the device , in effect seeing and hearing everything the wearer does			0
- @entity60 chairman @entity59 ‘ they have control over a camera and a microphone that are attached to your head , ’ software developer @entity186 who was selected to test out @entity7 said in a blog post this week			1
‘ a bugged @entity7 does n't just watch your every move : it watches everything you are looking at ... and hears everything you do			1
the only thing it does n't know are your thoughts , ’ he writes			0
then there 's caution thrown at the device 's lavish cost - currently expected to be $ 1,500 once released - as a danger of easily being stolen			0
last year ordinary smartphone thefts accounted for 42 percent of robberies in @entity210 , @entity210 , nearly half of all robberies in @entity213 and 14 percent of all crimes committed in @entity216 - figures drastically raised over the years as the @entity217 reports			0
' we ’re acutely aware of those questions , ' @entity59 responded to similar concerns raised at @entity65 over the device 's abilities being so new			0
' we want to be very careful that this new invention is not misused ... but i ’m always concerned about premature regulation based on fear , as opposed to understanding what ’s possible			0
' the people who ’ve used @entity7 , including myself , report it as remarkable			1
i ’d like to let it get a little bit farther off a runway before we characterize it in the obvious ways , ' @entity59 said			0
with a quiet wink of an eye @entity7 users will now be able to take a picture thanks to one of many new apps released and currently in development for the device			1
snap ! a new app for @entity7 called @entity243 allows users to take pictures with the blink of an eye ordinarily @entity7 users must deliver an audible command of , ' ok , @entity7 , take a picture , ' to kick in the camera 's software			1
however with its release this week program @entity154 will additionally give users the option of silently ordering the command			0
' you might not think it 's hard to say " ok , @entity261 " or even just tap a button			0
but it 's a context switch that takes you out of the moment , even if just for a second , ' @entity154 's developer @entity163 from @entity164 explained on his @entity170 page on wednesday			0
' i 've taken more pictures today than i have the past 5 days thanks to this , ' he continued			0
' sure , they are mostly silly , but my timeline has now truly become a timeline of where i 've been			0
' however while pirating images of subjects in public may be one use for the device , speaking like one will not be allowed , as @entity280 has revealed			0
@entity60 's voice translation technology censors curse words , prohibiting its user from for instance sending a voice - written email containing an explicative			1
currently there is said to be no way to disable to filter , which would work similar to @entity60 's @entity290 option , the website reports .			2

critics poke fun at @entity7 comparing it to the pocket protector , @entity11 and @entity13
