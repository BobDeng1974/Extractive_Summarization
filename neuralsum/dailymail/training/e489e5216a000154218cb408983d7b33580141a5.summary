by @entity0 published : 16:31 est , 1 august 2013 updated : 02:11 est , 2 august 2013 @entity1 : the celebrity chef is definitely not in the pink after being told to repaint his 15th century hotel when @entity5 chose to repaint his 15th century hotel a shade of pink , he perhaps thought it would add to the colourful palette used on old buildings in @entity13 villages			1
but the chef is being forced to repaint his historic hotel after locals complained that the @entity18 listed building looked like ' blancmange ' as he has not used the traditional @entity20			1
villagers had asked planning officials to investigate after the outside walls of the @entity24 , which dominates the market place in the medieval village of @entity27 , were changed from cream to pink			1
one of the upset local residents said : ' it looks as if someone has got their history badly wrong - @entity13 pink is a traditional colour here and has been for centuries			2
but it is not that chocolate - box pink that people think it is			0
' @entity41 dates back to the 14th century or earlier			0
then paints were coloured using whatever was to hand , and ox - blood was used to produce the colour properly recognised as @entity20			0
' there is a rich pageant of old colours in this village - from red to yellow and rust to mustard - and frankly the @entity24 looked ridiculous pink			2
' it has changed colour over the years but no - one here can remember it being such a twee colour			0
' another resident who lives just yards from the @entity24 said : ' it is a ghastly inappropriate colour and totally out of place in the middle of so many other buildings painted in proper sympathetic heritage colours			2
' the job was done in a couple of days using cheap trade paint that was just slapped on - it 's not even lime - wash which is what should be used on property in @entity27			0
' parish council chairman @entity70 , who once ran the @entity24 which mr @entity5 took over two years ago , said : ' villagers were generally appalled by the new colour - no - one liked it			1
' @entity74 : residents have fiercely criticised the celebrity chef 's choice of colour , which they say looks like the famous dessert mr @entity5 upset villagers within days of taking over the hotel and pub when he refused to serve lager or @entity84 , claiming it encouraged the wrong sort of people to the establishment , which was built as a tavern in around 1420			1
' people here are already fairly cheesed off with mr @entity5 because of the changes he made at the @entity24 and they would be very upset if he was allowed to get away with things , ' said mr @entity70			1
the controversial cook also made the headlines earlier this year when a judge branded him a ' wealthy idiot '			2
last night the hotel confirmed that the hotel would be repainted			0
manager @entity100 said : ' the building needed freshening up and @entity5 chose the colour but we have agreed to change it and instead have a much darker pink			1
' we did n't need permission to change the colour but we are happy to change it and use one recommended by @entity109			0
' that 's more like it : this @entity18 cottage in the coastal village of @entity114 has been decorated with proper @entity116 paint			0

outraged residents have rounded on the celebrity chef over choice of paint
@entity5 has agreed to repaint his hotel after it was branded a ' blancmange '
the famously *grouchy* cook has already upset villagers after *banning* lager
@entity24 says it will agree new shade of pink with @entity109
