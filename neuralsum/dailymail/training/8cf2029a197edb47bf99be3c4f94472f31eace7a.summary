by @entity0 published : 09:44 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 10:36 est , 5 october 2012 it is a dress @entity2 could have worn 60 years earlier , from its pastel tone to the @entity5 sensibility			2
but far from reaching into the past , @entity7 's dusty green shift is from @entity9 's yet - to - be released contemporary label , miss @entity10 , which does n’t hit stores until january 2013			1
the @entity12 was photographed in the brand new collection 's ' modern weave dress ' at a campaign event in @entity16 , @entity17 - which she paired with a cropped cardigan and a statement necklace			2
mrs @entity7 has long been a vocal supporter of @entity9 , and now , three years after putting his name on the mainstream fashion map , famously appearing his design at the @entity23 in 2009 , the @entity12 is the first person to wear a piece from his new collection			0
first lady first : @entity7 's dusty green shift is from @entity9 's yet - to - be released contemporary label , miss @entity10 , which does n't hit stores until january 2013 instrumental in catapulting the then up - and - coming designer into the hungry eyes of @entity32 mass retail , mrs @entity7 has worn his designs on many occasions , including on the cover of @entity36			1
while the @entity12 usually wears pieces on the back - end of a collection 's shelf life , she has firmly established herself as someone who supports young talent , and according to @entity45 , the @entity44 @entity10 dress was sent to her by the designer			1
the new contemporary collection , which is ' a little bit more playful and a little younger , ' will retail for less than the @entity9 line , and launches in partnership with @entity51 in january			1
the 29 - year - old designer told @entity54 : ' instead of just doing " @entity9 - for-less , " the idea is to explore the other side of myself			0
' i always see @entity9 [ the collection ] as my aesthetic , my design sensibility			0
miss @entity10 is my personality			1
it was really fun to explore that facet of who i am - slightly more downtown , and with a more relaxed attitude			0
' the collection retails from ' an approachable ' $ 195 for a sleeveless silk bow blouse to $ 795 for a black leather jacket			1
whereas a garment from the @entity9 collection averages about $ 1,700			2
miss @entity10 : the @entity12 was photographed in the brand new collection 's ' modern weave dress ' at a campaign event in @entity16 , @entity17 - which she paired with a cropped cardigan and a statement necklace @entity77 , @entity51 ’s executive vice president of designer merchandising , explained : ' there ’s a large audience who wants to wear his clothes			1
' this collaboration has an appeal not just to a younger set of women , but to a broader set of women and at prices that are approachable			2
' what ’s great is that while feeling different from the @entity9 signature collection , it still clearly has @entity9 ’s design dna			0
' mr @entity9 added : ' one thing that is rare in the contemporary market is more feminine , girlier clothes			0
it tends to be more hard - edged , or too young			0
i felt this is something that brings a little bit of softness			0
' the first collection of miss @entity10 , inspired by the @entity5 , will be available at @entity51 , as well as at @entity102 for one year , starting january 7th .			1

miss @entity10 launches on january 7th at @entity51 , with prices starting at $ 195
