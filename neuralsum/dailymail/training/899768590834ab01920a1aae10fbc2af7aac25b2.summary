@entity0 returns to @entity1 for the first time on sunday , complaining the club he served for 12 years never let him say goodbye before his move to @entity6			1
@entity0 made 455 appearances and a huge contribution to @entity1 ’s success under sir @entity10			1
but executive vice-chairman @entity11 stunned the defender by choosing to tell him immediately after the last game of last season , in the away dressing room at @entity16 , that he was not going to be offered a new contract			1
as a result , the 35 - year - old former @entity19 captain left for @entity21 in july			1
‘ i had great years at @entity23 , ’ @entity0 told the @entity22			1
‘ i never got to say goodbye when i left , which was unfortunate , so it will be a nice opportunity to say bye to a lot of people who supported me and helped me			2
asked if @entity0 would still be a valuable asset , @entity1 ’s manager replied : ‘ no. there is a time to stay and time to go and i think he decided to go			1
he was a great player and maybe he is still a great player , but there is always a time to go for a player in a club			2
’ this weekend the first extracts of @entity0 ’s autobiography will appear in a newspaper serialisation , with the centre half expected to give forthright views on @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58			1
@entity56 was suspended for four matches and fined £ 220,000 in september 2012 for racially abusing @entity0 ’s brother , @entity60 , during a game between @entity62 and @entity6 the previous year			1
@entity56 apologised for the ‘ language used in the game ’ but to this day he has not apologised to @entity60			0
@entity65 is also expected to deliver his verdict on @entity57 ’s difficult 10 - month spell as @entity1 manager last season and to talk about @entity58 , who chose @entity56 ahead of him for @entity70			1
@entity42 has endured a turbulent start to his tenure at @entity1 as they chase a first win new signings @entity75 ( left ) and @entity76 were unveiled at @entity23 on friday the decision to move to @entity6 , said @entity0 , was motivated by the chance to finish with @entity37 , the manager who launched his career			1
‘ @entity80 and @entity37 were the two main factors , ’ he said			0
‘ he gave me an opportunity to start at @entity83 and this is going to be the final chapter in my career , and to finish it with him was a huge pull			0
’ @entity0 and @entity37 may have to contend with a @entity1 side featuring five players making their home debuts following their £ 150m spending spree			1
and @entity93 believes it will be easier deciding how to fit in all his new signings than managing the expectations of supporters			0
@entity98 joined @entity1 from @entity99 for £ 60m over the summer in that same @entity22 interview , @entity0 was asked for his view on the changes that have taken place since @entity93 arrived			1
‘ pre-season was really exciting for @entity1 , ’ he said			2
‘ they looked really fit , really decisive and they looked like they had a good understanding of the system			0
‘ and it was almost like a complete reversal once the season started			2
i think they will get it right			0
i ’ve got every confidence the manager will bring back the good times for @entity1			2
it ’s just a matter of how long			0
’ but @entity0 was critical of what many perceive as @entity1 abandoning their long - held policy of nurturing their own talent , a shift epitomised by the sale of @entity121 to @entity122 for £ 16million to make room for @entity75 on wages reportedly approaching £ 300,000 a week			1
‘ the traditional @entity1 fans , the real followers of the club , took great pride and pleasure in the club producing home - grown players , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it seems there might be a change in the order			0
’ striker @entity121 , a @entity1 youth graduate , was sold to @entity122 on transfer deadline day for £ 16m @entity0 celebrates after @entity1 beat @entity62 to win the @entity137 in 2008 he said : ‘ for a coach it is always easy because he decides what he sees			1
i observe and then decide			0
i do n’t have any worries about that			0
what the fans are expecting and what i expect are different			0
the fans will expect a new start , of course , and with these kind of players a victory			0
‘ but i know as a coach that when you let go 14 players and buy six new ones , you have 20 different relationships in the dressing - room			2
now we have to build up a new one and that always needs time			0
’ the vast sums spent this summer by @entity1 and other leading clubs have led @entity37 to call for a @entity40 transfer spending cap			2
‘ to make it fair play we should be able to spend as much as @entity1 spent before we play them on sunday , ’ he said			1
‘ what is fair play ? one team can spend £ 200m on their team and another eight or ten million			0
that ’s not fair play			0
how is it a fair play league when we spend £ 26 - £ 28m ? fair play would be everybody having a maximum of £ 30m or whatever to spend and having to bring some players out of the youth team			2
’ the full interview will be shown on @entity180 , saturday 12.10pm on @entity181 .			0
