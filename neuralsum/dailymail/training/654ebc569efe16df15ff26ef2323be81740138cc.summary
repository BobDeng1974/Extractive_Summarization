by @entity0 the original pencil drawings for the prototypes of the temporary mobile ports - the @entity4 harbours - which played a crucial role in the d - day landings in 1944 are to be sold at auction			1
the secret wartime plans , designed and drawn by the @entity10 engineer @entity9 in 1942 , are being offered by an anonymous @entity12 collector and are expected to raise between £ 40,000 and £ 60,000 at the @entity14 sale at @entity15 in @entity16 on june 5			1
the makeshift harbour was one of the greatest military achievements of all time and its development was even described by @entity24 - @entity23 's architect and armaments minister - as ' genius '			1
the original plans for the @entity4 harbour invention that allowed the @entity30 invasion of @entity31 on @entity32 are expected to fetch £ 60,000 at auction			1
they were designed by @entity10 engineer @entity9 @entity9 came up with the earliest prototypes			2
his plans were drawn up during an intensive seven - week period , from june 17 to august 6 , 1942 - two years before d - day the makeshift harbours in action during the @entity32 in june 1944			1
they enabled the @entity41 to land troops , vehicles and equipment on @entity31 soil without having to capture a port first the @entity47 were a response to the need of the @entity41 to find a port large enough to accommodate the huge amount of supplies required to support an invasion of mainland @entity54			0
a @entity15 spokesman said : ' aware that capturing an existing port in @entity31 was next to impossible , @entity9 first proposed the idea of floating harbours to the @entity59 during 1941			1
' his brother , a @entity61 commander , brought the idea to the attention of senior staff and by that route to @entity66			1
' the prime minister was favourably inclined to the idea having proposed something similar as a member of the war cabinet during the @entity72			1
' in may 1942 - fully two years before the @entity73 issued a directive to admiral mountbatten : ' @entity76 on beaches			1
they must float up and down with the tide			0
' the anchor problem must be mastered			0
let me have the best solution worked out			0
do n’t argue the matter			0
the difficulties will argue for themselves			0
' a @entity15 spokesman said : ' these documents contain the origins of the simple but devastatingly effective idea which transformed the @entity30 invasion of @entity54 in 1944			1
it took over two years to turn the concept first into plans and then into prototypes which , under conditions of great secrecy , could be rigorously tested ' @entity9 devised two types of device , codenamed ' @entity98 ' ( concrete caissons that could be anchored in as pierheads ) and ' @entity101 ' ( steel roadways linking them together ) the spokesman added : ' the @entity4 harbours made possible the initial landings at @entity105 and the continued supply of troops during the @entity30 invasion that turned the tide of the war			1
the enemy ’s perspective on their value is especially revealing			0
' at the @entity116 , @entity24 , former @entity115 minister of armaments , was forced to admit that the @entity121 ’ costly , two - year effort to construct @entity123 defences had been " brought to nothing because of an idea of simple genius "			1
' @entity9 was chosen to head the project and the plans going on sale , drawn up between june and august 1942 , are the basis of what eventually became the @entity4 harbours deployed in may 1944 in time for the june invasion of @entity31			1
the documents are @entity9 ’ own retained 1:44 scale copies , described by him as ‘ proposed landing jetties ’			2
@entity24 ( right , pictured here with @entity23 ) was forced to admit that the @entity121 ¿ costly , two - year effort to construct @entity123 defences had been " brought to nothing because of an idea of simple genius " ' remains of @entity139 at @entity140 ( @entity142 beach ) in @entity105 , used by the @entity143 and @entity144 during @entity14 the plans drawn up over seven weeks and were finished by august 6th , 1942			1
the project test near @entity9 ’ home town of @entity148 in @entity149 was so secret almost a thousand men working on it were unaware of its true purpose			0
the finished prototypes were subsequently towed to another secret test site in south - west @entity156			2
there , @entity9 ’ efforts were integrated with prototypes developed by two other teams			0
the work at @entity164 , @entity165 in @entity156 included development and testing of breakwaters , the idea for which came from engineer @entity169			2
he had noticed while having a bath that when he made waves on one side of the flannel , on the other side the waters were calm			0
the @entity4 harbours were completed by may 1944 and successfully launched with the use of tug boats soon after			2
their purpose was to ease and speed up the unloading process so that @entity30 troops were supplied as they advanced across @entity31			0
they were , as @entity66 later wrote , ' to form a principal part of the great plan '			2
each of the two artificial harbours was made up of about six miles of flexible steel roadways that floated on steel or concrete pontoons			2
the roadways were codenamed ' @entity192 ' and the pontoons ' beetles '			0
the ‘ whales ’ ended at giant pier heads that had legs that rested on the seabed			0
the whole structure was protected from the force of the sea by scuttled ships , sunken caissons ( a type of pump used in marine engineering ) and a line of floating breakwaters			2
they were comprised of a staggering amount of material - 144,000 tonnes of concrete , 85,000 tonnes of ballast and 105,000 tonnes of steel			0
during d - day operations , @entity4 was installed at @entity215 , for @entity12 invasion forces , while @entity217 was set up at @entity140 ( @entity218 ) for the @entity143 and @entity219 two weeks after d - day , a massive storm destroyed @entity222 also sustained some damage , but was reinforced to keep it operable at least until the end of october			1
@entity217 was left open until november 19 and @entity9 was involved throughout , making adjustments and reinforcements			0
in that time this harbour landed 2.5million men , 500,000 vehicles and four million tonnes of goods .			0

*mulberry* harbours were floating ports that allowed mass troop landings in the *aftermath* of d - day
@entity66 himself *authorised* the *scheme* in 1942 after having similar idea during first world war
even *top* @entity115 @entity24 acknowledged they were ' simple genius '
the documents were owned by the engineer behind the feat and could fetch £ 60,000
