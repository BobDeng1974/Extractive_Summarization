by @entity0 last updated at 7:14 pm on 12th october 2011 a @entity3 doctor who put a porn addict through ' total hell ' by prescribing him an unlicensed hallucinogenic drug failed to fully explain the risks of the experimental treatment to him , a tribunal ruled			1
dr @entity9 gave the drug , @entity11 , to the 25 - year - old man who was obsessed with internet pornography			1
the patient paid more than £ 1,900 for the treatment , which was administered in @entity9 's bedroom at his home in north @entity18			1
dr @entity9 ( above ) gave @entity11 , an unlicensed hallucinogenic drug ( right ) , to a 25 - year - old porn addict the @entity22 - trained doctor claimed effects would be like ' floating on a river ' and that he would spend 36 hours in a ' waking but dreamlike state ' , the @entity25 heard			1
but the celibate addict , known as patient a , said it was a ' horrendous treatment ' , and within minutes of taking the drug he felt ' everything had changed '			1
he went on to experience months of mental health problems , including insomnia , paranoia and psychosis			1
@entity9 now faces being banned from the profession after being found guilty of failing to properly explain the risks of the drug and gain his patient 's informed consent			1
his website ' failed to set out a single risk ' associated with the drug , which is banned in a number of countries , said panel chairman dr @entity48			1
' the panel considered there to be an obligation upon you , as a registered medical practitioner , to set out a balanced view of the risks and benefits associated with the use of @entity11 , ' he said			1
' this is particularly important because the drug is unlicensed			2
' @entity9 ran a website offering the controversial medicine and promised it could cure drug and alcohol addiction , the hearing has been told			2
patient a first visited dr @entity9 at his @entity68 in february 2009 and paid £ 100 per counselling session and £ 1,900 for the @entity11 but the medicine , which is derived from the root of an @entity72 plant , has been banned in a number of countries ( see box below ) after being linked to patient deaths and has a worrying catalogue of side effects			1
patient a first visited dr @entity9 at his @entity68 in february 2009 for a porn addiction , and paid £ 100 per counselling session and £ 1,900 for the @entity11			1
the addict would watch hours and hours of internet pornography every night and could not stop himself from doing so despite knowing it was unhealthy and that he was ' hooked '			2
he was not told of risks including insomnia , vomiting , cardiac arrest and serious allergic reactions before being given the drug in @entity9 's home			1
the medic only gave him a consent form listing previously unmentioned side effects just before administering the drug on august 1 , 2009			2
@entity79 said : ' i was hallucinating , seeing things inside the eye of my mind and then i did n't know where i was and did n't know what time it was			2
' it was horrible , i was panicking			2
' my chest was all over the place , i could n't control it			2
after a while , it felt like my heart was slowing down			2
it was total hell really			2
' giving evidence , @entity9 claimed the treatment is ' actually very safe ' , and could provide patients with a ' deeper experience ' and a ' window of freedom from that addiction '			1
@entity11 ( seen above in powdered form ) is an extract of the @entity72 shrub @entity122 , a relative of the coffee plant			1
in @entity126 , it is a well - known hallucinogen used in male rites of passage			1
the drug is also used as a tool by hunters to increase awareness and allows them to remain very still for long periods			0
its current legal status in the @entity136 , and much of the rest of the world , is that of an unlicensed , experimental medication , and it is not therefore an offence to possess it , though to act as a distributor may be breaking the law			0
@entity11 is a restricted substance ( possession is illegal ) in some countries , including the @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
the medic said he had been prescribing the drug for about a year and insisted that ' practically all ' of 19 deaths associated with it had been caused by other medical ailments			0
he said : ' it has been used for centuries by traditional people who tend to avoid poisonous things that are harmful			0
' also , it has been used by @entity163 and @entity164 workers in @entity126 , and it has been prescribed in @entity165 since the early part of the last century as a neuromuscular stimulant			0
' there is n't a licensed alternative for this			0
' @entity9 was found to have failed to state that @entity11 was an unlicensed drug and to set out possible risks in a website advertising treatment with the drug			1
the medic admitted that he did not discuss alternative treatments that were licensed in the @entity136 , and did not inform the patient 's gp about the treatment			0
he further failed to explain the risks adequately to @entity79 before handing him a consent form to sign on august 1 , just before treatment began			0
it meant @entity9 did not ensure that the addict understood the risks involved in the treatment prior to prescribing the drug , and did not obtain his informed consent , the panel ruled			0
' the panel notes that the risks set out on the consent form are almost exclusively physical in nature , ' said dr @entity48			0
' the panel noted from the documentation provided that there may be psychological risks associated with treatment with @entity11			1
' @entity79 denied being made aware of some of these risks , both physical and psychological			0
' the panel found that you had failed to ensure that patient a understood these risks			0
@entity9 also inappropriately treated patient a at his home address on 1 august 2009 , as it did not have facilities for a ' medical or psychiatric emergency which could have arisen ' the panel ruled			0
the medic was cleared of ' acting inappropriately ' by ' laughing at and belittling ' the patient and dismissing his concerns he might lose his job , as the panel said there was not enough evidence to support the charges			0
he was also cleared of refusing to allow his mother to attend a session , which the panel accepted would not be good practice			0
but @entity9 was found to have inappropriately refused to meet with @entity79 's parents , who were waiting outside his house , after a consultation on october 12 , 2009			0
' by october 12 , 2009 , there had been a clear deterioration in @entity79 's mental health of which you were aware , ' said dr @entity48			0
' the parents had serious concerns regarding their son 's wellbeing to which you should have listened			0
' t he panel must now decide if the doctor is fit to continue practising unrestricted			0

@entity22 - trained physician had claimed he would float in a ' dreamlike state ' after taking @entity11
man , 25 , suffered paranoia , psychosis and insomnia
