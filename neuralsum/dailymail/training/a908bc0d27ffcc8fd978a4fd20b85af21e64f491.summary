@entity0 has been fighting his whole life			1
growing up on a travellers site , his boxing education started not in the gym but in bare - knuckle scraps from the age of just five			2
@entity0 , now 25 but still living on a site in @entity8 with his wife and two young sons , is the great - grandson of @entity11 , considered the @entity14 culture 's finest fighter			1
@entity0 , who grew up on a travellers site , will fight @entity16 in @entity17 on saturday night @entity14 boxer @entity0 poses outside his home near @entity19 , just north of @entity17 and on saturday , he hopes to take another step on the road to becoming the first traveller to win a world title when he faces @entity16			1
' imagine a site of 48 plots all with little kids growing up together , ' he says			2
' you 're going out there and every single day , all it is is fighting , then playing			1
' you have a game of football then you have a fight over it , then you play again			1
imagine that all your life			2
growing up like that does nothing but harden you inside			2
' if i had a fight when i was young my mum and dad would n't know about it			1
if he [ @entity44 ] had a fight , he 'd go straight back and tell his mum			1
it was a natural thing for me , i 've been brought up on it and it hardens you inside			2
' it is 100 per cent a different experience to being a professional fighter but it hardens you and i 've never ever given in in my life			2
i 'm not that sort of person and if i was i would n't be in this sport			2
' when you 're born into it , it becomes natural			2
it stops when you 're 15 and you 're getting a bit older and you 're going to work and stuff , that 's when the younger kids start			2
it 's a culture and it always happens			2
the 25 - year - old ( right ) has won all 20 of his professional fights , and is more experienced than his opponent @entity0 ( right ) is the current @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 middleweight champion ' when you walk out there , some people think it would feel like , " i 'm not going out there because i do n't want to have a fight "			1
' but it 's not like that with us – you have to fight			1
whether you win or lose you 're getting out there and having a fight , it 's as simple as that			1
' @entity0 has vowed to retire if he loses to @entity44 in a fight for the former 's @entity72 , @entity74 and @entity73 middleweight titles			1
it also carries the prize of a shot at the @entity96 world title against the winner of @entity99 's clash with @entity100 in @entity101 next month			0
and much has been made of @entity44 's size advantage amid stories that he has given the likes of @entity105 a torrid time in sparring			0
but it is again to his upbringing that @entity0 turns in response			1
' i 'll tell you a story about @entity113 , a big fella who is now a good friend of mine , but we became friends after we had a fight , ' he says			1
' it was something stupid , i was 16 or 17 and he was from around my end			0
we had an argument , he 's a heavyweight , a big boy , 6 foot 6 and 18 at the time			0
and this was one time where if i could have talked myself out of it i would have			0
' we were on the site and we just had it			0
there was an argument and it escalated into a little challenge to me and there were too many people there to turn it down			0
i would have loved to get out of it , i was thinking , " i do n't need this " but i said , " if you want to fight let 's have it "			1
the two fighters square up at the weigh - in at the @entity141 in @entity17 @entity16 has considerably less professional and amateur experience than his opponent ' we had our shirts off and we had a fight for 10 minutes			1
but what a good fight and i beat him			1
it was in a field , bare - knuckle and we shook hands afterwards and became friends , very good friends			0
' but it 's very hard , everything goes out the window and you stand there having it			0
it 's pointless trying to box around and conserve energy because any minute you could get hit with a big punch and go out			0
you might as well get done what you can while you can			0
' when you see a street fight , nobody has respect for each other and you see knives and bats out			1
but when you have respect for each other then it 's a fair fight , you stand up and that 's it			1
if you win or lose it 's over and there 's no dishonour in saying " enough "			0
' we 're friends now but that 's just an example of how it happens			0
it escalated out of nothing but it 's more about pride than anything else			0
' i 've never been a bully and at that stage that sort of fight was rare because you do n't get many people who want to have a fight with a boxer who is doing well in the boxing game			2
but it happened and thank @entity200 , i have n't had one since			0
' @entity0 , who represented his country at the @entity203 , has won all 20 of his professional fights but admits it is only now that he has given the sport his full attention			1
he adds : ' when i was in training for other fights the boys would say , “ are you coming with us ? we 're going to the dog track ”			0
@entity213 during his media work - out ahead of his clash with @entity16 @entity16 and @entity0 looks set to overshadow the main event between @entity217 and @entity218 ' then you go to the dog track , from there you would go to the casino then you look at your watch and it 's four in the morning			1
' i look back at that and i do n't know how i beat some of the fighters i 've beaten doing that sort of thing			0
i do n't care how good you are , a fit man will always beat a good man who is unfit			0
' in my professional boxing career i 've had 20 fights and i 've won those 20 fights on worth ethic alone because i have n't done my diet right , have n't lived the life and i know now i ca n't win a world title living the lifestyle i was living before			0
' kebabs , food , this , that , walking around at 15 stone			0
this time last year i was 16 stone – it was just a joke			0
i know i ca n't live that lifestyle – the elite fighters do n't do it			0
' when i won the @entity73 title in my last fight , the night before the weigh - in i got six - and - a - half pounds off in a sauna and i thought , " i never want to do that again "			1
' some people have to learn from a loss but luckily enough i did n't have to and i got the win but i knew i had to learn from it			0
' @entity0 vs @entity44 is live on @entity261 on satruday night			1

@entity0 and @entity263 will fight on saturday night
@entity217 and @entity218 will also be fighting at @entity265
@entity0 claimed fighting in *childhood* has hardened him
@entity0 is the current @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 middleweight champion
