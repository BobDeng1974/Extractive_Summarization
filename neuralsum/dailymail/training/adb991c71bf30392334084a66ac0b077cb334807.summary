she returned at 12.30pm to rouse her - only to discover her teenage child had died			2
professor @entity45 , a consultant neuropathologist , said : ' ( @entity1 ) would n’t have known anything about it			1
' precious daughter ' : the teenager , pictured with her parents @entity42 and @entity51 , had suffered from a blood clot on the brain in 2009 which was believed to have been successfully treated ' she had taken a drink of coffee to her bedroom			1
she had texted her cousin and her boyfriend			2
her mother found her lying on her front with her body covered by the duvet			1
' professor @entity45 said the post-mortem examination showed no abnormalities on miss @entity1 's brain or heart which could have contributed to her death , but concluded her death was most likely to have been caused by a seizure			1
' we are all allowed one seizure , ' he said			1
' that does n’t make us epileptic			2
you have to look at the probabilities			0
' in this case , i would suggest that evidence points to some sort of seizure after what happened in the past			1
that affected the blood vessels and allowed fluid to flow into the lungs			2
' devastating : miss @entity1 , who missed two months of school after the clot was discovered , died just weeks before she had been due to jet off to the @entity34 to fulfil her dream of swimming with dolphins dr @entity91 , miss @entity93 ’s gp from birth , told the inquest she had seen @entity96 on a number of occasions , but nothing had emerged to make her believe @entity1 was seriously unwell			1
' there was no history of @entity1 having seizures but she did have a significant clot on the brain in 2009 , ' she said			1
' it led to her having severe headaches			0
she was entered for a scan and that revealed the clot			2
at her next mri scan , the clot had gone			2
drugs were given which allowed the clot to resolve			2
' father : @entity112 arrives at @entity20 today despite missing two months of school after the clot was discovered , miss @entity1 still managed to achieve six as and four bs in her gcses			1
recording a verdict of death by natural causes , coroner @entity118 said : ' professor @entity45 could n’t find anything structural that could confirm the cause of death			0
' his conclusion is that on the balance of probabilities she had some form of seizure - related death			2
i see no reason to dispute those findings			0
' there was nothing untoward about this death - but given we ’re talking about the death of a 19 - year - old , that ’s perhaps not the right word			0
' i realise there is nothing i can say that offers any comfort but i do offer my condolences			0
i am very sorry that you had to come here			0
' after the inquest , @entity1 ’s devastated mother @entity42 , who attended the hearing with husband @entity51 , 51 , and @entity1 ’s grandparents , paid tribute to her daughter - saying she had loved her job and had enjoyed going out with her many friends at weekends			1
