a goal against @entity1 is the stuff of which childhood dreams are made			1
the image likely crossed @entity6 ’s mind when he was kicking about the playground of @entity8			2
@entity6 returned to his old school in @entity10 on wednesday for a promotional visit having just realised that very feat. yet jubilation was the furthest thing from his mind			2
the @entity16 left - back admitted a first strike for his nation meant little in the context of a 3 - 1 defeat from @entity22 ’s classy side at @entity23			1
@entity25 scores for @entity16 at @entity23 during tuesday 's 3 - 1 defeat to @entity1 @entity16 international @entity6 returned to his old school on wednesday for a promotional visit sharply critical of his own defensive display , @entity6 insisted he would gladly have traded his brief moment of glory for blanking out @entity1 at the other end of the field			1
that kind of clear - eyed self - analysis perhaps speaks volumes of why the 20 - year - old has enjoyed such extraordinary progress over the past 18 months			1
while family and friends would have wanted to re-live the left - foot strike that zipped inside ’s @entity43 ’s near post , @entity6 spent tuesday night agonising over the other 89 minutes			1
‘ i did n’t get much sleep , ’ he admitted			2
‘ i went straight home and straight to bed , but there was a lot of tossing and turning			2
i was more trying to think about my defensive performance , not the goal			2
‘ i ’ll find out in time about being able to reflect on the goal but for now it ’s at the back of my mind			1
i ’m more disappointed about the overall performance and my own performance			2
‘ it ’s tough one			2
a normal person would probably have been delighted to score against @entity1 to get their first goal for @entity16			1
but i ’ve already forgotten about it			0
we got beat 3 - 1 and that ’s the most annoying thing for me			1
@entity6 worked his way up from the fourth tier of @entity67 football to the @entity68 ‘ i thought i could have done better personally in a defensive sense			1
and first and foremost i am a defender			1
so if i could have swapped the goal for a clean sheet i would have taken it			0
‘ i was obviously delighted to see it hit the back of the net			1
it was a proud moment for me and my family			0
maybe for that minute or two i could just enjoy the feeling and hope that i ’d helped us get back into the game			1
sadly , though , @entity1 went up the park and scored again			1
’ @entity6 ’s goal came seven minutes from the end and was made at @entity83			1
after feeding the ball to fellow former @entity86 player @entity85 , he gave the returned cutback the finish it deserved			0
by that point , @entity1 were already two in front			1
@entity91 struck first when he ghosted off @entity6 ’s flank and behind @entity93 to convert a sublime delivery from @entity95			0
@entity96 then claimed the first of his brace by heading home a loose ball that had rebounded off @entity6			0
both concessions gave the @entity103 defender cause for regret			1
‘ looking back at the first goal , i probably should have tucked in and tried to block him , ’ reflected @entity6			2
‘ even if i did , it was an absolutely world - class ball so i do n’t know how much i would have been able to stop it			2
but i would have been much happier if i had followed him in and tried to stop it , rather than just letting him go			0
@entity6 has worked his way up from playing amateur football with @entity114 to the @entity68 ‘ for the second goal , it could probably happen another 100 times and not fall on @entity96 ’s head			1
i did n’t have much time to react			0
i did n’t know if someone was behind me so i felt i had to get a leg on it			0
unfortunately , it went to the head of a deadly finisher			0
i was n’t so annoyed with that one but i felt i should still have done better			0
‘ we got ourselves back to 2 - 1 for a short time but @entity1 deserved to win overall			1
it was disappointing we could n’t put pressure on them for the last 10 minutes			0
instead , they went up the pitch and scored again so quickly			2
but , as i said , looking back on the game we can have no complaints about the result			2
’ it was a score - line that also prevented the old @entity67 trait of getting ahead of ourselves from rearing its head			1
the national side ’s development under @entity141 has been substantial and rightly lauded			0
friday night ’s win over the @entity143 was the most significant for years and left us firmly in contention for a place at @entity146			2
@entity1 ’s visit was , however , a reminder of the distance still to be travelled , of how only a maximum collective effort can thwart teams of superior quality			1
‘ on tuesday night , the @entity154 players were a better standard than us , ’ @entity6 recognised			0
‘ but we did n’t play to our best			0
hopefully we can get a shot at them again and show what we can do			0
‘ the next time the squad meets up , we can analyse it and see what went wrong			0
that will help us for the future			0
@entity6 impressed @entity141 after being invited to join in a training session with the senior team ‘ there were a lot of fans and media saying we were a good team but we knew we still had work to do			0
we ’ve got off to a good start in the @entity146 campaign , which is the main thing overall , and hopefully we can kick on from there			0
the priority for us is to get back to the top end of international football at a major tournament finals			1
’ it is four months until @entity16 are back in action against @entity180			1
barring the calamity to end all calamities , the next truly meaningful game is the trip to @entity185 next june			0
@entity6 will complete a first season in the @entity68 in the interim , having been playing part - time football with @entity114 as recently as may 2013			1
‘ if you had said a year ago that i would have got five @entity16 caps in 2014 , i would have said you were a liar , ’ he insisted			1
‘ looking back on it , i ’m delighted i can represent my country in such big games			2
hopefully there are a lot more happy memories to come			0
‘ i do n’t really set myself targets and challenges			0
i just try and take everything that comes to me			0
we will see what is coming in 2015			0
hopefully we will still be talking about me playing for @entity16 and doing well for @entity103			1
’ @entity25 visited @entity8 ’s in support of @entity204 ’s @entity203 to promote the health benefits of the game			1
run in partnership with the @entity210 , it has so far involved over 82,000 children from more than 2,000 schools .			0

@entity25 scored for @entity16 in 3 - 1 defeat to @entity1
@entity103 defender has made it to the @entity68 from the fourth tier of @entity67 football
however , left back admits his first @entity16 strike means nothing following defeat to *rivals*
