by mail online reporter a retired army nurse is facing a council tax hike of £ 1,000 a year after inspectors ruled her property is actually two distinct homes			1
@entity6 will now get two monthly bills after her four - bedroom house in @entity9 , @entity10 , was judged to be ' two self - contained units '			1
miss @entity6 , who served with the @entity12 for 26 years , called the decision ' absolutely shocking '			1
but inspectors have held firm and dismissed her attempt to appeal			2
but now inspectors have told her that this ' granny flat ' section of her property could potentially be used as another home and ought to be billed accordingly			2
that means she will have to cough up the cash for lots of council tax , amounting to £ 2,500 a year , when previously she paid between £ 1,500 and £ 1,800 for a single property			1
' it ’s absolutely shocking because i ’ve owned this house since 1995 and i ’ve always paid my council tax , ' she said			1
' the extension was built well before i moved in here and now all of a sudden i ’m being told it ’s two separate houses			0
' there ’s only a flimsy door between the two so i do n’t think a family would want to live in that tiny space if there was another family right next door			0
' i used to pay around £ 1,600 to £ 1,800 tax as my house fell into the band f category			2
' but now i ’ve been told it will be split into two meaning it will be classified as a three - bedroom house and a one - bedroom flat under categories @entity60 and @entity61 ' miss @entity6 in her utility room - cum - second home			1
the decision means she will pay an extra £ 1,000 a year tax council inspectors told miss @entity6 that there was ‘ no breach of planning control ’ and that ‘ nothing has been compromised ’ at her property			1
she tried to reverse the decision but her appeal was dismissed at a valuations tribunal hearing , despite @entity75 officer @entity74 conceding it might not be possible to sell the building as two properties			0
miss @entity6 said : ' the process was incredibly confusing and whenever i tried to ask questions i felt like i was being ignored			1
' the council told me that i had n’t broken any rules by having the cooker and utility facilities in the extension when they visited in january			0
' but then the @entity75 evaluators came and said that it was two separate properties			0
' i was absolutely stunned so i asked them how it could possible be another house as it did n’t have a proper exit			0
' so people living there would have to come through into what would be the house next door			0
' it ’s only about three metres wide and three metres long anyway and is exactly the same size as it was in the original plans when i moved here			0
' i ’ve been all over the world in my job and i ’ve seen some pretty grim things but this whole situation has completely baffled me			0
' the letter from the council informing @entity107 of the change in her home 's council tax status a spokesman for the @entity75 ( @entity75 ) said : ' the @entity75 is responsible for allocating council tax bands in @entity113 in @entity114			1
' we can not comment on individual cases			0
' where part of an existing home is built or adapted for use as separate living accommodation , it may be treated as a self - contained unit and have its own council tax band			1
' if an occupier disagrees with that decision they can appeal			0
' the @entity75 is also happy to review the council tax band of any domestic property , free of charge and without an appeal			2
' billing authorities may also apply an exemption from the council tax bill			2
local councils will deal with any questions about payments and exemptions for council tax bills			2

@entity6 has paid a single bill for her home since moving in 20 years ago
but now council inspectors have ruled the house is ' two self - contained units '
the change means miss @entity6 must pay an extra £ 1,000 council tax a year
