by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 04:26 est , 31 october 2012 updated : 02:52 est , 1 november 2012 transport secretary @entity2 has repeatedly blamed civil servants for the £ 100million fiasco , insisting ministers are not to blame official investigators into the government ’s @entity8 franchise fiasco have demanded an electronic audit of @entity12 staff e-mails in a bid to unearth evidence of a biased ‘ @entity16 ’ campaign			1
transport secretary @entity2 made the admission today while giving evidence to the transport select committee			1
appearing alongside his permanent secretary @entity20 , he said the two independent investigations into the shambles had asked ministers and senior officials to instigate a ‘ e-mail capture ’ system to electronically scan for and root out any potentially biased internal references to sir @entity27 and @entity28 during their bid to retain the franchise			1
it follows allegations revealed in the @entity34 that there was an ‘ @entity40 ’ culture within the @entity12 which had been reflected in some ‘ derogatory ’ e-mails which pointed towards institutional bias among some staff			0
mr @entity2 admitted his department made ' very regrettable ' errors in its handling of the bidding process for @entity46 ’s busiest rail line			1
the minister was forced to explain to a select committee why his department ploughed ahead with the bidding process for the @entity8 contract despite knowing the process was flawed			1
mr @entity2 said ‘ basic mistakes ’ had led to a ‘ catastrophic failure			2
’ it would be a ‘ text book chapter ’ for future @entity57 training			0
the 13 - year deal was handed to rival firm @entity59 in august , but last month days after becoming mr @entity2 announced serious flaws had been found			1
the deal was cancelled , and ministers spent £ 1million drawing up plans for the government to take over running the line from @entity65 to @entity66 before asking sir @entity27 to continue providing services for up to a year			1
mr @entity2 told the transport select committee : ' mistakes which were made should not have been made			1
it is very regrettable and very serious for the department			0
‘ we have already apologised to the bidders involved and the taxpayers who have a right to expect better and i would repeat that			0
' an official report this week claimed the @entity80 was biased against sir @entity27 ’s @entity28 bid to continue running the @entity8 mainline			1
@entity83 , chairman of the committee , said the interim report ' can only be described as a damning indictment ’ of the @entity80			0
the fiasco was ‘ major catastrophe ’ that had huge implications for the whole of the rail franchise process , she added			2
but mr @entity2 insisted there were ‘ a lot of people who work incredibly hard in the department who had noth9ng to do with this @entity8 franchise and i would n’t want them to be condemned ’			2
he said it was now ‘ obvious ’ that decisions were taken by middle - ranking officials which were ‘ not referred up ’ to senior civil servants or ministers ’			1
the devastating interim report into the @entity8 fiasco made for uncomfortable reading for the @entity80			2
the key findings of @entity110 's investigation included : asked if he was grateful to sir @entity27 ’s for launching a legal challenge which highlighted the flaws , mr @entity2 added : ‘ i think the country owes a debt of gratitude to @entity27 for all he has achieved in the rail and aviation industries			1
’ but his comments appeared at odds with revelations about his department 's attitude to sir @entity27			0
insider witnesses described this culture as ‘ @entity127 ’ or – ‘ anyone but @entity27			0
’ they said it had its roots in @entity28 ’s successful and tough re-negotiaton of its franchise in 2006 which had left @entity134 officials feeling battered and ‘ nailed to the floor ’ after being outwitted by a smarter virgin team			1
asked by mps whether staff e-mails were to be scanned as part of the investigation mr @entity2 said : ’ they have asked for it to be done			1
we have now received a request			0
’ asked if he could have asked more questions to unearth earlier the scale of the fiasco , mr @entity2 said : ' perhaps i could have asked more questions but i would have got the same answers			1
’ mr @entity20 side - stepped questions about ‘ who knew what and when ’ by insisting he could not comment on it because the matter was still the subject of a ‘ @entity157 ’ investigated by personnel officials			2
three staff have already been suspended			0
mr @entity20 said : ’ it would be wrong to pre-empt that investigation by saying who i believe is responsible			0
’ he said the ‘ risks ’ should have been ‘ escalated ’ to senior officials and ministers as soon as they were known , but were not : ’ the question of who knew what , when will come out when these investigations , including the @entity171 are completed			2
virgin trains boss sir @entity27 branded the bidding process ' insane ' and launched a legal challenge			1
he was vindicated this week when an official report said the @entity80 was biased against him on monday the interim report into the fiasco concluded that the @entity12 was biased against sir @entity27 ’s bid to continue running the @entity8 mainline			1
but that was just one of a catalogue of failures – including of leadership - which contributed to the shambles , it concluded			0
the independent investigation into the scandal by @entity188 chief executive @entity110 highlights ‘ significant errors ’ , ‘ weak governance ’ , and a ‘ flawed process ’ with in which ‘ bidders were treated inconsistently			2
’ but the report also highlights contributory factors including a general lack of leadership , late planning , hurried execution , and cut - backs within the transport department which put key decisions into the hands of relatively junior , inexperienced and ‘ stretched ’ staff			1
today mr @entity2 apologised to taxpayers who are now facing a £ 40million bill – which could rise to £ 100million - following mr @entity2 's decision to scrap the @entity8 franchise process following the finding of serious errors by the @entity80			1
mrs @entity83 asked the @entity12 ’s top civil servant mr @entity20 , who only took up his post this summer , who at the department had taken the decision to go on with the bidding process regardless			1
mr @entity20 replied : " i am afraid that i am not going to answer that question " saying that investigations into the whole matter were still going on			0
the @entity110 report also said the companies bidding for the franchise were not provided with adequate information , the @entity80 did not follow its own guidance , and the evaluation of the financial robustness of the bids was " developed late , in a hurry and without proper planning and preparation "			2
mr @entity110 said the @entity80 had undergone staff reductions and frequent changes of leadership , and organisational changes and the department 's structure " resulted in a lack of clarity around allocation of repsonsibility " for the bidding competition			2
he concluded that these factors raised " potentially significant issues about the ability of the @entity80 effectively to conduct rail franchise competitions "			0
mr @entity20 said that when he arrived at the department in july he had received assurances that the @entity8 process was " going well "			0
he said it was not until october that defects and errors associated with the process became clear			0
the @entity59 had been due to take over the @entity8 line on december 9			2
the government is now in discussions with @entity28 about it continuing to run services for up to 14 months until an interim franchise competition is held ahead of a competition for a full franchise			0
the @entity80 , under the leadership of the then transport secretary @entity261 , had decided in august to award a new 13 year @entity8 franchise rival transport company @entity59 for £ 7billion - £ 700million motre than sir richard ’s @entity28 bid			1
three civil servants have been suspended by the @entity266 as a result of the fiasco			0
but one of them , @entity269 , the department 's commercial and technical services director , issued a statement through her lawyers shortly after her suspension saying her role in the @entity8 process had been ‘ inaccurately portrayed mainly due to statements and other comment made by the @entity80 itself ’			0
she added : ‘ i would like to make it clear that i did not have lead responsibility for this project and that neither i nor any member of my team had any responsibility for the economic modelling for this project , or for any @entity80 project			0
‘ nor did i have any responsibility for the financial modelling in respect of this project and i have not been involved in briefing @entity80 ministers or other government ministers in respect of this project			0
