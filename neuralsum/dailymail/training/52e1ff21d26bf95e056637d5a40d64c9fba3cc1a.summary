new figures from the @entity22 show how the proportion of teenagers in full - time education who also have a job has fallen sharply in the last decade @entity28 mp @entity27 , who obtained the figures , said having a saturday job was a ' rite of passage ' for young people to experience the world of work the economic crash has meant fewer part - time jobs are available for students while increasing numbers of exams mean many feel under pressure to study not work			1

‘ if there are fewer young people doing saturday jobs and paper rounds you are that much less likely to get used to having a bad boss and all the things which are like a rite of passage			1
’ mr @entity27 , who obtained the figures through parliamentary questions , said there were several reasons for the fall			2
‘ fewer people now get papers delivered , people do n’t have their milk delivered and so on			0
‘ there is also something about how hard kids work these days and how much more they are examined			0
they are doing more subjects in the lower sixth and have more exams and they do feel the pressure of academic achievement			0
in some areas paperboys are being replaced by older people who are thought to be more reliable ‘ i do n’t want to force any 15 , 16 or 17 year old into any particular job but most of us would say that actually doing some work is beneficial thing			1

' the education select committee has launched an inquiry into careers guidance for young people			0
@entity145 , the manufacturers organisation , told the inquiry : ‘ if … young people are not proactively seeking work outside of their studies , then there is the risk that young people will not have any form of work experience upon leaving the education system , which will significantly impact their employability skills and prospects for the future			0
’ the @entity157 said there should be more ‘ encouragement for pupils to take on internships , voluntary activities and saturday jobs , to gain work experience and insight into working life ’ .			2
