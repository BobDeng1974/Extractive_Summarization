by @entity0 prosecutors in @entity2 will not seek criminal charges against the woman whose 11 - month - daughter died after being left in her car in 90 - degree heat for hours			1
@entity10 attorney @entity9 said going after april @entity11 for the aug. 1 death of little @entity13 ' is not in the interest of justice , ' @entity8 reported			2
' because the purpose of the criminal justice system is to penalize a conscious wrongdoer , justice will not be served prosecuting april @entity11 , because she was not blameworthy of mind , ' @entity9 wrote , according to the @entity21			2
' the evidence shows that april was a loving , thoughtful caregiver who was operating under lack of sleep , changed routine , and stress			1
' tragic loss : april @entity11 , 32 , left her 11 - month - old daughter @entity13 in a hot parked car for hours on aug. 1 too young : @entity31 was the only daughter of @entity33 and @entity11			1
pictured above with her parents and two older brothers @entity31 was just one week short of her first birthday when @entity11 broke her normal routine and brought her beloved daughter along in the car to drop off her two young sons with a babysitter			1
but the urgent need to use the restroom meant april parked her car and rushed back into her home , leaving @entity31 behind in the hot parked car			1
it was only when she went back to the car around 1pm that she noticed her grave mistake			2
paramedics life - flighted @entity31 in extremely critical condition to @entity52 where she was pronounced dead			0
above , a view of the neighborhood where @entity13 was found after several hours in a hot parked car neither april nor her husband @entity33 have made statements regarding their only daughter 's death , but @entity11 's sister @entity61 said the tragedy was an accident			1
' rather than abandoning @entity31 , [ @entity65 ] acted under the erroneous belief that @entity31 was napping safely in her bedroom crib , ' @entity9 wrote			0
the prosecutor added , ' an unconscious lapse of awareness is substantially different than a conscious decision to leave a baby in a car			0
' mother and daughter pictured above in a shot from dad @entity33 's @entity79 page april @entity80 says that @entity13 's death was the result of a change of routine for her sister , who usually has a neighbor look after her daughter while she takes the boys to a babysitter			0
but she decided to take @entity31 along for the ride that day			0
there was construction going on in the neighborhood so mrs @entity11 had to park a few blocks away from her home , where she does nails in her in - house salon while watching @entity31			0
mrs @entity11 rushed out of the car after parking , since she needed to use the restroom , and went about her day under the impression she took @entity31 out of the car and put her down for nap as usual			1
she found her daughter hours later when she went back to the car to pick up her sons			2
sweltering : the temperature when @entity13 was found in the car was 90 degrees			0
@entity13 and her mother pictured above spending the day by a river			0

@entity31 was left inside a hot parked car for hours on @entity117
@entity119 thought the girl had gone down for a nap and did *n't* realize her mistake until she returned to the car pick up her sons
prosecutor says filing criminal charges against the mother is ' not in the interest of justice '
evidence *suggests* she was overly tired and stressed because of a ' changed routine '
