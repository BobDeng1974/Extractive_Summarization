by @entity0 , @entity1 @entity3 chairman @entity2 says this has been a ' dream summer ' for the club , with the mass exodus actually helping them become stronger on and off the field			2
following their best ever @entity11 campaign , @entity9 's witnessed an unparalleled and , at times , uncomfortable talent drain			2
the departure of manager @entity15 and his coaching staff to @entity17 was quickly followed by @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 moving on to pastures new			1
@entity20 was among those to leave @entity3 in the summer when he joined @entity25 for £ 25m the odds on @entity3 being relegated dramatically cut after those exits , although the club acted quickly to allay fears by appointing highly - regarded @entity30 before bringing in eight new players			1
it is a case of so far so good for the new - look side , who head into saturday 's match with @entity36 on the back of a 3 - 1 win at @entity39 and a transfer - window profit of more than £ 30million			1
' we feel we 're in a stronger position than we entered this crazy transfer window , ' chairman @entity2 said			2
' if someone had told me in the middle of may that - after the outs , including the managerial team , and the ins - we would be standing here speaking about what we have , i would say that would be a dream summer			1
' we 've had amazing financial discipline throughout it all			2
we still have a lot of work to do in the club			2
we did n't do everything perfectly this summer			0
we are never going to say that			0
@entity19 moved to @entity61 for £ 31.5m after being in the @entity63 squad at @entity64 ' we know we have a lot of lessons to take out of our summer steps , but they will help us in the future , for sure			1
' such positivity flies in the face of what some dubbed a ' meltdown ' at @entity9 's , where the summer exits only served to compound the january departure of divisive executive chairman @entity76			0
it is talk @entity2 continues to laugh off , saying @entity3 have always ' kept moving forwards ' with a long - term view - one which gives them more strength in depth than before			1
' there was a time in the summer where everybody would be thankful just for the team to be slightly competitive , ' he said , speaking at club partner @entity88 's stand at the @entity89			0
' i think we are more than slightly competitive now and we just have to stay patient			0
' there are a lot of changes			0
there are eight new players from outside , five new from inside ( promoted from the academy ) - that 's 13 players that need to be integrated			1
' we 've got a new management staff , so we 're very patient			1
the potential of this group will not necessary show up in the next few weeks			0
@entity3 have made a promising start to the season despite the summer exodus ' everybody around it needs to understand that all this change needs some time , let it be a one - off as far as the amount of change			1
' we do n't expect in the next transfer windows to come anywhere close to this kind of a situation again			0
' we 're doing everything possible to prevent that , which i think is comfort for those who i know went through sleepless nights - and , trust me , we did too			1
' the future of @entity125 and , in particular , @entity123 were the main concerns towards the end of the window , yet @entity3 retained both players despite interest and intense speculation			1
' when we made the decision as a club , i have to say that there were conversations afterwards , but it never got uncomfortable , ' @entity2 said			0
' it never left the realm of being respectful and i respect @entity123 even more today than i did when this all started , just because of the end process , the decisions we made and we gave him time			0
' i said right from the start that i was never upset about his immediate reaction , knowing that we 're all human beings and that can happen			0
' over time he 's shown so much character and his reaction has been on the pitch to be the best possible player he can be and to accept the decision			0
' it 's a great example for an approach where a club and a player maybe has differences , but always deals eye - to - eye , we communicated very openly with each other			2
