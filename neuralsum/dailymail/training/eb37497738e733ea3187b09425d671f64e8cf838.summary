by @entity1 correspondent published : 10:58 est , 27 september 2012 updated : 11:00 est , 27 september 2012 if you think pop music ai n’t what it used to be , you may well be right			1
research shows that today ’s songs are slower and sadder than those of the past			0
and if this dreariness was n’t depressing enough , they also last longer			0
the researchers , who analysed more than 1,000 hits from 1965 to 2009 , blame the loss of the feel - good factor on modern acts wanting to be seen as serious and complex - and on listeners who like to think they are more sophisticated			1
researchers say that modern pop music is sadder than slower than when the @entity19 and @entity20 ruled the charts - but they admit @entity22 is the excetion			1
as a result , unambiguously uplifting songs like the @entity19 ’ help ! or she loves you are few and far between			0
the researchers , from @entity29 and @entity30 universities , analysed tempo and key of many of the biggest hits of the last 60 years			1
in general , a fast tempo and major key makes for a happy song , while a slow beat and minor key denotes misery			0
the analysis found the proportion of songs recorded in the minor key to have doubled , allowing sadder tones to predominate			0
modern pop songs also tend to be slower , with just 100 beats per minute , compared with the 116 of the 1960s , and the average duration of a recording has increased from just under three minutes to almost four minutes			1
the study , from the @entity53 and @entity54 , also found mismatch of a minor key with a fast beat to have become more common			0
this , said the researchers could be an attempt to appeal to an audience that thinks it is more sophisticated than those of the past			1
they said that this change in tastes has left up - beat hits of the past such as @entity20 ’s @entity69 sounding ‘ naïve and slightly juvenile to contemporary ears ’			0
@entity72 supergroup @entity20 were also named as one of the great purveyors of the best pop. and modern , up - beat tunes recorded in the major key , such as @entity79 ’s @entity78 are often dismissed as being gimmicks			2
however , there is at least one best - selling singer who has managed to buck the trend , by recording fast - paced songs in a major key or mode to critical and popular acclaim			0
writing in the journal @entity89 , the researchers said : ‘ @entity22 has somehow managed to transcend this association			1
‘ her fast - tempo , major mode recordings such as @entity94 and @entity96 sound fresh while recalling or quoting popular music from an earlier time			2
’ the findings chime with research released earlier this year which concluded that today ’s pop music is louder and blander than the hits of the 1950s and 1960s			1
the computer analysis of almost half a million pop , rock and hip hop songs from 1955 to 2010 , revealed today ’s tracks to be louder , which researchers said is because sound engineers and producers are cranking up the volume at the recording stage			1
the researchers singled out @entity22 as one of the few modern artists who can match classic pop. as a result , if two tracks are turned up to the same volume level on a cd player home , the more recent will sound louder			1
apparently this is not due to better recording equipment , but is an attempt to make music that catches attention and is suitable for playing in noisy venues			2
the @entity131 study also found evidence that the chords used and the changes between them are simpler , leading to the production of music that is easy on the ear but contains little variety			2
researcher @entity139 , of @entity141 ’s @entity140 , said : ‘ i think this is related to the role of music			2
‘ in the 1950s and 60s , music was more artistic and for getting messages across			0
‘ now it ’s about dancing and relaxing ... with groups not so interested in experimenting			0

researchers say modern music has lost the ' *feelgood* factor '
claim the only artist to have carried on the *tradition* of ' pure pop ' is @entity22
