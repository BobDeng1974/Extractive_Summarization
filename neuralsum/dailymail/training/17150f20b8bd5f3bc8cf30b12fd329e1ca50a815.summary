the @entity3 club in @entity9 , @entity11 where mr @entity8 was an afternoon regular miss @entity7 , who wiped away tears as she gave evidence at the inquest , said : ' as i got in i realised i had left it in gear			1
i turned the ignition on and it started to move and hit the top of the steps			2
' i was just trying to get the car away from him ' the inquest heard how miss @entity7 had been taking her father to the club every sunday for around two years			1
he would arrive at 1pm and would mix with other club members , drinking a shandy and a whisky before being picked up at 3pm			2
there are two elements to unintentional acceleration syndrome which are acknowledged by psycho - analysts			1
the first is where the driver makes and error with the foot position of their vehicle			2
the second is where , as the vehicle accelerates , the driver 's initial reaction is to press harder on what they think is the brake			2
miss @entity7 added : ' i pulled up ( to the steps )			0
i needed to get his sticks for him			0
' i jumped out , passed him his sticks , took him to the top of the stairs and took one stick off him because he could n't manage two with the handrail			0
' i went back to the car because i had to move it			0
' club member @entity69 , who was having a cigarette in the smoking area a few feet away from the incident , also gave evidence at the inquest			1
he said : ' i heard what sounded like tyres screeching behind me			0
' i turned around to face up the steps and saw a blue car coming down the steps			0
' @entity80 was on my right hand side			0
the car came down and veered slightly to my right and struck @entity80			2
' it was very close and i did n't know which way it was going to go and i had to decide which way to jump			0
' i jumped to my left and then the car struck the front of the club			1
' after the accident the engine was still being revved , and the inquest heard how a club member had to shout to shocked miss @entity7 to turn the engine off			1
forensic collision investigator @entity97 was called to the scene and also gave evidence at the inquest			2
in a ' momentary lapse ' miss @entity7 put her @entity18 ( like the one pictured ) into reverse , then panicked and accelerated into her elderly father he said : ' unintentional acceleration syndrome , sometimes referred to as spontaneous acceleration syndrome , is an unexpected , inadvertent acceleration - the unintentional pressing of the accelerator instead of the brake or gear			1
' at the close of the hearing coroner mr @entity112 recorded a verdict that mr @entity8 's death was accidental			1
he said : ' let me first express my sympathy			0
' it is a terrible situation to find yourself in and clearly one that was not intended at all			0
' but it takes just a momentary lapse , that slightest confusion and things happen			1
' it is a second 's confusion when you believe you have done one thing when in fact you have done another			0
' it is one of those things , but what a consequence			0
it is very difficult and i 'm sure it is very painful			0
