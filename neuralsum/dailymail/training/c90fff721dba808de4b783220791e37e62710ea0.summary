by @entity0 from buildings built by the @entity2 to ornate theatres , burnt out hotels and eerie sanatoriums , these are the abandoned buildings that still litter the powerhouse of @entity8			1
photographer @entity9 , 30 , from @entity10 travelled to the @entity12 capital @entity13 and the surrounding countryside to capture buildings in need of work on film			1
far from being resplendent in vintage glory , the deserted music venues and crumbling hospitals are a shadow of their former selves			1

the site was also used as a driving training centre until the @entity39 took control of the area , taking over a day after the @entity12 abandoned it april 26 , 1945 a gym / basketball court at @entity30			2

mr @entity9 said : ' i stumbled into photography via my degree , which was in restoration			1
my interest in abandonments started really young			2
' when i was five my junior school had a derelict aeroplane in an adjoining field			2
two of my friends and i climbed over the 10ft green wire mesh fence and entered the plane			0
' if i close my eyes i can still picture the switches , dials and smell the leather			0
' i find abandoned buildings to photograph by word of mouth or a little bit of research			0
' to gain access to some of the locations is quite another story and can involve a lot of climbing , sneaking and hiding			0
' the best and most interesting thing about photographing abandoned buildings in @entity12 has to be the clash between different opposing ideologies that dominated this region in the mid to late 20th century			0
' there is almost nothing else similar to it around the globe			0
' the way it effected the material fabric of these lost places and the way it continues to effect the region as a whole , is i believe unique			0
' there are more than 60 buildings at the sanatorium which are looking for a new lease of life an undamaged guest room in the burnt out hotel looks almost lived in , but very dated seen better days : the main dining table in the abandoned and burnt out hotel left to rot : a barber 's chair in a manor house that once acted as a sanatorium the grand staircase at the @entity121 that has been daubed with graffiti			0
the site is south of @entity13			1

in its time it was also used as a hospital by the @entity141 until @entity12 reunification the arches around a courtyard inside the old sanatorium daubed with graffiti			0
