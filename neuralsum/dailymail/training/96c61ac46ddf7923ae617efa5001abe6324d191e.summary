an @entity1 ' wonder drug ' could be made available on the @entity2 , in what has been hailed as the most significant breakthrough against the virus in a generation			1
a landmark trial in @entity8 is to be sped up after interim analysis of the the drug @entity11 found it to be ' highly protective against @entity1 '			1
campaigners have urged the @entity2 to offer the medication – which has been approved for use in the @entity15 since 2012 – to vulnerable groups as soon as possible			1
a ' wonder drug ' which can reduce the risk of contracting @entity1 by 92 per cent could be offered on the @entity2 , as a landmark trial into the drug 's use could be sped up @entity15 guidelines say the tablet offers up to a 92 per cent reduction in the risk of contracting @entity1 - if taken every day			1
@entity11 is a drug which provides ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ' ( @entity27 )			1
this involves giving antiretroviral drugs - usually prescribed to treat @entity1 - to people who do n't have the virus but are at a high risk of exposure to it			1
@entity8 have now set up a group looking into the viability offering @entity11 on the @entity2 , as it is already known @entity27 effectively protects against @entity1			1
as part of the trial , @entity11 was prescribed to 407 men taking part in a study in @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			2
a further 138 men who were on the ' deferred arm ' of the trial , originally due to receive the drug in a year 's time , will now be offered it immediately			0
pre-exposure prophylaxis , or @entity27 , is a way for people who do not have @entity1 but who are at substantial risk of getting it to prevent @entity1 infection by taking a pill every day			1
the pill ( brand name @entity11 ) contains two medicines ( tenofovir and emtricitabine ) that are used in combination with other medicines to treat @entity1			1
when someone is exposed to @entity1 through sex or injection drug use , these medicines can work to keep the virus from establishing a permanent infection			2
when taken consistently , @entity27 has been shown to reduce the risk of hiv infection in people who are at high risk by up to 92per cent			2
@entity27 is much less effective if it is not taken consistently			0
@entity27 is a powerful hiv prevention tool and can be combined with condoms and other prevention methods to provide even greater protection than when used alone			0
but people who use @entity27 must commit to taking the drug every day and seeing their health care provider for follow - up every three months			1
source : centres for @entity86 and @entity87 lead researcher dr @entity88 , from the @entity89 at @entity90 , who led the proud study told @entity92 : ' it ’s the first hiv prevention trial of this scale that ’s ever been done in the @entity95			0
' to fast - track the trial is completely unexpected			1
when we started we did n't expect we would achieve a result in this number			0
' we were just seeing if we could recruit enough men			0
' this is a real key piece of evidence that the policy group will put forward to make the case for the drug to be available on the @entity2			2
' these are great results , but we really want to understand them			0
she added that a national trial could provide more information that would help @entity8 make its decision			2
she said : ' the early adopters might be very good at taking the tablets ' a national study might find people might not be so good at taking them			0
' we need to look at how long people stay on it , do people carry on taking it ? ' she added : ' a hiv test only gives you the results for your status six weeks ago			0
so you could leave the clinic today with a @entity1 negative and be highly infectious			2
' so @entity27 has a key role for people in between hiv tests			0
' it ’s really exciting , and i ’m not going to give up			0
you do n’t do research if you do n’t want it to be put into clinical practice			0
' the results of the trial will be published early next year and it is hoped that it could be rolled out nationally in 2017			0
the study includes @entity1 - negative gay and bisexual men and transgender women who reported having anal sex without condoms recently			2
all participants were offered regular testing for @entity1 and sexually transmitted infections , condoms and safer sex support			0
researchers hope to answer questions such as whether @entity27 will lead to a reduction in the use of condoms and its impact on the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases			2
@entity11 has been approved for use in the @entity15 since 2012 , and is recommended for groups at high risk of exposure to @entity1 , such as non-monogamous couples and people who inject drugs dr @entity161 , chief executive at @entity162 , said : ' this is potentially the most exciting development in hiv prevention in some years			1
' for a trial to be fast - tracked in this way is rare , and shows just how much confidence researchers have in @entity27 as a tool to reduce the spread of @entity1			1
' a number of questions remain unanswered , including how @entity27 will be made available and who will be able to access it			0
' the @entity174 study has accelerated their part of the process			0
' we will now be looking to the @entity2 to match that pace , and act swiftly to ensure those most at risk of @entity1 in the @entity95 can access @entity27			1
' @entity15 studied found participants who took @entity11 every day reduced their hiv infection risk by up to 92 per cent @entity183 , director of policy and campaigns at @entity186 ( @entity186 ) , said : ' the announcement that the proud study has already shown such a significant benefit in preventing @entity1 transmission is exciting and welcome news			1
' @entity1 transmission in the @entity95 remains far too high , especially among gay men , and we need to add to the prevention options available			0
these encouraging results provide powerful evidence that @entity27 should be accessible to all who need it as soon as possible			0
' at the end of 2013 , 35 million people were living with @entity1 , according to @entity200 statistics			0
in may this year , the @entity201 in the @entity15 recommend that @entity27 be considered for people who are @entity1 - negative and at substantial risk for @entity1			1
this includes gay or bisexual men who have had unprotected sex in the last six months , men who do not regularly use condoms , someone in a relationship with a person who is @entity1 - positive and people who inject drugs			2
the decision followed from studies which found that taking @entity11 daily reduced the risk of @entity1 by an average of 44 per cent when compared with a placebo			1
a quarter of participants who took @entity11 every day reduced their hiv infection risk by 92 per cent compared with a placebo , although researchers warned this could be an overestimate , as people who took their drug many have also reduced the risk in other ways .			1
