just six months since @entity1 unveiled designs of its @entity4 handsets , engineers have already created the first working prototype			1
dubbed spiral 1 , an engineer is shown turning on the device , unlocking it and launching an app during a video filmed at @entity12 in @entity13			1
individual modules are shown being added to , and removed , from the handset including the led module , battery , processor , speaker , and a usb port			1
individual modules are shown being added to , and removed , from the handset including the led module , battery , processor , speaker , and a usb port ' the first step is figuring out how is this is going to work , ' explained the creative agency			1
' what are going to be the functions of the different parts of the system ? and then from there , we select specific components and draw schematics			0
' according to the developer kit , @entity4 phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies , it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module			2
each phone will have a central ' spine ' and an endoskeleton - nicknamed ' endo ' - made of ribs that the individual modules will clip on to			1
there will be three different sized endos - including mini , medium and large - to rival the existing range of phones currently on the market , from compacts to phablets			0
larger phones will be able to accomodate either larger , or additional modules , than the mini will			2
@entity1 's kit describes various modules including batteries , @entity66 and @entity67 chips , cameras , speakers and more			2
in theory , any sensor that can be fitted to a module will be able to attach to a module and while @entity1 will make the shell , these modules will be made by other companies			2
by printing their own parts , users will also be able to customise them			0
' once you have a layout , you get the boards fabricated			0
' it ’s magical when you open up the box and say " oh my goodness , that ’s the thing we ’ve spent all these months designing			0
" the firm continued that when the power is applied for the first time to the modules , it 's what is known as the @entity95			0
' your primary thought at that point is , is this thing going to start smoking ? ' continued the engineer			0
' is it going to overheat ? is there some critical error or not ? and then , once we have the individual pieces working we put them into the complete system			0
' in the video , a board is shown fitted with connectors			2
the designers then demonstrate sliding the components in and out			0
in the @entity115 prototype , 50 per cent of the phone is taken up by the modules , but @entity117 has made custom chips for @entity119 , which the company said will increase the amount of space on the device			1
@entity119 will be demonstrated at a developer ’s conference on 14 january			1
according to the developer kit files released in april , @entity4 phones will be able run on multiple batteries - when one battery dies , it can be detached and replaced with a full battery module			2
lower - resolution cameras can be swapped with higher - res versions , and users will be also be able to @entity137 replacement parts			0
