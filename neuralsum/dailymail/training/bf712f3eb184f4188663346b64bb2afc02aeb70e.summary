by @entity0 , chief political correspondent published : 19:19 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 05:13 est , 23 september 2013 @entity2 's flagship immigration policy was unravelling last night hours after it was launched			1
@entity3 announced that all firms bringing in skilled staff from outside @entity6 should be forced to take on an equal number of ‘ local ’ apprentices			1
the @entity2 leader , who has struggled to get on the front foot on immigration , said the policy would cut the recruitment of migrants by businesses and improve the skills of @entity18 youngsters			1
top team : labour leader @entity3 ( right ) chats with shadow chancellor @entity20 and shadow chief secretary to the treasury @entity21 backstage , during the first day of @entity2 's annual party conference in @entity24 but – under pressure from the @entity26 – @entity2 was later forced to admit that the 125,000 apprenticeships envisaged by the scheme would be open to youngsters from across the @entity30			1
the idea also met a backlash from the business lobby , which warned the new ‘ apprentice tax ’ would damage competitiveness and fail to tackle immigration			1
' immigration benefits @entity18 ' : @entity38 , director general of the @entity39 , said businesses should be able to choose the talents and resources the need a shadow cabinet source insisted the policy had been discussed with senior industry figures , adding : ‘ business is cool with this			1
’ but @entity48 , of the @entity49 , said the initiative would make it ‘ even harder ’ for firms to take on staff			0
‘ several of @entity2 ’s proposals are completely removed from reality and betray the fact that their authors can have had no experience of running a business , ’ he said			1
‘ compelling companies to take on an apprentice for every @entity63 employee is a daft policy which would damage many small and medium - sized businesses just as they are starting to grow			1
’ @entity38 , of the @entity39 , said : ‘ this is an apprentice tax on employers and job creation			1
‘ it serves neither to control immigration , where we should have a points system linked more strongly to economic benefit , nor help young people , who should be encouraged and properly supported rather than being used to control immigration by other means			0
businesses need to be able to choose the talents and resources they need , and sometimes can not find in the @entity18			2
pressure : @entity3 announced that all firms bringing in skilled staff from outside @entity6 should be forced to take on an equal number of ¿ local ¿ apprentices ‘ penalising good companies by making the grant of a work permit conditional on taking on a @entity18 apprentice just raises business costs and new red tape			1
’ rumours abounded yesterday that @entity3 had had voice coaching to improve his public image			2
his voice appeared to have dropped an octave when he made a pre-conference appearance on the @entity99 ’s @entity98 yesterday			0
mr @entity3 ’s nasal voice has been the subject of speculation , especially over a 2011 nose operation to correct a deviated septum			2
labour sources denied voice coaching , saying a cold might explain his deeper voice			0
the last @entity2 government ’s ‘ open door ’ policy on migrants has faced fierce public criticism and mr @entity3 yesterday said he wanted a future administration to cut immigration levels			1
‘ i do want to get low - skill immigration down and therefore overall immigration down , ’ he said			0
the centrepiece of his plan , which he said would be in @entity2 ’s first @entity121 , would be the new policy on apprentices , affecting all firms employing more than 50 people			1
mr @entity3 said : ‘ any firm that wants to bring in a foreign worker from outside the @entity30 will also have to train up someone who is a local worker			1
’ @entity130 sources quickly pointed out that the measure would be illegal under @entity30 law unless youngsters from elsewhere in @entity6 were able to apply for the apprenticeships			2
@entity2 later climbed down , admitting that young people from across the @entity30 would be eligible			1
a source said the ‘ vast majority ’ of the apprenticeships were likely to go to @entity18 youngsters			1
but critics last night pointed out that the posts would be attractive to young people in countries such as @entity143 , where youth unemployment is running at more than 50 per cent			2
the @entity2 leader also announced he would increase fines on employers paying below the minimum wage from £ 5,000 to £ 50,000 as part of action against exploitation of migrant workers			2
he also said he wanted to see the minimum wage ‘ go up over time ’			0
an attempt by @entity2 to restore its battered economic credibility was running into trouble last night before it had even been launched			2
journalists had been briefed that shadow chancellor @entity20 will today pledge to have the party ’s tax and spending plans audited by the independent @entity163 to give them a gloss of respectability			0
shadow chancellor @entity20 has written to the @entity163 's chairman @entity166 asking him to amend the watchdog 's charter to allow it to scrutinise @entity2 's plans but last night it emerged that the @entity163 ’s charter prevents it from offering a view on the spending plans of opposition parties			1
the agency was set up by @entity178 to provide independent economic forecasts and scrutinise government spending plans			0
mr @entity20 has now written to the @entity163 ’s chairman @entity166 asking him to amend the watchdog ’s charter to allow it to scrutinise @entity2 ’s plans			2
the move came after treasury minister @entity184 released an analysis by officials which he said showed @entity2 promises would require more than £ 1,000 extra borrowing per household in 2015			0
the analysis suggested @entity2 ’s plans would blow a £ 28billion black hole in the nation ’s finances			0
mr @entity20 dismissed the report as ‘ nonsense ’			0
but today he will acknowledge the importance of having @entity2 ’s election plans fully costed to give voters confidence in them			0
he will say : ‘ in tough times it ’s even more important that all our policies and commitments are properly costed and funded			0
‘ the @entity18 people rightly want to know that the sums add up			0
so we will go one step further and ask the independent @entity163 – the watchdog set up by this government – to independently audit the costings of every individual spending and tax measure in @entity2 ’s manifesto at the next election			2
‘ this is the first time a shadow chancellor – the first time any political party in @entity18 – has ever said it wants this kind of independent audit			0
a radical change from what ’s gone before , but the right thing to do to help restore trust in politics			0
’ mr @entity20 will concede that @entity2 will face more tough choices and admit that growth and jobs ‘ can not magic the whole deficit away at a stroke ’ .			0

@entity2 's flagship policy to take on a @entity18 trainee for every worker from outside the @entity30 was unravelling last night
all companies with more than 50 staff would be hit by new rule
@entity3 says it would improve the skills of @entity18 youngsters
fears it could create a skills shortage if companies stop hiring
business leaders slam ' apprentice tax ' which fails to understand industry
