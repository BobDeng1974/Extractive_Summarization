controlling the mind , and actions , of another person sounds like something from a sci - fi film , but researchers have taken a step closer to making it a reality			0
a student , fitted with an @entity11 cap , has successfully controlled the hand of a friend when playing a video game using direct brain - to - brain communication			1
and the reaction was immediate , despite the two players being in different locations and not being told when the game would begin			2
the ' sender ' , which in this case was mr loser , thought about firing a cannon in a computer game			1
that signal was sent over the web directly to the brain of mr @entity22 , known as the ' receiver ' , whose hand twitched , pressed a touchpad and fired the cannon the researchers from the @entity36 successfully demonstrated that brains could directly communicate with each other using this technology in august 2013			1
during these early tests , researchers used brain stimulation to control the hands of another on a keyboard			0
to join the brains of @entity36 student @entity21 and @entity22 , they used electroencephalography ( @entity11 ) and transcranial magnetic stimulation			1
mr @entity21 was connected to an @entity11 machine , which reads brain activity and sends electrical pulses over the web in one room on the @entity36 - based campus			1
these signals were sent to mr @entity22 , sitting in another campus half a mile away , who was fitted with a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil placed near the part of the brain that controls hand movements			1
mr @entity21 was then told to think about firing a canon and intercepting rockets launched by a pirate ship on a video game			2
across campus , mr @entity22 was sitting wearing headphones in a dark room - with no ability to see the computer game - with his right hand positioned over a touchpad			1
when mr @entity21 thought about firing the cannon , the signals were sent to mr @entity22 , whose hand then twitched , which pressed the touchpad and fired the cannon			1
but these latest tests have improved the accuracy and effectiveness of the communication , and shown how it could soon be used in real - world examples			2

when mr @entity21 thought about firing the cannon , the signals were sent to mr @entity22 , whose hand then twitched , which pressed the touchpad and fired the cannon			1
in total , three pairs of students took part in the experiment to test the technology ’s accuracy across different groups			1
mr @entity21 ( pictured ) was connected to an electroencephalography ( @entity11 ) machine , which reads brain activity and sends electrical pulses over the web in one room on the @entity36 - based campus these signals were sent to mr @entity22 , sitting in another campus half a mile away , who was fitted with a transcranial magnetic stimulation coil ( @entity134 ) ( pictured ) placed near the part of the brain that controls hand movements			1
@entity134 is a noninvasive way of delivering stimulation to the brain to elicit a response researchers found that accuracy varied among the pairs , ranging from 25 to 83 per cent			2
misses mostly were due to a sender failing to accurately execute the thought to send the ‘ fire ’ command			1
the researchers were also able to quantify the exact amount of information that was transferred between the two brains			0
the human brain is made up of billions of active neurons that have around 105,600 miles ( 170,000 km ) of combined length			0
every time you have a thought , your brain produces weak but distinct electrical signals corresponding to it			0
the electrical impulse is generated by the chemical reaction between neurons , which can be measured			0
recording and deciphering those signals is called electroencephalography ( @entity11 ) , and it has been medically possible since 1924			2
‘ the new study brings our brain - to - brain interfacing paradigm from an initial demonstration to something that is closer to a deliverable technology , ’ said co-author dr @entity167 , a research assistant professor of psychology and a researcher at @entity36 ’s @entity170			1
‘ now we have replicated our methods and know that they can work reliably with walk - in participants			2
’ dr @entity181 , a computer scientist and engineer at the @entity36 who led the work , added : ' our results show that information extracted from one brain can be transmitted to another brain , ultimately allowing two humans to cooperatively perform a task using only a direct brain - to - brain interface			1
' such devices , which have been long cherished by science fiction writers , have the potential to not only revolutionise how humans communicate and collaborate , but also open a new avenue for investigating brain function			0
' a separate research team , from @entity198 in @entity199 , @entity200 , recently published results showing direct communication between two human brains			1
the technology makes it possible to control the body of another person with thoughts - something that professor @entity210 , played by @entity211 ( pictured centre ) was able to do in the @entity214 films and comics this graphic reveals how the process works			2
brain signals from the ' sender ' are recorded			0
when the computer detects imagined hand movements , a fire command is transmitted over the internet to the @entity134 machine , which causes an upward movement of the right hand of the ' receiver ' but that particular study only tested one sender brain , instead of different pairs , and was conducted offline instead of in real - time over the web			1

the @entity36 research team is planning to take the work a step further in an attempt to decode and transmit more brain processes			0
they are hoping to expand the types of information that can be transferred from brain to brain , including more complex visual and psychological phenomena such as concepts , thoughts and rules			0
the technologies used by the researchers for recording and stimulating the brain are both well - known			0
@entity11 , or @entity11 , is routinely used by clinicians and researchers to record brain activity noninvasively from the scalp			2
transcranial magnetic stimulation is a noninvasive way of delivering stimulation to the brain to elicit a response			0
its effect depends on where the coil is placed ; in this case , it was placed directly over the brain region that controls a person ’s right hand			0
by activating these neurons , the stimulation convinced the brain that it needed to move the right hand			0
they ’re also exploring how to influence brain waves that correspond with alertness or sleepiness			0
eventually , for example , the brain of a sleepy airplane pilot dozing off at the controls could stimulate the co-pilot ’s brain to become more alert			0
‘ imagine someone who ’s a brilliant scientist but not a brilliant teacher			0
‘ complex knowledge is hard to explain - we ’re limited by language , ’ said co-author @entity290 , a faculty member at the @entity170 and a @entity36 assistant professor of psychology			2
dr @entity167 added : ' we have envisioned many scenarios in which brain - to - brain technology could be useful			0
' a skilled surgeon could remotely control an inexperienced assistant ’s hands to perform medical procedures even it not on the site , or a skilled pilot could remotely help a less experienced one control a plane during a difficult situation			0
' it could help with neuro - rehabilitation			0
' after brain damage , patients need to painfully and slowly re-learn simple motor actions , such as walking , grasping , or swallowing			0
' we suspect that the re-learning phase could be greatly sped - up if we could provide the damaged brain with a ' motor template ' , copied from a healthy person , or the healthy part of the patient 's brain , of what the intended action should look like			0
earlier this year , a research team led by the @entity324 used @entity11 headsets to record electrical activity from neurons firing in the brain and send thoughts between participants ( pictured )			1
this was used to convert the words ‘ hola ’ and ‘ ciao ’ into binary in the initial test , the greeting was sent from a volunteer , known as an ' emitter ' ( illustrated left ) in @entity339 , @entity340 to a ' receiver ' in @entity342 , @entity343			2
there , a computer translated the message and then used electrical stimulation to implant it in the receiver ’s mind the research , published in @entity351 , was funded by the @entity352 and the @entity36 , with additional support from the @entity354			1

student , fitted with an @entity11 cap , successfully controlled the hand of a friend
the two students played a game in which cannons had to be fired on - screen
‘ @entity385 ’ thought about firing a cannon , which moved the hand of a ‘ receiver ’
students were sat half a mile apart , and brains were connected by the web
receiver ’s reaction was immediate and accuracy ranged from *23* **%** to 83 **%**
technology builds on similar research from @entity200 computer scientists
