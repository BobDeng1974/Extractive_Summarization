they are often depicted as dim - witted evolutionary losers , but @entity3 were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains , a new study suggests			1
instead , it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors , scientists believe			1
an analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years strips away some of the myths surrounding @entity3 and reveals they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought			1
why did @entity3 go extinct ? it 's often thought their lack of intelligent ultimately led to their demise , but new research suggests it may instead have been due to interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors the differences between the two human sub-species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the @entity3 , say the two @entity29 and @entity30 researchers			1
dr @entity31 , from the @entity32 , and professor @entity33 , from @entity34 , wrote in the online journal @entity36 : ' genetic studies now suggest that the debate on the demise of the @entity3 needs to be reframed in terms of some degree of interbreeding			2
' in that sense , @entity3 did not go extinct , even though their distinctive morphology did disappear			2
' we conclude that all the " archaeology - based " explanations for the demise of the @entity3 ... are flawed			2
' neanderthals thrived in @entity48 for 300,000 years but vanished around 40,000 years ago as early modern humans began to settle in @entity50			1
in the past , experts have theorised that @entity3 died out because they were mentally , technologically and culturally inferior to the newcomers and unable to compete for limited resources			2
but more recent evidence has shown that @entity3 made effective tools and weapons , wore ornaments such as eagle claws , used ochre and pitch , ate plants and fish as well as big game and created organised living spaces in their caves			2
in many cases this was happening before the arrival of modern humans , so the behaviours could not have been copied from them			0
reviewing the evidence , the scientists pointed out that 200,000 years ago @entity3 were using fire to produce pitch from tree bark			1
experiments showed that the process required high temperatures and an oxygen - free environment such as an enclosed pot , suggesting a high level of technical knowledge			0
evidence of the @entity3 and early humans mixing can be seen in the fossil record			1
some human - like characteristics have been found in late @entity3 fossils , and conversely , @entity3 features have been seen in early specimens of modern humans in @entity50 neanderthal dna , which was sequenced in 2010 , shows clear evidence of interbreeding , the researchers add			1
neanderthals and early modern humans are most likely to have interbred in @entity50 and the @entity98 around 50,000 years ago			1
today @entity3 inheritance is estimated to make up between 1 % and 4 % of the dna of people outside @entity102			2
@entity103 could be one reason why @entity3 vanished , according to the scientists			1
they were not so much driven to extinction as assimilated			0
evidence of the two mixing can be seen in the fossil record			0
some human - like characteristics have been found in late @entity3 fossils , and conversely , @entity3 features have been seen in early specimens of modern humans in @entity50			1
neanderthals were more robust and much stronger than modern humans , with a backward sloping chin and forehead			0
it is possible that interbreeding with @entity3 may have helped our ancestors survive outside @entity102 , say the scientists			0
on the other hand some @entity3 genes may have contributed to sterility , which is why so few remain			0
the researchers wrote : ' the @entity3 demise appears to have resulted from a complex and protracted process including multiple dynamic factors such as low population density , interbreeding with some cultural contact , possible male hybrid sterility and contraction in geographic distribution followed by genetic swamping and assimilation by the increasing numbers of modern immigrants			2
' @entity50 may be closer to their @entity3 cousins than previously thought , new research suggests			0
breeding with @entity3 has long been known to have left its traces in the dna of modern @entity50			0
scientists in @entity144 have now confirmed that the genetic similarity between the two must have arisen after interbreeding in @entity50 and @entity147 , before our ancestors spread across the globe			0
previous research speculated that modern @entity50 and @entity151 are related to @entity3 because they originated from a similar sub-population in @entity102			0
both groups evolved from a common ancestor in @entity102 before spreading to other parts of the world			0
the two groups emerged at different times with @entity3 leaving the @entity102 continent more than 200,000 years before humans did			1
now scientists at the @entity162 and @entity163 found the species mated in @entity50 and @entity147 thousands of years ago			1
the research involved dividing up the genetic code of each sub-species to calculate the statistical likelihood of distant or recent interbreeding			0
they traced the biological ties that exist between humans and the ancient species which are believed to have died out around 30,000 years ago			1
the research found that the two per cent of neanderthal dna which exists in people today came from the mating outside of @entity102 .			0

two researchers have suggested that @entity3 never went extinct
instead , they say they vanished because they mated with early humans
they also say @entity3 were not as dumb as we believed them to be
their lack of intelligence is often cited as the reason they disappeared
they thrived in @entity48 for 300,000 years but vanished 40,000 years ago
