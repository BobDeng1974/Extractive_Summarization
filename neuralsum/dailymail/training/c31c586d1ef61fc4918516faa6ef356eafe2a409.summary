by @entity0 published : 13:13 est , 5 october 2012 updated : 13:19 est , 5 october 2012 she is the reality tv star and daughter of @entity4 tycoon sir @entity3 who has branched out in a design career of her own			0
and now @entity8 's rise to fame as fashion designer is heading for new heights with a promising new collection for autumn / winter 2012			1
@entity8 , 21 , has expanded her range , which was previously only heels , to feature scarves , fashion - forward jewellery , flat shoes and boots			1
those heels are still sky high though ... speaking at the launch of the collection last night , she said : ' [ it ] introduces a rocky edge , mixing up textures of mesh panelling and intricate laser cutwork			2
' @entity28 at the press launch of her new @entity31 collection for @entity32 's and www.topshop.com at @entity33 last night ' the 15 - piece collection sees the introduction of the signature charm print etched onto the jade green soles			1
' in addition the range has been extended to jewellery with coordinating designs , contrasting delicate chains with leather , spikes and tough utility pieces			1
' a twist on the signature @entity48 red sole ( and a reference to her famous surname ) , the bottom of @entity3 's are all a shade of green			0
while in previous seasons @entity3 's heels have been pointy stilettos , this season she 's gone for a more trend - focused chunky version for @entity31 , all of which feature a pretty botanical graphic on the soles			2
at the launch last night , to which various members of the press were invited , @entity8 wore a black lace maxi dress with studded leather sleeveless biker jacket - and chunky biker boots from her own collection			1
unlike her usual star - studded launches this was a low - key event with neither her famous father nor celebrities in attendance			0
@entity75 is available exclusively on www.topshop.com and in @entity76 's , with prices ranging from £ 75 to £ 195 for shoes and boots , £ 75 for scarves and £ 25 to £ 60 for jewellery			1
@entity83 's cjg collection for @entity31 shadow bolt boot , £ 165 @entity86 wing shoe , £ 130 dusk shadow boot , £ 165 black lily boot , £ 150 stud venom shoe , £ 130 @entity91 maze shoe , £ 165 @entity93 night boots , £ 195 midnight frost boots , £ 185 @entity28 seen here modelling her new bracelets , £ 38 each , £ 75 scarf and £ 130 @entity98 lace shoes the designs of the shoes are at once pretty and urban , which is a good place for @entity8 to be			1
the collection as a whole seems to be more perceptive of her target market of girls in their late teens			0
a far cry from the glittering , metallic and neon creations in her first collection , these more sophisticated designs are refreshing			0
the heights of some of the platform heels we love are still eye - watering though , to the point of wondering how dangerous it is to walk in them , which is a shame			0
the scarves are feminine yet edgy with great screen prints and lovely muted colours that would go well in any pretty goth 's closet			2
the jewellery is also outstanding			0
we love the spiked cuff bracelet and the collar - like necklaces - both of which would complement a lot of what 's already in our wardrobe			2
verdict : she 's on the right track .			0

@entity142 / winter 12 collection is @entity8 's second - and fashion *critics* called the latest line ' *mature* '
@entity8 , 21 , has expanded beyond shoe range to *include* scarves and jewellery
