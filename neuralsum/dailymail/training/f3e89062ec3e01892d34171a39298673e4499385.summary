labour sources confirmed that mr @entity1 had personally appointed flowers to his elite @entity34 in 2010 — and even invited him for private talks in his commons office last year			1
it also emerged that @entity13 described shadow chancellor @entity39 as a ‘ political friend ’ and boasted of helping to arrange a £ 50,000 donation for him from the co-op last year			1
both mr @entity1 and mr @entity39 deny being close to @entity13 , who was suspended by @entity10 last night for ‘ bringing the party into disrepute			1
’ a spokesman for mr @entity39 , one of 32 @entity47 sponsored by the co-op , said he had never held a meeting with @entity26 and never discussed the donation with him			0
the near - collapse of the @entity6 is embarrassing for @entity10 , which has long ties with the organisation			0
last year mr @entity1 hailed the firm as the future of banking in a speech at the its headquarters			2
and many mps receive financial support from the co-op , including shadow treasury chief secretary @entity61 , shadow @entity64 minister @entity63 and shadow constitutional reform minister @entity66			2
@entity10 ’s @entity67 was set up by mr @entity1 to provide him with personal advice on business policy			2
caught on camera : the @entity71 was filmed counting money for drugs having parked up , @entity13 counts out £ 300 in £ 20 notes before handing the cash over for a drugs deal the video and a series of damning text messages were handed to @entity80 by acquaintance @entity81 , who was ' disgusted by his hypocrisy ' @entity13 was one of 20 members of the group , which held meetings in 2011 and 2012			1
it has now been superseded by other @entity10 business @entity87 about the appointment yesterday , mr @entity1 said : ‘ he was involved in the co-op and that is no longer the case			2
i think we will leave it there			0
you appoint people from a whole range of backgrounds to look at a whole range of issues and we have a range of business people working with us			0
‘ the police are looking into the matter and i ’m not going to comment on an ongoing investigation			0
suffice to say that group no longer exists			0
we should let the police inquiry take its course			0
’ @entity10 was last night unable to shed light on the meeting mr @entity1 held with flowers at the @entity113 in march last year , describing it as a ‘ private meeting ’			1
but sources said it should come as ‘ no surprise ’ that the chairman of the @entity6 , which has historic ties to @entity10 , would be asked for advice on issues such as banking reform			0
in evidence to mps earlier this month , @entity13 said mr @entity39 had played a pivotal role in supporting legislation that enabled the @entity6 ’s disastrous 2009 merger with the @entity128			1
the co-op gave @entity10 £ 750,000 in donations in 2009 , the year the @entity128 merger went through			0
@entity10 also benefits from a £ 1.3 million loan from the cash - strapped @entity134 op. a spokesman for mr @entity39 , who was the keynote speaker at the @entity138 ’s gala dinner this year , insisted he had few dealings with @entity13			2
he said : ‘ @entity1 ’s been to a few events which @entity13 has also been at , but he ’s never had a meeting or phone conversation with him			1
' @entity143 donated £ 50,000 to the shadow chancellor ’s office , which was declared in the normal way			0
@entity1 has never discussed the donation with @entity13			1
’ flowers became the first former co-op boss to reveal the enthusiasm of mr @entity39 for the disastrous 2009 merger with @entity128 , which helped bring the lender to its knees			0
while he denied political interference , he said : ‘ @entity39 was particularly supportive of us – talking to us and encouraging us			0
’ @entity13 said mr @entity39 was not at the @entity155 at the time but was the schools minister			1
a @entity158 also heard mr @entity39 has a close relationship with the bank ’s parent , the @entity143 , which gave his office £ 50,000 in donations last year .			0
