in april @entity8 reported that its first - quarter profit dropped 53 percent , pulled down by costs tied to an acquisition and lower sales for @entity7 and @entity41			1
the problem faced by toymakers is that children as young as three are taking more of an interest in the latest gadgets and therefore spending less time with toys			1
the interest is fuelled by the likelihood that many can expect to get their hands on their parents ' older @entity1 and @entity55 models as they upgrade this @entity13			2
as their parents look to upgrade to the next @entity1 or @entity55 this year , their children are expected to benefit from the hand @entity8 faced financial difficulty in the 1980s when it attempted to move into the video games market , while @entity15 , the maker of @entity61 and @entity62 have suffered fierce competition from the social gaming company @entity65 , built of @entity66			1

it sold 40million across the world at the height of its popularity in the 1990s and the new version , with @entity85 eyes and costing £ 59.99 , now has @entity85 eyes has sold 20 per cent above expectations			0
a @entity15 spokesman said : ' the response to the new innovation on @entity75 has been terrific in marketsaround the world			1
' in the @entity93 , we not only delivered 20 per cent more product than we had initially planned , but we also flew some additional @entity75 into the country to try and meet demand			0
we are ramping up production			0
' the @entity98 refuted the claim that traditional presents are in decline , and said that toys popular in the 1980s are on this year 's list of ' must - have ' presents			0
@entity105 sold in their millions after they were first launched in 1983			0
the dolls , which cost £ 29.99 , are supposedly found in vegetable patches and adopted by children			2
twister , the classic game which was hugely popular in the 1970s and 80s , is expected to sell well this year too , in a modern form called @entity111 and priced at £ 26.99			0

@entity128 , an industry analyst , said : ' there are a lot of toys that have re-launched this year as they have a long lifespan and are nostalgic to parents			0
' but the list , compiled by the @entity98 , is n't entirely nostalgic			0
