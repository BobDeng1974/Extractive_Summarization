by @entity1 reporter published : 11:02 est , 10 july 2013 updated : 07:10 est , 11 july 2013 a mother - of - three has survived deadly meningitis three times after the bug infiltrated her brain via a hole in her skull			1
@entity9 , now 39 , was first struck down with meningitis when she was five and then went to catch different strains when she was 33 and then 37 , just weeks before her wedding day			1
it was not until the third bout that doctors discovered the hole in her skull , next to her sinuses , that was exposing her brain to the bacterial and viral infections			1
@entity9 , 39 , ( pictured on her wedding day in 2011 ) has survived meningitis three times			1
she married shortly after her third encounter with the deadly condition which left her temporarily unable to walk			2
three months after her wedding she underwent surgery to close the hole in her skull that was making her prone to the infection mrs @entity9 caught the meningococcus strain of the bug when she was five - years - old			1
she responded well to treatment and made a full recovery			1
she then enjoyed good health - apart from frequent colds and flu - until october 2007 , when she was rushed to hospital again			2
mrs @entity9 , then 33 , was diagnosed with meningitis again but this time it was the pneumococcal strain			1
she said : ' i thought i ’d been unlucky to get it the first time so i could n’t believe it when they said i had it again			0
' after spending two weeks in hospital on strong antibiotics , she was finally allowed home			0
tests showed @entity9 had a weak immune system and doctors believed that she had probably contracted meningitis a second time because of this			1
she was given a series of injections to help boost her immune system			0
but in 2011 - and just weeks before she was due to marry her partner @entity53 , 34 - she was struck down with the same strain of the bug again			1
@entity9 ( pictured with husband @entity53 on their honeymoon ) was born with a small hole in her skull which opportunistic bacteria used as a gateway to her brain			1
when she caught meningitis for the third time , paramedics said her temperature was so high that ' she was cooking inside ' @entity9 , who works in a chip shop , said : ' i developed what i thought was a migraine and took myself to bed only to wake at 6am with the worst pains in my head i ’d ever experienced			1
' by the time the ambulance arrived , i was fitting and lashing out			0
the paramedics could n’t do anything with me			0
' i ’d become violent as well because of the temperature and i was n’t responding to the medication they were giving me			0
' they then rang for a doctor to come from the hospital to sedate me so they could get me out of the house			0
' paramedics told her worried daughter , @entity88 - @entity86 , 19 , that her mother ’s temperature was so high , she was ‘ cooking from the inside out			2
’ at hospital , doctors kept her in a darkened room and ran brain scans			2
initially , they thought @entity9 had suffered a brain haemorrhage but a lumbar puncture revealed she actually had pneumococcal meningitis			1
ms @entity9 's eye became paralysed shut as the infection took hold			2
initially , doctors thought @entity9 had suffered a brain haemorrhage but a lumbar puncture revealed she actually had meningitis for a third time ms @entity9 said she lokoed as if she had suffered a stroke			1
when she woke from her coma , she could not talk , walk or feed herself mrs @entity9 was immediately given intravenous antibiotics to fight the infection and spent eight days in a coma in intensive care while doctors battled to save her			1
when she woke up , she could n’t talk , walk or feed herself			0
she said : ' all my left side seemed to be worse and my left eye would n’t open			0
i looked like i ’d had a stroke			0
' all i wanted to do was go home as i was due to get married in ten weeks			2
we ’d cancelled the wedding once already back in 2009			0
' i told @entity53 to call it off but he , @entity123 and my gran persuaded me to change my mind			2
' it was something to work towards			0
i was determined to get myself better			0
everything was organised and paid for			0
' brain scans showed that mrs @entity9 had a very small hole in her skull ( right ) which had made her brain prone to infection			1
during surgery to fix the hole they then discovered that a small amount of brain had grown through the skull which had had to be removed it was at this point that doctors discovered @entity9 had a hole in her skull , just behind her sinuses			1
they believed that this had exposed her brain to both the bacterial and viral forms of meningitis			2
to close the hole in mrs @entity9 's head , surgeons removed bone from her leg ( pictured after doctors extracted a small amount of bone ) and grafted it onto the skull after three weeks in hospital , mrs @entity9 was discharged and with the help of physiotherapy she took her first steps			1
she was referred to a specialist who told her she needed an operation to fill the hole to reduce the risk of her contracting meningitis again - and they could use bone from her leg to do it			1
@entity9 decided to go ahead with the wedding and doctors agreed to postpone theoperation			1
she said : ' it was a lovely day especially considering i nearly did n’t make it			0
it was emotional for me but i think even more so for @entity53 and my family as they were the ones who had to see me so ill. ' a month later , @entity9 went into hospital for the operation			1
surgeons were left stunned when what they initially thought might be a polyp , an abnormal growth , in her left nostril was actually piece of her brain that had grown through the hole			1
@entity9 said : ' it had grown through the hole and died so they cut it out			2
i could n’t quite believe it when they told me			0
having a defect in the skull which exposes the brain to infection is not unheard off , according to specialist research and education manager @entity199 of the @entity201			2
she said : ' a group of pneumococcal bacteria that cause minor infections are very opportunistic and have been known , on rare occasions , to use a small hole in the skull as a gateway to the brain			1
' mrs @entity9 was in hospital for five days and was then released with dressings packed into my nose to keep the bone graft in place			2
' a week later , doctors confirmed the operation had been a success			0
@entity9 said : ' it was such a relief			2
' i was n’t well enough to go on the honeymoon so we had to postpone			0
we ’ve just got back home			0
we went to @entity222 and it was well worth the wait			0
' i ’m so lucky because things could have been very different			0
i ’m lucky to be alive			0
