@entity0 has admitted to being ' racist ' following comments he made about actor @entity3			2
the eternally outspoken host decided to address news out of the @entity7 hack that @entity3 was being eyed to play @entity8 once @entity9 exited the franchise , declaring it unacceptable for a black actor to even be considered for the iconic role of 007			1
he then took it a step further by saying the idea of casting @entity3 as @entity8 , a fictional storybook spy created by author @entity18 , was as ridiculous as a white actor playing a black historical figure			1
he was white and @entity29			0
that is who @entity8 is , was , ' said @entity0 as he began his diatribe			0
' but now [ they are ] suggesting that the next @entity8 should be @entity3 , a black @entity34 , rather than a white from @entity29			1
' hear more on @entity36 the polarizing pundit then acknowledged that he was being racist , seemingly unfazed by the realization , adding ; ' that ’s not who @entity8 is and i know it ’s racist to probably point this out			2
' @entity0 did not reveal however how he feels about @entity9 playing @entity8 , or make mention of actors @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 or @entity50 , who , while white , are not @entity29			2
in fact , of the seven men to have played the smooth - talking spy over the past 50 years , only one is actually @entity29 - the very first @entity8 , @entity55			0
despite these inarguable facts , @entity0 still declared at one point during the show ; ' fifty years of white @entity8 because @entity8 is white			0
' things then got taken a step further when @entity0 said that casting @entity3 , whose phonetical name proved challenging for @entity0 to pronounce throughout the segment , as @entity8 would be like casting @entity65 as president @entity66 or @entity67 as @entity68			1
it did n't stop there either , with @entity0 imagining @entity71 playing @entity66 and @entity72 as @entity73 as scenarios as ludicrous as a black man playing @entity8 , before capping it all off by suggesting @entity78 actor @entity77 playing the role of gay footballer @entity80 is akin to @entity3 as @entity8			1
@entity0 then declared ' we ’re just playing here , ' before moving on to his next talking point			0
it is also worth noting that the self - described @entity8 fanatic @entity0 's claim that 007 ' always drank vodka ' is also not accurate , as the spy drinks a variety of different beverages in @entity91 's novels .			0

@entity0 declared that a black man could not *portray* @entity8 during his radio show on tuesday
this in *response* to leaked *emails* obtained by hackers that showed @entity7 executives were looking to cast @entity3 as the next @entity8
@entity0 also said that the man who plays @entity8 has to be white and @entity29 , despite the fact that @entity55 is the only @entity104 to play @entity8
the polarizing pundit also acknowledged the fact that he was being ' racist ' during his rant
the segment capped off with @entity0 *comparing* @entity3 's casting to @entity65 playing president @entity66 and @entity71 as @entity66
