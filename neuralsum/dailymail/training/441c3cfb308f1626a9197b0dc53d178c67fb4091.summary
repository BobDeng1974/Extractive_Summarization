an advert for a popular brand of pantyliners has sparked outrage after viewers complained it contained language they deemed offensive			0
the 30 second television commercial by @entity9 brand @entity7 dispenses with the customary euphemisms and sanitised suggestions at bodily functions			1
instead , the actress in the advert talks openly about the woman 's monthly cycle - mentioning the words ' vagina ' and ' discharge '			2
@entity20 : @entity9 say their decision to use the words ' vagina ' and ' discharge ' was very conscious			1
' we wanted to take a bold approach ' the actress in the commercial , naked but for a scattering of flower petals to protect her modesty , says to the camera that ' even that bit of discharge in between our period is our body working to keep the vagina healthy			2
' she goes on to say that @entity7 pads ' lock away wetness and odour , helping you to feel dry , clean and fresh every day			2
' such references may seem entirely innocuous to most			0
but after the advert , created by ad firm @entity50 , aired for the first time on monday night in @entity52 , the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) received nine complaints , with viewers objecting particularly to the words ' vagina ' and ' discharge '			1
offence : some viewers were uncomfortable with the language used , and nine made complaints to the @entity47 the advert , which carries a @entity65 rating , meaning it can be shown at any time except for during programmes that specifically target children under the age of 13 , has been given the green light by the advertising standards authority			0
@entity7 spokesman @entity71 told @entity72 that the company made a very conscious decision to use frank language			2
' it 's the first time a major brand has had the guts to use real words , not euphemisms or diminutive terms , ' @entity71 told @entity82			0
@entity52 media blog @entity83 reported that parent company @entity9 created the @entity7 ad in response to a study that showed women would welcome a more honest conversation about their bodies , and revealed that 71 percent of @entity92 women admit to experiencing discharge while 66 percent are bothered by it			1
@entity95 of @entity96 , the company that owns @entity7 , said : ' we have decided to take a bold approach in this campaign with the aim to tackle a subject which as always been taboo			0
' we want to encourage women to talk openly about their bodies , educating them both on discharge and the benefits of using @entity7 act - fresh liners on a daily basis			1
