@entity0 is in the midst of the most testing few weeks of his managerial career , but the @entity4 head coach is enjoying every second of it			1
over a 17 - day period , the @entity7 faces the unenviable task of ensuring @entity4 continue their top - four charge and a two - pronged attack on silverware			1
taking on @entity12 for a place in the last 16 of the @entity14 is tough enough , but that two - legged tie comes in a frantic period which includes three @entity18 matches and , most importantly , a shot at silverware			1
@entity21 celebrates scoring with the last kick of the game as @entity4 fought back against @entity24 @entity21 's penalty was saved by @entity26 but the striker followed up to score the rebound @entity4 1 - 1 @entity12 - feb 19 @entity4 2 - 2 @entity24 - feb 22 @entity12 vs @entity4 - feb 26 @entity29 vs @entity4 - mar 1 @entity4 vs @entity30 - mar 4 @entity31 vs @entity4 - mar 7 on sunday , @entity0 will lead his players out at @entity33 to take on @entity29 in the @entity35 final , with victory offering a wonderful way to cap an already impressive first season at the helm			1
as a former @entity42 international with experience playing in the top level in @entity46 and @entity47 , it is a high pressure the @entity4 boss is used to and a situation he thrives off			2
' yes , maybe ( this is the biggest challenge i have faced as a manager ) , ' @entity0 said			1
' i think that it is a good challenge for us , for me personally , but i feel good			0
i am prepared to enjoy these moments			0
' we have ahead a lot of very tough games and one final			2
i think it is good for the club , good for our supporters and for our players , too			2
@entity0 admits the next run of games is the biggest challenge of his managerial career @entity67 strikes to pull one back for @entity4 with 10 minutes remaining in the match in north @entity70 ' but i do n't think too much			1
it is only to enjoy moments and try to prepare them in the best way for their next game			0
' always in football , you need to enjoy			0
if not , it is difficult to give your best			0
' football is emotion - you need to be in your best condition to play in your best level			0
' as well as being mentally ready , the importance of being physically prepared can not be underestimated			0
spurs have struggled in the league immediately following @entity14 matches even when rotating the squad , underlined by sunday 's 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity24			1
that inability to balance domestic and @entity92 exertions has proved costly this season and could haunt them again at @entity33 , with the showdown against @entity29 coming just three days after taking on @entity12 in @entity96			2
@entity97 , left , opened the scoring for @entity4 in the first leg against @entity12 @entity100 stabbed the ball home to give the visitors a vital away goal to take back to @entity105 ' i think in the last period we 've played a lot of games and i think now we are prepared to compete on thursday and sunday , ' @entity0 said			1
' i think we have improved a lot and changed the competition because it 's all in our mind			0
it 's because our physical condition is good , it 's excellent			0
' but i think in the seven months we 've been here we 've improved a lot and we 're not worried about that			0
the team is ready to compete on thursday and sunday			0
' @entity0 may have been working for the players for seven months , but it is nine since he accepted a five - year contract at @entity122			2
upon his appointment , the @entity7 pledged ' to give the supporters the kind of attacking football and success ' they yearn for			2
@entity4 fans have certainly seen a number of exciting glimpses of that so far , highlighted by the astonishing 5 - 3 @entity133 annihilation of @entity29			1
@entity0 is under no illusion about the difficulty in replicating that result - never mind scoreline - but it is a challenge @entity4 fans will be hopeful their manager can rise to .			1

@entity4 are facing a *fixture* pile - up over the next three weeks
spurs face @entity12 in the second leg of @entity14 last - *23*
club then take on @entity29 in next sunday 's @entity35 final
before returning to @entity18 action as they continue top - four chase
