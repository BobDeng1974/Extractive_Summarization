by @entity0 plans : @entity2 , the party 's election co-ordinator , said the current system was ' simply not working ' @entity5 will pledge in its next manifesto to scrap £ 9,000 - a - year tuition fees and introduce a new system with lower charges			1
@entity2 , the party ’s election co-ordinator , said the current system was ‘ simply not working ’ and would be axed under a @entity5 government			1
party leader @entity12 unveiled plans to cut student fees to £ 6,000 - a - year in his speech to the 2011 party conference but stopped short of making it a manifesto pledge			1
now mr @entity2 , also the shadow foreign secretary , has disclosed that tuition fees policy will be ‘ addressed ’ in the party ’s next manifesto			0
plans being considered would reduce the maximum fee to £ 6,000 - a - year through taxes on banks and the wealthiest graduates paying a higher interest rate on their student loans			1
a more radical proposal put forward by @entity29 , a universities minister in the last government , would reduce fees further , to £ 4,000 - a - year			1
a third option would involve scrapping tuition fees altogether and replacing them with a graduate tax			0
the @entity35 claimed that cutting fees would leave @entity5 with a huge university funding ‘ black hole ’			1
@entity5 ’s plans emerged amid a growing row over the cost to the public purse of the system of £ 9,000 - a - year fees and loans introduced by the @entity46 in 2012			1
ministers originally believed that only 28 per cent of student loans would never be repaid but new calculations put the figure at 45 per cent			0
experts say that when the figure reaches 48 per cent , the new system will cost taxpayers more than the one it replaced			0
questioned about tuition fees on @entity58 ’s @entity57 , mr @entity2 said : ‘ this seems to be another con / @entity61 policy that simply is not working			2
the rate of default emerged this week and it ’s very high			0
‘ @entity12 has gone on the record in the past in saying this is a policy that we are looking at			0
i expect it is a policy that we will address in our manifesto and i hope that we are able to offer a better solution to the students of this country and to the finances of this country than that which we have seen from the conservatives			0
’ plans : @entity12 outlined proposals to scrap the current system during the @entity5 conference in 2011 while higher education spokesman @entity85 has also backed reform asked if @entity5 could simply get rid of the fees , he said : ‘ we are dealing with this as part of our policy review process , i expect it ’s an issue we will address in our manifesto but it ’s very clear that even on the government ’s own evidence this is not a policy that ’s working			1
’ defence : universities minister @entity97 said : ' a graduate repayment system is the only sustainable way of financing higher education ' one plan expected to put forward by mr @entity29 this week would see students given an ‘ entitlement ’ of £ 15,000 they could take to any university - or £ 5,000 - a - year for a typical three - year degree			1
universities would be able to charge more - up to around £ 4,000 - a - year - if the costs of teaching exceeded the value of the entitlement			2
meanwhile @entity85 , @entity5 ’s higher education spokesman , has revealed the party is considering reform in two stages - first a cut to fees and then a graduate tax			2
‘ what we ’ll have to do in our manifesto is take our starting point of £ 6k fees , explain how we see the situation for 2015 to 2020 , and how we ’ll see a long - term shift to a graduate tax , ’ he said in a recent interview			0
defending the current system , universities minister @entity97 said : ‘ a graduate repayment system is the only sustainable way of financing higher education			2
‘ the question for @entity5 is that if they want to cut fees by £ 3,000 they will have a black hole of £ 3billion			1
’ the @entity80 are reportedly considering a range of measures to reduce the student loans bill including stripping some lower - ranked universities of their right to charge tuition fees if drop - out rates from courses are too high or graduates struggle to find graduate - level jobs			0
but elite universities would be able to raise fees above £ 9,000 - a - year if they could show that their courses led to high - earning jobs which would allow student loans to be paid back in full			2
a further proposal reportedly being considered by the @entity152 would involve imposing a minimum qualification for students to go to university , reducing the numbers in the system .			0
