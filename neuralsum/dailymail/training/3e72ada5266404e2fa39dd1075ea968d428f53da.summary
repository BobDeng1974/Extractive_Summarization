it has often been said that one of the reasons we are yet to find life elsewhere in the universe is that it is rare ; most think the development of life on @entity9 was a fluke			2
but one of the most prominent young physicists in the world has claimed otherwise , saying that he thinks life is as inevitable as inorganic matter			1
the bold new theory suggests that atoms , when subjected to energy , will always form some form of life - and it may mean we are part of a universe teeming with other organisms			1
a @entity26 scientist says life in the universe ( stock image shown ) may be common			1
dr @entity31 's theory suggests atoms will always pick an organic path			1
this is because they are choosing the path that requires least energy - and life is more efficient than inorganic matter the theory has been presented by 31 - year - old physicist dr @entity31 from the @entity26			1
he is regarded as one of the most promising up and coming scientists in biology ; a few years ago he was named in the @entity43 of science list			0
and now in a series of talks he has been giving to various universities , he says the origin of life ‘ should be as unsurprising as rocks rolling downhill , ’ reported @entity51			1
he has recently published a paper further explaining the research along with two of his colleagues			0
dr @entity57 , an associate professor in @entity58 at the @entity59 , said earlier this month that the first life we find in the universe might be a form of artificial intelligence - and it could indicate that humans , too , will one day be more machine than man			1
speaking to @entity68 , she said : ‘ if you look at our own civilisation , people are becoming more immersed in computers , and we can already see signs of it in our own culture			2
‘ so it looks like the next evolutionary step could be we are post-biological , we are sort of part computer in that people decide to “ upload ” themselves			0
‘ it sounds kind of crazy , and i do n’t approve of this as a philosopher , but i think the thing is that that ’s sort of the pattern a lot of people are starting to notice			0
‘ @entity89 will be vastly older than us , so it looks like they may be sophisticated forms of @entity92 that are far smarter than we are			0
' dr @entity94 ’s idea is based around entropy ; namely , energy spreads out or dissipates over time			1
for example , a cup of coffee left in a room will eventually reach the same temperature as the room itself			0
energy will always seek the path of least resistance if left to its own devices , which is why things in the universe - including the universe itself - tend to ‘ spread out ' , also known as an increase in entropy			1
based on this , dr @entity94 suggests that when atoms are supplied with energy , in certain conditions they will always eventually give rise to life			1
‘ you start with a random clump of atoms , and if you shine light on it for long enough , it should not be so surprising that you get a plant , ’ he said			2
the reason for this , and the underlying aspect of his theory , is that while all matter - from rocks to plants - absorbs and dissipates energy , life is much better at redistributing it			1
this means that , taking the coffee cup example but this time using molecules swimming in an ocean , the atoms will reorganise themselves into life because it is better at dissipating the energy in the water			2
dr @entity94 's theory implies that as energy spreads out - entropy - life is inevitable			1
atoms in a primordial ocean ( illustrated ) , for example , should ultimately form into organic matter if supplied with energy			1
the origin of life ' should be as unsurprising as rocks rolling downhill , ' he said dr @entity94 stressed that his theory is not meant to counter @entity153 ’s theory of evolution , natural selection , but rather compliment it			1
‘ the reason that an organism shows characteristic @entity159 rather than @entity160 may not be because @entity159 is more fit than @entity160 , but because physical constraints make it easier for x to evolve than for @entity160 to evolve , ’ he said			0
and in his latest research he said he has carried out a study , with his colleagues , that shows the theory could well be true			0
‘ we are [ ... ] spurred on by the intriguing possibility that life - like behavior in nonequilibrium systems may turn out to be surprisingly common , now that we have begun learning how to look for its physical signatures , ' they wrote			2
if true , the implications of dr @entity94 ’s theories are vast			1
perhaps most importantly , it may suggest life elsewhere in the universe is not as rare as once thought , but rather is as common as planets and stars themselves			2
while many think that life in the universe is rare , it may instead be that we are just a tiny speck in the amount of life in the universe			0
in the last few decades hundreds of exoplanets have been discovered ( illustration shown ) , although we are yet to find one that could truly be classed as ' habitable ' like @entity9 speaking to @entity68 , dr @entity195 , director of the centre for @entity196 , said : ‘ one of the outstanding problems in science these days is the origin of life			1
the @entity202 questions why have we not found aliens , despite the existence of hundreds of billions of exosolar systems in our galactic neighborhood in which life might evolve			0
physicist @entity209 devised it in 1950			0
he believed it was too extraordinary that not a single extraterrestrial signal or engineering project has yet been detected			0
he claimed there must be some kind of barrier that prevents the rise of intelligent , self - aware , technologically advanced , space - colonising civilisations			0
we can think of this barrier as a ‘ @entity222 ’			0
the absence could be caused because either intelligent life is extremely rare or intelligent life has a tendency to go extinct			0
‘ we know that @entity9 has been [ host to life ] for close to four billion years , but what we do n’t know is how that first self - reproducing bit of chemistry got started			2
’ he explained that if getting life started required very special conditions , then it would ‘ imply that we do n’t have much company in the cosmos			0
’ he continued : ' if dr @entity94 is correct - that biology is virtually a certain consequence of self - organising principles that would apply on any world - then we are most certainly not alone			1
' remember that @entity242 , the famous @entity243 cosmologist , once opined that the probability that the random mixing of molecules in the primordial oceans of @entity9 would eventually produce dna or @entity249 was about the same as the chance that a tornado , tearing through a junkyard , would assemble a @entity253			0
‘ in that view , life would be extraordinarily special and rare			0
dr. @entity94 suggests , however , that nothing could be farther from the truth			2

@entity26 scientist says life may be common
dr @entity31 's theory suggests atoms always pick organic path
this is because they are choosing the path that requires least energy - and life is more efficient than inorganic matter
it implies that as energy spreads out - entropy - life is inevitable
origin of life ' is as unsurprising as rocks rolling downhill , ' said dr @entity94
' if dr @entity94 is correct then we are most certainly not alone , ' dr @entity195 , director of the centre for @entity196 , told @entity68
