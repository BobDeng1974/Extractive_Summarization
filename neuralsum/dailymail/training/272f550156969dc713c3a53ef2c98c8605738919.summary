he was on duty when the first plane , @entity55 , crashed into the building at 8.46am on september 11			0
the impact hit the structure between the 94th and 98th floors and within seconds , flames and smoke engulfed the complex , trapping those on the floors above			0
90 minutes later the tower collapsed			0

@entity34 was working at the restaurant on september 11 at the end of the process , $ 7 billion was awarded to 97 per cent of the families - with the average payout to individuals being $ 1.8 million			1

@entity73 , special master for the september 11 victim 's compensation fund , was charged with allocating money for families of the victims ' she would have technically been entitled to the whole thing , even though the marriage was a sham , ' said @entity105 , who was @entity11 's lawyer in the matter			1
' at the time , i thought it was a decent deal			0
' the siblings received a total of $ 150,000 , after legal fees , @entity11 said			2

the money was n't distributed properly			2
' though he seems to have exhausted all his legal options now , @entity11 wants to expose his stepmother as a fraud			0
‘ money is really secondary , ’ he said			2
‘ but there ’s real family that exists			0
what makes me mad is the person that took the money is claiming she ’s family			2
’ a friend who had known the couple during their short union said that the groom entered into the marriage on a ' 50/50 ' basis – half to help his legal status in the @entity20 and half because of his fondness for @entity19			1
' it was both , ' @entity123 said			0
' it was business , and he liked her , too			0
' @entity19 herself even seemed to have doubts that love was the motivation for the marriage			2
wedded bliss ? @entity19 moved into this @entity33 home belonging to @entity13 in june 2001 , months before his death on september 11 ' i ca n't tell if that was @entity169 's original intention , ' she told the @entity22 , when asked if it was indeed just a green card marriage			1

we started living the @entity174 life			0
then he died , ' she added			2
@entity19 maintains that she is in the clear and blames her stepson for not moving on after the tragic loss			0
