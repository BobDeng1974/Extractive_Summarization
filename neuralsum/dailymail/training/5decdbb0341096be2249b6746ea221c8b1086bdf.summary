by @entity0 published : 11:01 est , 30 august 2013 updated : 12:45 est , 30 august 2013 he has stared death in the face and come out the other side to tell his story - so swallowing an amputated human toe should be child 's play			1
the man who paid $ 500 for the privilege of gulping down a pickled toe was today named as @entity11 , who is believed to be a @entity13 survivor from @entity14			1
reports emerged on wednesday about the incident , which took place at the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity20 , on saturday night			1
@entity11 decided to take on the area 's infamous @entity21 - wherein an amputated toe , which has been preserved and pickled , is dropped into a glass and for $ 5 the customer must drink the shot and have the toe touch their lips			1
but the lips have got ta touch the toe ' down in one : @entity32 tilts his head back to ensure the entire contents of the glass - toe and all - disappear saloon : the @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity44 , is famous for its @entity21 - a 40 - year tradition which has been done by more than 65,000 people but @entity11 went one step further and drank the toe down with his whiskey , then threw $ 500 on the table - the fine imposed by the saloon should anyone swallow it			1
the idea of the @entity21 started in september 1973 , when riverboat captain @entity56 found a severed big toe preserved in a pickle jar			1
captain @entity56 somehow got the idea of making a game with it and came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends - take a beer glass full of champagne , drop in the toe , tip the glass back … and the toe must touch the lips			1
in september 1973 , eight people participated in the first attempt ; nearly four decades later , the @entity75 has an estimated 100,000 - plus members			2
any liquor can be used in the cocktail , but the norm now is a shot of @entity82 whiskey			0
it costs just $ 5 and for that you sign a log book and get a certificate confirming you as a member of the @entity75			2
one rule must be adhered to however : ' you can drink it fast , you can drink it slow			0
but the lips have got ta touch the toe			1
' it has been described by members of the club as a ' leathery piece of jerky with a toe nail attached '			2
@entity11 was said to have been in @entity44 for the summer and had just got his rent deposit back			0
a video of the incident emerged today on @entity101 and shows the toe - curling moment the pinkie disappeared from the glass			2
@entity11 's eyes widen as it goes down his throat before he washes it down with another drink			0
he then stands up , raises his arms in the air in triumph and says , ' i did it , it 's down ' , before throwing $ 500 on the table to a visibly shocked @entity117 , the ' toe captain ' of the night			1
@entity117 said the latest toe was ' mummified ' with salt , and plonked into drinks for brave patrons about 30 to 40 times per night			2
speaking to @entity123 about what happened , he said : ' this guy popped it in his mouth , takes $ 500 out of his pocket and slams it on the table and starts walking away			0
' i said , " where ’s the toe ? " and he said , " i swallowed it "			2
' the fine has since been raised to $ 2,500			1
throughout the 40 - year tradition , more than 100,000 people have joined the @entity21 club			1
the @entity137 started in september 1973 when a local eccentric named captain @entity56 found a severed toe preserved in a jar			1
he came up with the original rules for the drink over the course of a drunken evening with friends : take a beer glass full of champagne , drop in the toe , tip the glass back			0
since then a number have been swallowed , lost or destroyed - eight in total - but fortunately for the bar , they always manage to find someone to donate a new toe			1
@entity117 said they have a backup toe but like to keep two at a time so are on the hunt looking for a new one			0
he told @entity161 : ' we like to have two toes - we switch them off once a week - and now we ca n't do that			0
we 're putting it out there , if you have a spare toe , hey we need one			0
' @entity32 remained in @entity14 during @entity13 and the collapse of the levees			2
he refused to leave the city at the dangerous and devastating time and tape - recorded impressionistic interviews with fellow storm survivors			0
from these interviews and his own diary entries , he penned @entity178 : surviving @entity13 and life in its @entity180 , which was a 2007 finalist for the @entity182			0
@entity183 : while it may sound unsanitary , the toes are pickled for months in medical alcohol and then packed in dry salts so pose no health risks to drinkers new member : a female customer prepares to take the @entity21 challenge so she can join the prestigious club down in one : the famous tradition is mentioned in guide books and people have come from far and wide to become members of the @entity75 @entity117 said they are now looking for more toes : ' we like to have two toes - we switch them off once a week - and now we ca n't do that			1
we 're putting it out there , if you have a spare toe , hey we need one ' captain @entity56 shows how it 's done : the now - 83 - year - old says the @entity21 is his greatest and proudest achievement the toe is believed to belong to @entity214 , a chain - link fence installer in @entity216 , who got his pinkie toe amputated in january 2000 after developing hammertoe			1
he kept it in a jar in his freezer and donated it in april 2002			0
manager at the @entity225 told the @entity226 last year : ' we 've had people throwing up , we 've had people gagging on their drinks			0
' @entity231 trouble is when someone gets overenthusiastic			0
you never know when some fool is going to do something stupid			0
and then we 'll be without a toe			0

the 40 - year tradition was started by captain @entity56 after he found a severed toe in a jar
those up for the challenge must make sure the toe touches their lips
@entity32 is the only person to have *deliberately* swallowed the toe
the fine for swallowing it has now gone up to $ 2,500
@entity18 are now searching for a new toe for the club
