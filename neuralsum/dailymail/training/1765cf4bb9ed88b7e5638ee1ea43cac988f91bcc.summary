by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:01 est , 21 may 2012 updated : 16:34 est , 22 may 2012 thousands of women over 40 could be eligible for fertility treatment on the @entity4 under new proposals published today			1
@entity6 is currently only recommended by the @entity7 for women aged 23 to 39 because the chances of success decline rapidly with age			1
however , @entity7 is now considering offering one full cycle of @entity6 to women aged 40 to 42 in draft guidelines which will now go to public consultation			1
women struggling to fall pregnant could soon be offered @entity6 up to the age of 42 on the @entity4 the health rationing body will also advise the health service to offer free ivf to gay and lesbian couples as long as they have tried - and failed - to have a baby at least six times using a private fertility clinics			1
its previous guidelines did not specifically state that such couples should not be offered treatment and all bar a few @entity4 trusts do so			1
each course or ' cycle ' of @entity6 costs the @entity4 about £ 3,000			1
@entity7 does not know how much its proposals are likely to cost the taxpayer every year			2
but the most recent figures for 2010 show that nearly 8,000 women aged 40 to 42 have @entity6 privately			1
if all these women had had their treatment on the @entity4 it would have cost £ 24million			1
dr @entity41 , deputy chief executive , @entity7 , said : ' infertility is a medical condition that can cause significant distress for those trying to have a baby			2
' this distress can have a real impact on people ’s lives , potentially leading to depression and the break - down of relationships			2
' however , in many cases infertility can be treated effectively – there are thousands of babies and happy parents thanks to @entity4 fertility treatment – which is why the @entity4 provides services and why @entity7 produces guidance on the topic			1
' she added that there had been many advances in both treatments and in the understanding of different fertility techniques since the last guidelines were published in 2004			0
' for this update we are using the latest statistical and clinical evidence to make sure that treatment for infertility is offered at a time and in a way which is most likely to result in pregnancy , ' she said			0
the new guidance would also mean that women aged under 39 would be eligible for three cycles of @entity6 after two years rather than having to wait for three under the current rules			1
they also appear to remove the lower age - barrier of 23 for treatment			0
however , there are concerns that many cash - strapped health trusts will ignore the guidelines			0
last year a report by @entity88 found that three quarters of health trusts were refusing to fund the recommended three courses for eligible couples			0
specific recommendations have also been put forward to limit the number of embryos implanted during treatment as multiple births create more risks for both mother and children			0
in 2004 it was recommended no more than two embryos should be transferred during a cycle			2
now @entity7 recommends single embryo transfer for women under 37 and in women under 39 if there is at least one top - quality embryo			2
dr @entity41 added : ' new groups of the population have also been included in this update			0
these groups include people who are preparing for cancer treatment who may wish to preserve their fertility , those who carry an infectious disease , such as @entity119 or @entity120 , same - sex couples and those who are unable to have intercourse , for example , if they have a physical disability			0
' the aim of these new and updated recommendations is to ensure that everyone who has problems with fertility has access to the best levels of help			0
we are now consulting on this draft guideline and we welcome comments from interested parties			0
' when published , the update will replace some but not all parts of the original fertility guideline			0
until then , @entity7 said @entity4 bodies should continue to follow the recommendations from the current guidelines .			2

nearly 8,000 women aged 40 to 42 had ivf privately in 2010 . each cycle costs £ 3,000 on the @entity4
