security chiefs have taken the dramatic step of withdrawing @entity2 from their high - profile posts outside palaces amid mounting fears of ‘ lone wolf ’ terrorist attacks			1
elite soldiers of the @entity9 have pulled back from public positions at many landmarks in response to possible threats from @entity15 extremists			1
for the first time since the height of the @entity20 ’s terror campaign , the soldiers are also no longer allowed on sentry duty alone , and are now accompanied by armed police			1
but the measures have been described as a ‘ retreat ’ for the guards , known the world over for their bearskin caps			1
retired officer major @entity45 of the @entity41 told @entity46 : ‘ i think this is a big shame			0
' the reason people know we ’re around is because they can see us			0
but i suppose the changes are necessary as there is a significant threat			0
’ this newspaper has confirmed the changes to the guards ’ security at sites including @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
for the first time since the height of the @entity20 ’s terror campaign , the soldiers are also no longer allowed on sentry duty alone , and are now accompanied by armed police at @entity60 , the official residence of @entity71 , the guardsmen who used to stand in front of the gates on @entity75 , a public road , have now been relocated , along with their sentry boxes , behind metal gates			1
tourists , who love to pose with the guards , can now barely see them			0
police officers confirmed changes had been made for security reasons			1
at @entity61 , the @entity85 home of @entity86 and @entity87 and @entity88 , two guardsmen used to perform sentry duties beneath its famous clock tower on @entity92			1
these guards and their sentry boxes have now been moved into a secluded courtyard inside the perimeter , leaving no visible presence at the clock tower gate			2
the measures have been described as a ‘ retreat ’ for the guards , known the world over for their bearskin caps in @entity63 , two sentries still stand guard where tourists can pose for photographs with them			1
but four armed police officers now guard the soldiers			1
the officers carry @entity112 carbine rifles , pistols and taser guns – in contrast to the guards , who just carry ceremonial swords			0
a metropolitan police officer on duty there told our reporter : ‘ yes , we are a recent addition here			1
it ’s us guarding the guards			0
i think there ’s a @entity130 phrase for that			0
’ at @entity62 , up to three armed officers now stand next to the lone sentry on guard duty on the @entity136 side of the castle			1
the tightening of security to levels unseen since the height of the @entity20 terror campaign comes in the wake of fanatics from the so - called @entity145 based in @entity146 and @entity147 threatening @entity148			2
@entity150 groups have also called on would - be terrorists to launch ‘ lone wolf ’ attacks against @entity148 soldiers and police			1
on christmas eve , @entity156 ( @entity156 ) encouraged @entity157 to launch attacks in the @entity159 on their own			0
it published a magazine that gave instructions for a home - made bomb , and urged its readers to use such a device to blow up an airliner or other @entity136 target			0
former soldiers said last night that the changes were needed as sentries felt vulnerable to attack			2
one guards insider said : ‘ we ’re fully in favour as if an attack on a sentry can happen in @entity38 it can happen here			1
by moving behind the railings we ’ve got a chance to respond , most likely saving lives			0
‘ the changes were introduced in response to the @entity38 attack and because there ’s been a sharp rise in people armed with mobile phones trying to wind up the sentries and make them lose their temper			1
’ former @entity193 guardsman and former @entity195 police officer @entity192 said : ‘ moving the @entity196 back to a more secure area seems an honourable retreat given the danger posed by the terrorists			1
' we have got to strike a balance between not compromising our traditions and protecting our soldiers			0
‘ unfortunately this is a sign of the times and how unpredictable the current situation is			0
' we ’ve seen horrific incidents across the world and in our capital city , so some action had to be taken to reduce the risk , even if it can never be eliminated			0
‘ you could argue that there should be a defiant stand but how do you protect the soldiers on parade in a bright suit , shiny boots and a furry hat ? ' where do we draw the line ? do you allow these soldiers to be armed ? i think that could cause a greater problem			1
' the terrorists know that a @entity196 is a higher profile target than an ordinary soldier and they ’re looking for publicity , something spectacular , so the guards would suit their agenda			0
’ although there have not been any successful terror attacks in @entity148 since @entity33 was killed outside @entity236 in may last year , intelligence services say they have foiled a number of plots this year			2
last month , police stopped an alleged plot to launch an attack on @entity242 , after arresting four men in @entity85 and @entity244 , @entity245			2
also last month , police chiefs warned officers not to wear their uniforms to and from work as @entity15 terrorists were looking to target officers			0
in october , @entity157 convert @entity252 , 32 , shot dead sentry @entity253 , 24 , outside the @entity254 in @entity255 , @entity38 , then stormed into the nearby @entity37 building before being shot dead by security guards			1
the soldiers currently performing ceremonial duties outside the royal palaces are drawn from the @entity261 , @entity262 of the @entity41 and @entity263 of the @entity264			2
these guardsmen carry rifles equipped with bayonets but as a rule their rifles are not loaded with live ammunition			0
the @entity196 may carry up to six rounds in a belt pouch and may load their rifles in event of a terrorist attack , but that would take valuable time			0
the two sentries beneath the clock tower at @entity61 ’s were temporarily withdrawn during the 1980s when the @entity20 threat level peaked , but @entity46 understands that this is the first time they have been redeployed permanently			1
@entity282 , princess @entity283 ’s former bodyguard , said : ‘ these officers are always stagnant , so an attack on them is very easy			2
' although the @entity287 are there to protect the @entity289 , the actual security is done by the @entity195			0
' but the @entity61 has always resisted getting rid of the guards as they are part of the tradition			1
the @entity61 would have been consulted on this			2
’ @entity295 , the former government watchdog on counter-terrorism , said : ‘ i think the changes are measured and not an over-reaction			2
’ @entity300 , deputy editor of the popular @entity302 blog , said : ‘ it is a shame , as it denies the public the chance of seeing these well - known uniforms that are part of the @entity148 identity			0
some may think it is a retreat			0
’ @entity311 and the @entity195 would not comment on security matters , while the @entity313 said : ‘ we routinely review security arrangements			2
