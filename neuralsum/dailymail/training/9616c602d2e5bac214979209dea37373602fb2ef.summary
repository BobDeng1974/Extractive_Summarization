more than 90 per cent of doctors defied union orders to strike yesterday – deciding their patients must come first			1
thousands of gps and hospital medics who had initially voted for industrial action appeared to back down on the day			2
in the end only 11,500 took part in the @entity9 's protest over changes to pensions			1
call for action : @entity13 , chairman of the @entity9 said doctors ' fight is not with patients but with the government but fears of more widespread support meant tens of thousands of operations – ranging from cataracts to hip replacements and heart bypass surgery – were needlessly cancelled in advance			1
as it turned out , many patients given a postponed date could have been treated yesterday			2
some have been told they will now not go into theatre for another three months			2
the @entity9 insisted it had tried to ' minimise ' the impact on patients and that anyone whose condition was life - threatening or urgent would be seen			1
figures from the @entity35 revealed that the strike led to the cancellation of 2,700 operations and a further 18,750 consultations			1
the protest also meant a quarter of gp practices – 2,000 surgeries – refused to accept patients unless it was urgent			1
campaigners accused doctors of being ' incredibly callous ' for causing distress to patients			1
the strike snub suggested that thousands of doctors who had voted to take part subsequently had second thoughts			1
more than 80 per cent of those who responded to the @entity9 's ballot last month backed industrial action			1
strike action : only 11,500 took part in the @entity9 's protest over changes to pensions but , as not all doctors voted – and many do n't even belong to the union – this works out as about 40,000 of the 150,000 doctors in @entity67			1
if only 11,500 took part in the strike , nearly 30,000 who initially said yes appear to have changed their minds			1
in recent days even senior members of the @entity9 admitted that doctors had been ' struggling with their consciences '			1
dr @entity76 , chairman of the union 's gp branch in @entity79 , said some of his colleagues had been having ' second thoughts '			1
despite the low turnout , patient groups remained highly critical of the strike			1
concerned : health secretary @entity86 said : ' we asked doctors to recognise that their quarrel was not with patients but with the government			1
' @entity92 , director of @entity93 , said it was a ' very sad day ' for the profession			0
' the protest has been motivated by greed and selfishness , ' he said			1
' i can not understand how a profession who are meant to be so bright can be so stupid			0
' it 's shocking that people will have to wait three months for surgery because of this			1
people get extremely wound up and upset about operations which , in some cases , are potentially high risk			1
' @entity110 , of the @entity111 , said the protest would impact on ' quality of life ' , adding : ' this industrial action will have implications long after doctors go back to work			1
' and @entity118 , director of @entity119 , said : ' we genuinely feel for and share the distress of the thousands of patients that have been affected			0
this action is not fair on them			0
' patient @entity126 , from @entity127 , was meant to be having spinal surgery yesterday at @entity129 in @entity130			0
he was told the day beforehand that it was cancelled			0
' i did n't realise how subconsciously i had prepared myself mentally for the operation , ' he said			0
' it 's major surgery , there 's a lot of risks involved			2
' what 's most frustrating is apparently my surgeon would have been prepared to do the surgery			2
however , he was unable to find an anaesthetist who was n't a member of one of the unions to knock me out			0
' so somewhere in one of the hospitals in @entity130 there 's a very highly paid , very clever surgeon unable to carry out his work properly because of the arrogance of the anaesthetist			2
' dr @entity13 , the head of the @entity9 , defended the disruption			1
he said : ' our intention has not been to maximise the impact on patients , but to communicate the scale of doctors ' anger and to encourage the government back to the table			2
' he also claimed the true turnout for the action was far higher			0
' the government 's figures need to be treated with extreme caution , ' he said			2
' doctors have sent a strong message that a fairer approach must be found			2
' health secretary @entity86 said : ' we asked doctors to recognise that their quarrel was not with patients but with the government			2
' i am pleased that a significant majority of doctors have done just that and maintained services for their patients			2
but let us not forget that the consequence of the @entity9 's decision to ask doctors to go on strike has been that thousands of patients who expected to have an operation or an appointment today have been inconvenienced			1
' it is extremely regrettable if any patients have suffered unnecessarily			0
' the @entity9 was protesting over @entity175 changes to doctors ' pensions which will see them contribute more and retire later			1
but @entity194 , a pensions expert , said consultants ' annual pensions of £ 48,000 a year were ' very generous '			0
a typical consultant earning £ 120,000 a year contributes a lower proportion from their salary than a nurse – despite earning five times more			0
by @entity202 and @entity203 for @entity9 chairman @entity13 , yesterday was all about taking industrial action in a bid to protect enviable pension pots			1
but gps at his former practice were instead using their valuable time to put their highly trained minds and vital skills to rather more constructive use – treating patients			0
none of the five doctors at the @entity217 , where dr @entity13 worked from 1978 until retiring in march last year , went on strike			1
mr @entity13 said yesterday was all about taking industrial action in a bid to protect enviable pension pots ' we are busy			0
we are working normally , ' said a receptionist at the practice in @entity225			0
nor were they alone in putting medical care before concern for feathering their own nests			0
around 6,000 – or 75 per cent – of gp surgeries across the country provided routine appointments yesterday , according to @entity35 figures			0
fears of being turned away by their gp failed to materialise for the vast majority of patients			0
and with many deciding to stay away , all too aware of the well - publicised strike , waiting rooms were less crowded			2
we were looked after really well , ' said mother - of - one @entity243 , 34 , who brought her eight - year - old daughter @entity244 to the @entity245 , in north - west @entity246			0
@entity247 in @entity225 , which remained open despite the industrial action ' normally we have to wait between 30 and 45 minutes to be seen , but today we were straight in to see the doctor			0
' another patient there , charity worker @entity250 , 32 , a mother of one , said she was given an early morning appointment ' straight away ' after calling in with tonsillitis			0
the clinic is headed by another @entity9 bigwig , dr @entity257 , the chairman of the @entity258			1
on a normal day , he would see up to 50 people , but by lunchtime yesterday he had only seen two			0
' it has been incredibly quiet , ' he said			0
' what we are doing is seeing urgent and emergency patients , anyone who says “ will you see me ” , the answer is “ yes ”			0
' in @entity273 , dr @entity271 , treasurer of the @entity9 and , until the end of last year , chairman of its pensions committee , was not at his surgery			1
he has not worked there on thursdays for the past ten years due to his @entity9 commitments , but kept in contact with colleagues yesterday			1
during morning ' open access ' sessions at the practice in @entity283 , more than 100 patients are normally seen by four to six doctors			2
yesterday it was less than a third of that			0
dr @entity271 said : ' interestingly , it appears a lot of our patients have not come in today because they know their conditions are not acute			0
' everybody has had the opportunity to come in and be assessed but we have been treating emergency and urgent patients only			0
' asked if the strike had been a damp squib , he replied : ' today has been about taking industrial action while making sure patients are not a risk			2
i think that is what we have done			0
' asked if it had diminished trust in doctors , he said : ' over the past 20 years doctors have been the most trusted profession in this country while @entity314 and ministers have been among the least trusted			2
' so when the medical profession takes industrial action because it ca n't tolerate something which it says is unfair , who do you think a member of the public is going to trust ? ' at the practice of the @entity9 's @entity327 deputy chairman dr @entity326 , @entity328 in @entity329 , patients praised the doctors for carrying on as normal			1
@entity331 , 67 , said : ' i called earlier to see if there was any problems but they said it was business as usual			0

in the end only 11,500 took part in the @entity9 's protest
strike led to the cancellation of 2,700 operations and 18,750 consultations
@entity9 admitted that doctors had been ' struggling with their consciences '
