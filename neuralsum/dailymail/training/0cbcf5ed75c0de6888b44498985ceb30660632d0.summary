pro-russian rebels have shot down a helicopter from the skies above @entity3 in eastern @entity4 with nine people thought to have been killed in the single burst of violence			1
the @entity4 helicopter was carrying military cargo when it was brought down by the rebel fire			1
only days ago did new @entity4 president @entity11 initiate his ceasefire for the region in an attempt to quell the violence which has been plaguing the region for months			1
' the violence comes just as @entity30 president @entity18 staged an extraordinary retreat in seeking the withdrawal of a resolution by the @entity30 parliament allowing him to send @entity30 troops into @entity4			1
his climbdown appeared to be a victory for the @entity40 's threat of brutal new sanctions unless he backed peace moves in @entity4			1
@entity30 senators granted mr @entity18 the right to send the army into @entity4 on march 1 , but yesterday he called for the removal of this threat against his neighbouring state			1
while the @entity40 remained wary , the @entity50 claimed @entity18 was committed to ' normalising the atmosphere and resolving the situation in the eastern regions of @entity4 '			1
however , the @entity30 strongman is adamant that the @entity4 government must hold direct talks with separatist leaders which @entity58 has labelled ' terrorists '			2
and he retains 65,000 troops on active combat alert in central @entity30			0
mr @entity11 dubbed mr @entity18 's surprise move his ' first practical step ' in support of the peace plan to end the worst east - west conflict since the end of the @entity69 in which at least 375 have perished			1
until now , the @entity40 saw mr @entity18 as pouring fuel on crisis in a bid to destabilise @entity4 because its new government was looking towards @entity74 rather than @entity30			1
there were genuine fears he could invade eastern @entity4			1
the @entity77 and @entity78 had threatened mr @entity18 with sanctions that would damage entire sectors of his already ailing economy unless he showed his backing for the peace plan			1
@entity4 government army volunteers taking the oath of allegiance after agreeing to help operations in the east on monday the volunteers joined the government battalion @entity91 and will help in @entity92 and @entity93 they also spent time praying before they head east where nine of their new colleagues have just been killed until now , @entity98 has scoffed at the penalties imposed by the @entity40 over the march annexation of @entity101			1
but yesterday the @entity30 financial markets surged and the rouble rose to its highest level since mid-january			0
mr @entity18 acted after initial talks between @entity11 's envoy , ex-president @entity107 , and separatist leaders			1
despite this , a ceasefire agreed to by the rebels runs out on friday , and many separatists remain opposed to any deal as evidenced by an attack on @entity107 's car in @entity92			1
mr @entity18 yesterday kept his forces on combat alert drilling in ' peacekeeping duties '			2
the @entity40 has feared such a pretext could be used by the @entity30 leader to send his forces into @entity4			2
after a phone call between @entity123 and mr @entity18 , the @entity121 stressed that @entity30 ' will face additional costs if we do not see concrete actions to de-escalate the situation '			2
the drill involves 180 warplanes , 60 helicopters , and 5,500 weapons			0
a @entity133 warship intercepted a @entity30 military vessel that strayed close to @entity136 - protected waters in the @entity137 in an echo of the @entity69			2
@entity139 , a type 23 frigate , was taking part in a multinational exercise off the @entity144 coast when she was dispatched to investigate an unidentified surface ship picked up on radar			0
despite choppy seas and 30 knot winds , the crew identified the unknown ship as the 104 metre - long @entity153 - class frigate @entity154 skirting @entity144 waters as it sailed west in the @entity156			0
as @entity139 closed with the @entity30 vessel , a @entity30 @entity158 ‘ @entity159 ’ maritime patrol aircraft was detected and appeared overhead , circling the two ships			0
it was one of the @entity133 's most significant encounters with @entity30 warships in the region since the @entity4 crisis began			2
@entity133 chiefs said the show of strength demonstrated @entity136 ’s resolve to protect its 28 - members against any threat from the kremlin			0
both the @entity30 vessel and aircraft appeared to be carrying out routine manoeuvres in international waters			2
commander @entity178 , commanding officer of @entity139 , said : ‘ all our interaction so far has been professional , and effective , and we have gained huge benefit from working so closely with our allies in such a busy and challenging environment			0
’ lieutenant @entity184 , @entity139 ’s watch officer , said : ‘ we picked up a vessel on our radar that was not showing any of the normal behaviour expected of merchant vessels or allied warships			0
we have seen the @entity30 operate a lot in this area but this is the closest we have seen them			0
’ @entity193 - based @entity139 , which has 205 crew and is armed with @entity196 torpedoes , @entity198 missiles and @entity200 missiles , is taking part in the @entity77 - led exercise involving warships , submarines and helicopters from 14 different nations			0
last week two @entity208 fighters shadowed seven menacing @entity30 warplanes that flew too close to @entity156 airspace			0
the fully - armed @entity211 from @entity212 were scrambled after unidentified aircraft were detected by @entity136 air defences in international airspace			0
all were subsequently identified as @entity30			0
four @entity211 were deployed to the region in april under orders to respond forcefully to any violation of the airspace of @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 which do not have their own air defence fighters and rely upon @entity136 .			0
