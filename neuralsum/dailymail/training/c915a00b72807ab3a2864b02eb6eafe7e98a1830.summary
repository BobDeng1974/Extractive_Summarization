killed : @entity0 was shot and killed by officer @entity1 in august , prompting a firestorm of protests in the @entity5 , @entity6 , suburb			1
supporters of the white cop who shot dead a black teenager in @entity6 have published a slick video attacking @entity11 for failing to back the officer ’s family			1
the seven - minute clip says that the president should have got in touch with @entity1 ’s relatives to give them his support in the wake of the august 9 killing in @entity21 , a suburb of @entity5			1
the video says that @entity1 ’s life was ‘ turned upside down ’ and that mr @entity11 aligned himself with @entity0 , the 18 - year - old who was killed			1
the unabashed footage is upbeat in tone and is set to two songs : ‘ @entity28 ’ by rock band @entity29 and ‘ we ’re not gunna take it any more ’ by @entity31			0
it makes clear the strength of feeling among some in @entity5 that @entity1 , 28 , is the victim and not just @entity0			1
the footage also uses inflammatory language to attack @entity0 and calls him a ‘ thug criminal ’ who carried out a robbery shortly before he was killed			1
provocative : the video accuses president @entity11 of failing to support officer @entity1 , labelling the dead teenager ' a thug criminal ' in the spotlight : officer @entity1 is awaiting the decision of a grand jury convened in the wake of his shooting to death of @entity0			1
the video claims that protesters were denying him a part in the debate over the killing it calls his friend @entity56 , who was with @entity0 the night he died , ‘ one lying witness / accomplice ( who ) forever changed the fate of @entity21 ’			1
the video emerged as the @entity62 continue to deliberate whether to indict @entity1 , who has been in hiding for the past three months			2
it has so far been watched 5,000 times on @entity65 and is called : ‘ we are @entity67 ! ’ the seven minute clip goes through the story of how @entity1 ’s supporters felt that his voice had to be heard and so set about organising themselves			1
in a series of stills with text over the top they say that some used the story of @entity0 ’s death ‘ as an excuse to commit crimes ’ , though many of the protests were peaceful and the organisers discouraged violence			0
civil rights campaigners the @entity88 , the @entity89 and attorney general @entity90 are described as being ‘ antagonistic friends ’			1
along with @entity6 governor @entity93 they turned the story into a ‘ race war ’ in order to ‘ rob officer @entity1 of justice ’ , the video claims			1
it then shows a series of photos which have been sent in of supporters - many in law enforcement - with the caption : ‘ i am @entity1 ’			2
the video says : ‘ not once did the president send condolences to @entity1 for his life being turned upside down while defending himself against a thug criminal ’			1
president @entity11 did however release a statement to @entity0 ’s family which read : ‘ the death of @entity0 is heartbreaking , and @entity113 and i send our deepest condolences to his family and his community at this very difficult time ’			2
attack : from left @entity89 , @entity88 and @entity90 , the attorney - general , are accused of giving succor to anti-police protesters in the video			1
all three men went to @entity21 in the wake of the killing damage : the video equates protesters with the looters who rioted after the death and suggests the facts support @entity1 @entity1 ’s supporters have carried out a number of rallies around @entity5 and set up the ‘ i support officer @entity1 ’ @entity136 page which now has 78,000 likes			1
the ‘ support @entity1 ’ community has 81,000 likes			0
one of the latest comments from user @entity143 reads : ‘ @entity144 wait for that " not guilty " verdict to be announced ! ’ @entity1 ’s supporters first made themselves heard in their first rally held a week after @entity0 was shot dead			1
during the protest in the @entity149 area of @entity5 they wore specially printed $ 7 t - shirts with a police shield on them and the words : ‘ i stand by @entity1 ’			2
instead of a badge number it read 8.9.14 , which is day he shot dead @entity0			2
division : while supporters of @entity1 have released their new video , opponents want to see a criminal trial for first - degree murder - and a finding of guilt			1
this demonstrator made her point last night in front of @entity21 's police department in the @entity5 suburb tension : @entity21 and surrounding areas are on a knife - edge as the grand jury deliberations on whether to indict officer @entity1 over the killing of @entity0 are expected to conclude			1
@entity1 ’s supporters say he is the one who is being slandered and some have even claimed that he should get compensation for the way he has been treated			0
according to @entity31 ’s singer @entity182 , ‘ we ’re not gunna take it ’ was intended to be played ‘ any time that the team is down by two , or somebody had a bad day at the office ’			0
it was used by 2012 @entity185 vice-presidential candidate @entity184 until @entity182 asked him not too - as he was going to vote for president @entity11			0
by @entity186 , @entity6 a group describing itself as a ' @entity189 ' to a ' corrupt police state ' has offered $ 5000 for details of @entity21 police officer @entity1 's whereabouts , @entity187 can reveal			1
officer @entity1 , 28 , has been in hiding on paid leave ever since he gunned down unarmed teenager @entity0 , 18 , on 9 august			1
now , in one of a series of incendiary tweets the @entity199 have stated , ' we are paying $ 5k cash for location of @entity202			0
real $ , no joke , no crime we just wana get his photo an ask him a few questions			0
' and though the @entity199 insist this is not a bounty on the officer 's head , the chilling offer is set in the context of a stream of violent online posts boasting of ' combat experience ' , ' stockpiling ' ammunition , cleaning out gun stores and being # @entity217			0
the incendiary tweet from the group : part of a twitter feed which includes references to ' war ready ' which is likely to increase tensions in @entity21 ahead of the expected grand jury verdict on the shooting of @entity0 by police office @entity1 the ' @entity199 ' have used their @entity228 feed to claim the police are preparing for ' war ' when the grand just verdict is announced pointed : the feed includes a reference to ammunition which will ' solve a lot of problems '			1
the @entity237 has already warned that extremist violence is ' likely '			0
typical of the reponse elicited by the offer is one follower 's demand , ' @ @entity243 that bastard off the street			0
he is a murderer running free still			0
' governor @entity93 has already declared a state of emergency and called in the @entity247 in anticipation of the violence that @entity237 agents have described as ' inevitable ' when the @entity62 charged with deciding the fate of officer @entity1 , 28 , delivers their verdict			2
having promised that a decision would be reached ' by late november ' it now seems likely that the @entity62 will return that decision this week			0
a series of @entity62 leaks , and @entity6 law which allows officers to use lethal force if they believe their life to be in danger , have led many to believe that @entity1 will not be indicted on murder charges as @entity0 's family and supporters hope			2
it is three months since @entity1 pumped six bullets into the teenager as he walked down the middle of the road with a friend			2
in the wake of the shooting which ignited racial tension in the @entity6 town rioters took to the streets armed with @entity280 cocktails and chanting the slogan ' @entity282 do n't shoot ' - a reference to some witness accounts that the teenager had his hands up in surrender when @entity1 fired off his fatal volley of shots			2
@entity291 's disturbing offer and tweets show the seething anger and hunger for violence among some agitators			0
they have no faith in the judicial system and seem intent on ignoring official calls for peaceful protest and calm			0
as reported by @entity187 that chatter has extended to @entity5 own police officers			0
writing on the forum @entity305 one user writing under the username ' a @entity309 ' advised residents , ' if you do not have a gun , get one and get one soon			0
we will not be able to protect you or your family			0
' in what appeared to be a direct strike at governor @entity93 's decision to activate the @entity247 rather than entrusting @entity5 's own force with policing the streets of @entity21 , the user continued , ' it will be your responsibility to protect them			2
our gutless commanders and politicians have neutered us			0
' i 'm serious , get a gun , get more than one , and keep one with you at all times			0
