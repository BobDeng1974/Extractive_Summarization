by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent mps should be sent on ‘ honesty ’ classes to ensure they adhere to ethical standards while in public office , the sleaze watchdog said last night			1
the @entity8 said all new mps must undergo an induction programme to drill into them the ‘ seven principles of public life ’			1
these principles , drawn up in the 1990s , state that all those in public office should abide by standards of selflessness , integrity , objectivity , accountability , openness , honesty and leadership			1
@entity25 said ethics classes would be needed all the more if @entity27 passes a @entity28 , under which members of the public would be able to expel an mp if they are deemed to have fallen short the rules were drawn up following allegations that mps were receiving cash to ask questions in the @entity37			2
but they did not prevent scandals such as @entity34 ’ expenses , leading to fears that more needs to be done to instil into @entity34 their responsibilities			0
the chairman of the committee , @entity25 , said he was concerned that only small numbers of mps ever turned up at induction courses which are currently offered on ethical standards			2
after the last election in 2010 , fewer than one in five new mps attended induction meetings , and one workshop on dealing with ethical dilemmas had to be cancelled due to poor take - up			1
@entity25 said that all new mps should have to go on them			0
he said ethics classes would be needed all the more if @entity27 passes a @entity28 , under which members of the public would be able to expel an mp if they are deemed to have fallen short			0
in his report , ethics in @entity60 , @entity25 also called for special advisers – senior political aides to ministers – to be sent on the courses			0
awareness and understanding of the @entity67 can not be left to chance , ’ he said			0
‘ we need to make sure that all of those in public life are aware of their ethical responsibilities and are prepared to act as ethical leaders			1
the public expects nothing less			0
‘ of particular concern to us was the reported lack of engagement with induction by large numbers of members of @entity27			2
‘ with the prospect of a @entity28 , which will give the public the power to remove mps who have behaved in ways that fall short of the standards expected of them , the stakes have never been higher			1
the man in the white suit : former independent mp @entity90 thinks that @entity34 should be forced to undergo classes in honesty in effect , ethical issues will now be under even greater scrutiny			2
‘ more than ever , mps need to be fully aware of the principles and the rules that guide their behaviour ; @entity27 and the political parties need to provide the opportunities for them to build that awareness and understanding			1
‘ an induction programme that fully embraces ethical standards should be the first of those opportunities			1
’ the @entity108 , a constitutional think tank , said officials estimated that just 19 per cent of new members had attended at least one session of the induction programme in 2010			1
@entity113 rarely rises above six mps at any one time , and one workshop on ethical dilemmas had to be cancelled altogether			0
some mps are against the induction classes , telling the @entity108 : ‘ the executive would like to train members of parliament			2
it absolutely must n’t happen			0
’ but former mp and @entity123 journalist @entity90 said last night : ‘ i think it ’s a good idea			0
‘ it does n’t have to be very long or complicated , but it ’s a good way to make sure that they do n’t break the rules			0
