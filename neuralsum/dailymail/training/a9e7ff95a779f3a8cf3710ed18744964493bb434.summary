enough already : @entity16 , @entity6 ( pictured ) is no stranger to lake effect snow and received this blanketing at @entity49			2
the city is now braced for another two feet by friday how it works : as cold , dry air blows across the relatively warm lakes , it gathers moisture and eventually releases it as snow frigid days ahead : the air currently blowing across the @entity41 is the coldest arctic blast of the season and is due to stretch through the @entity59 , the @entity60 and then chill most of the @entity61 by thursday in addition to @entity2 , parts of @entity35 , @entity63 and @entity64 also commonly feel the effects			2

no reprieve : while @entity6 will be spared the lashing of snow it received on tuesday , by thursday the arctic chill causing massive lake effect snow will force temperatures from @entity81 through @entity2 to @entity21 down to the season 's lowest so far			1

@entity6 from @entity7 to @entity8 could see three feet of snow by the end of the week
