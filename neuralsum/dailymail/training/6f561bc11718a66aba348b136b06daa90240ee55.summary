by @entity0 proposals : @entity2 , the chief secretary to the treasury , unveiled proposals to introduce higher council tax bands to take in properties worth more than £ 2 million tens of thousands of homes will be hit by a reformed ‘ mansion tax ’ shortly after the general election under @entity10 plans			1
@entity2 , the chief secretary to the treasury , unveiled proposals to introduce higher council tax bands to take in properties worth more than £ 2 million			1
but nine in ten of those forced to pay the extra levy would live in @entity15 and the @entity16 - in houses rather than mansions - thanks to soaring property prices			1
mr @entity2 however played down the impact on homeowners , saying that those in receipt of council tax benefit or who were on low incomes could be exempt or get discounts			1
but he admitted the policy would ‘ release a wee bit of steam ’ from the top end of the housing market			1
pensioners who have expensive homes but low incomes would be able to defer the tax until after their death , aides to mr @entity2 later said			0
the new levy would be paid in addition to ordinary council tax			2
although local authorities would collect the levy , the revenue would go straight to the @entity44			2
however the reform is a partial climb down for the @entity10 , who planned to introduce a flat one per cent tax on properties worth more than £ 2 million for every pound over that threshold			0
mr @entity2 told a business audience that his new proposal had been subjected to @entity44 modelling and would be a ‘ modest , additional banded levy on top of council tax for high value properties ’			1
‘ the annual charges , in addition to council tax will be set out in good time ahead of the general election next year			2
’ he added : ‘ by building on the council tax system , there will be no need for a detailed valuation of the small proportion of properties affected			1
crucially , this means that this policy could be implemented quickly after the election			2
’ mr @entity2 added that ‘ with the level of the bands up rated annually , people living in typical family homes need have no fear of being sucked into this levy			1
’ a revaluation has been put off by successive governments , as it would be hugely expensive , politically unpopular and force thousands of home owners into higher bands			2
under the new plans , anyone in a house under £ 2 million would continue to pay council tax as usual and face no extra levy			2
concentrated : according to figures from property website @entity90 , more than a third of the 82,269 houses that are worth more than £ 2 million are in a single @entity15 borough - @entity92 and @entity93 mr @entity2 - who is tipped as a potential successor to @entity95 as leader of the @entity10 - will not set out the bands until closer to the general election			1
but he did cite an example of an £ 8 million home which might fall into a band of £ 5 million to £ 10 million			0
the cabinet minister said the broader bands would ensure there were fewer challenges about the valuations of homes			0
he had feared that the previous @entity10 policy of would lead to a wave of appeals against property valuations			0
but according to figures from property website @entity90 , more than a third of the 82,269 houses that are worth more than £ 2 million are in a single @entity15 borough - @entity92 and @entity93			1
a further 31 per cent are in the boroughs of @entity115 and @entity116			0
@entity117 of @entity90 said : ‘ homeowners in @entity15 and the @entity16 already pay the lion ’s share of @entity121 property taxes with the stamp duty thresholds placing a heavy burden already on higher priced properties			1
’ promises : @entity126 has pledged to introduce mansion tax if he becomes prime minister nearly 11,000 homes worth more than £ 2 million are outside the capital but in the @entity16 , according to the research drawn from @entity133 figures			1
mr @entity2 ’s new mansion tax would raise an estimated £ 1.2 billion a year			0
this is less than the £ 1.7 billion to £ 2 billion previously cited by both the @entity10 and @entity136			0
@entity126 has also pledged to introduce a mansion tax if he becomes prime minister			0
the @entity139 had previously warned that a flat one per cent mansion tax on properties over £ 2 million could be turned into a political football and deter investment and development			0
but it welcomed the new proposals			0
@entity148 , chief executive of the @entity139 , said : ‘ we are delighted that the @entity10 are taking this much more sensible approach to the @entity151			1
the council tax system remains in principle a better way of taxing property , if the valuations on which it is based are up - to - date			0
‘ at present we have a property tax that is based on 1991 values , when the average house in the @entity121 was worth , £ 62,000 , the @entity158 was still in existence and @entity163 topped the charts			0
adding some additional bands of council tax makes sense as a sticking - plaster measure , but ultimately if fairness is politicians ’ goal then only a full revaluation in conjunction with more bands will do this			0

nine in ten of those affected by levy would live in @entity15 and @entity16
