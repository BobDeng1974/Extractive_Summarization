@entity5 will be available on prescription only for patients with the skin condition rosacea , which causes blushing and also permanent redness			1
the gel contains brimonidine , a drug used to treat the eye disease glaucoma			1

skin aid : the new gel , @entity5 , will help patients with the skin condition rosacea , which causes blushing and also permanent redness rosacea is a genetic condition that affects about one in ten people in the @entity29			1
usually appearing in people from their mid- 30s onwards , it causes blood vessels in the face to dilate , leading to redness and uncontrollable flushing			0
the condition can be triggered by sunlight , saunas , spicy food , alcohol or stress			0
in severe cases , rosacea can cause acne - like pustules on the face and can even thicken and distort the skin of the nose			2
although @entity5 is not a cure , it causes the vessels to contract and become less visible for about 12 hours			1
dr @entity51 , consultant dermatologist at @entity52 in @entity53 , recently conducted @entity29 trials on @entity5			1
he found patients responded well to the treatment			0
‘ rosacea sufferers often find the facial redness very disfiguring and even disabling , ’ he says			0
‘ the flushing can appear at the most inopportune times , such as when people are at a job interview or are trying to impress someone			0
new purpose : the gel contains brimonidine , a drug used in eye drops to treat glaucoma ‘ patients often also suffer a burning sensation at the same time			1
it makes them feel wretched and out of control			0
some become depressed and a few even feel suicidal			0
‘ until now there has n’t been much that effectively treated the redness and flushing			0
even if patients have expensive laser treatments , the redness tends to come back			0
to have this is helpful not just for my patients ’ skin , but their self - worth too			2
’ @entity5 was cleared by the @entity83 ( @entity83 ) in august 2013 and by @entity85 regulators last week , meaning it can now be introduced in the @entity29			1
dr @entity51 says he found that @entity5 cleared redness within a few minutes in some patients			1
and studies conducted by @entity91 , which manufactures @entity5 , suggest it may be effective at reducing visible redness in about 70 per cent of patients			1
between one and four per cent of users can have side effects , including , ironically , rebound redness and skin irritation			2
if @entity5 is applied patchily , the face will have red areas where the cream was missed			1
dermatologist dr @entity103 , of the @entity104 in @entity53 , says : ‘ i have been interested in brimonidine for some time now , and think @entity5 is going to be very helpful when treating rosacea			2
it can be used in conjunction with other medications such as antibiotics and lasers			0
however , some of my patients who have used it say they have experienced stinging and increased redness			0
’ despite these issues , some desperate patients are already buying @entity5 over the internet from the @entity117			2
dr @entity103 and dr @entity51 say they will be keen to consider prescribing @entity5 to patients when it becomes available next month			2
health trusts will now have to decide whether to offer it to patients in their area – it is expected to cost the @entity124 as little as 50p a day per patient			0
@entity5 will be also be available privately			2
a 30g tube that lasts between 30 and 60 days should cost less than £ 35 .			0
