getting to @entity0 is no easy feat : the journey of several hundred million miles takes about nine months , one - way , and a manned mission will likely in total take about three years			1
so one scientist took a look at different types of propulsion - including nuclear - to find out if there was a quicker way to get there			0
but it seems that , aside from an engineering breakthrough , we ca n’t really shorten these times - and he thinks it ’s unlikely we ’ll send humans within five decades , not the 2030s as @entity19 believes			1
dr @entity20 from the @entity21 was speaking to @entity22			1
he studied different types of propulsion that could get humans to @entity0 ( shown )			1
in total a manned mission would last three to four years , which poses major problems , such as exposure to radiation theoretical physicist dr @entity20 from the @entity21 , together with his colleagues dr @entity32 and dr @entity33 , carried out a study comparing different space propulsion methods for a manned mission to @entity0			1
option 1 - a ' giant leap ' from moon to @entity0 - return to the moon - build a lunar base - send humans to the surface of @entity0 @entity42 technological risk - send humans into lunar orbit - visit an asteroid in its own orbit - return to the moon 's surface - explore martian moons @entity51 and @entity52 - enter orbit around @entity0 - land on the red planet option 3 - @entity19 's current favoured path - @entity57 capture an asteroid - place it in lunar orbit for astronauts to visit - travel to the moons of @entity0 - @entity64 humans in @entity0 orbit - set foot on @entity0 based on the team ’s calculations , they found that the total mission time poses serious problems to a potential manned mission			1
in total the mission will last three to four years , which is ‘ very demanding ’ and ‘ almost impossible ’ according to dr @entity20			1
‘ despite what people say , we are a long way from reaching @entity0 , ’ he told @entity22			1
one particular issue is radiation			0
astronauts on a mission to and from @entity0 will be outside of @entity84 ’s magnetic field , and thus the risk of harm is much higher than when in @entity84 orbit			2
@entity19 ’s proposal is to send a mission there and back , but dr @entity20 said more infrastructure was needed to make the mission possible			1
‘ i see no way of reaching @entity0 in five decades , ’ said dr @entity20			1
‘ i do n’t believe one can reach @entity0 through a brute force approach			2
‘ you have to be able to create complicated and sophisticated means of avoiding these hazards			0
’ he added : ‘ there are too many thing we do n’t know , obstacles in travel and in the technology itself , and the mass budgets for a mission are immense			2
‘ i would like to be a bit more optimistic , but i ’m afraid this is how it is			1
’ various forms of propulsion have been touted for a mission to @entity0 , including chemical , ion ( electric ) and nuclear			1
but while nuclear is often said to be the ' holy grail ' , the team found it did not noticeably shorten the mission over other versions			0
shown is an illustration of a concept @entity124 dr @entity20 , who was also part of a science committee for @entity128 's satellite navigation programme @entity129 , instead suggests that we should consider returning to the lunar surface and improving our technologies , before attempting a mission to the red planet			1
owing to the orbits of @entity84 and @entity0 there are specific windows of opportunity when a mission can take place			2
our planets come as close to each other as 33.9 million miles ( 54.6 million km ) , but can be as distant as 250 million miles ( 400 million km )			0
for this reason spacecraft to @entity0 , such as the @entity144 , have to launch in certain windows when the planets are aligned			0
the next window is open from january 2016 to april 2016 , and will see the launch of two more missions to the red planet			0
for a future manned mission , they will need to launch out in one of the windows and return in one , which will take two years in total			1
just getting there will take up to nine months			0
the astronauts will be there waiting for a year until they can come back - a total of around three years			0
‘ from my point of view we should get back to moon , and i think it would be extremely useful to start with habitats at the moon , ’ he said			0
‘ once you can reach the moon on a regular basis , we will have learned a lot of things to achieve that			0
‘ i would never consider @entity0 before reaching this scientific level			2
’ in their study , the researchers looked at other methods of propulsion to see if there was any way to make a @entity0 mission more feasible in the near future			1
‘ reaching @entity0 is a complicated business , and you have to start with a strategy , ’ dr @entity20 said			1
for their study , they chose a mission plan that was similar to the @entity189 missions			0
the astronauts would start in low @entity84 orbit , then go to @entity0 and land , then return from @entity0 orbit and land on @entity84			2
they looked at four different kinds of propulsion - chemical , ion , nuclear and a concept electromagnetic engine			0
shown is a graph of the different types of propulsion for a mission to @entity0 , how much they would weigh and their travel time			1
@entity207 is a type of chemical propulsion , @entity206 is nuclear propulsion , @entity212 - @entity211 is ion ( electric ) propulsion and @entity215 is @entity216 but while a nuclear engine is often touted as the holy grail of space travel , the team found that for a mission to @entity0 , there was no benefit in such an engine			2
while it might be slightly faster , the mission time is still similar overall , but such an engine would cost and weight a lot more			0
@entity19 actually attempted to build a nuclear - powered engine before , known as @entity206 ( @entity206 ) , with a view to using it to get to @entity0 , but the programme was scrapped in 1972			2
in fact , the best way to reach @entity0 was a combination of chemical and ion engines - the former to reach orbit , on a rocket , and the latter for the cruise to @entity0			0
@entity19 actually attempted to build a nuclear - powered engine before , known as @entity206 ( @entity206 ) , shown in this illustration , with a view to using it to get to @entity0 , but the programme was scrapped in 1972 according to dr @entity20 and his team , the best way to reach @entity0 was a combination of chemical and ion ( shown ) engines - the former to reach orbit , on a rocket , and the latter for the cruise to @entity0 ‘ most people say that nuclear is helpful , ’ he continued			1
‘ it makes the flight time much shorter and the mass budget is lower			0
but it turns out basically that ’s not really the case			0
’ one of the proposals for nuclear propulsion is that a reactor could emit particles onto a giant sail , which would propel the craft forwards			0
this is similar to a solar sail but ‘ you carry your sun with you , ’ said dr @entity20			1
dr @entity20 says a problem arises because , while nuclear propulsion could accelerate to quite high speeds , it needs to brake again to enter orbit around the red planet			1
while it might be able to reach higher speeds for a mission to @entity0 over chemical and ion propulsion , the amount it would have to brake means that it does n't really reduce the time of the mission by any considerable margin			2
and the weight of hoisting a nuclear reactor into orbit , coupled with the cost , does not make it an attractive option			0
chemical propulsion is currently the only way to get from @entity84 into orbit , so any mission to @entity0 will have to still rely on it			2
@entity19 's @entity298 ( @entity298 ) rocket , illustrated , for example will use a combination of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to take a @entity0 - bound spacecraft into orbit ‘ at the end of the day , if you do the calculations properly , you find out that traditional measures like chemical and electrical turn out to be more efficient , ’ he said			1
‘ that ’s rather surprising			0
’ however , looking further into the future , dr @entity20 said if humans were to travel beyond @entity0 - such as to a moon of @entity316 - then nuclear propulsion becomes feasible			1
‘ beyond @entity0 then the issue is indeed to do it as fast as possible , and then i would think that nuclear propulsion would turn out to be the most interesting one , ’ he said			2
‘ i think for this particular case , nuclear propulsion will be the best option			0
‘ but again , i think we are still a long way to reaching that			0

dr @entity20 from the @entity21 was speaking to @entity22
he studied different types of propulsion that could get humans to @entity0
in total a manned mission would last three to four years , which poses major problems , such as exposure to radiation
he thinks @entity19 's plan to land humans there in the 2030s is not feasible
‘ i would like to be a bit more optimistic , but i ’m afraid this is how it is ’
