the @entity0 has struck down campaign donation limits that individual donors can make to candidates , political parties and political action committees in a landmark ruling handed down today			1
the justices ruled that @entity8 have a right to give the legal maximum to candidates for @entity12 and president , as well as to parties and pacs , without worrying that they will violate the law when they bump up against a limit on all contributions			1
that limit was set at $ 123,200 for 2013 and 2014			0
that includes a separate $ 48,600 cap on contributions to candidates			0
the decision will allow the wealthiest contributors to pour millions of dollars into candidate and party coffers , although those contributions will be subject to disclosure under federal law			2
continued fight : recent rulings - including the latest one handed down today - have helped wealthy individuals pile limitless funds into their favorite campaigns but comes as a blow to liberal activists ( @entity40 pictured in an october 2013 protest ) big donors already can spend unlimited amounts on attacks ads and other outlets that are not federally regulated , and those venues have played an increasingly important role in campaigns			1
but the court 's 5 - 4 decision does not undermine limits on individual contributions to candidates for president or @entity12 , now $ 2,600 an election			1
chief justice @entity56 announced the decision , which split the court 's liberal and conservative justices			0
@entity56 said the aggregate limits do not act to prevent corruption , the rationale the court has upheld as justifying contribution limits			0
the overall limits ‘ intrude without justification on a citizen 's ability to exercise ' the most fundamental @entity72 activities , ' ‘ @entity56 said , quoting from the court 's seminal 1976 campaign finance ruling in @entity67			2
justice @entity74 agreed with the outcome of the case , but wrote separately to say that he would have gone further and wiped away all contribution limits			0
justice @entity79 , writing for the liberal dissenters , said that the court 's conservatives had ‘ eviscerated our nation 's campaign finance laws ’ through wednesday 's ruling and 2010 decision in @entity86 that lifted limits on independent spending by corporations and labor unions			1
‘ if the court in @entity86 opened a door , today 's decision we fear will open a floodgate , ’ @entity79 said in comments from the bench			1
close call : the court 's 5 - 4 decision does not undermine limits on individual contributions to candidates for president or @entity12 , now $ 2,600 an election ‘ it understates the importance of protecting the political integrity of our governmental institution			1
it creates , we think , a loophole that will allow a single individual to contribute millions of dollars to a political party or to a candidate 's campaign			1
’ @entity12 enacted the limits in the wake of @entity118 - era abuses to discourage big contributors from trying to buy votes with their donations and to restore public confidence in the campaign finance system			0
but in a series of rulings in recent years , the @entity56 court has struck down provisions of federal law aimed at limiting the influence of big donors as unconstitutional curbs on free speech rights			0
most notably , in 2010 , the court divided 5 to 4 in the @entity86 case to free corporations and labor unions to spend as much as they wish on campaign advocacy , as long as it is independent of candidates and their campaigns			1
that decision did not affect contribution limits to individual candidates , political parties and political action committees			0
@entity147 activist @entity146 of @entity148 , @entity149 , the national @entity147 party and @entity152 @entity147 leader @entity151 of @entity153 challenged the overall limits on what contributors may give in a two - year federal election cycle			2
the total is $ 123,200 , including a separate $ 48,600 cap on contributions to candidates , for 2013 and 2014			2
conservative victory : justice @entity74 ( bottom left ) wrote that he supported the decision but would have gone further and gotten rid of all spending limits entirely limits on individual contributions , currently $ 2,600 per election to candidates for @entity12 , are not at issue			1
relaxed campaign finance rules have reduced the influence of political parties , @entity171 and the @entity147 argued			0
@entity146 gave the symbolically significant $ 1,776 to 15 candidates for @entity12 and wanted to give the same amount to 12 others			2
but doing so would have put him in violation of the cap			0
nearly 650 donors contributed the maximum amount to candidates , pacs and parties in the last election cycle , according to the @entity186			1
the court did not heed warnings from solicitor general @entity189 and advocates of campaign finance limits that donors would be able to funnel large amounts of money to a favored candidate in the absence of the overall limit			2
the @entity147 also called on the court to abandon its practice over nearly 40 years of evaluating limits on contributions less skeptically than restrictions on spending			0
the differing levels of scrutiny have allowed the court to uphold most contribution limits , because of the potential for corruption in large direct donations to candidates			0
at the same time , the court has found that independent spending does not pose the same risk of corruption and has applied a higher level of scrutiny to laws that seek to limit spending			0
if the court were to drop the distinction between contributions and expenditures , even limits on contributions to individual candidates for @entity12 , currently $ 2,600 per election , would be threatened , said @entity226 , a longtime supporter of stringent campaign finance laws .			1

today 's ruling means that donors can give the maximum amount to a candidate 's campaign , their pac , and their political party without worrying about the total limit
wealthy contributors could *theoretically* spend millions on the same candidate by giving to different *groups* supporting the same person
$ 2,600 limit for *specific* candidates and the president remains intact
comes years after *controversial* @entity86 ruling that allowed corporations and labor unions to spend unlimited amounts in campaigns
