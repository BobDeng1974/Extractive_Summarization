a controversial study claims to have found a link between wearing make - up during pregnancy and lower iq scores in children			1
exposure to the highest levels of two phthalate chemicals led to a lowering of iq scores at age seven by more than six points , @entity7 scientists found			1
the scientists claim the link remained after taking account of known factors that can influence child @entity16 , such as the mother 's intelligence and the quality of the home environment			1
they are found in everything from @entity33 flooring and shower curtains to car dashboards – and may also be in our food			1
tiny particles can enter our systems either through breathing or eating			0
researchers in the @entity42 investigated four phthalates and demonstrated an association with two , known as @entity45 and @entity46			2
both are found in a wide range of consumer products including dryer sheets , vinyl fabrics , lipstick , hairspray , nail polish and some soaps			2
children of mothers whose exposure to @entity45 and @entity46 was in the top 25 per cent had iq scores 6.6 and 7.6 points lower , respectively , than those of mothers exposed to the lowest concentrations ' the magnitude of these iq differences is troubling , ' said professor @entity67 , from @entity69 's @entity68 , who took part in the study			1
' a six or seven - point decline in @entity16 may have substantial consequences for academic achievement and occupational potential			1
' phthalates are man - made chemicals thought to interfere with the natural hormones that are crucial to overall health			1
they are found in everything from @entity33 flooring and shower curtains to car dashboards – and may also be in our food			1
tiny particles can enter our systems either through breathing or eating			0
in make - up , they are used by manufacturers to help dissolve other ingredients into a consistent solution , such as making nail polish less brittle			1
previous studies have linked them to diabetes and asthma			2
they have also been blamed for feminising the brains of baby boys and last year the @entity102 warned they have ' serious implications for health			0
the scientists assessed the pthalate exposure of 328 @entity42 women and their children , all of whom were from low - income communities			1
break down chemicals from the compounds left after they had been processed in the body were measured in urine samples during the last three months of pregnancy			0
children of mothers whose exposure to @entity45 and @entity46 was in the top 25 per cent had iq scores 6.6 and 7.6 points lower , respectively , than those of mothers exposed to the lowest concentrations			1
associations were also seen for specific aspects of @entity16 , such as perceptual reasoning , working memory and processing speed			2
none of the women had been exposed to unusual levels of the chemicals , the researchers said , whose findings were reported in the online journal @entity138			2
lead author dr @entity139 , also from @entity69 , said : ' pregnant women across the @entity7 are exposed to phthalates almost daily , many at levels similar to those that we found were associated with substantial reductions in the iq of children			1
' while there has been some regulation to ban phthalates from toys of young children , there is no legislation governing exposure during pregnancy , which is likely the most sensitive period for brain development			2
' indeed , phthalates are not required to be on product labelling			0
' the scientists urged pregnant women not to microwave food in plastic containers , to avoid scented products as much as possible , and not to use certain recyclable plastics			0
in an earlier study , the same researchers found negative associations between exposure to @entity45 and @entity46 in the womb and children 's mental and motor development and behaviour at age three			1
earlier this year , the same group found that babies exposed to high levels of phthalates while in the womb are up to 78 per cent more at risk of getting asthma			1
dr @entity67 , said : ' these chemicals are very widely used in very high volume and they are not generally listed on labels			0
' there are some simple steps families can take			0
avoid using plastic containers and as much as you can store your food in glass jars in the fridge			0
' she also suggested women check their make - up on the internet for phthalates			1
phthalates are thought to be ‘ endocrine - disrupting chemicals ’ , or @entity198 , capable of interfering with the way our glands produce hormones			1
the cosmetics industry is particularly sensitive to suggestions that some ingredients might be @entity198			0
in 2012 , the @entity206 asked manufacturers to stop using 17 @entity198			0
the makers of 58 brands agreed , but companies behind some of the world ’s biggest brands did not , and found their products named and shamed by the council			0
last year a @entity102 study concluded , to do nothing now was to ignore a vital lesson from the past			0
we should ‘ ban chemicals in order to reduce exposure early , even when there are significant but incomplete data but before there is significant and long - lasting harm ’			2
not all experts agree — in september , 18 editors of pharmacology and toxicology journals signed a letter saying the @entity234 ’s proposals were driven by ‘ scientifically unfounded precaution ’ , defying ‘ common sense , well - established science and risk assessment principles ’			0
it has since been revealed that 17 of the 18 editors had worked with the chemical , pharmaceutical , cosmetic , tobacco , pesticide or biotechnology industries			0
a recent study linked low libido with the additives used to soften plastics which are found in every home chemicals found in pvc flooring , plastic shower curtains , processed food and other trappings of modern life may be sapping women 's interest in sex			1
a study in @entity262 linked low libido with the additives used to soften plastics which are found in every home			2
women with the highest levels of phthalates in their bodies were more than twice as likely to say ' not tonight dear ' as those with the lowest amounts			1
the research , presented at the @entity274 's annual conference in @entity275 , suggests phthalates are doing psychological , as well as physical , damage			2
in the first study of its kind , dr @entity281 , of the @entity282 in the @entity7 , measured levels of phthalates in the urine of 360 pregnant women in their 20s and 30s			1
she also asked them how often they lost interest in sex in the months leading up to their pregnancy			0
those with the most phthalates in their bodies were two and a half times as likely to say they had frequently lacked interest in sex as those with the least			0
she said : ' it is interesting because these are chemicals that we are all exposed to every day			0
they are throughout our environment and every person studied showed measurable levels			0
' however relationship expert dr @entity307 said many factors can influence a woman 's libido , including smoking , medication , having a baby or changing jobs			2
a spokesman for the @entity316 , which represents manufacturers , said : ' we are not aware of any globally accepted tests which can yet measure the effect chemical exposure may have on libido			0

controversial study *focuses* on phthalate chemicals found in make - up
phthalates are man - made chemicals thought to interfere with hormones
they can be found in everything from cosmetics to shower curtains
@entity7 study found exposure to the highest levels of two phthalate chemicals led to a lowering of @entity16 scores at age seven by more than six points
the scientists claim the link remained after taking account of known factors that can influence child @entity16 , such as the mother 's intelligence
study only looked at 328 cases , and further studies need to be carried out on larger groups to confirm results
