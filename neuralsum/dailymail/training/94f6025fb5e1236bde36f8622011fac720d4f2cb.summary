by @entity0 follow @ @ the_topspin @entity1 is on the outside now , but you would n't necessarily realise it			1
discarded as @entity6 batting coach a few weeks ago , he still talks with the passion and wisdom of a man who cares deeply - and knows no other way			1
when a figure of his stature says that @entity14 cricket needs to shed its conservatism and ' look at the way we 're going to win games ' , it 's both polite to listen and almost counter-intuitive to reflect that he 's no longer involved			1
@entity1 had been passing on his knowledge to the @entity6 dressing - room since late 2009 before he received a call from @entity24 at the end of april informing him that his services were no longer required			1
focused : @entity6 captain @entity24 decided on different approach following @entity29 whitewash before that he was a selector			1
and before that he was @entity6 captain			1
he remains their leading test run scorer , with a tally of 8,900			2
quite simply , an @entity6 dressing - room without @entity1 feels like @entity37 's without @entity38			1
' it was always going to come to an end some time , ' he told @entity41			2
' i 'll be in and around the game , but just not so much hands on			2
i 'll be not so involved with the actual thing i 've been involved with all my life			2
' the clamour for change after @entity6 's winter horror show was always more likely to focus on the batsmen than the bowlers			1
in 10 innings during the @entity29 whitewash , they passed 300 only twice and failed to reach even 180 on six occasions			1
something had to give - and , eventually , that something was @entity1			1
' when you 're getting bowled out in 50 overs , and the side are back in the field quickly , there 's a price to pay , ' he said			1
' that 's the reality			1
day out : @entity24 and golfer @entity68 attend @entity69 day at @entity70 on friday ' @entity71 and @entity24 are quite entitled to make the changes			0
@entity24 has had tough decisions to make			0
in a way that 's good for him because that 's what he had to do			1
he ca n't stand on sentiment			0
' would i like to have left in that way ? no. it was absolutely not in my plan to be sacked by @entity6			1
but i wish them and @entity24 all the best			0
he 's been a good friend , and we 've had a very good relationship down the years			2
it was going to come to an end , obviously , at some stage - probably just a fraction prematurely from my point of view			0
it does n't mean you do n't care about them and want them to do well			0
' chief among @entity1 's hopes for @entity6 's new era - an era which begins with @entity24 's leadership skills squarely under the microscope after the 5 - 0 hammering in @entity102 - is a bolder approach			1
' i was brought up under the captaincy of @entity106 and @entity107 to play the pressing game , ' he said			0
' as a leader you have to try to make things happen			0
' i was never schooled in letting the game unfold and seeing if you come out on top			0
you 've got to take the initiative			0
you 've got to press			0
' hands on : @entity6 head coach @entity71 chats with @entity116 is that something @entity24 should have picked up after going head to head against @entity102 captain @entity120 during the back - to - back @entity29 ? ' we have to look at the way we 're going to win games , ' said @entity1			1
' you have to create the opportunity to win , and fight for it			0
you 've got to push the game forward			0
that 's the only way to play cricket			2
' @entity1 , who was speaking at a chance to shine event in south @entity133 , believes that philosophy should extend to selection			1
@entity6 's 12 - man squad for next week 's first test against @entity138 at @entity139 was named on thursday , and there was no room for @entity142 whose 74 - ball 121 in the one - day series last week prompted many to push him for a test debut			1
the selectors went instead for the tried and tested @entity147			0
and , while @entity1 agrees with that choice , he had encouraging words for @entity142			1
' i would not rule him out as a future keeper , ' he said			0
' not that guys like @entity154 or @entity155 would let you down at all			0
we 've been too conservative			0
@entity6 have to be bolder			1
' departed : @entity1 and former @entity6 coach @entity158 but it 's hard to imagine that @entity1 will be watching anyone more closely than @entity24 , his old protégé both at @entity162 and @entity6 , and a disciple of @entity1 's near - religious emphasis on the importance of the daddy hundred - scores of 150 or more			1
' i 've seen him meet and conquer many challenges over the years , ' he said			0
' but he 's in an interesting position now where he 's got to kick on			2
you can ' t have more of the same			0
he 's got to take these exciting young players forward			2
' he 'll need his experienced players to help be leaders in the dressing - room as well			0
you ca n't just have one captain			0
but he 's also got to be the guy who sets the tone and demands more from the players			2
he 's entitled to demand more			2
you 're playing for your country			0
you 're entitled to demand more to get the best out of them - that 's part of the job as captain			2
' half an hour with @entity1 is enough to convince you that cricket will never leave his bloodstream			1
@entity37 's next week will feel like someone is missing			2
chance to @entity194 ambassador @entity1 was visiting @entity195 in @entity196 for @entity197			1
this week thousands of chance to shine schools all over the country are enjoying cricket - themed activities in the classroom and playground			0
