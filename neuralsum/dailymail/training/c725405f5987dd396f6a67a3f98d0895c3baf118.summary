employment minister @entity0 has laughed off her new title of @entity2 of the @entity4 catwalk as ' fine if it inspires girls to go into politics '			1
the former tv presenter was one of a succession of female mps photographed on the steps of @entity11 yesterday , even though some were taking up more junior roles than men whose promotions were just announced on @entity16			0
speaking after her promotion to now attend @entity18 , miss @entity0 said she could only smile at the coverage that her glamorous appearance had garnered			2
she told @entity21 : ‘ well all i can say is that it 's fantastic having women in powerful positions in the newspapers and if that meant we were walking , the paper might have called it , ' a catwalk ' - we were walking into @entity11			2
they see @entity43 , secretary of state for education , and they ’re thinking " hey that ’s something could do			2
" ’ @entity47 replaced a succession of older male ministers with up - and - coming @entity51 women in an attempt to make his top team more representative of the population			1
although former tv host @entity56 was arguably the star turn in @entity4 , one of the biggest winners was @entity60 , who entered the @entity18 as environment secretary at the age of 38 , making her the youngest female cabinet minister of all time			1
the ice - cool mother - of - two , increasingly tipped as a potential future @entity51 leader , replaced @entity68 , who clashed angrily with the prime minister as he was sacked after criticism of his handling of the horsemeat scandal , a cull of badgers and the winter floods			1
the other major promotion was handed to @entity43 , promoted from @entity77 at the @entity78 to replace @entity79 as @entity80			0
the prime minister declared his new team ‘ reflected modern @entity87 ’ , but faced a backlash from some of the @entity51 old guard who accused him of culling middle - aged male ministers regardless of their merits			1
former tv host @entity56 was hailed the star turn in @entity4 yesterday after her glamorous turn before photographers @entity60 : the new environment secretary is very patriotic in a red , white and blue ensemble consisting of a snake - skin navy dress and red jacket oddly finished with black patent shoes			1
miss @entity60 , 38 , mp for @entity96 and the @entity97 and children minister , looked bright and sensible but a little bit too @entity99 air hostess @entity102 : the minister for planning and coastal communities was alone in braving the no - jacket look - after all she was brave enough to appear on tv in a swimsuit on @entity106 ! this rather tight , bright , purple dress - the £ 115 ' @entity108 ' by @entity109 - makes the most of 41 - year - old miss @entity102 's figure			1
but who knows what 's with the mp for @entity115 's wrinkly nude shoes and big bag ? the new @entity117 is to have her salary topped up by the @entity119 after it emerged she was to be paid less than her male predecessor , @entity120			0
@entity121 was announced as the new @entity123 leader , but there was embarrassment as @entity4 confirmed that she would be paid £ 78,891 a year , compared to £ 101,038 for @entity120			0
after @entity128 criticism , @entity51 sources said it had been decided to boost @entity131 ’s salary using party funds			2
there was particular anger that not one existing woman minister was axed in mr @entity47 ’s biggest clear - out since becoming party leader			1
mps had expected @entity138 , the sports minister , who has made a series of gaffes , to be dismissed , and there were question marks over the future of @entity145 minister @entity144 after she poked fun at the prime minister ’s @entity148 schooling			1
‘ what do you have to do as a woman to get sacked by @entity47 ? ’ asked one ousted minister			2
‘ no matter how hopeless or how provocative you are , you wo n’t get sacked because he has to meet his quotas			0
’ another senior @entity51 complained : ‘ this really is the worst form of tokenistic gesture politics			2
merit is out of the window			0
’ the number of @entity51 women attending @entity18 rose to eight out of 27 , just short of mr @entity47 ’s target of a third of his ministers being women			1
the new women join home secretary @entity165 , international development secretary @entity166 and @entity168 secretary @entity167			0
@entity43 : @entity43 , 41 , mp for @entity170 , and now @entity80 as well as minister for women and equalities , chose a wintry , belted black dress , low nude pumps and a brown jacket with three - quarter - length sleeves that looks like half of another suit			2
at least she looks as if she 's going to the office @entity180 : treasury minister @entity180 , 42 , must be the first person in that post to wear giant polka dots - her dress , from @entity185 favourite @entity184 , costs £ 45 - though that navy jacket looks like @entity188 was its last owner and those sensible shoes could have been worn by @entity191			0
the mp for @entity194 's bag is the more fashion - forward £ 595 ' @entity196 ' by @entity197 the new leader of the @entity123 , @entity198 , and @entity56 have been promoted to join @entity144 in also attending meetings without being full cabinet ministers			0
in an indication of mr @entity47 ’s keenness to highlight the influx of @entity51 women , a succession of female mps was photographed outside no 10 , though some were taking up more junior roles than men whose promotions were announced on @entity16			1
there were new ministerial jobs for @entity212 , @entity180 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity102 , who famously took part in @entity217 ’s celebrity diving programme @entity106 ! @entity218 was made a government whip			0
@entity214 : the new energy department minister looks both contemporary and work - appropriate in her straight - to - work navy suit , white top and bold necklace - although the trousers are a little tight			0
the 50 - year - old mp for @entity227 and @entity228 , a former whip , chose a £ 695 @entity230 tote that seems to have the kitchen sink crammed into it			0
the red nails and i - mean - business glasses in her hand are a nice touch @entity212 : elevated from under - secretary of state at health to the same role at the @entity238 , @entity212 , 57 , always has the air of a mrs @entity191 tribute , fake posh voice , tough manner and everything - and here she is edging towards the helmet hair and forbidding jackets of the @entity191 , modernised by a lower - cut blouse , trousers and a high heeled £ 375 loafer by @entity249			0
the mp for @entity251 's bag looks big enough to conceal a few missiles @entity128 ’s shadow women and equalities minister @entity253 said : ‘ the @entity51 have spent the last few days briefing that this would be the reshuffle which fixed @entity47 ’s “ women problem ” but it ’s turning into a damp squib			1
‘ it ’s clear the @entity51 still wo n’t match the 44 per cent of @entity128 ’s shadow cabinet under @entity260			2
’ veteran cabinet minister @entity188 , who quit the government after four decades at the top of @entity51 politics , expressed support for all - women shortlists as a way to further increase the number of women representing the party			1
the former @entity51 chancellor said the party was ‘ going too slowly ’ in its efforts to boost the number of female candidates , adding : ‘ i would be in favour of all - women shortlists , which i did n’t used to be			1
’ @entity213 : promoted from assistant whip to @entity278 , @entity213 , 50 , hit the high road in similar wedge shoes to @entity0 and a smart navy dress , topped off by a ' statement ' necklace and a bold teal jacket that looked about two sizes too big for the mp for @entity287 lady stowell : the 47 - year - old was the @entity290 in @entity291 and joins the @entity18 as @entity117 and chancellor of the @entity293 , but she 's a bit mother - of - the - bride in this outfit by @entity297			1
the line is sold in @entity299 where the dress is £ 129 and the jacket £ 159 @entity302 , who was @entity303 secretary in mr @entity47 ’s first @entity18 , said : ‘ do n’t forget the prime minister only has 49 women out of all his troops to pick from			1
he has a finite pool from which to choose			0
‘ i think he has picked some very good people who have been here for four years and therefore have got some good political experience under their belts			0
‘ i wish all of those women well — not just the ones that have gone in but also the ones that have been doing very , very good jobs for this government			0
