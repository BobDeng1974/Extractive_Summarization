by @entity0 published : 07:12 est , 30 may 2013 updated : 03:29 est , 31 may 2013 a mother - of - two whose quest for the perfect bottom led to a quadruple limb and buttock amputation has warned other women against black market silicone injections			1
hair stylist @entity9 , from @entity10 , spent five years in excruciating pain when an unlicensed practitioner injected her buttocks with bathroom sealant , telling her it was silicone , in order to enhance them			1
doctors had no idea how to treat the botched implants and told her she might have to live with the agony , but when they finally operated the injections became so badly infected she was induced into a coma			1
it was only when she awoke two months later that @entity9 , now 46 , discovered the lengths medical staff had gone to to keep her alive			1
she said : ' i thought she was a blessing			2
i had n't done any other research so i did n't know all the horror stories			2
i went to someone 's private home - she was n't licensed , but i did n't know that then - and lay on her daughter 's bed , wearing special panties with the butt removed			1
' she told me i 'd need four sets of injections , and when she started to do them it was very painful			1
i could feel it going into my nerves and muscles			2
' the pain did subside , and @entity9 returned for a second lot of injections			1
it was as she left the house the second time that she had ' an epiphany '			0
' i thought , what are you doing ? and that was a sign from @entity43 to stop			0
' soon after , things began to go dramatically wrong			0
first the area around the injections began to discolour , then become itchy , then incredibly painful , described by @entity9 as ' like a toothache , labour pain and a migraine '			1
she sought medical advice and the general consensus was that doctors had no idea what to do			1
@entity82 told her the chemical could not be removed and that she would have to live with the pain			1
' eventually they went in and removed the silicone , along with the butt cheeks , ' said @entity9			1
' it was then it became infected and they gave me 24 hours to live			1
i remember feeling relieved when i heard that			0
' doctors induced @entity9 into a coma and carried out 27 operations , including a buttock amputation and a quadruple lower arm and lower leg amputation			1
' i did n't know this until i came around , ' she said			0
' when i woke up i had no butt and i was n't in pain anymore			1
' @entity9 taliking to @entity33 and @entity103 live via satellite link on @entity35 's @entity34 @entity9 said : ' when i got the injections i already had great self esteem			1
i thought i was just enhancing myself			0
but looking back , i see there must have been an extreme issue ' @entity9 , who recently completed a three - mile walk , 10 - mile cycle and 150m swim for charity , said she wishes to use the experience to teach other women about the dangers of vanity			1
she said : ' i do n't think @entity43 gives you opportunity to live again without using it to stop others			1
i want to teach that we must n't ever look for something outside ourselves to validate ourselves			0
' we 're already born whole and perfect and complete , and nothing we do on the outside will make us change on the inside			0
' when i got the injections i already had great self esteem			1
i thought i was just enhancing myself			0
but looking back , i see there must have been an extreme issue			0
' a @entity132 student died after jetting to @entity133 for an illegal ' butt enhancement ' operation in the hopes that having a shapelier backside would make her a hip - hop star			1
@entity140 , 20 , hoped buttock implants would make her a hip - hop star @entity144 , 20 , believed a ' bigger booty ' would help in her quest to appear in more music videos , her distraught friends claimed following her death in february 2011			1
one even revealed the aspiring dancer - stagename @entity151 - was dropped from one shoot because directors discovered she had been wearing padded trousers to help enlarge her bottom			2
talent scout @entity156 , who met the university student when she filmed a video , told @entity159 : ' she was a dancer and choreographer			0
' the problem was she did n't have no butt , and she wanted a butt			0
' she went to audition for one video shoot wearing fake booty pants and she got all the attention			0
' but when they found out it was fake she did n't get asked back			0
' he described her as ' victim ' of social pressure to be perfect and thought a larger bottom would make her famous			0
' the @entity175 student developed chest pains and struggled for breath 12 hours after she had the illegal silicone injections at a budget hotel			1
she was taken to hospital but could not be saved			0
a preliminary examination found the silicone filler had leaked into her bloodstream , leading to heart failure			2
@entity186 detectives are investigating whether she was treated with cheap ‘ industrial ’ silicone , normally used as a sealant , rather than medical - grade material used in breast implant surgery			1
pressure : she was dropped from one shoot because directors discovered she had been wearing padded trousers to help enlarge her bottom			0
aspiring dancer : friends claimed miss @entity144 was the victim of social pressure to have a larger bottom it was not the first time miss @entity144 had had the procedure			0
she is believed to have been treated in november 2010 - her 2011 injection may have been a ' top - up ' procedure			2
accompanied by three friends , she travelled from @entity151 to @entity205 for the treatment , thought to have been an early present to herself for her 21st birthday bootylicious : @entity210 has become almost as famous for her posterior as for her voice but a day later she was dead			0
buttock enhancement surgery is becoming popular in the @entity186 , among women who aspire to the shapely curves of @entity216 , @entity217 and singer @entity210			2
@entity210 has become almost as famous for her posterior as for her voice , and rumours have spread across the web that the @entity222 singer underwent surgery or uses pads to boost her bum , especially on urban gossip sites such as @entity227 and mediatakeout.com			0
she , however denies having had surgery			0
the illusion of a larger backside has become increasingly more fashionable among young women since the rise of the ' @entity234 ' phenomenon			2
a bigger behind has become almost a prerequisite for any aspiring dancer wanting to make it on the music video scene			0
but the hip hop industry has come under fire for objectifying women in music videos where dancers - or @entity246 - chasing fame can often leave themselves open to financial and sexual exploitation			1
and in their desperation to beat off the competition , many resort to surgery to get ahead			0
' top up ' procedures are only legal when the silicone gel is contained and sealed within an implant			2
but illegal injections of the material are also widely available from unlicensed back - room medics			1
one expert said having a direct injection of silicone gel - long outlawed in the @entity186 and @entity132 , even for breast surgery - is ' like playing @entity264 roulette '			1
miss @entity144 and her friends flew to @entity205 and paid around £ 100 for the room			0
miss @entity144 's buttock injections are thought to have cost around £ 1,300 - while her friend had the same procedure along with a hip enhancement treatment			1
the ' doctor ' who injected the silicone left soon after and was not there when miss @entity144 began complaining of chest pains			2
paramedics were called to the hotel and she was taken to @entity278 hospital where she died 90 minutes after being admitted			0
dr @entity279 , president - elect of the @entity280 , said : ‘ buttock augmentation is n’t a very commonly done procedure here , which is probably why these girls have resorted to going abroad			2
' if correctly done , it involves implanting solid silicone implants into the buttock just like breast implants			2
@entity288 , consultant plastic surgeon at the @entity289 in @entity151 , warned against going overseas for such treatments young women are taking enormous risks in pursuit of a smoother , rounder bottom , an expert said			2
@entity288 , consultant plastic surgeon at the @entity289 in @entity151 , warned against going overseas for such treatments			0
' bottom augmentation is becoming more popular and originated in @entity133 , in places like @entity298 , ' he said			0
' more and more people are coming forward in the @entity132 for this procedure			0
' a a former @entity301 , @entity302 , died at 38 in 2010 after a buttocks - enhancement procedure at a medical clinic in @entity305			1
mr @entity288 said he had dealt with two patients who suffered problems after receiving silicone jabs overseas			2
' the problems are two fold , ' he said			0
' firstly , if you use a low volume amount of silicone it can promote rejection - the body trying to ward it off			1
that causes a long - term abscess which can damage the surrounding tissue			1
' elsewhere in the world it has been reported to cause problems with pulmonary embolism , a blood clot to the lungs , which may have happened in this most recent case			0
' the @entity327 says the safety of the use of liquid injectable silicone for cosmetic purposes is controversial , and should not be used outside legitimately approved clinical trials .			2
