bad decision : half of @entity3 's gold reserves were sold for £ 2bn in 1999 by @entity4 the gold reserves held by @entity3 that were disastrously sold off by @entity4 would be worth six times as much today at £ 11bn , the chancellor revealed in his budget speech today			1
@entity10 said that the @entity11 had been rebuilding the country 's reserves of the precious metal after former chancellor brown sold them in 1999			1
the decision to sell half of @entity3 's reserves when the price of gold was at a 20 - year low low caused stinging criticism of the man who succeeded @entity25 as prime minister			1
@entity4 sold the gold for £ 2bn when gold was valued at just $ 300 an ounce			1
the sale came shortly before bullion started a blistering rally that took prices to a record high of $ 1,920.30 an ounce in september 2011			1
the same gold reserves would be worth £ 11bn today			1
the chancellor said in his budget speech today : ' we are also taking the opportunity to rebuild @entity3 's reserves , which had fallen to historically low levels			2
' i can confirm our gold holdings have risen in value to £ 11 billion			0
this does not include the 400 or so tonnes of gold sold a decade ago for £ 2 billion , and which would now be worth six times that at over £ 13 billion pounds			2

right , former chancellor @entity4 mr @entity4 's decision to sell the gold when he was @entity37 is regarded as one of the @entity53 's worst financial mistakes and has cost taxpayers almost £ 7 billion			2
despite repeated campaigns to shed light on the issues , mr @entity4 and the @entity53 have repeatedly refused to give any information about the sale amid allegations that warnings were ignored			0
the issue also blighted @entity75 's general election campaign and underpinned claims that they had mismanaged the economy			0
@entity10 said at the time : ' @entity4 's decision to sell off our gold reserves at the bottom of the market cost the @entity3 taxpayer billions of pounds			1
it was one of the worst economic judgements ever made by a chancellor			0

the documents should be published immediately			0
