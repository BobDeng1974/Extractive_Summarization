by @entity0 while most of the tech world has been focused on forthcoming smartwatches , one man has invested a ring that can tell the time			2
the @entity6 is the brainchild of @entity8 and tells users the time when they twist it on their finger			1
made of stainless steel , the timepiece was developed by the 26 - year - old @entity15 as an alternative watch for people who do not like wearing anything around their wrists			1
made of stainless steel , the timepiece was developed by the 26 - year - old @entity15 as an alternative watch for people who do not like wearing anything around their wrists the clock is composed of three bands that rotate around the master ring to tell the time , with the largest band tracking the hours , the centre one showing the minutes and the thinnest one dots to show the seconds			1
to tell the time , users twist the watch and the time displays for one minute using led lights in either blue or orange			1
his team has been fine - tuning the design as well as the technology and has set its sights on being eco-friendly			2

mr @entity65 said : ' i wanted to create something that is innovative , good to look at and can actually be useful			0
' i never wore a watch on my wrist because i do n’t like the feeling , but i like watches in general			1
the ring measures just three millimetres in thickness so it is no larger than most ordinary statement rings and they can be custom - fitted ' so i used that opportunity to let my mind come up with something that i could wear - the @entity6			1

mr @entity65 said the watch will go on sale in april next year and horologists can get their hands on one for £ 120 if they pre-order as the device will cost £ 135 afterwards			1
currently the ring needs to be charged using a wireless power pad which comes with the jewellery , but in the future there are plans to power it using kinetic energy @entity99 spokesman @entity98 , 38 , from @entity100 , @entity101 , said : “ what they ’ll get is the opportunity to be one of the first people in the world to own this most innovative and beautiful gadget			1
' initially we thought that it would be people like us , lovers of technology , but it ’s still early on and it appears this has cross-demographic appeal which we are particularly pleased about			0
' the colours hopefully appeal to male and female wearers and with the variety of sizes available it should be gender neutral			0
the watch will go on sale in april next year and horologists can get their hands on one for £ 120 if they pre-order as the device will cost £ 135 afterwards challenges and obstacles still remain , such as powering it with kinetic energy , but mr @entity98 is confident they ’ll be overcome in time			1
he said : ' that is going to be a huge challenge for the team to enable the technology to work within such a small confined area			0
' @entity137 is expected to unveil its @entity138 in @entity139 today , but doom - saying analysts are already predicting poor sales and a lack of enthusiasm for the technology			0
the @entity146 company could be the first major smartphone manufacturer to release a device that resembles a smartphone worn on the wrist , although other , similar devices such as the @entity152 and @entity153 are already on sale			0
by being the first to launch , @entity137 would beat @entity155 's @entity156 - rumoured to be coming out in @entity157 next year - to the market			2
according to the filing @entity137 's @entity138 range will be ' wearable digital electronic devices in the form of a wristwatch , wrist band or bangle capable of providing access to the @entity167 and for sending and receiving phone calls			2
' it is thought the wristband will also be used for ' storage and / or transmission of data and messages and for keeping track of or managing personal information ; smart phones ; tablet computers ; portable computers			0
' images leaked by technology site @entity182 claims to show a prototype @entity138 , pictured with a 3 - inch touchscreen			0
the site also claims it has a @entity187 camera in the strap , voice commands , preloaded @entity191 apps for tracking fitness , health and connecting with social networks as well as call logs when synced with an @entity191 phone .			0

a @entity15 inventor developed the @entity6 as he likes watches , but could not wear one as he *dislikes* anything around his wrists
@entity8 's @entity6 will be sold next year and works by users twisting the watch so that the time displays for one minute using led lights
it is currently charged using a wireless mat , but in the future its creator hopes it will be powered *solely* by kinetic energy to be more eco-friendly
