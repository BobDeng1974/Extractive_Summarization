the rsvp has been sent , the hotel booked and transport arranged , so the only thing left is — whisper it — the outfit			1
with july upon us , the month that sees more weddings than any other , chances are there ’s still some what - do - i - wear panic among the less organised of us — especially as ceremonies are getting ever more elaborate , and held in increasingly unusual locations			1
here , @entity16 fashion editor @entity15 shows you how to dress , whatever the occasion			1
so , pair kitten heels with a floppy hat			1
a short jacket will protect you from gusty conditions and these jolly stripes give a nice nod to nautical			0
a chic dress with sparkly accessories gives understated glamour			2
the embellised @entity38 band is a relaxed alternative to a hat or fascinator			2
here 's quintessential @entity43 style — a classic hat and dress			1
as the least formal type of wedding , you can get away with a strappy dress and bare shoulders			2
you do n’t have to have a hat , but it could be useful to shield you from the sun. try something modern for a service in the city , like this tailored jumpsuit			0
you ’ll need to look smart , so wear a statement hat and a jacket			0
say goodbye to stiletto heels for this relaxed affair : a pair of metallic flats add just the right amount of glamour to a pretty mesh dress			0
evening event a black tie evening wedding is usually dressy			0
this calls for a sleek silhouette and glittering accessories			0
do n’t choose a hemline that stops above the knee , because this is the occasion for a floor - skimming gown			0
hats or fascinators should be avoided — a statement necklace or glittery hair slide works better instead .			1

with most weddings being held in july , you need to be prepared
