the family of beheaded @entity2 photojournalist @entity1 are facing fresh agony after sick @entity5 militants tried to sell them his headless body for $ 1million , according to a new report by @entity9			1
the website spoke to three middlemen trying to broker the deal , who say they can prove the body is @entity1 's with a dna swab and will deliver the remains across the @entity18 border once the ransom has been paid			2
@entity1 was the first @entity2 hostage to be beheaded by an @entity22 militant in a graphic video recording this summer			1
since august , the terrorist group overtaking large swathes of @entity26 and @entity27 , has beheaded two more @entity2 and a @entity28 in similar displays of barbarism			0
the photojournalist was executed by the terrorist group this past summer , in a highly - graphic video recording ( still from the video above ) victim : @entity1 was kidnapped from a cafe in a northwestern @entity26 town on november 22 , 2012			1
he was working as a photojournalist covering the civil war at the time the three middlemen interviewed by @entity9 include a @entity26 rebel fighter , a businessman and an official for the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) , the @entity2 - backed rebel group helping to fight @entity22 in the civil war - torn country			1
the rebel fighter , who also claimed to have connections to @entity53 ( @entity54 's @entity26 affiliate ) , called his work ' a humanity case ' since he believes returning the body to @entity1 's parents will help bring them closure			0
' they ask for $ 1 million , and they will send dna to @entity18 , but they want the money first , ' he said			0
' they will not give the dna without the money			0
' but the @entity49 official warned @entity9 against publishing the article , believing the @entity2 government would shut the deal down if they found out			2
@entity1 was one of 23 @entity72 hostages held by @entity22 earlier this year			2
fifteen of the hostages were freed when their respective @entity75 governments paid millions of dollars in ransoms , but the @entity78 and @entity2 hostages were left behind since neither country negotiates with terrorists			2
next offer : before @entity1 was executed , @entity22 allegedly offered to release him if his family paid a $ 132million ransom , but the amount was not paid since the @entity2 does not negotiate with terrorists			1
@entity1 's parents @entity86 and @entity88 speak after the video depicting his beheading was released in august it was previously reported that before @entity1 's death , his family was approached by the group with a $ 132million ransom to secure their son 's release , but that @entity2 officials made it clear that if they paid the ransom themselves it would be an act of treason			1
' it will be like a shame for the @entity2 government , ' the @entity49 official said , of selling the body			0
' people will ask why you brought the body but you did nâ€™t bring him when he was alive			0
' the @entity1 family have not yet commented on the story , and the @entity114 told @entity9 ' we are seeking more information '			1
holding @entity72 captives for ransom is one of the main ways terrorists groups like @entity22 raise money			0
a @entity124 report published this year found that @entity54 has made at least $ 125million from ransoms since 2008 , with $ 66million raised in 2013 alone .			0

three middlemen *confirmed* the proposed deal to @entity9
@entity114 says they are ' seeking more information '
@entity1 was the first of three @entity2 hostages to be beheaded by a *masked* @entity22 militant in a graphic video - taped recording released in august
