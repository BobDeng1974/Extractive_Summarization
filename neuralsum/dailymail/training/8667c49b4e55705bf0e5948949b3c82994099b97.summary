the threat of a global pandemic remains one of the most serious threats to the future of the human race , but now scientists have developed a breakthrough system for predicting how rapidly an outbreak might spread and where			1
where once disease typically spread by people traveling distances on foot or by horse , modern pandemics are spread through a complex network of global flight patterns and busy aviation hubs			1
by using data from the 2003 @entity25 outbreak and the 2009 @entity27 pandemic , theoretical physicist @entity20 and his colleagues have devised a new model for predicting the arrival times of the next global pandemic in different parts of the world			1
‘ in the modern world that ’s so connected , old school , conventional geographic distance is not so meaningful anymore			0
he and his colleagues have spent the past decade testing how ‘ effective distance ’ might work by building theoretical pandemics and models that predict their theoretical spread			2
three - years - worth of airline data was analyzed to see how these distances interact with the aim of developing a universal equation that would account for the arrival times of any disease across the globe			0
as the outbreak continues to impact different parts of the world the pattern on the left remains regular - similar to waves created by dropping a stone in water @entity20 have found that contagion now travels much more quickly and effectively between busy airports in different countries rather than between cities and more rural areas in the same country @entity20 has discovered that the jumbled , erratic spread of disease , right , can be reduced to simple , constant wave patterns , left , riding on effective distances , rather than geographic ones , through a ' global mobility network ' @entity20 and his co-author @entity106 published a paper in @entity108 today , which shows that the jumbled , erratic spread of disease can be reduced to simple , constant wave patterns , riding on effective distances , rather than geographic ones , through a ‘ global mobility network			1
’ when @entity20 plotted the @entity25 and @entity27 epidemics ’ actual arrival times in different cities against their effective distances , he found strong positive correlations			1
‘ so we do n’t need to know anything about the disease , ’ @entity20 explained			2
‘ if you throw a rock into the water , you ’ll see a concentric wave			0
if you throw a big rock into the water , you will also see a concentric wave			0
if you throw a rock into honey , or some different liquid , you will see a wave that is propagating slower , but it will still be a concentric wave			0
’ regardless of the transmission method , @entity20 contends that his global mobility network represents the wave pattern , while the rock and the liquid show the launch and spread of the disease			1
using the global mobility network , we can see how a disease launched in one city might spread to the rest of the world			2
@entity20 developed visualizations of this phenomenon in @entity147 , @entity148 , and @entity149			2
unfortunately , they also show how difficult it would be to contain or quarantine an outbreak in a global city			0
although now that researchers understand how the underlying process works , it could be used to help cut off critical links in transmission .			0

scientists have developed a system for predicting how rapidly a global pandemic might spread and where
where once disease would have spread by people traveling by foot or by horse , modern pandemics spread through a complex network of global flight patterns and busy aviation hubs
theoretical physicist @entity20 has found that epidemics spread in a pattern much like the waves created by dropping a stone in water
now that scientists understand this , the breakthrough could be used to help try and cut off the global spread of future pandemics
