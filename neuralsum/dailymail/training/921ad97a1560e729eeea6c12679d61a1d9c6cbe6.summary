as a series of @entity16 - linked car bombs and suicide blasts in @entity18 marked the tenth anniversary of the @entity21 - led invasion , the @entity9 peer , who served as deputy prime minister at the time of the war , said he now fears the invasion was legally wrong			0
he told @entity25 ’s @entity24 programme that while ‘ shock and awe may have got rid of @entity27 ... it certainly never brought peace ’			1
former deputy prime minister @entity1 , now @entity29 , @entity1 has raised questions about the legality of the @entity32 in an interview tonight then prime minister @entity5 is watched by his then deputy @entity1 ( left ) as he addresses the @entity34 a year after the invasion in 2004			1
mr @entity5 stated that @entity36 has no plans to increase the number of its troops in @entity3 lord @entity1 said : ‘ you have to ask yourself , ten years on , was it justified and was it really about regime change ? and if it was about regime change , i ’m afraid that does n’t make it legal			1
’ his criticism is significant as he was one of mr @entity5 ’s most loyal cabinet ministers			2
he said mr @entity5 ’s strategy for @entity3 in 2003 had been shaped by his successful interventions in @entity52 and @entity53			1
but lord @entity1 said he was now alarmed at mr @entity5 ’s calls for regime change in @entity8 , and @entity7 , as it is taking steps to acquire nuclear weapons			1
‘ he wants to do it now in @entity7 , possibly , and @entity8			0
’ lord @entity1 's comments came as former prime minister @entity5 defended the decision to invade on march 19 , 2003 , with the @entity21 by saying @entity3 would have suffered a bloody revolution anyway			1
during the invasion and its aftermath , 179 @entity36 service men and women were killed			1

three days after this advice was given to the @entity78 - and without any debate on it by ministers , @entity36 and @entity21 troops moved in			2
it led to @entity36 's biggest ever political protest as more than one million protesters took to the streets of @entity87 to try to stop @entity36 participation in the war			2
asked whether he regretted the invasion , lord @entity1 told @entity25 's @entity24 programme : ' i think you have to start from the beginning to the end			0
it 's 10 years - time to look at those decisions			0
' right at the beginning we were hoping to get the @entity101 resolution			0
' there were other matters we agreed to , not least of all the road map with @entity106 and the @entity108 - @entity107 , all those things were not achieved and we can see now that in the shock and awe , we may have got rid of @entity27 , but it certainly never brought peace			1

' and you have to ask yourself 10 years on was it justified and was it really about regime change ? and if it was about regime change , i 'm afraid that did n't make it legal			2
' asked if he had doubt in his mind at the time that the invasion was about weapons of mass destruction , @entity1 said : ' i think the weapons of mass destruction , @entity5 certainly believed that			2
' @entity182 [ @entity27 ] had used gas against people			0
so this was a terrible man			0
but at the end of the day , you have to ask yourself was it legitimate to go in ? ' asked if he feels responsible , lord @entity1 told @entity25 : ' of course i 've got a share in the responsibility			0
it was quite clear from the discussions that @entity5 and @entity106 were having that he was quite prepared to go into @entity3 without the support if necessary			1
' today @entity5 , the prime minister at the time , spoke out to justify his decision to invade by saying @entity27 would have been overthrown anyway , and it would have been a ' lot worse than @entity8 '			1
mr @entity5 told the @entity198 : ' i certainly think that if @entity27 had still been in power , its true there would have been , probably , an uprising among his people			2
' but i think it would have been a lot more like @entity8 and probably a lot worse than @entity8			0
' lord @entity1 's comments go further than the previous doubts he has expressed over the @entity32			2
in 2009 he admitted in the @entity209 magazine that he wondered how he had agreed to go along with @entity36 's participation in the war			2
a year later he gave evidence to the @entity213 , when he revealed he had doubts about the intelligence on @entity27 's weapons programmes before the invasion			0
earlier this week , lord @entity1 told the @entity218 why he supported the war a decade ago			0
he said : ' my support for action in @entity3 was justified by certain conditions , as @entity223 agreed			1
the first was that any agreement to go to war had to be backed by @entity101 resolutions			0
' secondly , i wanted to make sure that it was not about regime change			0
@entity27 needed to observe the previous 17 @entity101 resolutions on his development of @entity232			0
' thirdly , @entity106 had to give an agreement to implement a road map for a two - state solution for @entity108 and the @entity237 ­ territories			0
and finally , our own @entity238 had to back military action			0
' lord @entity1 admitted that when his government only achieved approval mr @entity5 continued because he believed the war was ' justifiable '			2
in the @entity21 , former vice president @entity244 says he has no regrets about the @entity32 and would do it again ' in a minute ' in a new documentary which airs tonight			0
in the film entitled @entity249 according to @entity244 , @entity244 says he ' feels good about ' the @entity21 led action which has cost the lives of 4,488 @entity21 armed service members and 134,000 @entity3 civilians			1
he also defends the use of torture in the wake of 9/11 including the controversial technique of simulated drowning or water - boarding in the @entity261 film .			0
