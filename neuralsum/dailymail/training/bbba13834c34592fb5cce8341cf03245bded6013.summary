former referee and @entity2 columnist @entity0 believes refereeing is at the worst level he can remember the body which represents @entity7 refs has hit back following stinging critcism from former referees ' boss @entity9			1
@entity9 has called for his successor @entity11 to be removed from his position with @entity13 ( @entity13 ) and labelled the current crop of officials as the ' worst that we have seen ' , citing ' over 20 major errors ' during the @entity19 period			1
the 70 - year - old said @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 should be stood down at the end of the season and @entity27 removed from his position should he fail a fitness test			1
referees ' chief @entity11 ( pictured ) should be removed from his position , says former boss @entity9 @entity9 watches a game at @entity33 ( left ) and during his days as a top - flight referee ( right ) @entity13 would not respond directly but released statistics showing standards had improved in every available measure in the five years since @entity9 left the organisation			1
these include accuracy on major decisions , up to 95 per cent from 94.1 per cent , on decisions in the penalty box ( 98 per cent ) and offsides , 99 per cent compared to 92 per cent five years ago when @entity11 took over			1
@entity9 's attack was made on his website , which also sells refereeing kits and equipment and offers training courses			1
the @entity13 is standing firm , however , confident it has taken the right path since @entity9 's departure and that it is backed up by all the statistics			1
there are usually periods in every season where a series of controversial decisions puts the spotlight on to officials , and has led to football 's lawmakers to begin to consider video replays			1
that will be debated at the @entity64 at its next meeting in @entity66 on february 28 , though any final decision is likely to be a couple of years away with trials being needed first			0
@entity13 's latest figures show referees ' fitness has improved , especially in terms of sprints			2
@entity22 , pictured with @entity76 's @entity75 , is one of four officials @entity9 wants stood down @entity21 discusses a decision with @entity80 boss @entity79 at @entity81 's @entity21 awarded @entity82 two controversial penalties for handball - both of which were scored - against @entity87 at @entity88			1
@entity24 failed to show @entity89 forward @entity90 a straight red card after he brought down @entity76 's @entity75 as his side 's last man			0
@entity90 only received a booking			0
@entity22 only gave @entity80 defender @entity95 a yellow card despite a flying kick into the back of @entity76 's @entity99			0
@entity23 gave @entity101 's @entity100 a straight red card for handball against @entity104 , despite no clear angle showing that @entity107 's shot was going on target			0
writing on his ' you are the ref ' blog , @entity9 has called for wide - ranging action to change @entity13 , with the first course of action to ' dispense with the services of the current @entity13 general manager '			1
' one thing is certain : @entity13 can not continue without a fundamental review of its operations , ' he wrote			0
' the @entity13 is failing in its aim to deliver excellence on the field			0
' and @entity9 agrees with former referee @entity0 's scathing opinion that performances have been reached a new low			2
' this season we have all witnessed many disastrous performances and big game - changing errors , ' @entity9 added			1
' i share the view of one former top referee that the current group of professional referees is the worst that we have seen			2
' the latest big game decision error was the stupid dismissal of @entity139 of @entity140 who himself was on the receiving end of a reckless challenge			2
' it is unbelievable that a so - called top referee should make such a mistake			2
' it is my view that the board of the @entity13 should return to its original constitution with the chief executives of @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity7 reviewing the current @entity13 operation			2
' @entity24 , pictured booking @entity87 's @entity155 , has also come in for criticism from @entity9 referee @entity23 shows @entity140 goalkeeper @entity157 a red card against @entity104 in december @entity9 wants @entity27 ( centre ) to be stood down if he fails to pass a fitness test @entity139 's red card , which was shown by @entity162 , was later overturned by the @entity152 and , while @entity162 was not on @entity9 's list for the chop , he was scathing in his assessment of @entity11			1
' i am criticising very strongly , ' he told @entity167			0
' if the guy is at the bottom of the league then his job is at risk			0
at this moment in time he ( @entity11 ) is more than bottom			2
' i am seeing a regression			0
the performances of the referees are not acceptable			0
he must carry the responsibility			0
' he added : ' ultimately , at the end of the day , i do n't think they 're bad referees , i just think they need some leadership and guidance and help at this stage to improve performances on the field of play			0

@entity9 has called the current officials the ' worst we have seen '
@entity11 should be removed from his position , according to @entity9
he wants four officials stood down at the end of the season
@entity9 also wants to see @entity27 pass a fitness test
