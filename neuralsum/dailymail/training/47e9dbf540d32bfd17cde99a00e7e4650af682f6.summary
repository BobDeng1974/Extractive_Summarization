a flurry of solar flares has been spotted on the sun by a @entity4 telescope			1
in just one day more than half a dozen were spotted , in addition to several ejections of material			2
videos and images show the explosions in all their glory as material races from the sun ’s surface into the surrounding space			2
the two larger flares were m - class ( moderate ) flares and the others were smaller flares			2
this animation shows an ejection associated with the flares solar flares can damage satellites and have an enormous financial cost			1
astronauts are not in immediate danger because of the relatively low orbit of this manned mission			0
they do have to be concerned about cumulative exposure during space walks			0
the charged particles can also threaten airlines by disturbing the @entity41 ’s magnetic field			2
very large flares can even create currents within electricity grids and knock out energy supplies			0
a positive aspect , from an aesthetic point of view , is that the auroras are enhanced			0
geomagnetic storms are more disruptive now than in the past because of our greater dependence on technical systems that can be affected by electric currents			0
the event was captured by @entity4 ’s @entity18 from 25 to 26 august			1
two larger flares seen were moderate explosions known as m - class flares , while the others were smaller flares			0
some of the images were taken in a wavelength of extreme ultraviolet light , which is ideal for observing flares			0
the eruptions began with an explosive mid-level @entity67 flare			0
the flares originated from a sunspot called @entity70 , an intense region of magnetic activity on the sun ’s surface			1
solar flares are powerful bursts of radiation , but thanks to @entity41 ’s atmosphere they pose little threat to people on the planet ’s surface			1
however intense flares can be known to disrupt satellites in @entity41 orbit			1
periods of intense solar activity can result in bigger and more visible auroras , as more solar wind interacts with particles in the atmosphere			1
the flare under study can be seen on the middle - left of the sun in this image			0
solar flares are releases of intense high - energy radiation from the sun , which we see as a bright light			1
they are sometimes accompanied by an emission of material known as a coronal mass ejections ( @entity108 ) one of the flares as spotted by @entity4 's @entity18 ( @entity18 ) can be seen up close here			1
periods of intense solar activity can result in bigger and more visible auroras , as more solar wind interacts with particles in @entity41 's atmosphere according to @entity115 ’s @entity114 this particular event , while impressive , the flares did n’t pose much threat to our planet			1
‘ given the location of this event , the associated coronal mass ejection is well off the sun - @entity41 line and no significant geomagnetic storming is anticipated as a result , ’ they reported			1
‘ @entity125 had a history of m - class flare production on its previous rotation			0
‘ this event is indicative of an uptick in activity from relatively quiet conditions as of late , though			0
‘ the sun is currently peppered with relatively small regions , all of which are unlikely producers of severe activity at this time			2
’ @entity4 's @entity18 ( @entity18 ) , artist 's illustration shown , has has been in a distant @entity41 orbit since 11 february 2010			1
it will observe the sun until at least 2015 , after which its mission could be extended			0
its goal is to understand the influence of the sun on @entity41 and surrounding space by monitoring its atmosphere			2

@entity4 *researchers* in @entity150 say the sun has gone through a period of **increased** solar activity
more than six solar flares were spotted by the @entity18
the medium - sized and small flares were all unleashed in just one day
the **increased** activity poses no threat to people on @entity41 's surface
but flares can increase the size and reach of auroras from the poles
