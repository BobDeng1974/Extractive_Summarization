her vicious attack on a tow company clerk was not @entity4 's first brush with conflict			1
the disgraced @entity7 sports reporter has been suspended for a week after footage emerged of her telling single mother - of - three @entity9 : ' i 'm on tv and you 're in a f --- ing trailer , honey			1
' but just a month earlier she used similar language to berate an @entity19 attorney and women 's rights campaigner on @entity21			1
@entity22 , who tweets with the handle @ cupcakesarenice , remarked to her followers that she felt uneasy about the way female sports reporters are sexualized on screen			1
her observation infuriated @entity4 in a fight that ended with the reporter raging : ' you sound really bitter			1
if you work as hard as you say you do , you would n't bash more successful ppl on twitter			1
' @entity21 fight : @entity22 ( left ) , a lawyer from @entity19 , tweeted about how female sports reporters are sexualized - and was met with a tirade of anger from @entity4 ( right ) despite not tagging her in the tweet @entity40 of the conversation on march 12 have been posted on @entity22 's blog			1
it started when @entity22 wrote to her followers : ' i wish there were more women in sports broadcasting that are n't completely sexualized			1
' i 'm tired of seeing all sexualized photos of @entity49 in my newsfeed			2
i have no idea if she 's talented , but i know how she 's branded			0
' i have nothing against beautiful women being in sports media , ' she wrote , ' i just wish that they were presented as professionals and not models			0
' a follower responded by mentioning @entity4 's name - and the situation rapidly escalated			2
although they did not tag @entity4 in the tweet , the 28 - year - old reporter found it and began berating @entity22			1
despite having written her own blog post condemning sexualization in @entity73 adverts , @entity4 seemed angered by the suggestion that female sports reporters might be sexualized			1
she raged : ' went to northwestern & played competitive sports			0
what 's wrong w / a woman wanting to look nice & be intelligent ? ' @entity22 responded : ' i have zero issue with beautiful women in sports media			1
what i have issue with is how they are sexualized			0
' @entity4 hit back : ' define that ? i modeled & still graduated in 3 yrs w / a masters			2
those things do n't have to be mutually exclusive			0
' to clarify her point , @entity22 sent @entity4 a link to the definition of ' sexualization '			1
@entity4 was not satisfied : ' personally i believe it 's ppl who do n't have 1 trait or the other who try to demean others , ' adding , ' so you 're being more of a hater than the men themselves ? ' in a bid to extract herself from the back - and - forth , @entity22 tweeted her exasperation to her followers : ' man , i swear i ca n't give an opinion without some rando on @entity21 seeking me out and bashing their misinterpretation			1
' the comment prompted @entity4 's final scathing words , which echo the abuse she level at the tow company clerk on april 6			1
' technically given the two of us , you 're the rando , ' @entity4 tweeted , adding : ' you sound really bitter			1
if you work as hard as you say you do , you would n't bash more successful ppl on twitter			1
' her stance was at odds with a blog post she wrote in january , aiming to champion women 's rights			2
in it , @entity4 describes a cheeseburger advert that features an almost naked woman , writing : ' when so many females fight for gender equality in pay and opportunity – still to this day in 2015 – an advertisement like that only sets women back generations			1
' ' women , ' she pontificates , ' can be comfortable in their own skin ... be the woman with a voice , not the sex - ed up body without one			0
' but after the release of the towing company 's surveillance footage , many have questioned how strongly she feels about equality between women			0
the @entity21 tirade bore surprising similarities with her attack against single mother - of - three @entity154 in @entity156 , @entity157 , on @entity158			2
@entity4 had left her car in the parking lot of @entity163 restaurant @entity161 overnight , despite obvious signs warning that cars would be towed			2
when her vehicle was removed , @entity4 went to the towing station and made her irritation plain			2
she fumes at @entity9 : ' i ’m in the news , sweetheart , i will f --- ing sue this place			1
' the parking attendant can be heard in the video warning @entity4 she is being filmed and threatens to ' play your video '			2
@entity4 seems unfussed , responding : ' that ’s why i have a degree and you do n't - i would n't work in a scumbag place like this			1
' makes my skin crawl even being here			0
' caught red - faced : incredibly , @entity4 was warned that she was being filmed at the start of her ugly rant , however continued to insult the woman 's looks , education and job on - camera vicious : @entity7 sports reporter @entity4 has been suspended for one week and could face further punishment after video surfaced of her berating an @entity197 employee in @entity156 , @entity157 glamorous : originally from @entity198 , @entity4 is a sideline reporter for @entity7 based in @entity199 is @entity9 , the clerk abused by @entity4 and told she needed to lose some weight the parking attendant patiently replies : ' well let 's get you out of here quickly			1
' @entity4 then fires back : ' yep , that 's all you care about - taking people 's money … with no education , no skill set			2
@entity212 wanted to clarify that			0
' after a few more comments , including telling the woman she does n't have a brain , @entity4 delivers her biggest sting			1
' maybe if i was missing some teeth they would hire me , huh ? ' she says			0
' cos i 'm on television and you 're in a f --- ingg trailer , honey			1
' finally , before walking away , @entity4 says : ' lose some weight , baby girl			0
' online petitions calling for the sports network to fire @entity4 , 28 , were approaching 10,000 signatures friday night after video was published on her rant against @entity154 in @entity156 , @entity157			0
warning : since @entity4 's outburst , this sign has been placed on the door of the @entity163 restaurant restaurant employees said @entity4 left her car in the parking lot after happy hour then went elsewhere @entity4 tweeted her regret but has yet to make any attempt to apologize to @entity9			0
@entity245 insists it does not want @entity4 to suffer			0
in a statement @entity197 said : ' parking enforcement is contentious by nature			0
at the same time , neither @entity9 , our lot clerk , nor our company , have any interest in seeing @entity4 suspended or terminated as a result of her comments			2
' ms @entity255 is our neighbor , and , as she said , to paraphrase , made remarks that were out of line			0
she is human and errors in judgement can be made in the heat of the moment			0
' @entity9 is a single mother of 3 children who works a difficult job to provide her family			0
@entity9 holds no ill will toward ms @entity255			0
' as a small regulated business , we saw no benefit to releasing the video , except to highlight personal attacks employees in jobs like towing , public parking enforcement and others sometimes encounter			0
' the video was not licensed or sold to anyone			0
' women 's rights champion ? @entity4 encourages her blog readers to ' be the woman with a voice , not the sex - ed up body without one '			2
she said she posted this selfie as an example of female empowerment pious : just eight days before her outburst , @entity4 lectured her @entity289 followers on the impact of words			0

@entity19 attorney @entity22 observed women are sexualized on tv
someone replied and mentioned @entity4 , but did n't tag the reporter
however , @entity4 found the post and began *lashing* out at @entity22
she called her a ' rando ' , insulted her *appearance* , and *mocked* her for ' bashing more successful ppl on @entity21 '
echoes how @entity4 told tow clerk : ' i 'm on tv , you 're in a f --- ing trailer '
