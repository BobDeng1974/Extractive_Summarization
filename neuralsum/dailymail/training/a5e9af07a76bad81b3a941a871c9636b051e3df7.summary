a nuclear plant was inches away from being engulfed by the bloated @entity1 after several levees in the area failed to hold back its surging waters , raising fears it could become @entity8 's @entity7			1
dramatic pictures show the moment the plant was threatened with being shut down today , as water levels rose ominously to within 18 inches of its walls			1
the river has to hit 902 feet above sea level at @entity16 before officials will shut down the @entity18 , which sits at 903 feet			1
it stopped and ebbed slightly yesterday , a reprieve caused by levee breaches in northwest @entity1 - for now			2
engulfed : the nuclear power station in @entity23 came within inches of having to be shut down flooding is a major concern all along the river because of the massive amounts of water that the @entity30 has released from six dams			1
any significant rain could worsen the flooding especially if it falls in @entity23 , @entity34 or @entity1 , which are downstream of the dams			2
the river is expected to rise as much as five to seven feet above the official ' flood stage ' in much of @entity23 and @entity34 and as much as 10 feet over in parts of @entity1			1
the corps predicts the river will remain that high until at least august			2
@entity41 spokesman @entity40 said the river rose to 900.56 feet at @entity16 on sunday , then dropped to 900.4 feet later in the day and remained at that level on monday morning			2
the @entity1 set a new record sunday at @entity16 when its depth was measured at 44.4 feet , topping the previous record of 44.3 feet set during the 1993 flooding , according to the @entity47			1
stranded : cars stop hopelessly , stranded by floodwaters over a bridge carnage : other vehicles were not quite so lucky and were swept away by the floods just north of @entity54 , @entity30 workers finally closed the final bays of the @entity57 yesterday			1
the gates were opened weeks ago in an effort to redirect high water on the @entity61 which threatened levees			1
meanwhile , the supply of sand used to fill hundreds of thousands of bags needed to fight off the swollen @entity1 is running low after weeks of relentless flooding			1
it 's a problem that could get worse as the river is expected to remain high through august , making it unsafe to gather sand from the easiest place to get it : the river itself			1
the @entity30 is monitoring the sand supply , said @entity76 , chief of emergency management for the corps ' @entity79			2
he said a ton of sand produces about 60 sandbags			2
sand also is piled along weakened areas of levees to prevent seepage			1
' you need lots of sand , lots of sand , ' @entity76 said			2
@entity92 , the fire chief in @entity93 , @entity34 , joked that his community deserves blame for thinning sand supplies			2
' we probably took all the sand , ' @entity92 said			2
@entity93 has filled at least 250,000 sandbags and dumped truckloads into fabric - lined metal - frame baskets to create a makeshift barrier to hold back water pouring through a breached @entity1 levee			1
downstream , @entity105 has filled 365,000 sandbags to reinforce low spots on levees and protect city buildings and the airport at @entity113 base , said public works director @entity114			2
the local supply of sand quickly ran out after flooding began in @entity105 , and the river was moving too swiftly to allow for dredging , @entity116 emergency director @entity115 said			1
the county had to ship in sand from @entity124 and @entity79			0
damage : a worker surveys they scene as he scales a levee attempting to hold back the floodwater man versus nature : a levee manages to keep the water from passing no passing : flood waters from the nearby @entity1 cover a county highway @entity139 also had to purchase sand from the @entity79 area , about an hour 's drive away , city manager @entity138 said			1
suburban @entity79 - based @entity143 , which sells sand , typically dredges the river at @entity105 for sand			1
because the river is so high and the current so strong , the company has been forced to cease dredging and may not start again until august , company president @entity148 said			0
but despite the shortage , he is refusing to raise the price			0
' i ca n't morally in my own brain think about increasing prices because of flooding , ' @entity148 said			1
the @entity18 remains operating at full capacity today but the @entity159 - based utility sent an emergency ' notification of unusual event ' to the @entity163 when the river rose to 899 feet early on sunday morning			1
deluge : statues of workers , part of @entity169 by @entity170 , stand in the rising waters of the @entity1 , in @entity172 ' we knew the river was going to rise for some time , ' @entity40 said			0
' it was just a matter of when			0
' the nuclear plant has been preparing for the flooding since may 30			1
more than 5,000 tons of sand has been brought in to construct barricades around it and access roads , according to @entity41			0
should water levels engulf the facility , forcing closure and repairs , energy bills in the area would be likely to rocket to cover the cost			1
' in that case we may have to raise rates , ' a spokeswoman said			0
the @entity30 said the river level at @entity16 had surged about two feet from saturday morning to sunday morning and that it continued to rise because of heavy rain on the @entity196 , which flows into the @entity1 from @entity34			1
the @entity197 is one of two plants along the @entity1 in eastern @entity23			0
the @entity200 , operated by the @entity201 , is about 20 miles north of @entity172			0
it issued a similar alert to the regulatory commission on june 6			0
the river has risen at least 1.5 feet higher than @entity200 's 1,004 - foot elevation above sea level			2
the plant can handle water up to 1,014 feet , according to @entity201			1
the water is being held back by a series of protective barriers , including an 8 - foot rubber wall outside the reactor building			2
its reactor already had been shut down for refuelling and maintenance since april , and it wo n't be turned on again until the flooding subsides			0
the entire plant still has full electrical power for safety systems , including those used to cool radioactive waste			0
it also has at least nine backup power sources			0
hope : engineers close the final bays of the @entity57 just above @entity54 a spokesman for the @entity163 said the @entity163 thinks @entity201 managers have ' done everything that they need to do to respond to the current conditions ' at the nuclear plant			1
over the weekend , several northern @entity1 levees failed to hold back the raging floodwaters , and the hole in a @entity238 levee that ruptured last week continued to grow			0
the water started pouring over levees on saturday night and sunday morning in @entity238 and @entity139 counties , flooding farmland , numerous homes and cabins			1
the recreational community of @entity246 , which is home to a state park and less than 200 people , is being threatened by the floodwater			0
most of @entity246 's residents have already evacuated			0
the area 78 miles north of @entity79 has been high for the past couple weeks , has experienced major flooding in three of the last five years			2
disaster : flood waters from the @entity1 engulf homes in neighbouring @entity34			0
more than 250 residents have now been evacuated from @entity1 after levees broke water flooded two highways , several homes were under as much as five feet of water and there was extensive farmland flooding , said @entity265 , clerk and flood plain manager for the village of @entity246			1
' it 's only going to get worse because there is lots of water coming in , ' @entity268 said			0
in @entity139 , where farmland was flooding , people have been evacuating for days , said @entity275 , a dispatcher for emergency services			0
gushing : the powerful waters rush through a ruptured levee near @entity93 , @entity34 , last week ' everybody is pretty much gone , ' @entity275 said			0
' the roads are closing , there is no way in or out			0
' authorties have urged around 250 people in northwester @entity1 to leave their homes			0
@entity76 , chief of emergency management for the @entity30 ' @entity288 , said the @entity1 dipped by almost 1 foot after the @entity246 breach in @entity1 but that the water started to rise again by sunday afternoon			0
he said @entity246 is seeking permission to cut a relief hole in an already - damaged county levee to allow water trapped behind the levee to flow back into the river			2
the @entity30 increased water releases on saturday from two dams -- @entity299 above @entity300 , @entity302 's capital , and @entity303 just downstream -- to make room for expected potentially heavy rains through early next week			1
they have been increasing water releases from five dams in @entity309 and @entity302 to roughly double prior records to relieve reservoirs most people left their homes well in advance of the flooding			2
those who stayed were told saturday night that water was flowing into the area			0
the @entity246 area , where water has been high for the past couple weeks , has experienced major flooding in three of the last five			1
@entity322 , the @entity323 chief , said that in @entity93 , @entity34 , the river was expected to crest at 10 feet over flood stage in the coming days			1
@entity322 said the river has been over flood stage since late april , and that forecasters are projecting river flows of 150,000 cubic feet ( 1.1 million gallons ) per second through august			1
' [ the levees ] are not designed for this amount of pressure for this length of time , ' @entity322 told @entity333			0
' they 've never been tested like this			0
' raging : residents burn wood to avoid it becoming flood debris flames : residents burn a pile of pallets in near @entity343 , @entity1 , to avoid them from becoming debris in flood waters after a levee broke ' there was some talk this morning about more than 150,000 cubic feet per second coming out of @entity299 , ' said @entity349 , working on sunday at a convenience store in @entity351			1
the threat of flooding is stressful , said @entity349 , who knows her customers by name and even knows what brand of cigarettes they buy			0
' people either moved out of their homes to another house , or they 're trying to live in a camper			0
some people have had their utilities cut off , ' she said			0
' we just sit here and wait			0
' peak releases are planned until at least mid-august and high flows are expected until december			0
the @entity47 said that the six to 12 inches of rainfall in the upper @entity1 basin in the past few weeks is nearly a normal year 's worth of raid , while runoff from the mountain snowpack is 140 per cent of average levels .			1

nuclear plant inches from being totally flooded , but is saved - for now
damage would be likely to cause energy prices to soar
six to 12 inches of heavy rainfall over the last few weeks
record floods hit 44.4 feet , topping 44.3 feet record set in 1993
levees fail to stem surge of water and sand is running out
flooding expected to continue until august
residents begin burning wood to avoid it becoming flood debris
