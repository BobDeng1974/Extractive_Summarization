forget the idea of an old - fashioned ski lodge , the newest @entity3 hotel in the @entity4 oozes @entity6 style , chic design and some rather unusual accessories			1
but with bars and beer taps on each floor , an outdoor @entity15 for relaxation and a location just steps from the slopes , it seems this new resort has it all			1
@entity20 is a hotel with a distinctive , quirky design , luxurious touches and even a climbing wall in the foyer			1
through @entity51 , locals and @entity3 fans were invited to vote for what they wanted from the huge 384 - room hotel			1
in response , the look and feel of the resort were tailored based on feedback , from the carpet colours to the new sports facilities			1
stepping foot inside the hotel you ca n't help but be in awe at the scale of the complex			2
it takes 15 minutes to walk from one block of rooms to another			0
the bedrooms are all designed so they face the sun , ensuring guests get the most sunshine on offer flooding into the rooms that come complete with a behemoth sized bed and luxurious seating area			2
one of the many quirky areas in the main dining room is an indoor @entity81 the @entity83 restaurant offers guests a more specialist menu and more luxurious areas they can unwind in guests will have access to a spectacular array of wines in the @entity83 restaurant staff are trained to give guests the best advice and recommendations when they are choosing their wine @entity83 has a balcony with sunbeds and seating areas as well as an outdoor jacuzzi the hotel has a main restaurant that serves buffet food with a handful of chefs cooking fresh meals to order as well as @entity83 , a separate dining area that offers picnic style food , a wine cellar and even a deli and grocery section			0
for the boozy members of your party , there is a bar or beer tap on every floor and during the night the fourth floor @entity120 bar turns into a nightclub , complete with a bizarre - but - must - see @entity123 take on @entity125 style entertainment			1
interestingly , @entity3 recently published a report that revealed that families are ' gramping ' or going on ski holidays with the grandparents			2
this new trend also revealed that grandparents are more inclined to pay for the whole holiday as a treat for the family			0
the view from the @entity83 balcony , showing the hotel 's close proximity to the slopes @entity141 if the highest resort in @entity123 and offers a superb variety of runs for snow sports enthusiasts @entity148 's @entity147 hits the heights of the @entity141 slopes with his snowboard former @entity153 skier @entity152 , an ambassador for the resort , joins writer @entity147 to board down the slopes a week at @entity3 's @entity156 resort starts from £ 1,597 per person , including flights and accommodation , access to all of the hotel 's facilities , lift pass , ski instructors and food and drink			1
visit clubmed.co.uk grandparents were repeatedly cited as an important part of the modern ski holiday with a fifth of holidaymakers having skied with extended family and grandparents in the last two years , probably because they provide excellent free childcare			0
however , here is where one of the best parts of the @entity3 all inclusive concept comes into play			2
private ski lessons with the top @entity182 ski instructors are actually included in your price			0
what does that mean for you ? well it means that you can either ski as a whole family or split off into three groups without having to worry that anyone is at risk of hurting themselves			0
@entity3 : @entity156 boasts a high - tech gym , aerobics studio and steam room guests are also given the chance to practice their climbing skills with this indoor climbing wall to be honest , even if you do n't need the lessons , it 's worth getting an instructor , just because you can save so much time jumping queues at gondolas and chairlifts			1
and they 're sure to offer local knowledge and some helpful pointers about technique along the way			0
one thing you should be aware of is that ski , board and boot rental are n't included in the price and will set you back another £ 150 depending on how much rental gear you need			0
i preferred to hit the slopes on my snowboard			0
and after a day of trying ( and failing ) to beat a five - time @entity224 ( @entity152 is a resort ambassador ) there was nothing better than heading back to the resort , soaking up the spa and heading for a drink			0
i can safely say i steered clear of that climbing wall all week .			1
