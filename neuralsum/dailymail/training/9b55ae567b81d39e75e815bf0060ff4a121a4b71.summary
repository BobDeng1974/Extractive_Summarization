the @entity0 has designed a massive spy satellite that will dwarf any space telescope ever launched - and it point its sensitive lens back at us			1
the @entity5 for @entity6 ( @entity7 ) will be capable of capturing 40percent of the surface of the @entity9 at once			1
it will be able to beam back real - time high - resolution video and images from anywhere in the world at any time			0
the satellite is the brainchild of @entity18 , the @entity0 agency tasked with developing the next generation of weapons and technology for the @entity23 military			1
this is an artist 's rending of the @entity5 for @entity6 ( @entity7 ) satellite that the @entity0 hopes to launch to spy on the earth this is one of the membrane panels from a prototype of the @entity7 satellite that completed testing on earth and it relies on a remarkable technological advancement that could increase the power and precision of space telescopes by several fold - while making them less costly , @entity42 reports			1
@entity7 uses massive membranes that will be shot into orbit collapsed , but once aloft , can expand to 68 feet in diameter			1
currently , the largest ground - based telescope is about half that size			0
the space - based @entity49 is less than eight feet in diameter			2
the membrane will be the thickness of household kitchen wrap , but will diffract light - instead of reflecting it or refracting it with mirrors like traditional glass optics			0
massive : this drawing shows how much bigger @entity7 is designed to be ( 68 feet ) compared to the @entity49 , the @entity61 telescope - which is one of the largest ground - based instruments in the world - and the @entity66 , a device planned for launch in 2018 this is a prototype full lens of the @entity7 satellite			1
there is no launch date for the telescope yet , but developers say it is in its final phase until now , the scope and precision of space telescopes was limited by the size of their lens , which are quickly becoming too heavy and expensive to carry into space - even for the largest rockets			2
' membrane optics could enable us to fit much larger , higher - resolution telescopes in smaller and lighter packages , ' lieutenant colonel @entity84 , a program manager for @entity7 , told @entity42			2
' in that respect , we â€™re " breaking the glass ceiling " that traditional materials impose on optics design			0
' the @entity7 satellite will be both cheaper to produce and cheaper to deploy , if the design works out because it does n't require the high - quality glass			2
@entity18 has already tested a ground - based prototype of the project			0
researchers will now move into the final phase of the project			0
no completion date has been made publicly available as yet .			0

membrane optical imager for @entity6 ( @entity7 ) uses a massive *web* of thin membranes instead of heavy lenses
it is being developed by @entity0 's @entity18 future weapons agency
satellite will have 68 - foot lens - dwarfing @entity49 , which is only eight feet
