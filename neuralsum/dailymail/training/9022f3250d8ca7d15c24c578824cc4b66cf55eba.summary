by @entity0 @entity1 is the latest celebrity to be spotted with a piece from @entity4 ’s spray painted ‘ grafitti ’ collection			1
the newly - single actress , 41 , was seen carrying the $ 3,800 tote at @entity10 ’s @entity9 on wednesday			2
she follows in the footsteps of @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 , all of whom have been seen carrying the backpack version , which costs upwards of $ 3,400			0
the ' it ' bag : @entity4 's @entity24 , seen her on @entity1 on wednesday , is shaping up to be the bag of the season close - up : the bag is meant to resemble an art student 's tote with graffiti , handmade lanyards , and frayed edges despite its popularity among the a-list , however , the collection has been much derided for its distressed , handmade appearance			1
presented as part of @entity4 ’s spring 2014 collection , the bag is intended to look like an art student ’s school tote with tears , paint splotches , handcrafted lanyards , and an overall distressed feel			1
it is also , of course , covered in the brand ’s signature ‘ @entity53 ’ logo			1
indeed , last month , the @entity55 ’s @entity54 helped her five - year - old daughter make a replica for just £ 7 ( $ 12 )			2
this general opinion does not seem to have hampered sales though			2
a call to the @entity4 store in @entity10 ’s @entity62 revealed that the entire graffiti bag collection is sold out worldwide			1
the @entity4 sales associate told @entity65 : ‘ it was n’t even that bad , the price , ’ attributing their popularity to a lower - than - average cost			1
on the runway : the bag was presented as part of @entity4 's spring 2014 show in @entity74 @entity75 : the label 's @entity76 has been spotted on a slew of stylish celebrities including @entity12 ( right ) and @entity13 ( left ) many consumers , however , do not agree			1
commenters on @entity82 were widely offended by the bag ’s price			2
a reader named @entity86 wrote : ‘ these canvas bags are an insult			2
’ another commenter named @entity90 wrote : ‘ @entity91 [ @entity92 ] could put the @entity53 logo on a garbage bin and people would lap it up as some abstract monument of his genius … i 'm getting tired of @entity91 ’s weird sense of humour for the bags ... it does look like a bag you can make with @entity104			1
’ and a reader who goes by @entity106 said : ‘ i really do n't think it 's worth the $ 3,400 price tag for splattered paint and a @entity4 logo written in white out ...			1
thanks @entity91 , but no thanks ... you wo n't get us this time			0
. next ! [ sic ] ’ the clan : @entity16 and @entity17 were both seen in the bags on separate trips to @entity118 the celebrities who have been seen with the bags demonstrate various ways of styling it			0
@entity15 and @entity13 – both likely gifted the bags by @entity4 – have an understated approach			1
@entity12 , meanwhile , styled the backpack with a glam - rock aesthetic , wearing it last month in @entity10 with an oversize army green jacket , white sweatpants , and combat boots			0
and leave it to the @entity17 clan to take the most straightforward glam - o-rama approach			0
@entity134 toted the backpack at @entity118 in early march – along with practical airport attire like netted stiletto boots and skin - tight skinny jeans			0
rebels : @entity15 ( left ) and @entity14 ( right ) both took their signature dressed - down approach to the backpack mother @entity16 also carried the backpack just a few days earlier at @entity118 , after returning from a trip to @entity147			0
like her daughter , @entity16 wore the purse with an all - black ensemble , but with more comfort in mind			0
in lieu of stilettos , she wore slip - on velvet sneakers			0
other fans of the bag include @entity14 , who carried the backpack earlier this month , as well as @entity159 who was seen with it as she arrived in @entity118 following her @entity162 bachelorette party last weekend .			0

the graffiti - themed bag collection has been *mocked* for its *disheveled* ‘ art student ’ appearance
