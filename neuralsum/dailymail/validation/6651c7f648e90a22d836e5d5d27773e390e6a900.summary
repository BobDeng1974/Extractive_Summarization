at least one lab employee has tested positive for a deadly bacteria used to make bioweapons that mysteriously escaped a @entity4 research center in november			1
additionally , the number of monkey 's infected by the bioterror bacterium at the @entity8 has increased from eight to nine and are expected to continue rising , officials say			2
three of the monkeys have already been euthanized after showing signs of @entity13 , which was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500 - acre facility			1
the test results showed the employee was ' just at the threshold for a verified positive result ' and has not shown any symptoms of the diseases the bacteria can bring on , such as tuberculosis , according to @entity25			1
despite thorough investigations by bothb federal and state authorities , including the @entity31 , the cause of the contamination is still unknown			0
concerns : monkeys at the @entity34 in @entity4 were exposed to a potentially deadly bacteria last fall - but authorities still do not know how or why it happened reach : worryingly , the center is close to a river ( top left ) , homes and a school			1
although there are no signs that surrounding areas have been exposed to the bacteria , further tests are required the name of the employee has not been released			1
questions also remain over how far the bacteria , which is primarily found in southeast @entity50 and northeast @entity51 , has spread around the complex and surrounding areas			1
animals pass it in their urine and feces - potentially contaminating the ground and water around them - and others can become infected through direct contact with the contaminated areas			1
the bacteria may not cause an illness until days or years after the exposure , but the illness can be fatal in humans and animals , according to @entity69			2
the monkeys , rhesus macaques , had access to massive outdoor primate breeding cages , where around 4,000 macaques are kept			1
it is not yet known if the bacteria have colonized in the cages			2
worryingly , the research center is just half a mile from a school and surrounded by homes			1
and only yards behind the facility , there is a river that leads to a lake surrounded by wildlife refuges			0
the contaminated primates were all at the center 's veterinary hospital at the same time last fall , leading to speculation that they could have been exposed there			2
infected : at least seven rhesus macaques ( file picture ) have shown signs of exposure and three have died potentially deadly : @entity13 the bacteria , @entity13 , can cause a potentially serious disease in people and animals called melioidosis			1
@entity103 commonly involves the lungs and has a range of symptoms including fever , headache , appetite loss , muscle and joint pain			0
the illness may not develop for days to years			0
it is often mistaken as pneumonia or tuberculosis , and if left untreated , it is fatal			0
several countries have looked into using the bacteria as a bioweapon because strains can be resistant to multiple antibiotics			2
the overall mortality rate is 40 per cent but in @entity124 , where the bacteria is endemic , it is up to 50 per cent			0
the bacteria , which is primarily found in southeast @entity50 and northeast @entity51 , has never been found in nature in the @entity128 last week , tests by the @entity31 determined two further monkeys showed signs of contracting the bacteria , bring the number of infected monkeys to seven			1
the @entity31 will now be looking at safety and health practices at the veterinary hospital , the agency said			0
@entity139 , a biosafety expert from @entity140 in @entity141 , previously told @entity69 that the release was worrying			0
' the fact that they ca n't identify how this release occurred is very concerning , ' he said			0
' human error is always the first explanation you should consider for a laboratory accident			0
' the easiest way to transfer something from one place where it 's supposed to be , to another where it is n't supposed to be is by a worker moving from one place to the other			0
' state officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed			0
the @entity128 @entity164 is also working on information to give animal owners , veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed			1
authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk			0
only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in @entity124			2
those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area , suggesting there was no public health risk .			2

at least nine rhesus macaques at @entity34 were exposed to @entity13 , a deadly bacteria
they were exposed even though the bacterium was being studied in a secure lab in another part of the 500 - acre @entity4 research complex
one employee tested positive ' just at the threshold '
*initial* tests indicate that it has not spread to surrounding areas - which include a school and homes - but further tests are required
the potentially deadly bacterium , @entity13 , is not found in the @entity128 and can be contracted through contact with contaminated areas
