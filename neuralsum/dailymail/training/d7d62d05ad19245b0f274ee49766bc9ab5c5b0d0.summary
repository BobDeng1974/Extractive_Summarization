' he looked very pale			0
i thought he was going to die			0
' @entity0 did n't know his name was @entity2 at that moment - he only knew that he looked young enough to be @entity38 , the son he lost in @entity40 , or @entity41 , his boy who tragically killed himself in the years after that			1
the selfless bravery the 52 - year - old showed that day on @entity46 was captured forever by @entity48 photographer @entity47 - his image of @entity2 's ashen face and @entity0 in his white cowboy hat splashed across the front pages of the world 's papers			1

' i do n't know how long this is going to last , ' @entity0 said in october to the @entity94			1
' i did n't ask for any of this			0

' ' the commandant of the @entity75 has entrusted me to express his deep regret that your son , @entity158 , was killed in action today in @entity161 , @entity40 ...

@entity0 , who was at the finish line of the 117th @entity31 when two explosives detonated , leaves the scene on april 15 , 2013 in @entity3 his actions that day proved polarizing to the nation - was he broken by the news his son died in a controversial war , or was @entity0 selfishly stealing the limelight from his hero son ? ' i lost my mind , ' he said recently of the incident , which led him to be know as the @entity192			1
in the months after the incident , @entity0 sought out the three @entity75 who informed him of his son 's death to apologize			1
police decided to not press charges and even his hospital bills were waived			0
because he was the father of a fallen veteran , @entity0 ' application for @entity90 citizenship was speeded up and he was made on in december 2006			2
the photographer who was there to capture the event - the @entity48 's @entity47 , the same photographer who would later snap the iconic shot of @entity0 with @entity2 in @entity3			1
however , the stresses and strains of his burns and his continuing grief over his son @entity38 proved too much			0
he was admitted to @entity213 in @entity214 , a psychiatric hospital , having moved away from @entity70 following his son 's death			0
but for @entity0 , there was worse pain to come			2
@entity38 's brother @entity41 , was 17 in 2004 and had been struggling since he had left to joint the army			0
he was having problems at school and had a brush with the law after stealing jewelry from a girlfriends house			0
@entity0 pulls a mock coffin of his son @entity158 , who was killed in @entity40 , as he joins other protesters marching toward the venue of the @entity231 in @entity232 , @entity233 august 31 , 2008 @entity41 began to fall into problems with drugs , using cocaine and heroin and moved into an apartment in a shed in his mother 's backyard in @entity214			1
his first suicide attempt came in 2006 when he tried to strangle himself and it failed			0
he then tried to commit suicide by cop in 2011 - brandishing a machete at them - only to be subdued and placed in a mental institution			2

@entity128 called @entity0 with the news			2
' no , @entity84 , no ! ! ! ! ' @entity0 screamed			2

@entity0 was there to cheer them on			2
oddly , just before @entity0 waded in to help the wounded , he took pictures			2
this caused the @entity273 to wonder why , in short , they wondered whether @entity0 was involved , so unusual was it to take pictures of blown - off limbs and bleeding injured			1
however , the suspicions quickly lifted in the days after the attacks and now as the face of ' @entity10 ' - @entity0 uses his fame to keep himself busy			1

@entity0 became the face of ' @entity10 ' in the weeks and months following the bombings
it was revealed he suffered the loss of his two sons before the attacks - one during service in @entity40 - the other to suicide
he *rescued* terror victim @entity2 because he looked like and *reminded* @entity305 of his own two boys
