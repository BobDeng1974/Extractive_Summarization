a family was awarded the rights to 10 rare gold coins possibly worth $ 80 million or more on friday after a @entity4 appeals court overturned a jury verdict			1
@entity4 @entity7 officials insist the $ 20 @entity8 were stolen from the @entity9 in @entity10 before the 1933 series was melted down when the country went off the gold standard			1
they argued that @entity15 and her sons can not lawfully own the coins , which she said she found in a family bank deposit box in 2003			1
the government believed that @entity27 stole the coins from a mint in 1933 @entity15 's father , jeweler @entity27 , had dealings with the @entity9 in the 1930s and was twice investigated over his coin holdings			1
a jury in 2012 sided with the government			0
however , the appeals court returned the coins to the @entity41 because @entity4 officials had not responded within a 90 - day limit to the family 's seized - property claim , filed in about 2004			2
family lawyer @entity46 said : ' @entity47 clearly intended for there to be limits on the government 's ability to seek forfeiture of citizens ' property , and today 's ruling reaffirms that those limits are real and wo n't be excused when the government violates them			0
' @entity15 , who 's in her mid- 80s , worked in her father 's store on @entity61 for most of her life			1
her sons , entertainment lawyer @entity64 , of @entity65 , and @entity66 , of @entity67 , @entity68 , joined her in the legal fight			0
nearly half a million of the coins were minted in 1933 , though almost all were melted and a surviving coin sold for $ 7.6million in 2002 the coins were never released to the public after president @entity75 switched the @entity4 off the gold standard they do not plan to comment on the ruling and have not decided whether the coins will be sold , @entity46 said			1
sculptor @entity80 designed the @entity8 with a flying eagle on one side and a figure representing liberty on the other			0
one @entity8 , once owned by @entity86 , sold in 2002 for $ 7.6 million , then a record for a coin			2
its later owner , a @entity90 coin dealer once jailed by the @entity4 over it , split the proceeds with the @entity4 in a deal brokered by @entity46			0
the @entity93 offered the government a similar split but were rebuffed			0
the family had taken the coins to the @entity98 in @entity10 to have them examined , @entity46 said			2
a coin that was that was once owned by @entity86 ( left ) fetched millions thirteen years ago			0
the @entity102 brought their coins into the government for authentication , but the valuables were seized ' they authenticated the coins and said , ' thank you very much			2
we will now be keeping them , '' he said			0
the @entity9 struck nearly a half - million of the @entity8 in @entity10 in 1933 but never released them after president @entity75 abandoned the gold standard and prohibited using the gold coins as currency			1
the money makers in @entity10 sent all of their gold coins to be melted in 1937 , according to @entity119			0
the 1933 ' @entity8 ' was dreamed up by president @entity75 â€™s distant cousin , @entity120 , who had commissioned the sculptor @entity80 to re-design the $ 20 gold coin in the early 1900s			1
@entity124 wanted an @entity126 coin that matched the beauty of the ancient @entity129 ones			0
the last run of nearly 500,000 coins were never released , and it was thought they were all melted down for scrap			0
in industry speak , an ' eagle ' is $ 10 , hence the term ' double eagle ' for the $ 20 1933 examples			1
while prosecutors argued to jurors in 2011 that @entity27 must have stolen the coins with help from a @entity9 insider , @entity46 said he could have traded his scrap gold for them			1
@entity145 , a journalist who wrote a history of the 1933 @entity8 , told the @entity147 that @entity46 had an ' amazing accomplishment ' by making the government prove that no coins could have possible gotten out of the mint legally			1
she said that the government attorneys decided not to prosecute @entity27 when they learned about his possible involvement in the 1940s because the statute of limitations had passed			2
@entity157 , curator of @entity126 coins and currency at the @entity160 , said that federal authorities had been ' fanatical ' about finding the existing coins			0
the @entity4 @entity163 said it was reviewing its options after friday 's ruling			2
a @entity7 spokeswoman had no comment			0
@entity27 , who died in 1990 , admitted to the @entity98 in 1944 that he had possessed and sold a set of nine other @entity8 , which were recovered and destroyed			1
the surviving @entity86 coin is believed to have been a 10th coin from that batch			0
the @entity9 sent a pair of 1933 @entity8 to the @entity173 for its @entity4 coin collection .			1

@entity15 , in her mid- 80s , and sons win back ten 1933 @entity8
@entity179 had brought rare coins to @entity98 when they were taken
coins from @entity15 's father @entity27 had been in a lock box until 2003
very few of the $ 20 coins exist because @entity75 ordered @entity4 off gold standard
government said @entity27 stole them , though he could have traded for them
