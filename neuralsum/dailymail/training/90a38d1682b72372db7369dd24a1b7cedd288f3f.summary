by @entity0 , @entity1 correspondent published : 18:02 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 03:11 est , 2 january 2013 brutal : a man is hanged in @entity3 for selling drugs @entity8 taxpayers have handed at least £ 3.6million in aid to @entity3 , an investigation has found			1
the money has been used to fund the @entity14 state ’s security and border forces in an effort to stem the supply of drugs into @entity18			1
but campaign group @entity19 , which carried out the investigation , said recent spending had coincided with a huge surge in the number of alleged traffickers executed for their crimes			1
the number arrested and executed by the @entity3 state has been described as a ‘ killing spree of staggering proportions ’ by another campaign group , @entity30			1
over a four - year period when @entity8 has been handing its anti-drug aid , @entity3 has executed more than 1,000 alleged traffickers			1
there are also fears that the spending on security equipment such as 4x4 vehicles , night - vision goggles and mobile phone scanning devices could be used to crack down on dissent			0
the revelations come days after @entity42 mounted a spirited defence of his policy of increasing foreign aid , saying @entity8 had a ‘ moral obligation ’ to help the world ’s poor , even during times of austerity at home			1
the prime minister acknowledged it was ‘ difficult ’ to make the case , but said specific programmes , such as those directed at tackling disease or child malnutrition , were producing tangible benefits			0
he said the @entity8 people were ‘ very generous ’ , but said it was in the @entity8 ’s wider interests to ensure that troubled states such as @entity63 did not descend into chaos and fuel illegal immigration and terrorism			2
however , the fact that millions has been spent on aid to @entity3 will heighten public concern that taxpayers ’ money is being wasted or used unwisely			1
concern : 488 people were hanged in @entity3 for drug offences in 2011 ( file picture ) reprieve investigator @entity76 said : ‘ it ’s outrageous that @entity8 , which is supposed to be committed to the abolition of capital punishment , should in fact be funding executions for drug offences in @entity3			1
given the country ’s appalling record on human rights , there will be real concerns about how the equipment and support provided by @entity8 is being used			2
‘ hundreds are being hanged every year , including children , vulnerable people and innocent scapegoats ; that @entity8 should have played a part in this tragedy is shameful			2
’ @entity3 borders @entity96 , which is responsible for around 90 per cent of the world ’s opium production			2
in 2008 @entity3 executed 96 people for drug trafficking			2
the following year that rose to 172 , then 360 in 2010 and 488 in 2011			0
three quarters of all executions carried out in the country are for drug offences , and those sentenced to death include a 12 - year - old boy and a 16 - year - old boy			1
@entity19 said arrests had soared during a £ 750,000 joint @entity8 - @entity112 investigations project in @entity3 in 2010 - 11 and several of those arrested had been sentenced to death			1
partnership : @entity42 's government funds a scheme administered by the @entity3 regime of @entity118 , right between 2007 and 2010 @entity8 , @entity112 , @entity120 and @entity121 jointly funded a £ 1.73million border control project , which paid for security equipment , personnel training and paid for body scanners , sniffer dogs and other equipment			1
@entity8 also paid up £ 117,000 for equipment including motorcycles , software and mobile telephone interception equipment , the investigation found			2
since 1998 the @entity8 has provided at least £ 3.6million for anti-drug programmes			0
the government has refused to provide a breakdown of funding in recent years			0
much of the funding goes through the @entity138 – making it even harder to track where it ends up			0
in september 2011 foreign secretary @entity141 met the @entity3 foreign minister at the @entity138 in @entity143 and said he wanted ‘ deeper cooperation ’ with @entity3 on fighting drug trafficking			0
@entity146 , chief executive of the @entity147 ’ @entity149 campaign group , said : ‘ taxpayers expect the aid budget to be directly helping the world ’s vulnerable and needy , not spent on beefing up borders in @entity3			1
’ a @entity155 spokesman said : ‘ we provide aid to a range of partners to tackle the international drugs trade and minimise the threat it poses to the @entity8			1
‘ we take human rights very seriously and provide clear guidance to our officials			0
it is our policy not to disclose details about specific programmes or locations as to do so may reduce the effectiveness of this work			0
’ the prime minister has stuck to his pre-election pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of @entity8 ’s income on foreign aid			0
in a letter to @entity179 leaders yesterday mr @entity42 called for a major drive against corruption in the developing world			0
he said showing that aid money was well spent was ‘ vital ’ in securing lasting support for it in the @entity186			0
but at the weekend an @entity189 / @entity188 poll revealed that only one in four people now back the @entity192 ’s aid policy			0
more than 60 per cent said most of the money spent on aid was ‘ wasted ’ .			0

@entity19 said money coincides with surge in alleged trafficker executions
in four years more than 1,000 alleged traffickers were sentenced to death
three quarters of all executions in @entity3 are for drugs offences
campaign group said @entity8 is ' funding executions ' in @entity3
money given to try to curb the supply of drugs into @entity18
