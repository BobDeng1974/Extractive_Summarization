@entity0 ended a week of speculation and debate over the state of his game by announcing on friday that he will play next week in the masters			1
the 39 - year - old played an 18 - hole practice round on tuesday at @entity9 , and @entity10 said he was seen on the practice range friday morning at the club			1
' i 'm playing in the masters , ' @entity0 said on his website			1

' i 've worked a lot on my game , and i 'm looking forward to competing			1
i 'm excited to get to @entity9 , and i appreciate everyone 's support			1
i 'm excited to get to @entity9 ' woods , a four - time @entity30 champion , last competed at the @entity26 on february 5 at @entity27 when he walked off the course after 11 holes because of tightness in his lower back , and after another shockingly bad display of chipping			1
that followed a missed cut at the @entity38 , where he shot a career - high 82			1
he will have gone nine weeks without competition when he hits his opening tee shot on thursday at the masters , which is not unprecedented for @entity0			2
he went nearly five months without playing when he returned in 2010 from a crisis in his personal life that led to one of the greatest downfalls in sport , and he tied for fourth that year			0
scrutiny might be even greater this time around			2
after two trips to @entity9 this week , @entity0 announced his return to the competition ( above @entity0 at the @entity38 open on january 30 ) @entity0 hits a shot on the fourth hole during the final round of the @entity57 at @entity9 in april 2013 the last time @entity0 took an extended break before the masters , he had won his previous tournament at the @entity61 masters			1
now , his game has been in disarray over a series of injuries and another change in coaching			2
@entity0 has plunged to no. 104 in the world ranking , his lowest spot since a week before his first professional victory in 1996			0
he last won a tournament in august 2013 at the @entity72 , and he has not had a top ten since the end of 2013			0
woods missed the @entity30 last year because of back surgery to alleviate a pinched nerve			1
four tournaments into his return , he again dealt with back pain and sat out the final four months of the season to fully recover and get stronger			2
woods celebrated making the winning putt on the 18th green during the @entity84 at @entity9 but when he returned at his @entity85 in december , he tied for last in an 18 - man field and chipped so poorly that some analysts said he had the chipping yips			1
he would either duff them short or blade them over the green			0
at the @entity38 this year during the pro-am , @entity0 hit a bunker shot that went over the green and into the first row of bleachers			0
' he 's got to go out and probably exorcise some of those demons , ' @entity95 , a former @entity96 champion and @entity98 analyst , said thursday			2
' the first little pitch shot he 's got to hit — not chip shot , the first little pitch shot he 's got to hit — will be microanalyzed , and he knows that			0
there 's a big microscope on that guy			0
' i do n't think he 'd show up unless he feels like he solved that problem			0
' woods will be closely watched during the masters tournament next week , said former @entity96 champion @entity95 ( above @entity111 shakes hands with @entity0 after he won the masters in 2005 ) a week after withdrawing in the middle of his round at @entity27 , @entity0 announced that his game and scores were unacceptable and he would not return until he felt he could compete at the highest level			1
when he skipped the @entity119 at @entity120 , he said he hoped to be ready for the masters and would continue working			2
second - hand reports have ranged from @entity0 playing well at his home club of @entity124 in @entity125 to making five birdies in a round of 74 at @entity9 earlier this week			0
next week , he will be playing his first major since turning 39 in december			0
