by @entity0 published : 04:20 est , 1 june 2012 updated : 03:08 est , 2 june 2012 @entity1 yesterday publicly accused her ex-husband @entity2 of effectively forcing her to take his speeding points because she was his wife			1
@entity1 , 59 , will use a rarely employed piece of legislation to claim she was the victim of ' marital coercion ' when the former cabinet minister was allegedly caught by a motorway speed camera			1
the pair are at war over a driving penalty which @entity12 , 57 , allegedly dodged after he was caught speeding in 2003			0
serious business : @entity2 and @entity1 arrived at @entity14 to face charges that he persuaded her when they were married to lie about a speeding offence yesterday they appeared at @entity14 in @entity18 for a preliminary hearing			1
they are jointly charged with perverting the course of justice by covering up the offence			0
@entity1 's defence will allege that @entity2 ' coerced ' her into taking the penalty points			1
her lawyers will use an antiquated piece of legislation dating back to 1925 in which a wife can argue that she acted under duress due to the influence of her spouse			0
the @entity35 of 1925 states : ' on a charge against a wife for any offence other than treason or murder it shall be a good defence to prove that the offence was committed in the presence of , and under the coercion of , the husband			0
' in a separate development , @entity2 's lawyer announced that he would be seeking to dismiss the charge on the basis that there is no case for him to answer			2
the @entity52 has hired barrister @entity53 , @entity54 , who successfully defended @entity56 manager @entity55 against tax evasion charges earlier this year			0

happier times : @entity2 allegedly persuaded his former partner @entity1 , left , to take his penalty points for a speeding offence almost a decade ago the disputed events date back to march 2003 , when @entity2 's car was caught by a speed camera on the motorway between @entity66 in @entity67 and @entity18			1
it is alleged that @entity2 , who at the time was a @entity70 , asked @entity1 to take three speeding points so he could avoid a driving ban , meaning the pair subsequently lied to police about who was driving the car			1
it was only after @entity2 left his wife in june 2010 for his press agent @entity79 , that newspaper stories alleged he had forced her to take penalty points on his behalf			2
the explosive allegations led to the resignation of @entity2 from the @entity85 earlier this year following an exhaustive eight - month police investigation which resulted in charges			2
allegations : the events which led to the charges date back to march 2003 , when @entity2 's car was allegedly caught by a speed camera on the motorway between @entity66 in @entity67 and @entity18 the indictment against them states that between march 12 and may 21 , 2003 , @entity2 and @entity1 ' with intent to pervert the course of public justice did an act which had a tendency to pervert the course of justice '			1
yesterday @entity2 stared straight ahead at the judge , ignoring his ex-wife , who seemed tense , leaning forward in her seat throughout the hearing			1
even though they were forced to share the dock , such is the bitter acrimony between the man and woman who were married for 26 years that they could barely stand to look at each other			0
