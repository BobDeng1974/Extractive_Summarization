@entity2 face @entity0 at the formidable @entity3 on tuesday night bidding to reach the @entity6 group stages for the 17th consecutive year			1
@entity7 provides the lowdown on the @entity10 ' opponents ahead of the first leg of the qualifying tie in @entity13			1
it will be raucous , visceral and unpleasant			0
when @entity32 visited in 2009 , sir @entity31 said afterwards : ' the fans made the loudest noise i have ever heard			0
' @entity2 will have to show that they are made of the right stuff and silence the @entity3			2
flying the flag : @entity0 supporters are passionate , noisy and generate a fearsome atmosphere firestarter : @entity0 supporters revel in the heat of a @entity6 clash against @entity43 in 2003 anything to concern @entity2 on the pitch ? pre-season can often be a deception - just ask @entity32 - but @entity0 did beat @entity43 1 - 0 in @entity13 just a few weeks ago			1
it was , however , only a 45 - minute game			0
the @entity28 also lost 2 - 1 against @entity49 in a friendly game this summer			0
danger sign ? @entity51 ( right ) and @entity52 ( left ) during @entity0 's pre-season defeat of @entity43 who do @entity2 need to watch out for ? @entity55 is the main man , having moved to @entity0 this summer after scoring 50 goals in @entity58 football over the course of three seasons at @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity43			1
another former @entity64 player - @entity63 - who spent a couple of seasons at @entity67 , is highly - rated by @entity2 's @entity28 opposition			1
familiar face : @entity55 ( centre ) now leads the line for the @entity28 after his summer move from @entity43 and who 's the leader on the sidelines ? @entity14 , the former @entity61 defender that rather enjoys knocking @entity58 teams out of competitions			2
he was the man in charge of @entity79 when they defeated @entity82 's @entity81 home and away to deny the @entity81 ' progress into @entity85			0
bogey man : @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity79 defender @entity14 is boss at @entity0 reason to be cheerful ? @entity2 have a potent record against @entity28 opposition			1
over 90 minutes , they have played seven games , winning four of those and drawing three			0
@entity2 also defeated @entity28 side @entity95 to qualify for the @entity6 group stages last season			1
reason to be fearful ? @entity2 fans still rue that @entity101 final in @entity102 in 2000 , when the @entity10 were defeated by @entity103 in a penalty shootout			2
@entity105 and @entity106 both missed from the spot to hand the victory to the @entity28 side			1
in clashes before the game , four men were stabbed			0
paid the penalty : @entity113 ( left ) , @entity105 ( centre ) and @entity115 ( right ) after @entity2 's @entity101 final defeat against @entity103 in @entity102 in 2000			2
