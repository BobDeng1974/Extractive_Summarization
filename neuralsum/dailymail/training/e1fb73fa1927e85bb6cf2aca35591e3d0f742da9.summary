by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor @entity2 today took on his critics to insist he is a ' totally different ' person to the last time he was an mp and set his sights on a serious government job			1
he defended his decision to stand for @entity7 next year while still @entity9 mayor , amid a backlash from @entity12 mps who suspect he will not be a team player			1
but his attempt to present himself as a man ready to take the tough decisions was overshadowed when he inexplicably appeared at a photocall wearing goggles and purple gloves to prune a tree			0
there is already talk that mr @entity2 has already assembled a ' kitchen cabinet ' to run not just his leadership campaign but to support him in the first months of his premiership			1
for many voters , the reports will be at odds with his chaotic and crumpled appearance			0
those in @entity48 with long memories also recall that when he was last in the @entity50 he regularly made news for the wrong reasons , including sparking a row with @entity54 , upsetting the people of @entity56 and resigning from the frontbench over allegations of having an affair			0
but today mr @entity2 insisted he was a change man			2
in an interview with the @entity61 , he said : ' yeah , i think i 'm genuinely totally different			0
i mean , whether human beings ever change is a good question , is n't it			0
' but if you do a job like this in @entity9 for a very long time , and you see the way people depend on you getting it right , and you have to engage with people who really feel that fares are too high , who are really being hurt by it , or people who can not get a home for their children , i think you do			1
' i think i understand the business of government pretty well now			0
and i hope very much at some stage to be doing it			0
' 24 hours after announcing his plan to stand for @entity7 next year , mr @entity2 also visited the orthodox jewish community in @entity86 today , where he pointed at met rabbi @entity87 the comments will be seen as a claim to be more in touch with voters , and a clear indication that he hopes to secure a @entity94 job in a future @entity12 government			1
he will spend a year as @entity96 and an mp , before @entity99 elections in 2016			1
he will then be free to join the frontbench			0
if the @entity12 are in government after the general election , he can expect a @entity94 job , but if @entity35 loses , he will be in prime position to launch a leadership bid			1
he played down such talk today : ' when @entity107 steps down in 2030 or so i will be too old			0
there ’ll be a very wide field , probably including babes yet unborn			0
' mr @entity2 's announcement that he will stand as an mp yesterday came as he answered questions following a speech on @entity115 at @entity117 's @entity9 headquarters			1
bookmakers @entity118 responded by slashing the odds of mr @entity2 becoming the next @entity12 leader from 5/1 to 9/4			1
@entity121 said it was a clear sign the @entity123 were turning in on themselves with mr @entity35 powerless to intervene			0
amid claims mr @entity2 has his eye set on becoming prime minister , @entity124 warned the messy hair and ' bumbliness ' is just a front to disguise his ruthless ambition			1
he appeared dishevelled and sweaty during his speech at @entity117 yesterday , but @entity124 suggested it was all part of an act to disguise his ruthlessness mr @entity124 insisted that the messy hair and creased suit was part of an image as carefully managed as his political ambitions			1
the deputy prime minister said the @entity9 mayor liked to pretend he did not care about his appearance or career - but was actually ' fixated ' with them			2
. speaking on his @entity147 phone - in , mr @entity124 said : ' the thing about @entity2 is despite all the kind of clumsiness and bumbliness , he 's actually a really , really ambitious politician ... ' he treats his political ambition a bit like he treats his hair			1
he wants everyone to think that he does n't really care , but he actually really , really does care			2
' the @entity157 leader said mr @entity2 had until now been able to ' have his cake and eat it '			1
' he will have to come clean about the fact that he is in many ways a much more conventional politician than he likes to appear , ' mr @entity124 said			2
' his tousled hair , his bumbliness , his humour , all of that is great ... all i am saying is behind all of that is someone who is absolutely fixated with his own political ambitions			2
in that sense , he is actually a very conventional politician			0
' in a sense , being a mayor is great , a wonderful position to have , but you can kind of have your cake and eat it			0
you can sort of lob grenades into the political debate without having to take responsibility for stuff			0
' at some point he is actually going to have to say ' i 'm going to do responsible stuff , i 've got to take difficult decisions '			0
' the deputy prime minister used his weekly radio phone - in to claim mr @entity2 's political ambitions actually made him quite ' conventional ' deciding to stand for election is just the first step for @entity2 - now he must find a seat			1
with just nine months to go until the general election , most sitting @entity12 mps have either decided to stand again , or have quit and already had a successor selected			1
mr @entity2 will need a constituency close to @entity9 , which rules out @entity196 and @entity197			2
and there must be a vacancy , which should exclude @entity200 and @entity201 , where @entity202 insists he will stand again			2
which makes @entity205 most likely , just 20 miles from @entity99 and sir @entity203 is standing down , leaving a health majority of more than 11,000			0
@entity205 current mp : sir @entity203 , 59 , is retiring majority : 11,216 distance from @entity99 : 20 miles @entity210 current mp : @entity211 , 57 , not re-adopted majority : 17,605 distance from @entity99 : 16 miles @entity213 & @entity214 current mp : @entity215 , 72 , still standing majority : 16,371 distance from @entity99 : 16 miles @entity196 and @entity197 current mp : sir @entity217 , retiring majority : 13,871 distance from @entity99 : 150 miles @entity219 current mp : @entity220 , 59 , standing again majority : 16,588 distance from @entity99 : 40 miles @entity222 current mp : sir @entity223 , 69 , standing down majority : 15,818 distance from @entity99 : 12 miles @entity200 & @entity201 current mp : @entity202 , 62 , standing again majority : 13,900 distance from @entity99 : 10 miles pressure had been growing on mr @entity2 over several months to finally say whether or not he will mount a bid to return to the @entity50			1
he quit as mp for @entity219 in 2008 after being elected mayor of @entity9			0
but since mr @entity35 became prime minister in 2010 there has been mounting speculation that mr @entity2 would seek a route back to @entity48 , after vowing to only serve two terms at @entity99			1
mr @entity35 has suggested his old friend could remain in charge of the capital and take a seat in @entity94 if he becomes an mp at the next election			2
yesterday mr @entity2 departed from tradition and gave a straight answer , confirming he would run for @entity7 in the general election next year			1
speaking at @entity117 in @entity9 , he said : ' i have danced around it for an awfully long time			1
the @entity245 said ages ago that he would welcome me back			0
' it is also been pretty clear i can not endlessly go on dodging these questions as i have tried to do			0
' let me put it this way			0
i have n't got any seat lined up yet			0
but i do think that in all probability , since you can not do these things furtively , in all probability i will try to find somewhere to stand in 2015			0
' however , @entity121 accused mr @entity2 of breaking a pledge not to try to return to @entity7 while he was still @entity9 mayor			1
in 2012 election he told the @entity61 he would ' serve out that term in full ' and keeping his ' solemn vow ' to lead the capital out of recession and deliver growth ' can not be combined with any other political capacity '			0
every time a @entity12 safe seat has become available when an sitting mp has announced plans to stand down , mr @entity2 has been linked with it			1
the most recent has been @entity205 , where @entity12 mp sir @entity203 is retiring in 2015			1
mr @entity2 's announcement came after a stridently @entity269 speech , during which he listed a series of hardline reforms he wants to see before agreeing to support a vote to stay in the @entity273			0
within hours , his return to @entity48 was welcomed by a series of backbenchers who hope mr @entity2 can attract @entity278 voters back to the @entity123			2
the mayor does not even have a seat yet – although the recently vacated @entity9 constituency of @entity205 and @entity282 , a safe @entity12 seat , is up for grabs after the retirement of its sitting member			2
@entity118 slashed the odds of mr @entity2 becoming the next @entity12 leader from 5/1 to 9/4 , while @entity121 said it was a clear sign the @entity123 were turning in on themselves with mr @entity35 powerless to intervene			1
there was speculation last night that should mr @entity2 be elected and the @entity123 win the election with a comfortable majority , he could be offered a ministerial job at @entity295 or another wide - ranging infrastructure role after he has stepped down as mayor .			2

@entity96 insists he has learned how government works in 8 years
he announced yesterday that he wants to stand as an mp in 2015
said he had ' danced around it for a very long time ' but is looking for a seat
widely expected to become a cabinet minister and run as @entity12 leader
@entity124 warns voters bumbling @entity2 is *fiercely* ambitious
' messy hair is like his ambition ... pretends he does n't care but really does '
@entity2 finally admitted he will stand for election to @entity7 in 2015
