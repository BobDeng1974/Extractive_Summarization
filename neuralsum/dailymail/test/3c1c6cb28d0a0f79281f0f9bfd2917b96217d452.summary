@entity0 has been accused of treating the public with ' contempt ' after dismissing as a ' joke ' the infamous @entity5 note admitting the party had blown the nation 's finances			1
the shadow chancellor said the letter , left in the @entity11 by the former @entity5 minister @entity12 in 2010 , was just a ' jokey note '			1
mr @entity12 's glib note to his successor as treasury secretary stated : ' dear chief secretary , i 'm afraid there is no money			1
kind regards – and good luck ! @entity12			1
when the @entity33 took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than £ 150billion – more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy			2
but mr @entity37 insisted the note admitting that @entity5 had blown the nation 's finances should not be taken seriously			2
he told @entity41 : ' @entity12 's note was a jokey note … of the course the money had n't run out			1
' mr @entity0 said @entity5 would cut the deficit – still running at £ 90billion a year – every year			2
he said : ' nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing			0
i think in tough times , people want a government which will make tough decisions , and will make the sums add up , and that is what we 're saying very clearly today			0
' but he was asked if @entity5 was ' credible ' and could be trusted with the economy			0
mr @entity0 said : ' i think people want to know the sums add up			2
people know that the global financial crisis was n't caused by @entity5 's spending – it was n't @entity5 's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the @entity68 investment bank went bankrupt in @entity69			0
' @entity12 's note was a jokey note , of course the money had n't run out			1
' @entity0 , pictured in @entity73 today , said the letter , left in the @entity11 by the former @entity5 minister @entity12 in 2010 , was just a ' jokey note ' mr @entity0 blamed the @entity78 minister @entity77 for leaking the note			1
he said it was supposed to be a private note , adding : ' it was supposed to be a piece of humour			0
in fact , in that year , the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds , so of course the money had n't run out , but there was a large deficit , and we had to get it down , and we needed to get it down in a fair way			0
' the reason why we 're more credible than the @entity98 now is that they 're not people who understand the need for change in the economy , it 's not been all in it together , they 've not even balanced the books – it 's going to take a @entity5 government to do it			2
' former treasury secretary @entity12 left the note to his successor @entity77 in 2010 the @entity98 this morning slammed mr @entity0 's remarks – claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash			1
treasury minister @entity113 said : ' the fact that @entity0 thinks the debt they left the country was a ' joke ' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in			1
' it is clear @entity5 has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes , more borrowing and more debt			0
' the letter has haunted @entity5 for years , allowing @entity130 and @entity78 ministers to prove the nation 's coffers were empty			0
the letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation 's finances , only a glib ' good luck ' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess			1
written in blue ink on government note paper , it was opened by @entity78 @entity77 who became chief secretary to the treasury when the coalition was formed			1
@entity78 mr @entity77 said : ' he left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the @entity11 when he left it			1
i think it is refreshing that a @entity5 politician has been prepared to admit that			0
' mr @entity12 has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life			2
he said : ' it was a very foolish thing to do			0
' i suppose i did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private			0
' there 's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s			0
i felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage			0

letter was left in the @entity11 by the former minister @entity12 in 2010
it said : ' dear chief secretary , i 'm afraid there is no money . good luck '
@entity0 insists it was just a ' jokey note ' that should not be taken seriously
