@entity0 hopes @entity2 swimmers can prove an inspiration to the next generation of talent with strong performances at the @entity7			1
the @entity9 swimmer recalls that home success at the @entity11 was inspiring for her			1
' i remember watching because the @entity14 team had full red swimming costumes to race in and i was like ' that 's so cool , i want one of those suits ' , ' said @entity0			1
i was 12 at the time , i was like i want to be part of the team			1
i want to be doing that			2
' hopefully everybody who watches this , younger swimmers , will have the same experience i did watching 2002			1
' four years later @entity0 was in the @entity32 herself			1
the 24 - year - old from @entity34 added : ' @entity35 was amazing			2
it was one of the best experiences of my life			2
' fifteen , flying out to @entity40 for three weeks on the @entity41 on a holding camp , two weeks in @entity35 in the @entity43 , then afterwards going to see the other sports , sight - seeing			2
' and i came home with two medals from the relays			1
i was like ' this swimming thing is amazing '			0
' that was my first experience of the senior team			1
it was incredible and still today is one of my favourites			0
' four years later ( in @entity54 ) i was in a totally different position			0
' i 'd won medals at @entity57 , medals at @entity59 , so going into the @entity60 it was kind of like ' okay , what can i do ? i 've got a lot of events , i want to be on the podium in most of those events '			0
' it was a totally different switch of situation			0
i embraced that , but it was hard at the same time			2
the goggles are on : @entity0 will be swimming for @entity14 at the @entity7 ' i got a bit ill while i was there and it was a bit of a difficult situation to be in , but coming home with five medals ( gold in the non-olympic 50metres butterfly , three silvers and a bronze ) you 've got to be happy with that			1
' even though they were n't quite the colours i wanted at the time , looking back it 's actually not a bad achievement			2
' at her third @entity32 , @entity0 is now a veteran of the team and as well as inspiring spectators , she could also use her experience to help the likes of 18 - year - old @entity91 , who has a similarly packed race programme			1
she added : ' it 's a bit surreal			0
i 'm pretty sure half the juniors are a lot more mature than i am			0
' i think there 's 24 people for whom it is their first time			2
they 're all really excited and it 's going to be totally different for them			0
' for me just seeing that and being around that has made it so much more fun , rather than " oh , it 's the @entity32 again "			1
it 's actually really exciting			0
' it 's great to be part of the @entity11 and to swim for @entity14			1
we do n't often get to do that			0
eager : the veteran @entity0 says ' it 's great to be part of the @entity11 and to swim for @entity14 ' @entity18 off to thrilling start & medal table ' i 'm feeling it a bit being a bit older , but it 's nice			1
we 've got a good dynamic on the team			2
it 's a good mix of youth and old people			0
' @entity0 will have five opportunities to impress in @entity129 , in the 50m and 100m freestyle , 50m butterfly , 4x100m freestyle relay and 4x100m medley relay			1
asked if one gold medal in @entity129 would surpass five medals , she added : ' yes , i think it would			0
to be able to stand at the top of the podium , sing the national anthem			0
that would be a great experience			0
' i just want to hit my race plans so my coach ( @entity143 ) does n't tell me off			0

@entity0 wants @entity2 swimmers to inspire at @entity32
@entity0 recalls home success at @entity11 inspired her
' because we did so well it was really enjoyable to watch , ' says @entity0
she adds : ' i was 12 at the time , i was like i want to be part of that team '
