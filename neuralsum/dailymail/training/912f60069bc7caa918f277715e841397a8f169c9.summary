by @entity0 published : 12:11 est , 28 february 2014 @entity2 : 13:46 est , 28 february 2014 a ballerina who was too ashamed to go outside because of her misshapen spine has managed to avoid surgery			1
@entity6 , 19 , feared she would be labelled a hunchback after being diagnosed with scoliosis three years ago			1
her dreams of becoming a professional dancer were shattered when she was told she faced nine hours of spinal surgery to place metal rods in her back			1
@entity6 , 19 , was diagnosed with scoliosis - curvature of the spine - three years ago however , miss @entity6 , from @entity16 , was then referred to @entity18 - based clinic @entity17 where she was offered non-surgical treatment			1
following her treatment at the clinic she has returned to dancing five times a week			2
miss @entity6 said : ‘ @entity17 just took over my life and left me distraught - i was paranoid and insecure about going out in case people were looking at my back			1
‘ i lost all my self - confidence			2
i love dancing - it ’s the way i choose to express myself			0
so when doctors told me i needed to have a major operation i was torn to pieces			0
‘ i knew i wanted to be a professional dancer and it ’s all i wanted to do			0
but the surgery would dramatically reduce my flexibility			2
’ instead , she turned to a non-surgical treatment to improve her condition , and has stunned medics with her remarkable progress			0
when she was diagnosed , ms @entity6 was warned she might need a risky nine hour operation to place metal rods in her back as a way of straightening her spine in a bid to avoid surgery , the ballerina undertook an exercise programme designed to strengthen the muscles in her back			1
this was so successful that she has now returned to dancing five times a week scoliosis causes the spine to develop an s - shaped curve			1
the condition affects about four children in every 1,000 and if left untreated it can lead to fatal heart and lung problems in severe cases			0
current treatments for severe scoliosis centre on having a major operation , which can be risky and involves metal rods being inserted either side of the spine to straighten it			1
instead of surgery , the @entity17 clinic focuses on using a series of individually - tailored muscle exercises in order to treat the condition			2
scoliosis is the abnormal curvature of the spine in an s - shape			1
signs include a visible curve in the spine , one shoulder or hip being more prominent than the other , clothes not hanging properly and back pain			1
@entity83 usually only affects adults with the condition			0
in most cases , the cause of the scoliosis is not known but it can be caused by cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy			0
in the @entity92 , scoliosis affects three to four children out of every 1,000			0
it is also thought that as many as 70 per cent of over 65s have some degree of scoliosis			0
it is more common in women than in men			0
most children with the condition do not require treatment as it is mild and corrects itself as the child grows			0
however , in severe cases the child may need to wear a back brace until they stop growing			2
occasionally , a child needs surgery to straighten their spine			1
in adults , it is usually too late to treat the condition with a back brace or surgery so treatment revolves around reducing pain			1
source : @entity120 miss @entity6 said : ‘ i knew there were huge risks involved with the operation and that there could be a very long recovery period			1
‘ but after just a few weeks of treatment the difference in my posture is obvious , i ca n’t believe how far i ’ve come			0
‘ i was overwhelmed by my final photographs and i am relieved that i am no longer at risk from surgery			2
’ just before miss @entity6 turned 18 , in a last attempt to save her daughter from having major spinal surgery , her mother @entity132 decided to start searching for an alternative treatment			1
it was at this point that she came across @entity17			0
a spokesman for @entity17 said : ‘ current treatment in the @entity92 is to wait until the curve becomes so severe , that the only option left is to operate			0
‘ the major operation is an incredibly risky procedure which involves metal rods being inserted either side of the spine , before the spine is fused solid			1
‘ after endless x-rays and appointments with various specialists @entity6 was told that she would need surgery as soon as possible			1
‘ but after just four weeks of treatment with at our clinic , @entity6 had achieved some remarkable results			1
‘ not only had she managed to stabilise her condition but she had made significant improvements to her posture , physical appearance and lung capacity			0
’ a spokesperson for @entity163 @entity92 said : ‘ with respect to the treatment of scoliosis we always advise that patients follow the advice of a scoliosis specialist			0
‘ the scientific evidence that intensive exercise “ cures ” scoliosis is sparse and unreliable			2
‘ in mild curvatures intensive exercise can improve posture , muscle strength ( thereby supporting the spine more efficiently ) , flexibility , and appearance , but there is no long - term evidence that it will ultimately prevent progression of a curve			1
‘ it is important to remember that the scoliosis is different in individuals and that some may have only very mild curvatures that will not progress			0
before her treatment ( left ) , ms @entity6 was to ashamed to go outside as she was scared of being labelled a hunchback			2
since her treatment ( right ) she says she is really happy with the improvement in her posture ‘ such individuals will therefore benefit from treatments that improve appearance – largely because of positive psychological benefits			0
‘ specialists undertake surgery only if it is essential for the long - term health of the individual , how much of the spine is fused will depend on the position and severity of the curve , and great care and consideration is taken to minimise the effect on spinal flexibility			2
‘ the dangers of surgery are overstated			2
serious complications are very rare indeed			0
‘ staying fit and active and keeping the core muscles strong is highly desirable for everyone , and especially so for people with spinal conditions , however , a life - long programme of specific exercise is a huge commitment , with no guarantee of long - term success			1
