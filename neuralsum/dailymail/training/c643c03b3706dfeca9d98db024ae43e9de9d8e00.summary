by @entity1 reporter published : 00:06 est , 14 july 2013 updated : 05:30 est , 14 july 2013 women jurors are a recent phenomenon in @entity5 history and until the 1960s , numerous states still prohibited women jurors as the thinking was that women 's place was in the home , not in the jury box			1
a jury of six women , five of them white and the other a minority , decided @entity18 was not guilty in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager , @entity20			1
now , many are now asking are questioning how the all - female jury affected the outcome of the trial			1
the women have spoken : @entity18 smiles after a not guilty verdict was handed down in his trial the jurors were chosen during a nine - day selection process are known only by numbers to protect their identities			1
they ranged in age from their 30s to their 60s ; one is hispanic or black and the others are white			1
five of the women are mothers			1
before the trial began , one defense expert stated that the six women chosen to sit on the jury could be sympathetic to @entity18 's fate , although their views on guns , crime and community are more relevant in the deliberation room than their gender			1
@entity51 , a @entity52 defense attorney who was lead defense counsel on the @entity54 case said an all - female jury was a ' slam - dunk ' for the defense from the very start			2
not guilty : a crowd gathers as prior to the verdict being delivered			2
some saw an all - women jury as a ' slam dunk ' for @entity18 's defense team ' i think the defense clearly won the day on this one , ' @entity51 said			1
' any way you slice and dice it , this is a defense jury			2
' the trial was n't a typical criminal case in that the women were n't be tasked with weighing whether @entity18 shot @entity20 , but whether he was justified in killing the teen			1
for the female jurors , it is their understanding of when it 's appropriate to use deadly force that was key			1
two of the women reported they were familiar with guns			1
one even had the same kind of permit to carry a concealed weapon that @entity18 was issued			2
another of the jurors warned her two adolescent children not to go out at night because of @entity20 's shooting			1
the fact that five were white , and one was @entity94 was probably more of a boost for the defense than the fact they were women			1
during the trial they were known only by numbers , but their names will be released sometime later			2
@entity103 is retired , unmarried and does n’t have kids			2
she has lived in @entity106 for nine years working in real estate and run a call center where she said she had experience resolving conflicts			2
when asked if @entity18 did something wrong by following @entity20 instead of waiting for police , she said : ' yeah , i guess he did do something wrong			2
' @entity115 recently moved to central @entity52 from @entity116			2
she enjoys watching the ' @entity118 ' on television and works as a nurse on an @entity122 ’s section of a nursing home			2
she said she had n’t paid much attention to the shooting			2
she said she has been arrested , but her case was dropped			2
it ’s not clear why she was arrested or exactly what happened to her case , though she said she was treated fairly			2
she is married and has several children			2
a prosecutor described her as ' black or @entity94 ' during jury selection			1

relief : @entity18 's family celebrate as the jury clear him of all charges @entity182 , president of the @entity52 @entity183 and past president of the @entity52 @entity185 agreed			0
' there 's always that notion of men and women viewing things differently - that women can be more sympathetic , or can listen better than men , ' @entity182 said			1
' but i have no idea how to gauge a jury in a case like this , where the facts are not your typical facts			0
' @entity201 , a professor of sociology at @entity203 believes that the all - female jury had no effect on the ultimate decision in this case			0
' research shows that no one juror trait , including gender , is an accurate indicator of how a juror will vote , ' she says			0
' the best predictor of whether a juror will side with the prosecution or defense is a mix of gender , race , ethnicity , religion , political ideology , personality and attitudes			0
' ms. @entity225 the author of ' the @entity5 women 's @entity227 : a more just verdict			1
' she believes that the gender makeup of juries rarely shapes the verdict in a trial			0
@entity18 listens to the charges against him read by judge @entity235 , in @entity106 circuit court during his trial ' women are now full citizens when it comes to jury service			1
if a man is being tried by an all - woman jury , he is likely being tried by a jury of his peers			0
the gender makeup of the jury is not likely to be pivotal in determining the verdict in the @entity18 trial			0
the evidence is what matters in the outcome			0
but our public attention to the fact of an all - female jury shows that we are still conditioned to think in gendered ways , ' she says			0
at the time the jury was selected , @entity257 , a lawyer for the @entity20 family , said , ' with the makeup of this jury , the issue of whether every @entity5 can get equal justice no matter who serves on this jury panel will be answered			0
and we expect the jury pool to do its duty and follow the law , ' he said			0
@entity269 , left , sister of @entity18 , his father , @entity271 , second from left , his mother , @entity273 , second from right , and wife @entity274 , right , sit in @entity106 circuit court prosecutors and defense attorneys chose the panel of six jurors after almost two weeks of jury selection			1
in @entity52 , 12 jurors are required only for criminal trials involving capital cases , when the death penalty is being considered			1
@entity20 's shooting death and the initial decision not to charge @entity18 led to public outrage and demonstrations around the nation , with some accusing @entity291 police of failing to thoroughly investigate the shooting			0
the six jurors were culled from a pool of 40 jury candidates			1
a jury made up entire from women allows armchair trial lawyers to speculate on how gender might have influenced the verdict			1
did the women sympathize with someone who claimed to be in fear for his life ? two of the female jurors themselves own guns for self - defense			1
did they sympathize with the tragic loss of a teenage son ? five of the jurors are mothers			1
these questions evoke the larger and largely unspoken issue at the heart of any jury selection - do women decide cases differently ? @entity320 , left , and @entity321 , the parents of slain teen @entity20 , sit with their attorney @entity323 , right			1

five of the women chosen were white and the sixth was @entity94
five of the six women were mothers
none of the jurors wants to be identified but the *restrictions* will likely be lifted in the coming days
