an explosive new coroner 's report reveals @entity3 star @entity2 sustained bruises to her face and other parts of her body on her yacht before she went overboard and drowned in 1981			1
the new development suggests that foul play could have been involved in @entity12 ' death and that she did n't accidentally fall overboard on her 60 - foot yacht - as the original police investigation concluded			1
the new coroner 's examination asserts that bruises found on the actress ' face , wrists , knees , and ankles occurred before she went into the water - not , as the 1981 report concluded , as she struggled to climb back aboard the yacht after falling over the side			1
those bruises could have been ' non-accidental , ' the medical examiner postulated			0
refusal : @entity30 ( left ) has refused requests by detectives to be interviewed as part of a fresh investigation into the death of his wife @entity2 ( right ) in 1981 party : ms @entity2 , mr @entity30 and actor @entity39 were aboard the boat - along with captain @entity41 ( right ) when she disappeared and drowned beaten : ms @entity2 , seen here in 1962 , had bruises on her wrists , knees and ankles that were consistent with her being beaten , according to a new coroner 's report released in january @entity49 reports that the document pokes numerous holes in the original autopsy reporting and the ruling that her death was accidental - however it stops short of calling her death a homicide			1
the network also claims the @entity59 's new report indicates she was possibly assaulted aboard the yacht			2
@entity30 's publicist , @entity61 , told @entity62 he would not comment on the report			1
@entity65 's detectives reopened their investigation in 2011 after the captain of the yacht claimed that @entity2 's husband , @entity30 , was with her right up until she went overboard			1
her death was ruled ' accidental ' at the time , but in 2012 , the coroner changed the ruling to ' undetermined			1
' the coroner 's office says in the new report that there is not enough evidence at this time to rule on the manner by which @entity2 died			1
however , the report plays special attention to the bruises found on @entity2 's body			1
' the location of the bruises , the multiplicity of the bruises , lack of head trauma , or facial bruising support bruising having occurred prior to entry in the water , ' the report states			0
fatal : this is the yacht splendor that ms @entity2 and mr @entity30 were aboard when the actress went overboard and drowned off @entity94 over @entity95 weekend in 1981 dangerous : ms @entity2 reportedly could not swim			1
her body was found floating in the water near @entity94 hours after she went overboard tragic : new information released in the last couple of years has cast suspicion on the original finding that ms @entity2 's death was accidental ( pictured here with mr @entity30 ) confession : @entity41 , the skipper of the yacht , says he lied to police about what happened the night @entity2 drowned ' since there are unanswered questions and limited additional evidence available for evaluation , it is opined by this @entity107 that the manner of death should be left as undetermined , ' chief medical examiner dr. @entity107 wrote in the report completed in june			1
@entity30 has told investigators that @entity2 , who could not swim , must have fallen in the water when she got up to try to retie a dingy that had been knocking against the side of the yacht			1
he is not considered a suspect by the @entity65			0
@entity2 's body was found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.14 percent , nearly twice the legal limit for driving			2
she was also found to be under the influence of a motion sickness medication and a painkiller , which likely increased her level of intoxication			0
her body was found floating off @entity94 , near @entity59 , several hours later			0
the captain of the yacht , @entity41 , claimed that a fight had broken out between @entity30 and actor @entity39 , who was also aboard to yacht			2
he said that after @entity2 went to bed , he heard the fight continuing in her cabin , including sounds of a physical struggle			0
mr @entity41 claims @entity30 waited several hours after his wife disappeared to call authorities			2
@entity2 , 43 , burst into child stardom in 1947 playing little @entity146 , the girl who did n't believe in @entity147 , in ' @entity148			2
' @entity2 later starred as @entity149 in 1961 's ' @entity150 ' and was nominated for an @entity151 for her role opposite @entity153 in ' @entity154			2
' @entity30 , now 82 , admitted he had a fight with his wife on the night of november 28 , 1981 , but said she was not in her cabin when he went to bed			1
he maintains he had nothing to do with her death , though said he feels personally responsible for not looking after her			0
however , @entity41 reportedly offered an alternate explanation for @entity2 's death			1
@entity164 , the actress ' young sister , claimed to author @entity166 that @entity41 called her and drunkenly confessed that @entity30 allowed his wife to drown			0
' he said it appeared to him as though ( @entity30 ) shoved her away and she went overboard			0
@entity41 panicked and ( @entity30 ) said , " leave her there			0
" @entity41 said he was very panicky that he was sitting and ( @entity30 ) kept drinking and kept drinking			0
‘ and he ’d say , " come on , let ’s get her			0
" and he said ( @entity30 ) was in such a foul mood , at that point , that he then shut up and was waiting for when , when are they gon na go to her rescue , until all the sound stopped , ’ @entity164 is heard telling @entity166 in recordings make for her 2001 book @entity183 : the biography of @entity2			2
@entity164 continues on to say that @entity41 did not think that @entity30 meant for @entity2 to die but he did not ‘ run to her aid			2
’ ' even if he did not kill her , which is what i understand the guy ’s saying , it was – you know , that it – it was an accident , ' @entity164 said			0

she also had motion sickness medication and painkillers in her system , which likely increased her level of intoxication			0
the time of death is estimated at about midnight at on november 29			1
