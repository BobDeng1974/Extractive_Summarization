by @entity0 families should be banned from sending any food waste to landfill , according to a group of mps			1
the controversial proposal , which would see all @entity8 homes forced to use ‘ slop buckets ’ to recycle kitchen scraps , was last night welcomed by green campaigners			2
claiming its aim is to tackle a throwaway society , the @entity12 urged the government to force councils to compost or re-use 100 per cent of food waste			1
’ nearly 7.6million households in @entity36 – 27 per cent of all homes – already have kitchen waste collections			1
but many are reluctant to use them , with just 6 per cent of all food sent for recycling			0
they consider the food caddies unhygienic and messy , and too liable to be knocked over and targeted by vermin			0
@entity44 , founder of the @entity45 , said : ‘ i have a food caddy and i do n’t use it – i do n’t want it sitting in my kitchen and i do n’t want it sitting on the pavement			2
‘ they get full of maggots , they are n’t done up properly and they spill over on the street			0
‘ what i ca n’t see is how councils would enforce a rule like this – bin men are n’t going to go through your wheelie bin to check if there ’s any food in there are they ? ’ the green lobby is keen to see the expansion of food collections and stricter rubbish rules			1
@entity70 campaigner @entity69 said : ‘ we live in a throwaway society we can not sustain			0
with the enormous energy , water and land cost of producing food , particularly meat and dairy products , the committee is absolutely right to propose a ban on food waste to landfill			1
’ the committee ’s report said : ‘ just 400,000 tonnes of food waste is separately collected for organic recycling in the @entity36 out of the 7.2million tonnes thrown out by households every year – around 6 per cent			1
instead this food waste could be collected separately and composted or used in anaerobic digesters to produce biogas and renewable energy and fertiliser			1
’ the report also criticised councils ’ inconsistent recycling schemes , which it said should be standardised across @entity8			0
it also proposed lower vat on recycled products and longer warranties for consumer goods			0
but the report was dismissed by the government as @entity100 , which has authority over @entity8 ’s councils , has tried to bring back weekly bin collections and simplify the recycling system			1
but it has faced resistance from authorities trying to cope with reduced costs while meeting tough @entity111 recycling targets			0
@entity112 , who was appointed communities minister in last week ’s reshuffle , said : ‘ we do n’t agree with these calls which would result in a proliferation of bins			0
‘ rather than bullying families with unfair fines and confusing bin rules , councils should be providing regular and comprehensive rubbish and recycling collections , especially given people pay a lot of money in council tax			2
’ the @entity129 , which represents councils , said : ‘ there is a strong case for banning not just food from landfill , but also furniture , paints and textiles			2
this will help promote a thriving reuse economy			0
