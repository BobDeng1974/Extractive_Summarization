@entity1 officials are finding it difficult determining how effective @entity4 airstrikes against @entity5 in @entity6 and @entity7 are because of ' significant gaps in intelligence '			1
senior current and former @entity4 officials have told the @entity11 that @entity4 aircraft are running under less restrictive rules than those governing drone strikes in @entity16 and @entity17			1
despite this , they are having difficulties determining the effectiveness of the bombing missions targeting @entity22 and @entity5 due the lack of intelligence assets on the ground			1
these assets identify targets before an airstrike and conduct an after action battle damage assessment			0
but independent analysts say @entity5 remains on the offensive in areas of @entity6 and @entity7 , where it still controls large sections			2
and according to witnesses , @entity4 airstrikes have at times hit empty buildings that were long ago vacated by @entity53 fighters			1
human rights groups also say coalition airstrikes in both countries have killed as many as two dozen civilians			1
@entity4 officials say they ca n't rule out civilian deaths but have n't confirmed any			1
rear admiral @entity60 said : ' we do take extreme caution and care in the conduct of these missions			0
but there 's risk in any military operation			0
there 's a special kind of risk when you do air operations			0
' military officials acknowledge that they are relying mainly on satellites , drones and surveillance flights to pinpoint targets , assess the damage afterward and determine whether civilians were killed			1
that stands in sharp contrast to the networks of bases , spies and ground - based technology the @entity4 had in place during the height of the wars in @entity6 and @entity89 , officials say			2
as a result , ' it 's much harder for us to be able to know for sure what it is we 're hitting , what it is we 're killing and what it is collateral damage , ' said @entity100 , a retired colonel and former adviser to the @entity102 who is now a fellow at the @entity104			0
in @entity6 , the @entity4 is relying for ground reports on the @entity6 military and intelligence services , whose insights into @entity5 controlled territory are limited			1
@entity4 strike aircraft are targeting @entity5 in @entity6 and @entity7 during round - the - clock missions over hostile territory in @entity7 , the @entity4 is not coordinating the strikes with the main moderate opposition group , the @entity115 , even though it has backed that group with weapons and training , said @entity119 , who follows the conflict for the @entity121			1
the @entity122 is generally unwilling to send @entity4 intelligence officers into @entity7 , and partner @entity125 intelligence services are often focused on their own agendas			2
the intelligence gaps raise questions about the effectiveness of the strikes and about whether the current strategy will achieve the administration 's goal of defeating @entity5			2
the group has begun adapting to @entity4 airstrikes by seeking to conceal itself , move at night and blend in with civilians , @entity1 officials say			1
@entity141 major general @entity140 said : ' they 're a smart adversary			1
' in terms of tracking the movements of militants , @entity4 intelligence coverage of @entity7 and @entity6 is not as good as it was in @entity16 and @entity17 at the height of covert @entity122 drone campaigns there , officials say			1
at the same time , the military 's targeting rules are less restrictive			0
under rules @entity31 announced in may 2013 , no drone strike would occur without a ' near certainty ' that civilians would not be harmed			2
@entity158 spokeswoman @entity157 said that the near certainty standard does not govern @entity4 strikes underway in @entity7 and @entity6			2
it was intended to apply ' only when we take direct action outside areas of active hostilities , ' she said in a statement			0
what 's happening in @entity6 and @entity7 right now is an armed conflict , @entity157 said , and targeting is undertaken in compliance with the international law of war			0
the law of war requires militaries to take precautions to avoid killing noncombatants , but it does not hold them to a near certainty standard			0
after the near certainty standard was imposed on drone strikes in @entity16 and @entity17 , the frequency of strikes dropped precipitously , and the use of so - called signature strikes - attacks aimed at large groups of armed men who fit the profile of militants but whose names were not all known to the @entity122 - was curtailed			0
there have been just nine drone strikes in @entity16 this year , according to @entity190 , a website that tracks the strikes based on media reports			0
the @entity4 has been joined by the @entity194 who have completed their first bombing mission in @entity6 a pair of @entity199 jets spotted an @entity5 armed pick up truck and destroyed it with a @entity203 missile that is down from a high of 110 strikes in 2010			1
the @entity207 , a @entity208 - based group that has been critical of drone strikes , found no instance of civilian casualties in @entity16 in 2013 after the policy took effect			0
the @entity214 , which opposes the @entity7 government , says @entity4 airstrikes have killed up to 19 civilians , including several when bombs hit a grain silo sunday in the town of @entity221			1
in @entity6 , according to a report in by the @entity224 , four civilians were killed in a @entity4 airstrike on sept. 26 in @entity226			0
@entity1 spokesman colonel @entity227 said this week that the @entity4 was investigating the reports of civilian casualties but that , so far , ' we 've found nothing to corroborate ' that civilians have been killed			1
the @entity4 has relied on intelligence - gathering technology - or @entity234 , which stands for ' intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance ' - such as satellites , drones and overhead surveillance flights to determine whether there have been civilian casualties			1
few if any human spotters are believed to be on the ground assessing the results of @entity4 and coalition airstrikes			2
@entity227 acknowledged that the @entity1 could not say for sure that every person killed in the bombing of @entity6 and @entity7 has been a combatant			2
he said : ' the evidence is going to be inconclusive often			0
remember , we 're using @entity234 to determine the battle damage assessment			0
' @entity253 , the top @entity7 analyst with the @entity254 in @entity255 , said the @entity257 reports are generally regarded as credible			0
she said : ' i think it is likely that airstrikes will inevitably result in some civilian casualties			0

president @entity31 has *loosened* the rule of engagement for bombing @entity5
@entity141 major general @entity140 said : ' they 're a smart adversary '
human rights activists claim @entity4 airstrikes have already claimed civilian lives
@entity1 officials admit they are hampered by the lack local intelligence
@entity4 aircraft are relying on target *information* from drones and satellites
officials *unsure* whether @entity5 buildings still occupied at the time of a mission
