by @entity0 , @entity1 published : 13:04 est , 12 february 2013 updated : 14:09 est , 12 february 2013 scientists analysing how magicians @entity3 perform one of the oldest known illusions now reveal that some aspects of the magic trick are even more effective at manipulating audiences than the magicians predicted			1
these findings not only shed light on basic processes such as cognition , but could help advance the art of magic , researchers suggested			1
in recent years , neuroscientists have increasingly been analysing magicians ' performances to gain insights on the human mind			2
@entity23 of the illusionist duo @entity3 performs the cup and ball trick : scientists have revealed that some aspects of the trick are even more effective at manipulating audiences than magicians predicted ' we realized that magicians were among the best people at manipulating attention and awareness , far better than scientists , ' said cognitive neuroscientist @entity38 , director of the laboratory of behavioural neurobiology at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43			1
' so we 've been poaching their techniques , bringing them back to the labs to increase our rate of discovery			2
' the latest magic trick @entity38 and his colleagues investigated is the classic cups and balls illusion			1
examples ascribed to ancient @entity54 conjurers date back to @entity55 , and some claim it goes back further to ancient @entity58			2
the illusion nowadays commonly involves three upside - down cups and three balls , @entity59 can make the balls seemingly jump from cup to cup , disappear from one cup and appear in another , turn into other items and so on			2
( the modern swindler 's version is the shell game			2
) to learn more about this illusion , the researchers enlisted the aid of the famous duo @entity3			1
seven volunteers watched 10 - 12 - second - long video clips of @entity23 performing the illusion in front of a @entity80 tv crew at the duo 's theatre in @entity83			1
the balls in the illusion are typically brightly coloured , while the cups are usually opaque			2
@entity3 practice a version with three opaque and then three transparent cups			1
classic illusion : in the cup and ball trick , magicians can make the balls seemingly jump from cup to cup , disappear from one cup and appear in another , turn into other items and so on ' it 's a great act , and the trick still works even with transparent cups , because they 're just that good — people still ca n't follow all the movements and see how the trick is done , ' @entity38 said			1
' i 've seen them do this trick for more than 20 years , ' said vision scientist @entity108 at @entity109 , in @entity110 , @entity111 ' the best part of the whole routine is that , despite the fact that they are telling you what they are doing — they 're showing you what they 're doing — you 're still amazed because you just ca n't fight the deception			1
' @entity23 devised this variation while fiddling with an empty water glass and wadded - up paper napkins for balls at a @entity128 diner			0
he turned the glass upside down and put a paper ball on top , then tilted the glass so that the ball fell into his other hand			0
the falling ball was so compelling that it drew his own attention away from his other hand , which was deftly and secretly loading a second ball under the glass			0
@entity23 found that the sleight happened so quickly he himself did not realise he had loaded the cup			0
he surmised he missed it because the falling ball captured his attention			0
in the experiments , the volunteers reported when they saw balls get removed from , or placed under , cups by pressing buttons			0
the researchers also used cameras pointed at the eyes of the volunteers to track their gazes			1
the researchers found that while the falling ball did draw audience attention , other aspects of the trick were actually stronger at making the illusion work			1
for instance , audiences were fooled more often when the magician attempted to drop a ball that was stuck to a cup			0
' a lot of times the intuitions we have about the way things work are n't the way things work , ' said @entity108 , who did not take part in this research			0
' this is n't to put down @entity23 — @entity23 's intuition is good			0
there is research we did on a famous sleight of hand known as the @entity182 drop where @entity23 's intuition on how to sell the trick is perfectly correct			2
' misdirection : in the experiments , the volunteers reported when they saw balls get removed from , or placed under , cups by pressing buttons			0
the researchers also used cameras to track the gazes of the volunteers in addition , magicians often say that success with illusions depends on how well they can use gazes and faces to manipulate where audiences look , @entity38 explained			1
the researchers tested this idea by hiding @entity23 's face on the video clips with a black rectangle , and found doing so apparently did not affect the illusion			1
' we 're showing a discovery that magicians missed because they relied on their intuition , and their intuition was wrong , ' @entity38 said			0
these findings support recent studies , including one from @entity38 and his colleagues , which hinted that the facial expressions and other social cues magicians think are crucial to illusions may not actually be essential			1
' a huge amount of training in magic is that social cues matter , ' @entity38 said			0
' we 're starting to wonder if social cues help with any magic tricks			0
future research is warranted to look at the effects of social cues in illusions … we 'd like to see an effect where they really matter			0
' these new findings shed light on how and by how much people can be misdirected , which could help magicians improve their art. @entity38 and his colleagues @entity236 and @entity238 detailed their findings online feb. 12 in the inaugural issue of the journal @entity242			1

researchers analyse audience *reactions* to clips of @entity3 performing the trick
they find that facial expressions and other misdirections illusionists use are not crucial to the success of the trick
new findings shed light on how and by how much people can be misdirected
