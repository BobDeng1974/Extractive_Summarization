@entity0 was last night under intense pressure to deliver on his promise to hold a judge - led inquiry into @entity6 complicity in torture			1
as the clamour for an independent investigation mounted , the prime minister was condemned for insisting a @entity12 committee should do the job even though it presided over an alleged whitewash in the treatment of terror suspects			1
an alliance of nine human rights groups said only a judicial probe could get to the truth of the disturbing questions raised by an explosive @entity24 @entity23 report which laid bare the barbaric treatment of detainees by the @entity27			1
in a letter to @entity30 , seen by the @entity31 , the organisations blasted the @entity33 ’s decision to allow @entity35 ’s @entity34 ( @entity36 ) to investigate the @entity6 ’s ‘ shameful ’ involvement in @entity24 wrongdoing			2
@entity0 was last night under intense pressure to deliver on his promise to hold a judge - led inquiry into @entity6 complicity in torture			1
pictured : @entity43 nine human rights groups told @entity0 only a judicial probe could get to the truth of @entity6 's role in torture by the @entity27 it said the @entity36 was inadequate to look into allegations that , during the war on terror , @entity6 agents colluded in extraordinary rendition – where suspects are moved to secret prisons around the world for torture – and turned a blind eye to abuse of captives			1
the joint letter was sent to @entity62 as the spotlight once again fell upon the case of @entity65 , the @entity6 resident who has been held in @entity43 for almost 13 years			1
@entity24 president @entity66 said holding people in the camp ‘ continues to inspire jihadists around the world ’			0
over the weekend , four @entity71 were sent home leaving around 130 detainees , including father of four mr @entity65			0
mr @entity0 has been under growing pressure to order a judge - led inquiry since the @entity79 report earlier this month detailed @entity27 beatings , waterboarding , hanging and the rectal feeding of detainees			1
but it had been stripped of any mention of the @entity6 security services or @entity87 , the @entity6 territory in the @entity89 that @entity90 admitted was used for at least two @entity24 rendition flights			2
@entity65 , the @entity6 resident who has been held in @entity43 for almost 13 years @entity93 agents have also been accused of being present when terror suspects were tortured			1
compelling evidence has also emerged that @entity87 was used to hold prisoners			0
the letter , signed by human rights charities including @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , said neither the @entity36 inquiry , nor its predecessor , begun by sir @entity105 but controversially axed by the government last year , ‘ came up to the mark ’			1
it said mr @entity0 had shamefully ‘ u-turned ’ on his 2010 vow to hold a judge - led inquiry to probe into the sickening abuse claims			2
at the time , the prime minister said the @entity36 could not be independent and would not inspire public confidence			0
the @entity36 cleared @entity114 and @entity93 of involvement in extraordinary rendition in 2007			0
the letter said : ‘ the publication of the report by the @entity79 has highlighted not only the horrors of the @entity27 ’s torture programme , but also the @entity6 ’s failure as a country to put our own house in order			1
we therefore urge you to deliver on your promise of an independent , judge - led inquiry with the powers necessary to get to the truth , before next year ’s general election			0
’ last night , president @entity66 said he remained committed to trying to close @entity43 by 2016			2
that would mean finding a solution to the wrangle over mr @entity65 who the authorities wish to send to his native @entity140 , even though his @entity6 family live in @entity142			2
a @entity6 soldier was investigated for possible war crimes for simply thrusting a piece of paper at a @entity149 fighter , it has emerged			2
he was accused of abuse for touching the terror suspect on the nose with the sheet during a routine interrogation in @entity71			0
the fighter was suspected of being a potential ringleader in the murder and mutilation of four @entity159 soldiers in 2008			0
but it was the intelligence officer – who had an exemplary record – who ended up being investigated amid claims that he had broken rules banning the touching of prisoners during interrogation			0
and another interrogator was probed for shouting in a suspect ’s ear , it was claimed			0
a former senior @entity175 interrogator said the investigations were both ‘ ridiculous ’ .			0
