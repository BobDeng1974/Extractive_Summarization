he said : ‘ if you stay on top of your fitness you should really be able to pass			0
if i ’m honest , it ’s not unbelievably hard			0
‘ it is average level , you do n’t need to be superhuman to complete it			0
‘ to be a soldier you need to be extremely fit and robust and should be able to deal with any sort of physical challenge			0
‘ i think a lot more people should be passing it and not failing			0
’ ' it ’s their job to be fit and well to look after our country			0
' - professor @entity107 mr @entity84 , who also serves as a firefighter for @entity109 , said large amounts of food on offer at army bases could be responsible for some troops letting their fitness levels slide			1
he said : ‘ there is a big culture of eating in the army			0
‘ you want to load the calories in for energy levels but that ’s all good and well when you ’re training lots and staying on top of your fitness but if you ’re not doing anything , that ’s where the problem lies			2

’ the former soldier , who served in the @entity132 , also said those who serve for the country should want to take pride in their fitness			2
he said : ‘ on a personal level , i think all of those in our forces should have higher fitness levels including police and firefighters			1
‘ i find it disappointing to see soldiers who ’ve let themselves go and are not taking pride in their fitness			2
‘ i firmly believe you should look after yourself and keep on top of your fitness levels all of the time			1
‘ you realise the public might see some soldiers in their beret and uniform , perhaps at a service station or somewhere , and see they ’ve let themselves go a little and they will wonder “ is that what the @entity3 is nowadays ? " ‘ it ’s not good in that sense			1
’ a @entity13 spokesman said the figures represented only a small number of troops serving between march 2011 and march this year and said training and support was offered to all service personnel ( file picture ) professor @entity107 , chairman of the @entity168 , said the figures were ‘ worrying ’			1

it seems to me that it ’s one of the most basic parts of their role , the tools of their practice			0
’ however , a @entity13 spokesman said the figures represented only a small number of troops and said training and support was offered to all service personnel			1
he said : ' this figure represents 11 per cent of the @entity3 serving in that period and many of those who failed will have subsequently passed their fitness test			1
