when @entity4 's best friend suggested she should do a photo shoot to boost her confidence , after much thought , the naive girl , who was a teenager at the time , decided to strip down for a series of arty nude shots			1
and she was so thrilled with the photos that she decided to share them with her then boyfriend			1
her confidence was completely destroyed when the pictures were circulated around the world via a revenge porn website			1
' my privacy , my intimacy , my body had been completely violated			2
the pictures were taken and shared with trust			1
' i 've felt embarrassed and ashamed , but i was wronged and there should be some justice for that			2
' now she is sharing her story and the pictures in question herself as part of her campaign against revenge porn			1
she explains : ' i want to raise awareness about revenge porn - it 's a life - ruining problem that needs to be policed			1
' ' my images are out there for everyone to see , you can search and find them			2
what difference does it make if the images appear in a newspaper or on a news site if they ’re already everywhere else ? ' i do n't mind if it makes another girl stop and think before sharing intimate photographs			1
' peers rejected calls to create a new criminal offence of revenge porn , as it was ' covered by existing laws ' days after the images went live @entity4 was left devastated when trolls messaged her mum for @entity4 , it was n't just about the photographs , it was about the vile trolling that followed in the aftermath of their publication			1
' i was called a whore and slut and told how ugly i was			2
i have been discussed like a piece of meat , ' says the traumatised young woman			2
' i would get messages from perverts who would say i 'm going to come and find you , or i ca n't wait to rape you			2
it left me completely shocked , i was afraid to leave my home			2
' i stayed in the house for weeks after images went up			2
my full name and @entity97 information had been shared , making me even more vulnerable			2
' it has completely shattered my confidence			2
i did n't want to have sex with my current boyfriend because i felt judged , and paranoid and the thought of being naked filled me with anxiety			2
' last month the @entity104 discussed making serious changes to social media which would mean establishing the identity of account holders - stripping internet trolls of their anonymity			1
however the peers rejected calls to make ' revenge porn ' a criminal offence , as it was judged to be adequately covered by existing obscenity and harassment laws			1
but they insisted clear guidance was needed for police and prosecutors to help them secure convictions			0
it has led to calls from some campaigners - including @entity126 - for the @entity127 to follow the example of a number of states in the @entity131 where laws aims at stopping revenge porn have been introduced			1
ministers say scorned exes submitting revenge porn is a growing problem and claim they will only take action if they have public backing			1
but for @entity4 , a welfare officer , a change in the law could n't come sooner			1
she said : ' it is despicable that there has been no law to protect me and other girls in situations like this			0
' you 'd be arrested if you went to the park and took pictures of other people 's kids			1
' why was it okay for someone to upload my private and intimate pictures to a website without my permission ? ' there should be privacy laws or anything that stops this from happening			1
it should n't have happened to me and it should n't happen to anyone else			0
' at the time @entity4 was thrilled with the photos and decided to share them with her boyfriend sharing her ordeal @entity4 told how she first discovered the images when she was left baffled by endless online friend requests and a stream of sexually explicit messages on @entity97			1
reading through the trolled posts she was left horrified when she discovered links to her naked photos plastered across a vile revenge porn site			1
but @entity4 was to suffer further humiliation			1
days after the images went live she was left devastated when trolls messaged her mum			0
sharing the naked pictures and claiming she had ' raised a whore ' men from across the world contacted @entity185 , 43 , asking for sex with her daughter			1
' can you imagine having to explain to your mum why there are naked pictures of you on the internet ? ' said @entity4			1
' or worse still , having some pervert pose as one of your friends on @entity97 , add you , just to find members of your family to message them the photos			0
' my mum was devastated for me			0
she is hugely protective , like any mum she 's like a lioness with her cub she just wanted to kill the person who did it			1
' she 's tried everything to take them down			2
she has been hugely supportive of me , but no mother should have to see their daughter associated with a site like this			0
' no mum should be told their little girl is a slut or be asked if she is willing to paid so they could have sex with me			0
' @entity4 and her mother @entity220 , who was devastated for her and hugely protective @entity4 was a typical teenage girl struggling with how she looked when a model friend advised she do a naked shoot to boost her body confidence			1
the tasteful portfolio of pictures was never intended for public use			2
feeling flirty and exhilarated with her new - found confidence she was quick to share the images with her then boyfriend			0
last year she began dating new boyfriend @entity230 , 24 , and she thought nothing more of her naked pictures			2
but @entity4 was left rocked when messages started filtering into her ' other ' message box on @entity97 from men in @entity131 , @entity236 and across the @entity127 linking back to a certain revenge porn site			1
frightened in her own home and desperate to have the pictures taken down , @entity4 contacted the website only to be told it would cost £ 240 ( $ 400 ) to have the images removed			1
but it was too late - just two days later , her naked images were appearing across social networks and circulating amongst people she knew			0
@entity26 added : ' there was no stopping it , even if i tried to take them down they were every where			0
people could @entity253 and find me naked on the internet			0
' its terrifying because you have no control and it ruins your life			0
' i felt hugely ashamed , i could n't be naked , i hated my body			0
' ultimately i was embarrassed			0
' @entity4 with her current boyfriend @entity230 , 24 , who she started dating last year the site in question is a @entity131 domain designed for scorned lovers to get back at their exes by posting their most intimate , personal and degrading pictures or videos			1
unfortunately victims are unable determine who was responsible for their individual ' ex ' post , as website disguises any ip addresses shielding the original source			0
while the site is the hub of the images , it accepts no responsibility for its content and will only remove pictures if they are of minors or a fee is paid			2
' sites like this are dangerous			0
' she said , ' girls need to think more carefully about the images they take of themselves because once they are out there , there really is no going back			0
' it should be illegal			0
' struggling to come to terms with her daughter 's ordeal , mother @entity220 , also from @entity27 said : ' when i saw the images on the website , initially i felt sick , the comments were horrendous			2
' the first message i got on @entity97 said something along the lines of " look what someone has done to your daughter " along with abuse			0
' i was very shocked and upset for @entity4			1
' me and her boyfriend @entity230 have had other messages since , offering money or calling her names which is despicable			0
' but my biggest concerns are that her details have been shared			0
' people know her in her home town , and i am glad that her grandparents do n't do social media			0
i worry it could potentially affect her future employment but hope that people are n't so narrow - minded			0
' ' after seeing some of the images i am not surprised by stories of suicides			0
it is probably the most humiliating thing you can do to someone			0
' in 2011 @entity333 , 27 , is thought to have created the first ever so - called revenge porn site called @entity337 that featured naked selfless alongside victims @entity97 profile shots , visitors to the site knew exactly who they were looking for and how to contact them			1
while many women had fallen victim of revengeful exes posting onto the site many claimed their images had been posted as a result of their social media and email being hacked			0
@entity333 , who became known as the most hated man on the internet , profited more then $ 13,000 a month in advertisement from the site , which he dubbed @entity356 , before it was shut down by an anti-bullying charity , @entity357 , in 2012			0
but the precedence had been set , and soon after anonymous revenge porn pages began to pop up across the internet and social media			1
there are few statistics relating to porn revenge cases in the @entity127			1
however new findings by @entity131 - based @entity366 revealed that nine per cent of @entity131 mobile phone users had sent a suggestive picture of video , while 20 per cent had received one			0
the figures had risen from 2012 - when six per cent of phone users had sent a text which was sexual in nature , also called a sext , and 15 per cent had received one			0
only three per cent of people admitted they had forwarded a sext			0
in the @entity127 revenge porn is on the rise but legal action can only be taken if the pictures taken are deemed a breach of copyright law , harassment , or the subject of the pictures is under 18 .			1

@entity4 , 22 , from @entity28 , was humiliated when pictures went online
she 's now decided to publish pictures to raise awareness of the issue
@entity104 just rejected calls to make ' revenge porn ' a criminal offence
