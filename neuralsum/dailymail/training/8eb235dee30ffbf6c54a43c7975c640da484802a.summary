by @entity0 published : 17:39 est , 19 october 2013 updated : 17:41 est , 19 october 2013 three @entity1 will stand trial next week for the alleged murder of a @entity5 prisoner held in their custody in @entity8			1
the commandos , who for security reasons can only be identified as @entity12 , are accused of the suspected execution of a wounded enemy combatant at a @entity16 base			1
the case , which is the first time @entity16 troops have been charged with murder in the 12 - year conflict , is considered so sensitive that prime minister @entity21 has been briefed on its progress by defence secretary @entity23			1
the incident first emerged after civilian police officers found footage on a @entity28 's laptop while investigating entirely unrelated crime			2
the video appeared to show @entity9 standing over a captive and discussing his fate - the @entity8 had apparently suffered injury during a shootout with @entity16 forces			2
@entity1 will stand trial next week for the alleged murder of a @entity5 prisoner ( @entity16 military vehicles pictured in @entity8 ) civilian police officers informed the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) of their concerns and a major investigation was launched			2
the @entity42 then cross-referenced the video evidence with reports of enemy engagements at that location on or about september 15 , 2011			1
a year later seven @entity1 were arrested and five were charged under military law with the ' murder of an unknown captured person '			0
the @entity53 later dropped the murder charges against two @entity1			0
the court martial at @entity56 , @entity57 , is scheduled to start on wednesday with the evidence expected to be heard until november 15			0
more than 63,000 people have joined a @entity61 group set up to support the @entity1 linked to the incident			0
fears remain that the case will be exploited for propaganda purposes by @entity16 - based terrorists			0
for this reason , judge advocate @entity67 is expected to rule that anonymity orders for the three @entity1 should remain in place for the duration of legal proceedings			0
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			1
