he said : ' it would be understandable if it was a foreign driver but it was n't a foreign car			2
' the roundabout is quite near @entity32 so maybe they had just come back from @entity34 and forgot they were on the wrong side of the road			2
' he was driving at about 30mph			2
he just had a normal expression on his face , he did n't look panicked or anything			0

' the problem with the roundabout is its quite big and fast , so cars go around about 25 - 30mph			2
