@entity0 has apologised after accidentally referencing 9/11 in a new poster for @entity2			2
the studio shared the poster on tuesday through its official @entity6 page , which showed the four turtles diving from an exploding building alongside the date it hits @entity11 cinemas - september 11			1
the unintentional , but unmistakable connection to the terrorist attacks on @entity15 's @entity14 was met with swift backlash and outrage on social media , and was deleted shortly after the oversight was pointed out			0
' we are deeply sorry to have used that artwork for the marketing materials promoting the september 11 opening in @entity0 , ' the statement said			1
' we intended no offence and have taken immediate action to discontinue its use			0
' the film , which stars @entity50 and @entity51 , is released in august in the @entity52 and october in @entity53 , but its @entity11 release date comes exactly 13 years to the day after 19 hijackers took control of four airliners and carried out the deadly september 11 attacks			1
the controversial poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks , which claimed the lives of 2,996 people			1
one of the @entity6 replies , posted by user @ @entity67 said : ' so who 's getting fired for this poster art ? september 11 ? exploding buildings ? people falling out of them ? le sigh '			2
another message by @ @entity73 added : ' guys			0
sept 11 and exploding buildings is a bad look okay ' , while a third tweet , by @ yilmaz16 , said : ' really 9/11 ? jumping out of an exploding building ? ' @entity36 has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster , and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release			0
advice : the reason the poster proved controversial was due to the unfortunate release date of september 11 and the use of an exploding building to promote the film anger : the poster was shared on @entity0 's @entity6 page last night , and immediately drew dozens of negative comments from angry film fans outrage : @entity36 has since deleted its original message showing off the movie poster , and has tweeting several considerably less controversial images from the upcoming release resemblance : the poster evoked anger due to its visual similarity to the 9/11 terror attacks ( pictured ) , which killed 2,996 people in 2001 after @entity15 's famous @entity14 were struck by two aircraft coming up to 13 years ago , there was a period of between one and two hours before they collapsed during which dozens if not hundreds of people were seen leaping and falling to their deaths from the burning buildings			1
out of the 2,996 people killed in the four coordinated attacks , 11 of them were @entity11 citizens			0
as yet @entity36 has issued no statement or apology about the controversial poster , nor has it made any explanation of the decision to release the new film on the anniversary of the attacks .			0

@entity2 film is released on september 11 in @entity0
official poster promoting release evokes *memories* of 9/11 terror attacks
heroes are seen falling from a *skyscraper* as it explodes behind them
@entity6 users described the promotion as ' bad taste ' due to release date being on 13th anniversary of 9/11 terror attacks that claimed 2,996 lives
