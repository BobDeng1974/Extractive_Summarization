by @entity0 assistant coach @entity1 has revealed @entity2 will again consult the @entity3 over the performance of referee @entity5			0
the @entity7 management were unhappy with how @entity5 handled the scrum in their first @entity10 hiding against @entity12 on saturday			1
@entity2 had been confident of keeping on the good side of the @entity14 , having previously sought @entity3 clarification over @entity5 's decision to continually penalise and eventually yellow card @entity17 in the @entity20 loss to @entity21 at @entity22			1
disappointed : wales are upset about the decisions of @entity5 ( right ) during their heavy defeat but they encountered further issues in the 38 - 16 reverse at @entity29			1
' we are seeking a bit more clarification on the scrum from ( @entity3 referees ' boss ) @entity36 , who i will meet again this week , ' said former hooker @entity1			2
' i do n't want to be too critical because there are a lot of things for referees to look at			0
it 's the specifics of the technical aspects of the scrum			2
' there are a couple of times when we 've been penalised and we want to make sure we 're seeing the same things as the referee			2
' we met @entity5 before the game and still those decisions went against us			0
we just need to clarify things			0
' but the tourists know @entity5 's performance in no way influenced the outcome in @entity59 , where @entity2 were blitzed by the @entity12			1
and fly - half @entity60 admitted the @entity2 camp are hurting after being swept aside with ease			1
' it is hugely disappointing to lose any game , but what made it worse was it felt like @entity12 did not have to work particularly hard for any of their points , ' he said			1
dejected : the @entity7 players watch on after a @entity73 try in the 38 - 16 defeat on saturday ' they are an outstanding team , they were clinical and if you give these sides a sniff they will take it			1
' but what can we do ? give up this week and take another hammering or do we roll our sleeves up , show a bit of mental toughness and togetherness and try and go out to put in a spirited performance and upset the odds			2
' that is the view we are taking			0
that 's the way to go rather than feeling sorry for ourselves and thinking it will be same again			0
' we are hoping it wo n't be , we have dusted ourselves down , we have some very strong characters in this camp and we want to surprise the ' boks on saturday			0
' the disappointing nature of @entity2 ' performance was only added to by the experience on show in the starting xv			0
improvement : @entity60 , who scored 9 of @entity2 ' 16 points , says they must be better in the second test @entity2 could call on over 700 test caps and 10 @entity106 but were miserably off the pace			1
it leaves head coach @entity108 and company with a major selection dilemma given the strong displays of youngsters like scrum - half @entity113 , wing @entity115 , prop @entity117 and full - back @entity118 on tour			1
lock @entity121 admits there will be plenty of nerves around the camp ahead of the team announcement for the second test			2
he said : ' we are over here with a big squad , because of the midweek game , so the options are there for the coaches if they want to make changes			0
' after what happened on saturday , i guess there will be quite a few nervous boys come team selection day on thursday			0
