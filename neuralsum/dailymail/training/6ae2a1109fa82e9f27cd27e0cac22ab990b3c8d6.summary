the federal government plans to begin taking the temperatures of travelers from @entity3 arriving at five @entity5 airports in order to screen them for @entity7 , but the @entity8 said wednesday that federal agents will only screen about 150 passengers per day			1
@entity8 press secretary @entity11 said the five airports cover the destinations of 94 percent of the people who travel to the @entity5 from the three heavily hit countries in @entity3 – @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
it has been just ten days since a @entity16 man was rushed to a @entity23 , @entity22 hospital with the first case of @entity7 diagnosed on @entity5 soil			0
he was pronounced dead on wednesday morning			0
@entity27 director dr. @entity26 told reporters wednesday that ' as long as @entity7 continues to spread in @entity3 , we ca n't make the risk zero here			1
' dialed in : president @entity31 participated in a conference call wednesday with state and local officials to discuss the @entity7 epidemic in @entity3 coming to @entity5 : @entity36 , seen here with a female relative shortly after landing at @entity39 , traveled to the @entity5 to marry his longtime love @entity41 but extra @entity7 screening will be put in place at @entity45 's @entity44 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity50 @entity49			1
' these five airports are the destination of 94 percent of individuals who travel to the @entity5 from the three countries that are currently affected by @entity7 , ' @entity11 said in a news briefing			0
the new targeted screening regime will only apply to inbound international travelers who have visited ebola - hit nations			1
the plan calls for ' targeted questions , temperature checks and contact information ' collected in airports , according to @entity65 deputy secretary @entity64 , who joined @entity26 in the press conference via telephone			1
@entity11 called the administration 's strategy ' an additional layer of screening that can be targeted to that small population in a way that will enhance security but also minimize disruption to the broader traveling public			0
' the @entity27 announced wednesday that the federal government will start an ' enhanced ' screening protocol targeting about 150 inbound airline passengers every day who arrive from @entity18 , @entity16 or @entity17 , or who have passed through those countries			1
the @entity27 says that 94 per cent of @entity5 - bound airline passengers arrive in @entity5 at one of just five airports , so they are limiting the new plan to those locations			2
the @entity27 says all passengers headed out of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are already screened before they are allowed to board airplanes			0
so far 77 of them have been stopped from boarding because they had fevers			0
but most of these people were diagnosed with malaria – a very common illness in @entity3 – not @entity7			2
malaria is not communicable from one person to another , and is spread by contact with infected mosquitos			0
the @entity31 administration , and the @entity27 specifically , have said repeatedly that it would be counterproductive to restrict air travel from western @entity106 nations where @entity7 is running rampant			2
prohibiting the entry of commercial flights from that region , the government claims , would limit the options for sending supplies and relief personnel back to where they are needed			1
the @entity27 did not immediately respond to a question after the press conference about why military aircraft are n't used for that purpose			1
president @entity31 has already dispatched close to 4,000 military personnel to @entity16 to help with constructing field hospitals and other mission - critical activities			0
he said wednesday during a conference call with state and local government leaders that ' in recent months , thousands of travelers arrived here from @entity3 , and so far , only one case of @entity7 has been diagnosed in the @entity5			1
' ' and that ’s the patient in @entity23 who we know , sadly , passed away , ' @entity31 noted , ' and our thoughts today are with his family			0
' in his press conference , @entity26 led with confident gusto , insisting that ' we have stopped every @entity7 outbreak until this one			0
' ' the only people with @entity7 in the @entity5 are in hospitals , ' he said			2
but he admitted that the @entity65 will be testing a ' particularly small ' group of people			0
' we 're talking about 150 travelers per day , ' he said			0
@entity26 also conceded that the new measures might not have flagged @entity16 national @entity36 , the @entity5 ' index patient ' who died wednesday ten days after entering a hospital isolation ward			1
@entity36 lied about his contact with a contagious @entity7 patient when he left @entity16 en route to @entity152 , @entity153 and finally @entity23			2
' it is true that the index patient , when he left @entity3 , did not have a temperature , ' @entity26 said , and also seemed healthy when he arrived in the @entity5 the ' additional questions ' he would have faced if he arrived today instead ' may have identified him as a contact , ' the @entity27 chief insisted , but could n't say with certainty whether the outcome would have been different			1
taking their temperature : @entity27 director dr. @entity26 talked to reporters wednesday about new procedures for screening inbound airline passengers doctor 's ( @entity168 ) office : @entity31 participated in an @entity7 - related conference call on wednesday the new strategy , he said , is intended to ' increase the likelihood that if someone arrives and develops @entity7 , they will be rapidly identified and isolated			1
' @entity64 said @entity176 agents – the same cadre of officials responsible for screening luggage for contraband – are handing out information sheets to travelers with details of what symptoms to look for and directions to call doctors if they become sick within 21 days – the incubation period for @entity7			1
homeland security agents at airports and other ports of entry already had begun observing travelers coming into the @entity5 for potential signs of @entity7 infection , he emphasized			1
the fact sheet to be given to arriving travelers says : ' you were given this card because you arrived to the @entity5 from a country with @entity7			2
' it tells passengers to ' please watch your health for the next 21 days ' and to ' take your temperature every morning and evening , and watch for symptoms of @entity7 , ' which are listed on the sheet			0
homeland security secretary @entity206 said customs agents ' will continue to observe all travelers entering the @entity5 for general overt signs of illnesses at all @entity5 ports of entry			0

the @entity65 has ordered agents at airports and other ports of entry to observe everyone coming into the @entity5 for potential signs of @entity7 infection , officials said wednesday @entity64 said the department was aware of those issues and is ' taking a layered approach			2
' @entity7 has killed more than 3,400 people in @entity3 and infected at least twice that many , according to the @entity232			2
the virus has taken an especially devastating toll on health care workers , sickening or killing more than 370 of them in the hardest - hit countries of @entity16 , @entity18 and @entity17 – places that already were short on doctors and nurses before @entity7			2
@entity31 has said the @entity5 will be ' working on protocols to do additional passenger screening both at the source and here in the @entity5			0
' ' screening of outbound travelers is already underway ' at airports in the target zone , @entity26 said wednesday			0
