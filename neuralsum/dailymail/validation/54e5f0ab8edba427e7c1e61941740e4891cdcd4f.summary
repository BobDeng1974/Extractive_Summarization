' sources claim that the long rumored tension between @entity3 and the @entity62 hit a high when during the midterm elections many members of the @entity65 refused to be seen campaigning with president @entity3			1
@entity41 is reported to have commented that the defections were linked to the @entity62 , who she believed had begun ' marginalizing the president ' and were ' trying to wrestle control of the @entity73 away from @entity3			1
' she reportedly went out of her way to exact revenge , working to get @entity78 high - profile press opportunities and frequently complaining about the @entity62			2
then , shortly after the midterm elections , she , the president and the first lady , reportedly sat down with @entity19 and told her in no uncertain terms that they planned on remaining neutral during the presidential primary should she run for president			1

' he then added ; ' the @entity100 are behind the e-mail story , and they ’re spreading rumors that i ’ve been with women , that @entity6 promoted people at the @entity115 who ’d done favors for our foundation , that @entity119 had to clean up diplomatic messes @entity6 left behind			0
' and it 's not over yet , as according to @entity39 , six additional probes into @entity19 's performance are underway			2
