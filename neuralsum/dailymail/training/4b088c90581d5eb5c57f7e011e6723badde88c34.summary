by @entity0 published : 12:36 est , 19 april 2013 updated : 13:24 est , 19 april 2013 it 's an age old tradition on the streets of @entity4 in @entity5 , but not one that the average @entity6 expects to see on their lunch break			1
more than 170 members of the @entity11 team clambered on top of one another to make their @entity15 debut this afternoon in an attempt to build a living structure to rival @entity18			1
not a hobby likely to endear itself to health and safety officials , the stunt saw members of the team - men , women and children of all ages and sizes - climb barefoot on the shoulders of their colleagues reaching higher and higher			2
the tradition of building human towers , known as @entity55 has been a popular custom in @entity5 for more than 300 years and is a mainstay of summer festivals around the @entity59 , most specifically in @entity60 and the @entity4 area			1
the bizarre pastime has its roots in aerial dance moves performed at religious festivals centuries ago			0
it originated in @entity67 , near the city of @entity69 , in the southern part of @entity4 in the 18th century and spread throughout the region in the years that followed			1
the base of the living structure , known as the @entity75 , is usually made up of four men who act as a form of safety net and cushion the fall of those above them if things go wrong			0
hold on tight : castellers cling on to each other as they build the top tiers of the human tower reaching the top : the final stages of the tower begin to take shape as it appears to dwarf @entity91 those who are part of the @entity94 have to be strong - they can sometimes bear 770lbs on their shoulders			1
@entity98 , as they are known , then form other levels and the top level is complete when the final climber , usually a small shild known as the enxaneta , reaches their position and puts one hand in the air			0
stages of assembly and disassembly should by completed without stopping			0
towers can reach up to 10 levels high			0
the practice was declared an @entity114 by @entity115 in 2010 and teams compete at competitions between april and september each year			0
@entity118 : the top level is complete when the final climber , usually a small shild known as the enxaneta , reaches their position and puts one hand in the air the tradition is kept alive by some 7,000 castellers who belong to 66 different teams			2
as well as performing close to @entity129 , the @entity11 team also showcased their talents in @entity131 and will perform at @entity132 , the @entity133 in @entity134 and @entity135 throughout the weekend			1
the group performed their daring stunt on top of a building in @entity140 last summer to commemorate the ongoing rebuilding of the @entity142 .			2

the @entity11 built the @entity15 's first human tower
the stunt is an age old festival tradition in parts of @entity4
those at the bottom of the *pyramid* can bear up to 770lb in *weight*
