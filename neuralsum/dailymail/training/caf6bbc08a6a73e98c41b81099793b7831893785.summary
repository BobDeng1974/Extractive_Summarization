the birthplace of iconic @entity8 sports car maker @entity7 has been put on the market for a cool £ 2.5 million			1
number 16 @entity10 is a three - bedroom property tucked away in a posh part of @entity14			2
history : the oldest existing @entity16 and the newest @entity17 outside the birthplace of the classic @entity8 marque , which is on the market for £ 2.5 million apart from the plaque on the door there is little sign that this is where one of the world 's most iconic motoring brands was born and on january 15 , 1913 , it was the base for business buddies @entity29 and @entity7			1
the engineers formed @entity32 and used the property ’s garage as a workshop for the fledgling car manufacturer			1
at @entity38 the duo developed their first model , known as the ‘ @entity40 ’ , completing it in 1915			2
after an impressive performance at the @entity44 hill climb , they decided to rename the firm @entity7			1
it is hard to believe from this posh @entity14 interior , that it was where the first @entity7 was built these sleek interiors and a slice of motoring history could be yours for £ 2.5 million the @entity40 , for all its importance , is no longer thought to exist with records showing it was last registered in 1928			2
but fast - forward 100 years and @entity7 , now based in @entity58 , @entity57 goes from strength to strength having built more than 60,000 high - performance models			1
the owners of 16 @entity63 have now decided to put their home up for sale after living at the address for 17 years			0
it has been put on the market with the @entity70 estate agency for £ 2.5 million			0
this is the equivalent of 78 @entity72 , 30 @entity73 or 13 vanquish models			0
but it is less than the famous @entity76 , which would set you back in excess of £ 2.5 million while a unique @entity79 ’ sold earlier this year for £ 3.2 million			0
spread over 1,217sq/ft , 16 @entity10 boasts three bedrooms including one with ensuite , a large reception room and a kitchen / breakfast room			0
it has an interior designed by @entity86 and still boasts the famous garage while a plaque on the outside of the building shows off its famous past			2
@entity92 , from @entity70 , said : ' we are delighted to be marketing a house with such a historic provenance			0
' our hope is that the eventual buyer is a car enthusiast that continues the use of the car garage , rather than integrating it into further reception space			0
' prior to its use by @entity7 , 16 @entity104 was the @entity106 depot of engineering firm @entity107 and @entity109			1
would - be buyers looking for the badge of authenticity need look no further than the plague on the front of the property @entity116 , chairman of the @entity117 ( left ) and @entity118 , chairman of @entity7 , at the property in @entity14 , @entity106 which was the birthplace of the first @entity7 , and is now on the market			1
