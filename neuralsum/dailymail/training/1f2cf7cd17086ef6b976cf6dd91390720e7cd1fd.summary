‘ for a man who likes electric cars he sure burns a lot of rocket fuel			1
’ these were the words of @entity6 to @entity7 in his guest appearance on @entity9 , humourously citing a supposed conflict of interest between his companies @entity13 and @entity14			1
but in a series of tweets mr @entity7 has hit back at the opinionated cartoon character , explaining why rockets in their current form are the only way to reach orbit			1
@entity22 - born @entity7 has responded to comments made by @entity6			1
he appeared in the latest episode of the @entity9 on 25 january , pictured here in a still from the episode with the @entity9 family			1
in the episode @entity6 cites a potential conflict of interest between his electric car company @entity13 and @entity14 the episode , called ' @entity33 who fell to @entity35 ' , aired on 25 january			1
towards the end of the episode , mr @entity7 takes off in one of @entity14 's @entity39 , leading @entity6 to make her remark			1
but responding to the jibe , @entity22 - born @entity7 said in a tweet : ‘ if u saw @ @entity9 and wonder why @ @entity14 does n't use an electric rocket to reach orbit , it is cuz that is impossible			1
’ in september last year , dreams of taking an elevator into space were given a boost after researchers created ultra-thin , super-strong nanothreads made from diamonds			0
the threads are made up of a long , thin strand of carbon atoms arranged in the same way as the inside of a diamond			0
the discovery could finally be the breakthrough needed to hoist and support cosmic elevators that would transport people into the atmosphere			0
the research was carried out by @entity67 , a professor of chemistry at @entity69 , and the findings were published in the journal @entity72			0
he went on to say the reason is @entity74 , which states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction			0
‘ in a vacuum , there is nothing to “ push ” against			0
you must react against ejected mass , ’ he continued			0
ever since the first rockets launched in the mid- 20th century , people have wondered if there might be an easier way to reach orbit			2
people have dreamed up space elevators , ‘ cannons ’ that could launch vehicles into orbit or electric ion thrusters to slowly raise a spacecraft above @entity35 ’s atmosphere			2
but as mr @entity7 explains , none of these technologies are advanced enough yet to be a feasible alternative to rockets			1
in particular , space elevators have often been seen as a ‘ holy grail ’ of reaching orbit , but no one has yet developed a material that could withstand the huge strain of holding itself together - let alone lift anything into orbit			2
‘ [ please ] do n’t ask me about space elevators until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge , ’ said mr @entity7			1
responding to @entity6 's jibe on twitter , mr @entity7 said rockets were the only way to currently reach orbit			1
he said other methods like electric power were simply ' impossible '			2
and other proposals like space elevators or railguns were not technologically feasible yet @entity7 is ceo of company @entity14 , which builds and operates the @entity122 series of rockets , in addition to the @entity39			1
pictured is a @entity127 rocket lifting off from @entity128 at the @entity129 in @entity130 on 10 january 2015 mr @entity7 is also ceo of electric car company @entity13 , leading @entity6 to cite the supposed public of interest with his gas - guzzling rockets			1
however , as he points out , it 's simply not possible to produce an environmentally friendly way of reaching @entity35 orbit yet , and rockets are the best way to get into space for now @entity7 is the founder of electric car maker @entity13 , and space exploration firm @entity14			1
the @entity22 - born entrepreneur immigrated to @entity142 at age 17			1
he then moved to @entity144 to study at the @entity145			0
mr @entity7 made his first fortune by helping set up money service @entity147			2
in september , @entity14 won a $ 1.6 billion contract with @entity150 to resupply the @entity151 with its rockets and launchers			0
in august 2013 , mr @entity7 unveiled plans for a @entity156 system that would offer a faster way to travel between @entity158 and @entity159			2
mr @entity7 described the concept as a subsonic air travel machine that would stretch approximately 350 miles ( 560 km )			2
it theoretically would let commuters travel between the cities in 30 minutes or less			0
he also has plans to colonise @entity166 and has even said he wants retire on the red planet			0
ion thrusters , meanwhile , are a means of electric propulsion employed on some spacecraft			0
rather than ejecting chemical propellant like a regular rocket , they accelerate ions to create a slow but steady thrust			0
they are used on some spacecraft , such as @entity150 ’s @entity179 currently on its way to the dwarf planet @entity182 , as they can provide sustainable propulsion over a long period of time			0
however , their rate of acceleration is comparable to the pressure a piece of paper exerts on your hand			0
over time , this can accelerate a spacecraft to great speeds - but it is simply not possible to use such an engine to launch a rocket on earth ‘ ion thrusters are great , but have extremely tiny force ( photon thruster even less )			0
must have more thrust than weight or you do n't go up , ’ said mr @entity7			2
and as his final rebuttal , on whether a space cannon could be used to fire a vehicle into space , he said : ‘ anything launched by a railgun ( if you could ever reach ~ @entity213 27 ) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere			0
