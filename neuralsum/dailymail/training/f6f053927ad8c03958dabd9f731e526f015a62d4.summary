by @entity0 ever since she lost 14st three years ago , @entity1 had been unhappy about the size of her breasts			1
but as a single mother with three children , she could n’t afford plastic surgery			2
so when the 26 - year - old heard about a hypnotherapist who said she could make her bust bigger simply by thinking about it , she decided to give it a go – even though it seemed too good to be true			1
getting a boost : @entity1 , 26 , claims that three hypnotherapy sessions with @entity16 have caused her breasts to grow by three cup sizes before : @entity1 was uncomfortable with the size of her breasts , saying they were too small and out of proportion with her figure			1
after : @entity1 is ' delighted ' with her breasts - and the fact she has avoided the knife unlikely as it sounds , miss @entity1 claims the treatment worked , boosting her bra size by three cups from a @entity28 to a @entity29			1
her hypnotherapist , @entity16 , claims he cleared psychological blocks in her mind that were stopping her breasts from growing			1
mr @entity33 , a chartered psychologist , said : ‘ the mind basically controls the body and if you know how to work with the mind you can get it to make changes in the body			1
‘ we know emotions affect the body			2
when people get stressed they get headaches , for example			2
‘ using hypnosis , i can work directly with the mind			2
i speak to the part that controls hormones to encourage growth			2
‘ there are many reasons for these blocks , for instance , during puberty women associate big breasts with unwanted male attention when they were not emotionally ready			1
’ ' i was thinking of having a boob job operation but it looks like i wo n't be needing one now ' : @entity1 says she has gone from a @entity28 to a @entity29 following @entity61 's sessions three years ago , miss @entity1 , a full - time mother from @entity62 , @entity63 , had an operation to have a gastric sleeve fitted , and lost 14st – but her breasts got smaller , too			1
she said : ‘ when i lost all the weight , my boobs went saggy and horrible			0
having three children has ruined them too			0
‘ when i heard about the hypno boob job i felt excited and wanted to give it a go			1
i was sceptical about it at first and it took me a while to get my head around it			0
’ miss @entity1 had three hynotherapy sessions at mr @entity33 ’s office in @entity80			1
the sessions , each lasting an hour and a half , cost £ 900			1
her cup runneth over : @entity1 says she has had to buy new bras to accommodate her new assets satisfied customer : @entity1 with hypnotherapist @entity16 who says he is the only practitioner in @entity90 offering this service having the ' hypno boob job ' : @entity1 says the sessions , where @entity61 claims to unblock the growth hormones responsible for enlarging breasts , were ' relaxing ' unique : @entity61 researched the treatment two years ago after a colleague asked if hypnotherapy would work on her breasts			1
unsatisfied with the treatments on offer he decided to devise his own she said : ‘ i sat in a chair and then i felt really relaxed			0
' the next thing i knew @entity61 was telling me to wake up			0
i felt really refreshed – like i ’d just had a long sleep			0
‘ i did n’t notice any change straight away			0
it was n’t until the second session when i noticed my bra felt tight			0
’ she added : ‘ i feel a lot more confident about my boobs now			0
' a boob job can cost around £ 4,000 but i ’d never have been able to afford that			1
' it goes to show there ’s something out there other than surgery			0
people should give it a go			0
’ but medical experts were rather more sceptical			0
dr @entity125 , a gp from @entity127 , said : ‘ breasts can change for lots of reasons			2
' it can be as simple as being down to weight gain or hormonal changes			0
‘ the possibility that it is as a direct result of hypnotherapy is remote or impossible			0

@entity16 is a chartered psychologist and hypnotherapist
claims to be able to increase a woman 's breasts by three cup sizes
three sessions are recommended for *optimum* results
@entity1 , 26 , says breasts are bigger and firmer after ' hypno boob job '
