they have tattoos , uniforms and the obligatory high - powered machines which mark them out as members of a biker gang			1
but these women are as likely to show off their brilliantly coloured talons as their tats and favour bikes festooned with flowers and painted an attractive shade of pink			1
in fact , the @entity15 girls of @entity16 have rejuvenated a sub-culture that has been in rapid decline since the 1980s			1
also known as the ' kaminari zoku ' ( thunder tribes ) when it began in the 1950s , the group focuses on disrupting traffic in any way possible including running red lights , driving recklessly including speeding and traffic weaving , illegally modifying their bikes and ignoring noise restrictions			0
members are traditionally characterised by their modified motorcycles which often include elements from @entity49 choppers and @entity51 café racer style bikes , as well as their elaborate costumes			2
typically , traditional outfits resemble kamikaze or samurai style jumpsuits , with gang names , mottos and defining symbols and pictures embellished on the back			0
otherwise , retro pilot boots , long overcoats and matching pants style which were a custom of the 70s @entity15 fashion , derived from a combination of old kamikaze and @entity70 uniforms			2
the @entity15 girls bring their own style to gang fashion , however			1
not your typical bikie : @entity15 girls still have tattoos , but their hair and nails are immaculate and polished , their bright bikes normally covered in stickers and multi-coloured gang culture : @entity15 are notorious for wreaking road havoc and modifying their motorcycles to be more elaborate in style and louder than noise restrictions allow @entity89 , multi coloured , pointed nails , bright pink and red bikes adorned with stickers and painted pictures while still maintaining luscious long shiny hair , glossed lips and the typical tattoo			1
the women of these @entity31 gangs say they are breaking away from gender stereotypes by challenging the domestic roles expected of women in modern @entity16			2
in their own words , they are all about proving that ' @entity31 women can wipe their own ass ’			2

this is down from the recorded 42,500 members at the subculture ’s peak in 1982 , according to the @entity146			0
