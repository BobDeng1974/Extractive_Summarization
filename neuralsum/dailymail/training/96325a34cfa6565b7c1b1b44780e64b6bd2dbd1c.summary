by @entity1 reporter club @entity3 managing director at the @entity5 @entity4 believes it is ' embarrassing ' that @entity7 is the only black manager in the @entity8 and has called on the @entity5 to generate more opportunities for ethnic minorities			1
@entity7 took charge of @entity12 earlier this week but his appointment only served to highlight the lack of diversity in the top four divisions of @entity18 football			0
in recent seasons @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 have all managed in the @entity8 but none of them are currently a number one			0
back in the game : @entity7 is now @entity29 manager after a spell out of the game changes afoot : club @entity3 managing director @entity4 wants more opportunities out there and former @entity5 spokesman @entity4 has pointed out that the current record is not good enough and has urged the national governing body to do more			1
' i think for the game it ’s embarrassing that we have only @entity7 as the only black manager in the four divisions , ' he said on @entity43 5 live			1
' the fact is from an @entity5 point of view we ’ve got to be more proactive in this way			0
we ’ve recently had ( former @entity48 assistant ) @entity47 , @entity7 and ( former @entity49 and @entity51 defender ) @entity52 spending certain time with our development teams but we ’ve got to get better than this			0
no laughing matter : @entity7 is the only black manager in the @entity8 after recent changes ' as an industry you ca n’t have such a high percentage of black players and that ’s without looking at other ethnic groups as well - they need to be on boards , on senior management of organisations and they certainly need to be very visible within the coaching staff and the backroom staff of our national teams			2
' @entity4 has also given his backing to @entity74 despite a chastening last few months for the @entity3 manager , who oversaw a woeful @entity77 campaign before his side toiled against @entity79 in front of a half - empty @entity81			2
@entity74 himself has admitted he has plenty to do to get @entity3 fans back onside and @entity4 believes the former @entity86 and @entity87 boss should not shoulder the burden on his own			2
helping hand : @entity4 says @entity74 should not carry @entity3 's burden alone ' we went through the last qualifying campaign unbeaten , we topped the group , i think we were one of the highest goalscorers across the qualification campaign , ' @entity4 added			1
' obviously we are disappointed with the @entity77 , there ’s no getting away from that , but @entity74 has a contract to 2016 and it ’s his job now , and with our support , to take us forward			0
' the challenge is with us as a collective , not just with @entity74			0
' support : @entity4 has worked with @entity74 since he started his job at the @entity5 pressure : while it looks like @entity3 have a good route to the @entity107 needs to improve his side			1
