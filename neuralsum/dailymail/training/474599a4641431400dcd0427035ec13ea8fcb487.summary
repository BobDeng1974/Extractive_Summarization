by @entity0 researchers have warned that young women are becoming increasingly rare in rural communities in @entity5 's @entity4			1
they say many rural communities hard hit by decades of population declines , young men increasingly outnumber young women			1
the study of @entity13 and @entity14 census data shows in places with 800 or fewer residents , the proportion of young men increased by an average of nearly 40 percent as people went from their teens to their 20s			1
researchers say many rural communities do n't often provide the same opportunity to women - who never return after going to college researchers used the 2000 census to calculate the ratio of boys to girls aged 12 to 17 in more than 2,200 @entity14 and @entity13 cities , towns and townships			1
they then compared that figure to the ratio of men to women aged 22 to 27 in the 2010 census			2
they chose those age ranges to establish a roughly high - school - aged population cohort in 2000 and to take a second look at it in 2010 -- a time span allowing for completion of college and establishing a household			0
those findings suggest leaders should consider the needs of young women in economic and community development plans , said @entity53 , a @entity54 doctoral candidate who conducted the peer - reviewed research			2
his study results were published in april 's @entity58 journal			0
' the whole point of this study was to look at it quantitatively , to see if the numbers bear out this story of younger people leaving and not coming back , ' he said			0
my study was important in helping to substantiate that this is a problem associated with gender			0
' examining census data from 2000 and 2010 , @entity53 found that more than half of 1,627 villages , rural townships , precincts and other locales with 800 or fewer people experienced an increased ratio of young men to young women			1
the median increase was just under 7 percent , but many of the smallest communities saw extreme increases -- in excess of 200 percent -- in the proportion of males to females			2
' the big implication here is that if these ratios do n't trend back toward equilibrium , there is some concern about the long - term population stability of those areas , ' @entity87 said			0
he wanted to learn whether young women were staying in rural areas or returning home after college at the same rates as young men			1
' there is a lot of awareness that younger people are leaving rural communities , ' @entity53 said			1
' where some of the men can come back , because there are a lot of traditionally male jobs like agriculture and industry to return to , many rural communities do n't often provide the same opportunity to women			1
' as long as that imbalance is there , it 's going to limit the development or growth of that age group			0
' the study of @entity13 and @entity14 census data shows in places with 800 or fewer residents , the proportion of young men increased by an average of nearly 40 percent as people went from their teens to their 20s			1
he found no previous research that evaluated migration patterns of his target group , young adults who would be starting families			0
@entity53 found a growing proportion of young women in urban areas during the post-college years			2
major cities and suburbs , including @entity142 and @entity143 , @entity13 , had nearly equal ratios of males and females in the 22 - to - 27 age group			0
in several others , including @entity150 , @entity13 , and @entity151 , women outnumbered men in their age group			2
college may be a significant reason why many young women leave rural communities , @entity53 said			1
as of 2000 , women comprised 56 percent of 25 - to 29 - year - olds with at least four years of higher education			0
social and economic reasons often prevent college graduates from returning home -- they may have formed bonds with new people or the rural job market may be unfavorable			2
in previous studies exploring women 's attitudes toward the rural @entity4 , some women reported limited job opportunities , while others described a patriarchal culture in some rural communities			1
in some communities , young men left in greater numbers than young women -- but the ratio of males to females still increased			1
that 's because the number of women in that community already was small			0
@entity186 in @entity187 , @entity13 , for example , lost 11 of 19 males and 9 of 11 females from 2000 to 2010			0
its ratio of males to females in the cohort changed from less than two men for every woman to four men for every woman .			0

in rural communities young men increasingly outnumber young women
proportion of young men increased by an average of nearly 40 percent as people went from their teens to their 20s
team studied @entity13 and @entity14 census data as believe women do not return after college *due* to a lack of opportunities
