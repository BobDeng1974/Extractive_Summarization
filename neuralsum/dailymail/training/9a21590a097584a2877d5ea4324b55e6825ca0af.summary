by @entity0 published : 07:55 est , 22 march 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 23 march 2013 if there was a badge for being effortlessly stylish , surely the @entity1 would have earned it yesterday			1
with her 60s tweed cap at a jaunty angle and a red , white and blue @entity8 neckerchief , @entity1 even made a snowy camp in @entity10 look chic			1
and her verdict on the result ? ' oh , it 's actually not bad , if you were really desperately hungry , ' she laughed			2
@entity25 became a volunteer with her local @entity53 pack in @entity54 , @entity55 , last year			1
she has some experience to call upon , enrolling at eight as a @entity57 in the 1st @entity59 's pack in @entity60 , @entity61			0
yesterday she joined other adult volunteers as they trained to work with @entity63 and @entity53 at @entity42 , @entity10			1
@entity64 of the @entity36 said the organisation needs adult volunteers			1
he said : ' the reason we value the @entity71 's support so much is that she helps out when she can			1
we want to say to people : “ you can come when you can and we will work around you ”			0
' one of the pack : @entity1 in the @entity57 in september 1990 ( right ) getting stuck in : @entity25 plunged her hands into a doughy mixture of flour , water and sugar as she learned how to make a campfire treat for children success : the group managed to get a fire going despite the falling snow ' it 's quite sugary ' : @entity1 was n't convinced her cooking skills were up to scratch the five month pregnant @entity1 was undeterred by the conditions , plunging her hands into a doughy mixture of flour , water and sugar as she learned how to make ' dampers ' or ' twists ' - a campfire treat for children			1
there were cheers and claps as the instructor , despite the wind and snow , managed to create a flame			0
@entity1 , still wearing her sparkling wedding and engagement rings , then delved her hands into a squidgy mixture of flour , water , oil and sugar			1
she kneaded the dough in a bowl for several minutes before they made elongated twists out of the pastry by rubbing blobs of the mixture between their hands			0
after washing the dough mix off her hands @entity1 wrapped a twist of the messy mixture around a twig stripped of bark which was placed over the open fire ready to toast			1
the show must go on : @entity1 did n't let the snow stop her visit although she did arrive via train rather than helicopter thanks to the conditions be prepared : @entity1 learnt the @entity8 continue with their activities whatever the weather the volunteers ' efforts had mixed results , with the @entity1 laughing and giggling with the others as some of the twisters dropped into the flames			1
' i 'm not sure if these are going to look particularly edible , ' @entity1 laughed			2
after several minutes toasting on the fire @entity1 pulled off a piece of the bread and , rather gingerly , popped it in her mouth			2
' oh , its actually not bad , ' she told the group			0
' it is quite sugary though			0
' @entity150 , 38 , who helped the @entity71 make ' twists ' to toast on the fire said : ' it was great fun , she 's lovely			0
you can tell she enjoys it and got stuck in , she was straight in there			0
she was just treated as one of us , scouting does that , it 's an amazing atmosphere			2
' ms @entity150 , from the @entity163 and @entity162 in @entity164 , added : ' she said , ' maybe see you again in another scouting field '			0
she chuckled that it could not have been much colder			0
it shows you can do scouting in all weather			0
not an awful lot can put us off			0
' down with the kids : after lunch , the @entity71 met children from @entity36 and @entity53 groups who tried some tree climbing passing on her skills : @entity1 showed the children how to safely light a fire after lunch with the volunteers it was time for the @entity1 to teach her new - found skills to a group of children - as the snow got even thicker			1
the adults were joined by around 30 youngsters , aged between eight and ten and from the @entity187 in @entity193 and other scouts and cubs from groups in @entity197 and @entity198 in @entity10			1
@entity1 knelt in the snow to show them how to make fire from sparks using flints and cotton wool , cheering along after one youngster - after several attempts , managed to create a flame			2
later she viewed children practising climbing with ropes			0
@entity25 watched as @entity210 , aged eight , from the 465th @entity211 , struggled to climb up a tree			2
suitable attire : five months pregnant @entity1 wore a khaki jacket with her trusty £ 300 @entity13 wellington boots and favourite blue £ 29.99 @entity218 jeans keeping the snow off her famously bouncy locks : her bakerboy style tweed hat is £ 49 from really wild clothing ' i bet it feels a lot higher up there , ' @entity1 said , before the youngster , 20 feet up , shouted down , ' i ca n't do it ! ' the child was winched down and received a hug from the royal visitor for her efforts			2
@entity234 and @entity235 , both aged nine and from a scout group in @entity237 , @entity193 , both learned about making fire with flint from the @entity1			1
@entity235 said : ' she showed us how to do it			0
it was hard because the snow was putting the sparks out			0
she seemed like a princess , she looked pretty and had lovely hair			0
' @entity235 who gave the @entity1 a brown teddy bear for her new baby added : ' me and my friend got her a gift for her baby			2
she said it 's really cute			0
we did n't do it pink or blue because they said it might be a girl or a boy			0
' delightful company : the other volunteers said @entity1 was ' lovely ' and was treated just like everyone else @entity25 was originally scheduled to come up to @entity10 by helicopter until the weather forecast was looked at , according to palace officials			1
instead she came by train from @entity269 this morning , arriving at nearby @entity270 around midday			0
@entity1 , said to be ' passionate ' about volunteering , helps out occasionally at a scout group close to her home in @entity55			1
the @entity36 is hoping the visit by one of the country 's most high - profile figures will encourage other young adults to get involved in scouting			1
more adult volunteers are needed for the 35,000 young people currently waiting to join the movement , which already has well over half a million members			1
@entity64 , assistant director of @entity36 , said : ' @entity25 works with eight to 10 - year - olds , she 's learned how to do stuff when she goes to cubs on wednesday evenings			1
' @entity287 is the @entity288 , last year when the @entity1 committed to her charity work she did n't want to be just a figurehead , she wanted to do something meaningful			2
she 's passionate about volunteering			0
' the reason we value the @entity71 ' support is that even though she 's very busy she helps out when she can			2
' sunday : @entity25 joined husband @entity295 at a @entity296 at @entity297 in @entity298 , and laughed off getting her heel stuck in a grate , right tuesday : the royal couple visited children 's charity @entity302 , in @entity304 , @entity305 wednesday : @entity25 joined the @entity287 on a tour of @entity308 underground station to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the @entity310 and delighted in being given a ' baby on board ' badge to wear , right friday : @entity1 ended the week in @entity10 where she braved the snow to join scout volunteers			1
