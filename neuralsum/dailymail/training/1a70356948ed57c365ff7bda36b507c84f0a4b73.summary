published : 16:02 est , 12 october 2013 updated : 16:02 est , 12 october 2013 ' no place in politics today ' : @entity2 , pictured , has been attacked after paying tribute to @entity4 in articles ‘ @entity11 ’ @entity6 is keen to play down suggestions that @entity9 has ‘ lurched to the @entity8 ’ under his leadership			1
but the message does n’t seem to have reached leafy @entity13 , where the party has just selected an apologist for @entity4 as its candidate for the next general election			1
at first glance , @entity2 would appear to be a good fit with the affluent @entity22 seat , held by @entity24 @entity23			2
educated at a private school and @entity27 , mr @entity2 ’s cv bears the hallmarks of a modern @entity9 politician			1
however , a delve into some of his recent writings suggests the union official is determined to keep the @entity35 flying over the @entity36			2
he has called the @entity37 ‘ a great success ’ and praised the ‘ significant improvement in working class living standards ’ during @entity40			0
he described the attacks on @entity43 as the ‘ opening salvo in a war between two rival imperialisms ’ – equating @entity47 with wartime @entity48 under @entity49 – and branded the @entity50 a ‘ figurehead for slavery ’			0
in the run - up to his selection last month , the telecoms engineer set out some of his uncompromising beliefs in articles in ultra-left - wing publications			1
paying tribute to @entity4 ’s character , whose brutal dictatorship led to the deaths of millions of citizens , he wrote earlier this year : ‘ we should recognise how @entity4 was the creature of his times ; and not alone in culpability			0
‘ what is more , the character of @entity4 , who almost through a feat of sheer will industrialised and militarised the @entity72 to defend itself against the @entity74 threat , was also the character that ruthlessly regarded people as expendable			0
it did give @entity4 the attributes needed to be a great war leader ’			0
and in 2009 , mr @entity2 , who is the local branch secretary of the @entity81 union , used a piece in @entity83 to put a positive gloss on the tyrant ’s rule			2
' shocking : ' mr @entity2 wrote of the rule of @entity4 , right , in glowing terms describing him in apparently respectful terms as ‘ the @entity4 ’ , he wrote : ‘ free market capitalism had seen worldwide depression in the 1930s and had led to fascism and war			1
' meanwhile the @entity72 ’s economy had achieved staggering success in the same period , including a significant improvement in working class living standards , despite the @entity4 ’s terror ’			0
in the same article , he wrote warmly of the @entity37 : ‘ if we set to one side the issue of personal liberty , the [ @entity37 ] wall was a great success			0
’ ' @entity11 ' @entity6 : mr @entity6 , pictured , has played down his party 's ' lurch to the @entity8 ' - but the message does not seem to have reached mr @entity2 in other writings he has described modern @entity111 as a ‘ marriage ’ between @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 which is ‘ based on shared guilt ’ , with the ‘ bloodstains of the @entity118 soaked equally into the souls of the @entity113 , @entity114 and @entity115 ’			1
he has also opposed @entity121 resistance to the socialist @entity123 ‘ hegemonic state sector ’ , dismissing the @entity50 as a ‘ feudal figurehead ’ of the ‘ slavery and barbarism ’ in @entity128 ’s past			0
last night , @entity130 chairman @entity129 said mr @entity2 ’s ‘ grossly offensive beliefs will shock ordinary people up and down the country ’ and called for his deselection			1
he added : ‘ suggestions that the @entity37 was a good thing and @entity4 was a great leader have no place in politics today – the @entity9 must act immediately and sack this throwback			1
’ a @entity9 spokesman said : ‘ this is a desperate smear attempt by the @entity142			0
@entity9 are concentrating on addressing the cost - of - living crisis			2

@entity9 is keen to *downplay* suggestions it is getting more left - wing
but the party selected @entity2 as candidate for @entity13 in 2015
the trade union official has written of @entity4 's rule in glowing terms
he also attacked the @entity50 in ultra-left - wing publications
@entity130 chairman @entity129 has called for his deselection
