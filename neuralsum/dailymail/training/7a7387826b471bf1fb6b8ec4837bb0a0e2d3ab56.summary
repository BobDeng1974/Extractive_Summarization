by @entity0 and @entity1 last updated at 1:39 am on 23rd november 2011 a village vicar who says he was forced out of his job has been told he can not claim unfair dismissal because he is ‘ employed by @entity5			1
’ reverend @entity6 claims he had no option but to resign after a campaign of abuse by parishioners he likened to characters out of the @entity13			1
the 44 - year - old reverend accused the church of failing to support him in the remote country parish in @entity17 , near @entity18			1
religious views : rev @entity6 as vicar in @entity21 , left , and today as he attempted to sue @entity5 at an employment tribunal @entity23 , which is in the parish at the centre of the row after his resignation , he compared his treatment at the hands of parishioners with the television show in which a remote community is fearful of outsiders			1
@entity34 said : ‘ this is a local parish for local people - that is the @entity38 i arrived here , i held a lunch for the church wardens of all six churches			1
‘ at the end of the lunch , one of the wardens , @entity47 , boasted that they did n’t get on with the previous rector so they “ chewed him up and spat him out ”			1
’ mrs @entity47 denies that she made this comment			1
his claim of constructive dismissal was being supported by @entity55 , the union			1
but lawyers for the @entity57 pointed to ecclesiastical laws which state that clergy are not employees but office holders ‘ employed by @entity5			1
’ they say vicars are therefore not eligible to claim unfair dismissal , because @entity5 can not be sued			1
after moving to the parish in 2005 , @entity34 said he was subjected to constant harassment and even threats			2
the locals were so hostile to the new vicar that he installed cctv cameras to protect his family			2
@entity34 says his dog was poisoned , animal excrement was smeared on his car , his tyres were slashed , his home phone lines were cut and his heating oil was stolen			1
' forced out ' : reverend @entity6 with wife @entity78 and children @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82 at the @entity84 rectory where life was so miserable for them ' murdered ' : @entity34 said his dog @entity87 was poisoned during the ' campaign of intimidation ' one church warden even objected to @entity34 ’s beard , warning him that locals wanted a ‘ clean shaven clergyman ’ , @entity91 ’s @entity90 heard			1
@entity34 claims he asked bishops to help him , but they ‘ washed their hands ’ of the case			1
he eventually left in september 2009 after developing stress - related ill - health			2
@entity34 told an employment hearing that he had written to bishops begging them to intervene , but they refused to help him			2
‘ what confused and upset and distressed me was that i was told : “ we are not dealing with it			2
@entity108 shut , end of , ” ’ he said			2
‘ i was told that i could n’t access a grievance procedure , that i did n’t have any rights			2
’ instead , he said , a series of replacement vicars were ‘ parachuted in ’ , one of whom was ‘ preparing secret reports to the bishop ’ about him , including comments he had made in ‘ confidential meetings			2
’ in december 2009 , the @entity6 ’s wife and three youngest children left the dilapidated four - bedroom rectory after the @entity57 launched eviction proceedings against them			1
their eldest child was away at university			0
taking on the lord : @entity34 's lawsuit is reminiscent of the @entity130 film @entity131 who sued @entity5 at the time , the @entity133 , who was ordained in 2001 , said : ‘ my career has been ruined , my health and that of my wife and children has been shattered , and my family has suffered terribly from all the strain			1
’ @entity133 said the @entity141 had ‘ glossed over ’ the serious problems in the parish , which is made up of six churches in local hamlets and villages , when he agreed to move his family there			0
‘ when we came here , i was told by the church that they were looking for stability , as the last vicar had left after 18 months for health reasons			0
if most employees resign from their job because of an employer ’s behaviour , it may be considered to be constructive dismissal			0
they would need to show that : ‘ i found a situation that was allowed to fester for decades , where of the four local parishes only three were legally constituted because two had refused to merge ‘ this dated back to 1979 and i was staggered that it had not been sorted out already			0
‘ when i tackled it , it sparked a wave of resentment from the community which has culminated in my family and i living in a climate of fear in a supposedly rural idyll			0
‘ there have been too many incidences of harassment over the last four years for them to be the odd coincidence			0
’ describing the beard incident to the tribunal yesterday , mr @entity34 said : ‘ it was a church warden who complained about it			0
‘ i said i had grown a beard because i had a skin infection			0
’ when asked if the warden had then retracted their objection to the beard , mr @entity34 replied : ‘ if only it had been that simple			0
’ @entity34 has not worked as a vicar since leaving the parish , and has been diagnosed with @entity190 , the chronic fatigue illness			0
his wife , an environmental health officer , said : ‘ i feel like four precious years of family life have been robbed from us			0
‘ it has been the worst time of my life			0
i used to be a committed @entity197 , now i am agnostic			0
‘ if this is @entity197 in action i do n’t want anything to do with it			0
’ unite officer @entity201 said : ‘ the fact that @entity6 and his family have been forced to leave their home during the so - called season of goodwill at the pinnacle of the @entity197 year is a disgrace , and a dark stain on the church ’s reputation			1
‘ this is a toxic parish with a 40 - year history of clergy leaving abruptly or in broken health			0

rev @entity6 claims his dog was poisoned , excrement was smeared on his car , his car tyres were slashed and his phone line cut
he said parishioners boasted they ' chewed up and spat out ' the previous rector
@entity6 , 44 , has been *dubbed* ' the man who sued @entity5 '
