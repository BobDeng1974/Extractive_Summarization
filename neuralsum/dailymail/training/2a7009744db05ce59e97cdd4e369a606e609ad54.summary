by @entity0 published : 06:25 est , 4 october 2013 updated : 15:49 est , 4 october 2013 when @entity1 and @entity2 were rescued from a battery farm things started to look up			1
no longer stuck in cramped cages , they were suddenly free to roam around the garden to their hearts ’ content			0
but it seems their new - found freedom was n’t all it was cracked up to be			0
the chickens were n’t used to being outside and found it a bit chilly for their liking			0
@entity18 and warm : ex-battery chickens @entity1 , left and @entity2 , right , show off their cosy fleece - lined jackets wrapping up : the pair had jackets made after their owners were told ex-battery hens often struggle in the cold so their owners , @entity27 and @entity28 , put their heads together and came up with a solution – two chicken - sized fleeces			1
the couple from @entity33 took the pair to a tailor ’s shop where the birds had their inside drumsticks and chicken breasts measured for two fleece jackets			1
the garments slip over the hens ’ heads and cover their crowns , although there is enough room for them to flap their wings			0
custom - made : @entity27 and @entity28 took the pair to a tailors , where they were measured stay still ! @entity51 the chicken is measured for her jacket by manageress of the @entity55 tailors , @entity56 one of the jackets is lined with leopard print and has a wishbone design on the front andthe other has a red trim and a heart logo on			1
the 18 - month - old @entity65 hens will wear the coats throughout the winter until they are more used to the chilly temperatures			2
@entity27 , 47 , a taxi driver from @entity33 , said : ' we rescued the chickens from a battery hen place and this is their first winter out of the environment they ’re used to			1
good fit : the chicken 's breasts and inner drumsticks were measured by staff ' battery hens do n’t see day light and they are n’t used to the cold weather or changes			2
' someone explained to us that they might suffer from the cold in their first season , so we looked on the internet for a way around this			0
' we took @entity1 and @entity2 to a local tailors and they have fitted them with these two lovely jackets			1
creation : the jackets , pictured completed above , were then made from a drawn pattern , pictured behind ' our family and friends think that it ’s brilliant we managed to find somewhere who would happily measure and fit coats for two chickens			2
' a spokeswoman from the @entity55 , the tailors behind the quirky jackets , said : ' we were very surprised to have an enquiry about a pair of chickens			1
' we have never worked with animals before and it was the weirdest request we have received but we were happy to help			0
' they were our most bizarre customers but they very well behaved			0
happy customers : @entity1 poses in her jacket with owner @entity116			0

@entity1 and @entity2 rescued by @entity27 and @entity28
couple from @entity33 were told ex-battery hens often struggle to adapt to the cold in the winter months
so owners took pair to @entity55 tailors , who made the fleece - lined jackets after measuring under their drumsticks and across their chests
the chickens wear their jackets while in the back garden
