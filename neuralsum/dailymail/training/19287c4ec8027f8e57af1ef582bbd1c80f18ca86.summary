the tiny spider that builds elaborate sculptures of itself from dead insects , debris and leaves has been caught on film			1
the artful arthropod was spotted in @entity8 in 2012 and is said to craft these decoys in a bid to fool predators and avoid being eaten			1
the spider is believed to be a new species of @entity14 - a genus which includes other sculpting arachnids , but none of which of which have been observed to build replicas with multiple , spidery legs			2
during one shot , @entity29 user @entity27 shows the spider decoy , and an image of the creature side - by - side , pictured , to show just how alike the fake is to the original biologist and science teacher @entity36 discovered the apparently novel spider in september 2012 as he led tourists in a floodplain surrounding @entity8 's @entity40			1
' from afar , it appears to be a medium sized spider about an inch across , possibly dead and dried out , hanging in the center of a spider web along the side of the trail , ' he wrote in a blog post at the time for eco-tourism firm @entity49			1
in the new video , released by @entity29 user @entity52 , the spider and its decoy is caught on camera during an expedition to the same region of southeastern @entity8			1
during one shot , @entity52 placed an image of the spider decoy with the image of the creature side - by - side to show just how alike the fake is to the original			2
the spider and its decoy , pictured , was caught on camera during an expedition to the @entity68 in @entity8			2
it is said to be a new species of @entity71 , a genus which includes other sculpting arachnids but none of which of which have been observed to build replicas with multiple , spidery legs during another , the spider decoy glows in the light from the camera , which also acts to highlight its long , spindly legs			2
following the initial discovery , @entity36 contacted @entity85 , an arachnologist at @entity86 , who agreed it was an unusual find			0
she told @entity88 it was likely to be an unidentified species			0
even among the decoy - building species of @entity14 , she said , decoys with legs and the web - shaking behaviour have not been observed before			1
after speaking with experts , @entity36 returned to the trails around @entity96 and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the same floodplain			0
the spider ( pictured left in close up ) was first spotted in 2012 in @entity8 , and was later found separately in the @entity102 by entomologist @entity103			0
biologists are curious as to how two similar creatures , so far apart , have both managed to evolve this defence mechanism biologist and science teacher @entity36 discovered the spider in september 2012 as he led tourists in a floodplain around @entity96 in the @entity113			1
after speaking with experts , @entity36 returned to the trails around @entity96 and found a further 25 specimens of the novel spider in the same floodplain @entity117 , an entomologist at the @entity118 who studies web - building , said he had never before seen a structure like the ones found in the @entity122			1
@entity14 are known for decoy building , but most of their constructions are clumpy rather than something which resembles and actual spider			0
' @entity14 do n’t have that spider - with - leg looking thing , which is why we think it ’s a new species , ' @entity36 said			0
he hopes to return to the area in january with a permit to collect samples , in preparation for submitting a study and getting the new species officially recognised			0
the spider was also found separately in the @entity102 by entomologist @entity103 in march 2012			0

spider species was discovered in the @entity113 @entity122 in 2012
it builds decoy spiders and hangs them in its web to fool predators
these elaborate decoys are made from dead insects , debris and leaves
this unusual behaviour has now been caught on film in an amazing video
