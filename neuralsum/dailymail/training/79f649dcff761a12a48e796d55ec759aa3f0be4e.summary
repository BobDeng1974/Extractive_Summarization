a web site that claims to be able to accurately predict your age from a few mouse clicks has been launched by @entity5 researchers			1
@entity7 experts produced the online experiment to examine how our motor controls change as we age			1
as users click on a series of dot patterns with their mouse or trackpad , the experiment monitors their reaction time and speed of movement , and even how they move the mouse from one area of the screen to another			0
a grab of the test can be seen below in the first image			1
the second image is the interactive test itself			1
please note that the interactive test may take a few moments to load due to high demand			1
participants are asked to click on approximately 50 targets of various sizes			0
as users click on a series of dot patterns with their mouse or trackpad , the experiment monitors their reaction time and speed of movement			0
it also analyses the tiny pauses between movements , and what shapes the cursor is moved in - all of which the team believe may change as we get older			1
this information is then compared against the results of users from around the world to predict a participant 's age			1
the project was created as part of the @entity58 project at @entity7			1
' to guess your age , we look at over 60 factors , ' the team say			2
it is one of several experiments designed to turn internet users into ' lab rats ' ' speed definitely matters , but it is only one thing that our software looks at			0
' other factors include the duration of tiny pauses people make while moving the mouse pointer , the timing of the peak velocity , the shape of the movement , and many others			0
' the site is part of a suite of online experiments			1
' the site is designed to bring research out of the lab into your living room , study , work place , or wherever else you are using computers , ' the team behind it says			2
researchers say simply analysing the speed at which people click in an online test can accurately estimate their age simple : participants are presented with a series of dots in changing sizes and patterns , and must click on the red dot in order to proceed to the next stage by @entity109 i am 27 - years - old - or so says @entity7 's online age predictor			1
in reality , sadly i am 30 , but three years off the mark is n't bad for an estimate based on a few clicks of a mouse and some basic questions			0
taking the test could not be simpler ; participants are presented with a series of changing patterns comprised of a series of grey dots and one red one , and must click on the red dot in order to proceed to the next stage			2
altogether , users click on around 50 dots during the test			2
i shot through the first 10 or 20 clicks at top speed , ignoring the intermittent message informing me i could take a short break in a bid to achieve the most flattering result possible			0
but as the test went on i noticed myself slowing down , inadvertently clicking on white space instead of the red dot in my haste to hit the target			2
after a shaky finish , my eventual estimate of 27 was better than i had anticipated			0
' we are trying to understand how human motor performance changes with age , ' the researchers say			1
' we believe that research should be done in collaboration with people â€” with people like you who are interested in learning about themselves and helping research			0
' the team also hope the results will show in there are differences in performance around the world			2
participants are asked to click on approximately 50 targets of various sizes , and also also asks a few basic questions about users and their computer use			0
at the end of each experiment , you will see a page with your personalized feedback , which lets you compare yourself and your performance to people of other countries			2
' by participating , you contribute to research on people 's similarities and differences around the world when interacting with technology , and more than 100,000 people have participated in experiments on the site			2
' by building up a database of results from around the world , the researcher hope to find out whether different cultures are more adept to this type of test , and whether cultures that use computers more regularly age in different ways			1
the team has also developed several other online tests			1
in one , entitled ' are you more @entity5 or more @entity196 ? ' , participants learn whether you they are more sensitive to a focal object ( as most @entity5 ) or more attuned to the context ( as many @entity196 )			0
a second tests emotional intelligence , by asking people to read emotions of others just by looking at their eyes			0
the final test is designed to find out how different cultures view websites , and find out if colorful websites are more eastern or more @entity208 asks people to give their views of different types of site , ranging from dull to extremely colourful			1
' many people have asked me why @entity58 is mainly about exploring how we are different and similar in our cultural preferences , ' say the lead researcher , known on the site as labrat			0
' i guess one of the reasons is that i have always liked to travel and see how people around the world differ from each other			0
' what i find fascinating , and what my research has shown , is that these differences also translate to the online world			0
