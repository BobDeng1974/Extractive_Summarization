by @entity0 published : 17:34 est , 30 august 2012 updated : 03:35 est , 31 august 2012 after shooting to fame on @entity3 , it 's fair to say @entity4 knows how to manipulate men to get her own way			1
but now her flirtatious behaviour has landed her in hot water in the @entity10 house yet again as she faces eviction for a second time			1
the 24 - year - old beauty was slammed by love rat @entity14 , incredibly without a hint of irony , for causing a ' love triangle ' between former pals @entity19 and prince @entity21			1
emotional : @entity4 burst into tears as she confronted @entity19 about nominating her for a second time and she was forced to listen to every word of their criticism as @entity10 ordered the group to make their nominations in front of each other yet again			1

@entity4 led @entity21 to the point where i thought he was going to propose			2
she knows what she 's doing and she 's very good at it			0
' but worse was yet to come when @entity4 's fellow housemates slammed her behaviour in front of her			1
and not one to shy from flinging the insults @entity14 said : ' i 'm sick of this love triangle situation , and i think she was one of the main causes of @entity62 becoming distant when they used to be friends			1
' cheater : @entity66 and the rapper ( left ) wed in 2005 but their marriage collapsed when it was revealed he had been unfaithful with singer @entity72 ( right ) perhaps he was speaking from experience as the so solid rapper is well - known for cheating on his wife , tv 's sweetheart @entity66 , with singer @entity72 - subsequently breaking up his marriage after creating his own love triangle			1

although i do care about her , let 's see how the public feels			0
' upsetting : the housemates were forced to make their nominations in front of each other yet again meanwhile , @entity93 added : ' we 've got very different views on how you treat and respect men			1

' i would never have done that to you			0
never , ' she said			0
' i thought out of everyone i could rely on you , like i said i could			0
' upset : @entity4 looked on as she was nominated by @entity110 , @entity14 , @entity111 , @entity93 and the situation but the @entity114 star claimed his decision was tactical , saying : ' i practically love you , but i know you have a boyfriend			1
' and @entity4 's actions caused a further divide between the group when prince @entity21 attempted to stand up for her against @entity14			1
however , the rapper immediately hit back in a scathing attack , suggesting the model 's behaviour has been ' disgraceful '			0
' i 'm sick of this love triangle ' : the celebrity big brother housemates fumed that they were fed up of the model 's incessant flirting he fumed : ' she 's got a boyfriend and how she 's acting is wrong			1
she 's flirtatious , she 's sexual with people			0
' do you think going into your shower and flashing your boobs at someone is ok ? she does n't carry herself like someone who has a boyfriend and i honestly think it 's disgraceful			0
' but @entity4 was n't the only one left in tears after the night 's events			2
nominations time : in turn , @entity4 chose to put @entity93 and @entity110 up for eviction @entity147 sobbed in the @entity42 after claiming former @entity149 actress @entity148 was playing a ' vile game '			1
she told @entity10 : ' @entity111 is so f * * * ing two - faced			0
i have felt a b * * * h coming in here s * * * ging that woman off , but she is playing the game in a vile way			0

sobbing : @entity147 was also reduced to tears in the @entity42 after claiming @entity148 was playing a ' vile game ' ' i did n't nominate her because i thought she 's a national treasure and thought everyone would hate me			2
but i do n't care anymore			0
