since september 1996 , @entity0 has ruled the roost at @entity2 , not just building a squad and controlling a team , but shaping a club			1
in almost 19 years in charge of the @entity7 , @entity0 has won three @entity9 titles , lifted five @entity10 , led his team to their only ever @entity13 final and masterminded the move to the @entity15			1
when he does eventually decide to step down , @entity0 ’s legacy will not just be about his successes , but also his longevity			0
@entity0 has been at @entity2 for almost 19 years , while every other team has changed manager @entity0 led the @entity7 to their first @entity22 final , and has won three @entity9 titles the @entity2 boss has been in north @entity24 since september 1996 , surviving 156 @entity9 bosses in an era where @entity9 chairmen are as forgiving to their managers as @entity29 tends to be towards referees , @entity0 is approaching two decades in the job – almost 15 years longer than the next longest - serving manager in the division			1
in fact , since the @entity35 arrived in north @entity24 , there have been 156 changes in management at the other clubs in the division			0
here @entity41 looks at the men @entity0 has survived … what counts as a change ? with caretaker managers , interim appointments , and even the odd case of two men doing the job at the same time , it can be difficult to tell when exactly a club have officially changed managers			1
counting caretaker managers would mean , technically , that @entity54 had been appointed @entity56 manager three times in five years			0
there were times when it seemed @entity54 just had to wait a few minutes to be caretaker at @entity56 again @entity62 had already left two @entity9 clubs before @entity0 had been in the job three years @entity65 ( left ) replacing @entity66 was the second change after @entity0 arrived so while ‘ interim ’ managers are included in our total , caretakers are not included unless they were given the job for a fixed term			1
added to that , for those few occasions when two men have been in charge at the same time , they are counted as only one sacking unless , as with the case of @entity81 when he worked alongside @entity82 at @entity83 , one is sacked before the other			0
landmarks that all means that @entity86 ’s sacking this month is the 156th managerial change since @entity0 took over			0
@entity89 ’s resignation at @entity90 , less than a month after ‘ the professor ’ got his feet under the desk at @entity2 , was the first , with five more coming in the 1996 - 97 season			1
@entity89 ( left ) was the first manager to go after @entity0 was appointed , while @entity86 is the most recent @entity96 ’s dismissal from @entity97 in november 2003 marked the 50th reign @entity0 had survived , while @entity100 ’s decision to leave @entity101 for @entity102 brought up the century in the summer of 2009			0
@entity104 ’ shock resignation from @entity105 on the eve of this season was the 150th time a manager had left their job in the @entity0 era			2
@entity96 , sacked by @entity97 in 2003 , marked the 50th @entity9 manager to go in the @entity0 era when @entity100 left @entity101 for @entity102 it marked the 100th managerial change since @entity0 arrived unsurprisingly the rate of change has dramatically increased in recent years			1
the first half of @entity0 ’s tenure at @entity2 produced just 63 sackings in a little over nine years			1
in the same time since then , there have been 93 changes , at a rate of around 10 a season			0
last season ’s total of 14 managerial changes was , in fact , the largest number in @entity9 history			1
in contrast the 2002 - 03 season saw the fewest changes since @entity0 ’s arrival , with only five managers leaving their posts			2
@entity104 ' resignation from @entity105 last summer was change no 150 since @entity0 started method of change ? the vast majority of the time , when a @entity9 manager leaves his job , it ’s because he ’s been told to clear out his desk			1
a lucky few get to set their own date , as @entity0 surely will in the coming years , but most are pushed before they can jump			0
remarkably , in the last 18 - and - a - bit years since @entity0 joined @entity2 , only 18 managers left by choice to go straight into another job ( and three of those went to international management rather than another club ) , while some resigned and a handful retired			1
@entity155 is one of only two @entity9 managers in the past two decades to leave for @entity157 @entity158 also left a @entity9 club to take the biggest job in @entity162 football three times a manager stepped down for health reasons , although two of those were @entity168 , while one manager , @entity169 , was placed on gardening leave in january 2000			2
@entity66 ( @entity171 ) and @entity172 ( @entity105 ) share the honour of being the two managers in since 1996 to have been removed from their job only to move upwards to director of football , something that may well happen to @entity0 when he decides to end his term in management			2
which clubs change the most ? we all have a good idea who we consider to be the most trigger - happy owners , or the least stable clubs , and it should therefore come as no surprise which two clubs top the list of managerial changes			0
@entity190 and @entity191 have each replaced 11 men since @entity0 walked into @entity193			0
at @entity195 there were only two sackings – @entity62 and @entity197 – between the arrivals of @entity0 and @entity199 , but the revolving door has turned nine times since the @entity202 arrived			0
@entity204 ( left ) and @entity205 have both managed one of the league 's most prolific clubs @entity29 's return for his second spell at @entity190 was the club 's 12th appointment since @entity0 started since @entity199 took over at @entity190 the club have had nine managers , @entity215 twice , in 12 years @entity216 - 2 @entity217 - 4 @entity83 - 6 @entity218 - 7 @entity56 - 10 @entity190 - 11 @entity219 has at least brought success for @entity190 , but the same can not be said at @entity221 , where @entity222 is the 12th man to try and pick up a trophy since @entity2 last appointed a manager			1
the @entity7 ’ north @entity24 rivals @entity56 are just behind @entity190 and @entity191 , having replaced 10 managers since their neighbours went for @entity0			2
@entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity204 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 and @entity236 have all left since @entity0 arrived			0
@entity229 ( left ) and @entity232 are two of the 10 @entity56 managers who have been replaced @entity236 ( right ) became the 10th @entity56 manager to do battle with @entity0 last season perhaps most impressive in their high number of changes though , are @entity244 and @entity102 , who have managed nine @entity9 managerial replacements each , despite spending a fair amount of time outside the top flight since 1996			1
saints have had seven @entity0 years below the @entity9 – including two in @entity252 – while @entity102 have had five			2
of the top flight ’s ever - presents , @entity216 have unsurprisingly had the fewest changes , with just sir @entity256 ’s retirement and @entity257 ’ sacking , while @entity83 have said goodbye to six bosses during @entity0 ’s tenure			1
sir @entity256 ( right ) and @entity0 locked horns repeatedly until the former 's retirement in 2013 who has managed the most clubs ? it is not just clubs that can get restless			0
while @entity0 has been happy to stick in one job since @entity272 ’s breakfast at @entity273 was top of the charts , other managers prefer to move around			2
@entity157 manager @entity155 has left four @entity9 clubs – @entity90 , @entity277 , @entity83 and @entity278 – in the last 18 years			0
@entity234 has left five @entity9 jobs in the time @entity0 has been in his only one @entity234 won the @entity280 in one of his two spells at @entity283 , which ended in october 2008 @entity285 boss @entity284 is on his fifth @entity9 job since @entity0 arrived in @entity24 @entity285 ’s @entity284 has matched that , his terms at @entity90 , @entity277 , @entity288 and @entity289 all coming to an end while @entity0 stayed put			1
but neither of them can match @entity234 , who has left five jobs , at four clubs , since the @entity2 boss took charge of his side			0
@entity234 most recently resigned as @entity289 manager , but has also been in charge at @entity56 , @entity300 and had two spells at @entity283 in the top flight .			0

@entity0 has been in charge at @entity2 since september 1996
in that time every other top - flight club has changed managers at least twice
@entity0 has outlasted more than 150 @entity9 changes
