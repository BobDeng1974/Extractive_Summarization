a mother - of - two who lost her eye to skin cancer is warning people against the dangers of wearing cheap sunglasses			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , @entity9 , had her right eye removed three years ago in a life - saving nine - hour operation to stop the cancer spreading to her brain			1
the 46 - year - old teaching assistant believes her cancer developed from getting badly burned on holiday in @entity17 when she was 15 - where she also bought cheap sunglasses without proper uv protection			1
the decision cost me my eye			1
' but i know i ’ve been lucky , because through losing my eye , my life was saved			1
' to celebrate her recovery , @entity23 held an aptly named ‘ @entity43 ’ and named each table after a part of the eye			2
she hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over £ 10,000 for the @entity45 where she was treated			0
@entity23 ’s problems first began when she was 24 and had a cancerous mole removed from her neck			1
she was given the all - clear and put it behind her			2
@entity23 went on to have two children , @entity51 , now 14 , and @entity52 , eight			0
' having one eye does n’t stop me at all and i ’ve learned to be comfortable with the way i look , ' says @entity23 , pictured with her niece but in december 2011 , aged 42 , she began to suffer with blurred vision			2
she was eventually diagnosed with a malignant melanoma behind her right eye			1
@entity23 says : ' my mind immediately went back to a teenage holiday in @entity17 when i had been badly sunburned			1
i had blistered very badly on my neck , which was exactly the same place where i ’d first had skin cancer			1
' i had scrimped on sunglasses too ; i bought cheap ones because they were trendy – but they did n’t protect my eyes at all			1
' i used to buy lots of them every time i went on holiday because they only cost a couple of euros			0
i binned them all as soon as i was diagnosed with cancer			0
she is now cancer free but has to stay out of the sun , and wears a patch over her eye , as she 's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye			2
@entity81 , @entity23 with her doctors ' my consultant confirmed that the sun was definitely the cause and that the holiday was likely the starting point for cancer			2
' i was so angry , so frustrated with myself			0
but it was too late for that			0
' the lump was so big it was forcing the eye up and out of the socket			2
' her eye had to be removed , to stop the cancer spreading to her brain , but her consultant had never done that type of surgery before			1
@entity23 says : ' it was a huge risk and he discussed with experts from around the @entity103 before my operation			0
in the end there were three consultants at my surgery			0
' they drilled in through the back of my head to get to my eye , so it was a horrible experience			2
' in 2012 , @entity23 had nine hours of gruelling surgery followed by months of radiotherapy			0
but a year on , she made a good recovery and returned to work			0
in 2013 , she found a cancerous lump in her leg , which also had to be removed			1
her consultant believes that @entity23 ’s eye and leg tumours were both caused by rogue cells from the original tumour in her neck			1
to celebrate her recovery , @entity23 held an aptly named ‘ @entity43 ’ ( pictured ) and named each table after a part of the eye she hopes to repeat the event annually and has so far raised over £ 10,000 for the @entity45 where she was treated she is now cancer - free but has to stay out of the sun , and wears a patch over her eye , as she 's never felt comfortable with a prosthetic eye			1
speaking about her @entity43 , she says : ' my friend did n’t understand the concept and she told me she did n’t want to sit on " @entity136 ’s table " because she might not like him ! ' @entity23 says : ' having one eye does n’t stop me at all and i ’ve learned to be comfortable with the way i look			0

i just hope my story can save someone else			0
