by @entity0 two men convicted of plotting to murder singer @entity2 , 27 , have had their sentences cut after a legal challenge two men convicted of plotting to rob and kill international pop star @entity2 have had their jail terms cut after winning an appeal against the length of their sentences			1
@entity8 , 33 , had his 18 - year sentence cut to ten years by three @entity11 judges in @entity12 , while @entity13 , 36 , who was originally given life with a minimum term of ten years and eight months , had his minimum reduced to six - and - a - half years			1
as a result , @entity8 , who with @entity17 was found guilty of conspiring to murder the 27 - year - old singer last year , could be free in as little as five years ' time			1
the pair , of @entity21 , @entity22 , were convicted of conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to rob following a three - week trial at @entity27			1
they drove from @entity22 to miss @entity2 ’s home in @entity30 with an arsenal of weapons to rob and kill her			1
when the pair were sentenced , judge @entity33 , the recorder of @entity27 , branded @entity17 a danger to the public , and said he targeted @entity38 to get more than £ 1million from her			0
he told him : ' you intended to rob her and kill her and dump her body in the river , according to your words , and then leave the country with your accomplice , @entity8			2
' you had no reason to target her except that she was a wealthy young woman as she was a successful singer			0
' @entity17 and @entity8 had scouted miss @entity2 ’s home and were on their way to attack her armed with a sword , three knives , two hammers , masks , gloves and a hosepipe when they were arrested in @entity60 in june 2011			1
suspicious residents had called the police , having spotted their badly - damaged @entity63 in the area			0
the pair told police they were lost and were trying to get to @entity67 , but officers became wary and discovered the weapons in the boot			0
giving the ruling of the court , mr @entity71 said @entity17 ’s appealed life sentence still held			2
@entity8 , 33 , left , and @entity13 , 36 , successfully appealed against the length of their jail terms lawyers for the pair had argued that their ' clumsy and badly - planned ' conspiracy was not serious enough to qualify @entity17 for a life sentence			1
but the judges rejected this , saying @entity17 's life sentence ' was justified ' , and that he ' poses a high risk of serious harm to the public '			2
taking into account the 22 months spent in custody before sentencing , @entity17 now becomes eligible to apply for parole in december 2017 , but the judges stressed that ' we are not ordering that the appellant be released in december 2017 '			0
mr @entity71 said : ' far from it			0
the significance of the minimum term is that it specifies that the @entity98 will only be able to consider for the first time in late 2017 whether the appellant can safely be released			0
' @entity101 : this samurai swords was among other weapons found in the boot of a car driven by the men ' the purpose and effect of a sentence of life imprisonment is that if it is never considered safe for the offender to be released , he may remain detained for life , and that if he is ever released it can only be on licence and subject to supervision			2
' @entity8 , who was described as the ' foot soldier ' to @entity17 's ' instigator ' , was ' of exceptionally low intellectual capacity ' , the judge said			2
mr @entity71 said that had @entity8 been more intelligent , ' he would have realised that the chances of a successful and profitable robbery were so remote as not to be worth attempting '			0
the judge said the decision to reduce @entity8 's sentence was taken in the light of @entity17 's reduced sentence			1
a spokesman for @entity38 said the singer declined to comment .			0
