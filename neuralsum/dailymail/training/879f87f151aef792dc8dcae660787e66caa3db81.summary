by @entity0 published : 05:11 est , 9 january 2014 updated : 12:17 est , 10 january 2014 @entity5 ’s populist attacks on immigration risk ‘ destroying the future ’ of the @entity11 people , a senior @entity3 official has claimed in an extraordinary attack on an elected prime minister			1
@entity12 , vice-president of the @entity13 , accused mr @entity5 of fuelling fears of an ' invasion ' and claimed @entity11 claiming ‘ much more ’ in benefits than @entity3 migrants			1
it is the latest broadside from the continent aimed at the prime minister since he complained about child benefit being exported across the @entity3 and urged other @entity22 leaders to curb immigration			1
taking part in an online web chat , miss @entity12 said mr @entity5 was using populist attacks on @entity22 to win votes , to the detriment of the @entity40 people			1
‘ the free movement and supposed invasion by the people who want to take advantage of the social security and health is an invention of politicians who like to have populist movements in order to win in elections , ’ she said			2
‘ i ’m mostly frustrated about the political leaders [ in @entity11 ]			0
what is leadership if you just try with political movements and political speeches to gain votes ? you are destroying the future of your people , actually			0
pressure : the prime minister has vowed to use his planned renegotiation of @entity11 's @entity3 membership to tackle immigration ‘ what the people who come to work bring to the taxation and social security is much more than they take out			1
“ and those who take out of social security are much more the [ @entity11 ] nationals than the @entity3 citizens , who take advantage of the free movement of people			0
‘ it ’s just a myth to speak about an invasion , this invasion is just not taking place			2
’ at the weekend mr @entity5 said : ‘ my job is to put in place proper controls so people ca n’t come here to claim benefits ; to put in proper controls to investigate that people are n’t being paid less than the minimum wage ; to make sure we deal with illegal immigrants ; to make sure if people ca n’t sustain themselves , they are removed from our country			2
all those steps we ’ll be taking			0
’ the prime minister insisted it was wrong that the @entity11 taxpayer is giving cash to 40,000 children who live elsewhere in the @entity3			1
he added : ‘ there are other @entity22 countries who like me think it ’s wrong that someone from @entity101 who comes here , who works hard - and i am absolutely all in favour of that - but i do n’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in @entity101			0
’ but the remarks triggered an angry response from @entity101 's foreign minister @entity111 accused mr @entity5 of ‘ stigmatising ’ @entity101 by singling out the nation ’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform @entity3 welfare rules			0
mr @entity111 said : ‘ if @entity11 gets our taxpayers , should n’t it also pay their benefits ? why should @entity101 taxpayers subsidise @entity11 taxpayers ’ children ? ’ see the full video at : @entity125			0
