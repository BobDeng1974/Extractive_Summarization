it ’s great fun to fly off on holiday every now and then , but as any health professional will tell you , an airplane cabin is not a healthy environment			1
any time in the sky , from a couple of hours to a whole day or more when crossing multiple time zones is , for the human body , a real challenge			1
aside from the cabin pressure , dry air , and sitting squashed in one place while a small child uses the back of your seat as a punch bag , there are a host of unpleasant things that happen to your body while you ’re travelling			1
on that cheery note , @entity42 has compiled a list of health horrors to watch out for next time you ’re thousands of feet up in the sky … sickness the increased risk of catching a cold is more than 100 times higher on a plane according to the @entity53			1
a recent study showed that when you sneeze on a plane - unless you catch it in the crook of your arm - airborne particles can travel up to 50 feet , dispersing in all directions around the cabin due to plane airflow			1
more serious disease risks include catching food - borne illnesses on the flight such as @entity67 or @entity68 – although these could be caught anywhere			2
excuse me a moment ... being sick on board is just one of many rather unpleasant things that can happen			1
and it 's not so good if you 're the one being sick either @entity78 there ’s a reason those funny looking flight socks are popular			1
a very well - known risk during air travel is developing leg clots or @entity78 , which kills thousands of people every year			1
long periods of immobility increase the risk as sitting and leg room are cramped			2
dehydration and low cabin pressure are also contributors , according to the @entity93			2
the only thing that gets that blood from the lower body back up to the heart is muscle contraction , so move around and flex those leg muscles regularly			2
tastebuds also take a battering while in the sky , which is why food does n't taste as good mid-air breathing difficulties the pressure in an airplane cabin at cruising altitude may make you feel like you are high in the mountains			1
there 's less oxygen available which puts an added load on a system trying to get the required amount of oxygen into the bloodstream			2
and while our usual home environment has a humidity level of about 35 per cent , on a plane it ’s below 25 per cent , which may also disturb breathing			1
hearing problems during any flight that ’s more than four hours , depending on where you are sitting , you are at the threshold for exposing yourself to hearing loss - and the more you fly , the greater the risk			2
the occupational safety limit set by the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) is 88 decibels for four hours and 85 decibels for eight hours , while noise on a plane usually ranges between 95 and 105 decibels , and engine noise during take - off is usually upward of 115 decibels			2
why did i sit so far back ? passengers who tend to sit near the engines for long periods of time are more at risk of developing long term hearing problems passengers stuck in the noisier part at the back of the plane are at an even greater risk for hearing loss than flight attendants who have the freedom to move around			2
on the upside , noise - reducing headphones can cut noise by up to 40 decibels			0
reduction in taste a 2010 study by @entity160 revealed that passengers ’ ability to taste salty and sweet can drop by as much as 30 percent in - flight			0
this is because plane air dries out the mucous membranes in your mouth			0
the solution ? stay hydrated , and stick to sour , bitter , and spicy foods , tastes that are much less affected			0
jet lag medically referred to as ' desynchronosis ' and classified as a circadian rhythm sleep disorder , jet lag is part and parcel of long haul flights			0
after all , the human body was n't designed to leave @entity179 on a wednesday night and arrive in the @entity180 seven hours later			0
short - term problems from jet lag include fatigue , loss of concentration , irritability and loss of appetite			0
more worryingly , a study published in @entity190 in 2007 found that consistent disruption of body rhythms could lead to cognitive decline , psychotic and mood disorders and possibly heart disease and cancer			0
make sure you brush your teeth during a flight to avoid the dreaded bad breath radiation on most international flights , you are exposed to a not entirely insignificant dose of radiation from cosmic rays , which are energetic particles from space			1
the longer the flight and the higher and closer you fly to the @entity209 , the greater the dose			0
on a round trip flight from @entity179 , to @entity212 , for example , you can easily exceed the dose you would get from a chest x-ray			0
scientists say for the average tourist the levels are too low to worry about , but frequent flyers might want to find out more about what levels they are exposed to			1
in the words of one @entity180 scientist ‘ cosmic radiation should not be ignored			0
’ constipation all that sitting causes your metabolic rate and digestion to slow , and causes gas , bloating , and constipation			1
suggestions to avoid it include cutting down on your calorie intake and twist from side to side in your seat to help everything keep moving , while the best way to combat dehydration is simple : drink a lot of water , and avoid alcohol and caffeine			0
wandering around the plane can help combat conditions such as @entity78 but do n't even think of drinking water unless it 's bottled - @entity249 research once revealed that 15 percent of the water on planes contained fecal matter			1
some people advise not using water from the bathroom tap even to wash your hands after going to the loo			0
but if you do , make sure you use plenty of soap			0
best of all , use antibacterial wipes			0
but worst of all … bad breath many of your body ’s systems slow down when flying , including saliva production , which allows bacteria to flourish			1
food particles left in the mouth produce a sulphur compound and cause bad breath , and over-doing it with sugary drinks , fast food , and sweets also encourages halitosis			1
just as you would at home , eat healthily , drink water and brush your teeth .			0

from sickness at 30,000ft and breathing difficulties to @entity78 ...
frequent flyers can also suffer from bad breath and constipation
