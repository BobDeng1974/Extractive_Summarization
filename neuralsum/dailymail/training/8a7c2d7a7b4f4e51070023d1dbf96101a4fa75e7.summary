by @entity0 published : 10:22 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 10:23 est , 25 january 2013 an elderly patient with suspected heart failure had to wait 18 hours for a bed after she was admitted to @entity4			1
@entity5 , 76 , arrived at a packed @entity6 , @entity7 , south @entity8 , at around 6pm on january 20			1
but at 12pm the following day she was still in @entity4 , as staff had been unable to find a bed for her on a ward			2
@entity5 , who was rushed to @entity4 with suspected heart failure , had to wait 18 hours for a bed her daughter , @entity13 , 56 , from @entity14 , south @entity8 , said she had called a doctor on january 20 when her mother started feeling unwell			1
because of suspected heart failure , an ambulance was quickly called and mrs @entity5 was rushed to @entity7			1
ms @entity13 said : ' the initial assessment was done quickly and the wait for a doctor was a reasonable one			0
' but then she was just left on a stretcher because they did n't have any beds in any wards anywhere			0
' they did n't even have any pillows for her which was a surprise			0
the staff did their best they could by folding up blankets for her			0
' eventually , about 1.50am they got her off the stretcher and into a bed			0
' by 2am i needed to go home and she was in a bed			0
but when i phoned the next day at about 11am or 12pm i was told that she was still in @entity4			2
they still had n't found her a ward			0
' ms @entity13 said her mother , diagnosed with pneumonia , was now well on the way to recovery			0
the hospital has denied reports that ambulances were being diverted away from @entity7 at the weekend			1
but mrs @entity5 's case will raise further concerns about proposals to close @entity55 's @entity4 , putting more pressure on neighbouring @entity7 which would serve 750,000 people across three boroughs			1
ms @entity13 said : ' i have no complaint with the staff - it 's the resources			0
they ca n't keep up with the current demand			0
for someone to sit there and say that it can cope if another @entity4 closes is just ridiculous			2
' @entity6 , @entity7 , was swamped with patients suffering norovirus and the effects of winter weather a spokesman for the @entity75 said : " we have apologised to mrs @entity5 for an unacceptably long wait in @entity4 last weekend			1
' while the vast majority of our patients are treated in @entity4 within the four hour maximum waiting time period , there are times when patients wait longer due to the availability of beds if there are sudden surges in @entity4 attendances or if there are particular issues with discharging patients who are medically fit for discharge			1
' in the small number of cases when a patient does have to wait in the @entity4 department before being admitted to a ward , it is normal practice for spare beds to be brought into the @entity4 patient bays where they are cared for in the same way as if in a ward			2
' last weekend there were unfortunately a number of patients who had to wait for longer than we would have wished and this was in part due to a smaller number of beds being available due to norovirus and a lower than usual number of discharges due to the severe weather conditions			1
