and @entity3 and princess @entity4 received a pair of seriously impressive bent - knee salutations from author @entity8 at a launch party to celebrate the writer 's new historical book			1
the royal pair looked most amused as ms @entity8 - who is close friends with the couple - crouched as low as her indigo satin strapless dress would allow as she greeted them at @entity16 in @entity17 last night			1
hit the floor : @entity8 crouches low as she curtseys for prince @entity4 at the launch party for her new book , the @entity21 , at @entity16 the @entity23 - born author was celebrating the launch of her book @entity26 , which is based upon the lives of eight @entity29 women , one of whom - @entity31 - is an ancestor of princess @entity4			1
ms @entity8 , 56 , a former model who is divorced from music producer @entity34 , attended the regal event with her daughter @entity36			1
princess @entity4 , 67 - whose name is @entity38 - and prince @entity4 , 70 , are the parents of @entity40 and @entity41			0
prince @entity4 is a grandson of @entity43 and @entity44			0
on your knees : @entity47 greets her old friend , princess @entity4 , with a supremely respectful curtsey the ancient art of curtseying - a show of respect to the royal family - hit the headlines in february when a set of rules was revealed regarding to whom the @entity57 should be curtseying , and when			2
the official guide for @entity57 is that if the @entity44 enters or leaves a room , @entity57 curtseys ; if @entity63 appears and is with @entity64 , @entity62 's wife should also curtsey to her			2
but if @entity64 is absent but @entity62 is present , then @entity57 outranks @entity63 , who should curtsey to @entity57			0
this is because @entity62 outranks @entity63 in terms of the lineage , which means that effectively so does his wife while he is present			0
if neither @entity62 nor @entity64 is there , then @entity57 curtseys to @entity63 because , woman to woman , @entity63 is her senior in the firm			0
in the case of @entity78 , born a princess , and princess @entity80 ( the @entity44 's cousin and granddaughter of @entity43 ) , both these women have royal blood in their veins and therefore are more important than @entity57 - unless @entity62 happens to be around , in which case she 's more important than them			1
@entity85 , being married to a royal junior in rank to @entity62 , has to curtsey to them all			2
as for prince @entity90 's daughters , @entity91 and @entity92 , they out - rank @entity57 - but not when @entity62 is in the room			2
old pals : princess @entity4 , in red , greets writer @entity8 at her book launch last night the @entity44 's granddaughter @entity98 - who always conforms to @entity100 protocol when meeting her grandmother - said in 2008 that few people know how to curtsey anymore			1
@entity101 famously refused to curtsey to the @entity44 on a visit to @entity103 in 1997 ' i curtsey to her every time i see her , ' the 27 - year - old told @entity108 magazine			0
' the thing with my grandmother is she is still my grandmother and she 's very approachable , but she 's also from an era where that was how it was done			2
' but there are n't many people who know how it 's done			0
i know because i have grown up with it			0
' when @entity98 collected her mbe in 2006 she jokingly showed others the correct way to greet the @entity44			0
@entity120 : princess @entity4 came prepared for all weathers at the event in @entity16 last night royal wave : @entity3 and princess @entity4 aboard a boat during the @entity125 on the @entity126 this summer			1
