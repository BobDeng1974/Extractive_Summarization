knowledge is power - or at least that ’s what we ’ve been led to believe			0
but knowing too much could accidentally trigger a countdown to @entity5 , according to two @entity7 physicists			2
the scientific theory suggests we may have nudged the universe closer to its death just by looking at it			2
@entity7 researchers argue that continuous observation of the universe might put it into a state that will destroy us the double - slit experiment reveals how the very act of looking can change the behaviour of a particle			1
in the experiment , when scientists shoot a single particle towards a barrier with two slits , the particle behaves like a bullet and travels through one slit or the other			2
yet if no - one watches the particle , it moves in a wave - like pattern			0
this means , bizarre as it sounds , that the particle can travel through both slits at the same time			0
this demonstrates that matter and energy can display characteristics of both waves and particles , and that the behaviour of the particle changes based on a person 's perception and consciousness			1
@entity46 of @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , and colleague @entity50 , claim that astronomers have sped up the process over the past two decades			0
this is because they ’ve dared to measure dark energy , the mysterious force that is driving galaxies apart			0
the researchers , who first proposed their idea in 2007 , argue that continuous observation of the universe might put it into a state that will destroy us all			0
their theory relates to a strange property of quantum physics which controls the behaviour of subatomic particles and possibly the whole universe			1
the good news is that if we stop looking , the universe could shift to a state at which its decay much slower @entity78 's cat is a thought experiment created by @entity80 physicist @entity78 in 1935			1
in the hypothetical experiment a cat is placed in a sealed box next to a radioactive sample , a @entity86 counter and a bottle of poison			1
if the @entity86 counter detects that the radioactive material has decayed , it will trigger the smashing of the bottle of poison and the cat will be killed			0
the experiment was designed to show the flaws in something known as the ‘ @entity98 interpretation ’ of quantum mechanics			2
this states that a particle exists in all states at once until observed			2
if the @entity98 interpretation suggests the radioactive material can have simultaneously decayed and not decayed in the sealed environment , then it follows the cat too is both alive and dead until the box is opened			1
quantum systems can shift a particle ’s energy state at random , for example , when a radioactive atom decays			1
some scientists think the universe is overdue for a quantum energy shift that would cause everything to cease to exist at any moment			1
if a collapse occurs , it wo n't exceed the speed of light , so we ’ll probably see it coming , according to @entity124 at @entity125			1
the reason for a collapse , says professor @entity46 , has to do with the strange way quantum states are affected by someone looking at it			1
in the @entity78 's cat thought experiment , a cat in a box whose fate is decided by subatomic particles is both alive and dead until someone lifts the lid and observes it			1
only then is the cat discovered to be either ‘ alive ’ or ‘ dead ’			2
according to a law known as the ‘ quantum zeno effect ’ , whenever we observe or measure something at the quantum level we set its decay clock back to zero			0
the physicists calculated that observing the effects of dark energy may have reset the universe 's decay clock			1
the good news is if we stop looking , the universe could shifts to a state at which its decay much slower			0
the same concept applies to the start of the universe			0
professor @entity162 recently told @entity164 magazine that the universe sprang from nothing			0
he says we just happen to live in a universe with the right set of laws to support human life - we would n’t exist otherwise			2
‘ the answer to the question , why is there something rather than nothing , is really quite simple , ’ professor @entity46 said			0
‘ just wait , there wo n’t be for long			0

this is based on strange way quantum states are affected when observed
in @entity78 's cat experiment , a cat in a box , whose fate is decided by subatomic particles , is both alive and dead until someone looks at it
according to two @entity7 scientists , the same thing could happen to the universe , causing an *irreversible* shift in the universe 's energy
some scientists think universe is overdue for a quantum energy change
if shift occurs , it wo n't exceed the speed of light , so we ’ll see it coming
