@entity0 has been accused of blackmail , demanding special treatment and bullying state officials in @entity4 – the country that once dubbed her a ‘ saint ’			1
in an extraordinary outburst , the president of the @entity9 state even told the billionaire singer she ought to take lessons in manners from @entity15 footballers @entity16 and @entity17			2
president @entity18 claims the 54 - year - old , who adopted two of her four children from @entity4 , has failed to keep her promise to spend money improving infrastructure in the impoverished nation			1
in a statement following @entity0 ’s latest visit , president @entity18 accused her of wanting the government to ‘ roll out the red carpet ’ , adding : ‘ if @entity0 believes she deserved to be treated differently			1
it is worth making her aware that @entity4 has hosted many international stars , including @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity16 and @entity17 , who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature			2
’ the singer said she was ‘ saddened ’ by the ‘ ridiculous allegations ’			0
her relationship with @entity4 began with her pledge to donate millions to set up schools , orphanages and medical centres			2
the promise appeared to fast - track her adoption of son @entity53 in 2006			0
she adopted daughter @entity65 in 2009			0
the statement went on to say @entity0 had not been invited by the president - and should stop exaggerating her contributions to the country			2
it said : ' among the many things that @entity0 needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the truth			1
' for her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in @entity4 when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with the manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur			2
' the difference between a school and a classroom should be the most obvious thing for a person demanding state courtesy to decipher			0
' it comes as claims of a feud between @entity0 - who has two adopted children from @entity4 , @entity93 and @entity94 - and the president @entity18			1
the statement said a pop star was not automatically deserving of a state welcome or extra attention			0
' in the feeling of @entity0 , the @entity102 and its leadership should have rolled out a red carpet and blasted the 21 - gun salute in her honour because she believes that as a musician , the whiff of whose repute flies across international boundaries , she automatically is candidate for vip treatment , ' the statement read			2
' granted , @entity0 has adopted two children from @entity4			1
according to the record , this gesture was humanitarian and of her accord			0
' it , therefore , comes across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act , prompted only by her , @entity0 wants @entity4 to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude			1
' kindness , as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned , is free and anonymous			0
' if it ca n't be free and silent , it is not kindness ; it is something else			0
blackmail is the closest it becomes			0
' whistle stop tour : @entity0 is in the country with her adopted @entity4 children @entity130 and @entity53 the statement finished by saying the @entity102 continues to welcome philanthropists hoping to improve the welfare for the people of @entity4			1
the president of @entity4 has given @entity0 an astonishing verbal slap down in which she accuses the pop star of coming close to ' blackmailing ' the impoverished @entity9 country			1
the sarcasm - laden statement criticises @entity0 for believing that ' she is ...			2
doing @entity4 good ' and that she therefore ' automatically [ a ] candidate for vip treatment			2
' after noting that @entity0 has adopted two @entity4 children as her own , the very strongly - worded statement goes on to accuse the singer of near blackmail			1
comes across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act ...			0
@entity0 wants @entity4 to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude			1
' kindness , as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned , is free and anonymous			0
' if it ca n’t be free and silent , it is not kindness ; it is something else			0
blackmail is the closest it becomes ' , the statement , which was reported in @entity4 ’s @entity159 newspaper read			2
@entity0 has been a frequent visitor the impoverished southern @entity9 country since she adopted two children - @entity53 - from there in 2006 and 2009 respectively			1
promotion : @entity0 uses her star power to highlight the struggle for children in @entity4 tour : the executive director of @entity170 briefed @entity0 on what children learn at the centre during her visit skills : @entity0 watched tailoring students work during her visit to the care centre however , the @entity180 ’s relationship with the country has soured , primarily over accusations that she failed to make good on a promise to invest in local schooling			1
@entity4 ’s new , forthright , president dr @entity18 is also reportedly fed up with the pop star ’s portrayal of the country as a helpless basketcase			1
this latest war of words comes after @entity0 was stripped of her @entity192 ( very , @entity192 ) status on a recent trip to the country			2
as a result she and her large entourage - which included four of her children - were forced to go through @entity200 alongside ordinary passengers when they left the country on saturday			0
during the ten days the party had spent in the country , @entity4 ’s education minister accused @entity0 of “ exaggerating ” the extent of her charitable work			1
what ’s more , a handwritten request by @entity0 for an audience with president @entity18 was left unanswered			1
the singer ’s spokesman reportedly claimed that double snub was prompted by president @entity18 ’s sister @entity216 whom @entity0 sacked as the head of her @entity220 charity amid denied allegations of theft			1
trying it out : @entity0 wore a piece of cloth sewn by children at the centre as her adopted son @entity53 watched giving a hand : the @entity231 performer greeted volunteers at the @entity234 orphanage near @entity235 the extraordinary statement from the @entity4 government addressed the singer ’s gripes directly - and contrasts her behaviour with other celebrities including @entity243 footballers @entity53 , @entity16 and @entity17 whom , the statement claims , “ have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature ”			1
the statement reads : “ granted , @entity0 is a famed international musician			2
but that does not impose an injunction of obligation on any government under whose territory @entity0 finds herself , including @entity4 , to give her state treatment			1
' as stated earlier ...			0
such treatment , even if she deserved it , is discretionary not obligatory			0
' it should be put on record that @entity0 did not come to @entity4 at the invitation of the president nor her government			1
in other words , she was neither the guest of the president nor of her government			0
' for all that is known , she came to @entity4 like any other visitor that feels like coming to @entity4			0
such visitors do n’t have to meet with the president and are never amenable to state attention or graces			0
' if the argument is that because she is an internationally renowned star , and , therefore , @entity0 believes she deserved to be treated differently from other visiting foreigners , it is worth making her aware that @entity4 has hosted many international stars , including @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity16 and @entity17 who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature			1
medical support : @entity0 met the patients at the queen elizabeth @entity281 ' among the many things that @entity0 needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the truth			1
for her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in @entity4 when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur			0
the difference between a school and a class room should be the most obvious thing for a person demanding state courtesy to decipher			0
' for her to accuse mrs. @entity216 for indiscretions that have clearly arisen from her personal frustrations that her ego has not been massaged by the state is uncouth , and speaks volumes of a musician who desperately thinks she must generate recognition by bullying state officials instead of playing decent music on the stage			0
” the statement , issued by @entity4 government press officer @entity312 concludes that “ acts of kindness must always remain as such ; they must not smack of blackmail			0
in addition , let philanthropists not hold to ransom the president and any official of her government because they showed some kindness to any @entity4			2
' but a counter statement issued by the popstar accused president @entity18 of telling lies			1
@entity0 said : ' i 'm saddened that @entity4 president @entity18 has chosen to release lies about what we 've accomplished , my intentions , how i personally conducted myself while visiting @entity4 and other untruths			1
' i did not ever ask or demand special treatment at the airport or elsewhere during my visit			0
' i will not be distracted or discouraged by other people 's political agendas			0
' i made a promise to the children of @entity4 and i 'm keeping that promise			2
' getting down : @entity0 has certainly been a hit with the locals who even danced with her			0

@entity4 president @entity18 says star is ' bullying and uncouth '
@entity9 leader calls on @entity0 to ' learn the decency of telling truth '
@entity351 's relationship with nation has *deteriorated* since adopting two children
@entity0 accuses @entity18 of ' releasing lies ' about her visit
