click here to see more of our brilliant @entity1 , including the move for @entity5 's opener is it really only a month since @entity7 headed into the last international break looking every inch a dead man walking , castigated by @entity12 fans campaigning for owner @entity13 to axe their manager ? on sunday at @entity15 , two minutes from the end of his fourth consecutive @entity18 win – and fifth in all competitions – @entity7 gazed up into the directors ’ box looking for @entity13 and gave him an emphatic thumbs - up			1
‘ you can imagine everyone was pulling at him when we were n’t winning and he stuck with me and was very supportive , ’ said @entity7 afterwards			1
‘ you have to have that as a manager			0
you ’ve got to have faith that you ’re doing the right things			0
subs not used : @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 scorers : @entity5 45 , @entity47 62 referee : @entity82 7 attendance : 26,476 ‘ i ’d like to think that buys you a bit of time			1
it bought me just enough time on this occasion			2
’ the last time @entity7 won five games in a row , @entity12 finished fifth in the @entity18 and he won the @entity93 in 2012			1
while that might be too much to ask this season , they are up to eighth place ( check ) following a quite spectacular transformation			0
it has been built on the back of stubborn defence – @entity7 ’s side have not conceded in the last 342 minutes – and the emergence of a new @entity104 hero in @entity5			1
the @entity105 had already repaid the modest £ 1.5million transfer fee @entity12 spent to take him from @entity107 to @entity108 in the summer by scoring the winning goals on his previous two appearances against @entity112 and @entity113			1
yesterday he conjured up a quite sublime finish to set his team on the road to another victory over @entity34			0
a disappointing first half was petering to a close when @entity12 moved the ball out to the right and @entity65 picked out @entity5 ’s run with a low ball into the box			1
the youngster still had plenty of work to do and he produced a fantastic piece of skill , flicking the ball with the inside of his trailing right foot across @entity38 and into the far corner			0
‘ that goal was worthy of winning any game , ’ said @entity7			1
‘ the cross was good but he had to add a little bit of pace with the flick , and that ’s outstanding			2
‘ we worked hard to bring him to the club			0
he was courted by some big clubs , in particular @entity144 , but he genuinely loved the way we were so determined to bring him , and 54,000 @entity12 every week is a big magnet			1
’ @entity47 powers a header past @entity38 in the @entity34 goal , after breaking free from @entity34 defender @entity48 @entity12 captain @entity47 runs away in celebration after his header finds the back of the net , doubling the @entity155 ' lead @entity12 players celebrate in front of the away fans at the @entity15 after @entity47 's header doubled the @entity155 ' lead @entity160 ( left ) is challenged by @entity161 ( right ) during the first half of @entity34 's @entity18 match against @entity12 @entity164 miles @entity34 103.8 64.5 @entity57 90 10.9 6.8 @entity56 90 10.4 6.4 @entity48 90 10.2 6.3 @entity12 113.3 70.4 @entity70 90 11.5 7.1 @entity5 90 11.4 7.1 @entity69 90 11.2 7.0 the @entity12 were jubilant yesterday and had even lit a green flare to match the colour of their team ’s rather questionable change kit just moments before captain @entity47 claimed their second goal just after the hour mark			1
@entity34 failed to clear a corner and the ball was once again played to @entity65 on the right			0
the full - back took @entity54 one way and then twisted back inside him before curling a fantastic cross to the edge of the six - yard box where @entity47 had stayed up and was waiting to power a downward header inside @entity38 ’s near post			1
after winning just once in 15 @entity18 games before the last international break , @entity7 can go into this one satisfied that he is beginning to win over at least some of his harshest critics			1
‘ @entity12 supporters are an extreme of any fan , ’ he said			2
‘ when they win , they go mad and when they lose , they go mad too			2
we were n’t winning games and that is my job , to win games			2
i am not going to get carried away			0
these young players have a lot to learn but so far so good			0
’ for @entity34 boss @entity201 , however , this was a depressing step backwards after taking five points from his last three games			2
there was a significant lack of threat from his team despite enjoying plenty of possession , and their best chance fell to @entity213 11 minutes from time when the full - back miscued horribly wide			2
@entity201 wondered whether @entity218 ’s first @entity217 call - up last week might have somehow contributed to a strangely subdued performance from his top scorer			0

‘ he probably had his poorest game , ’ said @entity201			0
‘ people will ask the question , including myself , if it ’s a result of what has happened during the week but you can have a poor game at any time			0
‘ i would like to think it ( @entity217 ) has given him a massive boost and today just did n’t happen for whatever reason			0
‘ the only pressure on @entity218 is to perform at his best level as often as he possibly can , but we need goals to come from all over the team			0
we just did n’t play well enough today			0
’ @entity34 supporters unveiled a banner in support of @entity12 's @entity277 , who has got the all - clear after his fight with cancer			1

@entity5 opened the scoring just before half - time with an audacious flick to put @entity12 ahead
@entity47 doubled the lead for the @entity155 just after the 60 - minute mark
three points for @entity12 takes them up to *seventh* in the @entity18 table
the win was @entity12 's fifth in a row - a *remarkable* *turnaround* for @entity7 's side
