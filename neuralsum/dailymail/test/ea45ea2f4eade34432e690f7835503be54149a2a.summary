@entity0 would love to see @entity1 and @entity2 light up the @entity4 stage but admits his own swan song hopes look forlorn			1
the king of the baize in the 1980s believes the @entity8 and the doyenne of the women 's tour face tall orders to get through qualifying for the @entity13			0
@entity2 saw her task made all the more intimidating when she was drawn to face 1997 world champion @entity16 on thursday , in the first of three preliminary rounds , while @entity1 will tackle fellow veteran @entity19 in his opener on saturday			1
@entity0 will attempt to qualify for this year 's @entity13 at the @entity4 but @entity0 , who will also attempt to qualify , expects both would relish the challenge if they fought their way through to the first round in @entity25			1
he calls 29 - year - old @entity26 potter @entity2 ' a great player ' , and said of the 10 - time ladies ' world champion : ' it 's a real tough battle out there against players who are playing for their livelihoods			1
it 's a bun fight , but she 's perhaps the best woman player i 've ever seen			0
' in the 1980s i saw @entity36 who was the best around , and she was an excellent , excellent player but more methodical			0
' @entity2 is more like the @entity1 or the @entity37 of the women 's game			1
she has the feel for the game , she 's at one with the table			0
' she could cause a surprise , but to win three matches is the tough bit			0
it 's hard enough for me and @entity1			1
' if me or @entity1 qualify for the @entity4 , it 's arguably as big a win as we 've ever had			1
' i 've got a little bit of a desire to do it , but @entity1 would certainly love to get back to the @entity4			1
' @entity2 takes on @entity54 for a place at the @entity56 in @entity25 @entity2 is a 10 - time ladies champion who previously competed on the main tour for the 2010 - 11 season			1
she suffered 18 consecutive defeats however and failed to qualify the following year			2
@entity1 , who lost six @entity13 finals , last appeared at the tournament in 2006 , and has fallen short in qualifying every year since			1
while 52 - year - old @entity1 is in the autumn of his career , for @entity0 these are the winter years before his match cue is finally laid down			1
he turns 58 in august and fell off the main tour 12 months ago			0
a memoir , @entity68 , hits the bookshelves on thursday			0
a tricky qualifying opener against @entity71 could end in disappointment , but it would be short - lived			2
' i ca n't build up the intensity that i used to have , but i must admit i 'm getting excited about pitting my wits against another generation of players , ' @entity0 said			2
' of course , it 'll all end in tears			0
' i 'm not totally committed but i still have the juices running through me a little bit			2
i 've been practising but it 's not a pretty sight			0
they 're wobbling more in the pockets before saying ' nope '			0
' whether i get to the tv stages , that 's a long shot			0
@entity1 will take on fellow veteran @entity19 in qualifying on thursday ' i was still practising hard even when i was n't getting to the latter stages of the @entity4 , and in the end you have to say , ' yeah , i 've tried , but the price is too much investment of time '			1
' now if i 've lost a match , by the time i 've got in the car i 've thought about what i 'm going to do for the rest of the day , rather than beating up the person who 's come up with me			2
' i think it 's been a bit like @entity105 - i 'm sure in the night that someone swapped me for a more mellow version			0
' @entity0 won six world titles in the 1980s and rolled back the years with a mesmerising return to form at the 2010 tournament , but the 1985 ' black - ball final ' defeat to @entity113 stands over and above all memories			1
@entity113 in action during the memorable 1985 @entity13 final against @entity0 the second autobiography of his career - 34 years after the first - meant @entity0 having to trawl over the emotional wreckage of that night again			1
' i do n't remember anything as much as i remember the ' 85 final , ' @entity0 said			2
' i do remember the last frame , more so because i 've watched it through on video a few times			0
' my career was a blur and all games and matches blur into one in the end , it 's only the strange moments that do stick in your brain			0
' interesting by @entity0 is published in hardback by @entity133 on april 9 , priced Â£ 20 .			2
