@entity0 has backed @entity1 to stop @entity4 ’s £ 32million goal machine @entity2 in his tracks			1
the two title favourites clash at the @entity7 on sunday when @entity1 playmaker @entity0 will come up against his @entity9 teammates @entity2 and @entity10			1
@entity2 has scored seven goals in four @entity13 games since joining @entity4 from @entity14 , but @entity0 is confident that that champions can become the first team to shut him out in the league			1
@entity0 has backed @entity1 to stop @entity4 ’s £ 32million goal machine @entity2 in his tracks @entity2 scored a hat - trick against @entity20 last weekend and is already on seven goals in a blue shirt ‘ @entity2 has made a huge impact , ’ he said			1
‘ it is not easy to adapt but he has clearly done it very quickly			2
‘ he ’s scored seven times so far so that record speaks for itself			2
that ’s very important for @entity4 but not that good for us			1
but we ’ve got a good defence and i believe we can stop him on sunday			2
‘ i have a very good relationship with both players			2
i think @entity4 have made some fantastic signings this summer but our friendship will be set aside because we are going out to win			1
‘ i ’ve known @entity10 since we were 16 - years - old and were in the @entity37 youth squads together			2
‘ i ’m looking forward to facing him but in pretty much every game now i seem to be up against a @entity37 teammate – when we play @entity40 it ’s @entity41 ( @entity42 ) or when it ’s united it will be @entity43			0
‘ but it ’s really all about how the team plays , and our aim as always is to go out and win the game			0
’ @entity2 ’s impact has seen @entity4 set the early - season pace and they can move eight points ahead of @entity1 if they win tomorrow			1
@entity0 was talking at an event to raise awareness about @entity53 ( @entity53 ) @entity2 should be back in the @entity4 starting xi when the teams face each other on sunday @entity0 added : ‘ we need to win because otherwise the gap would be getting too big between the clubs			1
’ meanwhile , @entity1 boss @entity60 believes the death of @entity63 ’s younger brother @entity62 could be behind his loss of form after the @entity67 midfielder was widely criticised following the @entity69 defeat to @entity70 in midweek			1
it followed a turbulent summer in which @entity63 accused the club of not giving him compassionate leave to see his 28 - year - old brother who died of cancer in june			0
‘ maybe some of you think it ’s strange why he is not in the best moment , ’ said @entity60			0
‘ but we started the season and maybe he had a lot of personal problems with his brother – not what was said in the media , but in what he feels about it			0
‘ there are a lot of human things and maybe that is why he is not in his best performance at the moment			0
i think as a team , as a coach , as a club we must support him because he is a very important player and makes a difference			0
‘ but he is always being criticised			0
it is very easy to say he should score 20 goals but must also defend and have better pace , but i do n’t think @entity63 has any problem			2
i ’m sure he will return to his best			0
’ @entity60 added that new £ 32m centre - back @entity103 has not made his debut yet because ‘ he needs some time to understand the way we defend ’			0
@entity0 was speaking as an ambassador for @entity110 , a luxury holiday company based in @entity111 who are leading a campaign called ‘ a new home for @entity115 ’			1
it aims to raise £ 45,000 so the family of @entity118 , a two - year - old boy with a rare condition that affects only five people in the @entity121 , can adapt their home to meet his special needs .			0
