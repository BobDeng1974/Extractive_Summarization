president @entity0 lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the @entity4 on wednesday , saying it could prove to be a short - term solution to the excessive amount of money that 's now spent on elections in the country			1
' it would be transformative if everybody voted			2
that would counteract money more than anything , ' @entity0 told a group of @entity17 , @entity18 , residents			1
' if everybody voted , then , it would completely change the political map in this country			1
' attorney general @entity24 has openly endorsed automatic voter registration , adopted two days ago by @entity26 , the first @entity4 state to officially embrace the measure , but @entity0 had not made his support for either that or compulsory voting clearly known until today			1
president @entity0 lent his support to a movement to implement mandatory voting in the @entity4 on wednesday , saying it could prove to be a short - term solution to the excessive amount of money that 's now spent on elections in the country the president said the people in @entity4 who ' tend not to vote ' are usually younger , of lower income and skew toward ' immigrant groups ' and minority groups			1
' and they 're often the folks who are scratchin ' and climbin ' to get into the middle class , ' he said , ' and they 're working hard			0
' ' there 's a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls , ' he said			1
' we should wan na get them into the polls			0
' the remark as a subtle reference to @entity56 efforts at the state level to pass legislation that would require registered voters to prove that they are who they say that they are at the polls with a government - issued photo identification card			1
@entity56 say that such measures prevent voter fraud			1
@entity66 claim that they stop legitimate voters from exercising their constitutional right to participate in the electoral process			0
many @entity66 believe that 's the point of the laws - to keep groups that traditionally vote @entity73 , especially minorities , from casting a ballot - and have characterized voter id laws as racist for that reason			1
requiring the elderly , who sometimes do n't drive , and minorities , who when they live in major cities often take public transportation , as well as the low - income sector of society , which ca n't afford always afford government identification cards , is a modern day poll tax , @entity66 have argued			1
supporters of the photo id laws have tried to assuage their concerns by setting aside funds for government - funded ids and offering free rides to the @entity93 in certain states			1
@entity0 's @entity95 has taken many of the states that have passed such laws to court , with the notable exception of @entity100 , which put in place processes to counteract the hardship that the new requirement places on certain individuals			1
' it would be transformative if everybody voted			2
that would counteract money more than anything , ' @entity0 told a group of @entity17 , @entity18 , residents			1
' if everybody voted , then , it would completely change the political map in this country			1
' the president is seen here mingling with guests of the event at @entity119 of @entity17 conservatives are opposed to mandatory voting and automatic registration for many of the same reasons they believe states should adopt stricter regulations at the polls			1
in @entity26 , also the first state in the @entity129 conduct its elections entirely by mail - in ballot , @entity56 worry that the mass distribution of millions of ballots by mail , which can easily be tampered with in residential areas , creates an opening for new instances of voter fraud			1
millions of ballots will be sent out and the state has little control over where they end up			0
the cost of implementing the law is also of concern , as the system will ensure that every @entity26 resident receives a ballot unless they opt - out			0
there 's also the question of where the @entity93 can ensure that the personal information it will use to pre-register voters and contact them will remain private			0
automatic registration is popular in foreign countries , including @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 , where it has helped bring the voter participation rate up above 90 percent but remains controversial domestically			1
comparatively , just over half the @entity4 population regularly votes			0
roughly 56 percent of eligible @entity4 cast ballots in the 2012 presidential election			0
@entity166 , which enforces mandatory voting , has a 100 percent rate of participation			2
president @entity0 tours magnet at @entity171 before his speech on wednesday afternoon			2
@entity0 brought up the topic of compulsory voting while giving a long - winded response to an audience member 's question about what can be done to resolve the ' dysfunction ' in @entity180 and lead to overturn of the @entity183 @entity182 decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics speaking at the @entity187 today , @entity0 brought the subject up on his own while giving a long - winded response to an audience member 's question about what can be done to resolve the ' dysfunction ' in @entity180 and lead to overturn of the @entity183 @entity182 decision that allowed a freer flow of money in politics			1
' i do n't think i 've ever said this publicly , but i 'm going to say it now , ' @entity0 said , before bringing up compulsory voting			2
' we should n't be making it hard to vote , we should be making it easier to vote , ' he said			0
recalling his recent speech in @entity202 for the 50th anniversary of ' @entity204 , ' @entity0 said his @entity95 is ' vigorously ' enforcing rights			0
' the notion that this day and age we would deliberately be trying to restrict the franchise makes no sense , ' he said , indirectly knocking conservatives			0
' in @entity166 and some other countries there 's mandatory voting , ' the president , a trained constitutional lawyer , added , saying moments later that it ' may end up being a better strategy in the short - term ' to dealing with franchise issues			1
he followed up the remark by saying that ' long - term i think it would be fun to have a constitutional amendment process about ... how our financial system works			2
' after the smattering of applause died down , he said that realistically , though , that would be a long - term proposition			2
president @entity0 holds a bottle of whiskey as he talks with @entity233 , of @entity234 , during a tour of the @entity236 ( @entity237 ) on wednesday afternoon minutes before , in response to the man 's original question , @entity0 had said he thinks the ' almost unlimited ' amount of money that is spent on @entity4 political campaigns is , in his opinion ' bad for our democracy			1
' ' and i speak as somebody who has raised a lot of money , ' he said , humble bragging			0
' i 'm very good at it			0
' @entity0 said he was ' proud ' of the fact that his presidential campaigns ' refined ' the use of the internet for small - dollar donations			2
' but i also got checks from wealthy people , too , ' he noted			0
' so its not that i 'm not good at it , ' he said , reassuring the audience			0
' i just dont think its a good way for our democracy to work			0
' continuing , @entity0 said the campaign finance system makes @entity268 ' miserable , ' especially those that are in competitive districts , because they constantly have to raise money			2
it also affects legislation , he said , positing that there 's a reason why lobbyists ' have undue influence ' in @entity180			0
and most of the money politicians raise goes toward television ads , he said , which leads to an over-saturated market near major elections			0
' and the nature of just the blitzkrieg , you guys here in @entity18 , you just feel it , right ? ' he said , making reference to @entity18 's status as a decision - making presidential state and therefore a target for tv ads. ' i mean its just every election season , you 've got ta turn off the tv			0
' furthermore , most of the ads are negative because science shows that 's more effective than feel - good messages when it comes to political campaigns			2
and ' it just degrades our democracy , ' @entity0 stated , before moving onto another aspect of the problem .			0

' it would be transformative if everybody voted . that would counteract money more than anything , ' @entity0 said

' there 's a reason why some folks try to keep them away from the polls , ' he said , referencing @entity56 - led efforts in states to pass voter id laws
