it was used as a small harbour office			2
' it has been used for residential purposes for the last 70 years or so but unfortunately we do not know much else about the history of it			2
' the most exciting part of the property would be the fantastic view , it ’s a beautiful location and when it is clear you can see for miles			0
' the turret is accessible and would be a perfect place to stand or sit and look out at the beautiful views , it would be like having your own castle			0
the building is n't expected to be big enough for a family , but it does fit in a narrow utility room , left , while the view of the nearby channel is one of winding hills and water ' the house is two storeys high and has three to four bedrooms in the basement area , one bathroom , a living room and an open plan kitchen and dining room			1
' what ’s interesting about the building is that the whole world has changed around it but it has remained exactly the same after all these years			0
