the ugly @entity1 fallout from the @entity2 has been reignited after @entity3 - the @entity1 wonderkid - hit back at @entity5 - the team 's de facto leader - for his public criticism of @entity10 's captaincy at @entity11			1
@entity5 and @entity3 had forged a close bond on tour , with the former masters , @entity15 and @entity1 @entity17 champion taking the younger @entity18 under his wing and the pair playing regular money games against each other			1
but that has n't stopped @entity3 , 25 , taking aim at @entity5 over the embarrassing character assassination the 44 - year - old dealt @entity10 in september			1
@entity3 , speaking in @entity27 at the @entity29 event won by @entity30 on sunday , not only insisted that any grievances against @entity10 should not have been made in public , but also gave clear backing to @entity10 's captaincy , saying he did a ' great job ' and calling the eight - time major winner a ' legend '			1
' i thought @entity10 did a great job of talking to the guys			2
he had been there plenty of times , and i enjoyed the time i got to spend with him			0
i respect him , he is a legend within the game			0
' some things may have got blown a little bit out of proportion			0
but obviously we did nâ€™t play as well as we needed to in order to win			0
' intriguingly , both @entity3 and @entity5 are on the 11 - man ' task force ' , which also includes @entity63 , appointed to end @entity1 misery in golf 's biennial showpiece ahead of the next match at @entity68 in 2016			1
the @entity1 have lost eight of the last 10 @entity70 against @entity71 , never got close to @entity73 's side in @entity74 , then aired their dirty laundry in public thanks to @entity5 's comments in that now infamous press conference			2
@entity73 ( top ) leads @entity71 celebrations after their victory at @entity11 @entity5 and @entity3 are regular golfing partners and play practice rounds together @entity3 , who finished in the top five at every major championship this year , hinted that the ' task force ' would have some lively discussions over the direction @entity1 golf needs to take to avoid future embarrassment			1
and he admitted one thing @entity5 would surely echo : ' it sucks losing '			2
' i am looking forward to getting together with the guys to see what everyone has to say , ' saifd @entity3			0
' clearly , we want to win the @entity2 , and it is not as if there has been a lack of motivation or anything like that			0
everyone is aware of that and everyone wants to win			0

@entity3 said @entity5 was *wrong* to criticise @entity10
@entity3 insisted @entity10 was a ' great ' captain and a ' legend '
he also said any comments should have been made in dressing room
@entity5 was *scathing* of @entity10 's captaincy after *defeat* at @entity11
