@entity0 by @entity1 might @entity1 be a little hard on herself ? so old that ‘ @entity4 and i were an item , ’ she says			1
and so ugly that ‘ @entity7 saw me naked and shot an arrow into his own head ’			2
she reckons she never appealed to men — ‘ not even my husband ’ , who committed suicide			1
to bring about a radical improvement , she has undergone compulsive plastic surgery — in this diary , she is always off to hospital , for a brow - lift , tummy tuck , chin job , lip implant , or what her doctors call ‘ the usual ’			2
she realises , however , that you ca n’t change in essence what you are — and what @entity1 is , essentially , beyond an 80 - year - old clown with boundless mad energy , is a great and abrasive @entity30 , who , in the streets of @entity32 on an average morning is used to being shoved and banged into and told to ‘ go f * * * myself ’ in three different languages			1
@entity1 is her own crazy creation , as funny and candid as ever reveals all in her new autobiography she loves the cosmopolitanism of her city			1
she gets her pedicures from a @entity43 sex slave , rides in taxis driven by @entity46 ex-cons hiding from the police , and has @entity49 servants who remind her of ‘ @entity50 with sombreros ’			2
it is a characteristic of the professional curmudgeon that hands that could help her regularly get bitten			2
aggrieved she has never enjoyed a film career — if @entity57 wants a ‘ mean , humpbacked jew ’ , for some unaccountable reason ‘ @entity60 always gets those roles ’ — @entity1 has instead made a name for herself on cable television , mocking the celebrities who , in her estimation , are without exception ‘ drug addicts , shoplifters or closet cases ’			1
pretty actresses and models , in @entity1 ’s eyes , are bulimic twits who meet their ‘ tweaked - out gay agents ’ at hangouts such as @entity76 to discuss business ‘ over scrambled egg whites they do n’t eat ’			1
all such sorts do in the first - class cabin on a plane is lock themselves in the lavatory , purging and vomiting			2
then , they go and buy @entity88 children , whom they will love ‘ until they reach puberty and the problems start ’			2
@entity1 is gloriously scornful about the famous			1
@entity93 is ‘ that psychotic bitch ’			2
style , to @entity96 , meant trying to look impressive ‘ while sweating mayonnaise through 60 yards of organza ’			0
@entity1 reveals she began to have plastic surgery on her face when she realised men did n't find her attractive stars who give their offspring silly names get especially short shrift			1
in a sentence that made me laugh out loud , @entity1 says : ‘ i always wanted to ask @entity109 , “ does @entity110 have worms ? ” ’ if little gives @entity1 more pleasure than watching ‘ narcissistic actors pretending to be happy for someone else ’ when they fail to win at an awards show , it would not be true to say that ordinary folk are immune from her wrath			1
indeed , @entity1 ’s disdain is democratically sprinkled about			1
‘ why should blind people have apartments with park views ? ’ she asks , reasonably			0
fussy eaters are an irritation — the ones who keep going through the menu , fretting , ‘ is there alcohol in tiramisu ? is there rum in rum cake ? ’ self - pity annoys her enormously , as victims can be weirdly competitive about their rock - bottom moments : ‘ i was drunk and raped by a gang of 12			0
it was a horrible moment			0
four of them were @entity135 and poorly endowed			0
’ generally , @entity1 ’s complaints are entirely justifiable			1
she resents having to pay taxes to fund ‘ some teenage mother in @entity145 with five kids by seven different baby daddies ’			0
@entity1 loathes waiters who say ‘ no problem ’ , or ‘ no worries ’ , when all you want is a cup of decaf			1
she gets steamed up with the stupidity of bookshop assistants — when she requested @entity157 ’s autobiography , she was asked , in all seriousness , ‘ who ’s the author ? ’ she ca n’t abide it that television now panders only to audiences so idiotic , none can spell ‘ mom ’ backwards			0
interviewers , too , are morons , incapable of deviating from their set list of questions			0
if you say , ‘ i killed my mother ’ , they ’ll ask , ‘ i understand you like shoes ? ’ @entity1 is against the trend for audience participation , for example , @entity175 wanting people to join in the chorus			1
‘ how did singing suddenly become my job ? when i ’m in @entity179 , i do n’t make my audience hold hands and tell the jokes			0
’ the popular comedienne always wanted a career as a @entity57 film star it ’s as bizarre a development as supermarkets suddenly deciding it ’s green not to have shopping bags , which reminds @entity1 of restaurants without plates			1
‘ what do you do ? have the chef throw the food in your mouth ? ’ that ’s a typical @entity1 syllogism			1
she pounces on small - scale annoyances and pumps them up until they are cosmic gripes , with surreal twists			0
‘ if you stutter , ’ she counsels , ‘ do n’t look for work on a suicide hotline			0
d - d - d - d - do n’t j - j - j - jump ! too late ! ’ @entity1 is her own crazy creation , wonderfully lacking in sentimentality , propelled by a healthy rage against political correctness and any form of priggishness			1
‘ happiness is a rich husband with three days to live , ’ is a trade - mark pronouncement			2
@entity215 and half @entity216 , she ’s someone you would n't want to upset			0
‘ i hope she gets run over by a car driven by an uninsured driver , and the ambulance is stuck in traffic , ’ is one of her average witch ’s curses			0
we must be grateful , in the end , for modern developments in police forensic techniques , as ‘ in the good old days , you shot some son of a bitch , pressed the smoking gun into his hand and got away with it ’			0
nowadays , what with @entity237 , high - tech sprays that show up blood , crumb analysis , carpet fibres and so forth , ‘ there ’s just no way a nice person like me can get away with murdering someone who really annoys me ’			0
i know exactly how she feels			0
every good joke told is a homicide averted .			0

@entity1 , 80 , says she never appealed to men , even her own husband
the comedienne calls celebrities ' drug addicts , shoplifters or closet cases '
@entity1 regrets never having enjoyed a *successful* @entity57 film career
