by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 have become used to getting their own way in the world game and think nothing of riding roughshod over both the rules and the ineffectual @entity8			1
yet on friday a supposed hardline former @entity10 judge delivered a verdict that was the equivalent of a massive innings defeat for them			1
@entity14 , appointed by the @entity8 to oversee a case which should never have needed the involvement of a judicial commissioner and lawyers , took one look at six hours worth of evidence and instantly decided that @entity21 had no case to answer			2
what an absolute waste of money			0
common sense prevails : @entity21 has been cleared lf physically assaulting @entity28 ( r ) spat : @entity21 and @entity30 were embroiled in a row as they left the @entity34 pitch delight : @entity21 can not hide his emotions after dismissing @entity30 at the @entity37 yet in a development which left @entity2 both stunned and angry the judicial commissioner quickly decided there was no case to answer for either player			2
it was @entity2 who insisted on bringing a highly unusual @entity46 charge against @entity21 for ‘ abusing and pushing ’ @entity30 which left him facing a four - @entity50 suspension and expulsion for the rest of a series that @entity54 levelled in convincing fashion on thursday			1
they were adamant that @entity21 had crossed a line in making physical contact with @entity30 after the players had left the outfield at lunch on the second day of the first test , raising the stakes and forcing both sides to bring in lawyers			0
yet @entity54 ’s belief that @entity2 ’s provocative move was purely tactical to get their best bowler thrown out of the series was backed up by @entity14 ’s decision to clear @entity21 and uphold @entity2 ’s appeal against a fine levelled against @entity30			1
leader of the attack : @entity21 was man of the match in @entity54 's third @entity50 win at the @entity37 for fourth test vs @entity2 at @entity77 , starting on august 7 @entity78 ( c ) , @entity79 , @entity21 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 ( wkt ) , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89			1
@entity92 , @entity82 and @entity88 , the @entity54 players closest to the incident , were the main witnesses for @entity21 while @entity2 coach @entity93 , captain @entity94 and physio @entity95 were in @entity30 ’s corner			1
@entity21 , man of the match in @entity54 ’s 266 - run victory at the @entity37 , was said to be euphoric after having the potentially serious stain on his record which has been hanging over him during the last two tests removed			2
now , in a huge psychological boost , @entity21 will be free to play at his home ground of @entity77 in next week ’s fourth test after what @entity54 will consider almost as big a victory as the one they gained on the field in @entity109 over the last week			1
ulterior motives ? @entity54 believe that @entity30 's accusations were a purely tactical move by @entity2 his honour @entity113 is @entity10 ’s representative on the @entity8 ’s @entity116 commission			1
these representatives have a background in law rather than cricket — @entity54 ’s representative , sir @entity121 , chaired the investigation into the 1985 @entity124 fire — and , like @entity121 , @entity14 is a retired judge			2
as @entity126 ’s senior code of behaviour commissioner he was the man who suspended @entity127 last year after his attack on @entity87 in a @entity130 bar			0
' i 'm not going to start judging @entity21 on everything he does and does n't do , " he said			0
' what i will say is that at the moment we celebrate the fact that he 's bowling at his best			0
' the whole test , he 's been great			0
but the spell he bowled on the last morning was a real masterclass of swing bowling			0
' ( it was ) on a pitch that was drying , had something in it - but his control of line , length and the decisions he made to put batsmen under pressure was outstanding			0

@entity21 was found not **guilty** of @entity153 **offence** by @entity8
@entity54 *seamer* is free to play remaining tests at @entity77 and the @entity157
@entity2 all - rounder @entity30 was also found not **guilty** of any **offence**
verdict was reached in 10 minutes by @entity10 judge @entity14
@entity164 is delighted to have @entity21 for rest of @entity167 series
