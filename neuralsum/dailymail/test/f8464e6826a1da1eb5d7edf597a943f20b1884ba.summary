@entity1 's claim to crackdown on the super-rich unravelled today after it emerged @entity4 has warned the idea of scrapping non-dom rules would cost the country money			1
the @entity10 leader used a speech to say he will ' abolish ' the 200 - year - old rule for non-doms , which applies to around 116,000 people , claiming they make @entity16 an ' offshore tax haven for a few ' and can ' no longer be justified '			1
but in january mr @entity4 , the shadow chancellor , said : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing @entity16 money because there will be some people who will then leave the country			1
they must prove that they regard a foreign country as their real home			0
but mr @entity1 argues that non-dom tests ' are not very rigorous ' and can be granted to people who have a burial plot or property abroad			1
in a speech in @entity51 today , mr @entity1 said that everyone who has made @entity16 their permanent home should pay full @entity16 tax on all their income and gains			1
he pledged to abolish the non-dom status from april 2016			1
he told an audience at the @entity61 : ' why should there be one rule for some and another for everybody else ? ' it is not fair			2
the next @entity10 government will abolish the non-dom rule			1
' and we will replace it with a clear principle : anyone permanently resident in the @entity16 will pay tax in the same way			1
' the rules we will introduce are modelled on what other countries do			0
real temporary residents , here for a brief period , will only have to pay tax on what they earn here ' because they will be paying their taxes in their place of permanent residence			0
but everyone else will have to pay tax on their worldwide income			1
' the status , which is unique to the @entity16 having been introduced by @entity95 in the late 18th century , is used by more than 110,000 wealthy people			1
in january shadow chancellor @entity4 warned : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing @entity16 money because there will be some people who will then leave the country			1
' mr @entity1 said non-dom status results from a discredited belief that ' anything goes for those at the top and that what is good for the rich is always good for @entity16 '			1
he added : ' there are people who live here in @entity16 like you and me , work here in @entity16 , are permanently settled here in @entity16 like you and me , but are n't required to pay taxes like you and me because they take advantage of what has become an increasingly arcane 200 - year - old loophole			2
' there are now 116,000 non-doms , costing hundreds of millions of pounds to our country – it can no longer be justified , and it makes @entity16 an offshore tax haven for a few			1
' non-dom status is often inherited through the father so can apply to people who were born in @entity16			1
they must pay an annual fee , of up to £ 90,000 , to take advantage of the rules , which means it is only of us to the very wealthy			0
newspaper reports overnight suggested that non-dom rules would be scrapped by @entity10 altogether			1
but today it emerged @entity10 would allow ' real temporary residents ' to take advantage of the rules - with the time limit to be consulted on should they take power in the @entity145 on may 7			1
mr @entity1 said on @entity146 that ' we should all pay taxes by the same rules ' ahead of his speech in @entity152 @entity154 star @entity153 backed the @entity10 tax crackdown entrepreneur and @entity158 star @entity153 has backed @entity1 over the @entity160 's plan to scrap non-dom tax status			1
it comes after the hotelier signed a letter sent to the @entity165 from more than 100 business leaders stating the ' conservative - led government has been good for business ' and backing the cut in corporation tax to 20 %			0
he tweeted : ' @entity1 says he will abolish non-dom status in @entity16			1
this gets my vote i never thought any party would have courage to do this			0
' mr @entity4 said it should be around two or three years - not the five suggested in some reports			0
but it emerged that when he was a treasury minister in the last @entity10 government , mr @entity4 insisted that ' the majority of non-domiciled individuals who had already left the @entity16 spent no more than five years here '			1
and in a january interview mr @entity4 said : ' i think if you abolished the whole status then probably it ends up costing @entity16 money because there will be some people who will then leave the country			1
' asked by @entity194 at the time if he would scrap the status , he said he was looking at tightening the system to ' make sure the non-dom rules work in a fair way '			1
chancellor @entity200 said @entity10 's proposals amounted to ' tinkering around the edges ' not an outright ban			1
' we have @entity4 himself saying it would cost the country money , ' mr @entity200 said on a campaign visit to a bank in @entity211 , south @entity212			0
' it is a classic example of the economic chaos and confusion you get with @entity1			2
it 's why they have no economic credibility			0
' mr @entity200 said the government 's policy of increasing the fees charged to non-doms , which he raised as recently as december , had brought in more than £ 1 billion			0
the @entity224 said the number non-dom numbers ' exploded ' under the last @entity10 government and more than doubled while mr @entity1 was an adviser in the @entity227 @entity229 chancellor @entity200 warned the plan could cost @entity16 ' hundreds of millions of pounds ' and stopped short of scrapping the rules , despite @entity10 's claims @entity234 's party said it would rack up existing fees for non don status as high as £ 150,000 a year the @entity224 were bounced into announcing their own crackdown on non doms by the @entity10 pledge			1
they would rack up existing fees for non don status as high as £ 150,000 a year			0
the party is also considering its own ban on non doms staying in @entity16 longer than a decade			2
but officials said they would not go ahead with this until it was clear it would raise money			0
and officials said there were ' dangers ' that talent could leave the @entity16 if non dom rules were seen to be ' unfair '			2
officials said the plans were in the manifesto but brought forward after @entity1 's announcement			2
the @entity224 would also ban people from inheriting non-dom status from their parent			1
the party 's manifesto will commit to raising the levy on non-doms who have been in the country for more than seven of the past nine years from £ 30,000 to £ 50,000			0
non doms in the country for 12 of the past 14 years would rise from £ 60,000 to £ 100,000 and for people who have been in the country for 17 of the past 19 years from £ 90,000 to £ 150,000			0
mr @entity4 told @entity273 's today that circumstances had changed and there was now a large budget deficit to cut			2
' people were saying in the middle of the last decade this will lead to people leaving the country			0
it 's not actually turned out to be the case , ' he said			0
' the abuse is bigger than we thought			0
these rules are ridiculous , they are unfair , they are being abused , and i think it 's time to act			0
' these were introduced in the period of the napoleonic wars to allow people who were earning money in the colonies not to pay tax in the @entity16			2
' that 's fine , it 's a different world now , a different time , different choices			0
' admitting he was not scrapping non-dom rules completely , he said that @entity10 would allow ' a short period for existing non-doms to get their affairs sorted out '			2
asked about the exemptions , he said : ' what we will do in the future is if people are coming here temporarily to work or to study , then we 'll allow a short period , i think five years is probably too long			0
' i 'm thinking more the length of a normal postgraduate or university degree , say two to three years			0
' mr @entity200 said ' the right approach ' was to hit ' non-doms ' with higher annual charges for exploiting the system - effectively making it only worthwhile for the very wealthiest			0
the @entity224 said they planned to take an additional £ 130 million from non-doms by reforming eligibility rules and ' significantly increasing the charges '			0
chief secretary to the treasury @entity325 said : ' the key tests are what maximises revenue for the exchequer and best supports our economic recovery			0
' ' @entity335 numbers exploded under @entity336 and @entity337 , more than doubling when @entity1 was an adviser in the @entity227 , ' he said			2
' we came down hard on those who stayed in the @entity16 for long periods without paying their share - increasing charges on non-doms year - on - year since 2010			2
@entity10 used to allow non-doms to sit in the @entity345 , @entity224 stopped that			2
' in the next parliament we want to go further by radically reforming the rules and significantly increasing the charges for non-doms to secure an additional gbp130 million for the public purse			0

@entity1 will today pledge to scrap the controversial ' non-dom ' status
the rule allows @entity16 's richest to avoid @entity16 tax on their worldwide income
@entity10 will claim it 's open to abuse and offends the moral basis of taxation
but *critics* will say it is another example of @entity10 's *anti-business* agenda
