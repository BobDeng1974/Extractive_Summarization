a new study has found arsenic could help cut breast cancer deaths it is notoriously poisonous but arsenic may help cut the number of deaths from breast cancer , research suggests			1
a new study carried out in @entity10 has linked the chemical element with a 50 per cent drop in breast cancer deaths			1
scientists at the @entity14 , hailed their findings ' astonishing ' , indicating further trials could pave the way for new treatments			1
the study focused on a region in the @entity22 country where residents had been inadvertently exposed to high levels of arsenic - a naturally occurring element found in many minerals			2
instead of noting a rise in death rates , researchers found breast cancer deaths were cut in half during the period coinciding with high arsenic exposure			2
the effect was more pronounced among women under the age of 60 , with mortality reduced in this group by 70 per cent			1
lead author , professor @entity39 , said : ' what we found was astonishing			0
' we 've been studying the long - term effects of arsenic in this population for many years , focusing on increased disease and mortality attributed to the historical exposure to arsenic in this population			2
' in 1958 , the northern @entity10 city of @entity51 switched to a geothermal water source originating in the @entity54 mountains			2
years later , it was discovered that the water sources contained more than 800 micrograms per litre of arsenic - 80 times higher than the levels recommended by the @entity59			1
an arsenic removal plant was installed in 1970 after some residents began to show the toxic effects from exposure			0
as part of the study , researchers at the @entity65 found human breast cancer cells grown in the lab are killed by arsenic			0
and normal breast cells were also found to be more resistant to the chemical			0
the medicinal use of arsenic is not entirely new			0
a new study carried out in @entity10 has linked the chemical element with a 50 per cent drop in breast cancer deaths			1
the disease is pictured under the microscope in 1958 , the northern @entity10 city of @entity51 switched to a geothermal water source originating in the @entity54 mountains			1
years later , it was discovered that the water sources contained more than 800 micrograms per litre of arsenic - 80 times higher than the levels recommended by the @entity59 arsenic trioxide was approved in 2000 by the @entity89 in the @entity90 , as an effective treatment for a rare type of leukaemia			1
so should the chemical be used to treat breast cancer ? professor @entity39 said : ' not yet			0
we do not know if the treatment will work , but carefully designed clinical trials should take place as soon as possible based on this new evidence			0
' the team of scientists are in the process of designing clinical trials , in which some advanced breast cancer patients would be given arsenic treatment			0
the study was published in the open - access journal @entity109 .			0

study in north @entity10 found chemical is linked to 50 per cent drop in deaths
scientists at @entity14 , @entity14 hailed findings ' astonishing '
focused on the town of @entity51 where arsenic levels in *drinking* water were found to be 80 times higher than levels recommended by @entity59
among women aged under 60 mortality was reduced by 70 per cent
study could pave the way for new treatment to combat the disease
