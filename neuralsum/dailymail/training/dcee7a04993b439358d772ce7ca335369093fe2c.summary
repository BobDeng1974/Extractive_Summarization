he said : ‘ the @entity27 app is a state - of - the - art expression of sir @entity55 ’s principle that ‘ the police are the public , the public are the police ’			1
‘ @entity58 makes it easy for the public to report crime , make statements and file evidence with the police simply and securely			1
an @entity64 - but the free app , which is named ' @entity27 ' , allows users to report the crime without making the call ‘ mobile technology is an incredibly powerful tool and this app will put that power in the public ’s hands so they can help cut crime in their area			1
’ the app is available to download on iphones and @entity80 smartphones			2
in @entity23 and @entity83 , crime reports filled in on the app will be sent to the police headquarters			2

ministers have said they want the police to be more efficient through the use of mobile technology			0

in her speech to the @entity103 ’ conference yesterday she also pledged £ 50million for a new @entity105 designed to help pay for new inventions			0
she said it was currently the ‘ bane of every officer ’s life ’			0
‘ it is central to efficient policing , and we are going to end the situation where a police officer either carries an out - of - date device that can not link him to essential databases , or none at all			0
‘ it is soon going to be possible to connect a range of the most popular mobile devices to national policing systems - and without compromising security			0
‘ this will mean that officers will be able to use an @entity64 ( for instance ) to get on to the @entity99 to check criminal and other records - which will increase their efficiency very considerably			0
