by @entity1 reporter published : 04:57 est , 6 september 2012 updated : 10:36 est , 6 september 2012 a young boy who has never eaten anything in his life has miraculously managed his first meal			0
@entity6 had painful acid reflux when breastfeeding as a baby			1
the youngster from @entity10 developed a fear of eating and drinking and had to be fed by a stomach tube after refusing meals			1
now thanks to pioneering treatment by specialists in @entity18 , @entity6 can sit down and eat a meal with his family			1
progress : @entity6 has now managed to eat two months after taking his first drink at the @entity23 in @entity24			1
his father says he loves biscuits @entity6 in hospital with a feeding tube			1
he now eats meals though some have to be pureed as he has difficulty chewing @entity6 ’s father , @entity34 , 43 , said : ' seeing my little boy able to eat is like winning the @entity37 , the @entity32 and the @entity33 all at once			1
' we still have to puree some of his main meals because chewing can be difficult as he has n’t developed the muscles in his mouth properly			0
' he can eat everything we eat - and he loves chocolate and biscuits			2
' i am the proudest father in the world - this means the world to me and makes me feel like i ’ve finally done my job as a parent			0
' @entity6 was taken to a @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity18 by his parents , @entity52 and @entity53 , where medics used techniques not practised in the @entity57 to make the youngster realise he both needs and wants food			1
they used a variety of in - house methods to persuade @entity6 to become more familiar with food and have fewer worries about putting it into his mouth			2
the treatment has been practised on around 12 people from across the world - all of whom have been successfully cured , and are now able to eat			2
success : @entity6 with his proud parents @entity52 and @entity53			2
they have spent tens of thousands of pounds to encourage him to eat specialists in @entity18 used techniques to make @entity6 realise he needed food it is the second time that the family have visited the treatment centre after they returned two months ago once @entity6 had successfully managed to start drinking - another action he was n’t been able to do since birth			1
@entity52 said : ' when we saw @entity6 drink for the first time , it was an incredible feeling			1
now seeing him eat , we just ca n’t believe our luck			0
@entity53 and i just cried and cried			0
' eating has changed him as a child - his behaviour has changed and he ’s so much happier			0
he ’s a different boy			0
' he ’s costing us a fortune in food now because we want to get him to try new things but it ’s so worth it			0
' @entity6 suffered painful acid reflux as a baby @entity52 and letting manager @entity53 , 39 , were initially turned down funding by their local @entity101 ( @entity103 ) because they both worked			1
despite some funding for this second trip due to their previous success , the couple have been financially crippled by the treatment they have fought for to help their son			0
the family has spent almost £ 25,000 to try and encourage @entity6 to eat			2
@entity52 said : ' we would have liked to stay in @entity18 until @entity6 could eat and drink but the strong financial ties meant we had to take two separate trips			1
' we have had to make huge sacrifices to be able to afford the treatment , and it has cost us a fortune			0
' but , this has allowed our son to become self - sufficient and able to survive as an adult and you ca n’t put a price on that			0
' @entity6 was fed through a tube into his stomach for four years because the memory of the painful acid reflex he suffered during breastfeeding was too strong			1
@entity6 was taught during his first trip to @entity18 to drink through a specially designed water bottle , which contained a milk formula which provided him with all the key nutrients he needed			1
but , throughout @entity6 ’s short life , his parents have faced a constant daily struggle to find a way to help their son eat and drink			1
the youngster had no interest in food as he does n’t understand its purpose and its body did n’t recognise the need or desire for it			0
@entity52 and @entity53 said @entity6 's condition had been tough on his elder sister @entity147 previously , @entity6 would sit at the dinner table during family meal times but had to be entertained with toys			2
boots manager @entity52 said : ' it has been my dream to have my whole family enjoying a meal around the dinner table			0
' the strain on his sister , @entity147 , 10 , has been enormous - to see your brother starving himself would be traumatic at any age , but she has been wonderful and is a credit to her brother			0
' we have fought for five years to get @entity6 to eat and we have always kept an open mind			2
' you have to remain positive even when things get really tough , and it ’s amazing to watch him eat and enjoy his food			0

@entity6 associated painful acid reflux with eating so was fed via a stomach tube
he can now eat and drink after receiving *private* treatment at @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity18
