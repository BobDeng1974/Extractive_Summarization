by @entity1 reporter published : 23:13 est , 6 may 2013 updated : 07:36 est , 7 may 2013 dr @entity2 carried out the research into insomnia and prostate cancer a lack of sleep can double the risk of prostate cancer , a study has found			1
researchers spent five years comparing the health of older men with their sleeping patterns			0
study leader dr @entity2 said : ‘ sleep problems are very common in modern society and can have adverse health consequences			2
‘ women with sleep disruption have consistently been reported to be at an increased risk for breast cancer , but less is known about the potential role of sleep problems in prostate cancer			1
’ her team studied more than 2,000 men aged between 67 and 96			0
they were asked whether they took sleeping pills , had trouble falling asleep , found it difficult to get back to sleep after waking in the night , or woke early and stayed awake			0
among the participants , between 8.7 per cent and 5.7 per cent reported severe and very severe sleep problems			2
none had prostate cancer at the start of the study			0
five years later , 6.4 per cent of the men were diagnosed with prostate cancer			2
compared with those who had no problems sleeping , those with insomnia were significantly more likely to develop the disease			0
insomnia can significantly increase the chance of men developing prostate cancer the risk rose proportionately with the severity of sleep problems , increasing from 1.6 to 2.1 times the usual level			1
the researchers took steps to rule out the possibility that sleep problems were caused by undiagnosed prostate cancer or enlarged prostate glands , which can cause an urge to urinate during the night			1
why poor sleep can affect men 's chances of developing the disease is unexplained			0
dr @entity2 added : ' prostate cancer is one of the leading public health concerns for men , and sleep problems are quite common			1
if our results are confirmed with further studies , sleep may become a potential target for intervention to reduce the risk of prostate cancer			2
' the study , from the @entity73 in @entity74 , was published in the @entity77 journal @entity75			0
each year around 40,000 men in the @entity79 are diagnosed with prostate cancer and 10,000 die from the disease .			1

men with sleep problems more likely to develop prostate cancer
around 10,000 in the @entity79 die from the disease every year
