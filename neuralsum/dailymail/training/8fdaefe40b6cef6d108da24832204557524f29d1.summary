breakfast cereals sold in @entity1 contain as much as 30 per cent more sugar than the same products in the @entity4			1
@entity6 ’s @entity5 is sold as a healthy option for women trying to lose weight but contains 17g of sugar per 100g			1
that is equivalent to more than four teaspoons of white sugar and is 30 per cent more than the 13g of sugar per 100g in @entity5 sold in @entity4			1
manufacturers claim that the level of sugar consumed in breakfast cereals is still low compared to what most people eat throughout the day the @entity1 version of @entity22 , made by @entity23 , has 21.5g of sugar per 100g , more than five times the amount of sugar as the @entity4 version ( 4g per 100g )			1
@entity23 said the @entity1 version of @entity22 more closely resembled @entity22 , a cereal with a similar amount of sugar which is not sold in the @entity1			1
@entity34 flagship health brand @entity32 was found to have 15 % more sugar than the version sold in the @entity4			1
the manufacturer claimed that the difference in levels of sugar was not a result of extra additives in the @entity1 product			2
@entity34 said that the difference was because of ' locally sourced ingredients '			0
calorie content was also found be divergent between @entity1 and @entity4 cereals			1
of the 16 brands of @entity49 's cereals sold in both countries , 11 had had a higher number of calories per 100g			0
for example @entity53 , a chocolate cereal , contains 15 % more calories than the same brand sold in the @entity4			1
the findings come on the back of @entity60 moves to regulate sugar content in products available to children			0
a recent report by the @entity65 for the @entity66 ( @entity67 ) found that @entity69 children were the third fattest in @entity71 , after @entity72 and @entity73 – but almost twice as obese as the @entity74			0
almost 27 % of girls in @entity69 were overweight and 23 % of @entity76 @entity67 estimated that a comprehensive anti-obesity strategy in @entity69 would cost less than £ 12 per person and save 70,000 lives per year			0
the government has responded to the obesity problem by drafting a public health responsibility deal that will require manufacturers to meet a series of commitments			2
@entity23 has already signed up to all commitments , including reducing calories			0
however , @entity49 's have only committed to a reduction in salt content			0
all manufacturers are expect to report on their progress by next month			0
chairwoman of the food network , dr @entity94 , which is involved in the public health deal , said : ' i really would like the rest [ of the cereal manufacturers ] to be as good as the best and that is the refrain i am constantly writing to the food companies - if one company can do it then why ca n't you ? ' this is an even better example - if your company can do it in the @entity4 why ca n't you do it here ? it ; s not that difficult			2
' @entity108 the shadow health secretary , who has been calling for a sugar content cap on cereals at 30 % , said : these finding will shock quite a few people			2
' it seems to be that @entity1 consumers are getting a pretty poor deal			2
' @entity49 's claimed that despite differences in sugar levels , content was pretty low in products in both the @entity4 and the @entity1			1
a spokesperson added the manufacturer creates its products to suit different tastes and palates			0
' when you look at the amounts you are talking about it 's still low when you consider what people eat across the day			0
