prince @entity0 and his ex-wife have secretly splashed out on a @entity3 ski chalet thought to be worth up to £ 13million			1
the @entity0 and @entity4 bought the seven - bedroom property in upmarket @entity6 shortly before @entity7 as a ‘ family investment ’ , with the deeds listing them simply as @entity10 and @entity4			1
it is the same property that the divorced couple were staying in last week when claims that the prince had sex with an under - age girl were made in documents lodged at a @entity18 court			1
sources in @entity3 say the chalet is worth between £ 10million and £ 13million , although it is not clear how much the couple paid			1
it is not known what proportion of the purchase was funded by the mortgage			0
the development shows how close the pair still are even though they separated in 1992 after six years of marriage and divorced four years later			0
but it also raises questions as to how they can afford the chalet , which has up to six permanent staff including a chef			2
@entity0 is not known to have a vast private fortune , while @entity4 only recently managed to clear £ 5million in debts she ran up through a series of disastrous business investments			1
however , the couple did sell their former marital home , @entity51 in @entity52 , which had been a wedding present from the @entity54			0
they received £ 15million for it in 2007 – a price considered to be well above its market value			2
they may still have some money from that , although @entity0 has spent around £ 7.5million on improvements to @entity64 in @entity65 , where both now live despite their divorce			2
prince @entity0 with @entity68 and @entity69 , left , and right , @entity4 in the resort last week @entity71 declined to comment last night			1
but a source close to the duchess confirmed she and @entity0 have bought the chalet jointly as a nest egg for their children @entity68 and @entity69			1
‘ they have bought the chalet as a family investment			1
neither of them have their own property and wanted to buy the chalet as an asset to leave to their children , ’ the source said			1
‘ they holiday in @entity6 several times each year as all the family are keen skiers and it makes sense to have their own place there			1
’ the chalet , which the @entity28 is not naming for security reasons , is in one of the most expensive areas of @entity3 ’s premier resort			2
it has a master bedroom draped in furs , a living room filled with antiques , sauna , boot room , indoor pool and terrace with stunning views			2
@entity108 include sir @entity109 and singer @entity110			0
in 2013 , @entity0 rented the £ 22,000 - a - week chalet for his annual family ski holiday to celebrate his 53rd birthday			1
prince @entity114 was there with his then girlfriend @entity116			2
one of @entity69 ’s best friends , @entity117 was also there last week			2
the chalet was owned by @entity121 , a company based in @entity123 , @entity124			2
getting in the swim : the chalet 's heated indoor pool has stunning views across the resort in the @entity3 @entity130 the sale took several months to conclude , say sources , as deals involving foreign buyers are more complicated			1
the purchase was completed on november 11 but was not legally approved by the @entity3 government until december 19			0
the chalet has been split in two for the purposes of the sale as , according to local regulations , it was too big for a sole foreign purchaser to buy outright			2
legally , @entity0 has the upper floor and attic space , @entity4 the lower floor and basement			1
the chalet is managed for them by a company in @entity6 , @entity149 land registry officials confirmed to the @entity28 that the chalet had been sold to the couple			1
news of the purchase comes as @entity0 faces lurid allegations arising from his friendship with @entity18 tycoon @entity158 , a convicted paedophile			0
in court papers , the prince was accused of having sex with a teenager			1
@entity163 claims she was ‘ forced ’ by @entity158 to have sex with @entity0 when she was 17 – a minor under @entity18 law – and was kept as a ‘ sex slave ’ by the billionaire , who was jailed in 2008 for soliciting sex with minors			1
@entity0 , 54 , fiercely denies ‘ any form of sexual contact or relationship ’ with miss @entity163 and says the claims are false			2
@entity71 says ‘ any suggestion of impropriety with under - age minors is categorically untrue ’			1
the scandal over @entity0 ’s friendship with @entity158 and his continuing globetrotting have led senior politicians to call for more transparency over his public role and how it is funded			0
the prince was forced to quit as an international trade envoy in 2011 after repeated criticism about the post ’s cost and worth to the nation , but last year he still undertook 90 foreign engagements in places as diverse as @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 and the @entity197			1
some of his travel was funded by taxpayers but the cost of many trips was met privately , according to the @entity71 , which has led to concern about who is bankrolling the prince			2
home is where the hearth is : the living room with the log fire to thaw out skiers under new fiscal regulations , the @entity54 now meets the cost of his private office out of her personal fortune , but it unlikely she would pay for the private jets @entity0 regularly uses			0
former home office minister @entity217 told the @entity28 : ‘ it ’s important that people who undertake duties on behalf of the country are transparent in terms of public money allocated for their activities and also for any potential conflict of interest that may exist			0
mps and members of the @entity229 are rightly expected to be open and transparent on these matters and have registers of interest accordingly			0
‘ @entity233 also represent the country and in my view should be subject to the same regime			0
’ @entity238 mp @entity237 , a member of the @entity239 , said the prince ’s private business dealings were a ‘ legitimate area of public concern ’			0
he said : ‘ clearly he should declare not only the costs and details of taxpayer - funded travel , for whatever purpose , but also any business relationship he develops in the course of that travel			0
’ sources close to the prince expressed their frustration yesterday at the way in which his role has been portrayed			1
one royal insider said : ‘ since 2011 the duke and his team have worked hard to carve out a new and clear agenda for him – based around education , technology and start - ups			0
’ last year @entity0 visited more than 30 technical colleges and educational projects around @entity268 and hosted several events to link entrepreneurs with potential investors			0
they made £ 15m from @entity273 ... the @entity0 stood accused of cashing in on his royal links in 2007 after he sold his former marital home , @entity51 in @entity52 , to a controversial businessman from the former @entity278 republic of @entity279 for £ 15million in 2007			1
energy tycoon @entity280 paid £ 3million over the asking price – even though the house , dubbed @entity283 , had languished on the market for more than five years			0
@entity51 , dubbed @entity283 , had languished on the market for more than five years more puzzlingly , the property has since been left empty			0
@entity0 , who has always denied any impropriety , is a close friend of @entity280 ’s father - in - law , @entity279 president @entity288 , who has been mired in accusations of corruption			0
the prince has met @entity288 through his former role as a global trade ambassador , but has also visited @entity279 privately and even joined the president on goose hunting expeditions			0
one of @entity0 ’s closest friends , @entity279 businesswoman @entity296 , had a baby by married @entity280 , and has even previously suggested she was instrumental in helping to seal the deal for @entity299			0
there have also been suggestions that @entity0 may have benefited from a complicated legal arrangement to ensure he was not forced to pay 40 per cent capital gains tax on the sale of what had been a wedding gift			0
inquiries subsequently found that the 125 - year lease was in the @entity54 ’s name			0
and his other home costs just £ 250 a week the @entity312 ’ main family home is @entity64 in @entity65 , a 30 - room mansion once owned by the @entity313			1
@entity0 shares the house with @entity4 and @entity69			1
@entity68 still has a suite there but has her own apartment at @entity318			0
@entity4 recently started renting a flat in @entity320 but still lives at @entity64			1
it has emerged that the prince effectively pays just over £ 250 a week for the residence , having snapped up a 75 - year lease on the @entity326 listed house in 2003 for £ 1million			1
an additional payment of £ 2.5million was waived because the prince had spent more than £ 7.5million on renovations , which include installing an indoor pool and golf driving range			2
if he terminates the lease early he is entitled to claim back up to £ 7million			0

bought seven - bedroom property in @entity6 shortly before @entity7
the deeds listing them simply as @entity10 and @entity4
it 's the same property they were staying in last week when claims that the prince had sex with an under - age girl were made
