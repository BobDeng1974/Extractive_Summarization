by @entity0 published : 13:08 est , 23 august 2012 updated : 13:08 est , 23 august 2012 struck off : @entity2 dr @entity1 has been banned from working as a doctor after making 68 errors on @entity7 victim @entity6 's post-mortem the pathologist who botched the post-mortem examination on @entity7 protest victim @entity6 was banned from working as a doctor today			1
dr @entity1 's actions were found to be ' misleading , dishonest and liable to bring his profession into disrepute ' over parts of his handling of the post-mortem on newspaper vendor mr @entity6			1
a medical tribunal identified 68 failings , including the key fact that dr @entity1 did not tell police that 47 - year - old mr @entity6 suffered injuries that could have been consistent with a baton strike			1
dr @entity1 was found guilty of misconduct at the @entity26 ( @entity26 ) , sitting in @entity27 , and struck off the medical register			1
the doctor , who qualified at the @entity30 in 1974 and has practised as a pathologist for 35 years , was excused attendance but listened in on the hearing by conference call from @entity35			0
the court heard dr @entity1 , who was described as being arrogant and having a bad attitude , was previously investigated on numerous occasions and suspended two times over his shoddy work dating back a decade			2
he had already botched previous post-mortem examinations dating as far back as 2002 by the time mr @entity6 died in 2009			1
dr @entity1 was found guilty of serious misconduct and suspended for four months over his post-mortem examination reports in 2002 into the death of a victim of so - called ' @entity47 ' @entity47			1
the naked body of @entity49 , 31 , was discovered in a room in @entity47 ’s flat in january 2002			0
upset : @entity6 's son @entity52 and @entity53 have been left distraught by his death and she said today @entity1 ' misled everyone ' dr @entity1 explained away her injuries and ruled she died from natural causes			1
in fact she was the first victim of serial killer @entity47 and suspected of having been asphyxiated			0
mr @entity6 , 47 , died on april 1 2009 after he became caught up in the @entity7 riots in the @entity60 as he tried to get home and was forcibly pushed over by pc @entity62			1
dr @entity1 carried out the post-mortem examination on mr @entity6 and concluded that he died from a heart attack , but questions were raised when an @entity67 tourist came forward with a video recording of him being shoved by the officer			1
further medical reports suggested that mr @entity6 died from an injury to his liver that caused internal bleeding and then cardiac arrest			1
at the inquest into mr @entity6 ’s death , dr @entity1 ’s claim that he died of a heart attack was discredited by the jury in favour of the string of experts who said he died of internal bleeding			1
drunk : @entity85 believed mr @entity6 , left , who was drunk at the time , was being deliberately obstructive during the @entity7 protests in april 2009 [ caption fall : after being hit @entity6 fell to the ground but got up , walked 75 yards before collapsing laid out : the 47 - year - old later died in hospital from internal injuries dr @entity1 ’s first post-mortem examination also made it all but impossible to conclude with any certainty how mr @entity6 came to die			1
the inquest jury ruled mr @entity6 was unlawfully killed			2
the police officer who was cleared of killing @entity6 during the @entity7 protests in @entity35 will face force disciplinary proceedings on september 17			2
pc @entity62 was acquitted of manslaughter last month , but police watchdog the @entity102 ( @entity102 ) ordered that he should face the internal @entity104 hearing in public			2
@entity106 confirmed that a gross misconduct hearing in front of a panel of three people including a senior officer and a lay person			0
it is expected to last up to four weeks			0
@entity62 told jurors at @entity115 that he had used only reasonable force , and was cleared of killing the father - of - nine			0
jurors in an inquest into the death had earlier returned a verdict of unlawful killing			0
the officer , 45 , from @entity124 in @entity125 , had a controversial disciplinary record before the fateful day when he came across mr @entity6			2
a series of allegations were made against him over a 12 - year period , and he was allowed to retire from the @entity104 on medical grounds in 2001 despite unresolved disciplinary proceedings			0
later , @entity62 rejoined the force as a civilian worker , before becoming a police officer for @entity125			0
he was then allowed to rejoin the @entity104 in 2004 as part of its @entity136 , specialising in public order			0
the @entity140 @entity139 , chairman of the @entity26 fitness to practise panel , told dr @entity1 today : ' your rigid mind - set , illustrated by your inability to reflect on the case of mr @entity6 and your unwarranted confidence in your own abilities does not convince this panel that it would be appropriate to impose conditions , even with the most stringent supervision , on your registration			1
' the panel considers that you have a deep - seated attitudinal problem			0
you have twice been suspended for your failings in relation to post-mortem examinations you have carried out			2
' you have now appeared before a fitness to practise panel three times			0
the failings against you both historically and presently involve five separate post-mortem examinations			0
' along with mr @entity6 and the @entity47 case , other botched cases conducted by dr @entity1 include those of a four - week - old baby , a five - year - old girl and an elderly woman			1
after the hearing , mr @entity6 ’s family said dr @entity1 should not have been doing the examination in the first place given his record			1
mr @entity6 ’s widow @entity174 said : ' we are n’t surprised he has been struck off			2
it is more of a surprise that he was able to work as a pathologist for so long and that he was selected to do the post-mortem on @entity6			2
' we are pleased that he will not be able to put any more families through the ordeal he caused us , but the damage he has done ca n’t now be undone			0
' last month , @entity183 was found not guilty of the manslaughter of mr @entity6 following a criminal trial			1
evidence about his chequered disciplinary history as an officer was ruled inadmissible and the jury was not told about a series of allegations about his behaviour in the past			0
the officer , who serves with the @entity104 , faces an internal disciplinary hearing being held by his employers next month .			0
