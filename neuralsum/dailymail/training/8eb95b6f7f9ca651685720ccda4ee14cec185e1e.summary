by @entity0 published : 14:07 est , 21 january 2013 updated : 18:26 est , 21 january 2013 given her mother ’s willingness to take on the law for a worthy cause , it ’s little surprise @entity8 ’s daughter has inherited something of a fighting spirit			0
but it seems even fearless rock stars get a little anxious when their offspring are the ones doing the protesting			1
@entity15 singer @entity8 , who was once arrested over her animal rights campaigning , has been fretting about whether daughter @entity17 is ‘ warm enough ’ since she joined a group protesting against a new road			1
the 28 - year - old has swapped her comfortable flat for a snow - covered treehouse 15ft off the ground to try to prevent the development tearing through a beauty spot			1
activist @entity26 , daughter of singer @entity8 of @entity15 , and @entity29 of @entity30 , sits in a tree house during a protest @entity17 is opposed to the construction of the £ 94million road			1
( right picture ) @entity17 ( left ) and mother @entity8 at the @entity37 premiere of @entity38 : the future is unwritten miss @entity8 , whose father is @entity29 of @entity30 , said her 61 - year - old mother was ‘ delighted ’ to see her taking a stand , but added : ‘ she ’s my mother so of course she ’s anxious about my health and worried that i ’m keeping warm enough			0
‘ she ’s concerned about things like pneumonia , because it is bitterly cold			0
but she ’s confident that i know what i ’m doing and sensible			0
she knows that we all take very good precautions to make sure we stay healthy			0
’ miss @entity8 said her decision to join the protest group was in part because of the ‘ inspiration ’ of her mother , who was arrested in 2000 for protesting about animal rights outside a @entity60 branch of the @entity62 clothing chain			2
miss @entity8 said : ‘ she ’s been a great influence on me , and one of the reasons we are so opposed to this road is because of the impact it will have on animals in the area			2
‘ this is a wildlife haven and the road will destroy much of that			2
miss @entity8 has joined protestors who say the construction of the road will destroy the unspoilt @entity79 no - frills : @entity81 faces a spartan existence at the makeshift camp , which stands in the path of the proposed road plan : the proposed route of the new road between @entity89 and @entity90 ‘ but i have also found my own way			1
my main concern is climate change and the increased damage this will do to the planet by increasing emissions			0
‘ we should be encouraging people to drive less , not more			0
’ miss @entity8 moved to @entity100 in @entity101 last year , and joined protesters trying to protect the nearby @entity79 beauty spot just after @entity104			1
developers plan to build a link road that will connect @entity89 with @entity90 , concreting over a swathe of ancient forest and rolling farmland in the process			1
@entity111 said : ' i try to dig an oval - shaped hole which will hopefully support itself , it was perfected by the @entity114 in the @entity115 , and i 'm willing to risk my life ' the @entity117 reported last week how many of those taking part in the protest are in their 50s and 60s and choosing to take up activism rather than wind down to retirement			0
miss @entity8 ’s fellow protesters include 58 - year - old grandmother @entity127 and @entity128 ‘ @entity129 , who dug a tunnel underneath the road building site in a bid to stop the development			1
the group sleep in treehouses made from tarpaulin and cargo netting , huddling under muddy sleeping bags at night			0
miss @entity8 said : ‘ we all work together and have had great support from locals who have brought us wonderful vegan meals that we heat up over a fire in the evening			2
of course , i have to be realistic and say that ultimately we are unlikely to win this battle against the road			2
‘ the main thing is to make a stand and make it as hard as we possibly can for those building it			0
’ many observers say the @entity79 fight has rekindled memories of the ‘ tree people ’ of the 1990s , when dreadlocked protester @entity154 – known as ‘ @entity155 ’ – briefly became a minor national celebrity			1
progress : work is going on around the protesters to clear a path for the road			1

@entity81 is one of fifty activists protesting a new road in @entity101
they live in tree huts and dug tunnels along the route of planned link road
one protester said he was prepared to live in a tunnel for a month to prevent work being carried out
