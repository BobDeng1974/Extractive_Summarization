by @entity0 for @entity1 an advertising campaign by @entity3 has run into embarrassing difficulties after social media pranksters made it look as if a number of world famous sports stars had written crude personalised messages			1
as part of the sportswear brand 's latest promotional campaign , @entity12 users were encouraged to tweet the hashtag # @entity16 , which would then automatically generate a ' personalised message ' signed by one of @entity3 's famous brand ambassadors			1
but as soon as @entity12 wags realised the messages were based on their profile details , they began making subtle alterations to make it look as if superstars such as @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 had written offensive messages			1
with the footballer apparently just days away from sealing a mega-money move to @entity35 , one @entity45 fan did his best to sour any future relationship with fans of the @entity51 club			0
simply by changing his @entity12 profile name , the unidentified user was automatically sent a signed photograph that read : ' @entity35 are w * * * *			1
never stop believing , @entity28			0
' another footballer made to look highly offensive by @entity12 users was @entity29 , whose ' personalized ' photograph was changed to read : ' i spread @entity59			2
appreciate your support , @entity29			0
' immature : the prank was not just reserved for high - profile footballers - even @entity27 was caught out wrong : @entity65 's @entity64 had his ' personalised ' @entity3 message altered too the prank was not just reserved for high - profile footballers , however - even the fastest man in the world was caught out by the hijinks			1
a photograph that appeared to be signed by @entity27 was changed to read : ' i 'm erect			2
forget the pack , follow your instincts			0
' despite inadvertently offending their fans around the world , @entity35 are understood to remain keen on signing @entity28 - although they are expected to face tough competition from @entity79			2
the @entity80 are apparently in favour of a loan deal and are considering the sale of @entity84 to @entity85 - although the @entity86 is not overly keen			0
@entity87 also maintain an interest in @entity28 but would need to sell another non-eu player before being allowed to sign the @entity42 .			0
