by @entity0 published : 15:21 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 03:22 est , 29 january 2013 bacteria get everywhere - even nine miles high among the clouds , a study has found			1
scientists discovered ' significant ' numbers of living bugs in the middle and upper troposphere , the airy layer five to nine miles above the @entity11 's surface			1
the microbes could have a previously unrecognised impact on cloud formation , according to the research			1
@entity17 graduate student @entity16 shows an agar plate on which bacteria taken from tropospheric air samples are growing			2
researchers say there are far more bacteria above the clouds than previously thought @entity25 , a graduate student in @entity26 of @entity11 and @entity27 , takes notes aboard a @entity31 @entity30 gathering samples of microorganisms in the atmosphere long distance travel by the airborne organisms may also help spread infections around the world			1
the bugs were discovered in air samples scooped up by a dc - 8 aircraft flying over both land and sea across the @entity43 , @entity44 and western @entity45			2
samples were collected at altitudes of eight to 15 kilometres ( five to nine miles ) before and after two major tropical hurricanes in 2010			2
scientists are still unsure whether the bacteria and fungi they found routinely inhabit the sky , living off carbon compounds , or are continually borne aloft by winds and air currents			2
lead researcher dr @entity56 , from the @entity17 in the @entity43 , said : ' we did not expect to find so many micro-organisms in the troposphere , which is considered a very difficult environment for life			1
' there seems to be quite a diversity of species , but not all bacteria make it into the upper atmosphere			1
' dna analysis revealed that bacteria made up 20 % of particles previously thought to consist of nothing but sea salt or dust			2
the findings appear today in the journal @entity76			0
marine bacteria were mostly found over the ocean , while their terrestrial cousins tended to occupy the air above land			0
@entity17 researchers study microorganisms gathered from air masses in the middle and upper troposphere			1
shown are @entity16 ( seated ) , @entity56 , @entity86 , and @entity87			0
there was strong evidence that hurricanes affected the distribution and dynamics of microbial populations			0
around 17 different families of bacteria were detected			0
the bugs can help trigger cloud formation by supplying the particles around which ice crystals form			1
' in the absence of dust or other materials that could provide a good nucleus for ice formation , just having a small number of these micro-organisms around could facilitate the formation of ice at these altitudes and attract surrounding moisture , ' said co-author professor @entity111 , also from the @entity17			0
the scientists now want to look more closely at how the bugs survive so high above the ground			0
' for these organisms , perhaps , the conditions may not be that harsh , " said dr @entity56			0
' i would n't be surprised if there is active life and growth in clouds , but this is something we can not say for sure now			0

team say bacteria could affect cloud formation - and even spread *disease* around the globe
