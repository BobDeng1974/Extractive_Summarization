by @entity0 energy firm @entity1 has been accused of issuing demands to customers through an invented firm of debt collectors			1
the @entity7 - owned company , which has seen complaints against it double from december 2013 to march 2014 , has reportedly sent customers in arrears threatening letters from a debt - collection agency called @entity13			1
the letters which have the name @entity13 at the top , threaten recipients with court action and bailiffs			2
but at the bottom of the letter it states that @entity13 is a trading name of npower			1
bottom of the league : @entity1 has suffered the double whammy of falling to the bottom of a customer complaints league while also being accused of sending out letters from a made - up debt collection agency the @entity32 reports that one example begins ' @entity34 ' before stating ' it 's a legal requirement to send you notice of an intended court summons before it 's issued '			1
@entity1 insists that the firm does exist in its own right , and that it is used as a last resort			0
a spokesman said : ' we use these letters after we have made 4 attempts to communicate with the customer , three of them using the npower logo and letterhead - the other by phone			0
' the purpose of this letter , with a different name , is to make sure the customer knows that the process has reached an escalated stage , when we or an external agency will be pursuing the matter through legal action			0
' however , we are still clear about npower being the sender of the letter and continue to offer help and further time for payment			0
while our letters are already fully compliant , we are looking at their content			0
' but the controversy will be damaging for the supplier , especially given that it comes as @entity71 and citizens advice @entity72 revealed that almost twice as many complaints were made about npower in january to march this year , compared to the last three months of 2013			1
the latest complaints league table released by the consumer charity sees npower firmly at rock bottom in sixth place , with 592.4 per every 100,000 customers in january to march 2014 , or one complaint for every 168.8			1
the firm said that a system switchover has precipitated a host of issues for consumers , and claim that other power suppliers will encounter a similar issue when changing their systems			2
@entity91 sits just above them in fifth , but , worryingly , citizens advice also said that complaints about all suppliers have increased			2
@entity96 : @entity1 say switchover to a new system has led to the large increase in customer complaints citizens advice chief executive @entity101 said : ' the knock - on effect of poor billing systems can turn household budgets upside down			2
many people do not have the spare cash to cover the cost of a large bill that suddenly lands on their doorstep			0
' a rise in complaints about all suppliers is concerning			2
suppliers wo n’t win the trust of customers back unless they show they understand what consumers need , recognise the financial pressures many people are under and are able to sort out problems quickly			1
' this is something that all suppliers can act on now			0
' notorious payday lender @entity124 was ordered to pay £ 2.6million in compensation after sending letters threatening legal action from made - up law firms to customers in arrears			1
after conducting an investigation into the practice , the @entity132 reported that the firm wrote to 45,000 customers who had fallen into arrears posing as ' @entity138 ' and ' @entity139 '			0
subsequent investigations found that the names were taken from staff working at @entity124			0
claims then emerged accusing the official @entity144 of using similar tactics , with warnings being sent to graduates by firm ‘ @entity148 and @entity144 ’			1
high - street banks have also been implicated , with @entity150 and its @entity152 arm , along with @entity153 , @entity154 and @entity152 all allegedly sending out letters from what appeared to be independent solicitors when actually they are from the firms themselves .			0

energy firm accused of following in footsteps of @entity124 and the @entity144
alleged that npower set up @entity13 and led customers to believe it was an independent debt collection agency
*scandal* comes as npower slip to bottom of complaints league table
all suppliers urged by @entity71 to act in order to *regain* *public* trust
