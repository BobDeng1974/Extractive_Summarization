the new study comes as @entity35 figures showed last week that more than 20,000 graduates - nine per cent - were unemployed six months after leaving university last year			0
there was also a doubling in the number of university - leavers taking menial jobs such as shelf stackers , garbage collectors and cleaners over the last six years , as thousands failed to land graduate jobs			1
fierce competition : the new study found that more than 20,000 graduates were unemployed six months after leaving university last year @entity50 surveyed 100 top graduate employers including @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 and @entity57			2
