a glorious full moon rises over @entity1 it has earned the colorful name ' @entity3 ' , but not for its appearance the name derives from the pink flowers of spring the moon takes on a pink glow as it rises in the post-sunset sky by @entity11 published : 23:30 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 03:01 est , 27 april 2013 the @entity1 skyline has the ability to take ones breath away at almost any time of day , but it is after dark when the shimmering lights of @entity20 's skyscrapers really stand out against the night sky			1
those looking eastwards at the skyline from @entity24 last night were treated to a ' pink moon ' rising in between the buildings			2
traditionally , the april full moon is known as " the @entity3 , " supposedly as a tribute to the @entity29 or @entity30 , considered one of the earliest widespread flowers of the spring			1
the moon is particularly colourful as it is rising or setting for the same reason that sunrise and sunsets are red and orange			0
when the moon is near the horizon , the moonlight must pass through much more atmosphere than when the moon is directly overhead			0
the moon appears to glow red as the reflected light from the sun is scattered and refracted by thick layers of atmosphere			2
by the time the moonlight reaches our eyes , the blue , green , and purple pieces of visible light have been scattered away by air molecules			0
that 's why you only see yellow , orange , or red			0
it is also caused by the dust particles and other pollutants in the air			0
the phenomenon is known as @entity66 scattering and makes for a beautiful sight both for our eyes and as shown here , the camera lens too ! ' @entity71 ' moon : a full moon rises over the skyline of @entity1 next to @entity74 in @entity20 , as seen from the @entity75 in @entity76 why does the moon look orange or pink ? this is because the light from the moon passes through a thick layer of atmosphere which refracts the sunlight reflecting off of the moon as it is rising			1
this combined with air pollution provides its distinct colour moonlighting : people watch the full moon as it rises over the skyline of @entity1 near @entity92 as seen across the @entity93 in @entity94 a supernatural delight : the moon appears to be as bright as some of the tallest buildings and busiest parts of @entity1			1
the brightness of @entity101 can be seen directly below the moon 's rays a fine and natural sight : @entity1 bathed in the moonlight 80s lyrics come to mind : when you get caught between the moon and @entity1 ...			2
