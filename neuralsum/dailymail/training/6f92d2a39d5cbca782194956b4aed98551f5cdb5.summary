by @entity1 reporter published : 19:23 est , 28 february 2014 updated : 06:47 est , 2 march 2014 attorneys for a former @entity5 teacher who raped a 14 - year - old student have argued that his 30 days in prison were enough punishment and he should nâ€™t serve out the rest of his term			1
prosecutors want to send freed rapist @entity12 back to prison saying in an appeal that he should have served a minimum of four years after pleading guilty last year to sexual assault without consent			1
they suggested the girl bore some responsibility for the rape , and referenced sealed videotaped interviews with her before she committed suicide while the case was pending			2
freed : @entity25 , seen here in august 2013 , was freed from a @entity5 jail after only spending a month in prison for raping his 14 - year - old student , who has since killed herself victim @entity31 was a freshman when she was raped ; @entity12 , then 47 , was her business teacher			1
she committed suicide in 2010 before the case went to trial , an act her mother said was driven largely by the rape			1
in a legal brief that lays out their arguments against the state 's appeal , lawyers for @entity12 cited a ' lynch mob ' mentality following the huge public outcry over the case			1
' the citizens of @entity5 have determined that persons as young as 12 years of age will be held accountable and responsible for their actions in regard to certain types of sexual offenses , ' rambold attorney @entity47 wrote			1
' there is no rational basis to conclude that if the person is 14 years of age , the person can only have responsibility if they are the offender			1
' @entity47 also said the state missed its chance to appeal by not raising the issue during an august sentencing hearing			2
horror : @entity31 , pictured , shot herself dead in her mother 's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail the case gained notoriety after judge g. @entity73 commented during @entity12 's sentencing that the victim ' appeared older than her chronological age ' and ' was probably as much in control of the situation as the defendant			1
' the judge also has cited the video interviews			0
attorney @entity81 , who represented the victim 's estate in a wrongful death lawsuit , said the girl was too young to be complicit in the crime against her			2
' it 's my understanding that the state 's law is at age 14 you can not give consent , therefore you ca n't be complicit in any fashion , ' @entity81 said			2
@entity96 , a spokesman for @entity5 attorney general @entity97 , said the state has 14 days to reply to @entity100 's arguments and would have no immediate comment			0
the latest turn in the case was sharply criticized as ' more victim blaming ' by @entity105 , president of the @entity5 chapter of the @entity107			0
fighting : @entity31 's mother @entity108 has said that she does not feel that justice was served in the case and cites the scandal surrounding the case as the reason her daughter killed herself heartbreaking : @entity108 , seen here at rally in august , held a moment of silence for her daughter ' they are comparing the victim to a sex offender , and that 's not ok			1
she was a victim , not a perpetrator , ' @entity105 said			0
outrageous : attorneys for @entity12 argue that the victim was complicit because she looked older than her age the girl 's death took away the prosecution 's main witness , and @entity12 initially avoided prosecution under a deferred prosecution agreement that included sex - offender treatment			1
he violated the agreement by having unauthorized visits with relatives ' children and having a sexual relationship with an adult woman , according to court documents			0
that re-opened the case and led to the sentence from @entity73 of 15 years in prison with all but one month suspended			2
@entity12 was released in september			1
@entity5 's @entity145 said this week that @entity73 should be censured by the @entity146 for imposing an unlawful sentence and blaming the child victim			0
the panel investigated the case after receiving hundreds of complaints about the judge			0
it 's uncertain whether @entity73 will have a public hearing			0
on feb. 13 , he waived his right to formal proceedings before the commission and submitted himself to justices for punishment			0
he has apologized for his comments about @entity31 and said he plans to retire when his current term expires at the end of the year			0
censure is defined by the commission as a public declaration by the high court that a judge is guilty of misconduct			0
it can be ordered in conjunction with other sanctions but does not require suspension or removal from office .			0

@entity25 was released in september after being sentenced to spend only 30 days behind bars for raping his student
the student later killed herself and her mother said that the 2010 rape was the cause
prosecutors now trying to appeal and make @entity12 spend at least 4 years in jail for the crime
his lawyers argue the month in jail was enough and the victim was *partially* at fault for the rape because she looked older than her age
