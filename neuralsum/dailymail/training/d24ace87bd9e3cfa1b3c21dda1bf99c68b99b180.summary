by @entity0 published : 10:11 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 10:11 est , 25 february 2013 a failed romance wo n't just cost you time , tears and heart ache , millions of @entity1 are finding a relationship breakdown can also bring the additional stress of being credit blacklisted as a result of their ex 's money troubles			2
nearly seven million @entity12 have seen their credit ratings affected by the poor finances of a partner , including many who have long since split with that person			1
but unless they have applied for the equivalent of a financial divorce , even responsible adults could find themselves turned down for a loan or credit card because of a former lover			2
money woes : nearly seven million @entity12 have seen their credit ratings affected by the poor finances of a partner analysts @entity27 estimates up to 6.8 million @entity12 - around one in seven of the adult population - have suffered money troubles because of a romantic relationship			1
almost half of these ( 47 per cent ) have been affected by the problems of an ex-partner and a third ( 33 per cent ) are still affected up to three years after the relationship has ended			0
the survey of over 3,000 adults also found one in four ( 25 per cent ) ex-lovers struggled to get a loan as a result of a former partner 's credit rating and 18 per cent were set a higher interest rate as a result			0
problems occur when unmarried couples get joint loans , mortgages , credit cards or bank accounts - which 57 per cent of the couples said they did to prove how committed they were			1
but if one of the couple gets into financial trouble , even on an individual rather than joint account , the other is listed as being ' financially associated ' and so their rating suffers too			0
@entity60 still ruining your life ? if you do n't want a former flame 's credit rating to affect yours , you need a ' financial disassociation ' this can happen if one of the pair defaults on a loan repayment or does not pay their credit card bill for instance			1
when couples split , it is possible to file for a ' financial disassociation ' , a monetary version of a divorce which means the two individuals are no longer classed as a couple to lenders			1
yet few individuals tend to do this , said @entity27 , even though it could repair any damaged credit rating in as little as nine months			0
@entity27 managing director @entity84 said : ' financial ties , such as a joint mortgage , a joint bank account or a partner 's name on a credit card , will be viewed on a credit report as an ' association ' to your spouse or partner			2
' this association will stay on a credit report - regardless of whether the relationship has ended or not - unless a request to have it removed is made			0
' it can be painful to have to think about finances in the middle of a break - up but it can be the first step towards regaining your financial independence			0

nearly seven million @entity1 had credit ratings affected by the poor finances of a partner , including many who have long since split up
problems occur when unmarried couples get joint loans , mortgages , credit cards or bank accounts
solution is to get a ' financial disassociation ' - a monetary version of a divorce - when separating
