@entity2 scored a stunning goal during @entity1 's 3 - 1 victory against @entity12 on monday @entity12 goalkeeper @entity18 can not get his hands to @entity2 's bullet as @entity12 fall behind on their travels again @entity0 believes he has more in common with former @entity1 prodigy @entity22 , now @entity2 's international captain , and @entity25 's @entity24			1
the @entity1 goalkeeper is confident the youngster can handle the pressure of such comparisons but admits the @entity1 dressing room ensures he remains grounded			1
he has a lot to learn but the thing i love about @entity2 - which i have not seen in a ton of other players , and i think that is why he gets named with some of the best - is he is fearless , ' said the @entity39 international			1
' in this country @entity22 and @entity24 , those guys were ' throwing fire ' in their teens and early 20s , and they flourished and that is why @entity2 is special			1
@entity0 lauded @entity2 as a special talent and said he can cope with the pressure of expectation the @entity1 midfielder wheels away after opening the scoring against @entity12 ' he wants the big moments , he wants the ball and he does n't shy away from it - when i was his age i wanted nothing to do with being near the pitch or the spotlight because it was too daunting but he is special in that regard			1
' i think @entity2 can handle it			1
he enjoys that pressure , he is not afraid of it			0
' his football education has been here and it continues to be here and he has guys around him			0
' as special as he is , we do n't let him drift off with his head in the cloud			0
' @entity2 played in a deeper , orthodox central midfield position against @entity12 instead of his more familiar attacking role			1
@entity2 has had to deal with comparisons to former @entity72 midfielder @entity13 @entity0 said that @entity2 wants the big moments and does n't shy away from the spotlight he excelled there and both @entity0 and manager @entity76 are confident it is something he can do again if required , although @entity78 returns for the trip to @entity80 so he may not be needed			1
' i think he has to learn the intricacies of playing in the deeper role , it is more disciplined , ' added @entity0			2
' @entity85 is a bit more flair , he has a licence to go forward and his tackling does n't have to be as precise			0
' it was a good learning experience for him and we can use him in that position			0
' @entity76 has said previously it may turn out to be @entity2 's best position but the @entity95 wants the youngster to be adaptable			2
' he is someone who can develop into a player who can master a few roles , ' said the @entity1 boss			2
@entity0 reveals the @entity1 players keep @entity2 's feet on the ground ' the most impressive aspect of his goal was how he got into that position - not many players have that power , pace , ball control and ability			1
' i think it ( a deeper role ) suits @entity2 really well			2
with certain players the shorter the distance they have to cover to have an influence in the game the better but @entity2 is the opposite - the more ground he has to cover the more effective he is at times			2
' he controlled the game , not just the goal			0
the way he measured his positioning and tactical awareness was very impressive			0
' that deeper role brings a bit more understanding of being aware of what is around you			0
' you need to have good experience and a good footballing brain because it tests you and gets you thinking all the time , and it is very important young players have to think while they are on the pitch			0
' @entity2 is clearly benefiting from that and i do see him being able to master those two roles			2
