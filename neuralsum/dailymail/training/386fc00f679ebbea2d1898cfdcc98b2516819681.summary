walking home after a particularly arduous night out , you sometimes just feel like a lie - down			2
for one unfortunate friend of mine , that meant seeking shelter under a pile of newspapers on someone 's doorstep			2
if only he had had a shoe tent			0
@entity16 design firm sibling has unveiled an ingenious invention - the walking shelter - that is basically a pair of hi - top running shoes with a full - sized tent cached in the netting on the heel			1
walking home and need a rest ? thank goodness you have a tent stashed in your shoes ! okay , so the design is not the most subtle - the streamlined shape of the trainers is compromised slightly by the bulging fabric stuffed in the netting			1
but , as anyone who has tramped miles across fields to reach their camping spot at a festival will testify , the alternative ( lugging a heavy , cumbersome bag of tent ) is a lot worse			0
dismiss any romantic notion of camping a deux under the stars though - this is less @entity48 and more @entity51 ' fashionista sister 's idea of survival in the wild - with a 21st century fashion update			0
with no poles to hold it up , the wearer has to use their own head , hands and legs as supports - meaning they are likely to get quite wet			1
the trainers are not unlike a pair of regular hi - tops , but with the tent bundled up and cached in netting along the sides and at the rear of the shoe sibling , who created the walking shelter as a conceptual design project rather than intending for it to be used as a fully functioning tent , say the garment is a ' human shelter stored within a pair of sneakers '			1
' stored compactly in integrated net pockets within the shoe , the shelter expands out and around the body to form an enclosure that relies on the human frame as a supporting structure , ' they say			0
' the shelter accommodates for the body in a variety of ways and can be customised by the user to adapt to a variety of contexts and environments			0
' the only drawback ? with no poles or pegs , the person themselves acts as the supports for the tent , making it tricky to pop out to get the beans on the @entity101 stove ... and should it rain , the spontaneous camper 's hands and feet wouldget a little wet , and their head where it touches the canvas			1
to be entirely fair though , the tent was created more as a conceptual design piece than functioning back country gear the trainers , created by @entity16 design firm sibling , feature a pull - out tent that becomes a fully functioning shelter the tent has no poles - making it incredibly light to transport - but less than practical in the wild			1
more of a wind - proof shelter to eat a sandwich than a tent for a night in the back country the tent pulls out rapidly and , once the wearer sits down - they have to provide the support for the tent - the shelter is erected			2

full - sized tent is cached in netting *attached* to hi - top shoes
tent pops up in seconds - but wearer must use head , hands and legs as supports
meant more as a conceptual design project than a fully functioning shelter
