the @entity2 government is making covert cash payments to compensate the families of innocent civilians killed in drone strikes , it has been claimed			1
@entity7 , a @entity8 man whose nephew and brother - in - law were killed in a drone strike in 2013 , says he was given $ 100,000 ' hush money ' after taking his case to @entity14			1
mr @entity7 says he was given the freshly minted bills in a blue plastic bag by officials at the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , who told him the money was from the @entity22			1
@entity7 , 56 , says he was given $ 100,000 in ' freshly minted ' notes by the @entity2 government after he went to @entity14 to protest the killing of two of his relatives in a drone strike @entity29 bin @entity7 , 26 , a police officer ( left ) , and @entity31 , 43 , an imam who had denounced @entity32 , were killed in a drone strike in @entity8 last year @entity29 bin @entity7 , 26 , a @entity8 police officer , and @entity31 , 43 , an imam who had denounced @entity32 , were both killed alongside three suspected militants when a drone unleashed hellfire missiles on their village last year			1
their deaths sparked anti-american protests in the village of @entity43 , and attracted the attention of charity @entity45 who sent lawyers to represent mr @entity7			0
late in 2013 he travelled to @entity14 to speak with congressmen and members of the @entity50 about the deaths of his relatives			2
@entity52 , an @entity53 aide responsible for multilateral affairs and human rights , attended the meeting , along with a junior colleague , mr @entity7 told @entity58			0
while the officials promised to consider what mr @entity7 had told them , no immediate action was taken , and he was left in limbo			0
however on july 8 this year , at 10am , he was called to the headquarters of the @entity19 , who work closely with the @entity65 , where authorities handed him a blue plastic bag filled with notes			1
they told him the money was from the @entity2 government , and that they were only passing it along			2
the $ 100 bills were bound in rubber tape			0
mr @entity7 added : ' the money was almost brand - new			0
the serial numbers were sequential			0
' at first mr @entity7 refused to accept the cash , saying that he wanted a formal apology from the government , not a shady pay - off			0
while the @entity8 government investigated the strike , and awarded mr @entity7 compensation after admitting fault the @entity2 has never acknowledged the deaths ( pictured , mr @entity7 's village after the attack ) mr @entity7 says he was handed the cash by @entity8 security officials in @entity14 , who told him it was from the @entity2 government and that they were passing it along ( pictured , shrapnel from the drone strike ) however after a conversation with village elders , in which they told him how badly the victims ' families were struggling , he agreed to take the money and went back for it the following day			1
he said : ' my family received money from the @entity2 government as an admission of their guilt for " mistakenly " killing our relatives in a drone strike			1
but this is not justice			0
' there are many other families in @entity8 who have lost innocent relatives in @entity2 drone strikes but do not receive hush money for speaking out			1
' if the @entity2 can admit their " mistake " in a back room of the @entity8 security services , they can surely admit it publicly and apologise for what they have done to my family , and many others in @entity8			2
' according to @entity45 , the the @entity53 administration has never publicly admitted that mr @entity7 's relatives were killed in error , or acknowledged that they were innocent civilians			2
mr @entity7 initially refused to take the cash , branding it ' hush money ' , but after village elders reminded him of how much his relatives were struggling , he accepted ( pictured , blood spilled during the strike ) the deaths have also not been investigated , and no formal apology has ever been made			0
@entity8 authorities , meanwhile , readily admitted that mr @entity7 's family had been killed in error , and paid him the equivalent of $ 55,000 compensation after carrying out their own investigation			2
@entity142 , attorney for mr bin @entity7 , said : ' president @entity53 is as reluctant as ever to admit the full extent of the @entity2 drone program in @entity8 – but money talks , even if the @entity147 wo n’t			1
' cash payments without full accountability wo n’t quell the outrage about civilian drone deaths , and continued @entity2 strikes will only bring further instability to @entity8			1
' the victims ' families want and deserve an explanation , while the @entity2 people need to hear the truth about what is being done in their name			0
