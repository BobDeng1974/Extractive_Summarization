' i think that putting a @entity84 meal on the table should be the last thing these people have to worry about , and so my next question was whether i could start a food drive at the store to help them out			0
' collectively , we ’re 300 - plus associates at this store , and i knew that together we could make a difference			1
since then , we ’ve gotten two good - sized boxes of food filled , and i even baked cookies at my home to sell and raise extra money			0
' but what i certainly did n’t expect ? learning that there have been quite a bit of unfavorable media stories out there regarding this drive ... ' i ca n’t reiterate it enough : i was just trying to lend a helping hand			0
there ’s a lot of kindness in this store and a lot of good intentions			0
i do n’t know who these associates are or the details of their situation , and it does n’t matter			0

my store is practicing this for our community right now with a coat drive for an area homeless shelter , and i ’ve been doing my part by washing the coats , so they ’re clean and ready to go			0
about three weeks ago , i wondered if there was anything else i could do closer to home , so i asked our store ’s personnel manager if there were any associates we work with who needed extra help this season			2
two associates are on medical leave of absence and are unable to work , leaving their families who depend on two incomes down to only one			0
i think that putting a @entity84 meal on the table should be the last thing these people have to worry about , and so my next question was whether i could start a food drive at the store to help them out			0

i ca n’t reiterate it enough : i was just trying to lend a helping hand			0
there ’s a lot of kindness in this store and a lot of good intentions			0
