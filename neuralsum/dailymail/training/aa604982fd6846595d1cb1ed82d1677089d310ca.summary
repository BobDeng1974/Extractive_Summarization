by @entity0 @entity2 ’s parents say the ‘ pieces of the jigsaw ’ are fitting together in the investigation to solve the mystery of their daughter ’s disappearance after the discovery of fresh ‘ substantive ’ evidence			1
@entity12 and @entity13 ’s comments yesterday came as detectives revealed they have ‘ the most complete picture to date ’ of what happened when @entity17 , then aged three , went missing in the @entity19 resort of @entity20 on the night of may 3 , 2007			2
@entity21 , which in july launched a new full inquiry into the disappearance of @entity17 , says it has discovered new material after trawling through mobile phone calls made by people in the resort in the days before she vanished			1
crimewatch : a new appeal will be launched later this month to find missing @entity2 the breakthrough will be revealed in a @entity32 special due to be shown on october 14 as part of a fresh appeal for information			1
@entity12 and @entity13 , who will feature in the show , said they were ‘ greatly encouraged ’ by the new evidence			2
in a joint statement , they said : ‘ we are really hopeful the forthcoming appeal on @entity29 will bring further new evidence which will take us a step closer to finding @entity17 and to bringing those responsible for her abduction to justice			1
’ in the programme , police will outline a new theory they say will give a ‘ different understanding ’ about the case			0
detective inspector @entity53 , the senior investigating officer , said : ‘ we believe we have the most complete picture to date of the events surrounding her disappearance			2
new evidence : @entity59 @entity53 believes they have the ' most complete ' picture to date ' we are making targeted and new appeals for help from the public			1
i believe there are people out there who hold the key to @entity17 ’s disappearance , and that so far they may be unaware of that fact			1
‘ through this latest round of publicity we hope to take the next step forward			0
there is a huge public desire to help us			0
’ hopeful : @entity79 is encouraged by @entity21 's findings the log of mobile phone traffic analysed by @entity21 is made up of thousands of calls from people who live in 31 countries			1
as a result , detectives have contacted police forces across the world to identify anyone who was at the @entity19 resort when @entity17 went missing			2
officers have established that the majority of holidaymakers in the resort were from the @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
as a result , the tv special will be aired on @entity96 , @entity99 and @entity103 television			0
it will feature an interview with the @entity106 , while highlighting new leads uncovered by police			0
the programme will also feature a reconstruction of events in the @entity19 resort on the night @entity17 disappeared			0
however , @entity12 and @entity13 have banned the re-enactment of their daughter ’s disappearance from taking place in @entity19 through fear of angering the country ’s police			0
instead they have allowed filming to go ahead in neighbouring @entity122 , with actors playing the roles of the anguished couple			0
a three - year - old child actress , bearing a striking similarity to their daughter , will double as @entity17			0
crimewatch editor @entity130 said : ‘ we are very hopeful this major reconstruction , along with the substantial new lines of enquiry , will prompt viewers with vital information to get in touch with officers in the studio			1
