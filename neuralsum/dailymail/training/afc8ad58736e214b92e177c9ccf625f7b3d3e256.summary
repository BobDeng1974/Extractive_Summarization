when @entity2 turned down the opportunity to sign former @entity5 captain @entity4 for £ 30m , many @entity1 fans thought their boss had lost it			1
having seen transfer window after transfer window with little impact until late august , it ’s hard to blame them			0
but as @entity5 close in on @entity14 for the exact same fee , @entity2 ’s decision has been vindicated			1
@entity2 is said to have ‘ seduced ’ ( steady on ) @entity14 in a private meeting in @entity38 , where he has been commentating for @entity35 television during the @entity41			1
when pictures leaked of the 64 - year - old playing football on the beach in @entity38 while @entity46 and @entity24 signed the likes of @entity48 and @entity49 , social media went into overdrive			0
was this going to be another summer where transfer targets come and go ? would @entity54 again be classed as a new signing ? not this time			0
relief : @entity2 celebrates winning the @entity59 in may and may be celebrating again now even in the imminent arrival of @entity61 are bringing in a proven replacement for @entity63 , but it is that star striker that fans crave			2
the £ 40million plus £ 1 bid for @entity30 last year signalled @entity2 ’s intent to sign a leading goalscorer to partner or play around @entity72			1
and in @entity14 , @entity5 may well be getting the next best thing			1
the @entity74 operates up front for his country in a 3 - 5 - 2 formation , snapping at the heels of defenders , not giving them a moment 's rest			0
supporting cast : @entity35 @entity72 cut an isolated figure up front for @entity5 at times last season acting as the focal point of their attack , @entity14 also drops back to start moves and create for his team - mates ; similar to the role @entity93 takes up at @entity26			1
@entity14 was told by @entity95 team - mates before his move to @entity97 that the @entity98 suited his style more , but his time in @entity23 can only be classed as a success			2
thirty - nine goals from 83 appearances in the league during his three - year stay is one thing , but it is his unselfish movement - either as a no 9 or winger - that helped @entity93 to flourish			0
versatile : the energetic @entity14 is capable of playing in a number of attacking positions for @entity5 @entity72 , @entity114 and possibly @entity115 may not be who @entity14 is used to playing around , but he has proved before he can do it on his own			2
if he can combine the qualities he has shown with @entity17 and @entity26 , there ’s no limit for the 25 - year - old in @entity122			0
and you can thank @entity2 for his arrival .			0

@entity14 set to sign for @entity5 in £ *30million* deal
transfer will go through once @entity26 sign @entity30
@entity5 manager @entity2 *declined* chance to *re-sign* @entity4
@entity14 capture vindicates @entity2 's decision to snub @entity134
