maybe it was all too easy			0
perhaps when he saw the teamsheet , he thought it would be a formality that the record he has been closing in on would be sent tumbling			0
this should have been the night @entity8 moved out on his own			2
a capacity crowd in the @entity16 , the eyes of the world watching and a date against one of the biggest names in football			0
the stage could not have been more perfect for @entity8 to usurp @entity18 , as the @entity20 's all - time scorer			1
the coronation , however , must wait			0
worse still , if @entity22 engages overdrive in @entity23 on wednesday , when @entity25 duel with @entity26 , @entity8 could find himself in third place on the list when @entity30 return to @entity20 combat at the end of the month in @entity33			1
@entity8 failed to overtake @entity18 as the @entity20 's all - time top scorer on tuesday night @entity8 takes on @entity36 defender @entity35 but merely flirted around the edges against @entity36 @entity8 reacts to missed chances as two goals would have seen him write his name into the record books it 's not very often @entity8 disappoints – can you use such a word about one of the greatest players of this , and any other generation ? – but here was one such occasion			1
given a standing ovation at @entity52 when he faced @entity36 last month , this time @entity8 could only flirt around the edges			1
few would have expected this			0
at @entity30 's @entity58 training retreat in the days leading up to this contest , the @entity56 press were asking questions of @entity61 that suggested the two goals @entity8 needed were a formality			1
would he go it alone to get to the magical figure of 72 ? ' i have to speak about @entity8 a lot , ' @entity61 replied , a little wearily			2
' the last time i said it 's hard to find a new word to describe him			1
he ' s a fantastic player and professional and that 's it			2
he works hard for his team			0
' @entity8 congratulates goalscorer @entity75 during @entity30 's victory against @entity36 on tuesday seven - @entity26 six - @entity77 @entity79 - @entity78 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 three - @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 one - @entity36 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity95 , @entity101 he does more than that , of course			1
having scored in each of his last 12 games , @entity8 gives this supreme @entity30 side a devastating cutting edge , frequently adding the stardust that makes them what @entity109 , and many others , describe as ' the best team in the world '			1
yet here it was missing			0
@entity8 was first off the pitch at the final whistle , shaking hands with nobody other than @entity61 , as the @entity120 celebrated a routine 1 - 0 win			1
the cricket score and the slaying of @entity36 's reserves never materialised			2
truth be told , he did n't appear to be in the mood			0
when the teams lined up before kick - off , @entity8 had his back to the fence that kept @entity36 and @entity30 apart			1
there was no dead - eyed intensity , just the feel that he was going out for a training exercise			2
a sense that his night would not go the way he hoped arrived after just five			0
looking to take a pass just outside the centre circle , @entity137 charged into him , spiriting the ball away and sending @entity8 to the turf			2
he jumped , gesticulated and expressed his displeasure but there was no foul			0
the @entity30 star evades the challenge of @entity147 but was unable to find the back of the net @entity8 is halted by @entity151 's arm as @entity36 midfielder @entity137 watches on and races for the ball @entity8 goes to ground under the challenge of @entity36 's @entity156 international midfielder @entity155 had he not seen @entity157 beat away a precise effort in the 10th minute , perhaps he would have ended up with the match ball			1
an early goal would have invigorated him and inflicted a blow into @entity36 's midriff from which they would have struggled to recover			1
but that was as good as it got			0
he got no change from @entity166 – a combination of words few would have expected to be put together – and was restricted to long range free - kicks , which he fizzed at @entity171			0
one such effort in the 34th minute created the greatest theatre of the night.30 yards from goal , the beat of a drum and clapping of hands started slowly and got faster and faster as @entity8 began his run up			2
they expected to scream goal , as they always do , but it was n't to be			0

@entity8 had chance to become the @entity20 's all - time top scorer against @entity36
however , @entity30 star failed to find the target during 1 - 0 victory
former @entity192 forward trails @entity18 by a single goal
