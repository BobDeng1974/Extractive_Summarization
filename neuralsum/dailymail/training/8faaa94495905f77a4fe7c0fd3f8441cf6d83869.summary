by @entity0 a father who lost a leg in a work accident died after taking an accidental overdose of a drug he bought on the internet , an inquest has found			1
@entity8 , 36 , suffered a number of serious injuries when he fell off a ladder in 2011 and was forced to have his lower right leg amputated			1
but he struggled to deal with the pain he experienced after the accident and was allergic to the opiate - based medicines that are usually prescribed			1
desperate to relieve his pain , he decided to buy a drug called @entity19 online			1
@entity8 ( pictured with his son , @entity20 ) , 36 , died of an accidental drug overdose after taking painkillers he bought on the internet			1
he struggled to deal with his pain after losing one of his legs in an accident at work the father - of - one was found unconscious in his bed by his long - term partner @entity30 in january this year			1
he had choked on his own vomit which caused his brain to be starved of oxygen			0
ms @entity30 told @entity34 this week that her partner had bought the drugs on the internet			2
however , he suffered short - term memory problems after the accident and , as a result , took too much of the painkiller			1
sheriff @entity42 , the coroner , said there was no evidence to suggest mr @entity8 had taken the drugs with the intention of ending his life and said it was another episode of the father trying to get pain relief and misjudging the amount he was taking			2
recording a narrative verdict , he said : ‘ @entity8 died as a consequence of excess drugs but taken with probable intent to relieve him from pain			1
’ ms @entity30 , 35 , has now called for more to be done to raise awareness of the dangers of the ‘ easily accessible drugs ’			0
she said : ‘ we are still desperately struggling to come to terms with @entity8 ’s death - it is hard to believe he ’s not coming back			2
mr @entity8 ( pictured with @entity20 ) also suffered head injuries in the accident which left him with short - term memory loss			1
it is believed this caused him to accidentally take too many doses of the painkiller ‘ he knew he was lucky to be alive after the fall and wanted to have a good quality of life and provide for me and @entity20			0
‘ he chose to have the amputation as he knew it would mean less infection and hospital appointments			0
‘ but he struggled to manage his pain due to his allergy and it was very hard watching him suffer			1
i ’ll never forget finding him in bed and feeling so helpless as i knew he had gone			0
‘ these drugs should not be available over the internet and more should be done to raise awareness of the huge risks that come with taking them			0
‘ anyone can buy them which is very worrying and it is clear more needs to be done to regulate this industry			0
‘ i also hope that by speaking out it raises awareness of the importance of employers protecting their staff , particularly when they are expected to work at height			0
‘ companies have a duty to provide thorough training and appropriate work equipment , which was something @entity8 was very passionate about following his injuries , and i ’m determined to spread the message far and wide - it ’s what he would have wanted			1
’ mr @entity8 ( pictured with @entity20 ) died as a result of choking on his own vomit causing his brain to be starved of oxygen mr @entity8 , from @entity112 , was working as a cable fitter when he fell off a ladder in 2011			1
lawyers at @entity116 found he was given a ladder to carry out his work despite it being inappropriate for the task			0
it collapsed under him , sending him plunging more than 12 feet onto the concrete ground below			0
he was rushed to @entity123 by air ambulance and he underwent a total of seven operations to pin and fix his broken bones which included fractures to his arm , wrist , shin and ankle as well as a head injury			1
his right forearm had been shattered and a plate was inserted from his wrist to his elbow			0
he also developed compartment syndrome - when pressure within the muscles builds to dangerous levels causing paralysis and infection - in his leg and made the decision last year to undergo an amputation below the knee			2
mr @entity8 ’s death came just days before a meeting was due with his former employers where it was hoped a settlement would be agreed to allow for aids and equipment , future rehabilitation and care			2
the family is still seeking a settlement for his son , two - year - old @entity20			0
@entity160 , from @entity116 , said : ‘ this is a tragic case			0
@entity8 was desperate to get his life back on track and plan his future with @entity30 and @entity20 , who he was desperate to provide for after being in hospital for much of the first few months of @entity20 ’s early life for ongoing treatment			2
‘ he went through a very painful and difficult time and showed remarkable strength when faced with the life changing decision as to whether to have an amputation			0
‘ however , sadly the pain caused by his injuries proved too much to bear and the only relief @entity8 could find was from drugs he bought over the internet as he was allergic to opiates			1
‘ now @entity30 must bring up @entity20 alone and has many questions about whether more could have been done to help @entity8			2
‘ despite legislation to protect employees who have to work at heights during the course of their job , accidents are still regularly occurring resulting in often devastating consequences			0
‘ @entity188 training and maintenance of equipment will help to combat this and we urge companies to learn lessons from what happened to @entity8 to prevent similar incidents from happening again			2

@entity8 , 36 , fell off a ladder in 2011 and suffered *multiple* injuries
he had to have his right leg amputated and struggled with the pain
he was unable to take opiate - based painkillers due to an allergy
so , he bought a painkilling drug called @entity19 on the internet
a head injury sustained during the accident also left him with short - term memory loss and it *'s* thought he took too many doses of the drug by *mistake*
an inquest heard he died as a result of choking on his own vomit
