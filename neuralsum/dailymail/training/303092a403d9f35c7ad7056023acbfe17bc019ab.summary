by @entity0 newly declassified documents reveal new information about the @entity4 's @entity3 , a plan hatched to secretly salvage a @entity7 nuclear submarine			1
in 1974 , the @entity4 commissioned @entity8 to construct a massive vessel to recover a @entity7 submarine that sank in the @entity11 in 1968			1
some 200 pages on @entity3 , one of the most complex , expensive , and secretive intelligence operations of the @entity15 , reveal previously unknown details of the aborted plan			1
covert operation : @entity20 millionaire businessman , film director , and aviator , @entity8 was contracted by the @entity4 to build a huge vessel to secretly recover a @entity7 submarine according to @entity25 , the submarine was important to the @entity20 because it would enable officials to examine the design of @entity7 nuclear warheads and decipher @entity7 naval codes			1
the @entity30 tried for two months to recover the sub , but the attempts were fruitless			0
@entity8 's vessel , the @entity34 , embarked on a salvage mission in 1974 which was somewhat successful			1
a planned follow - up mission in 1975 was aborted after the top - secret plan was leaked to the press			2
afterwards , the @entity4 refused to comment on @entity3 , neither confirming nor denying involvement with @entity8 's vessel			1
in the recently published @entity44 volume , national security policy : 1973 - 1976 , new details emerge of the plan to covertly steal the sub			2
according to the documents , a team of engineers designed the 618 - foot , 36,000 - ton recovery vessel and commissioned @entity8 's company the @entity51 to build it			1
in order to thwart any suspicions that could be raised by the sight of the gigantic recovery vessel , the @entity4 invented a story that the @entity34 ( @entity57 ) was being built for a private business venture of @entity8 's - mining manganese nodules from the ocean floor			1
the determination reached was that deep ocean mining would be particularly suitable ... mr. @entity8 ... is recognized as a pioneering entrepreneur with a wide variety of business interests ; he has the necessary financial resources ; he habitually operates in secrecy ; and , his personal eccentricities are such that news media reporting and speculation about his activities frequently range from the truth to utter fiction , ' reads a memo from secretary of state @entity75 in 1974			1
colossal ship : the @entity34 , now used for deep sea exploration , shown tied up in @entity80 harbor as the $ 800 million project continued , officials began to raise questions about whether retrieving the submarine was worth the resources being plowed into it , six years after it sank			1
ultimately , a committee decide that the benefits to be gained from examining the submarine were worth the expense			2
in addition , the director of the @entity4 was concerned that canceling the project now would make the government seem ' capricious ' to contractors			2
another memo stated that ' provisions for handling and disposition of the target crew remains are generally in accordance with the @entity102			0
they will be handled with due respect and returned to the ocean bottom			0
' in addition , any personal effects belonging to the dead crew members from the @entity7 submarine would be kept to eventually returned to their families as a way to placate the @entity30 if they discovered the theft of the vessel			1
' culminating six years of effort , the @entity114 is ready to attempt to recover a @entity7 ballistic missile submarine from 16,500 feet of water in the @entity11			2
' the recovery ship would depart the west coast 15 june and arrive at the target site 29 june			0
recovery operations will take 21 – 42 days ( 30 june to 20 july – 10 august ) , ' reads a memo from @entity75			0
the project was given a 40 per cent change of success - apparently an optimistic estimate for ventures of the risk and difficulty that @entity3 posed			1
secrets of the deep : an aerial starboard bow view of a @entity134 ballistic missile submarine like the one that sank in the @entity11 the first salvage mission in 1974 was only partially successful after a portion of the submarine fell back into the water as it was being hauled up by the capture vessel			1
during this time , president @entity142 had resigned and officials were unsure whether the project could remain secret for much longer			0
@entity75 spoke about his concerns to president @entity146			0
' there are so many people who have to be briefed on covert operations , it is bound to leak			0
there is no one with guts left			0
all of yesterday they were making a record to protect themselves about @entity114			0
it was a discouraging meeting			0
i wonder if we should n't get the leadership in and discuss it			0
maybe there should be a @entity164 , ' he said			0
' i have always fought that , but maybe we have to			0
it would have to be a tight group , not a big broad one , ' @entity146 responded			0
' i am really worried			0
we are paralyzed , ' said @entity75			0
in fact , the press was already onto the story , with a @entity172 journalist @entity171 , twice being asked by the @entity4 to delay publication of the story			2
in the end , it was n't the @entity172 that broke the story , it was a gaffe by the @entity4 itself			2
in 1974 , @entity51 was broken into , and thieves stole four boxes of documents - and a memo about @entity3 's true progenitors was missing			1
soon after , @entity185 police were contacted by a person claiming to be acting on behalf of a person in possession of the documents who wanted $ 500,00 for their safe return			2
contractor : the @entity4 did n't want to put contractors like @entity8 offside by cancelling @entity3 trying to deduce whether the thief did indeed have the missing memo , the @entity4 informed the @entity196 about it			1
the @entity196 passed on the information to police , who asked the intermediary whether the thief was in possession of it			0
shortly before the second planned salvage mission , the @entity205 published a report stating that ' reports circulating among local law enforcement officers ' indicated @entity8 ' was contracted to the @entity4 to raise a sunken @entity211 nuclear submarine from the @entity212 … the operation , one investigator theorized , was carried out - or at least attempted - by the crew of a marine mining vessel owned by @entity217 ' after that , it was a free for all and @entity171 published his story - as did several other major newspapers , with the @entity223 and the @entity172 making it their front page			1
contrary to fears of retaliation , the @entity30 did not publicly respond to the reports , hoping to play down its own failure to retrieve the submarine			0
the @entity4 was unwilling to push the @entity30 any further though , believing that ' it seems beyond doubt that the @entity30 would go to great lengths to frustrate or disrupt a second mission			2
' eventually , @entity75 told @entity236 that the @entity30 were stationed at the site of the submarine and would not allow a second salvage mission without a fight			2
the total cost of the ultimately failed mission was $ 800 million - which , reports @entity25 , translates to about $ 3 billion			1
the @entity34 was eventually repurposed to be a deep - sea driller , as per the @entity4 's original fictitious story and last sold to a private company for $ 15 million in 2010 .			1

recently declassified documents shed light on the @entity4 's secretive @entity3
the project was hatched to secretly salvage a sunken @entity7 nuclear submarine
the @entity4 commissioned @entity8 to construct a massive vessel for the task
the hide the true purpose , it created a story that @entity8 would use the vessel for deep - sea mining
@entity3 was ultimately *unsuccessful*
it cost an estimated $ 800 million , or $ 3 billion in today 's *currency*
