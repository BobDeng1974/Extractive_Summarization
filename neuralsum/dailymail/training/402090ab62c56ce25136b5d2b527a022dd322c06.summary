@entity0 , 23 , had a suspected heart attack after being hit with a 50,000 - volt charge from a stun gun when police were called to his home last year five police officers want their identities kept secret at an inquest into the death of an innocent man who was shot with a taser			1
police were called to @entity0 ’s terraced home by his mother during a row with a neighbour last year			1
but the ice cream factory worker , 23 , had a suspected heart attack after being hit with a 50,000 - volt charge from the stun gun			1
now a group of officers involved in the tragedy in @entity25 , @entity26 , have sparked outrage by asking for anonymity when they give evidence at the inquest , which is expected to take place early next year			1
critics have warned the case risks damaging public confidence in the police if officers accused of potential wrong - doing are allowed to hide behind a shroud of secrecy			1
lawyers representing the five @entity41 officers have refused to say why they believe their identities should be protected			1
no information was given during a hearing last month			0
firearms officers are usually granted anonymity during court cases and inquests because of the extreme sensitivity of their jobs and fear of reprisals – or in cases involving terrorism or national security			2
but it would be highly unusual to mask the identities of ordinary officers trained to use @entity58 , which are supposed to be non-lethal weapons but have been linked to at least ten deaths since 2004			2
coroner @entity61 acknowledged a ‘ significant issue regarding the ordinary principles of open justice ’ but has granted an interim anonymity order			0
however , the order is set to be challenged by the @entity72 , lawyers acting for mr @entity0 ’s mother @entity67 and news organisations at a pre-inquest hearing taking place as early as this month			1
@entity73 , the @entity74 , said withholding the names of the @entity41 officers ‘ will not help foster public confidence ’			0
he added : ‘ at the end of the independent @entity72 investigation , when our work is complete , we hope to publish a report in a transparent way			0
’ the @entity0 family are also understood to be pressing for full details of the incident to be made public			2
police – some of whom were armed – were called to deal with a disturbance at mr @entity0 ’s home on the evening of july 10 last year and were initially told he had a knife			1
lawyers representing the five @entity41 officers have refused to say why they believe their identities should be protected			1
above , the force 's headquarters he collapsed after being shot with the taser and was pronounced dead in hospital less than two hours later			0
six weeks before the incident , he had collapsed from an irregular heartbeat and was undergoing tests			0
police have also vehemently denied claims that mr @entity0 was mistaken for a wanted criminal with the same name			2
the case has already been referred by @entity41 to the @entity72 , but its findings will not be published until after the inquest			0
@entity41 and legal firm @entity111 , which is representing the five officers , declined to comment yesterday			0
it comes after a former @entity114 marksman charged with murdering a robbery suspect in 2005 was last week named as @entity116			0
reporting restrictions were lifted because @entity116 has been charged with a crime			0
