a major speech given by @entity2 at the height of the @entity5 peace process was written by one of @entity8 ’s senior aides , it has been claimed			1
@entity9 says he drafted the speech for the @entity12 leader , in which he said could ‘ envisage a future without an @entity15 ’			1
mr @entity9 was chief of staff in @entity16 throughout the @entity8 years , and the revelation he wrote a speech for the @entity20 leader is likely to cause alarm in @entity5			1
the claim focusses on a speech given by the @entity12 president at the @entity42 in @entity43 on saturday october 26 , 2002			1
the @entity44 , signed in 1998 was in danger of collapse , because the @entity15 had failed to fulfil promises to decommission weapons			0
mr @entity9 says in his book that delberatly ambigious language used by both sides in the early stages of the peace process was necessary to secure agreement , but was now becoming a block to peace			0
in extracts of his book published by the @entity58 today , mr @entity9 writes : ‘ we felt that we had to address the ambiguity or lose the agreement , so @entity8 made a speech in @entity63 in which he demanded that @entity12 choose between the @entity64 and the ballot box			1
‘ we were nervous about the response but @entity2 called me a few days later and said , to our relief , it was a good speech			2
to my surprise he asked me if i would draft his response			0
@entity9 was @entity8 's chief of staff for a decade in @entity72 , and played a key role securing the @entity44 which led to peace in @entity5 he added : ‘ i tried to write in @entity20 - speak and composed a passage that ended with ' people ask me do i envisage a future without an @entity15 ? the answer is obvious			1
' ‘ i turned on the television a few days later to see @entity2 deliver the speech unchanged , ’ he adds			2
in the speech , mr @entity2 said : ‘ i want to see an end to all of the armed groups on this island			2
that has to be the aim of every thinking republican			0
so if you ask me do i envisage a future without the @entity15 ? ‘ the answer is obvious			1
and who can influence the @entity15 most ? the @entity35 government - the unionists - the @entity97 government and us as well of course			0
all of us have to make politics work			0
’ a spokesman for @entity12 said speeches and specific phrases were often shared with the @entity35 government during the talks			0
‘ all of this was as part of ongoing efforts to help the situation			0
however , @entity2 is very clear that ' any remarks i made were entirely my responsibility and not scripted by anyone outside @entity12 , ' " they added .			2

@entity9 used ' @entity20 - speak ' after being asked for help with speech
he was ' surprised ' when @entity12 president @entity2 used it in full
