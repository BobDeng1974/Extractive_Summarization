@entity7 's @entity64 : mr @entity9 said a substantial number of @entity4 users are moving from other platforms to @entity7 he told the @entity68 that he was disappointed that the @entity63 release date lags so far behind other markets , a result of the rigid testing systems of authorities and phone networks there			1
