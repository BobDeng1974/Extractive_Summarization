@entity0 will prioritise tying down his existing stars ahead of signing new ones when the transfer window opens at the turn of the year			1
with his @entity8 side still in four competitions , the @entity5 admits he would like to make ‘ one or two ’ additions to his squad in the january window			1
however , with @entity13 out of contract in the summer , @entity12 coming to the end of his deal at @entity17 and @entity18 the subject of constant speculation , @entity0 intends on dealing with current players before his mind turns to fresh faces			1
@entity0 has admitted he will concentrate on keeping hold of his current players when the window opens @entity12 's @entity17 contract ends soon , and @entity8 would like a permanent deal for the striker asked if the priority was ensuring his current stars prolonged their stays , @entity0 replied : ‘ yes , that is the case			1
it is much easier to develop what you have , when you know what you have			2
to get people in , is like getting presents			2
you never know what you get			2
it could be nice or something you have to throw away			2
‘ it ’s very interesting to get presents but it does not always turn out the way you want to			2
‘ but you know what you already have			2
and you know players like @entity12 will be better ( in the future )			1
that ’s the kind of players we want to get in so we can progress as a team and hopefully get to that level we want to be at in @entity57			0
‘ we want to try and get @entity12 to go through			1
keeping @entity18 and @entity59 , these are important			1
there is always speculation over @entity18 , pictured training before @entity8 's game against @entity64 @entity13 ( centre ) is also out of contract in the summer , so @entity0 is looking at keeping hold of him ‘ we also have to look for players who can add to the squad and make them better			1
if we can do that then we will be in a better position in february than we are right now			0
‘ the negotiations ( with @entity72 ) are going on			0
there is progress all the time			0
we will see if we can get what we want			0
if we do , everyone will be happy			0
’ @entity78 , @entity64 and @entity77 stand between @entity8 and progress in the @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 in february while only four points now separates the champions from @entity64 and @entity85 in the @entity86			1
and , although optimistic for what the second segment of the season might hold , defeat at @entity91 last sunday left the @entity5 casting a critical eye over what ’s transpired under his watch so far			1
@entity8 are currently still in four competitions this season , and @entity0 would like to add one or two to his ranks @entity12 has impressed on his loan move from @entity17 this season ‘ when i see the possession and pressure we have and how we are controlling games , it is about getting possession into goal chances , ’ he said			1
‘ with the potential we have , i would give us a five , six ( out of 10 ) maybe			0
‘ we have a long way to go but it is quite good also			0
‘ this club is a sleeping bear			0
it is a huge club , we have so many talented players and good staff			0
' we have just have to have the energy to work and progress , want to learn and get better			0
if you have that you can reach your goals			0
’ meanwhile , @entity120 ’s agent has claimed @entity121 were interested in ending the @entity123 ’s troubled spell at @entity8			1
the on - loan @entity126 winger ’s appeal against his seven - game @entity129 ban for a racial slur on @entity85 defender @entity131 was thrown out last week			0
@entity8 have stood by @entity120 and a deal to cut - short his time in @entity133 would be complicated by the fact they paid @entity126 a year ’s loan fee in the summer			1
agent @entity137 said : ‘ @entity121 have again shown interest in him , but at this stage we do n’t yet know whether the transfer will go through			0

@entity13 is out of contract in the summer , while @entity12 is coming to the end of his @entity17 deal
@entity0 is therefore prioritising tying down his current stars
@entity18 is also the subject of constant speculation
@entity8 are still in four competitions this season , including @entity82
