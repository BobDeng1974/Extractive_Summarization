a 5p charge on throwaway carrier bags came into force in @entity3 yesterday , leaving @entity4 as the only home nation yet to tackle the blight and waste they cause			1
the new levy is designed to encourage shoppers to switch to re-usable bags			2
it is hoped the move will have the same positive effects as in @entity14 and @entity15 , where there has been a massive reduction in the number of bags issued at tills			1
@entity3 has introduced 5p charge on carrier bags , making @entity4 the last home nation to introduce the levy at the same time , profits from the bag charge will be donated to good causes , providing a financial lifeline to charities , particularly those involved in tackling litter and improving parks and green spaces			1
more than 160 retailers including @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 have registered for @entity38 @entity3 ’s @entity37 , launched earlier this year			1
this means organisations have agreed to donate the net proceeds from the charge to good causes			0
the introduction of a charge has proved popular with shoppers where it has been introduced , based on the evidence that it reduces waste , litter and harm to the environment			1
but the @entity54 government in @entity55 has dragged its heels on adopting the system in @entity4			1
@entity4 is expected to see a 5p charge introduced in october next year , however this is not certain and it is wrapped in a series of small print caveats which means it will be more complex and less effective			1
the scheme in @entity4 will exempt small shops , despite the fact the @entity64 say they do now want to be left out			2
the front page from the @entity66 's ' @entity68 ' campaign , which was launched in february 2008 it will also exempt paper bags , despite the fact they are considered more damaging to the environment than plastic in terms of the energy used in production and the gases created when they are dumped			0
the @entity80 ( @entity80 ) , which speaks for the biggest supermarkets and other national chains , said the adoption of the different and ‘ overly complex ’ scheme for @entity4 will confuse shoppers			1
the @entity66 ’s ‘ @entity91 ’ campaign launched in february 2008 called for action to end the waste and litter blight caused by discarded bags			2
the introduction of charges in other countries , from @entity15 to parts of the @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 , has led to reductions of more than 80per cent in the numbers handed out at the tills			0
the @entity3 government estimates that 800 million single - use bags are given out by supermarkets every year in @entity3 alone			1
campaigners hope this figure could be cut by 750million			0
the @entity3 environment secretary , @entity107 , said : ‘ i ’m extremely proud that this landmark legislation is now in force			2
our carrier bag addiction is symptomatic of our throwaway culture and has serious implications for the environment			0
he added : ‘ huge numbers of these bags end up as litter , blighting our communities and clogging up our seas and natural habitats , affecting many sorts of wildlife and marine species in particular			0
‘ we want that to change and for people to stop and think about whether they really need to take another bag			0
alternatives like bags - for - life are easy to get and are much more sustainable			0
’ the @entity129 said the moves in @entity3 highlights the lack of action by the @entity55 government			1
@entity134 , @entity135 , said : ‘ it ’s truly unbelievable that @entity4 is being left behind in this matter			2
@entity3 environment secretary , @entity107 , said he is ' extremely proud that this landmark legislation is now in force ' ‘ despite successful and popular actions from all the @entity143 – the latest from @entity3 – which we applaud , it looks like the @entity4 charge will not follow the successful systems in @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity3 but instead will have caveats for the charge depending on the size of the shop and the type of material			1
’ @entity153 , dr @entity154 , said : ‘ a 5p charge on all single - use carrier bags , regardless of the material they are made from is a really encouraging step forward and millions of bags will now not end up in @entity3 waters thanks to this decision			2
’ she added : ‘ we have strong evidence that turtles and other sea creatures mistake plastic bags for food like jellyfish			0
they eat them and then die a painful death from choking or stomach blockages			0
@entity175 are regularly seen eating bags looking for the food they once carried , and many other animals are known to consume plastic bags accidentally			0
’ @entity129 hopes retailers will donate the charge to environmental organisations that , for many years , have been spending time and money campaigning for a ban on bags and , more importantly , clearing them up			0
the introduction of a charge has proved popular with shoppers based on the evidence that it reduces waste , litter and harm to the environment			1

@entity3 hopes move will have same positive effects as @entity14 and @entity201
areas where it has been introduced has massive reduction in bags issued
it has proved popular with shoppers based on evidence it reduces waste
@entity55 has dragged its heels on adopting the system in @entity4
it is expected to be introduced in october next year , though not definitely
