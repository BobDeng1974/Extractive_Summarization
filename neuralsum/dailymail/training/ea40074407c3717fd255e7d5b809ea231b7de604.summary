@entity1 midfielder @entity0 found the perfect answer to his critics after firing in a spectacular equaliser at @entity5 after just three minutes on the pitch			1
the much maligned @entity8 midfielder received strict orders from @entity1 manager @entity10 on the bench during the first - half			1
@entity13 then ordered the 26 - year - old to warm up on his own during the break before replacing @entity16 with @entity0			1
' ( i knew ) after 30 minutes			0
and then i said ( to @entity0 ) to look what @entity16 is doing because i want you to play , ' said @entity10			2
@entity32 's official @entity31 account tweeted a teasing update at half - time saying ' @entity0 has now taken his tracksuit off , fortunately he has a @entity1 strip on underneath @entity37 '			2
however @entity0 proved his worth immediately			0
the 26 - year - old was sent to warm up during the half - time break on his own before replacing @entity16 @entity40 and @entity0 look glum after starting the match at @entity32 on the substitute bench within three minutes of the restart he won an aerial battle with @entity45 on the edge of @entity32 's area , set the ball up wide on the right , and fired in an unstoppable drive in to the top right corner past @entity52			1
remarkably that was @entity0 's first goal for @entity1 since signing last september and the @entity55 was delighted , ' it was a great feeling			2
i 've waited a long time for this moment , ' he said after the match			0
@entity32 later insisted that the intention of the tweet was to make a @entity62 - style gag about @entity0 ' stripping off ' but instead of being naked under his tracksuit top , he had a @entity1 shirt on			0
@entity32 say it was not meant to be a put - down			0
that joke was probably not worth the effort , in hindsight			0
@entity32 posted this harsh tweet just as @entity0 prepared to come on at half - time at the @entity5 in response @entity1 keeper @entity71 replied to @entity32 's tweet after the match after being told to warm up on his own at @entity5 , @entity0 made an instant impact on the game @entity0 roars in delight after scoring his first goal for @entity1 since signing last september @entity79 not happy after two lost points			1
