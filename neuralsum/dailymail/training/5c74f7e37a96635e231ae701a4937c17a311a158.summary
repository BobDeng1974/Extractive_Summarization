@entity1 manager @entity0 will not be making any more new signings before the transfer window closes on friday night			1
@entity0 , who boosted his squad with @entity6 pair @entity5 and @entity7 signing loan deals until the end of the season last week , was unsuccessful with a £ 3million - plus bid for @entity12 and @entity13 forward @entity14			1
the @entity1 boss was tipped to go back in with an improved offer but said : ' i do n't expect to be too busy now			1
those two signings ( @entity5 and @entity7 ) reach our 25 - man squad limit so i do n't see us doing any more business			1
any more for any more ? west ham manager @entity0 says he 's satisfied with his two new signings raring to go : fit - again @entity1 striker @entity23 trains ahead of the @entity25 match loan star : @entity7 ( right ) was put through his paces in training after signing for the rest of the season ' if one is flagged up that is an outstanding quality player that would make a difference immediately , then we would do something , but the likelihood of that is very slim			1
' @entity5 has swapped @entity38 for a @entity40 survival scrap , while @entity7 has traded @entity41 for the east end			1
seven - cap @entity5 , 31 , is a striker with close to a hundred career goals to his name , accrued at the likes of @entity41 , @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity38			2
he joined the capital club in the summer of 2010 amid rumours of interest from @entity51 , while he won the title with @entity46 during a 2012 loan spell			0
cool head : @entity7 scored a penalty against @entity56 during the @entity59 quarter - final shootout @entity7 , 28 , has also been drafted in to help the @entity1 in their battle to earn @entity40 survival , with @entity0 's men currently in the relegation zone			1
capped 15 times by @entity64 , @entity7 is known to @entity66 fans for scoring a penalty against @entity56 at @entity59			2
the @entity69 and @entity70 man has been a bit - part player this season having previously been a key man for the club he joined in the summer of 2011			2
speaking ahead of wednesday 's trip across @entity76 to play @entity25 , @entity0 said : ' @entity77 is very excited to play in the @entity40			1
he 's very excited and wants to get into the @entity64 squad for the @entity79			0
' @entity41 took @entity80 from @entity25 which left the door open for @entity77 to come in			0
tough test : @entity0 is preparing his west ham side to face @entity25 at @entity84 on wednesday ' he is fine to be selected as soon as possible but @entity5 needs a bit of time as he has n't played a game for six weeks			1
' @entity77 is your box - to - box midfield player and has the quality of finding space			0
playing at the top level in @entity64 brings a great deal of experience to go with the talent he has got			0
he is an intelligent footballer			0
' @entity5 , it is about getting him on the field and talking about nothing else other than scoring goals			0
we need somebody in that box to be productive and to start scoring , someone who only needs one or two chances			0
at the moment we are needing six or seven			0
' @entity1 sit third - bottom in the @entity40 while @entity25 are in third , just two points behind leaders @entity110			1
@entity0 said : ' @entity111 ( @entity112 ) has made @entity25 very difficult to break down again and that frees up their quality players to make an impact			2
but @entity116 should have beaten them earlier in the season , so if we play to our best we can get a good result			0
' on a roll : @entity25 warmed up for the @entity1 clash by beating @entity122 thanks to @entity124 's superb free - kick no chance : @entity127 in the @entity122 goal could not get near @entity124 's free - kick for @entity25 's winner			2

@entity0 signed @entity5 and @entity7 until the end of the season
@entity1 boss expected to go back in for @entity12 forward @entity14
*initial* bid for @entity14 was £ 3m rising to £ *4m* based on *appearances*
