@entity0 can fart up a storm next year and there 's nothing the federal government can do about it , judging from a line in the $ 1.1 trillion federal budget soon to land on president @entity8 's desk			0
the idea of tying the hands of the @entity11 , which has long planned to count livestock methane ' emissions ' as greenhouse gases for regulatory purposes , is just one of the legislative oddities – known in @entity18 as ' riders ' – that made the final cut			1
@entity22 also tut - tutted the @entity23 , siding with state laws legalizing medical marijuana and telling the feds they ca n't spend a dime to enforce an overriding national prohibition			1
and first lady @entity8 's vision of a healthier school lunch program took a hit , with the new law halting efforts to cut sodium levels in foods approved for lunch - lady distribution			1
@entity37 ? the federal government wants to regulate cow flatulence on global - warming grounds but farmers have won this round low - sodium : school lunch standards wo n't include a salt ceiling next year , despite first lady @entity8 's pledge to fight for every inch of ground on nutrition standards that move , backed by both food companies and school foodservice officials , will short - circuit a multi-year salt - cutting process that 's already in motion			1
a representative of a major multinational packaged food company told @entity57 that her employer does n't want to create a separate production chain just for school - food institutional customers			2
' if all our institutional customers – prisons , hospitals , and so forth – wanted low sodium standards , that would be different , ' she said , on the condition that her company 's name not be mentioned			0
' but at some point it becomes cost - prohibitive to be in the business if there are new contract requirements popping up all the time			0
' food officials and nutritionists in dozens of major markets have complained in recent years about changes to the federal school lunch program , driven largely by mrs. @entity8 , that depressed sales as students opted not to buy anything on the menu			0
in addition to a clampdown on low - salt rules until more science emerges about any health benefits , they will also get a pass on rules requiring the use of whole - grain breads and pastas if they can show buying the more expensive staples would create a financial hardship			2
one whole - grain option – pizza – would even take a hit if the @entity8 administration 's sodium goals were put on autopilot , warns the @entity105			0
mixed bag : medical pot in @entity18 will be a dead issue in 2015 but the feds wo n't be able to go after @entity110 who take advantage of state laws permitting it ' naturally occurring sodium present in milk , meats and other foods , make the later sodium targets extremely difficult to achieve , ' the organization says in a set of talking points obtained by @entity57			1
' popular and healthy choices such as low - fat , whole grain cheese pizza , macaroni and cheese and deli sandwiches could be stripped from school menus if manufacturers are unable to develop cheeses that meet these extreme standards			2
' getting that cheese to market , along with the rest of what a cow produces , will also be less difficult in 2015 – at least compared with what the @entity11 had planned			2
the agency had planned to fight global warming with a rule requiring farmers and ranchers to report how much methane their livestock produce through belching and flatulence			0
that was expected to increase the cost of bringing animal protein to market when the @entity11 followed up with a permitting process designed to shrink a cow 's carbon footprint			0
ranchers and environmentalists have fought a pitched battle over climate change rules since 2009 when a @entity159 report , ' @entity157 , ' claimed that farm animals were responsible globally for a whopping 18 per cent of all greenhouse gases			0
but in @entity110 , the @entity11 's own numbers showed months earlier that all of agriculture put together only contributed 6 per cent of the @entity110 total – and livestock agriculture 's portion came to just 2.6 per cent			1
in another sector of @entity110 agriculture , the burgeoning marijuana cultivation industry , @entity22 delivered a mixed bag over the weekend			1
the @entity23 will be forbidden in 2015 from spending any funds to enforce federal pot laws against people taking advantage of state laws that permit the medicinal use of the drug			2
but although a 65 - percent majority of @entity18 voters chose to create a medical marijuana program last month , that idea will die on the vine			1
the federal budget bill forbids spending money ' to enact or carry out any law , rule , or regulation to legalize or otherwise reduce penalties associated with the possession , use , or distribution ' of marijuana or anything made from it .			0

11th hour *sleight* - of - hand will prohibit the @entity11 from penalizing farmers for methane gas *emitted* by cows
the feds will be prohibited from going after @entity110 who benefit from state - level medical marijuana laws , even though pot is still *illegal* federally
school lunches will be safe from the salt police , with @entity22 clamping down on efforts to bland - i - *fy* *mystery* meat and *vegetable* *medleys*
a host of other ' riders ' were slipped into the ' @entity214 ' bill that had *members* of @entity22 *scrambling* to avoid a government *shutdown*
