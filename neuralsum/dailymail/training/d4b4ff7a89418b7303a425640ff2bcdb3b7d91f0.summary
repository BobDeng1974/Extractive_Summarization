by @entity0 published : 00:51 est , 26 may 2013 updated : 01:33 est , 26 may 2013 some call it wishful thinking , but president @entity4 has all but declared an end to the global war on @entity7 is not claiming final victory over extremists who still seek to kill @entity10 and other @entity11			1
instead , he is refocusing the long struggle against terrorism that lies ahead , steering the @entity10 away from what he calls an equally frightening threat - a country in a state of perpetual war			2
in doing so , @entity4 recasts the image of the terrorists themselves , from enemy warriors to cowardly thugs and resets the relationship between the @entity10 and @entity26 speech thursday was designed to move @entity10 's mindset away from a war footing and refine and recalibrate his own counterterrorism strategy			1
@entity4 asserted that @entity31 is ' on the path to defeat , ' reducing the scale of terrorism to pre- sept. 11 levels			1
that means that with the @entity39 war winding down , @entity4 is unlikely to commit troops in large numbers to any conflict - in @entity43 or other countries struggling with instability in the uncertain aftermath of the @entity47 - unless , as his critics fear , he tragically has underestimated @entity31 's staying power			1
' over ' : president @entity4 thursday declared the war on terror to be ' over ' - much to the chagrin of @entity54 in @entity55 ' wishing the defeat of terrorists does not make it so , ' said rep. @entity59 , a @entity60 @entity54 who is vice chairman of the @entity61 and a member of the @entity64 's view , @entity4 is pushing the idea that ' we can simply declare @entity31 beaten and go back to the pre- 9/11 era			1
' from the beginning of his presidency , @entity4 's centerpiece of his national security strategy has been a desire to move beyond the wars he inherited in @entity74 and @entity39 , as well as in the shadowy spaces occupied by @entity31 and its offshoots now creeping up in @entity77 and elsewhere			1
' too often , this president has sought to end combat operations through rhetoric rather than reality , ' @entity54 rep. @entity78 of @entity79 , chairman of the @entity61 , said friday			1
' he has declared the war in @entity74 over , but the insurgency there continues			0
he has declared an end to combat operations in @entity39 , but the @entity89 fight on			0
he has now declared the war on terrorism over , despite a terrorist attack in @entity93 this week , a terrorist attack in @entity95 last month and a terrorist attack in @entity97 that left a @entity10 ambassador and three other @entity10 dead last year			2
' yet the president cautioned against a return to what he called a complacency in counterterrorism before @entity105 extremists hijacked @entity10 jetliners and slammed them into the @entity107 and the @entity108			0
' make no mistake , ' he said , ' our nation is still threatened by terrorists , ' noting that the deadly attacks in @entity114 , @entity97 , last september and in @entity95 last month were tragic reminders			1
' we can not use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root ' but he also left little doubt that he thinks it is time to turn the page on the post- 9/11 approach			0
he was referring not only to the controversial use of armed drones to target terrorists in @entity126 , @entity39 and other countries , but also the commitment of tens of thousands of @entity10 ground troops in conventional fighting			2
' for all the focus on the use of force , force alone can not make us safe , ' he said			2
' we can not use force everywhere that a radical ideology takes root , ' adding that ' a perpetual war - through drones or @entity140 or troop deployments - will prove self - defeating and alter our country in troubling way			0
' some counterterrorism experts long have argued that the global war on terror should be brought to a close , and that some of the policies and programs put in place after 9/11 should be reconsidered and possibly @entity151 , a national security expert at the @entity152 , argues for a more traditional approach to battling terrorism , largely through law enforcement and the intelligence @entity157 said that ending the fight against terrorism will help reinforce the administration 's message that @entity10 is not at war with @entity105			2
' it helps , because it delegitimizes the terrorists , ' said @entity151			2
' they want to think of themselves as warriors			0
we want the world to think of them as crooks			0
we want everyone in every country not to think of them as terrorists defending @entity105 , but as people who are psychos			0
they are criminals , and that 's what we want to paint them as			0
' the ' end ' : @entity54 in @entity55 tend to disagree that is closely in line with @entity4 's description of what remains of the terrorist @entity184 said core @entity31 , the organization formerly led by @entity186 , is ' a shell of its former self			1
' the president said that while one of its most troublesome affiliates , @entity191 , is a force to be reckoned with , ' in the years to come , not every collection of thugs that labels themselves @entity31 will pose a credible threat to the @entity10			1
' he also cautioned against the threat of homegrown extremists and said terrorism may never go away entirely			0
' but as we shape our response , we have to recognize that the scale of this threat closely resembles the types of attacks we faced before 9/11 , ' he said .			0

@entity4 says @entity31 is ' on the path to defeat , ' reducing the scale of terrorism to pre- sept. 11 levels .
' wishing the defeat of terrorists does not make it so , ' said rep. @entity59 , a @entity60 @entity54
