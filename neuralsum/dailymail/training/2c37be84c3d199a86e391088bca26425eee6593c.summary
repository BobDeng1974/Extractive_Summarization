by @entity0 published : 10:49 est , 21 february 2013 updated : 11:11 est , 21 february 2013 a man whose ribcage was crushing his heart and lungs has been saved after doctors slotted a metal bar through his insides - to fashion a bizarre ‘ ribcage brace ’			1
@entity9 , 25 , was born with the unusual @entity10 excavatum - a @entity12 term meaning hollowed chest			1
but ingenious doctors managed to create a ‘ brace ’ for his ribcage - a foot - long metal bar , which holds his bones in place , protecting his heart and lungs			1
@entity9 's ribcage was growing inwards , slowly crushing his heart and lungs			1
doctors used a foot - long metal bar to hold the bones in place and three years after having the bar put in place , doctors are now confident that it can now be removed , and @entity9 ’s ribcage will remain normal			1
pub worker @entity9 , from @entity30 , @entity31 , said : ' i ’ll be really pleased to finally get the bar out , as it can be a bit uncomfortable			1
' it protrudes out of my ribcage a bit too , which looks a bit weird - but it has saved my life			2
' my mates are always joking that they ’re going to sell me off as scrap metal - i do n’t know how much they ’d get for me though			2
' the condition , known as @entity10 excavatum - a @entity12 term for hollowed chest - left him struggling to breathe although @entity9 was born with the condition , it did n't develop until his early teens			1
after struggling to understand why he was constantly struggling to breathe , @entity9 tapped his symptoms into @entity50 - and diagnosed himself with the unusual condition			1
he added : ' i went to my gp and showed him what i ’d found on the internet			0
i expected him to tell me off for looking up symptoms online and trying to diagnose myself , but instead he sent me to a chest expert			0
@entity9 has now been told that he can have the rod removed and is waiting for an operation date ' i had a scan at @entity60 , in @entity61 , and they said that my chest was very closed in , and if i was n’t treated , it would crush my heart			1
' they told me they would insert a metal rod into my chest to try and separate my ribs , and force them to grow normally			2
' it sounded a bit weird , but it was certainly worth it			0
' three and a half years after his original operation , in summer 2010 , @entity9 has now been told that he can have the rod removed			2
but he has been let down after the operation was cancelled four times - once when he was in his surgical gown			0
despite the situation , he refuses to criticise staff on wards			0
' the staff - the nurses - are brilliant , ' he said			0
' it seems to be a time management issue			0
' the nurses have always been polite and helpful and happy to assist ... then they have to deliver the bad news			0
' dr @entity88 , @entity60 ’ medical director , said : ' we are extremely sorry that mr @entity9 ’s operation has had to be rescheduled several times as this is certainly not what we would want for our patients			0
unfortunately , our hospitals currently remain under extreme pressure due to the high number of emergency admissions			0

@entity9 , 25 , had condition which caused his ribcage to grow inwards
meant his heart and lungs were being crushed , causing breathing *problems*
doctors created a ‘ brace - a foot - long metal bar - to holds his ribs in place
