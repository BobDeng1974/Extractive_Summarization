a beach walker has unearthed a 7ft fossil of a fierce marine monster in south @entity3			2
@entity4 , 34 , stumbled upon the complete 200 million - year - old ichthyosaur remains while walking along the @entity7 shoreline			1
the computer programmer and his brother spent a full day digging up the 132lb ( 60kg ) fossil , which mr @entity4 described as ' a whopper '			1
@entity22 , also known as fish lizards - despite being neither fish nor lizards - were reptiles that swam the world 's oceans in the @entity30 period while dinosaurs walked the land			1
they died out around 25 million years before the extinction event that wiped out the dinosaurs and were replaced by plesiosaurs , a long neck marine reptile ' it was a particularly low tide and we were just leaving after failing to find anything interesting , ' said mr @entity4			1
now mr @entity4 has replaced the coffee table in his home with the fossil of the carnivorous icthyosaur to show off his find to friends and family			2
