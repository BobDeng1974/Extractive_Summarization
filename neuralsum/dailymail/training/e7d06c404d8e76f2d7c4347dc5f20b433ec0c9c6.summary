by @entity0 published : 09:17 est , 4 november 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 4 november 2013 a stage 4 cancer sufferer has written a powerful op - ed explaining that as a direct result of @entity5 she has lost her life - saving medical insurance and the team that has kept her alive			1
@entity8 , who has been battling gallbladder cancer since 2007 , explained in a piece for the @entity11 that she is ' one of the losers ' in the president 's signature healthcare plan			1
' i am a determined fighter and extremely lucky , ' she writes			0
' but this luck may have just run out : my affordable , lifesaving medical insurance policy has been canceled effective december 31			0
' since learning that her plan with @entity20 will end within weeks , she has been scrambling to find out the alternatives for her care , she writes			0
battle : cancer sufferer @entity24 ( pictured with her husband @entity26 ) says she is ' one of the losers ' from @entity5 as she has lost her healthcare plan and now faces losing her doctors too but she has learned that she must now either accept the government exchange plan and lose her world - class doctors or pay more for private insurance with an unfamiliar company			1
it means that after fighting the cancer , which has a five - year survival rate of just two per cent , for nearly seven years , she faces the prospect of losing her team of primary doctors and oncologists , who have been crucial to saving her life			2
she explains that her insurance company has paid $ 1.2 million for her treatment and has never doubted her doctors , but now it is pulling out of the individual @entity45 market			2
there is no one health - exchange plan accepted by both of the medical centers she has come to rely on ; it means she needs to choose between either keeping her primary oncologist at @entity51 or her primary care doctors at the @entity53			2
few options : @entity8 ( taking part in an 800 - mile walk after she was previously cancer - free ) must either accept the government plan and lose her doctors or pay more with an unfamilar insurance company world - class care : @entity53 ( pictured ) , where her primary care doctors are based , does not accept the same exchange plan as @entity51 , where her primary oncologist is based ' my choice is to get coverage through the government health exchange and lose access to my cancer doctors , ' she writes , ' or pay much more for insurance outside the exchange ( the quotes average 40 % to 50 % more ) for the privilege of starting over with an unfamiliar insurance company and impaired benefits			1
' with time running out , @entity8 says that she and her broker ' still do n't have a clue how to best proceed '			0
she asks : ' what happened to the president 's promise , " you can keep your health plan " ? or to the promise that " you can keep your doctor " ? ' ' thanks to the law , i have been forced to give up a world - class health plan			1
the exchange would force me to give up a world - class physician			0
' she concludes that while taking away an individual 's control over their medical coverage may be an effective way to manage costs , it makes it harder for them to stay alive			0
' @entity105 promises ' : @entity106 has previously said that people will not lose their healthcare plans or their doctors - but @entity8 said that is not the case for her and demands to know why ' perhaps that 's the point , ' she writes			1
while the piece appears aimed at president @entity106 , she writes that she only wants to stay alive , rather than made political points			2
her op - ed comes among increasing concerns that exchange plans following @entity5 will typically have narrow networks of physicians and hospitals			1
it is just the latest criticism of the system ; the enrollment process has also been plagued by software and data entry problems which led @entity129 secretary @entity128 to offer an apology to a @entity131 in testimony			0
@entity128 called the enrollment software problems a ' debacle ' and ' a miserably frustrating experience for way too many @entity137			0

@entity8 , who has been battling gallbladder cancer for nearly 7 years , wrote about how @entity106 's plan has *affected* her care in op - ed
following the law , her *current* healthcare plan will be canceled next month
she must now either accept the government plan and lose her doctors - as there is no single plan covering them all *â€“* or pay more for private insurance with an unfamiliar company
president had promised that people were not going to lose their healthcare or their doctors - ' what happened to the president 's promises ? ' she asks
