by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 04:55 est , 3 december 2013 updated : 06:48 est , 3 december 2013 the government should tell people to use electric blankets to stay warm this winter , a former @entity3 frontbencher has suggested			1
@entity7 urged ministers to launch a campaign extolling the benefits of electric blankets as ‘ the answer to many of the government ’s aims ’			1
she argued they are green , use little electricity and help to make homes for efficient			2
warmth : ministers should launch a campaign telling people to use electric blankets , a former government frontbencher has suggested it follows @entity26 advising people to wear jumpers if they get cold , before later insisting it would not tell people how to stay warm			1
the government yesterday revealed plans to cut green levies by £ 50 on the average bill to counter claims it was failing to act on soaring costs			1
the @entity37 energy firms have agreed to pass on the reduction or freeze bills until 20915 , provided wholesale costs do not rise			1
but there are still warnings that with average bills still more than £ 1,400 , many people will be forced to choose between heating and eating			2
@entity7 , a former @entity3 mep and government whip , said electric blankets are green and efficient responding to the government ’s announcement on bills , @entity7 said she backed measures to make homes more efficient			1
but she added : ‘ have the government considered , as a simple , practical measure , encouraging people to use electric blankets ? ’ @entity7 , a former mep and government whip , added : ‘ they are the answer to many of the government ’s aims			1
they are very green as they use little electricity and they reduce the need for so much heating in the home			2
‘ they also make the home very energy efficient - that is , they cost less - which is what the government seem to have as an aim			1
’ however , ministers are nervous of doing anything that risks looking like they are telling people how to avoid the cold			0
energy minister @entity83 sidestepped the question on electric blankets , telling the @entity86 : ‘ as with all measures , we need to be able to ensure that people are kept warm and safe and that they are not paying over the odds for energy			1
‘ there are measures in the statement and measures that we are already undertaking that will help energy efficiency and help consumers to reduce their bills			2
’ energy bills will still be higher than last winter , even after the government agreed cuts to controversial green levies which will save customers £ 50			1
most of the @entity37 had already announced rise of more than £ 100 this winter , before ministers moved to reduce the impact of government schemes designed to help the poor and vulnerable insulate their homes			1
yesterday @entity112 said it will cut bills by £ 53 in january , @entity111 bills will fall by £ 50 , while @entity114 said it would hold prices until 2015 , but ministers admitted prices could still rise again			1
checking the bill : details of handouts of up to £ 1,000 for homeowners to spend on energy - saving measures have been revealed ( file picture ) the government is cutting the cost of the energy company obligation ( @entity126 ) , an insulation scheme delivered by major energy suppliers , in a move that should shave £ 30 - £ 35 off bills , on average , next year			1
the @entity131 also announced it is establishing a rebate , saving the average customer £ 12 on their bill for the next two years			0
electricity companies will also take voluntary action to reduce network costs in 2014 - 15 , funding a one - off reduction of around £ 5 on electricity bills			1
in addition , energy firms will be given two years longer to hit targets on the insulation of homes , enabling costs to consumers to be spread out			2
wrapped up : @entity26 denied that @entity148 was urging people to wear a jumper it is notoriously difficult for a politician to tell people how to do something as simple as keeping warm			0
the risk is that even stating the obvious like putting on an extra layer leaves ministers , especially wealthy ones , of being out of touch			0
in october a @entity26 spokesman said people struggling to pay soaring heating bills should ' consider ' putting on a jumper			0
after @entity163 leader @entity162 accused @entity148 of changing policy ' from " hug a hoodie " to " wear a hoodie " , @entity167 rowed back			0
a spokesman said it was ' entirely false to suggest the @entity170 would advise people they should wear jumpers to stay warm '			0
energy secretary @entity172 also admitted he did not know what temperature is own thermostat is set at at home because ' my wife tends to take care of that '			0
but he went on : ' i am sure people wear jumpers			0
i wear jumpers at home			0
' @entity183 , deputy chairman of the @entity3 party , produced an energy - saving guide for constituents telling them to shut their curtains			0
in the 28 - page guide , the @entity189 and @entity190 mp said : ' close your curtains : as the days grow shorter as winter approaches , closing your curtains at dusk helps to stop heat escaping through windows			0
' this is a simple and free way of reducing wasted energy and your energy bills			2
' and just yesterday a power boss sparked uproar by saying the amount of electricity families in @entity207 use is a ‘ luxury ’			0
the extraordinary claim by @entity210 , a senior director of the @entity211 , coincided with energy companies refusing to rule out more price rises			2
mr @entity210 warned that providing ‘ the luxury of electricity that we desire ’ would mean customers paying billions more to upgrade the power network .			0
