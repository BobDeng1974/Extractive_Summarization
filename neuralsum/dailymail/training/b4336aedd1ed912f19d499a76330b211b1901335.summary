by @entity0 for @entity1 when @entity3 , now four , from @entity4 , was born , her mother @entity2 , 35 , just had enough time to glimpse a pair of eyes and a tiny nose before her new daughter was whisked away by nurses			1
by the time she next saw her daughter , she was in the midst of a tangle of wires as doctors frantically tried to work out what was wrong with the tiny baby and find a solution for her continual vomiting			1
but more than four years on , @entity2 and the doctors are no wiser and while they have managed to fix @entity3 's heart problems , precisely what sort of genetic disorder she suffers from remains unknown			1
rare : @entity2 with her little daughter @entity3 who has a genetic disorder so rare , it does n't even have a name enjoying life : despite her condition , @entity3 has learned to walk with the aid of a walking frame ' it was like a punch in the stomach because we 'd been given the all - clear from the amnio test , ' says @entity2 of the moment she discovered that her tiny baby was n't the healthy daughter she had hoped for			1
' the pregnancy had been tortuous but we just thought she was going to be a very small baby			0
we were in the recovery room and laughing and joking when the doctor came in			0
' the way the news was delivered to us … he walked into the room with a nurse and delivered it so abruptly - even the nurse was shocked			2
' convinced @entity3 would n't survive , doctors tried to prepare a devastated @entity2 and her husband @entity56 for the worst but , much to the surprise of medics , the little girl clung on			1
initially , the biggest challenge was working out how to feed her : with @entity3 unable to suck and prone to vomiting whenever she was given milk			1
' she was poorly and it turned out that every time they fed her , they were drowning her because the milk was going straight to the chest , straight to the lungs , ' remembers @entity2			1
' it was a good four months before we got her home and she has spent pretty much the first three years of her life were in hospital			2
this summer is the first that she has n’t been in and out all the time			0
' despite her improving condition , @entity3 who suffers from microcephaly [ an unusually small skull ] in addition to the genetic disorder , is still unable to walk unaided , talk or feed herself			1
she also continues to vomit uncontrollably , which means she regularly suffers from chest infections and needs a special bed , a feeding pump and round - the - clock care from her mother who has been forced to give up a promising career to care for her			1
' she still vomits and i never know quite how much food to give her or whether her body is going to tolerate that feed , ' explains @entity2			1
family : @entity3 with her big brother @entity92 , seven , who has also learned to live with his sister 's genetic disorder tough : @entity3 requires round - the - clock care which means @entity2 has been unable to return to work limited : because @entity3 's condition is so rare , no one knows how long she will live - doctors estimated five ' it 's easier now we 've got the feeding pump but before , with gravity feeding , i would be there for an hour and i could n’t leave her , not to go to the toilet , to answer the door or for anything			1
' then , you ’d have to do it all over again			0
i was a proper prisoner in my own home			0
now with the pump , i programme it to put the food in over an hour , although we still have to have vomit jugs around the house			2
' @entity3 's condition has also had a huge impact on her older brother @entity92 , seven , who , says @entity2 , has had to see things that a child should never have to			1
more difficult to deal with is the lack of facts			1
not only do @entity2 and husband @entity56 have no idea what exactly is wrong with their daughter , they have no idea of what the future for @entity3 will look like			1
although doctors originally put her life expectancy at between three and five years , @entity2 hopes that @entity3 will live longer			1
' the prognosis has always been " we do n't know " , ' she says , sadly			0
' @entity3 has microcephaly and that combined with her chest infections has cut her life down a lot			1
' she ’s having fewer and fewer chest infections which is good but if her skull stops growing , then that 's where we know that we wo n't have much time left with her			2
we 're just ticking along at the minute			0
' not that she has any regrets about learning to love her daughter which she admits , in a bid to protect herself , she tried hard not to do at first			2
' i did try not to fall in love with her [ at first ] because i thought we were going to lose her , ' she confesses			0
' i never thought we 'd bring her home			0
it did take me a long time to let myself go and fall head over heels with her			0
i was trying to prepare myself to let her go , sort of protecting myself			0
' difficult though @entity3 's first four years have been , @entity2 bubbles over with love for her daughter but says that she would have liked more help			1
' no , i do n't think we 've had enough help , ' she says			0
' i want to return to work			2
i had to give up a career			0
i spent four years in higher education and i 'm in debt with my student loan because i ca n’t pay it off			0
@entity169 : although no one knows how long @entity3 has , @entity2 says she is grateful to have been able to know her ' instead , i work 24 - hours a day caring for @entity3			1
there is no rest from that			0
i get eight hours a week support but finding respite care at the right time such as on the school run is hard because they have families of their own			2
' it can be a nightmare on the school run if @entity3 's being sick and i have to get to school to pick up @entity92 ... those are the times when i would like some help			1
' she also says she has been less than impressed with the local council who , after refusing to pay for a specialist bed , offered to pay for a crash mat to place beside a regular one instead			0
' she 's on a feeding pump which is a long tangled wire , ' explains @entity2			1
' she ’d fall out , trip over the wire , get tangled up or bump into the wardrobe which could then fall down on her			0
' in the end , the @entity196 charity provided the bed that she 's got			2
we are so very grateful to them for doing that			0
' but you feel like you 're constantly begging for help and it 's demoralising			2
i do n't want to be in this situation and begging for help			0
i ’m just trying to join in with life - everything is a bit hard to be honest			2
' despite the challenges and uncertainty of life with @entity3 , @entity2 is doing her best to be as positive as she can			1
' you do n't know how long you 've got with anybody do you ? ' she says			0
it 's hard knowing that @entity56 wo n't be walking her down the aisle , that we ’ll never go and get our hair done together or talk about boyfriends - that hurts			2
' but i 'm grateful that i 've had the opportunity to get to know her			0
