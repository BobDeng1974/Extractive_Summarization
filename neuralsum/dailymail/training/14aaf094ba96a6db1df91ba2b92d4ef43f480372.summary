@entity0 admitted a week of distractions had taken their toll after he suffered a nightmare start to the @entity4			1
the world number one came into the first leg of the four - tournament @entity8 play - offs as a hot favourite following victories at the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , but starting on the back nine at the @entity15 , he made the turn in four - over 40 before picking up a shot on the way back			1
his round of 74 left him nine shots off the lead held by @entity22 , who made an eagle on the 17th for a round of 65 that put him one shot clear of a group of eight on five under			1
@entity0 was within an inch or so of a birdie on the first hole he played , the 10th , but his form then deserted him as he registered a double - bogey on the 12th , and followed that with bogeys on the 13th and 18th to leave him last of all players on the course at the time			1
he pulled a shot back on the par - four fifth but gave it back on the eighth , missing a four - foot putt to bogey			2
he recovered to birdie the ninth , his final hole of the day , finishing with a three - over round of 74 and at least off the very bottom of the leaderboard			1
@entity0 , who appeared on late - night @entity66 television with @entity29 earlier this week , days after parading his @entity67 at @entity70 's @entity69 ground last weekend , said he needed to regain his focus to get back into contention			2
' i 'm not quite on my game , i 've not quite put in the time over the last few days for obvious reasons , ' he said on @entity77			0
' i 'm going to go and have some lunch and then work on the range , work on a few things , and try to catch up on some practice i 've missed out on over the last week and try to be ready for tomorrow			0
' looking forward to the @entity8 , he added : ' for me , not being here for the weekend is n't an option			0
i 've got to work hard today on the range and get out there and get off to a fast start tomorrow , and get myself back into this tournament			2
' @entity90 carded 68 , dropping shots on the 12th and 17th to miss out on a share of the lead			0
' my game feels close , ' he said on @entity77			0
' i played really well at the @entity14 as well but my putter let me down so i was really pleased today that there were some four , five putts that i got and that kept my momentum going			1
it was something i struggled with at the @entity14			1
' my ball striking was there or thereabouts			0
i did n't hit that many fairways today so i was happy to get round			2
' frustrated : @entity0 reacts to hitting into a sand trap on the 13th hole at the @entity4 in @entity107 @entity22 , having just birdied the 16th , chipped in from 47 foot on the 17th for an eagle which catapulted him clear of the chasing pack			1
having arrived here ranked down at 104th in the @entity112 rankings , @entity22 said he was able to play with a freedom not usually afforded him at this time of year			0
' i had very expectations but i was happy with how i was playing , ' he said			0
' i 've come to this tournament before where i was in the top 30 and i felt like i had something to lose , but anything here is house money for me			0
' the top 125 players in the standings have qualified for the @entity4 , with the field being trimmed to 100 for the @entity124 , 70 for the @entity125 and then 30 for the @entity126 with the man finishing top of the standings claiming a 10million @entity66 dollars bonus			1
@entity0 led the @entity8 standings coming into the tournament followed by @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 and @entity136 .			0

@entity38 is looking for a fourth *straight* win following *success* at the @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14
however that is in *jeopardy* after a poor start at the @entity4
@entity146 number one picked up his form towards the end of the round
