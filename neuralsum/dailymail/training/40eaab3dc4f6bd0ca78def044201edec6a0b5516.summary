it was an expletive uttered by his new team - mate @entity1 that initially made @entity4 aware that another kind of life was possible away from the suffocating madness of @entity8			1
@entity1 , used to being in the public eye as a @entity12 @entity11 winner and @entity14 legend , had n't been at the @entity15 long before realising the levels of adulation and pressure in @entity19 were on a totally different scale to anywhere else			1
' when @entity1 came , after 10 days he was like : " f * * * " ' recalls @entity4 , whose move from @entity24 to @entity25 in the summer transfer window has been one of the most eye - catching transfers of 2014			1
at @entity8 , there are five thousand people at training every day , television crews filming you every day			2
' furthermore , @entity1 assured his young colleague that in @entity32 , supporters did n't grab at you in the street or travel miles to wait outside your house in the hope of catching a glimpse			1
for @entity4 , who found it hard to cope with the huge expectations placed on him after eclipsing @entity56 as the youngest goalscorer in @entity8 's history aged 17 years , 54 days , the exchanges with @entity1 were illuminating			1
it sowed a seed that maybe there was a future , a more pleasant future , in @entity32			2
and while he could not have foreseen then that his journey would one day lead to @entity25 , a place better - known around the world for pottery than football , he has no regrets			1
' i love the passion at @entity8 , i have grown up in a @entity76 country after all , but i like it better here			2
in @entity79 , people do not respect the players , the same as in @entity82 , ' he says			0
@entity4 found it hard to cope with the expectations placed on him after eclipsing @entity56 as the youngest goalscorer in @entity8 's history aged 17 years and 54 days @entity4 burst on to the scene and reminded fans of @entity56 , which may have worked against him ' in @entity32 it looks like a different world , the people admire the players but also respect them			1
here is better , more tranquil			0
' to outsiders , the transfer of a one - time boy wonder to @entity25 appears strange			1
four years ago this weekend , he was involved in @entity99 when @entity8 thrashed @entity101 's @entity100 5 - 0 in what was hailed as the greatest club performance of all - time			1
this saturday , he will instead be sharpening his boots for the visit of @entity106 at the @entity107			0
but scratch the surface and it does make more sense for the 24 - year - old to have changed direction in his career as sharply as he turns defenders on the pitch			1
the son of a @entity117 footballer whose own career ended in @entity79 , @entity4 was inducted into @entity8 's world - famous academy at the age of nine			1
the 24 - year - old was inducted into @entity8 's world - famous academy at the age of nine his quicksilver feet reminded everyone of @entity56 – no pressure there , then – and he scored 900 goals at youth level before making his first - team debut at a younger age than the @entity133 genius			1
comparisons between them reached fever pitch			0
i thought i did n't feel pressure but when i look back now , i can see it is difficult for a 17 - year - old boy to get by and deal with the whole situation , ' admits @entity4			1
' everything changed for me overnight			0
a lot of my friends would still be at school and if i tried to go out with them , it would suddenly be very complicated			0
@entity4 is closed down by @entity147 of @entity148 during the @entity150 match in september the @entity25 forward ( left ) drags the ball back and leaves @entity153 ' @entity152 heading for the hot dog stall ' fans would run up to me if i 'd go through the streets , my family lived in a village rather than the city but supporters would still come to my house			1
one newspaper portrayed me as a superhero			0
' i lost some of my childhood and that is one of the things i am most sensitive about and touched me the most			0
i am a family person but there were many moments i did n't have n't the chance to enjoy with them , even though i know football has given me other things			0
' @entity4 makes it clear he is not looking for sympathy or putting out a sob - story			1
but it 's true that everyone is hard - wired differently and while @entity56 , @entity180 and @entity181 coped with being in the spotlight , the softly - spoken @entity4 found it difficult			1
- makes his @entity8 debut in a 0 - 0 draw away to @entity186 in september 2007 less than three weeks after his 17th birthday			1
- takes @entity56 's record as the youngest scorer in @entity8 history with a clever right - foot finish against @entity192 at the @entity15 , aged 17 years , 54 days			1
- replaces @entity193 for his @entity79 debut at 18 in @entity11 qualifier against @entity196			2
it remains his only @entity79 cap but he has played seven times for @entity19			0
- scores a wonder goal from @entity181 's pass in a 4 - 1 @entity8 win against @entity192			1
@entity4 put the ball to the defender 's left while he ran around the other side before finishing in the corner - sets up the final goal for @entity208 in the best @entity8 performance ever , a 5 - 0 victory over @entity101 's @entity100 in @entity99 of november 2010			1
- shows @entity25 fans what he can do with an outstanding solo strike at @entity153 in their last @entity150 match , picking the ball up from near the halfway line and finishing with a 25 - yard drive @entity4 ( centre ) runs off in celebration after scoring his first @entity25 goal against @entity153 @entity221 congratulated by team - mate @entity222 after his goal at @entity224 ' i grew up at @entity8 in one of the golden ages with the best players in the world			1
every day we learned with the ball , and that was critical			0
' but when you play with a big club , you need to get results every single day , even more when you come from the house ( homegrown )			0
' @entity238 was my first coach in the first - team and i played well and scored			2
in my second year , they changed the trainers ( to @entity242 ) and the chances and opportunities were different			0
' @entity238 adored @entity4 but under the more intense and demanding @entity242 , the little forward was gradually reduced to the role of bit - part player			2
there were dark rumours in @entity19 that @entity4 felt he was picked on			2
it 's not something he expands on during this interview but his words do indicate he was an unhappy footballer , eventually leaving on loan to @entity255 , @entity256 and @entity257 between 2011 and may 2014			0
@entity4 sealed a £ 3million move to @entity260 ' side and joined former @entity8 team - mate @entity261 ' as an only son , it was not easy for my parents to see all the things i was going through ( in @entity8 )			1
so eventually i took the decisions i took and i was convinced i was doing the right thing			0
' when @entity25 made an inquiry for the fallen idol last summer , their timing was perfect – and @entity4 remembered what @entity1 had told him about @entity32			1
encouraged that his former @entity8 team - mate @entity261 was already at @entity25 , he quickly said ' yes ' to manager @entity260 , a former striker at the @entity15 himself			1
after his problems with @entity242 , the relationship with @entity260 has been key			0
' i do n't like it when a coach puts up a big distance between himself and the players , ' explains @entity4			2
' he ( @entity260 ) is very close to us and that 's why i like him			0
@entity1 's words of wisdom about @entity32 helped @entity4 to make the decision ' i knew @entity25 was a historic club and when i learned @entity260 wanted me in this team , it was a great motivation			1
' off - the - field , he has settled in well , taking twice - weekly lessons to improve his already - passable @entity32 and knowing enough to use country roads from his @entity292 home to training each morning thereby avoiding the busy @entity294			2
football-wise , it 's been more of a slow burner with @entity260 asking for patience from @entity25 fans			2
but last weekend , @entity4 rolled back the years to score his first goal for the club against @entity153 following a brilliant solo run and low finish from 25 yards			2
it hints at plenty more to come			0
' the first few months have been important to improve my physical condition and get used to a new league			0
but anyone will tell you , the more you play , the better rhythm you find , ' he explains			0
@entity260 ' @entity25 side find themselves in ninth - place in the @entity150 with 15 points from 11 games ' i think i have played well in some games but people will say @entity153 was my best match because i scored and we won ! ' i do n't compare @entity25 to @entity8			1
not everybody can say that they have been at @entity8 , but i do n't think everyone can say , “ i am a professional footballer in the @entity150			2
” ' @entity32 football has changed in the last 10 years , it 's not so different now from @entity79			2
if a defender goes in hard , they will be booked or sent off			0
' some of the things i did early in my career might have been forgotten now			0
but i know how much it cost me and that is why i feel proud			0
and it gives me the strength to continue			0
i will work to improve every day			0
i am only 24 and there is plenty of football ahead			0
