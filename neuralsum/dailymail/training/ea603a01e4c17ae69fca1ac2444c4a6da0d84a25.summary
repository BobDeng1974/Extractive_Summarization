by @entity0 our ancestor ? the remains of two early humans dating back 7,000 years has proved that @entity6 people originally came from @entity7 the remains of two early humans dating back 7,000 years has proved that @entity6 people originally came from @entity7			1
the remains - found in a cave in @entity10 - included a near - complete skeleton			2
the prehistoric genetic fragments date back 7,000 years - 1,700 years before @entity13 , the @entity13 whose mummy was discovered in the @entity15			1
they are believed to be from an ancient population that continued to move northwards into territories such as @entity6 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
' they come from two individuals who lived in what is now @entity25 near @entity26 and share the same characteristics as that of people from @entity6 and other parts of northern @entity31			2
evolutionary biologist dr @entity32 , of the @entity33 , said : ‘ these hunters - gatherers shared nomadic habits and had a common origin			0
‘ despite their geographical distance , individuals from the regions corresponding to the current @entity6 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , and @entity7 , shared the same mitochondrial lineage			1
’ the site where the remains were found was only discovered in 2006 by chance			2
the cave is in a cold and mountainous area which is why the dna was preserved			0
but it is believed they continued to move northwards meaning that today ’s @entity7 do not have the same lineage			1
bones belonging to them were found in the @entity52 cave in @entity10			0
they included one skeleton that was almost complete			0
the prehistoric genetic fragments date back 7,000 years , - 1,700 years before @entity13 , the @entity13 whose mummy was discovered in the @entity15 the study published in @entity58 also shows modern day @entity60 populations do not come from the pair			1
dr @entity32 and colleagues managed to decipher from one the complete mitochondrial dna , which is passed down the maternal line , revealed @entity31 from this time were very uniform genetically			0
the overall dna data represents 1.34 and 0.5 percent of both individuals ’ total genome , and found @entity60 from then were more closely related to northern @entity31 who may have assimilated part of their genetic legacy			0
the mummy of @entity13 belonged to a man who lived 5,300 years ago , a period known geologically as the @entity74 , and was found in the @entity75 , on the border of @entity77 and @entity78			1
dr @entity79 said the team eventually hopes to recover the complete dna of the individuals , and to compare it with that of modern humans			0
he said : ‘ the arrival of the @entity74 brought about a replacement of populations , and could cause genetic changes in genes associated with new infectious diseases , and in metabolic genes linked to changes in diet			2
therefore , all the information extracted from this genome will be absolutely important			0

7,000 year old skeleton linked to populations in @entity6 , @entity19 , @entity21 and @entity20
older than @entity13 the *iceman* , whose mummy was found in the @entity15
ancient population moved northwards from @entity7
