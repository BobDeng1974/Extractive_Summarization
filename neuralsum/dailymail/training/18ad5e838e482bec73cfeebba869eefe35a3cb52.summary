the locals complain that they are being swamped by wealthy city dwellers buying second homes in their seaside enclave			1
but the buy - up looks likely to continue after @entity5 in @entity6 was voted the most sought - after place to live in @entity8			1
according to a poll by property website @entity12 , people believe @entity5 would be the most ideal location to reside in			1
@entity28 and @entity29 also scored highly , followed by @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32			0
@entity5 families say they can not buy homes in their community because outsiders have flooded the market and sent prices rocketing beyond their grasp			2
last month , locals called for all future new - build homes to be restricted to permanent residents only			1
the proposal was contained in a draft version of the @entity5 neighbourhood development plan , which they hope will be voted into local planning regulations next year			0
@entity48 , the town ’s @entity49 mp , said high numbers of holiday homes in @entity6 meant some areas became ‘ ghost communities ’ in the winter when holidaymakers returned to their main residence			2
he said : ‘ without a doubt , high numbers of second homes do have a detrimental impact on the opportunities for local families to buy			2
’ but while many dream of living by the sea , others simply want to live near a good pub. the @entity12 survey found that being within walking distance of a pub was more important than being near a park or supermarket when choosing where to live			0
if money was no object , people would choose a detached house with three bedrooms , one kitchen , two living rooms , two bathrooms , a garden and a utility room			0
@entity85 , a @entity12 analyst , said : ‘ while we gave people the chance to choose a home fit for royalty , on average they said they would be happy in a more modest home with plenty of space and practical features , instead of rattling around in a massive mansion			1
‘ this shows that the perfect home for many is one that they know they could possibly live in one day , depending on where they are looking to buy , rather than a pipe dream			0
’ idyllic : but @entity5 ' @entity49 mp said high numbers of second homes were having an impact on residents			0

seaside resort *topped* @entity8 poll by the property website @entity12
but locals are **n't** happy - as they ca **n't** afford to buy in their own town
they want a *law* only *allowing* permanent residents have homes built
