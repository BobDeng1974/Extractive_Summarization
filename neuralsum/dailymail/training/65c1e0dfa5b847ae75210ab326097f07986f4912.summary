@entity1 boss @entity0 was disappointed with referee @entity3 's decision to award the hosts their first - half penalty which changed the game , calling the decision a ' disgrace ' as @entity9 won 2 - 1 at the @entity10			1
with just over 10 minutes of the first half to go , @entity9 's @entity11 conceded a penalty by bringing down @entity14 and the @entity16 striker made no mistake as he slotted the ball past @entity19 into the bottom right corner			1
their lead did not last long as - nine minutes later - the @entity22 were awarded a penalty , with @entity24 challenging @entity25 , but it looked as if the @entity27 went down easily			1
@entity42 nodded his powerful header home from substitute @entity46 's cross as @entity9 went ahead for the first time deep into the second half and the @entity49 never found a way back despite some late pressure			1
on the two penalty decisions , @entity0 said : ' the first - it was a penalty , i 've watched it back			1
@entity11 i think it is that has his hands all over @entity14 and twists him around and knocks him , pulls @entity14 to the ground - so for me that 's a penalty			1
' the penalty against is a disgrace			0
it 's a disgraceful decision			2
not in a million years is it a penalty and the problem we 'll have with it now is a lot of games we 're having this season a match - changing decision is going against us constantly and i do n't see anything being done about it			2
' i 've spoke to the referees about it and the association about it and i do n't hear anything from ( referee chief ) @entity79 coming back to me at all , which i find poor leadership and the whole thing is becoming to mount up now which is becoming a very worrying situation			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 called the decisions a disgrace as his side failed to win again ' it 's happening a lot			1
we 're having a lot of decisions going against us			0
match - changing decsions and it 's a disgraceful decision because not in a million years - i looked straight at their bench and even they ( @entity9 ) could n't believe it			1
' he ( @entity25 ) should be punished for diving , it 's a clear dive which is cheating			2
he 's cheated the ref and then the ref 's cheated us for giving the decision that never was			2
' i just think it 's a poor , poor decision and it 's cost us at a vital time where we 're just coming up to half - time - we should have been coming in 1 - 0 up and it 's a different game then , a different game plan for us second half			1
' he added : ' we have talked about being clinical and coming to a place like this the chances would n't be flowing so the very good chances that we had should have been goals but unfortunately we could n't take them			0
' man of the match @entity32 was delighted as @entity9 returned to winning ways			0
he told @entity114 1 : ' i think it was ( well deserved )			0
once we got a grip on the game			0
@entity14 caused us a couple of problems during the game in the first half			2
@entity42 was clearly delighted with his impact as @entity9 held out against some late pressure from @entity1 ' there were too many balls going to his feet and he was able to turn and he and ( @entity127 ) have managed to link up really well this year and we noticed that in the video			1
and once we got to grips with that and in the end i thought we desreved the victory			0
' we stopped the ball getting to his feet ... when you 've got that and the movement they 've got with people like @entity127 and ( @entity142 ) @entity141 on one side and ( @entity145 ) @entity144 on the other it 's difficult to defend , and we had a tough time of it			0
' but once we got to grips with it we dominated the second part of the game and @entity42 came on and won it for us			0
' video it was a penalty - @entity153			0

@entity1 boss @entity0 was angry with referee @entity3 's decision
@entity25 went down in the area after @entity24 's *innocuous* tackle
this came after @entity11 brought down @entity14 in the *opposite* area , which @entity3 *contentiously* gave
@entity9 went on to win the game 2 - 1 at the @entity10
@entity1 are without a win in their last four @entity166 games
