by @entity0 in hiding : former @entity2 spy and intelligence leaker @entity1 is holed up in @entity4 @entity7 's ability to track terrorists and crime gangs has been severely damaged as a result of the intelligence leaks by ex- @entity2 spy @entity1 , the home secretary revealed yesterday			1
one year on from the whistleblower ’s actions , police and security services are finding it harder to monitor the electronic communications used by fanatics and master criminals , @entity13 warned			1
she said the issue must be addressed – raising the prospect of new laws to help @entity25 , police and others to intercept emails and phone calls			1
mrs may told the @entity31 : ‘ people talk about national security versus civil liberties , but you can only enjoy your liberty if you have security			1
’ @entity38 has been accused of compromising secret surveillance techniques by passing up to 1.7million stolen top secret documents to @entity41			0
it is estimated a quarter of the serious criminals being tracked by @entity25 have fallen off the radar following the leak – described by security officials as the biggest in modern history – because they have been alerted to the methods being used to track them			1
one senior intelligence source said the @entity7 ’s electronic eavesdropping centre had also suffered a ‘ sizeable reduction ’ in its ability to gather intelligence on terrorists			0
ministers have also been hit by a @entity59 ruling which means that internet and communications companies can no longer be forced to store data such as phone records			2
this information is vital to police and intelligence agencies in establishing who a suspect has made contact with and when			0
mrs may suggested there was a need for a charm offensive to repair the damage done by @entity1 ’s claims that there is mass surveillance of the public			1
‘ there is a need to get out there more generally the importance of intelligence in fighting all of these national security threats , ’ she said			0
‘ we will try to find innovative ways of getting the importance of these activities to members of the public			0
’ mrs may has previously run into political trouble by promoting plans for a so - called snoopers ’ charter , which would allow the police and security services to access every internet click as well as phone calls and emails			2
the last proposal was scuppered when @entity100 withdrew @entity102 support			0
warning : the issue was raised by home secretary @entity13 in a speech at the @entity31 today ( pictured ) but @entity106 sources stress the current issue is about protecting the capabilities the police and security services already have to monitor electronic communications , not giving them extra powers			1
sir @entity111 , a former director of @entity25 , has said the disclosures by @entity1 , who is holed up in @entity4 , had led to some of @entity25 ’s operations being shut down			1
he said : ‘ there is no doubt in my mind that substantial damage to @entity7 security has been caused by the @entity1 revelations ... i think it inevitable that many of those who have something to hide will have ... changed their communication methods as a result			2
’ @entity128 deputy director @entity127 has said the stolen files contained ‘ the keys to the kingdom ’ and @entity131 director general @entity130 called @entity1 ’s actions a ‘ gift to terrorists ’			2
@entity1 claims the @entity2 government ’s actions were a ‘ threat to democracy ’			2
much of the stolen information was revealed by @entity41 and the @entity142			0
but there are mounting suspicions he had been recruited – unwittingly or not – by foreign agents			0
intelligence chiefs believe he is now passing military details to president @entity151 ’s spies .			0
