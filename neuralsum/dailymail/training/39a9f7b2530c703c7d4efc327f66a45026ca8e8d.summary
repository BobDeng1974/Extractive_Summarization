@entity0 truly announced himself on the global stage on monday night as the 20 - year - old won a @entity4 silver medal in the men 's 100 metres			1
@entity0 finished second in 10.10secs behind 22 - year - old @entity8 @entity7 , whose long , loping strides allowed him to reel in the @entity10 after his explosive start to win in 10secs flat			1
@entity12 , the @entity8 champion , was third in 10.12secs			1
@entity0 's time may not have been as quick as the 10.07secs he clocked in the semi-final and he has still to break that magical 10 - second barrier but , quite frankly , who cares			1
@entity7 , after all , is part of @entity46 's training group working under coach @entity47 in @entity48 and , at 6ft 4in tall , bears more than a passing resemblance to the world 's fastest man			1
yet @entity25 's was also an exceptional performance of confidence and class , delivered when it really mattered			2
it was also an emphatic response to @entity57 's criticism of @entity25 's refreshingly enthusiastic and endearing approach to his craft			2
too fast : @entity7 looked comfortable as he edged out @entity25 to take the glory in @entity61 costly : @entity62 medallist @entity12 ( left ) appeared to injure himself as he crossed the line thumbs up : @entity25 poses in front of the scoreboard after registering second place by 0.02 seconds @entity67 : day 5 review @entity0 said : ' i 'm buzzing			1
i ca n't believe it			0
this is great for me			0
i was always pushing for the gold , but that 's my first senior medal and what better place to do it than on home soil			1
' hopefully i can keep progressing and to use this as a stepping stone to be more established in the senior ranks			2
' i just love running at major championships			0
the main thing is that the crowd give me energy that i need			0
' @entity57 is such a well - established man , but that is how i run			0
' i train with a smile on my face			0
i enjoy what i do			0
when i am in the blocks , i am focused			0
