by @entity0 @entity2 people are keen wine - drinkers , getting through an impressive 1.6 billion bottles of wine every year			1
however it appears that while we are happy slurping , swilling and sipping , we are far from experts on what we 're actually drinking			0
in fact , more than two - thirds of us admit to bluffing when it comes to choosing wine			1
the supermarket shelves are packed with wine - but do we have any idea what we 're buying ? a survey commissioned by the @entity20 revealed that 70 per cent of @entity2 drinkers are selecting a bottle of white or red without really knowing what they 're doing			1
its researches found three - quarters of women drinkers and two - thirds of male drinkers were ' not confident ' in their knowledge of wine			1
possibly unsurprisingly , men also admitted to being more likely to bluff than women , pretending to know more than they actually do			0
this could be related to the fact that nearly one in six women said that they considered knowledge about wine to be an attractive trait in a potential partner			0
a typical restaurant scene , but most people have n't the faintest idea what the label means while avoiding the cheapest wine on the list in a restaurant might seem as if you know something about wine - you have been rumbled			2
one in five of us use the trick of ordering the second - cheapest wine on the menu in an attempt to seem more informed			0
across the country , @entity59 were found to be the most confident overall ( 37 per cent ) but ironically were also the greatest bluffers about of wine ( 19 per cent )			2
at the other end of the spectrum , drinkers in the @entity65 are the least confident , with a significant four out of five ( 82 per cent ) drinkers admitting to their lack of confidence in their wine knowledge			1
cheers darling - and let 's just pretend we know all about this lovely wine we 're drinking nearly a third of drinkers said they would be more experimental with their wine choices if they knew more about wine			0
@entity84 , chief executive of the @entity20 , said : ' there ’s no shame at all in not knowing much about the wine in your glass , but it ’s a real shame if a lack of confidence means you ca n’t enjoy it fully			0

70 *%* of @entity95 lack confidence in choosing and *recommending* a bottle
two - thirds pretend they know more about wine to save *embarrassment*
@entity59 are most confident while people in @entity65 are the least
