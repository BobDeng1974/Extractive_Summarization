by @entity0 and @entity1 an ancient human ancestor known as ‘ @entity3 ’ lived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts , worms and grasshoppers , according to research			1
scientists believe this diet explains why the ancient hominin relative , called @entity12 , which lived in @entity14 between 2.4 and 1.4 million years ago , had such distinctively powerful jaws and large , flat molar teeth			1
there have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors , but this latest study from @entity23 claims to have finally settled the debate			2
ancient humans survived mainly on a diet of tiger nuts , left , worms , right and grasshoppers , according to new research from from @entity23			2
there have been various theories put forward over the years about the diet of our early ancestors but this latest study claims to have finally settled the debate @entity12 was an early hominin that roamed @entity14 between 2.4 and 1.2 million years ago			1
remains of the species were first discovered by anthropologist @entity37 in 959 in @entity38			0
the well - preserved jaw gave our ancient ancestor the nickname ' @entity3 '			1
it is widely considered to be the first hominin species to have used stone tools			0
the breakthrough , published in @entity47 , came after archaeologists compared the remains of the ancient hominin relative with baboons in @entity52			1
both were found to have large flat molar teeth and powerful jaws , and both sets of teeth showed similar signs of wear and tear			1
@entity62 nuts are grass bulbs that are still eaten in parts of the world today , and are sold in health food shops			0
@entity67 roamed @entity14 between 2.4 million and 1.4 million years ago , foraging for the edible grass bulbs still eaten in some parts of the world today			0
academics have debated why this early man had such strong jaws , indicating a diet of hard foods like nuts , yet their teeth seemed to be made for consuming soft foods			2
damage to the tooth enamel also indicated they had come into contact with an abrasive substance			0
previous research , using stable isotope analysis , suggested the diet of these hominins was largely comprised of plants like grasses and sedges			0
however such high - fibre foods would not have been high quality to sustain the large - brained , medium - sized hominin			2
researchers compared remains of a hominin called @entity12 , replica remains pictured left , with baboons in @entity52 , similar to the one pictured right			1
both were found to have large flat molars and powerful jaws			1
both sets of teeth also showed similar signs of wear and tear , suggesting their diets were the same by studying the diet of the @entity52 baboons , dr @entity110 from the university discovered they eat large quantities of tiger nuts			1
this food would have contained sufficiently high amounts of minerals , vitamins , and the fatty acids that would have been particularly important for the hominin brain			0
dr @entity110 said : ‘ i believe that the theory - that ‘ @entity3 ’ lived on large amounts of tiger nuts - helps settle the debate about what our early human ancestor ate			1
’ he added : ‘ @entity62 nuts , still sold in health food shops as well as being widely used for grinding down and baking in many countries , would be relatively easy to find			0
‘ they also provided a good source of nourishment for a medium - sized hominin with a large brain			2
‘ this is why these hominins were able to survive for around one million years because they could successfully forage - even through periods of climatic change			0
' the research also claims that our ancestors would have eaten invertebrates to get the protein they needed for brain development .			0

study compared remains of an ancient hominin known as ' @entity3 ' with @entity52 baboons
both were found to have large flat molar teeth and powerful jaws
their respective teeth also showed similar signs of wear and tear
by studying baboon diets , the study concluded our ancestors ate the same
