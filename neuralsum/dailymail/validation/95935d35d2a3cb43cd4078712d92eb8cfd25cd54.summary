reverend @entity0 said around 100 passages in the @entity3 holy book incite followers to violence , including ' striking off heads ' there are passages in the @entity9 which ‘ invite people to violence ’ , one of the @entity13 ’s chaplains said last night			1
reverend @entity14 , the former chaplain of @entity15 and one of 35 who serve her majesty , expressed concern about more than 100 passages in the @entity3 holy book			1
but the @entity21 priest declined to say whether parts of the @entity9 are ‘ evil ’ , instead advising people to make up their own minds			1
he was responding to comments by the archbishop of @entity27 , who warned this week about being too quick to brand people with strong religious views ‘ extremists ’			1
yesterday , more than 60 imams and leaders of @entity3 groups signed an open letter to the government accusing it of criminalising @entity3			2
they claimed the ‘ terror threat ’ was being exploited for political capital ahead of the election , as ‘ the big parties inevitably try to outdo each other in their nastiness ’			2
the signatories , which included journalist @entity43 and former @entity45 detainee @entity44 , criticised the ‘ demonisation of @entity47 in @entity48 ... despite their disavowal of violence and never having supported terrorist acts ’			1
@entity52 was responding to comments by archbishop of canterbury @entity54 who has reportedly claimed young people are turning to jihad because mainstream religion is not ‘ exciting ’			2
the archbishop said @entity48 ’s religious communities needed to do more to provide an alternative to extremism that gives youngsters a ‘ purpose in life ’			2
but @entity52 told @entity66 he was ‘ attracted to @entity67 because it invites people to the extremity of forgiveness and love ’			1
he added : ‘ @entity3 has , i think , over 100 verses inviting people to violence in the @entity9 which @entity67 does n’t have			1
' if you ’re going to invite people to be dedicated ... followers of their scriptures , @entity75 will go around forgiving people and @entity3 will do something else			2
’ asked to compare the @entity83 and the @entity9 , he said the @entity67 holy text invites its followers to forgive and try to lead people away from sin , while the @entity3 text invites people to violence presenter @entity91 said @entity47 would say @entity3 was ‘ entirely peaceful ’ , but @entity52 said parts of the @entity9 ‘ tell you to kill your enemies ’			1
he then quoted verses which he said urged @entity47 to ‘ strike off the heads ’ of ‘ those who disbelieve ’			2
when warned his comments could offend @entity47 , he said : ‘ if they are offended by my quoting the koran they are not offended by me , they are offended by the @entity9			1
’ he added : ‘ if you ’re going to talk about excitement in @entity67 it ’s about delivering people from evil and transforming people ’s lives			1
’ asked whether he would describe certain parts of the @entity9 as evil , he said : ‘ i notice that they invite people to violence			1
i ’ll let other people decide whether that ’s good or evil			1

@entity160 education secretary @entity159 warned that ‘ more and more ’ responsibility is being placed on schools and teachers			0
he branded @entity3 extremism a ‘ poisonous and cancerous ideology ’ , which is ‘ capturing the minds of many young people ’			2

the former tv historian spoke two weeks after three girls from @entity173 in east @entity174 fled to @entity139 to join @entity141			0
