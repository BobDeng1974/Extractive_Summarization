by @entity0 published : 06:33 est , 12 april 2013 updated : 17:57 est , 12 april 2013 these heartbreaking pictures show a rural @entity3 girl of just 18 months old suffering from hydrocephalus , a build up of fluid inside the skull			1
the family of @entity10 , from the village of @entity12 in @entity3 's north - eastern state of @entity14 , can not afford to pay for her to be treated			1
her father @entity15 , 26 , works in a brick factory , where he earns the equivalent of just £ 1.79 a day			1
but without the means to pay for a doctor , mr @entity15 and his family can only do their best to keep @entity10 comfortable as they watch her condition slowly and inexorably deteriorate			1
sometimes misleadingly known as water on the brain , hydrocephalus is caused by a build - up of the cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull , increasing pressure on the brain inside			1
the brain constantly produces new cerebrospinal fluid at the rate of about a pint a day , while old fluid is released from the brain and reabsorbed into the blood vessels			1
but if this process is interrupted , as in individuals with hydrocephalus , levels of the fluid can quickly build up and place pressure on the brain , causing headaches , blurred vision and , eventually , permanent brain damage			1
' left untreated , if it progresses very quickly , the babies usually die because their brain tissues are unable to adapt , ' said @entity60 , health development manager for @entity62 , a @entity64 charity set up to help people affected by hydrocephalus			1
but , she added , if the condition develops more slowly , as in @entity10 's case , the child adapts by growing their skulls to contain the excess fluid			1
however , the adaptation can only go so far			0
desperately sad : babies who are born with hydrocephalus would normally require prompt surgical treatment to avoid being left disabled			2
it can be caused by birth defects or as the result of an infection in the mother the main treatment for hydrocephalus is to implant a thin tube , called a shunt , in the brain to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid to another part of the body where it can be more easily reabsorbed			1
the shunt has a valve inside it to control the flow of fluid and to ensure it does not drain too quickly , which those treated can feel as a lump under the skin of their scalps			2
ms @entity60 told @entity102 : ' it 's done by paediatric neurosurgeons , but its not a very demanding procedure			0
the operation usually lasts about 30 minutes			0
' the shunts themselves usually cost a few hundred pounds , she said , going up to around £ 800 for the state - of - the - art models			0
@entity10 rests inside her house : the main treatment for hydrocephalus is to implant a thin tube , called a shunt , in the brain to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid to another part of the body where is can be absorbed a spokesman for @entity119 , the brain injury association , told @entity102 that shunting is very effective , but there can be complications of infections , obstructed shunts and haemotomas			1
' these are avoided by another operation called a third ventriculostomy			0
this involves creating a hole in the floor of the third ventricle for the fluid to drain through , ' he said , adding that this is only suitable for some types of hydrocephalus			2
experts estimate that the congenital form of the condition affects around one in every 500 children			0
it can be caused by birth defects like spina bifida , or as the result of an infection that the mother develops during pregnancy , such as mumps or rubella			0
the condition can also be acquired after birth by both adults and children , often as the result of a serious head injury or medical condition such as a brain tumour			2
keeping her comfortable : hydrocephalus can be cured by surgery , but without money to pay for a doctor , mr @entity163 only keep @entity10 comfortable and watch her condition inexorably deteriorate without an expert medical opinion , it is impossible to know how @entity10 came to be affected by hydrocephalus and impossible to know what related conditions she might be suffering from			1
in the @entity173 , children diagnosed with the disorder and promptly treated can go on to lead normal lives			0
in @entity3 , things are different			0
in a blunt assessment of his government 's failure to extend a social safety net for the poor , @entity3 's rural development minister said last year that the country 's public health system had ' collapsed '			0
but experts say it is too late for @entity10 , as any surgery could be fatal			1
mr @entity188 , @entity189 and @entity190 at @entity191 , said : ' it is too late to do anything now			0
the brain will be damaged , and draining the fluid can cause problems by causing the brain to collaspe and bleed			2
' @entity10 should really be left untreated			2
she will not make any recovery and will not ever live a life of any independence			0
' hydrocephalus is very common , and we see it to this extent very commonly in developing nations			0

@entity10 suffers from hydrocephalus , known as ' water on the brain '
it is caused by a build - up of cerebrospinal fluid inside the skull
the condition puts pressure on the brain and can lead to brain damage
her day labourer father can not afford the surgery to cure her
