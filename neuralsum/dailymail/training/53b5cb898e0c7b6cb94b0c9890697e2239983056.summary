by @entity0 last updated at 10:13 am on 27th october 2011 @entity1 : ' haunted by @entity3 's fame for 20 years ' glamorous entrepreneur @entity1 likes to describe herself as the wife who was ‘ airbrushed ’ out of @entity3 ’s life			1
there is no mention of her in the outspoken @entity11 star ’s @entity13 entry ; not even a paragraph devoted to their brief 1989 marriage in his autobiography			0
in interviews , there is barely a mention of wife @entity20 ; only effusive praise for his second wife and manager @entity23 , mother to their three children			0
one can only ask : why ? even though it was @entity1 who left @entity3 – long before he became a global celebrity – because , she told friends , he was a ‘ lazy and opinionated slob ’ who smoked heavily and ‘ smelt of an ashtray ’ , his growing fame has seemingly cast a long shadow over her life ever since			1
‘ i have been haunted by his fame for the past 20 years , ’ she told friends			1
‘ it is not easy when your ex suddenly becomes famous and is in the papers all the time			0
i am constantly reminded of him			0
’ she hinted that she regretted leaving @entity3 for one of his friends , and spoke of the difficulties to her second marriage caused by @entity3 ’s fame and popularity			1
she spoke of an enduring friendship with her famous ex. was this what @entity3 was so worried about ? it would certainly seem so			1
for we can now report that @entity1 is claiming that far from divorce spelling the end of their relationship , it continued after @entity3 ’s marriage to @entity23			1
already dogged by rumours of infidelity , and then to be accused of conducting an affair with wife @entity20 behind the back of wife number two , it is perhaps not surprising that @entity3 fled to the @entity72 to suppress the claims with a super-injunction			1
it is perhaps no surprise either that @entity1 might wish to tell her own life story , staking her rightful place in the colourful @entity3 saga which he has – until yesterday – sought to suppress			1
indeed , he reportedly produced evidence accusing her of trying to blackmail him when she told him of her plans by telephone			0
the super-injunction slapped on @entity1 last year meant she could go to jail just for talking about her relationship with @entity3 , despite the fact that she insisted hers was no ‘ kiss and tell ’ , but a cathartic exercise			1
so who is @entity1 , the first wife who effectively became a non-person after she walked out of @entity3 ’s life ? who is this shadowy woman whose voice was silenced when she tried to drift back into @entity3 ’s starry orbit and claim her place in his turbulent personal history ? convent - educated @entity102 was 17 when she met @entity104 - born @entity3 ; the public - school - educated son of a teacher and travelling salesman			1
he was three years her senior and although he was already opinionated and outspoken , @entity1 never imagined her mop - headed boyfriend might one day become famous			1
very close colleagues : with @entity111 in @entity112 , left , and with long - suffering wife @entity23 , right at just 19 , @entity1 first revealed her entrepreneurial spirit when she set up her own company offering flexible secretarial services , which boasted three offices			1
sharing a one - bedroom flat , she and @entity3 married seven years after they first met			1
it seems she did not consider him too much of a catch			0
@entity1 complained to friends that , apart from constantly stinking of cigarettes , he always wanted to be the centre of attention and when he was about , no one could get a word in edgeways			2
even back then , she has told friends , he was ‘ too big for his boots ’ and did n’t care much who he upset			0
his presence was all - dominating			0
but intellectually he was very fast on his feet and woe betide anyone who could n’t keep up			0
they had been married for less than two years when @entity1 claims she left @entity3 for one of his friends , concluding that their relationship had become more like that of ‘ brother and sister ’ than husband and wife			1
doorway clinch : @entity3 with @entity146 @entity3 , who had done four shows for @entity11 when @entity1 left him , was – according to his ex-wife – distraught			1
she claims he cut up all her clothes and lost five stone in weight			0
@entity1 went on to marry @entity153 , with whom she later had two children			2
the year was 1993 ; the same year that @entity3 married @entity23 , his second wife ; the woman he credits with shaping his fledgling tv career into what it is today			2
in interviews , @entity3 has spoken of how it was high - flying businesswoman @entity23 who was the driving force in their relationship			2
‘ @entity23 was keeping me , ’ @entity3 has said of their early years			1
‘ we were living in her flat and i was up to my ears in debt			0
i did n’t tell her how bad my finances were or how i was so hideously overdrawn			0
’ @entity1 claims it is she who introduced @entity23 to @entity3			1
the two women were apparently friends and @entity23 is believed to have attended the couple ’s wedding			0
consumed with guilt over leaving @entity3 , she has told some friends she was instrumental in getting them together			2
furthermore , @entity1 has suggested privately that she believes it was @entity3 ’s heartbreak over losing her that was the real force behind his later success , shaking up his life and giving him extra drive			1
she told another friend that she was the only person who had ‘ ever broken his heart ’			0
with the passage of time , and a second failed marriage under her belt , she ca n’t help wonder what might have been if she had stuck with @entity3			2
@entity1 sold her secretarial company when she became a mother , at the age of 27			2
when she later separated from her second husband in 2001 , she worked as a barmaid to help support her two children before launching her own company @entity195 – selling packaged premium olives to bars			0
@entity1 claims that she and @entity3 have remained friends over the years , but that her friendship with @entity23 has petered out			1
@entity1 has told confidantes that she feels @entity23 might feel threatened by her status as wife @entity20			2
certainly , long - suffering @entity23 had more than just a few reasons to look grim in april when the family ’s holiday to a luxury tropical resort descended into chilly silences , after @entity3 was accused of having an affair with a younger woman			1
the @entity210 had just arrived in @entity211 when the story broke that the @entity11 presenter was allegedly having an affair with @entity215 , a 42 - year - old events organiser who had been among the entourage of @entity3 ’s @entity218 @entity217			2
what people did n’t know , however , was that while @entity23 was having to deal with claims that miss @entity111 spent nights with @entity3 as he travelled around @entity112 , @entity224 and @entity225 , the pair sharing glasses of white wine together snuggled up under a blanket , she was also dealing with the controversy over the injunction her husband was using to silence his first wife			2
this was not the first time @entity3 had been in trouble either			2
back in 2002 , a red - top tabloid reported that the presenter had been seen passionately kissing television producer @entity146 in a car and the pair were photographed cuddling in a doorway			0
so , knowing that wife @entity20 was keen to write her life story – possibly warts and all – must have been a further weight on @entity23 ’s shoulders			0
one she could not breathe a word about because of the super-injunction			0
on their return to @entity250 , @entity3 moved into a @entity252 flat – although @entity23 insisted they had not split up , and that he would be returning to the family home in the @entity255			0
and all the while , @entity1 had to remain silent , alone with her thoughts on her ex-husband @entity3 and quietly fuming at the seeming injustice of it all			1
with the super-injunction lifted , the first mrs @entity3 has her voice back			0
she is said to be considering writing a book			0
but what exactly does she intend to say and what on @entity266 will the second mrs @entity3 make of it all ? last night @entity3 laughed at suggestions that he cut up @entity1 ’s clothes and lost five stone after she left him			1
he said : ‘ i beg of you , please print all those things			0
i so want my friends to read that because they do need cheering up			0

@entity1 left @entity3 long before he became a global celebrity
she says : ' i *'ve* been haunted by his fame for the past 20 years '
