determined : @entity0 , 29 , from @entity1 in @entity2 has a cardiac sarcoma heart tumour when keen sportswoman @entity0 began collapsing during short runs on the hockey pitch she knew there was something deeply wrong with her body			1
but the last thing on her mind – and those of her doctors – was that the cause of her rapidly deteriorating health was the rarest form of cancer in the world			2
within months , @entity0 , now 29 , was told the cardiac sarcoma heart tumour she was suffering from was terminal and in her words , she ‘ would n’t be growing old ’			1
@entity22 sports event organiser @entity0 recalls the moment doctors were left as shocked as she was after she referred herself to a private specialist			1
she said : ‘ he was amazed i was even walking around			0
it was assumed to be benign ( a myxoma ) and i was told that he was 99.99 per cent sure it was n't cancer			2
‘ whatever it was , it had to come out so i had open heart surgery four days later			2
‘ when i came round from surgery i knew , as soon as i looked into my anaesthetists eyes , that what they had found in there had n't been what they were expecting			0
no one would tell me anything though			0
‘ as i was leaving the hospital 10 days after my surgery , my cardiologist delivered the blow - the unexpected had happened and it was a cardiac sarcoma			1
he told me i would n't be growing old			1
’ the discovery of the cancer in january last year was the beginning of a gruelling battle against the disease that immediately saw @entity0 begin 360 hours of chemotherapy			1
the type of sarcoma @entity0 was diagnosed with is suffered by just a handful of people around the world			1
she said : ‘ it all started when a friend working out in @entity86 sent through a picture of @entity88			0
my friends are a competitive bunch and they all just want to out do each other i think			2
‘ i 've not encouraged it or been a part if it at all			0
worldwide support : athlete @entity93 holds a sign declaring ' @entity95 '			2
@entity0 said the support she has received has proved inspirational as she undergoes yet more gruelling treatment helping hand : runner @entity99 smiles broadly as he holds a message @entity0 's friends have put together , while @entity104 striker @entity103 holds a sign saying ' never give up @entity0 ' ‘ it has made me realise though that i have the potential to really raise awareness about this little - known condition			1
’ since the formation of @entity64 , support has flooded in from countless superstars including @entity67 , @entity113 , prince @entity74 and @entity93			1
and their support has proved inspirational for @entity0 as she undergoes yet more gruelling treatment			1
proud to partake : @entity115 superstar @entity113 smiles widely as he holds up his supportive sign rallying around : wanderers on wheels who have raised thousands of pounds for cancer charity @entity119 she said : ‘ it means a huge amount			1
every single day i am facing challenges - physical from the chemo side effects mostly and mental and it 's support like this that really helps give me the strength to keep fighting			1
‘ i have amazing friends			2
it 's strange , but when something like this happens , there are some people you just do n't hear from as they do n't know what to say			2
‘ there are others , people you do n't expect , that really step up and that has meant a lot			0
’ happy to pose : @entity145 hold a sign supporting the brave 29 - year - old adding glamour : sports presenter @entity149 and tv presenter @entity150 lend their support good cause : singer @entity154 and actress @entity155 hold their signs up proudly campaign success : @entity95 's message advertised on the side of a bus her friend of 16 years @entity164 paid tribute to her fighting spirit			1
she said : ‘ her pragmatism , determination and stubbornness has had to endure all sorts of unpredictable twists and turns since she was diagnosed yet there is still this relentless spirited glow which sits in her eyes and her rosy cheeks			0
‘ even when her blog talks of trauma and pain , the glow remains			0
i ’m not sure how she does it			0
when people share her blog and talk of inspiration , the word does n’t even come close			0
’ @entity0 also paid tribute to her @entity187 , @entity188 , brother , @entity190 and boyfriend @entity191 who have helped her fight the disease			1
she said : ‘ we have a very small family but the support from my mum , brother and boyfriend has been amazing and i could n't get through it without them			1
’ together , @entity0 , her friends and family have raised more than £ 25,000 for @entity201 , a small charity fighting to raise awareness about the condition and fund further research			1
what is sarcoma ? sarcomas are cancers of mesenchymal tissue – the connective tissue which holds the human frame together			2
bones , muscles , nerves , tendons , cartilage , fatty and fibrous tissue are the home of these tumours			2
almost uniquely among solid tumours , sarcomas can appear anywhere on or inside the body , and at any age			0
how many people are affected ? current estimates put the total number of sarcomas diagnosed each year in the @entity201 at about 3,200 and this may be an under - estimate due to a lack of clarity in the data			0
about 15 per cent of patients are children and data suggest that about 30 per cent of patients are aged under 30 years			0
in @entity241 , around 2,300 people are diagnosed with a soft tissue sarcoma			0
around 460 people are diagnosed each year with bone sarcoma in @entity241			0
what are the different types of sarcoma ? there are over 70 different sub-types of sarcoma			0
many of these sub-types are extremely rare – just a few patients each year – and have different age profiles			0
what treatment is available ? surgery is commonly viewed as the best option for a ‘ cure ’			0
radiotherapy is often used in combination with surgery , usually afterwards			0
chemotherapy will usually be used with bone sarcomas before and after surgery , although it is less often used with soft tissue sarcoma and only with sub-types known to respond well to chemotherapy			1
what are the chances of survival ? five - year survival rates for patients diagnosed with a bone sarcoma in 2004 were 55 per cent and for patients diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma were 56 per cent			1
however , it is important to note that soft tissue sarcoma survival rates vary according to the individual sub-type of sarcoma and can be better or worse than 56 per cent depending on the individual			0
@entity279 , chief executive of @entity201 , said : ‘ ' @entity0 has been a phenomenal support to our charity , raising awareness of sarcoma cancer through her moving and inspirational blog and social media activity			1
‘ having had the pleasure of meeting @entity0 personally , we have been touched by her motivation and passion for life			2
' her positive attitude is an inspiration to everyone ; her enthusiasm and desire to make a difference to others is infectious and reflected in her huge network of supporters and friends who have cycled for miles , ran monthly marathons and donated so generously to @entity201			0
‘ @entity95 has raised over £ 25,000 in two months towards sarcoma research , information and support			1
we are enormously grateful to @entity0 and her friends and family for their financial support , and their amazing ability to turn their hand to any challenge			1
’ today @entity0 , who has moved from @entity314 back to the family farm near @entity1 in @entity2 , is undergoing further chemotherapy and is also exploring alternative treatments to fight the cancer			1
she said : ‘ obviously , there are lots of tears from time to time , but overall i try and stay positive and see this is as just another challenge that i will overcome , somehow , no matter how firmly the odds are stacked against me			0
’ in february , doctors gave @entity0 6 - 12 months to live and the option of further gruelling chemotherapy			1
she said : ‘ it was a really difficult decision to make as chemo seriously affects the quality of your life and having gone through it once , i was n't sure i could do it again , especially as they were saying that it may or may not prolong my life			0
‘ i decided in the end to give it a go , and the first lot of scans show that it is working , and the tumours are shrinking which is the best news i could have hoped for			1
‘ that said , they are not saying they can cure me and i want to be cured , and i believe i can be			0
there are a huge amount of other things out there to try and so i am doing just that : i have overhauled my diet , and am trying reflexology , aromatherapy , acupuncture , visual imagery and meditation			0
‘ so , the future for now , is all about exploring all of the alternatives and taking control back from the doctors to try and help myself , while at the same time trying to raise money for and awareness of sarcoma			2
‘ it 's so easy to just put your life in the doctors hands and believe what they say , but statistics are just statistics and there are always anomalies			2
i will never give up and that is my promise to all my friends and family			1
' now watch a video about living with @entity375 all in it together - living with @entity119 from @entity377 on @entity378 .			0
