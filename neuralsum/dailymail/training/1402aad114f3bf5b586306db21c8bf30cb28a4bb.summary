@entity0 has dismissed criticism of his tactics and claimed that @entity4 ’s traditional 4 - 4 - 2 formation leaves him nervously ‘ twitching my ass ’ on the bench			1
after discussing the merits of a back - three over a back - four on thursday , the @entity4 boss resorted to talking about his backside			2
in a variation on sir @entity13 ’s famous quote about ‘ squeaky bum time ’ , @entity10 said : ‘ i know that with 4 - 4 - 2 the stats are giving the positive results , but when you analyse the game i have twitched my ass on the bench because we were out of balance			2
@entity4 boss @entity0 is keen on sticking with his favoured 3 - 5 - 2 formation @entity10 , pictured at @entity24 , has said he twitches his ' ass ' on the bench when his play 4 - 4 - 2 ‘ all the matches when we play 4 - 4 - 2 , like against @entity31 , it was always twitching your ass and i do n’t like it			1
’ the @entity35 ’s comments came after frustrated @entity4 fans were heard chanting for their team to switch to a more attacking 4 - 4 - 2 formation at @entity39 last weekend – a move that was rewarded with goals from @entity42 and @entity43			1
former @entity4 captain @entity44 has also urged @entity10 to ditch his preferred 3 - 5 - 2 system , claiming that the use of three centre - backs slows down play and encourages a safety - first approach			1
statistically , @entity4 have conceded fewer goals per game using that system this season , but also picked up fewer points			0
@entity10 admitted that his players are still uncomfortable with the new tactics , and there is a growing feeling that @entity4 should return to the cavalier style that made @entity13 ’s teams so entertaining			2
the @entity35 believes his players are struggling to get to grips with his preferred 3 - 5 - 2 formation but @entity10 dismissed the criticism as ‘ ridiculous ’ and claimed that it was brought on unfairly by the recent home defeat against @entity66			1
reminded of the chants from supporters at @entity24 , he maintained that he must be left to make decisions irrespective of the feeling among the club ’s fanbase			0
‘ i have to take into account 600million opinions ? ’ said @entity10			0

‘ the players are still not comfortable ( with 3 - 5 - 2 )			1
it is very important that they are comfortable , and i would like them to feel more comfortable			0
‘ but after i switched the system we have won nine or 10 in a row			0
then we lose one match and the discussion about the system is coming , so it is ridiculous			0
