@entity0 could be just a week away from putting @entity1 back into the @entity2			0
the 50 - year - old needs just two more wins to achieve the fourth promotion of a career that has been mostly spent rescuing clubs from relegation after goals by @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 clinched a local derby victory			1
in front of a sold - out @entity15 , @entity1 took revenge for a bitterly fought 1 - 0 defeat back in november which ended their unbeaten start to the season			2
@entity1 's @entity12 ( left ) tussles for the ball with @entity23 's @entity22 ( right ) @entity23 's @entity24 ( left ) shields the ball from the challenge of the oncoming @entity27 ( right ) @entity1 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity24 , @entity33 , @entity34 ( @entity35 93 ) , @entity11 , @entity10 ( @entity36 86 ) , @entity12 ( @entity37 94 ) subs not used : @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 booked : @entity10 scorers : @entity10 36 , @entity11 80 , @entity12 87 @entity23 ( 4 - 4 - 2 ) : @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity22 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ( @entity52 78 ) , @entity24 , @entity31 ( @entity53 69 ) subs not used : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 booked : @entity47 , @entity22 referee : @entity61 ( @entity62 ) attendance : 12,302 that finished with @entity23 chairman @entity65 accusing @entity0 of ' lacking class '			1
but it was the @entity1 boss who had the last laugh with a victory that left @entity23 boss @entity71 having to pick his side up from two 3 - 0 defeats in four days that have finished their last hope of automatic promotion			1
just to add to their woes they had both @entity22 and @entity45 booked , meaning both will now serve suspensions			0
@entity1 had actually needed to ride their luck for much of the first half , with goalkeeper @entity28 pulling off three saves in two frantic minutes at one point			0
and @entity23 striker @entity31 cost @entity71 's side their best chance of going in front when he cashed in on a mistake by @entity90 to go through			0
he should have squared the ball back to strike partner @entity24 who couldn ' t have missed but instead tried to go it alone and gave fielding the chance to save			0
@entity1 striker @entity10 ( centre ) celebrates giving his side the 1 - 0 lead against @entity23 @entity98 ( left ) brings the ball for @entity23 as @entity1 's @entity11 ( centre ) gives chace in midfield as if that miss was n't frustrating enough for the visitors , they were then architects of their own downfall when @entity1 took the lead on 35 minutes			1
@entity22 was put under pressure as @entity23 tried to play the ball out from the back from a goal kick , and gave it away to @entity11			2
the young wing back hit a perfect pass to send @entity10 clear to make no mistake with his 11th goal of the season			0
@entity1 had earned that goal for the way they worked to put pressure on defenders , and they made their own luck again when @entity124 stretched to divert @entity98 's shot onto the underside of the bar			2
@entity23 's strike partnership of @entity31 and @entity24 had shared 36 goals and it was n't hard to see why as their movement constantly troubled @entity1 's defence			1
but @entity31 , who had 21 of them , could n't quite find his shooting range and put another gilt edged opportunity over the bar just after half time when @entity50 had sent him clear			0
but that summed up the story of the night with no end product to so much possession , and the game swung back @entity1 's way when @entity47 turned @entity11 's cross onto the top of his own bar			1
with 11 minutes gone @entity11 wriggled into some space on the edge of the box , put the ball onto his left foot , and beat @entity152 with a perfectly placed shot into the top corner			2
and the win was wrapped up when @entity34 reached the byline and cut the ball back for skipper @entity12 to fire home his 19th of the season			0
@entity51 avoids the sliding tackle of @entity1 's @entity161 with the home side still leading 1 - 0 on tuesday @entity50 ( left ) dribbles forward with the ball for @entity23 as @entity164 ( right ) keeps up with him			1

@entity1 's lead at the top of the @entity169 table was extended to eight points following a 3 - 0 win over @entity23
@entity10 scored the home side 's opening goal from inside the box in the first - half
@entity11 made it 2 - 0 with a *superb* free - kick on 80 minutes before @entity12 wrapped up the win from close range later on
