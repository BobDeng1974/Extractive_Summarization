this was the finest drive of @entity3 ’s career in the greatest grand prix of the century			1
it was a privilege to be in @entity8 , where @entity3 and his fellow @entity10 driver @entity9 duelled and duelled again , only inches from perdition at up to 200mph			1
the action behind them was hardly less compelling			2
the race rather made those who had criticised this year ’s brand of @entity16 as boring — not least @entity19 and @entity20 president @entity18 — look as if they were speaking out of their exhaust pipes			1
the victor was @entity3 , taking his second successive win and his 24th in all to equal @entity47 ’s career total			1
it was a race that all the laws of logic decreed he should never have won			0
he started second on the grid to @entity9 , having made a slip in qualifying , but stayed tight around the first corner to take the lead and then held off @entity9 ’s counter-attack on the fourth turn			1
@entity9 did not give up			1
at the start of the 18th and 19th laps he tried to wriggle past @entity3			1
the lead changed hands , by my estimation , five times			2
@entity9 said on the team radio : ‘ what he did was n’t on			1
’ it was heat - of - the - moment exasperation rather than a serious complaint			2
take off : the @entity10 of @entity9 and @entity3 lead the field at the start of the race @entity74 : the field shapes up for turn 1 of the @entity76 in @entity77 and @entity3 takes the lead @entity79 - to - head : the fierce battle between @entity9 and @entity3 began at the outset of the race @entity84 favoured @entity9 when a spectacular shunt brought out the safety car			1
@entity88 ’s @entity87 went into a 360 degree somersault when he was flipped by pastor @entity91 ’s @entity90			0
the two @entity10 immediately came in to be reshod			0
@entity3 had to change to the harder tyre , @entity9 could use the softer			1
the softer rubber is faster so , once the safety car peeled away with 10 laps remaining , @entity9 would be able to pass his team - mate from a gap that had been reduced to virtually nothing by the break in racing			1
‘ i remember our first race in karting , ’ said @entity3 afterwards			1
‘ @entity9 was leading all the way and i overtook him on the last lap. i thought that would happen to me today			2
’ so did we all			0
but , no , @entity3 produced his best ever defensive driving in repelling the relentless attack from behind			2
they were crawling over each other like spiders			0
@entity9 would get in front but @entity3 — in a now - you - see - me - now - you - do n’t flash — squirmed back ahead			1
neck and neck : @entity3 leads @entity9 as they challenge each other wheel - to - wheel watching the front : the @entity10 team watch their cars dominate the @entity8 race burn rubber : @entity20 's @entity123 breaks heavily ahead of @entity125 's @entity124 credit here to @entity10			1
@entity132 , in the first serious test of his pit - wall nerve since taking over as technical director , came on to both men			0
he said : ‘ this is @entity132			0
’ that made it clear it was the headmaster speaking and defiance would not be tolerated			0
‘ with 10 laps to race , ’ he added , ‘ let ’s just make sure we bring both cars home			0
’ it was not an instruction to hold position , but an appeal for sense			0
credit , too , to both @entity151 and @entity9 for possessing the serenity and skill to follow the appeal meticulously			2
the best drive of @entity3 ’s career , we have asserted			2
a case can be made for @entity158 in 2008 , when he dominated the wet conditions , @entity160 - like , to win by more than a minute			0
dig in the ribs : @entity3 and @entity9 exchange playful blows after the race come here , you : fresh from battling on the track the pair went toe - to - toe in parc ferme , too but this was purer			1
here , he was fighting a driver at the peak of his career in an equal car on better tyres in a crucial battle in a formative world championship rivalry			0
so intense was the racing that @entity9 got out of his car and rugby tackled @entity3 through sheer adrenaline			1
moments afterwards , his thoughts calmer , the @entity181 admitted : ‘ i strongly dislike losing to @entity3			1
’ so was this the best of grand prix of the century ? @entity3 ’s title win in 2008 had a single epic moment of drama			2
@entity189 ’s triumph in @entity190 in 2011 was wet , mad and protracted			2
@entity192 ’s victory over @entity193 at @entity194 in 2000 produced an overtaking move for the ages			0
but has any race contained more wheel - to - wheel action throughout the field ? not that i can recall			2
@entity201 fought @entity201 , with @entity202 finally winning through to take third after a joust with @entity204			1
@entity125 fought @entity125 , with @entity124 passing world champion @entity205 for fourth			1
flipped : @entity87 's @entity88 crashes after being bumped by @entity90 driver pastor @entity91 t - boned : pastor @entity91 rams into @entity208 on his way out of the pits leading to a spectacular flip over and out : @entity88 's @entity87 spins out of control before getting airborne lucky escape : @entity88 goes over before his car comes to a stop of the track leading to a safety car podium : @entity201 's @entity202 celebrates his third place team game : @entity10 celebrated their second 1 - 2 finish in as many races - they lead the constructors ' championship pure theatre : @entity9 ( left ) and @entity3 duel for the lead of the @entity8 @entity29 time to celebrate : @entity3 with his winners ' trophy @entity230 fought @entity230 , with @entity231 and @entity232 going at each other hard			1
all this was showcased breathtakingly under a necklace of lights in the desert			0
the special bulbs made the car liveries vivid and high - definition sharp			0
even the build - up to the race was febrile			0
team principals walked in and out of the adjoining offices of @entity19 and @entity245 , the @entity246 president			0
@entity20 chief @entity247 told a phalanx of tv cameras that the drivers were being reduced to ‘ taxi drivers ’ because the new regulations placed an emphasis on such boring matters as fuel consumption			0
@entity19 was in the same camp , as are @entity125			0
although he confirmed that the sport is looking at ways to amplify the engine noise in the next few weeks , he favours the new , greener formula			0
as does the @entity262 chairman @entity261 , who rounded on @entity205 ’s recent remark that the new turbos sounded ‘ s * * * ’			0
@entity261 , both of whose cars retired with clutch problems , said : ‘ being a world champion requires a dignified approach			1
‘ putting aside the language for the moment , the sentiment is inappropriate			0
’ from rows to racing , it was the @entity16 day that had everything under the stars			2
@entity279 moment : @entity9 covers his team - mate in the fizzy stuff as they celebrate what drama : the @entity285 was one of the finest @entity16 races in recent times			1

@entity3 wins in @entity8 after fantastic duel with @entity9
@entity202 completes the podium with @entity201
@entity189 retires on his 250th appearance in @entity16
action throughout the pack with three - times world champion @entity298 *lauding* it as one of the best races he has ever seen
@entity9 admits on the podium he ' strongly dislikes ' finishing second to @entity3
