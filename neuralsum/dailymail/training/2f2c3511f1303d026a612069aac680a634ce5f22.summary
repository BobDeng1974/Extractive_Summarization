by @entity0 a six - year - old who has endured more than 30 operations has been given a new lease of life , saved by her grandmother who donated a kidney			0
@entity8 was born with the rare congenital nephrotic syndrome , and had both of her kidneys removed when she was 19 months old			1
the youngster has had 38 operations and was facing having dialysis treatment for the rest of her life			0
when a kidney transplant from her father @entity19 failed in october 2010 , @entity8 's parents gave up hope			1
@entity8 was born with the rare condition congenital nephrotic syndrome , which caused her to suffer kidney failure at 19 months			1
both her kidneys were removed and she was put on dialysis until her father @entity19 donated one of his kidneys when the organ donated by mr @entity28 failed , @entity8 's parents gave up hope			1
but her grandmother @entity30 ( pictured with @entity8 ) stepped forward offering to donate one of her kidneys to help the six - year - old but @entity8 's grandmother , @entity30 , stepped in and offered to be a donor			1
the 58 - year - old was found to be a match for her young granddaughter and the operation took place at @entity41 in @entity42			1
@entity8 's mother @entity43 , 33 , from @entity44 , said : ' it 's been an incredibly difficult time for us as a family but it 's such a relief to see her up and about			1
' we did n't know if she would be strong enough for the operation right up until they cut her open			2
' @entity8 was on dialysis at home until she was strong enough , but after the first transplant failed we barely dared hope this time round			1
' @entity57 was so brave volunteering to give her a kidney - as soon as they said it she was happy to get tested there and then			0
' i did n't dare dream we would ever get to this point , never mind how well she has done			1
@entity8 is definitely one amazing little girl			2
' the concerned parents first took @entity8 to the doctors with her condition when she was just three weeks old , when they noticed she had a red ' outie ' belly button			2
but they were told unless it got worse or became painful it was nothing to worry about			0
miss @entity43 said : ' we had another check up when she was six weeks old and she had lost some weight			2
@entity8 , who is from @entity44 , was admitted to @entity41 in @entity42 , where she has had her transplant operation the youngster , who had been on dialysis treatment , is recovering well in the hospital , and her parents @entity43 and @entity28 hope she will be allowed home soon since she was 19 months old , @entity8 , pictured with her parents , has had 38 different operations the kidneys of people with nephrotic syndrome do not work properly , causing large amounts of protein to leak into their urine			1
it can affect people of any age , but it is often first detected in children aged between two and five years old			0
the loss of protein can cause a range of problems , including swelling of body tissues and increase a person 's chance of catching infections			0
symptoms can be controlled by @entity103 with the condition have times where their condition is under control , when they are in remission			0
ion can flare up , when symptoms return in times of relapse			0
a small number of children have congenital nephrotic syndrome , which means it is inherited			1
these children tend not to do as @entity118 may , as in @entity8 's case , experience kidney failure and need a transplant			1
congenital nephrotic syndrome is caused by an inherited faulty gene			1
for the condition to be passed on , both parents must have a healthy copy of the gene and a faulty one			0
they then have a one in four chance that any children will develop the condition			0
nephrotic syndrome can affect people of any age , but it is commonly seen in young @entity130 affects more boys than girls			1
only about one in every 50,000 children are diagnosed with the condition each year			0
source : @entity137 ' after that we were in and out of hospital trying to find out what was wrong with her			0
' in my head i never thought it would be anything serious - if she was poorly she would not be eating or sleeping , but she was behaving like a perfectly normal baby girl			0
' eventually a blood test diagnosed @entity8 with congenital nephritic syndrome			1
the condition means the proteins and fats that are meant to be absorbed and excreted in the urine are not			0
the result is that fluids in the blood stream leak into the body 's tissues , flooding the kidneys			2
miss @entity43 said : ' as a parent after hearing those words it consumes your life day and night			2
' you can never unhear them no matter how much you try and push them to the back of your head			0
' it would keep me awake at night and then when i finally got to sleep i would wake up with a sudden urge to check on her			0
' @entity8 is currently recovering at @entity41 , and it is hoped she will be out in six weeks			1
miss @entity43 , added : ' it 's been a rollercoaster for us			2
' we do n't want her to go home until she is better but it 's so hard being away from our family and friends			2
' her illness has led to complications - she now ca n't walk unaided and needs a wheelchair			0
' @entity8 has been on life support five times - it 's amazing how much work the kidneys actually do and the knock on affect on her whole body			1
' we are so proud of @entity8 - we have the bravest , strongest little girl			0
