as budget airlines get more and more stingy , charging for everything from printing boarding passes to on - board snacks , plenty of ' whatever next ? ' quips have been made			1
previously joked about but scarcely believed travel horrors such as standing - only flights and extra fees for obese passengers may soon become a reality though , according to reports			1
while flying first class is only getting more luxurious with on - board showers , nannies for children and private suites , the whole plane experience is gradually becoming a lot worse for those who ca n't afford to fly luxe class			2
standing cabins among some of the more bizarre and worrying innovations in travellers ' future are the vertical passenger seats			1
the idea of the ' standing cabin ' made headlines in 2010 when @entity41 ceo @entity40 suggested that the airline would be introducing it , but spokespeople for the airline have since rejected the idea , nevertheless , the ' @entity48 ' seat has been created by @entity49 , and aerospace engineering professor at the @entity52 @entity51 predicts that the ' standing cabin ' will be in planes within five years			2
that looks uncomfortable : the vertical passenger seat has been discussed for some time , but one expert predicts they will be a reality within five years ' i 'm a frequent flier and most of the times during domestic flights , it feels like the flying time is very short that the aircraft is already descending for landing before you can unfasten your seatbelt after takeoff , ' he told @entity70			2
' hence the big question came to my mind : in such a short duration of flight time , do we really need to sit down ? ' @entity51 's research predicts that standing cabins could increase passenger capacity by 21 per cent , and cut the cost of a ticket by up to 44 per cent			1
the ' fat tax ' with soaring fuel costs , every kilogram counts			2
while some airlines insist on overweight passengers purchasing an extra seat , a new pricing structure could see those over a certain weight threshold facing a surcharge			1
a @entity92 economics scholar , dr. @entity91 , published a paper outlining three possible ways of charging passengers for excess weight , including a per - kilo fee and charge for total weight of the passenger and their luggage combined			1
pay per kilo : while some airlines currently charge overweight passengers for two seats , potential new pricing structures could see travellers facing per - kilo surcharges no life jackets - hang on to your seat cushion instead ! by the same token , @entity111 's regional airline jazz removed all life jackets from its aircraft in 2008 , saving 25 kilograms per flight			1
the airline was allowed to do this as regulations state that flotation devices rather than safety jackets may be used if the plane stays within 50 miles of shore			0
passengers are now instructed to hold on to their seat cushions in case of an emergency			2
will other domestic airlines offload their life jackets too ? all - female flight crew in yet another bizarre fuel and therefore money - saving measure , at least one airline has proposed hiring only female crew , who are on average 15 - 20 kilograms lighter than male flight attendants			1
@entity137 budget airline @entity135 last year announced plans to hire 2,000 new crew members over the next seven years as its expands - all female			1
current male employees will be unaffected			0
female only : at least one airline is going to extreme lengths to cut costs , hiring only female crew members , who are on average 15 - 20 kilograms lighter than males and they 're not stopping there			1
' we are reducing the weight on board our aircraft			0
the size of in - flight magazines has been reduced			0
the potable water tanks are no longer being filled to capacity as only 35 % to 40 % of that water is actually used			0
now the water tanks are filled 60 % , @entity135 ceo @entity158 told @entity160			0
with huge savings predicted , it may not be long before other airlines follow suit			0
pay to pee like many public restrooms , coughing up to use the @entity165 on board may soon be a reality			0
serial offender of the stingiest airlines , @entity41 , is just one to announce plans to introduce coin - operated toilets			1
the idea is to encourage passengers to use the bathroom before their flight , so that airlines can remove at least toilets from each plane and replace them with extra seats			2
removing the loos : some airlines will introduce coin - operated wcs , hoping to discourage passengers from using them - so toilets can be removed to make room for more seats @entity189 everything first passengers were checking themselves in , now some airlines require them to print their baggage tags as well			1
before long , travellers will be scanning fingerprints to board the plane and grabbing food and drink on board themselves , according to forecasters			0
last year , @entity199 began trials of a reusable digital bag tag that syncs with the @entity199 smartphone app. each time the passenger flies , the electronic barcode on the bag tag updates to a new unique code			0
in 2008 , @entity207 introduced total self check - in on domestic flights , which saw passengers check in , tag and deposit their luggage on a conveyor belt to be processed behind the scenes			2
' it â€™s very unusual for us to see any queues forming anywhere at the airport , ' @entity207 ceo @entity215 said at the time			0
' for the passenger , it means less hassle , a shorter journey and an improved experience , and for us it means a competitive advantage			0
' chat at 30,000 feet : the @entity227 may be reversing its ban on in - flight cellular communications in - flight phone calls most passengers have welcomed airlines softening stance on the use of electronic devices during takeoff and landing			1
and the introduction of wifi on board			0
but do they really want to listen to their seat neighbour chatting away at 30,000 feet on a long - haul flight , with nowhere to run ? in january the @entity227 proposed a reversal of its 1991 ruling that cellular communications on aircraft be banned			1
the use of phones in - flight is no longer unsafe because of changes in mobile technology , according to @entity254 .			0

standing cabins , coin - operated loos and all - female crew could be reality
airlines will go to even more extreme lengths to cut costs
passengers will be able to make calls from mobiles if @entity227 ban is reversed
