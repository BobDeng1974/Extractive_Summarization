@entity0 takes over the managerial reins at @entity3 club @entity2 this week			1
he is not in for an easy ride			0
the @entity5 , who has spent two years in the wilderness since being fired by @entity8 in 2012 , has received a three - year contract at @entity2 , with the club ’s chief executive calling him ' a coach with international experience , who will bring us forward '			1
@entity0 , though , has experienced the brutal nature of managership before at @entity18 and @entity8 , and he should not expect to be cut any more slack at @entity2			1
if things do n’t go well for @entity0 , he could soon be the ninth casualty			2
his predecessor , @entity51 , was expected to leave at the end of this season anyway , so @entity0 ’s appointment is without doubt an emergency measure			2
@entity2 , whose financial situation and wealth of coveted young stars mean that @entity31 football is essential for them , are currently languishing in 11th place , with a chronic inability to beat lesser teams			2
@entity0 needs to change that fast if he is to survive more than half a season in @entity21			2
he is highly respected in @entity21 , largely due to the way his @entity8 team beat @entity68 in the 2012 @entity31 final			0
he was also linked with the @entity71 job last summer			0
but doubts remain as to whether @entity0 will be able to change @entity2 ’s fortunes			1
a poll on the website of local paper waz revealed the majority of @entity2 fans are entirely unsure as to whether the club have made the right decision in replacing @entity51			0
a major worry for the pessimists is the fact that @entity0 shares many similarities with his predecessor			0
the @entity5 lifts the @entity31 trophy after winning it as @entity8 manager in 2012 @entity0 is thrown up in the air by the @entity8 squad after winning the @entity42 , also in may 2012 @entity91 is @entity2 's star man and was part of @entity21 's victorious @entity94 squad @entity0 has been out of management for nearly two years after being sacked by @entity8 in november 2012 both @entity51 and @entity0 are tactically astute , but both have had problems in the past dealing with big egos in the dressing room			1
keeping the likes of @entity102 onside often unsettled @entity51 , and @entity0 will have to prove he has learned the lessons from his time at @entity8 and can be a much more authoritative force than @entity51 has been			1
should he navigate the first year unscathed , the @entity5 will have a chance to build something impressive at @entity2			1
the club has produced some impressive young players such as @entity91 , @entity110 and @entity111 in recent years and there is a foundation to be built upon			0
without @entity31 football , however , those talents would almost certainly be heading for greener pastures			0
that is why @entity2 have let @entity51 go			0
that is why @entity2 need @entity0 to make an immediate impact			1
if he does n’t , the @entity21 side will prove to be no more merciful than @entity18 or @entity8 .			0

@entity0 appointed @entity2 manager earlier this week
the @entity5 has not managed since being sacked by @entity8 two years *ago*
@entity2 have changed manager eight times in the last six years
