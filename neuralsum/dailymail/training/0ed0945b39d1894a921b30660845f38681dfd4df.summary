by @entity0 for @entity1 it looks like we might have found the future of housing - and that future is in @entity7 , where architects have designed an incredible seven - storey home with moveable rooms			0
the @entity12 house in @entity13 is already pretty impressive - it features a gym and a swimming pool , but what makes it extraordinary is how its outer rooms can rotate , creating space and also making it adaptable to the seasons			1
at just a touch of a button , three of the outer rooms - the breakfast room , the guest room and the office - can rotate out to overhand the street , letting light in and creating terrace space			1
during the cold winters they can close up , keeping the house warm , while during the hot summer months , opening them will ventilate the house			1
the house has two basement floors , which house the gym and other leisure facilities such as a billiards table , the ground floor has room for parking and the housekeeper 's living area , the first and second floors are the main living space , with the kitchen , living room and even piano area , while the top two floors have the bedrooms and bathrooms , as well as another kitchen and more living space			1
it was designed by @entity7 architects @entity77			0
a spokesman for the company said : ' the house adapts to the functional needs of its users			0
shake it up : the customisable home has two basement floors , one of which houses a gym , while there is also a swimming pool and parking space overhang : the breakfast room , guest bedroom and office can rotate 90 degrees , meaning they hang over the street , making up for the house 's narrow lot how it works : this floor plan of the house 's outer rooms shows how the rooms rotate to create terrace space and increase ventilation ' depending on whether there is a guest or not , the guest room - on the second floor - can be reconfigured for different purposes			1
' similarly home offices and breakfast rooms can change the formality of their appearance according to their residents ' desires			0
' there is always the possibility of having different seasonal or lighting scenarios because of this style			0
' the house is inspired by the traditional @entity7 home , which has both a summer and winter living room to reflect the stark difference in the seasons ' temperatures			2
is this the future ? moveable rooms such as these could be important for the future of housing as space becomes limited the home of design : @entity7 has three homes up for the 2014 @entity135 , including the @entity12 house it can reach a sweltering @entity138 in the summer , while in winter in it regularly well below freezing , so these rotating rooms definitely have a practical use and are not just for showing off			2
the @entity12 house has been shortlisted in the house category at the 2014 @entity144 , alongside other impressive entries from the likes of @entity147 and @entity148 , while @entity149 by @entity150 is up for the award in the @entity152			2
@entity7 is no stranger to futuristic homes - two others are also competing for the award , which means only @entity147 has more nominees , with four .			0
