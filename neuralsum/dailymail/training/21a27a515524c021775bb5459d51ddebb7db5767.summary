by @entity0 published : 15:25 est , 3 october 2013 updated : 03:26 est , 4 october 2013 a multi-million pound expansion of @entity2 ' only privately - run jail @entity3 will see phones installed in new cells			1
but @entity6 , head of security at the @entity9 prison which is set to become the biggest in @entity10 and @entity11 by 2015 , has stressed this does not mean it is going soft on criminals			1
mr @entity6 insisted having phones installed in the 216 new cells , which is also being introduced in other prisons , will not compromise security or public protection			2
personal phone - lines : inmates at @entity3 near @entity9 , @entity2 , will have phones installed in their cells in new expansion plans he said : ' i know people think that will be a retrograde step			1
but once there 's a phone in prison it does n't really matter where you put it			2
' he said use of the landlines will remain restricted and monitored in exactly the same way as traditional cell - block phones			0
inmates can only ring approved numbers and the lines will be shut off at certain times			1
director of the prison , @entity44 , 51 , insisted that the @entity47 - run jail operates a zero - tolerance approach to rule breaking and crime by both prisoners and visitors , waging a ' war of attrition ' on drug smuggling			0
no change : but staff at the prison , pictured inside , insist that inmates phone calls will still be restricted and monitored in the same way mrs @entity44 , who took the helm seven years ago , added that @entity3 achieved a level - 4 exceptional score in the government 's prison rating system in august			1
by early 2015 , @entity3 will house more than 1,700 inmates			1
she said the Â£ 35m expansion - including a plush visitor centre - would help staff manage inmates better and continue to crack down on drug smuggling			2
' people would have you believe that everybody here is having a lovely time with their feet up watching @entity73 and that just is n't the case , ' she said			0
mrs @entity44 said a ' humane ' ethos is at the heart of the establishment and that staff have found that in most cases , the better you treat a prisoner , the better they behave			0
but she said this does not mean she gives an inch when it comes to security			0
the prison operates a modern approach to the treatment of the 6,000 adult and 200 child visitors who come through the gates every month , allowing them to meet inmates in more relaxed surroundings than the traditional visiting rooms			0
but there are still four drug sniffer dogs , specially - trained officers , cctv and intelligence links to help stop drugs getting into the prison .			0

an expansion of @entity3 in @entity10 will see phone installed in new cells
but officials insist phone calls will still be monitored in the same way
inmates will only be able to ring approved numbers at certain times
