by @entity0 published : 18:04 est , 20 november 2013 updated : 18:04 est , 20 november 2013 we do n't need analysts to tell us what we already know			0
the evidence is there on @entity6 across the country for all to see : well - dressed , middle - class women armed with those familiar brown paper bags bulging with cut - price clothing			1
and not a hint of shame in sight			0
@entity14 has become such a middle - class staple that it has even opened concessions in swanky @entity18 department stores			1
a generation ago , these women were customers @entity21 could confidently call its own			1
this month , however , poor old @entity21 announced its ninth successive fall in clothing sales - a trend that has been going on for two years , despite its slick £ 5 million advertising campaign by renowned photographer @entity27 , featuring ' leading ladies ' @entity28 , @entity30 and @entity31			1
@entity14 , meanwhile - playing on low prices rather than swanky advertising - announced a record 44 per cent rise in profits in the same period			1
so is this where the @entity21 shoppers have gone ? and can @entity14 's budget clothing really match @entity21 's quality ? @entity40 took to the shops to see exactly how their winter wardrobes measure up			1
@entity14 : embellished jumper , £ 16 , jeans , £ 7 , shoes , £ 12 , @entity47 : £ 35 @entity21 : embellished jumper , £ 49.50 , jeans , £ 35 , shoes , £ 29.50 , total cost : £ 114 @entity14 embellished jumper , £ 16 , jeans , £ 7 , shoes , £ 12 , @entity47 : £ 35 fabric : the acrylic fabric of the jumper is too fluffy for the embellishments and i kept getting them caught on the sleeves			1
unless you keep your arms pinned to your sides , you 'll have snags galore in no time			0
fit : the jumper is too bulky to be sexy but too rhinestoned to be practical for daily wear			0
and do n't mention the shoes - agony			2
i think @entity14 may have forgotten that women have toes			1
@entity21 embellished jumper , £ 49.50 , jeans , £ 35 , shoes , £ 29.50 , total cost : £ 114 fabric : i love this sweater			1
the embellishments are beautifully detailed without being in your face and the fabric feels as soft as cashmere ( although , in fact , it ’s mostly man - made fibres with 8 per cent angora )			2
fit : beautiful - the plunging v - neckline sits in just the right place for a subtly , sexy look			2
you could easily dress this up a bit with a pencil skirt			0
and the shoes are far more comfortable than @entity14 's			1
verdict : save money by buying your skinny jeans in @entity14 and get the rest from @entity21			1
do bear in mind that @entity14 sizes are significantly smaller - i was easily a 10 in @entity21 but a 12 in @entity14			1
@entity14 : coat , £ 25 , jeans , £ 7 , shoes , £ 12 total : £ 44 @entity21 : coat , £ 139 , jeans , £ 35 , shoes , £ 25 total : £ 199 @entity14 coat , £ 25 , jeans , £ 7 , shoes , £ 12 total : £ 44 fabric : the jeans are lovely and soft , as is the coat - despite being 100 per cent synthetic			1
i 'm not a fan of the ultra-shiny buttons ( cheap fastenings so often give budget clothing away ) , so i 'd change these for something less obvious			2
fit : the short coat has a nice @entity117 vibe , although @entity14 has n't quite got the funnel neck @entity119 catches you just under the chin , which gets annoying quickly			1
again the shoes are painfully unwearable - even though i only had them on for a short time			2
@entity21 coat , £ 139 , jeans , £ 35 , shoes , £ 25 total : £ 199 fabric : excellent on all counts			1
the coat - a polyester and wool blend - feels warm without being too bulky			2
the jeans are beautifully soft , yet nice and fitted , suggesting they wo n't bag dreadfully around the knees or bottom			0
fit : i 'm only 5 ft 3 in so often get swamped by coats , with the result that i was particularly pleased with this one			0
and thank you to @entity21 for some very comfy leopard - print heels			1
these i could dance in			0
verdict : again , save some money by buying your skinny jeans at @entity14 , then spend the difference on the @entity21 coat			1
this red number was one of my favourite finds and feels far more expensive than its £ 139 price tag			0
@entity14 : @entity150 , £ 9 , skirt , £ 14 , shoes , £ 12 total : £ 35 @entity21 : @entity150 , £ 49.50 , skirt , £ 149 , shoes , £ 29.50 total : £ 228 @entity14 @entity150 , £ 9 , skirt , £ 14 , shoes , £ 12 total : £ 35 fabric : the skirt is nicely lined ( i do hate the feel of a scratchy sequin against your skin ) and surprisingly heavy given the price			1
but the shirt is n't particularly breathable , so i would n't advise any heavy lifting or vigorous dancing while you 're wearing it			0
it could all get a bit sweaty			0
fit : full marks for the cut of the shirt and skirt , which is an excellent budget buy			2
not so many points for the metallic high heels			0
@entity21 @entity150 , £ 49.50 , skirt , £ 149 , shoes , £ 29.50 total : £ 228 fabric : believe it or not this skirt is 100 per cent leather , which is why it feels so lovely and breathable			1
the shirt fabric , although man - made , still feels airy and light			2
fit : the shirt is great ( if a little too piratey around the sleeves for a short - armed woman like me )			0
but the cut of the skirt is disappointing			0
neither an @entity187 silhouette nor a pencil , it 's an indeterminate shape for such a bold fabric			0
the designers should be more courageous			0
the shoes pinch a little - not for dancing			0
verdict : i 'd go with the @entity21 shirt ( i particularly like the embellishment around the neckline ) , but save yourself some money and go to @entity14 for the rest of the look			1
@entity14 : @entity200 with chain detail , £ 14 , dress , £ 12 , shoes , £ 12 , @entity47 : £ 38 @entity21 : boucle jacket , £ 59 , dress , £ 69 , shoes , £ 25 total : £ 153 @entity14 @entity200 with chain detail , £ 14 , dress , £ 12 , shoes , £ 12 , @entity47 : £ 38 fabric : the dress looks ok from a distance , but the lace layer was already beginning to tease itself out into very unattractive strings when i picked this up in the shop - not a good sign			1
fit : the lining of the dress was too long for the lacey overlay			0
and , yet again , it 's best not to mention the shoes			0
i like the cardigan , however			0
it 's cut nicely and is a good compromise if you ca n't afford to splash at @entity21			1
@entity21 boucle jacket , £ 59 , dress , £ 69 , shoes , £ 25 total : £ 153 fabric : this lace dress is lovely and soft , and boucle jackets are a particular favourite of @entity236 would expect to pay well over £ 200 for a jacket like this from a designer label , so this really is an absolute bargain			1
fit : the frock is so flattering - it really sucks you in at all the right places			0
the shoes with the bow detail were almost as comfortable as the leopard - print heels			0
verdict : the @entity14 dress looks and feels cheap and is cut very badly			2
i 'd go for the @entity21 one every time			2
as good as the @entity14 cardigan is , i must say that the winning item in this section is that classy @entity21 jacket			1
@entity14 : dress , £ 10 , shoes , £ 12 total : £ 22 @entity21 : dress , £ 99 , shoes , £ 29.50 total : £ 128.50 @entity14 dress , £ 10 , shoes , £ 12 total : £ 22 fabric : i was definitely braced for scratchy lace considering that this skater - style dress cost only £ 10			1
but again , a pleasant surprise from @entity14 - how on earth do they manage it ? fit : a shorter , flirtier style , but every bit as good a fit as the @entity21 dress - for nearly a tenth of the price			1
just a shame once more about the excruciating shoes			0
so tight ! when it comes to these outfits , @entity14 just ca n't match the quality of @entity21 ' wearable shoes			1
@entity21 dress , £ 99 , shoes , £ 29.50 total : £ 128.50 fabric : not a hint of scratch to the lace here either , so well done @entity21			2
the red shoes are reasonably comfortable but not quite as suitable for a night on the dancefloor as the leopard - print pair			0
fit : the lining of this dress was a little too flimsy for my liking , and really was n't as supportive as the chic black lace number			0
you want to feel really sucked in by a va - va - voom style like this and i did n’t			0
but the full - length sleeves are very flattering , especially for older arms			0
verdict : sorry @entity21 , but i ca n’t see a reason to splash out nearly £ 100 on a red lace dress when you only need to spend a tenner			2
@entity14 wins this one hands down			2
or should that be hem up ? styling : @entity304			0

@entity14 have become middle - class staple
@entity21 sales are falling , despite big budget adverts and star models
but can @entity14 's budget clothes match @entity314 's quality ?
