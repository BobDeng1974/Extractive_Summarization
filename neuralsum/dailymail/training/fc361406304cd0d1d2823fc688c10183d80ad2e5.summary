a long time ago in a studio far , far away ... artist @entity0 created these incredible sketches of spaceships that would be made into icons by the @entity6 movies			1
the artwork includes early versions of the x-wing fighters , piloted by @entity10 in the original trilogy of films , and the @entity13 - the flagships of @entity16 's fleet			1
the pencil drawings were done in 1974 and 1975 , two years before the release of the first @entity6 film , and show @entity21 's franchise could have looked quite different			1
a long time ago : the original sketches of spaceships from @entity6 show how different the films could have looked , including this x-wing fighter with just two wings iconic : later sketches show how the two - wing design turned into a craft with four wings that flipped out from the sides , as in the final movies different : this strange ship is actually an @entity13 but flipped around			1
the fighters emerging from its sides suggest that the design of the @entity39 fighter also changed several times as it appeared : this is how the @entity13 appeared in the final version of the @entity6 films the @entity13 appears back - to - front , with the bridge at the traditional front end of the ship , while the flat back end has a large pillar coming from it and fighter bays to each side			2
rather than a series of laser cannons , the ship is instead equipped with three large satellite - dish weapons , and judging by the fighters spilling from its side , was originally intended to be much smaller than the version which appeared in the films			0
as for the @entity39 fighters themselves , these drawings seem to suggest the originals would have been small , white , triangular craft which bear no resemblance to the bat - like ships they became			0
and judging from one sketch , the @entity66 could have had only two wings instead of their iconic four - though a later sketch shows them almost as they appear in the films			2
the artworks were kept by mr @entity0 in his own provate collection , but are going up for auction in @entity75 in december			2
evolving : this later design of a @entity13 shows it has taken on something resembling its final form , although rather than laser cannons it is now armed with weapons that look like satellite - dishes use the force : in this sketch , completed some time between 1974 and 1975 , an x-wing fighter attacks a @entity13 , foreshadowing the epic space battles the films would become famous for @entity87 , far away : these pencil sketches were completed between 1974 and 1975 , two years before the first star wars films was ever released almost identical : bar a few minor changes , the @entity66 appeared almost identically in the film version alongside the drawings is an original screenplay for the first @entity6 film from january 1975 , when it was called ' @entity95 ( @entity96 ) '			1
mr @entity0 's career spanned film , television and news programming , and items from @entity103 's film 2001 : @entity104 , @entity106 's @entity105 and the very first @entity108 film called @entity109 , will be up for grabs			1
also on sale is a set of @entity114 @entity113 flight plans that mr. @entity0 used in studio at @entity117 as he worked with @entity118 in his historic broadcast of the 1969 moon landing			0
mr @entity0 's career began in 1955 when he attended the @entity121 as an art and engineering major			0
after suggesting that @entity121 add an animation major to their curriculum , he then became the first animation graduate from the @entity121			0
after working for @entity127 and as a pr agent for @entity114 , he moved into film and moved to @entity130 to work with @entity103			0
unfamiliar : this ship seems to be based on the early version of the @entity39 fighters seen coming out of the @entity13 , but perhaps more closely resembles the snow speeders used in the battle on @entity136 on the attack : a snow speeder is seen during the famous @entity136 battle scene , the design of which could have been taken from the craft above for sale : the sketches , all done by artist @entity0 , will be auctioned as part of a collection of his film memrobilia , which also includes items from the set of 2001 : a @entity104 and @entity151 during a midnight snack at @entity103 's home , the director told @entity0 that he had replaced his fourth composer and still was not satisfied with the music			1
mr @entity0 was the one to suggest also sprach @entity157 by @entity158 as the opening music , and mentioned @entity160 by @entity161 and @entity162 by @entity163			0
after working with @entity103 , mr @entity0 helped to design and direct the first @entity108 film - then called omnimax - before going to work for @entity21			1
mr @entity0 worked on both the first @entity6 film and star wars : a @entity168 , designing the x-wing , @entity169 , @entity39 , @entity13 , @entity170 , @entity171 , and @entity172 , and @entity173			1
valuable : also included in the auction is this fist edition of the original @entity6 script when the series was still called adventures of the @entity179 he was also responsible for designing the tench and hole which @entity10 fires into to destroy @entity16 's ultimate space station			2
during the moon landing in july 1969 , mr @entity0 was also behind the ' @entity186 ' computer that was feeding @entity118 landing data that was broadcast live on @entity117			0
@entity188 , executive director of @entity189 , said : ' the @entity190 is beyond extraordinary			0
it is a once in a lifetime opportunity for collectors to own a piece of history from some of the most important moments in film and television			0

sketches were done by @entity0 two years before first film released
