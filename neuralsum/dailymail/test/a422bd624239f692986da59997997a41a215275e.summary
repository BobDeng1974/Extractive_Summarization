@entity0 will be 34 at the end of a summer that she looks all set to enter without having been beaten on tour in 2015			1
she heads into saturday 's final of the @entity4 with a 17 - 0 record , and will surely extend that winning sequence against the admirable but somewhat limited @entity8 @entity7			1
the somewhat scary thing about @entity0 is that , by her own admission , she is not even playing her best , and yet she is still ahead of the rest of the field by a country mile			2
@entity0 celebrates after reaching the @entity4 final to continue her unbeaten run in 2015 @entity0 was taken the distance by world no 2 @entity18 in the semi finals in @entity20 the world no 1 has a win record of 17 - 0 since the start of the year and looks unbeatable the younger of the two famous siblings currently has sore knees that are restricting her practice , and she was forced into a mighty struggle in the semi-final by world no 3 @entity18 before coming through 6 - 2 4 - 6 7 - 5			1
at least the @entity31 , the @entity33 's second best player this season , was able to lay a glove on the world no 1			0
every other challenger seems to be struggling in their own way and , while there is no questioning the phenomenal and enduring quality of @entity0 , it also says something about the rest of the field that she will probably head into the clay court season unbeaten			2
1 if she wins on saturday she will have earned £ 4.33m in prize - money already this season			0
2 she has actually lost this season , to @entity50 in january ' s @entity51 , but the event 's status means it does not count in the official records			0
3 straight after the @entity55 , @entity0 flew all the way to @entity57 to play one match for the @entity59 in the @entity60 — which she needed to do to be eligible for next year 's @entity61 in @entity62 ( she beat @entity63 7 - 5 , 6 - 0 )			1
4 @entity0 has lost only five sets on tour this season , two at the @entity55 , one in @entity68 , and two in @entity70			2
5 the player who has won most matches this season is @entity18 on 26 , but she has also lost twice			2
' somehow i 've improvised my way to the final , ' said @entity0 , who could have finished @entity18 off in straight sets			1
' i 'm just not at my best level right now and it 's a little frustrating			0
i am not serving well , i 'm serving at 40 % , so it has n't been my best of times			0
' and yet still she keeps winning , with no sign of the implosions that cost her at the @entity86 last year apart from the @entity87			0
last year was an unusual one for women 's tennis in that eight different players reached the finals of the @entity91 , but those who shared the biggest stages with @entity0 have , with the exception of @entity18 , failed to train on that much			1
in some cases it has been a trying season that has shown again how emotionally and physically taxing it is right at the top of the women 's game			0
the youngest of tennis ' most successful siblings drops to her knees after winning the @entity55 @entity0 has won the last two grand slams at the @entity87 ( left ) and in @entity106 ( right ) @entity107 was forced to withdraw ahead of the semi finals at @entity68 , the only blemish to her 2015 showings the 33 - year - old was presented with a celebratory cake in @entity70 after winning her 700th career match the exceptionally talented @entity115 champion @entity114 has actually sat out the last two significant events , here and at @entity68 , with exhaustion			1
happily it appears likely that she will be returning for the clay court season			0
@entity121 faces the intimidating task of backing up her remarkable breakthrough year of 2014 that few expected , and made a good start at the @entity55 by making the quarter final			1
yet she was in tears at @entity68 as she lost to world no 85 @entity128 and afterwards admitted she needed to relax more			0
in @entity70 she lost her opening match to @entity131 's @entity130 , the world no 113 who is the highest ranked mother on the tour			0
@entity59 's @entity134 , universally tipped as a future @entity86 champion , was another one who struggled to contain her emotions here when she went out to @entity138			0
of last year 's other @entity86 champions @entity139 has retired while @entity141 has yet to build on the strong start that she had in @entity143			1
the world no 2 lost her opening match in @entity70 to @entity147 wildcard @entity145 and it is , in any event , difficult to build up any rivalry between her and @entity151 as she has lost against her the last sixteen times they have played			0
@entity154 's @entity7 is unlikely to provide much resistance against @entity0 in saturday 's final @entity18 is closest to challenging @entity0 ' dominance while @entity141 needs to push on after a good start golden girl @entity121 is a possible contender to challenge @entity0 after breaking through last year @entity59 's @entity134 , universally tipped as a future @entity86 champion , was another one who struggled to contain her emotions here when she went out to @entity138			1
of last year 's other @entity86 champions , @entity139 has retired while @entity141 has yet to build on the strong start that she had in @entity143			2
@entity31 's @entity18 , a relatively late developer whose game is based on her supremely athletic movement , right now looks the biggest threat to @entity0 , and she might well be the best long - term bet for the @entity167 .			1

@entity169 has not been beaten since the start of the year with 17 - 0 record
@entity0 plays @entity7 in the @entity4 final
players including @entity18 , @entity141 and @entity121 have failed to mount a serious challenge to the @entity59 *veteran*
