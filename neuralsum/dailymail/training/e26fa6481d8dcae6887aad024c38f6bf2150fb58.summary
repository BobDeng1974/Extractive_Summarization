by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 11:16 est , 4 february 2013 updated : 15:34 est , 4 february 2013 @entity2 has compared @entity4 president @entity3 to a monkey on @entity6 as he mocked @entity3 's declaration that he would be willing to be the first @entity4 sent into space			1
earlier today @entity4 's president said wants to be the first person to be launched into space by his country 's fledgling space programme			1
@entity2 tweeted : ' so @entity3 wants to be first @entity4 in space – was n’t he just there last week ? ' he was referring to @entity4 's claim that it successfully launched a monkey into space and back , hailing the mission as major triumph in their goal of sending humans into space			1
he mocked president @entity3 's ( right ) desire to go into space and compared him to a monkey that @entity4 claim to have sent into orbit last week the senator also linked to a @entity33 report about the monkey in his controversial tweet			1
@entity6 users were divided , with some claiming the tweet had a racist element because of the use of the word ' monkey ' in relation to a dark - skinned man			1
@entity44 said : ' that is absolutely disgusting			0
' but @entity2 was not without his defenders , such as @entity49 , who said : ' so @ @entity50 makes a joke comparing @entity52 to a monkey and some say its racist ? i 'd say its more offensive to monkeys			0
' faced with criticism , @entity2 later tweeted : ' lighten up folks , ca n't everyone take a joke '			0
but representative @entity63 of @entity64 , a fellow @entity65 , tweeted : ' maybe you should wisen up & not make racist jokes			1
' ' @entity3 wants to be first @entity4 in space - was n't he just there last week ? ' @entity2 in diplomatic row after comparing @entity4 leader with a monkey the veteran @entity23 senator has been criticised for other recent statements that were judged to be in poor taste			1
in january he joked at a news conference about the prospect of a @entity78 colleague being held hostage in @entity80 , just days after a hostage crisis @entity81 killed three @entity23 and dozens of others			2
minutes later he quipped he was looking forward to interrogating senator @entity84 using waterboarding , a method of torture allegedly adopted by @entity89 interrogators			0
@entity93 , himself no stranger to controversial statements , told a group of journalists at an exhibition of space achievements in @entity98 that he is willing to risk his own life to be @entity4 's first astronaut in space			1
' i 'm ready to be the first @entity4 to sacrifice myself for our country 's scientists , ' he said			2
' sending living things into space is the result of @entity4 efforts and the dedication of thousands of @entity4 scientists			2
' renowned for making provocative public statements , it was unclear whether president @entity3 was serious			2
the president 's popularity has waned since he fell out with parliament and his second and final term finishes in june			0
however there was no independent verification of the feat and question marks were raised after footage appeared to show the heroic returning monkey looking remarkably different from when it made lift off			0
the monkey , named ' @entity125 ' which means pioneer in @entity128 , was pictured being strapped into a space rocket and had lighter fur and a distinctive red mole above its eye			2
but the triumphant animal dressed in a tuxedo at a post-flight press conference had much darker fur and no mole			0
nonetheless the launch added to @entity140 concerns about @entity4 's space programme because the same rocket technology could potentially be used to deliver a nuclear warhead on a ballistic missile			1
lift off : footage from @entity4 state television showed a monkey being strapped into a child seat before entering the space rocket hero : the monkey named ' @entity125 ' was pictured beforehand with lighter fur and a red mole over its eye suspicions : the monkey pictured at a post-flight press conference appeared to have darker fur and no mole @entity160 was the first @entity4 to make a journey into space aboard a @entity164 capsule from @entity165 , @entity166 , in september 2006			1
the 40 - year - old telecommunications entrepreneur paid a reported 20 million dollars for a space station visit			0
her journey became an inspiration to women in male - dominated @entity4			0
in 2010 , @entity4 said it launched an @entity173 rocket into space carrying a mouse , a turtle and worms			2
@entity4 's space officials say they will launch a bigger rocket carrying a larger animal to obtain greater safety assurances before sending a man into space			1
defence minister @entity183 said @entity4 will soon send a satellite into space from its @entity186 space centre , which is still under construction			2
@entity4 already has a major satellite launch complex near @entity189 , east of @entity98 , and a satellite monitoring facility outside @entity191 , west of the @entity4 capital			0
launch : this is the space rocket @entity4 claims took a live monkey into space and back leaders say they want to put @entity4 satellites into orbit to monitor natural disasters in the earthquake - prone nation , improve telecommunications and expand military surveillance in the region			1
president @entity208 's second and final term as president ends in june , and his political star has been on the wane since he fell out with parliament early in his second term and appeared to lose the support of @entity216 ayatollah @entity215			0
on sunday he stood up in parliament to play a tape recording that he said provided evidence of corruption by the family of parliamentary speaker @entity221 , his political arch - rival and a likely frontrunner to succeed him as president			0
@entity221 and his brother @entity224 denied the accusations .			0
