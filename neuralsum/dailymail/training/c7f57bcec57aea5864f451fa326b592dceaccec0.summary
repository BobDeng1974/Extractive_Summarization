by @entity0 in september 2013 @entity1 announced they were pretty sure that @entity2 , the most distant man - made spacecraft from @entity5 , had passed into interstellar space			1
and now that finding has been confirmed , thanks to a ‘ tsunami wave ’ of radiation from the sun. the wave vibrated particles in the spacecraft ’s vicinity and allowed scientists to calculate that the probe was in a different region of the universe to our own solar system			1
@entity1 has confirmed that @entity2 , illustrated here , has successfully entered interstellar space			1
data from the spacecraft in september 2013 suggested that it had done so almost a year earlier in august 2012 but the finding has only just been confirmed thanks to an ejection from the sun @entity2 launched in 1977 and has been making its way out of the solar system ever since			1
along the way it made numerous discoveries and observations at various locations including @entity36 and @entity37			0
it is 37 years since the twin @entity2 and 2 spacecraft were launched and the pair continue to explore where nothing from @entity5 has flown before			1
their primary mission was the exploration of @entity36 and @entity37			0
after making a string of discoveries there -- such as active volcanoes on @entity50 and intricacies of @entity37 's rings -- the mission was extended			0
@entity54 went on to explore @entity55 and @entity56 , and is still the only spacecraft to have visited those outer planets			0
the current mission for both spacecraft , the @entity59 , is to explore the outermost edge of the @entity64 's domain and beyond			0
having passed the outermost planets it is now the furthest man - made object from @entity5 and continues to send back data as it becomes the first spacecraft ever to enter interstellar space			1
the recent confirmation that it was in interstellar space was made by observing the effects ‘ bubbles ’ from the sun had on @entity2 ’s surroundings			1
the bubbles originate as waves known as coronal mass ejections from the sun , huge outpourings of energy that often accompany a solar flare			0
these waves are what led scientists to the conclusion , in the fall of 2013 , that @entity2 had indeed left our sun 's bubble , entering a new frontier			2
as they move out from the sun they create the bubbles of radiation and since 2012 three of these bubbles had been observed , but this latest one confirms the earlier findings			2
‘ normally , interstellar space is like a quiet lake , ’ said @entity103 of the @entity104 in @entity105 , @entity106 , the mission 's project scientist since 1972			1
‘ but when our sun has a burst , it sends a shock wave outward that reaches @entity2 about a year later			2
‘ the wave causes the plasma surrounding the spacecraft to sing			2
’ one cause of contention from @entity2 is that there have been repeated announcements that it has ' entered interstellar space ' , with several false alarms , which has become somewhat of a running joke among astronomers			1
however , professor @entity128 , president of the @entity129 and @entity130 at the @entity131 , explains to @entity132 why this is so			0
' i worked on @entity2 's cruise science in the 1980s and 90s and i think it is a remarkable mission , still going almost 40 years after its launch in 1977 , ' he says			2
' it is interesting that @entity1 keeps renouncing [ it has entered interstellar space ] , but that is because it ’s really hard to be sure			1
' the boundary between the solar system and interstellar space is not very sharp , or obvious , but is complicated			1
it also moves as solar activity varies			0
' it ’s quite likely that the boundary has moved backwards and forwards past the spacecraft over the last few years as we have gone from solar minimum to solar maximum , where we are now			2
' @entity2 became the furthest man - made object from @entity5 in the 1990s when it overtook the slower deep - space probes @entity156 and 11 that had been launched previously			1
it will remain operational until about 2025 , at which point it will be adrift in space			0
it will take 17,500 years for @entity2 to travel one light year data from this newest tsunami wave generated by the sun confirms that @entity2 is in a region between the stars filled with a thin soup of charged particles , also known as plasma			1
the mission has not left the solar system , though , as it has yet to reach a final halo of comets surrounding our sun known as the @entity172			0
announcements of @entity2 entering interstellar space are a running joke for astronomers ( shown ) , as there have been many ' false alarms ' before - but this seems to be the real deal but it has broken through a wind - blown magnetic bubble , or heliosphere , that encases the solar system			1
' all is not quiet around @entity2 , ' said @entity185 of the @entity186 , @entity187 , the principal investigator of the plasma wave instrument on @entity2 , which collected the definitive evidence that @entity2 had left the sun 's heliosphere			2
' we 're excited to analyze these new data			0
so far , we can say that it confirms we are in interstellar space			1
' so , how do scientists know that @entity2 is now in interstellar space ? it 's due to our sun going through periods of increased activity , where it explosively ejects material from its surface , flinging it outward			1
these events , called coronal mass ejections , generate shock , or pressure , waves			0
three such waves have reached @entity2 since it entered interstellar space in august 2012			1
the first was too small to be noticed when it occurred and was only discovered later , but the second was clearly registered by the spacecraft 's cosmic ray instrument in march of 2013			2
cosmic rays are energetic charged particles that come from nearby stars in the @entity222 galaxy			0
the sun 's shock waves push these particles around like buoys in a tsunami			2
data from the cosmic ray instrument tell researchers that a shock wave from the sun has hit			2
@entity2 and its twin , @entity54 , were launched 16 days apart in 1977			2
both spacecraft flew by @entity36 and @entity37 ( illustrated here )			0
@entity54 also flew by @entity55 and @entity56			0
@entity54 , launched before @entity2 but on a slower trajectory , will also enter interstellar space in a few years meanwhile , another instrument on @entity2 registers the shock waves , too			1
the plasma wave instrument can detect oscillations of the plasma electrons			0
' we live in a dynamic solar system , with the atmosphere of our @entity64 interacting with the planets and galactic cosmic winds , ' @entity243 , executive director of the @entity244 , tells @entity132			0
' the definition of the solar system boundary is not yet well characterised , and this is mainly due to the very low level of space probe reconnaissance we have done of the outer solar system ; namely the @entity255 and @entity256			0
' to better characterise the extent of our solar system it is clear therefore that we need more reconnaissance and exploration and also to obtain better measurements of the interstellar medium			0
' these are clear science goals for future missions			0
' ' the tsunami wave rings the plasma like a bell , ' said @entity103			0
' while the plasma wave instrument lets us measure the frequency of this ringing , the cosmic ray instrument reveals what struck the bell - the shock wave from the sun. ' this ringing of the plasma bell is what led to the key evidence showing @entity2 had entered interstellar space			1
because denser plasma oscillates faster , the team was able to figure out the density of the plasma			0
in 2013 , thanks to the second tsunami wave , the team acquired evidence that @entity2 had been flying for more than a year through plasma that was 40 times denser than measured before - a telltale indicator of interstellar space			1
why is it denser out there ? the sun 's winds blow a bubble around it , pushing out against denser matter from other stars			0
now , the team has new readings from a third wave from the sun , first registered in march of this year			2
these data show that the density of the plasma is similar to what was measured previously , confirming the spacecraft is in interstellar space			1
and thanks to the sun 's rumblings , @entity2 has the opportunity to listen to the singing of interstellar space - an otherwise silent place .			1

@entity1 researchers in @entity106 say @entity2 is in interstellar space
they confirmed the finding from last year using a wave of solar radiation
the spacecraft is currently over 19 *billion* *kilometres* from @entity5
in september 2013 it was announced it had probably made it into interstellar space , but @entity1 could *n't* be 100 per cent sure
now they are thanks to observing the vibration of particles in its vicinity when a ' solar tsunami ' passed through
' we can say that it confirms we are in interstellar space , ' said the team
