by @entity0 published : 03:48 est , 28 march 2013 updated : 14:59 est , 28 march 2013 a woman who is a criminal lawyer by day is leading a secret double life as a pop star by night may sound like the premise for a tv show			1
but @entity7 is the real deal , working full time as a straight - laced barrister during the day , but unbeknown to her colleagues and clients , she moonlights as a pop siren by night - often performing in front of thousands			1
the 27 - year - old regularly rushed from the quiet court room to the stage , where she swaps her wig , robe and briefcase for @entity21 suits and black nail polish			1
she even sometimes wears her stage outfits under her legal robes if she has to dash to a performance sometimes the singer even wears her costume underneath her legal robes to save time getting changed for evening gigs			1
' i ’m living two lives at once , by day one person and by night another , and sometimes it can get rather confusing , ' she said			2
' music has always been my passion but my parents wanted me to get a degree and a proper job			0
for the last four years i have been juggling the two , working as a lawyer during the day and performing five or six nights a week			2
appealing : she said : ' i 'm living two lives at once , by day one person and by night another , and sometimes it can get rather confusing ' ' it ’s strange as the judges and my clients and colleagues have no idea that i sing			2
' @entity7 , who has just released her first single @entity58 , has a double degree in bachelor of commerce and bachelor of laws			1
she is qualified as a criminal lawyer in @entity65 and so is not able to work in @entity66 , although she does visit clients over here			1
@entity7 has performed at the @entity68 and has just released her first single ' @entity58 ' she has tackled criminal cases for the last four years , but uses a stage name to cover her true identity and is keen to keep her pop career a secret from the legal world			1
' i keep my pop music very separate and only a few very close friends know how i spend my evenings , ' she said			0
' law is a male - dominated industry and very conservative and i ’m worried that people would n’t take me seriously if they found out			0
it should n’t matter , but it does			0
' i look and dress very differently at work compared to when i go on stage , which also helps			0
' @entity7 , who is from @entity87 , @entity65 , but spends half the year living and working near @entity85 , @entity86 , said the clash of roles had caused some problems			1
once she had to be on the main stage at the @entity68 tennis tournament but was still in the middle of her working day and had to ask to be excused to go to a meeting			0
' i literally hopped on a train , ran down there and changed into my clothes , then got onto the stage , ' she said			0
she also finds it hard work when she has long trials and has to squeeze in song writing and gigs			0
' doing a trial wipes you out and i was keeping my fingers crossed that my cases would all finish in time for me to tour and promote my single , ' she said			0
@entity7 , who gets more than 10,000 @entity112 hits a month , writes her own tracks and describes her music as ' very pop , in that it ’s catchy			2
' she is currently promoting her new single and touring			0
the 27 - year - old often has to dash from the court room to the stage and writes her tunes at night			1
