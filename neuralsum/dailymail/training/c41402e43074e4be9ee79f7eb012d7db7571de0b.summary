we ’re used to seeing @entity2 machines on a manageable scale , using small objects like balls and cups to over-engineer a simple task via a series of chain reactions			2
but @entity11 @entity10 have taken the classic device to a ridiculous scale in their latest promotional video			1
a human loop - the - loop , giant dominoes , a sail - powered car and explosions are all used in the impressive contraption			1
the contraption begins with a simple @entity24 ( shown ) , but it quickly escalates to bigger and bigger designs the video was created by @entity11 @entity10 to promote their upcoming lineup of shows			1
it used 9 globes , 3 tyres , a @entity33 , bowling balls and much more to make everything work together			0
the finished article is a four - ton scientific contraption with 38 triggers and 71 moving pieces			2
in the video @entity40 , host of the show @entity41 , sets everything in motion with a simple @entity24			1
this sets off larger and larger systems , with a particular highlight coming with a surprisingly giant set of dominoes			2
later a person is sent diving around a loop - the - loop into a target , before balls set off a series of mini-explosions and a bowling ball goes for a strike			1
it culminates in a blast of fire around a hovering globe with the slogan : ‘ entertain your brain			0
’ this is promoting the science - based shows on the network , which include @entity41 , science of stupid and @entity70			1
such machines are inspired by the famous @entity73 cartoonist @entity2 ( 4 july 1883 to 7 december 1970 )			0
he was best known for his popular cartoons depicting complicated gadgets performing simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways			0
@entity41 premieres at 6pm on sunday 18 january 6pm on @entity79			2
giant dominoes are knocked over before a human does a loop - the - loop			1
the video , which culminates with explosions of fire ( shown ) , is promoting science content on the @entity79 @entity2 's cartoons became known for depicting over-elaborate devices that performed simple tasks in convoluted ways			1
one example is ' @entity91 and the @entity92 ' ( above ) , which was later reprinted in the postcard book @entity2			0
the ' self - operating napkin ' is activated when soup spoon ( a ) is raised to mouth , pulling string ( @entity98 ) and thereby jerking ladle ( c ) , which throws cracker ( @entity102 ) past parrot ( @entity104 )			0
parrot jumps after cracker and perch ( @entity109 ) tilts , upsetting seeds ( @entity111 ) into pail ( @entity113 )			0
extra weight in pail pulls cord ( @entity116 ) , which opens and lights automatic cigar lighter ( @entity119 ) , setting off skyrocket ( k ) which causes sickle ( @entity121 ) to cut string ( m ) and allow pendulum with attached napkin to swing back and forth , thereby wiping chin			0
in 1931 , the @entity127 defined ' @entity2 ' as accomplishing something simple through complex means .			0

@entity11 @entity10 has created a large @entity22
the contraption begins with a simple @entity24
but it quickly escalates to bigger and bigger designs
