it is a tender moment frozen in time for at least 100 million years			0
scientists have uncovered the earliest fossilised evidence of an insect caring for its young			1
the fossil shows a female sap - sucking scale insect , preserved in amber , carrying her freshly hatched nymphs and unhatched eggs on her abdomen			1
the waxy ball like shapes on the abdomen of this 100 million year old insect @entity14 contain eggs and hatched nymphs and is thought to be the earliest example of parental care in insects yet discovered the fossil , discovered in a mine in the @entity22 of northern @entity23 , pushes back the earliest direct evidence for insects caring for their brood by more than 50 million years			1
it is thought to be one of the earliest examples of parental care ever discovered and may help to explain how it first began to emerge			1
scientists claim plants can feel themselves being eaten alive â€“ and some can even tell what type of creature is attacking them			0
the discovery was made after tests on the @entity39 plant found it can distinguish between insects eating it based on the way they chew and drool			2
researchers at the @entity47 exposed a group of @entity39 , which is part of the cabbage family , to cabbage butterfly caterpillars and beet army worms			0
plants attempt to defend themselves using different methods , such as giving off spicy flavours and rancid smells			0
these defences are expressed in their genes			0
based on the gene analysis , the scientists found that the plant can sense when a caterpillar is drooling and provides a different defence mechanism , than if it sensed a butterfly			2
there were also different genetic responses to each worm , showing that the plant knew what was eating it			0
professor @entity73 , a palaeontologist at the @entity74 who led the research , said : ' @entity77 care could have been an important driver for the early radiation of scale insects , which occurred during the end of the @entity83 or earliest cretaceous period during the mesozoic era			1
' although analysis seemed to suggest that ancient insects evolved brood care , this is the first direct , unequivocal evidence for the fossil record			1
' the insect @entity90 is thought to date from the @entity92 period and became encased in sap from a tree that over time turned into amber			1
around its abdomin are around 60 eggs and freshly hatched nymphs , encased within a wax - coated egg sack , according to the research , which is published in the journal @entity104			0
this primitive form of brood care would have protected the young nymphs from wet and dry conditions while allowing them to mature in the relative safety of their mother			2
fossilised evidence of animals caring for their young is extremely rare , especially in insects			2
wingless females were largely immobile , so were less likely to be accidentally buried			0
a cockroach from a similar period was reported carrying a mass of eggs , but cockroaches often deposit their eggs rather than brooding them			0
this drawing of a brooding female @entity125 shows the ovisac containing the brood and eggs coated in a wax covering as a lumpy mass on the main part of the insects body			0
@entity133 makes it almost transparent researchers believe @entity125 ( above ) may be one of the earliest insects to care for its young @entity139 hatched nymphs can be seen scattered aaround the mother insect 's body in the amber in the image above the only other direct evidence of brood care is from @entity148 ambers , which are thought to only extend to around 65 million years ago			1
the latest discovery is thought to be at least 100 million years ago and dates from a time when dinosaurs dominated the @entity152			0
the findings may help to offer an explanation for the early diversification of scale insects - small limpet - like suck saping insects that are common pests on plants today			1
the emergence of flowing plants and ants are thought to have been crucial for the rapid evolution of many new inspect species but were not present when scale insects began to evolve			2
today many insects , such as ants and bees , care for their young , while the behaviour is far less common in mammals where just six per cent of species care for their young			2
the insect was found encased in amber in a mine in the @entity22 of northern @entity23 ( shown above ) @entity125 is an ancient ancestor this sap - sucking scale insect that are now common garden pests			1

sap - sucking scale insect called @entity90 was preserved in amber
the insect was discovered in a mine in @entity22 , northern @entity23
it is thought to be the earliest example of parental care in insects yet found
scientists hope it might shed light on how parental care of young evolved
