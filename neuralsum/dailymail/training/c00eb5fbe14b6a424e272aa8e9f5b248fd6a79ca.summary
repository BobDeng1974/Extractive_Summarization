the claim has not yet been settled			2
@entity113 , conservative mp for @entity114 , @entity115 , said the figures were evidence that a ' compensation culture ' has spread to the force			1
he said : ' we have lost the plot in terms of what we think it is acceptable to claim for			2
' we are inundated with ambulance - chasing adverts on tv for no - win no - fee services			2
' if you slip on ice while you are at home you are a dozy twit - if you do it at work all of a sudden it 's someone else 's fault			0
' retired policeman @entity135 , 75 , yesterday criticised the payouts and said he was ' surprised ' officers had become part of a compensation culture ' sweeping the nation '			0
mr @entity135 , who served with @entity141 from 1967 to 1993 , said : ' it 's all to do with this claim culture , it 's like a disease and people are jumping on the bandwagon			0
i do n't know where it is going end			0
' i 'm surprised the blame culture has spread to the police force			1
but everybody else is jumping on board , so it 's just human nature			0
' it 's costing the country a lot of money , it could be spent on policing and put to much better use			1
' it 's crazy really			0
what we need back is the man on the beat , it 's become an endangered species			1
' they ca n't stop people claiming , it 's just going to go on and on			0
i 'm just glad i 'm retired and out of it			0
' in total £ 446,999 has been paid out by the @entity13 to injured officers and civilian staff			1
@entity178 , police and crime commissioner for @entity115 , added : ' the force need to take a firm but fair line on this			1
' police officers when they join know they are taking on a demanding and dangerous role and know getting injured is a real possibility			1
' but at the same time if the force has been negligent we need to satisfy that and pay a fair degree of compensation			1
' but @entity192 , chairman of the @entity115 branch of the @entity194 , defended the right of officers to make claims			0
he said : ' you do not get thousands of pounds because you have tripped over something - you get it because you have suffered a serious injury			2
' if you went to any other organisation that employed about 4,000 people over a number of sites and asked them how many claims had they had , i think we could fair quite well			0
' this information does not give the details of what can be nasty , life - changing injuries			0
our members should have the same rights as anyone in any other organisation			0
' meanwhile figures reveal the @entity14 has received 44 compensation claims from officers and staff between january 2010 and march this year			1
of those , 16 claims have been successful and ten were rejected			0
the others are still ongoing			0
although most claims had been brought by officers , some had been made by civilian members of staff			2
dangerous job : @entity13 has also made six payouts - including one £ 17,826 settlement - to officers who have been bitten by the force 's own dogs ( stock image ) @entity234 , chair of the @entity235 , added most officers are reasonable and will not claim for compensation unless it is necessary			1
he said : ' officers are entitled to the same protection as any other member of the public when it comes to injury			1
' if compensation is due , compensation is due			0
by the same token , i expect a level of common sense and reason			0
' there is absolutely an element of risk in policing			0
the vast majority of officers will have had bumps , knocks , scrapes and all kinds of injuries and it wo n't have crossed their minds to claim			0
' it is part of the rough and tumble of the job			0
' most officers will seek advice from the @entity194 , which runs its own claim line for officers			0
mr @entity234 said all cases are reviewed and evaluated by an independent solicitor to assess whether they will be successful			0
he said : ' the force 's insurers are very thorough and do n't pay out unless there is some fault there			2
' we will have people come to us and , if we do n't think they will be successful , we will give them a reality check			0
' at the end of the day , it is our members ' money and taxpayers ' money that will be paid out			2
' statistics : @entity14 has received 44 compensation claims from staff between january 2010 and march this year - with 16 claims successful , 10 rejected and the rest ongoing however , mr @entity234 said such claims can improve safety for other officers			1
he continued : ' if officers have been injured , money does n't make it all better			2
it is about providing some comfort , or medical appliances that are needed , and it is also about demonstrating to the force that the right health and safety measures were not in place and they can correct them			2
' @entity306 , deputy head of @entity13 legal services , said the force reviewed outstanding claims every month - with checks made by the deputy chief constable			1
he said : ' while some incidents may apparently seem to be trivial , the consequences which might flow from them can , on occasion , be very significant			0
' claims are handled in - house and all are carefully scrutinised to ensure compensation is only paid in cases where that is appropriate and the amounts paid are in line with the guidance issued by the @entity326			2
' the figures have been criticised by the @entity74 , which argued it included ' trivial claims ' , such as an officer receiving £ 1,200 for sprains after a strap broke on some portable equipment			2
@entity333 , spokesman for the @entity74 in @entity334 , said : ' there appears to be no doubt that the compensation culture in @entity338 is out of hand			0
' police officers should not be pursuing trivial claims such as when a strap breaks on equipment			0
' accidents like these happen every day			0
they should be leading by example and remember that taxpayers are picking up the bill			0
' the details of the compensation claims were revealed following a request by the @entity353 under the @entity8			0
the response does not reveal whether the injuries were sustained while officers were responding to call - outs or whether they were on force property .			2
