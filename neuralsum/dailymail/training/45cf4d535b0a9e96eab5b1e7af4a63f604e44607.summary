by @entity0 victim : the unnamed woman says she was raped by @entity3 when she was a 16 - year - old virgin a woman has told how she became pregnant after @entity3 lured her to a hotel room and raped her when she was a 16 - year - old virgin			1
now 65 , she recalled the ‘ shame ’ of being taken to a doctor by her mother to have an illegal abortion , without painkillers , and spent two years paying back her grandmother for the cost of the procedure			1
she met @entity3 in 1963 when she was invited to speak on @entity14 , for which he was a dj , about her @entity17 fan club			1
he told her he was going to meet @entity17 the following month and asked her to give him a photograph of herself that he could show @entity19			1
the teenager obliged and was delighted when , upon his return , @entity3 phoned her home to invite her to his @entity24 hotel because he had a gift to give her ‘ from @entity17 ’			1
the junior secretary walked to his @entity28 hotel after work , feeling ‘ as if i had died and gone to heaven because i was about to speak to a man who had met @entity17 ’			1
breaking a 50 - year silence , she said : ‘ you ca n’t imagine how excited i was to find out what @entity17 had said to him			1
‘ his room was on the ground floor right next to the reception , and when i knocked on the door , he answered in his pyjamas			1
‘ the only man i had ever seen in his pyjamas was my father so i was quite surprised			1
‘ as soon as i got inside he pinned me against the wall and started kissing me hard			1
‘ i said “ stop , stop ”			2
he was trying to encourage me not to struggle and saying , “ you ’re an angel ”			2
‘ i wanted to shout but i was too embarrassed			2
i did n’t want anyone to know what was happening			2
’ she described how he forced her on to the bed and raped her			1
the pretty blonde teenager weighed just six - and - a - half stone			2
she said : ‘ i could n’t stop him			2
i was telling him it hurt			2
i was holding my body so tight to try to stop him , but he was so heavy , he was too strong			2
‘ afterwards he said to me “ you ’re all right now ” , as if he had done me a favour			1
’ @entity3 got dressed and , shortly after , a male friend of the star knocked on the door			1
he opened it and the man looked straight at her , lying in the bed frozen with terror			2
‘ he asked @entity3 if he was ready to go for dinner and @entity3 turned and asked me if i wanted to join them			1
i shook my head and he left , ’ she said			2
tricked : the woman , pictured at another photoshoot aged 17 , says she was lured to @entity3 's hotel room by the prospect of gifts from her idol @entity17 @entity3 left three badges on the dressing table for her , apparently from @entity17			1
they said ‘ i ’m a kissin ’ cousin ’ , a reference to the film he appeared in			2
she still has them today			2
‘ i had to get the train home and i was worried people could tell , ’ she said			2
‘ i was late home for tea , but i had to pretend everything was normal			2
’ she missed her next two periods and , suspecting she was pregnant , took the day off work and tried to induce a miscarriage			1
her parents realised something was wrong and her mother asked whether she was pregnant			1
‘ i told her i thought i was , ’ she said			2
‘ they knew it was @entity3 because he called the house the same week to speak to me			1
my mum told him i was pregnant and he said “ it ’s not possible ”			1
he did n’t call again			2
’ the woman recalls her father , a plumber , ‘ crying in the front room ’ during this time			1
‘ for his daughter to have gone through that , it was hard for him , ’ she said			2
‘ my mum was raised by strict @entity114 parents and she was less emotional and more practical about it			2
’ she took her daughter to their local gp on a sunday morning when the surgery was usually closed			2
the doctor was known to carry out abortions illegally for women in the area			0
the @entity124 was not passed until four years later , in 1967 , allowing terminations to be carried out by registered practitioners			0
the doctor was paid £ 150 by the family – the equivalent of £ 2,200 today			0
she was given no painkillers and describes gripping the sides of the bed in agony during the procedure			0
painful debt : she was forced to have an abortion , borrowing £ 150 from her grandmother			0
despite this horrific incident , however , she went on to have a modelling career - and later married and has three children ‘ the worst bit was that we could n’t afford the abortion so my nan had to lend us the money			0
i paid it back in instalments for the next two years out of my secretary wages , ’ she said			0
‘ we were a close family and i had had the most lovely , innocent childhood , so it was hard for my parents			0

we were a little family from @entity153			0
after the abortion , we never spoke about it again			0
’ her parents have since passed away			0

by chance , when she was 23 , she met her attacker again when she was picked by a modelling agency to dance and stand behind the djs presenting @entity164			0
she said : ‘ i was excited to be on the show and wore black satin hot pants			0
i thought it would be good for my modelling career			0
but when i got there and they told me it was @entity3 , i felt sick			1
on screen with @entity174 : the victim appeared as a dancer @entity164 seven years after the attack and said she ' felt sick ' when she found out who was presenting ‘ i told myself he would n’t recognise me , but he turned around and noticed me			1
but then he said , “ it ’s you , it ’s angel ”			0
i did n’t say anything			0
he looked a bit taken aback and i was pleased by that			0
i was older and he could n’t hurt me			0
’ the woman has since married and has three children and several grandchildren			1
she has bravely agreed to release photographs of herself as a teenager , to show how she looked when @entity3 assaulted her – but she wishes to remain anonymous because she has never told her children what happened			1
tragically , she suffered several miscarriages in her 20s and ‘ always wondered if it was because of what they did to me when i had the abortion ’			0
she says she was also faced with seeing and hearing her attacker wherever she went – on the television , on the radio and in print			0
@entity3 ’s career peaked in the 1970s and he fronted several prime - time shows			1
she said : ‘ i could n’t watch him when he came on the television			0
i had to leave the room			1
it was n’t @entity3 to me , it was the man who had forced himself on me and it brought it all back when i saw his face			1
’ when he died , she said she was ‘ sickened ’ by all the tributes			0
‘ i was angry that everyone kept saying how great he was			0
’ now , she says she wants to see him stripped of his knighthood posthumously			0
she said : ‘ when it started to come out that he had attacked other girls i felt relieved			0
you think it is just you and something you did to make it happen			0
‘ i want people to know what he was really like			0
i want justice to be done and for people to know the truth			0
’ she married her husband in the 1980s and has three children			0
she continued to work as a secretary for several years before becoming a full - time mother and housewife			1
the woman , who lives in a smart detached house , confided in her husband about the rape , but kept it from friends and family			1
