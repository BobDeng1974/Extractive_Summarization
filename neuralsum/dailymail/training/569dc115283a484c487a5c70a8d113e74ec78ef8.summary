the @entity9 heard how he made a series of ' cataclysmic ' errors when his wife was arrested , including hiding his ' rather large ' stash of lesbian porn			2

protection : @entity0 was accused of orchestrating a campaign for hiding materials from detectives to protect his wife , former @entity37 editor @entity15 , but his defence claimed he was ' daft ' , not a criminal photographs of the bags and lists of their contents were shown to the trial jury			1

ms @entity15 told the jury : ' he said he had hidden a rather large porn collection			1
' i just lost it , i could n't believe it			0

' it was the final straw of quite a cataclysmic few days			0
' mr @entity0 later said he only hid a stash of lesbian porn to avoid police finding it and leaking details of his ' smut ' to the press			1

mr @entity0 told the jury he ' incredibly stupidly ' decided to hide a bag containing explicit dvds and a case with a laptop inside , but claims it was not cover to up a crime			1

a security team marshalled @entity0 used codewords from @entity123 movies as they tried to dispose of incriminating evidence , the @entity9 heard			1
@entity127 workers took computers and documents from the couple 's homes in @entity27 and @entity132 to keep it out of the hands of the police investigating phone hacking , the jury was told			2
the material was then stashed in a black bag and hidden behind a bin outside the @entity0 's @entity22 flat by a security guard pretending to be a pizza delivery worker , the prosecution said			1
after making the drop in an underground car park he texted a colleague to say : ' @entity145 to @entity146			0
pizza delivered and the chicken is in the pot ' - a reference to war film ' @entity152 ' starring @entity153 and @entity154			0
