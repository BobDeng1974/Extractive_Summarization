by @entity0 published : 12:51 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 13:25 est , 24 january 2014 three decades ago , in an auditorium in @entity4 , @entity2 unveiled what was set to revolutionise home computing			1
the @entity8 computer had a 9 - inch screen , used floppy disks and was powered by a 32 - bit processor and @entity12 - all for $ 2,495			1
it replaced the need to type in commands with point - and - click menus , introduced drag and drop and launched the type of graphical user interface seen across pcs , phones , and tablets around the world today			1
it featured a 9 - inch screen and was powered by a 32 - bit processor and @entity12 - all for $ 2,495			1
it replaced the need to type in commands with point - and - click menus and introduced drag and drop on 22 january 1984 , an advert for the @entity8 computer was shown during that year 's @entity35			1
directed by @entity37 , the advert ends with a message : ' on january 24th , @entity39 will introduce @entity8			1
and you 'll see why 1984 wo n't be like ' 1984			0
' the 60 - second ad alluded to @entity42 from @entity44 's novel 1984 and was seen as a dig at @entity39 's leading rival at the time , @entity47			1
the @entity8 , the ad implied , would save people from a computing future dominated by @entity47			1
@entity39 's @entity8 never succeeded in toppling @entity47 's pcs , which live on through clones made by countless other manufacturers			2
but @entity8 did make a lasting impact			2
by 1995 , @entity56 pcs came to look much like @entity8			2
it is still considered one of the best ads of all time ever , an athlete tries to save humanity from conformity			0
the first @entity8 also featured a 3.5 - inch floppy disk drive , at a time when a 5.25 - inches was the standard			1
the @entity8 used the smaller drive for practical reasons , as the larger floppies were n't reliable			2
by comparison , the @entity68 has a 9.7 - inch screen and the current @entity71 starts at @entity72 - more than 90,000 times as much as the 1984 model			1
to celebrate the event , @entity39 has created a @entity8 30 mini site			1
the concepts seen in the original @entity8 are so fundamental today , it 's hard to imagine a time when they existed only in research labs - primarily @entity81 's @entity80			1
@entity39 co-founder @entity2 and his team got much of their inspiration from @entity80 , which they visited while designing the @entity8 the @entity8 has had ‘ incredible influence on pretty much everybody 's lives all over the world since computers are now so ubiquitous , ’ said @entity91 , a professor at @entity93 's @entity92			2
‘ pretty much all consumer electronics are adopting all of the same kinds of interactions			0
’ @entity39 did n't invent these tools , nor was the @entity8 the first to use them			2
@entity81 sold its own mouse - based @entity99 computer , and @entity39 's @entity101 beat the @entity8 by months , but they were relative flops with consumers			1
instead , the @entity8 prevailed and its success was attributed to the fact @entity39 engineers took the ideas from these earlier models and made them more user - friendly			1
@entity39 co-founder @entity2 , left and @entity110 are shown presenting the @entity8 computer during a shareholder meeting in @entity113 , january 1984 to celebrate the event , @entity39 has created a @entity8 30 mini site , pictured			1
the original @entity8 is pictured left , with the current @entity8 pictured right			1
by comparison , the @entity68 has a 9.7 - inch screen and the current @entity71 starts at @entity72 of memory - more than 90,000 times as much in particular , @entity81 used a three - button mouse in its @entity122 prototype computer , whereas @entity39 settled on one - allowing people to keep their eyes on the screen without worrying about which button to press			1
its price was also a factor , and the @entity8 was four times cheaper than the @entity101			2
@entity39 insisted on uniformity , so copying and pasting text and deleting files would work the same way from one application to another			0
that reduced the time it would take to learn a new program			0
the @entity8 , pictured , featured a 3.5 - inch floppy disk drive - at a time when a 5.25 - inches were standard @entity39 also put a premium on design			1
for example , early @entity8 showed a happy face when they started up and icons and windows had rounded corners			2
such details made computers appear friendlier and easier to use - at least subconsciously - to the user , @entity91 said			0
one of the first applications enabled by the @entity8 's interface was desktop publishing			2
early computers generated text the way a typewriter would - character by character , one line at a time			0
users had a limited number of characters , with no variation in appearance			0
the @entity8 was one of the first to approach displays like a tv - text gets incorporated into a graphic that the computer projects on the screen pixel by pixel			1
initially , many people ' thought it was a waste of time and a gimmick , ' explained @entity178 , senior curator of the @entity179 in @entity180			0
he said long - time computer users already knew how to perform computing tasks ' very efficiently with just two or three keystrokes			2
it might have been more efficient for them than to use a mouse			0
' @entity187 , a @entity188 analyst who has followed @entity39 for more than three decades , said he was baffled , yet intrigued when he saw the @entity8 's unveiling at an @entity39 shareholders meeting in 1984			1
in 1998 , @entity39 unveiled the @entity191 , pictured			0
pcs at the time were typically housed in uniform , beige boxes			0
the first imacs looked more like tvs and came in a variety of colors over the years in july 2000 @entity2 unveiled @entity39 's 8 - inch cube computer the @entity200 , pictured , during his keynote address at @entity202 in @entity203			1
the @entity204 was praised for its design , even though it did n't sell well @entity206 , @entity39 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing , pictured , unveiled the latest @entity71 in @entity207 last year			2
it has 90,000 times more ram than the original @entity8 ' this really was a complete departure from the computing that we knew , ' he said			1
' none of us had any clue what its potential would be			0
' in fact , despite its radical interface , sales were lukewarm			0
for years , it was mostly a niche product for publishers , educators and graphics artists			0
now the world 's most valuable company , @entity39 nearly died in the 1990s as its market share dwindled			0
after a 12 - year absence from @entity39 , @entity2 returned in 1997 to head the company			0
a year later , he introduced the @entity191 , a desktop computer with shapes and colours that departed from beige @entity56 boxes at the time			0
then came the @entity237 music player in 2001 , the iphone in 2007 and the @entity68 tablet in 2010			2
in recent years , pcs have declined as consumers turn to mobile devices			0
@entity39 sold 16 million @entity8 in the year ending 28 september , down 10 per cent from a year earlier			0
by contrast , @entity244 sales grew 20 per cent to 150 million and @entity68 by 22 per cent to 71 million			0
the @entity8 has aged to the point that it 's starting to draw inspiration from iphones and @entity68			1
several @entity8 apps have been refined to look and work more like mobile versions			0
@entity8 now have notifications and other features born on mobile devices			0
@entity56 computers , meanwhile , now emphasise tablets ' touch - base interfaces .			0

the original @entity8 computer was launched on 24 january 1984
there have been a total of 30 *incarnations* of the @entity8 product released
its advert , directed by @entity37 , was shown during the @entity35
*specifications* *included* a 9 - inch screen and @entity12
by comparison , the @entity68 screen is 9.7 - inch and the @entity71 has @entity273
