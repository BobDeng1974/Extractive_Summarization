a dog with an ' unbelievable ' sense of smell has been able to sniff out thyroid cancer in people not yet diagnosed with the disease			1
@entity7 researchers said that on a test of 34 patients , @entity8 showed 88 per cent accuracy in finding tumours			1
@entity8 was trained to lie down when he could smell thyroid cancer in a sample of urine and turn away if it was clean			1
a dog with an ' unbelievable ' sense of smell has been able to sniff out thyroid cancer in people not yet been diagnosed with the disease			1
the @entity7 researchers said that on a test of 34 patients , @entity8 showed 88 per cent accuracy in finding tumours researchers at the @entity26 said @entity8 only made two false positives and two incorrect ' all - clear ' diagnoses			1
' what we have done , no one has attempted to do , ' said lead author @entity32 , who noted past studies showing trained dogs can reliably tell the difference between cancerous and non-cancerous tissues			2
' we have taken the next step by asking the dog to tell us whether or not cancer exists before the medical diagnostic system does			0
' we wanted to see , can the doctor utilise the dog to help diagnose cancer ? ' thyroid tumours , which occur in a gland in the neck , are relatively rare and usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and testing its hormone levels			1

thyroid tumours ( artist 's illustration right ) , which occur in a gland in the neck , are relatively rare and usually diagnosed by taking a blood sample and testing its hormone levels ' detecting and diagnosing thyroid cancer can be difficult , because it 's often looking for a very small number of occurrences in a very large background of benign nodules , ' said dr @entity64 at the @entity26			1
' it is also difficult to say with certainty that a patient is cancer - free after surgery			2
' dogs , however , can sense it as their ability to smell is 10 times better than that of humans			1
the researchers now want to see if @entity8 , and other dogs , could be used as a diagnostic test for different types of cancer			1
@entity80 told the @entity81 that using dogs would be impractical			0
however , it added that discovering the chemicals the dogs can smell could lead to better tests			2
researchers at the @entity26 said @entity8 only made two false positives and two incorrect ' all - clear ' diagnoses			1
pictured is dr @entity32 , who found @entity8 as a stray ' having a technique with which to do these things with a higher degree of certainty would be a tremendous advance in thyroid cancer , ' said dr @entity64			1
the implications could be tremendous , the researchers said , both in terms of cost savings in diagnoses and especially the prevention of unnecessary surgeries			0
additionally , the method could be transported to under - served areas where traditional detection methods of biopsy and ultrasound are unavailable			0
the researchers believe the training could also potentially be used in diagnosis of other cancers such as ovarian , breast , kidney , bladder and prostate			0
@entity119 , 46 , had no idea she had a lump in her breast until her two - year - old border collie @entity123 began to repeatedly cry , paw and nuzzle at her chest earlier this year , it was revealed a woman has had an aggressive cancerous tumour removed after the dog she rescued from a life of misery sniffed out an aggressive tumour in the nick of time			0
@entity119 , 46 , had no idea she had a cancerous lump in her breast until her two - year - old border collie @entity123 began to repeatedly cry , paw and nuzzle at her chest - and she now credits him with saving her life			0
the mother - of - four from @entity140 wondered what was wrong , and when she put her hand to her chest she realised she had a lump			0
she visited her gp and was diagnosed with cancer but has now had the tumour , which she was told was advanced at grade three , removed			0
in the two weeks before she was operated on the lump had grown by an incredible five millimetres and @entity119 believes that if it was n't for @entity123 she could have been dead by summer			0
stay - at - home - mum @entity119 now wants to let other people know that they should take notice of dogs if they start to draw attention to a certain area of their owners ' body			2
' thyroid cancer is our template , ' said dr @entity32			1
' it 's one of the fastest growing cancers in terms of occurrences in the world			0
' it 's not one of the highest mortality cancers , but one of the fastest growing in terms of newly diagnosed cases			0
' so far the team has used what are termed ' general source ' dogs , or strays that have been trained in scent detection methods			2
their plan is to now work with researchers at @entity185 's @entity184 program in the @entity186 to teach and imprint ' specific purpose ' dogs , or those specifically bred for detection			0
' if we do 300 samples with a diagnostic accuracy of 90 percent , that 's pretty hard to ignore , especially if it comes from @entity185 , which has been doing canine training for 25 years , ' added dr @entity32			0
' what we have done , no one has attempted to do , ' said lead author @entity32 ( pictured ) , who noted past studies showing trained dogs can tell the difference between various cancerous and non-cancerous tissues			2

@entity8 was trained to lie down after smelling thyroid cancer in urine
dogs have a sense of smell that is 10 times better than that of humans
on 34 patients , @entity8 gave 2 false positives and 2 incorrect ' all - clears '
*scientists* do n't yet know what dogs can smell when they detect cancer
finding out could help create an ' *electronic* nose ' to diagnose disease
