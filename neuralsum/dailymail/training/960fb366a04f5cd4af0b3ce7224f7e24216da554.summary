six months into his time at @entity2 and @entity3 already believes he has reason to be grateful			1
heading in to the second half of the @entity9 season , the @entity6 sees his team on the shoulder of title favourites @entity13 and @entity14			1
if @entity2 do n’t quite look like title contenders , they do resemble a team heading in the right direction			1
it was n’t always like this for @entity21 and his team , though			1
having taken only 13 points from their first 10 league games , @entity2 were struggling at the start of november and their manager thanked the club ’s supporters for showing patience he feels he would n’t have received at his previous clubs			1
i have never had the experience that when you lose or draw at home that the fans are still applauding for you , showing their belief in you			1
‘ in @entity51 , the white handkerchiefs would have come out			1
in @entity34 , they would have been whistling			1
in @entity52 , @entity53 , they would have been shouting for my “ friend ” @entity54 ( to replace me )			2
‘ here , they are applauding — they stand up and applaud			2
that ’s why i ’m thanking the fans because they were very important in my first six months			2
‘ early on , it was more weak than good			2
in spite of that , the fans have supported us always and in the right way			2
they always had belief in the players and their manager , and i think the main reason they have supported us is because of the fighting spirit of my team			2
‘ we were not always ahead in matches , but they have fought to the end and a lot of times with good success , so i think we can be satisfied about the points now — 36 points			2
’ @entity21 takes his @entity2 side to the @entity78 and @entity79 on @entity80 @entity81 has flourished in a number of roles under the @entity6 since his arrival as he looked ahead to a @entity85 that will see injured players returning , @entity21 has not ruled out a dip at the title			1
for that to happen , @entity13 and @entity14 would have to show uncharacteristic weakness but @entity21 is perhaps too experienced to rule anything out			2
in fact , he pointed out ahead of today ’s game at @entity79 that his first title in the @entity95 with @entity34 came from a similar position			0
‘ maybe you can see the @entity34 results of my first year , ’ he said			0
‘ i think that i have more points now with @entity2 than with @entity34 at the same time that year			1
but at the end of the season , we were champions			0
‘ but you can not compare the @entity105 league with the @entity107 league			0
it ’s apples with pears — that ’s a @entity6 expression			1
‘ it all depends on @entity13 and @entity14			0
they are the only teams who are above and you have seen @entity14 — in spite of a 2 - 0 result at half - time on sunday , it was 2 - 2 at the end			0
you have to compare always with this kind of club			0
@entity120 ( battling with @entity121 ) has found himself in among the goals again @entity2 are also beginning to see the best of @entity125 striker @entity124 ‘ but in our last three games — @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 — that should be nine points in my opinion			1
then , we have four points more and then only six points behind			0
‘ it ’s not always that the best team is winning and that ’s also nice in football i think			0
‘ i could not predict that @entity14 , at home , allows @entity140 — last , or one of the last on the table — to come back			0
but when i read it , it was true			0
’ @entity2 are unbeaten now in nine matches , a run that has moved them up the table			1
a 2 - 1 home win against @entity79 formed part of that run , with @entity2 hanging on at the end of that game under pressure from @entity154 ’ team			1
@entity21 moved to praise referee @entity155 , who will take charge of the game at @entity79 @entity79 are in somewhat less consistent form at the moment , but @entity21 knows they will be highly motivated for a game that is likely to test @entity2 ’s physical durability in more ways than one			1
‘ i hope that my players are recovered , ’ @entity21 said			0
‘ we have now one and a half days more than between the matches against @entity128 and @entity129 , so i do n’t think that plays a role			0
‘ but i think the referee is the most important man on the pitch always in relation to tackles			0
he has to allow it or not			0
‘ we have @entity155 , i believe , and i think he is a very good referee			0

@entity2 currently sit third in the @entity9
the @entity174 resemble a side on the up under @entity3
but the @entity6 did *initially* find life tough at @entity178
