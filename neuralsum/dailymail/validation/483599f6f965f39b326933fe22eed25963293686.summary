with the expansion of the @entity2 from 16 to 24 teams for 2016 , there has never been a better opportunity for all four of the @entity5 to qualify for a big tournament			0
and after the fifth round of qualifiers this weekend , all have a strong chance of making it to @entity12 next summer			2
at the half - way point in the qualification campaign , we look at the story so far and assess the chances of each making it			2
@entity20 the story so far wales have enjoyed an excellent start to their campaign , with three wins and two draws putting them top of @entity26 the reformatting of the competition means that the top two from each group advance automatically to @entity12 2016 , while the third - placed side enter the play - offs			1
@entity33 celebrates after scoring a late free - kick in @entity20 ' 2 - 1 win over @entity36 @entity20 started sluggishly , requiring a late @entity33 free - kick to spare them from embarrassment against minnows @entity36 , before earning a credible goalless draw at home to @entity42 , who played at the @entity44 in @entity45			1
goals from @entity47 and @entity48 saw off @entity49 before a 0 - 0 draw away to @entity51 , on paper the strongest team in the group			1
on saturday , they went top following a 3 - 0 win against 10 - man @entity57			1
@entity60 's @entity59 put them ahead on the stroke of half - time before the sending off , and two @entity33 strikes made absolutely sure after the break			2
results : @entity36 1 @entity20 2 ; @entity20 0 @entity42 0 ; @entity20 2 @entity49 1 ; @entity51 0 @entity20 0 ; @entity57 0 @entity20 3 @entity59 celebrates his opening goal in the 3 - 0 win over @entity57 at the weekend wales are currently two points ahead of @entity57 in @entity26 though they have played one game more when did they last reach a major tournament ? you have to go all the way back to 1958 , when @entity20 reached the @entity44 in @entity74 , to find their one and only finals appearance			1
they came close to reaching @entity77 , but lost to @entity78 in a play - off			0
what 's still to come ? much now rests on their match with @entity51 , who are currently third , in @entity84 on june 12			0
if @entity87 's team can get something from that , they will be in a very strong position			0
september sees a visit to @entity49 and a home return with @entity57 , before the campaign concludes with a tricky trip to @entity42 and a final home game with @entity36			2
from here , there really is little excuse not to make it but @entity20 have come close before , only to agonisingly miss out			0
fixtures : june 12 - @entity20 vs @entity51 ; september 3 - @entity49 vs @entity20 ; september 6 - @entity20 vs @entity57 ; october 10 - @entity42 vs @entity20 ; october 13 - @entity20 vs @entity36 @entity33 was on target twice in @entity101 as @entity20 lifted themselves top of qualifying @entity26 @entity104 the story so far it was a case of hardest match first for the @entity108 , who mounted some stiff resistance away to @entity111 and even drew level through @entity113 before succumbing 2 - 1			1
a nervy 1 - 0 win over @entity115 at @entity116 followed before a fine performance earned a 2 - 2 draw in @entity119			1
@entity104 actually led in @entity120 after goals from @entity122 and @entity123 but were pegged back			0
but two wins from two home games - 1 - 0 against the @entity126 and 6 - 1 against @entity127 on sunday - have left @entity129 's side third , good enough for a play - off spot as it stands but just a point off the lead			1
results : @entity134 2 @entity104 1 ; @entity104 1 @entity115 0 ; @entity119 2 @entity104 2 ; @entity104 1 @entity126 0 ; @entity104 6 @entity127 1 @entity113 celebrates his goal to pull the @entity108 level in their opening match with @entity134 in @entity137 @entity122 fired home the winning goal at @entity140 as the @entity126 were beaten 1 - 0 @entity104 are currently third in @entity141 - enough to secure a place in the play - offs as it stands when did they last reach a major tournament ? in 1998 , @entity104 reached the @entity44 finals in @entity12 so a return there is very much on the cards			1
they have twice made the @entity152 finals previously , in 1992 and 1996			0
what 's still to come ? the next match , away to the @entity126 in @entity155 is absolutely key			0
if they win , they will establish a five - point gap over them			2
if they lose , @entity160 will leapfrog them			0
@entity104 have an advantage in that their remaining games against the strongest sides , @entity134 and @entity119 , come at home			1
they must take maximum points from their away trips to @entity115 and @entity127			0
but in the most competitive group of the lot , they have every chance of making it			0
fixtures : june 13 - @entity126 vs @entity104 ; september 4 - @entity115 vs @entity104 ; september 7 - @entity104 vs @entity134 ; october 8 - @entity104 vs @entity119 ; october 11 - @entity127 vs @entity104 @entity176 scored a hat - trick in @entity104 's 6 - 1 rout of @entity127 at @entity116 on sunday @entity179 the story so far it 's been an excellent campaign for @entity179 so far , with four wins out of five putting them second to @entity185 in @entity186 @entity188 's side have exceeded all expectations , starting off with a 2 - 1 win over @entity191 in @entity192 thanks to late goals from @entity194 and @entity195			1
goals from @entity197 and @entity195 saw off the @entity198 at home , before @entity200 and @entity195 secured a 2 - 0 win in @entity202 three days later			1
their only blip came in a 2 - 0 loss to @entity185 , but more @entity195 goals on sunday against @entity207 saw them return to form			2
results : @entity191 1 @entity179 2 ; @entity179 2 @entity198 0 ; @entity202 0 @entity179 2 ; @entity185 2 @entity179 0 ; @entity179 2 @entity207 0 @entity195 celebrates after scoring in @entity179 's 2 - 1 win over @entity191 in @entity192 @entity197 scores the first goal in @entity179 's 2 - 0 win over the @entity198 in october @entity179 are just one point behind leaders @entity185 in @entity186 at the mid-way point when did they last reach a major tournament ? @entity179 have never made a @entity152 and the last of their three @entity218 was back in 1986			1
what 's still to come ? the top two in the group , @entity179 and @entity185 meet next at @entity222			0
in september , it 's the @entity198 away and @entity191 at home			0
the campaign concludes with @entity202 in @entity226 and a tip to play @entity207 in @entity228			0
encouragingly for @entity179 , there is a gap of eight points between themselves and @entity207 in fourth , so there really is little excuse not to make it into the top three from here			0
fixtures : june 13 - @entity179 vs @entity185 ; september 4 - @entity198 vs @entity179 ; september 7 - @entity179 vs @entity191 ; october 8 - @entity179 vs @entity202 ; october 11 - @entity207 vs @entity179 @entity195 scored twice as @entity179 beat @entity207 2 - 1 at @entity222 on sunday @entity238 the story so far a perfect five from five for @entity241 's men , who are making qualification look like a breeze			1
they have a six - point lead over @entity246 in second and it would take a real calamity not to make it through from here			0
two @entity251 goals saw them to victory in @entity254 back in september and that was followed by a predictable crushing of @entity257			0
@entity258 curled home a free - kick winner in a tough game in @entity262 , before @entity246 were beaten 3 - 1 at @entity263 , with @entity258 and @entity251 ( 2 ) finding the net			2
friday night 's 4 - 0 win over @entity266 made this @entity268 's best start to a season ever , courtesy of goals from @entity258 , @entity251 , @entity270 and @entity271			1
results : @entity254 0 @entity268 2 ; @entity268 5 @entity257 0 ; @entity262 0 @entity268 1 ; @entity268 3 @entity246 1 ; @entity268 4 @entity266 0 @entity251 's two goals against @entity254 in @entity274 got @entity268 off to the perfect start @entity251 is the leading goalscorer in @entity277 qualifying with six in five games @entity268 have made a perfect start to @entity280 , with five wins out of five when did they last reach a major tournament ? regular qualifiers for both the @entity44 and @entity2 but normally falling well short of expectations			1
what 's still to come ? a victory away to @entity246 in @entity287 in june should just about secure @entity268 's place in the finals and , failing that , away trips to minnows @entity257 and @entity266 , plus home meetings with @entity254 and @entity262 should do it			2
@entity241 's men should really be aiming for a perfect record of 10 wins from 10			0
fixtures : june 14 - @entity299 vs @entity268 ; september 5 - @entity257 vs @entity268 ; september 8 - @entity268 vs @entity254 ; october 9 - @entity268 vs @entity262 ; october 12 - @entity266 vs @entity268 debutant @entity271 celebrates his maiden @entity268 goal in friday 's 4 - 0 win over @entity266			1

we *'ve* reached the mid-way point of qualifying for @entity277 in @entity12
@entity268 made it five wins from five with 4 - 0 win over @entity266 on friday
@entity20 boosted their chances with a 3 - 0 win away to @entity57
@entity104 thrashed @entity127 and remain behind @entity134 and @entity119
@entity179 have claimed four wins from five so far
