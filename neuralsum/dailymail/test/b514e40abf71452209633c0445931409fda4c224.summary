nearly half of the @entity2 public believe the @entity3 should become @entity4 when the @entity5 accedes to the throne			1
a new poll by @entity8 ahead of @entity9 and @entity11 's 10th wedding anniversary reveals that 49 per cent think @entity11 should take the traditional title of the wife of a reigning king , while 35 per cent believe she should be given a lesser title out of respect to @entity17 , @entity18 and 16 per cent were undecided			1
when the @entity5 and @entity11 became engaged in february 2005 , only 7 per cent of people polled by @entity8 thought @entity11 should one day be @entity4			1
but according to some legal experts , unless there is change in the law , @entity11 will technically become @entity4 no matter what title she actually uses			2
most people ( 42 per cent ) said they had neither a positive or negative impression of @entity11 , with 31 per cent saying they had a positive one and 23 per cent a negative one			2
but the survey of 1,830 people also showed that 44 per cent believed @entity11 was well prepared to be the wife of the reigning monarch , 13 per cent thought she was badly prepared and the remainder had no opinion or did not know			1
of those questioned , 50 per cent thought @entity11 had carried out her duties as @entity3 of @entity46 well - with 20 per cent saying she did this very well and 30 per cent fairly well			1
only 6 per cent thought she had done badly in the role			0
some 28 per cent had no opinion and 16 per cent did not know			0
@entity50 , research executive at @entity8 , suggested it was more a case of people becoming used to @entity11 , rather than a large surge in popularity			2
' the further we get from @entity17 's death , the less that will resonate in people 's minds			0
as soon as the public see something for years and years , they become more neutralised to the issue , ' she said			0
prince @entity9 , left , and @entity11 , right , are preparing to celebrate their tenth wedding anniversary figures from @entity8 in june last year showed 53 per cent thought @entity11 should one day become @entity4 , 32 per cent believed she should have a lesser title and 14 per cent did not know			1
but ms @entity50 said the slight decrease from 53 per cent to 49 per cent was not significant and part of a general small fluctuation			0
almost two fifths ( 39 per cent ) said they believed the @entity4 was happy with @entity11 's performance as the @entity3 , with only 9 per cent thinking the monarch was unhappy			2
regarding @entity9 , 29 per cent think he is performing his duties as @entity5 better than he did 10 years ago , while 7 per cent think he is performing his duties worse than a decade ago			0
but 27 per cent think he was already performing his duties well and there has been no difference during the 10 years and 12 per cent believe there is no difference and he is still performing his duties poorly .			0
