childhood obesity is fueling an asthma epidemic , experts have warned			0
previous studies have suggested expanding waistlines could boost childhood asthma cases			0
but scientists at @entity7 have now linked obesity to an increased risk of the respiratory disease			1
a study found the relative risk of asthma increased by 55 per cent for every extra unit of body mass index ( @entity16 )			1
a study by scientists at @entity7 has linked childhood obesity with rising asthma cases			1
file picture the incidence of asthma - a chronic condition caused by inflammation of the airways - has been rising steadily over the past few decades , with more than 1.1 million children in the @entity27 currently battling the disease			0
leading charity asthma @entity27 today welcomed the study			2
dr @entity31 , the charity 's director of research and policy said : ' this research shows that children with a high @entity16 are more likely to develop asthma and is in line with previous research linking obesity with asthma			1
' asthma in children is a complex condition , and more research is needed to find ways to prevent asthma attacks and tragic asthma deaths			0
' keeping your @entity16 within normal limits brings all sorts of health benefits and may help reduce the risk of children developing asthma			1
' latest figures show 18.9 per cent of children in year 6 aged 10 to 11 were obese and a further 14.4 per cent were overweight			0
of the children in reception aged four to five , latest figures suggest 9.3 per cent were obese and another 13.0 per cent were overweight			0
in total almost a third of 10 to 11 - year - olds and more than a fifth of four to five - year - olds were overweight or obese			0
although the underlying causes of asthma are not known some experts think obesity may be one of the causes			0
previous research had suggested a link between obesity and asthma but the new study published in @entity76 used both genetic information and observational data in order to assess whether @entity16 has a causal effect on asthma			2
the study found the relative risk of asthma increased by 55 per cent for every extra unit of body mass index ( @entity16 )			1
file picture the study looked at 4,835 children with asthma by the age of seven - and - a - half enrolled in the @entity92			0
a weighted genetic score based on 32 independent @entity16 - related dna sequence variations was calculated , and associations with @entity16 , fat mass , lean mass , and asthma were estimated			2
the research found that the genetic score was strongly associated with @entity16 , fat mass , and lean mass , and with childhood asthma , and that the relative risk of asthma increased by 55 per cent for every extra unit of @entity16			1
these findings suggest that a higher @entity16 increases the risk of asthma in mid-childhood , and that public health interventions designed to reduce obesity may also help to limit the global rise in asthma			1
there was also some evidence that body composition - lean body mass - influences asthma through pathways not related to obesity - induced inflammation			1
dr @entity121 said : ' environmental influences on the development of asthma in childhood have been extensively investigated in epidemiological studies , but few of these provide strong evidence for causality			0
' @entity16 in mid-childhood could help explain some of the increase in asthma risk toward the end of the 20th century , although the continued rise in obesity but with a slowing in the rise in asthma prevalence in some countries implies that other @entity140 - related factors are also likely to be important			2
