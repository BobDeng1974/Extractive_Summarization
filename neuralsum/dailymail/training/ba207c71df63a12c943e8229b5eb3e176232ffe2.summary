the @entity1 teams are currently embroiled in a bitter internal dispute as to the way forward regarding engines			1
following the introduction for this season of the 1.6 - litre turbo - charged power units , @entity5 have thoroughly dominated , claiming 15 of 16 poles , 13 race wins and nine one - twos			1
in the constructors ' championship , four of the top - six teams boast @entity5 ' power , whilst in the drivers ' campaign , eight of the top 11 have the @entity20 manufacturing giant behind them			1
@entity5 race to another one - two at the @entity23 @entity22 after dominating the sport this campaign @entity5 drivers @entity27 ( @entity28 ) and @entity29 have won 13 of 16 races between them it is why @entity5 are determined to block a requested unfreezing of the current regulations that would allow @entity34 and @entity35 to make gains and potentially close the gap			1
a vote is to be taken at a forthcoming @entity40 meeting , in which all 11 teams will be present , along with @entity40 supremo @entity42 , the @entity43 and race promoters , with unanimity required for any changes to come into force			2
mercedes and their customers - @entity49 , @entity52 , and from next year , @entity48 - are unwilling to co-operate			2
determined @entity5 motorsport boss @entity53 said : ' @entity1 needs stability			1
' it 's very easy coming from a position of force where we say our power unit is clearly the most competitive at the moment and then just block everything			0
but this is not the approach we have			0
@entity5 chief @entity53 ( r ) is understandably against changing the rules to allow rivals to close the gap ' we have rules and we have governance , and the governance is in place in order to avoid quick , knee - jerk decisions being made that upset stability , upset the commercial set - up			1
' i strongly believe you can not change rules in october for the following year just because you think they do n't suit you			2
' @entity80 team principal @entity79 , whose team enjoyed four years of title - winning success with @entity35 up until this season , feels @entity5 should ' not be afraid of competition '			1
@entity79 appreciates an unfreeze could even prove beneficial to @entity5 as there is the possibility of them developing a more powerful engine			1
however , @entity79 feels @entity35 and @entity34 should at least be given an opportunity to level the playing field , otherwise @entity5 will be virtually unbeatable again in 2015			1
' mercedes are doing a super job , ' said @entity79			2
@entity80 boss @entity79 ( r ) wants to level the playing field or face ' stagnation ' in the sport ' but it is healthy for @entity1 that @entity34 , @entity100 ( who return in 2015 as supplier to @entity103 ) and @entity35 should have the ability to close the gap otherwise we are going to end up in a very stagnant position			1
' it is a bigger issue than just about the teams			0
it is about what is right for the sport , what is right for the fans			0
' it is easy to take a self - interest position , but when you look at what is the right thing for @entity1 , it is to have competition			0
' we need to be big enough to say let 's open it a little bit and let 's be responsible on costs - so there is no cost impact for customer teams - but have that competition			2
' so we 'll see what the outcome of the @entity133 vote is			0
' @entity43 are in support , @entity135 are in support			0
obviously the @entity139 teams are in support , so we 'll see what that holds in approximately a month 's time			0
' @entity40 supremo , pictured with @entity145 ( @entity28 ) , will attend the @entity40 to decide on changes from @entity34 's perspective , team principal @entity147 said : ' thinking of frozen engines , this is not @entity1			2
' so i agree with @entity152			0
now we have the majority of the votes to move ahead on the idea to unfreeze the engine			0
' let 's see what 's going to happen during the @entity40 meeting			0

mercedes have dominated after switch to @entity165 - charged engines
rival teams have requested unfreezing of regulations to allow the likes of @entity34 , @entity100 and @entity35 to close the gap
@entity5 chief @entity53 is *unsurprisingly* against changing the rules
@entity80 chief @entity79 wants to *prevent* sport becoming ' stagnated '
