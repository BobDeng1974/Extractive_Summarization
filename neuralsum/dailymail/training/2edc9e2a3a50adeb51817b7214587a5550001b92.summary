obesity is a ‘ slow - motion car crash ’ which is threatening to bankrupt the @entity2 , according to its chief executive			1
@entity5 said the problem is now more deadly than smoking and causing millions to suffer life - long illness and disability			1
he also revealed that – absurdly – the @entity2 is spending far more on drastic weight loss surgery than trying to prevent the problem in the first place			1
a quarter of adults and a fifth of children are now considered obese and the rates have almost doubled in 20 years			1
the @entity2 is spending far more on drastic weight loss surgery than trying to prevent the problem in the first place , its chief executive , @entity5 , has revealed and figures show the @entity2 spends anywhere between £ 5 billion and £ 9 billion a year treating obese patients and related complications such as diabetes			1
next month , mr @entity5 will publish a set of plans to tackle the problem which will see the @entity2 and private firms urged to do more to help staff lose weight			1
doctors and nurses will be encouraged to be healthy role models for patients and hospitals told to ban junk food from canteens			0
@entity2 trusts and private companies will also be urged to help staff lose weight by holding slimming classes , running clubs or just providing bike racks at work			1
mr @entity5 , who took up post last april , said : ‘ obesity is the new smoking , and it represents a slow - motion car crash in terms of avoidable illness and rising health care costs			1
‘ if as a nation we keep piling on the pounds around the waistline , we 'll be piling on the pounds in terms of future taxes needed just to keep the @entity2 afloat			0
’ addressing a conference hosted by @entity57 in @entity58 , he added : ‘ it 's bizarre that we are spending more nationally on bariatric surgery than we are on implementing at scale evidence - based programmes to prevent diabetes			2
‘ if we are serious about this then between @entity63 and @entity57 we are going to have to switch some of our investment - not having futile arguments about who is paying for what			0
he added : ‘ there is a danger we are sleepwalking into an unhealthy future			0
‘ the @entity2 is not a national role model when it comes to supporting staff to stay healthy			2
only a third of trusts give support to lose weight			2
mr @entity5 also criticised @entity79 which encourages customers to buy supersized bars of chocolate for reduced rates alongside their magazine or newspaper			1
referring to own experience at a branch at @entity90 ’s @entity89 station yesterday ( @entity91 ) morning , he added : ‘ they did n't say would you like a banana with that they said how about the chocolate ? ' the proposals unveiled next month are expected to call for companies to be offered tax incentives by the government to encourage staff to be healthier			0
a quarter of adults and a fifth of children are now considered obese and the rates have almost doubled in 20 years			1
this could mean they are given tax relief on national insurance if they install gyms , provide healthy food in canteens or arrange running clubs at lunchtime			0
hospitals and gp organisations will also be told to lead by example by offering fitness classes , support for staff trying to lose weight and by banning junk food			2
mr @entity5 is also understood to be in favour of companies offering financial incentives for staff to lead healthier lifestyles			1
he personally benefitted from such a scheme offered by his former company @entity130 , a private healthcare firm based in @entity132 , the @entity133			0
mr @entity5 , 48 , was able to lose three stone he had put on through an unhealthy @entity133 lifestyle partly thanks to incentives which offer employees reduced health insurance for meeting certain goals			1
other companies provide shopping vouchers to staff for losing weight or maintaining their blood pressure within the healthy range			0
researchers estimate that the @entity2 spends £ 5 billion annually treating obesity although this does n’t include the £ 9 billion annual bill for type 2 diabetes			2
@entity150 added that obesity is now more deadly than smoking and causing millions to suffer life - long illness and disability			1
and last year , the health service carried out 9,336 weight loss operations which typically cost between £ 5,000 and £ 15,000 a time , depending on the procedure			2
this means that based on an average cost per operation of £ 10,000 , the @entity2 spends nearly £ 100 million a year on weight loss surgery			1
mr @entity5 also wants local councils to use lessons learned by @entity163 where fast food chains are forced to display the calorie content of their products			2
the city ’s mayor , @entity167 , also attempted to ban the sale of supersized fizzy drinks last year although the law was thrown out by judge after the food industry appealed			0
@entity174 , chief executive of @entity175 , said obesity was the ‘ greatest public health emergency we face today			0
; ‘ the @entity180 ’s obesity rate is worryingly high and this has fuelled the massive rise we have seen in type 2 diabetes over the last couple of decades			0
‘ we are now in a position where diabetes accounts for 10 per cent of the entire @entity2 budget and if things carry on as they are it will bankrupt our healthcare system			0
’ @entity190 , chief executive of @entity57 , the government agency responsible for tackling obesity said : ’ he rightly highlighted the health and economic costs to society if as a nation we do not act now			0
‘ his focus on reducing obesity in the @entity2 workforce and limiting high fat and sugary foods in hospitals is especially important as they are role models for the public			0
