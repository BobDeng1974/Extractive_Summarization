bad steer : @entity1 , 65 , spent four years building @entity2 and hoped it would be the first vessel to complete a 3,600 - mile journey unaided a retired scientist spent four years building a toy boat he hoped would be the first to cross the @entity7 unaided - only to see it crash after six miles			1
@entity1 , 65 , waded into the sea in his trousers to launch @entity2 from @entity11 , @entity12 , on a 3,600 - mile journey to the @entity14 but the four - foot vessel sailed just six miles in seven hours before crashing into the @entity16 off the western tip of the @entity18			1
the 30lb boat , which has a top speed of just three knots , was constructed for less than £ 450 in mr @entity1 's games room in @entity23 , @entity24			1
it features solar panels on the deck that power a gps receiver , a small computer , and a turbo , which control the metre - high sails and rudder			1
mr @entity1 tracked the journey on the internet from a laptop after his boat set sail at 11.30am , but watched in horror as winds carried the boat straight into the rocks			1
he then lost contact with @entity2 at 6.45pm after the motion of the waves repeatedly bashed it against the rocks , breaking the onboard gps			0
the former senior scientist for @entity49 now hopes a member of the public will be able to rescue the boat so he can try again			2
he said : ' it was always going to be tough so i am not too downhearted			0
' hopefully somebody will find @entity56 and return her to us so we can give her a quick dusting down and send her back on her way			0
' she made good progress for the first two hours but then we noticed she was heading straight for the @entity16 , where she is wrecked			2
' the repeated bashing against the rocks has unfortunately broken the gps receiver			0
it ’s possible water has got on board			0
' seafaring adventure : the 1.3 - metre boat only managed seven hours before crashing into the @entity16 off the western tip of the @entity18 tiny craft : the 30lb boat , which has a top speed of just three knots , was constructed for less than £ 450 in mr @entity1 's games room he added : ' if we had launched her just a few hundred yards further west or half an hour earlier she would have probably missed the @entity16 and be well on her way now			1
' if the boat had survived the six - month journey to @entity81 , it would have been the first robotic boat to complete the transatlantic trip			1
the technology should have worked to keep the 10kg boat on a a pre-defined route , mapped out by mr @entity1			1
he started work on his project four years ago , assisted by six friends called the @entity91 , one of whom appeared on @entity94 programme @entity92			0
challenge : the 65 - year - old had hoped to make history by building the first unmanned vessel to cross the @entity7 labour of love : mr @entity1 has spent four years crafting the four foot boat at a cost of around £ 450 the boat has previously already sailed 5,000 miles , albeit in the comparatively still waters of @entity105 near @entity106			1
he said before the launch : ' it will be a tough trip with lots of obstacles to trip us up along the way			0
' the boat will have to negotiate large waves , strong winds and even curious dolphins			2
' however , our research and testing will hopefully give us a fighting chance			0
' mr @entity1 made prototypes using items he had bought on auction website @entity122			2
a model of cartoon character @entity56 was fitted to the front of the boat			2
resilient : @entity1 's craft has already sailed around 5,000 miles , albeit on the still waters of @entity105 near @entity106 construction : @entity1 has been helped by a team of friends , including a veteran of @entity94 's @entity92 it was due to head west along the @entity135 from the @entity12 coastline , south towards the @entity137 to catch the trade winds , then to the @entity139 and on to the @entity14			1
a team from @entity141 attempted the first transatlantic crossing in september 2010 setting sail from @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146			2
but the team lost its track of the craft off the north west coast of @entity146			0
the challenge has been attempted three times since 2010 , with all three attempts failing			0
three more attempts have been registered for this year .			0

@entity1 , 65 , hoped to sail his four foot long boat 3,600 miles to @entity14 shores
his solar - powered craft set off from @entity11 , @entity12 , but crashed on @entity18 just hours later
