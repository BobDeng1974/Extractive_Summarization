by @entity0 for @entity1 the way that couples interact with a doll filled with rice can predict future parenting behavior , a new study has found			1
researchers at @entity9 asked 182 couples in the third trimester of pregnancy to play with the doll - consisting of pajamas filled with 7lbs of rice and a green fabric head - treating it as though it were their future child			1
the participants exhibited similar behavior when they were videotaped interacting with the doll , and then caring for their own baby nine months after giving birth			1
baby talk : the way that couples interacted with a rice - filled doll ( pictured ) predicted future parenting behavior in a study at @entity9 ' the extent to which couples support or undermine each other ’s interactions with the doll predicts their co-parenting behavior a year later , ' @entity29 , a professor of human sciences who co-authored the study with doctoral student @entity31 , said in a press release			1
according to dr @entity29 , some of the couples had a positive attitude , complimenting each other on their parenting style with both the doll and the child			1
' with the doll they might say " you ’re going to be such a great dad			0
" after the birth of the baby , their talk would be very similar : " you ’re such a natural , " ' she said			0
however , those who expressed negativity around the doll were also critical of each other when the baby arrived			2
' they might say things like “ you ’re not going to hold the real baby like that , are you ? ” ' she said			0
the research took place in the couples ' homes , where an assistant acting as a nurse presented the doll to each couple			2
child 's play : researchers asked 182 couples in the third trimester of pregnancy to play with the doll - and found that they behaved similarly with their real baby one year later during each five minute session , the participants played with the doll alone , then with their partner , and then discussed the experience			1
dr @entity29 tells @entity1 that some couples laughed and ' looked a little embarrassed ' when they were initially presented with the doll			2
but , she says , ' for the most part , the silliness faded and they were able to get into the situation and take it seriously			0
' researchers later viewed the footage to examine the expectant couples ' levels of cooperation , playfulness and family warmth , as well as the structure of the play and the extent to which they showed intuitive parenting behaviors			1
the study 's authors hope that their research will help resolve potential conflicts for future parents			0
' when parents fight and undermine each other ’s parenting , the child suffers ' ' when parents fight and undermine each other ’s parenting , the child suffers , ' ms @entity31 said , adding : ' if we can identify couples who may have problems with their co-parenting before their baby is even born , we may be able to intervene			1
' dr @entity29 says that even though she believes that the co-parenting relationship begins to develop before childbirth , she was still surprised by the study 's results			0
' it still amazes me that five minutes of play with a doll can predict co-parenting behavior with the real infant one year later , ' she says			0
' the association between prenatal and postnatal behavior is modest in size , but it is definitely there			0
i plan to use this doll - play situation in my future research , because i think it really provides a unique opportunity to watch families develop from the earliest stages , ' she adds			2
the study was conducted as part of the @entity141 , which is examining how dual - earner couples adjust to becoming parents .			0

researchers at @entity9 asked 182 couples in the third trimester of pregnancy to play with the doll , pretending it was their future child
