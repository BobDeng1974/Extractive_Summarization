between the bad behaviour and the bad advice , @entity0 is not exactly endearing himself to potential suitors right now			1
hippy crack and shisha pipes , mixed in with accusations of greed after being encouraged by his agent to reject @entity11 ’s offer of close to £ 100,000 - a - week , might not be quite enough to send rival clubs running			1
after all , as @entity11 know only too well , you can bite and racially abuse opponents and still secure a move to @entity16			1
but the evidence is sure to be a concern when the world ’s richest clubs assess the character as much as the class of an individual before parting with the £ 40million upwards @entity11 will demand to secure the services of a player like @entity0			1
@entity11 players @entity0 and @entity27 ( left ) have been pictured smoking a shisha pipe this is the second time @entity0 has been pictured smoking from a shisha pipe in the past few days the recent images of @entity0 will be a concern to clubs considering parting with £ 40million to sign the star @entity36 secured a move to @entity16 despite being involved in a number of incidents on the pitch @entity42 football would appear to have yet another flawed talent , another player seemingly lacking the wit to make best use of the ability he has been blessed with			1
there is a reason why we rarely see the finest players on the planet caught in as compromising a position as @entity0 found himself on monday night			1
becoming as good as @entity56 or @entity57 — @entity58 even — requires more than ability alone			0
it requires the kind of professionalism and dedication that seems to be absent in @entity42 players too often photographed smoking or indulging in legal highs			2
as the latest photographs show , this is not an isolated incident and he will be lectured on the dangers of nitrous oxide when he meets with @entity73 tomorrow			1
it is more of a health issue than an image issue for @entity11 ’s manager , as @entity0 did at least opt for the privacy of his own home to suck on a balloon filled with nitrous oxide — unlike @entity83 ’s @entity82 , for instance			1
but @entity73 will also suggest to the unsettled 20 - year - old that he needs to select his friends more carefully given the emergence of the video in the first place			1
@entity27 was also pictured smoking shisha with @entity0 in fresh pictures that will further embarrass @entity11 it appears that @entity11 stars @entity0 and @entity27 had a shisha pipe apiece and were also drinking @entity95 @entity0 celebrates after scoring @entity11 's opening goal in monday night 's 2 - 0 win over @entity98 becoming as good as @entity56 ( right ) or @entity57 ( left ) requires more than just ability alone he should also heed the warnings of other talented players who have run into such trouble , like @entity103 and @entity104			1
of course , it will not be the first time @entity73 has questioned @entity0 over the company he keeps			1
he has publicly criticised the player ’s agent for his role in the @entity113 international ’s ongoing contract saga — and with some justification given how badly things have been handled			0
but @entity73 ’ criticism of @entity117 is limited to the issues over the contract because he recognises the agent as someone who , at times , has had a positive influence on a young man whose life has not been without its problems			1
@entity117 is credited to some extent with the fact that @entity0 actually gives his manager few concerns when he is at work			1
he is said to be polite and courteous to the staff , is always punctual and applies himself in training and matches and generally has a smile on his face			0
@entity11 manager @entity73 was due to speak to @entity0 to remind him of his responsibilities @entity27 and @entity0 were wearing casual clothing and pictured inhaling from the lit shisha pipe ( bottom right ) @entity141 is a water pipe in which flavoured tobacco is roasted with charcoal			1
the tobacco smoke passes through a water chamber and is inhaled deeply and slowly			0
the flavoured tobacco smells sweet , making it an enjoyable and relaxing experience , according to enthusiasts			0
despite the smoke passing through water , all the risks of smoking a regular cigarette are present – including respiratory and heart diseases , as well as cancer			2
during an hour - long @entity141 smoking session , it has been estimated the smoke inhaled is the equivalent of between 100 and 200 cigarettes			0
for all the uncertainty over his future , @entity73 and the player have managed to maintain a healthy working relationship			1
the relationship between @entity117 and @entity0 is more personal than the typical agent - player dynamic			1
they appear to be business partners judging by the company details of @entity170			0
while @entity117 has 80 per cent of the equity , the remaining 20 per cent is divided between @entity0 and @entity173 ’s @entity172			1
but @entity117 has an almost paternal relationship with @entity0 , with the player affectionately addressing him as ‘ @entity176 ’			1
clearly , @entity0 needs that kind of guidance			1
his team - mates might joke that he has ‘ more kids than caps ’ when he admits to one daughter — he occasionally brings two - year - old @entity183 into training — but denies a second child			0
but @entity0 ’s own childhood was a difficult one			2
born in @entity188 and raised for the first five years of his life in one of the more deprived districts of @entity192 , he would eventually leave with his mother to live on one of the toughest estates in north @entity196 in the shadow of @entity198			0
back in @entity188 , when he was still only nine , the father he claims never to have known was murdered , reportedly shot dead in some kind of gangland ambush			0
in @entity196 , @entity0 had to leave his primary school to attend @entity203 , a school in @entity205 for children with behavioural problems			2
‘ as a young kid i had anger issues , ’ @entity0 admitted in a recent interview , although teachers at the school could not speak highly enough of him			2
while @entity212 once had to warn @entity0 he could end up ‘ in prison ’ if he failed to change his ways , he remembers someone who was ‘ amazingly intelligent in so many ways ; a brilliant thinker ’			2
@entity0 was pictured on social media smoking a shisha pipe in a story published over the weekend @entity0 was also filmed apparently inhaling nitrous oxide - known as ' hippy crack ' @entity212 told the @entity223 two years ago that he would walk @entity0 and his classmates to look at the building site that would soon become the new @entity198			1
it proved a source of inspiration , with @entity229 recruiting him when he was 10			0
@entity230 , academy director during @entity0 ’s time at @entity229 , remembers a young player whose ‘ mentality ’ was ‘ his strongest attribute ’			2
he also described him as ‘ a coach ’s dream ’			0
@entity230 also praised @entity0 ’s mother — @entity239 is a nurse — for her positive influence			2
when @entity0 moved to @entity11 at 15 he lived in digs with the couple he warmly refers to as his ‘ house parents ’			1
eventually , however , @entity239 moved to @entity244 , living with her son until around a year ago			0
judging by recent events , she might need to move back in			0
@entity117 should think very carefully before he makes his next move , because the last few weeks have amounted to a @entity249 disaster			0
@entity0 acknowledges young @entity229 supporters - the @entity11 star joined the @entity253 club at the age of 10 there is nothing wrong with trying to secure the best deal possible for a player			1
particularly when @entity117 can point to the fact that , right now , a player of @entity0 ’s value to @entity11 is earning roughly £ 6m - a - year less than @entity262 ; £ 35,000 - a - week compared with £ 150,000 - a - week			1
there was also nothing wrong with activating the trigger clause in @entity0 ’s contract , which entitled him to renegotiate his deal after a number of appearances			2
by the end of last year , @entity11 actually thought they had reached an agreement at just shy of £ 100,000 - a - week			1
and if @entity0 looks at @entity271 and questions why there is still such a significant shortfall , he probably has a point			2
such a reaction would be no different to other marquee players at top clubs when news emerges of a colleague landing a big deal			0
managers even joke of a queue forming at their office door			0
@entity0 has cause for complaint because he is a wonderful footballer			2
the academy staff at @entity11 consider him the most exciting winger to have come through the club ’s system and @entity73 has described him as the finest young player in @entity291			1
@entity292 was so impressed he unleashed him at last summer ’s @entity293 in @entity294 , aged just 19			0
it is simply the way @entity117 and @entity0 have gone about their business off the field that has been so unpalatable			2
the unauthorised interview with the @entity301 ; an article in the @entity304 magazine when he said it was an ambition to have his own song ‘ from the @entity306 ’			0
the @entity306 duly obliged on monday night against @entity98 , informing the scorer of their opening goal that his ‘ agent is a * * * * ’			0
@entity0 says it is not about the money , that it is about playing @entity315 football and winning trophies			2
but do n’t activate that trigger clause and make out you want a new contract if the real intention is to move to @entity321 , @entity322 or @entity173			0
do n’t take the dispute into the public arena if it ’s not a pay rise you ’re after , but a transfer			0
@entity0 celebrates with @entity27 after scoring in monday 's @entity328 match at @entity329 against @entity98 @entity27 pictured during monday night 's win over @entity98 , which kept @entity11 in the top four chase if @entity117 ’s intention is to take @entity0 away from @entity11 this summer , the player is not making his job easy right now			1
alarmed by recent events , @entity173 are already thought to be going cold on the idea			0
the agent will tell potential suitors not to read too much into the photographs , that @entity0 is a good @entity340 boy who says his prayers every night and rarely , if ever , touches alcohol			1
he drives a @entity343 ; an expensive but sensible car			0
he was bright enough to buy a house when he was only 18 and generous enough to buy his mother a ‘ beautiful house ’ back in @entity188			0
@entity117 might also point out that the mistakes he has made are typical of any other 20 - year - old			0
trouble is , @entity0 is not like any other 20 - year - old			2
he is a gifted footballer who needs to ask himself a couple of important questions			0
does he want to be the best ? and if so , is he prepared to make the sacrifices ?			0

new pictures show @entity0 and @entity27 with shisha pipes
the @entity11 pair are dressed in casual clothing and have a pipe each
pictures emerged last week of @entity11 star *sterling* smoking shisha
footage also emerged of him inhaling nitrous oxide from a balloon
the pictures create a fresh problem for @entity11 boss @entity73
the images will be a concern for any potential suitors of the @entity11 star
