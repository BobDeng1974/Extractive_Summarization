@entity0 continued to pay @entity1 after he was convicted of rape			1
football clubs can terminate a player ’s contract , sacking them on the grounds of gross misconduct if they are found guilty of a criminal offence			2
but @entity9 understands that officials at @entity11 honoured the remaining few months of @entity1 ’ £ 20,000 - per - week contract after he was imprisoned in april 2012 for raping a 19 - year - old girl			1
@entity0 continued to pay @entity1 after he was convicted of rape @entity1 was jailed in 2012 , but the @entity15 honoured the remaining months of his contract at @entity11 @entity1 ’ contract ran out at the end of june that year and the club announced he had been released with a number of other players that summer			1
but the @entity23 international forward actually received his july salary too ; something that a club is contractually obliged to do when releasing a player who has not , at that stage , found another club			0
when asked on thursday night why @entity0 did not immediately respond to his rape conviction by sacking @entity1 , a spokesman for the @entity33 club refused to comment			1
blades boss @entity34 says it is up to his employers to decide whether @entity1 can return to the club but the stance the club took over their former striker perhaps gives the best indication yet that they are prepared to welcome him back to @entity11 once he is released , as expected , from jail on friday			1
publicly the club have not revealed their position on the future of @entity1 , insisting they have not yet made a decision			1
earlier this week manager @entity34 said it was up to his employers to decide			0
it is a situation that continues to divide opinion			0
while professional footballers ’ association chief executive @entity48 insists @entity1 , now 25 , should be allowed to return to work , @entity0 came under yet more pressure to reject @entity1 on thursday when deputy prime minister , @entity51 , joined the debate			2
@entity53 chief executive @entity48 insists @entity1 should be allowed to return after serving his time in an interview with @entity56 mr @entity51 , who is a @entity57 mp , said : ‘ i think the owners need to think really long and hard about the fact that when you take a footballer on , you are not taking just a footballer these days , you are also taking on a role model			2
‘ you are taking on a role model , particularly for a lot of young boys who look up to their heroes on a football pitch in a team like that , and he has committed a very serious crime			0
‘ it is for the football club to decide , but i really do think that footballers these days , they are major public figures who have a public responsibility to set an example for other people			0
deputy prime minister @entity51 has questioned whether @entity1 should have a future in the game @entity1 was a full @entity83 international before he got put behind bars ‘ i ’m sure that will weigh heavily in the decisions made by the owners of @entity0			2
rape is an incredibly serious offence , an unbelievably serious offence			0
' he has done his time but i just do n’t believe that the owners of a football club can somehow wish away the fact that that has happened			0
