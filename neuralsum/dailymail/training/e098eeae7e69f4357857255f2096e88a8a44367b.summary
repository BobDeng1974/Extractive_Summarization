@entity1 goalkeeper @entity0 was the busiest goalkeeper in @entity3 history on tuesday night as @entity4 hammered at his goal but there was no way the stopper was going to be beaten			1
the @entity9 was forced to make 16 saves - the most in a @entity3 game since records began in 1966 - and was in inspired form			1
nothing was going to get past him as the stopper produced one of the greatest @entity9 goalkeeping displays in @entity3 history			0
single - handedly forcing the tie into extra-time , whatever @entity4 threw at him , the 35 - year - old was up to the task ; save after save after save			0
safe hands : @entity0 became the busiest goalkeeper in @entity3 history in @entity26 on tuesday glove affair : @entity0 made more saves ( 16 ) than any keeper at the @entity3 since records began brick wall : @entity0 's shot - stopping capabilities and command of his area forced the game into extra-time with the attacking talents of @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 all peppering his goal @entity0 was in the form of his life and showed his prowess between the sticks			1
on the hour mark , @entity0 's shutout became intriguing as his @entity49 team - mate @entity48 was introduced for the @entity50			2
would the @entity52 's know - how of how the @entity54 stopper operates see @entity4 take lead ? no chance			2
@entity48 found himself clean through on goal minutes after coming on but was denied by the left boot of @entity0 as the keeper stayed big , stopping everything that was thrown at him			0
commanding his goal with authority , @entity0 was often left with little help from the back - line employed to protect him and had to bellow at his team - mates on more than one occasion			0
unfortunately @entity1 's one - man show could n't go on forever and @entity4 finally broke the deadlock as former @entity70 man @entity69 turned cleverly to create space for himself in the box and struck the ball past @entity0 and into the far corner of the net			1
after acting like a brick wall for the entire opening ninety minutes , @entity0 was helpless to stop @entity4 from doubling their advantage as @entity80 , who played with the keeper at @entity82 last term , powerfully curled the ball inside the post			2
following the match , the performance of @entity9 's @entity87 - perhaps one of the best goalkeeping displays in recent @entity3 history - had clearly impressed @entity4 captain @entity89 who tweeted : ' two words : @entity0			1
' @entity94 leave it late again no way past : @entity0 denies @entity49 team - mate @entity48 with his left foot late in the second half finally beaten : @entity0 is helpless to deny @entity69 who fired home to give @entity4 the lead super sub : @entity4 striker @entity80 unleashes an exquisite finish to double @entity4 's advantage dejected : @entity0 's heroics were to no avail as @entity4 emerged 2 - 1 victors and progressed from the last - 16 meanwhile , @entity1 manager @entity108 paid tribute to @entity0 and said : ' what @entity0 played tonight was just phenomenal , outstanding - he kept us in that game for a long time			1
we are proud to have him with us			0
' it was an absolutely amazing match tonight and you can give him the biggest compliment in the world			0
' after some sterling saves and one of the performances of his career , it 's a shame @entity0 had to be on the losing side as his @entity3 dream came to an end			0
at the age of 35 , @entity0 may have one last summer tournament in him - and who could deny him that chance having performed so courageously for the @entity129			0
now though , after a well - deserved break , @entity0 's focus will return to club action with @entity49 and @entity49 supporters will hope their main man between the sticks can take his @entity3 form long into the new @entity138 campaign			2
