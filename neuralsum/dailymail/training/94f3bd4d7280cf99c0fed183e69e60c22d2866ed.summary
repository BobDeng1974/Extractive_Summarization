by @entity0 published : 18:20 est , 8 november 2013 @entity2 : 18:41 est , 8 november 2013 to the public , @entity3 , who has died aged 85 , was @entity6 ’s mr @entity5			1
the man with the @entity9 accent , herringbone overcoat and upside - down spectacles , usually seen shivering outside 10 @entity12			1
but long before he stepped in front of the television camera , @entity3 was a @entity16 old - timer			1
‘ @entity19 , @entity20 … ’ was how the satirical magazine @entity17 began his spoof bulletins			1
his @entity22 puppet had a @entity24 hairdo and prince @entity26 ’s ears			1
but although @entity3 was caricatured , he was also trusted by the public to tell things straight			1
on air , he kept his life - long @entity31 leanings in check			1
' hondootedly , @entity20 ' , was how @entity17 began its satirical bulletins by @entity3 , who has died mr @entity3 , a household name with his distinctive accent and glasses , even became a @entity22 puppet as political editor of the @entity41 from 1981 to 1992 , he had a seat in the @entity5 cockpit during one heck of a ride			1
from dawn ’s radio slots to television ’s late - night news shows , there he was , squawking down the microphone , peering into the camera lens like a man peeking through a keyhole			1
but the unrelenting hours took their toll			1
he had health problems , particularly with his heart			1
yesterday , @entity59 led tributes , describing @entity3 as ‘ someone who has contributed so much to @entity63 political life ’ and a ‘ titan at the @entity41 , an extraordinary broadcaster ’			1
@entity66 said : ‘ my generation grew up watching @entity3			1
he conveyed the drama and importance of politics			1
’ and what big stories @entity3 covered : the @entity72 and its aftermath ; the loopiness of @entity76 ’s @entity75 ; the miners ’ strike – and then the downfall of @entity80 – that scintillating drama in the autumn of 1990 when the parliamentary conservative party took revenge on its bossy @entity85			1
described as humble , @entity3 never stooped to the left - wing bias which existed in much of the @entity41 as a very green sketchwriter , i got to know @entity3 a little at that time			2
he was generous with his time			2
he never let mrs @entity90 shout at him but he never gave her cause to do so			2
though it was open knowledge that he did not share her politics , he reported her views with interest and respect			2
her own suspicion of the ‘ @entity99 ’ was no secret			2
but @entity41 bias had its roots at @entity103 , not in the reporting of political editor @entity3			1
once , @entity106 mps practically assaulted @entity3 in the @entity108 lobby when @entity110 ’s @entity109 went on its periodic @entity112 sallies , but they had the wrong target			2
mrs @entity20 realised that @entity3 was a grown - up surveyor of the political scene			2
he had lived a bit and he had a newsman ’s acceptance of events			2
not for him such cheap ruses as the ‘ rabbit punch ’ question – when an interviewer tries to shock a politician with a startling question			2
nor did @entity3 have much time for the political correctness which has since afflicted the @entity41			2
he was an @entity127 , after all			2
@entity128 , son of an electrical engineer , was born in 1927 and educated at @entity9 ’s @entity130			2
he joined the @entity131 in 1945 , covering industrial and political stories			0
in 1956 he joined the @entity133 and reported trade union matters			0
@entity3 hoped to become editor of @entity133 in 1975 but his flinty @entity137 ways – not least his realistic view of @entity139 – were incongenial to the @entity140 who were by then in the vanguard			1
so he moved to the @entity143 , where he became deputy editor			1
he joined the @entity41 only after that paper was bought by industrialist @entity146			0
his @entity41 colleague @entity147 recalled yesterday : ‘ i did n’t think we should employ him as the on - air political editor because people would simply find it too difficult to understand his accent			1
today 's generation of politicians and journalists grew up watching mr @entity3 reporting on life in @entity5 ‘ mercifully they ignored my advice completely			0
of all the massive errors of judgment i ’ve made , that was probably my biggest			0
he turned out to be a great star			0
people related to him as a warm and decent human being			0
they could see he was a decent man			0
’ in his newspaper years , @entity3 was a committed @entity31 man			0
he suppressed editorial criticism of @entity31 figures such as @entity172 , @entity173 or @entity174			0
despite his later image as an avuncular figure , @entity3 was a tough guy			0
at the @entity41 , in those days , there was a duty to abjure party bias			0
one of @entity3 ’s on - air catchphrases became ‘ it seems to me ’ – a line he used to indicate to viewers his descent into ( fact - based ) conjecture			0
like the best journalists , @entity3 was not afraid to say ‘ i do n’t know ’			0
this would normally be preceded by an @entity189 ‘ ach ’			0
@entity3 was a natural broadcaster and it was his good luck to become @entity41 political editor just when technology permitted more ‘ live ’ shots , accentuating the drama of politics			1
it was not just the @entity189 brogue that made him memorable			0
he had a tone of urgency combined with a gnarled provincial ’s perspective			0
though he worked at @entity5 he was not a metropolitan			0
obstinate : mr @entity3 reported on most of @entity20 's premiership and predicted her downfall , but he found her difficult to interview he will be remembered for his image but there was much more to him than that			0
he felt strongly about the scourge of unemployment			0
he understood that politics mattered			0
what @entity9 journalist of that era could not ? he must have been glad that he worked in the time before the mind - squeezing inanities of @entity217 and vox - pops and daytime ‘ two - ways ’ with @entity220			0
he would have been baffled that the @entity41 political programmes noted , let alone amplified , the likes of @entity222			0
@entity3 is survived by his wife @entity224 , four sons – @entity226 , a @entity228 sub-editor , @entity229 , @entity59 and @entity76 – and nine grandchildren			1
the @entity41 ’s current political editor , @entity231 , is a worthy successor			1
but elsewhere , today ’s @entity41 could do with more @entity232			0
on camera : mr @entity3 spent more than a decade reporting on politics for the @entity41 , but the punishing hours took their toll on the veteran broadcaster , particularly on his heart			1

caricatured and *jested* with , he was also trusted to tell things straight
he was a @entity16 veteran who served as deputy editor of the @entity143
tributes have come from @entity59 , @entity66 and @entity231
