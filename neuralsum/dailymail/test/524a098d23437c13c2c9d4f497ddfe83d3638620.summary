' 30 women have died at the hands of male partners this year so far			0
it might seem like long bow to draw but when there are vans driving around saying that a wife is attachment to screw in the bedroom and suggesting it ’s all right to kidnap a women , it is really making a subtle suggestion that women are only good for sex and getting housework done , ' she said			2
