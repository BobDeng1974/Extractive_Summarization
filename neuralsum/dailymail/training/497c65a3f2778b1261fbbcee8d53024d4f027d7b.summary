herculean : @entity0 as @entity1			1
he has portrayed the @entity3 detective since 1989 and wishes to film all of his adventures penned by @entity5 @entity5 could not stand @entity1			1
the little @entity3 detective with the waxed moustaches brought her fame and wealth , but she found him ‘ insufferable ’			1
the actor @entity0 , luckily for us , ca n’t get enough of the character			1
he has been playing @entity14 since 1989 , starting with 50 - minute adaptations of short stories — @entity5 was endlessly inventive , and wrote more than 30 novels and 50 short tales featuring the pompous little sleuth with the egg - shaped head			1
@entity0 has made no secret of his ambition to star as @entity14 in all the stories and the character has come to define his career			1
last night , the 13th season of @entity14 ( @entity28 ) opened with one of her last crime riddles , elephants can remember			1
it was not one of her better plots — the twist involves identical twins , a trick that was outlawed way back in 1929 when avid detective story fan monsignor @entity38 published the @entity39 ( they included : no @entity40 , only one secret passage per novel , and definitely no cheating with twins )			1
frankly , @entity45 is n’t one of the @entity48 ’s better titles , either			1
most things can remember , apart from goldfish			1
a cleverer title was hidden in the excellent script by @entity53 : a retired copper relayed some ancient gossip to @entity14 and reminded him , ‘ old sins have long shadows			1
’ but the elephant theme gave the set designers an excuse for extra fun			2
among the glorious clutter of @entity65 fabrics and props , from the garish rose wallpaper , to the gold tracery on the teacups , someone had placed an ivory monstrosity on @entity14 ’s windowsill : a tusk carved into a procession of elephants			2
@entity14 was as riotously egotistical as ever			2
@entity0 ’s genius is that he can deliver everything @entity5 found so exasperating , without becoming a caricature — he minces , he trots , he fusses , he talks endlessly of himself in the third person			1
partners against crime : @entity0 with @entity83 as lady sleuth @entity84 ‘ if @entity14 can be of any assistance he comes at once , toute suite , ’ he said			1
@entity83 , as the lady detective @entity84 , worked hard to match him			1
she has turned the original character , a bumbling scatterbrain who eats apples by the bagful in her bathtub , into a ghastly snob who investigates murders like a prefect at a girls ’ boarding school who suspects the third formers of smuggling cherry brandy into the dorms			2
it ’s a clever device — she makes @entity14 seem charming by comparison			2
and she gets results , sniffing out murder most foul in rural @entity109			2
fearful symmetry : @entity111 followed the plight of the majestic @entity114 tiger as one old scandal - monger tells her : ‘ in this part of the world , one either hunts or has affairs			2
’ affairs would be out of the question in eastern @entity123 , where blizzards blow for weeks and the temperature often falls below minus 30c			0
love of wildlife : @entity129 's enthusiasm for the beautiful creatures was infectious but hunting can be rewarding , when the quarry is tigers			0
presenter @entity129 , a former wildlife biologist who studied bengal tigers in @entity135 , brought real passion to @entity111 ( @entity137 ) last night , on the trail of the most magnificent predators on @entity140			0
fewer than 350 @entity114 tigers survive in the wild			0
more scientists have gone into space than have seen the animal in its natural habitat			0
‘ the @entity114 tiger stands a very real risk of becoming extinct , ’ she warned			0
and film of the tigers was brief in this first of two episodes			0
most of it came from hidden cameras in the forests north of @entity158 , amid snow - scenes and ravishing scenery that looked like a real - world @entity161			0
but @entity129 ’s excitement when the camera traps caught images of tigers was palpable			0
she squealed , gasped and shouted when a fleeting image ghosted across the frame			0
and she was determined to match the @entity169 scientists for stamina and hardihood , whether that was yomping through the snowdrifts , fighting to haul vehicles over the icy roads , or swigging @entity177 vodka			0
she was pop - eyed with horror after downing a shot of the fiery liquid			0
‘ how do you say “ that ’s strong ” in @entity169 ? ’ she croaked			0
with so little footage of the tigers , there was inevitably some padding			0
but @entity129 ’s genuine enthusiasm made every moment watchable .			0

author @entity5 found her most famous creation ' insufferable '
but @entity0 , who has portrayed detective since 1989 , shows no sign of *waning*
