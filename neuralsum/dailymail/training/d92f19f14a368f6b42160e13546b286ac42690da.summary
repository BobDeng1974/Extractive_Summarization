by @entity0 for @entity1 a newspaper sales director who ' terrorised ' a shopkeeper and ‘ viciously ’ smashed up an off - licence has managed to get his conviction successfully wiped from @entity7 using the @entity9 ’s controversial ' right to be forgotten ' ruling			1
@entity10 and his older brother @entity11 , both from @entity12 , admitted causing affray in 2001 and were jailed for nine months and ordered to pay £ 300 in compensation			2
however , while the @entity18 case was widely reported in the media , the former newspaper sales boss has now managed to get record of his conviction wiped from the @entity22 ’s biggest search engine			1
@entity10 , a former newspaper sales director who was convicted of affray in 2001 , has successfully managed to get reports of his offence wiped from @entity7 's @entity22 search results under the ' right to be forgotten ' @entity10 , who was 30 at the time , and his brother had been on their way to watch @entity31 at @entity32 in the @entity34 area in february 2001 when they walked into the off - licence , removed @entity37 cameras and caused carnage – smashing up displays , throwing bottles of liquor and hurling a till to the ground			1
the men , who were part of a much larger group , also contributed to causing injury to shopkeeper @entity47 who was left needing stitches when a bottle hit him in the lip			0
the brothers were convicted after video footage taken outside the football ground identified them and was handed to police			0
while reports of their convictions remained published online for many years , they have now been wiped from the search engine , the @entity59 said , after @entity10 successfully used @entity7 ’s ' right to be forgotten ' form - which lets people apply to get themselves removed from search results			1
the ability to remove information from the site came into force in may after a landmark ruling by the @entity68 which said people were entitled to the ' right to be forgotten '			2
it means people can have @entity7 search results removed if they feel they tarnish their reputation			1
following @entity10 ’s successful application in getting his conviction wiped from the site , a disclosure notice now appears in search results for his name			1
hundreds of thousands of people have requested links are removed from @entity7 @entity22 since the @entity68 's ruling in may			1
people can apply for results to be removed if they feel they tarnish their reputation ‘ some results may have been removed under data protection law in @entity89 , ’ it states on @entity86			0
however , those using @entity86 see no such message and reports of @entity10 ’s conviction still appear on the site			2
since july 18 , more than 91,000 applications have been made to the search engine requesting for links to be removed from @entity7 ’s @entity89 sites			2
while @entity7 said it was unable to comment on individual cases , it is understood more than 12,000 requests – involving 44,000 urls - came from the @entity22 while around 17,500 – involving 58,000 urls - came from @entity104			1
what is the link ? those seeking to have information about them removed can visit the legal section of @entity7 's website			0
on this page , a form allows users to put in a search removal request under @entity9 data law			0
who can use the form ? only @entity9 citizens are allowed to submit a request via the form and apply to have their links removed if their legal name appears			0
they will have to explain why the link should be taken down.what requests will be considered ? all requests will be considered but @entity7 , but it will have to balance privacy with the public interest , the company has said it will not remove all cases			0
what can i do if a case is not resolved ? in @entity22 users can contact the @entity135 or take @entity7 to court .			0
