by @entity0 published : 07:17 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 07:34 est , 11 september 2012 a four - year - old boy with cerebral palsy has enjoyed a ride on his bicycle for the first time after his parents raised £ 45,000 for him to undergo a life - changing operation available only in the @entity8 just weeks ago , @entity9 could never have dreamed of playing so energetically as his movement was restricted after a stroke in the womb			1
in 2010 , he was diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy , which caused motor neuron damage to the left side of his brain affecting his movement			1
in the saddle : @entity9 , pictured with his mother @entity19 , was diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy two years ago			1
his parents raised £ 45,000 for him to undergo a life - changing operation available only in the @entity8 while temporary treatments to help his walking were available in @entity23 , his parents @entity19 and @entity9 hoped an operation only available in the @entity8 would change his life			1
they launched a fund - raising drive in february so @entity29 could undergo selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to improve his walking and perhaps even enable him to kick a football			2
after two operations @entity9 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , is now back home and beginning to enjoy playing like any other child			1
his mother is still amazed by how far the youngster has come in such a short time			2
miss @entity19 , 22 , said : ' @entity9 pedaled towards me on a bike for the first time - and i knew it had all been worthwhile			1
' to see him do what other children take for granted was a special moment			0
' there were times when i thought we were never going to make it , but to see @entity9 today thank goodness we did			1
' it has already changed our lives			0
@entity9 is now out playing and running about			1
he is beginning to do new things every day			0
' for months we ran car boot sales and bag - packed at supermarkets - it became our whole life			0
' it took the family five months to reach its target of £ 45,000			1
they then headed to @entity64 in @entity65			1
road to recovery : after two operations @entity9 , from @entity33 , @entity34 , is now back home and beginning to enjoy playing like any other child a three - hour operation to help flatten @entity9 ’s right foot was carried out on july 12			1
miss @entity19 said : ' it was an anxious time when @entity9 was going through the operation			1
but after more than three hours , @entity9 was in recovery			2
' we were given hourly updates by phone from theatre to tell us how things were going			0
' more than three hours later doctors told us everything went ok and @entity9 was being taken to recovery			2
' then came the hard part of keeping him lying flat for five days			0
he was n’t allowed out of bed or to sit up			0
' on day five , @entity9 was allowed to sit in a chair and was taken round the hospital garden in a wheelchair			2
miss @entity19 said : ' we were waiting to see when @entity9 would be allowed to walk			2
physios decided it was time for him to stand on the sixth day			0
' he got out of his chair and with no support stood up straight and from that day on has gone from strength to strength			0
' doctors decided @entity9 had to have a second operation to lengthen his heel chord , which cost more than £ 7,000			1
it gave him a lot better movement and has helped his progress			0
' we were frantically getting relatives to fundraise all over again back home and we made it			0
' we were contacted by the @entity105 in @entity33 , whose customers raised £ 3,000			1
we could never have done any of this without people ’s amazing generosity			0
' @entity9 now requires two weeks of intensive physio and has to wear a foot support for several weeks , but after that he should n’t need more than regular physio sessions			2
his mother said : ' if he had n’t had the operation he would have had a lifetime of splints and botox therapy for his muscles			0
now he has a real chance at the future he deserves			0
