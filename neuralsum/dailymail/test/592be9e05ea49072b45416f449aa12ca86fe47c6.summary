it was n't just @entity2 's rugged looks that sent ladies into a frenzy in the 1960s			2
the actor 's enduring sex appeal may have been boosted by his aftershave , @entity8 , which contained a potent chemical known as @entity10			1
now scientists have revealed how this chemical activates the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women			1
the actor 's enduring sex appeal may have been boosted by his aftershave , @entity8 , which contained a potent chemical known as @entity10			1
pictured is @entity2 starring in the 1965 film @entity28 hedione - derived from the @entity30 word ' hedone ' , for fun , pleasure , lust - has a fresh jasmine - magnolia scent			0
the @entity36 fragrance , @entity37 , was the first to use it in 1966 , and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as @entity41 by @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 by @entity45 and @entity46 no. 19			1
the latest study shows how @entity10 - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro - jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor @entity50 in humans			1
this activates part of the hypothalamus - an area of the brain responsible for triggering the release of sex hormones in women			1

the study found that @entity10 creates ' sex - specific activation patterns ' in the tissue found in the nasal cavity which connects to the brain , according to a report in the @entity73			2
here @entity10 - which has the chemical name methyl dihydro - jasmonate - activates the pheromone receptor @entity50 in humans			2
' these results constitute compelling evidence that a pheromone effect different from normal olfactory perception indeed exists in humans , ' says scent researcher prof @entity82 from @entity84 in @entity85			0
scientists analysed brain activity when a person smelled @entity10 to find out how it changed their emotions and behaviour			2
they then compared the results with the effects caused by a common floral fragrance known as phenylethyl alcohol			0
@entity10 triggered brain areas in the limbic system , which is responsible for emotions , memory and motivation , more effectively than phenylethyl alcohol			2
it also activated an area of the hypothalamus which releases sex hormones throughout body to turn people on			1
the @entity36 fragrance , @entity37 ( left ) , was the first to use @entity10 in 1966 , and it has since found its way into other fragrances such as @entity41 by @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity46 no. 19 ( right ) the @entity85 study found that @entity10 activated a specific hypothalamic region , in women more strongly than in men			1
but scientists are still divided over whether humans can actually communicate via pheromones			0
in the animal kingdom , this kind of communication is widespread			0
mice have around 300 different genes for pheromone receptors ; in humans , probably only five of them are still functional			0
' in the next stage , we want to find out which physiological and psychological parameters are affected when @entity10 activates the pheromone receptor , ' explains @entity82			0
' we also have to search for scent molecules in bodily secretions , which resemble @entity10 and activate the receptor			0
' with its help , humans could actually communicate with each other			0

actor was *famous* for wearing @entity36 's @entity8 aftershave
it contained @entity142 , a chemical that activates the brain 's hypothalamus
region is responsible for triggering release of sex hormones in women
