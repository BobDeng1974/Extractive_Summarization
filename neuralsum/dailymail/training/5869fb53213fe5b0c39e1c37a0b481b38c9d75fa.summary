' she 's incredibly determined to continue to speak for her cause			0
' both surgical procedures will be carried out within the next 10 days and will take about 90 minutes each			0

@entity65 , principal @entity66 at the trust , explained how the plate would be fitted over a hole in @entity10 ’s skull , which has been left by the path of the bullet			0
these images demonstrate how the plate for @entity10 's skull is created by using wax and shaping it to fit the contours of her skull the red line drawn diagonally down the skull shows the journey of the bullet through the schoolgirl 's head , and the plate to cover her damaged skull it was also revealed that the damaged portion of missing skull had been implanted in @entity10 ’s abdomen - where it remains - in case it was needed to repair her skull at a later date			1
