a @entity1 sighting was deemed so credible it convinced a government minister who investigated it			0
the sighting by an @entity7 fighter pilot on a training mission over @entity9 in 1952 has been revealed for the first time by papers released by the @entity12 at @entity13			1
flight sergeant @entity14 was returning to base when he was followed by a ' gleaming silver , metallic disc ' which flew alongside him before disappearing at incredible sped			1
saucer @entity18 : sgt @entity14 stands beside his fighter with its @entity1 art painted on by colleagues after he spotted a @entity1 that was confirmed by radar the object was caught by @entity7 radars , which confirmed it was travelling at speeds far greater than possible for any aircraft of the time			1
@entity14 reported the sighting and was sent to visit @entity30 , then aviation minister , to give his account in person			1
he described seeing a flash of ' silver light ' which rapidly descended towards him until he could see that it was a ' gleaming silver - metallic disc '			1
he said its surface was shiny , ' like tin foil ' , and ' without a single crease or crinkle '			0
he could see , with ' astonishing clarity ' , the craft 's ' highly reflective and absolutely seamless metallic - looking surface '			2
flying at high altitude in clear visibility in his @entity47 , he estimated its size at 100ft across – ' about the wingspan of a @entity51 bomber '			2
none of the other three pilots - all returning to @entity54 in northern @entity9 - saw the object because they were executing a ' banking turn ' and not looking in the same direction			1
silver disc : a mock - up of a @entity1 similar to the one that @entity61 said followed his craft before flying off at incredible speed six days later , @entity14 was sent to @entity64 in @entity9 to give his account to senior @entity7 officers and @entity67			1
the minister 's first question was how many beers @entity14 had drunk the night before			1
however , in the end he was so taken by the then 23 - year - old @entity14 ' story that he went on to brief senior civil servants , telling them he was convinced it was true			1
this goes against what @entity78 governments have said regarding ufos in the past - in most cases , they have been keen to downplay suggestions that @entity1 sightings are seriously investigated			0
in one newly released document , @entity30 tells the government 's chief scientist @entity83 that he found the story and radar evidence ' convincing '			2
@entity14 reported the sighting and was sent to visit @entity30 ( above ) , then aviation minister , to give his account in person in reference to similar @entity1 sightings by @entity93 pilots , what became known as ' @entity95 ' , @entity30 says in the document : ' i have no doubt at all that @entity14 saw a phenomenon similar to that described by numerous observers in the @entity93			1
' lord @entity83 had previously dismissed the @entity93 sightings as ' mass psychology '			0
@entity30 , who later became @entity103 , went on : ' until some satisfactory scientific explanation can be provided , it would be most unwise to accept without further question the view that " flying saucers " can be dismissed as " a mild form of hysteria "			0
' @entity14 was flying at high altitude in clear visibility on his way to @entity54 in northern @entity9 when he spotted the @entity1 he added that there was ' ample evidence of some unfamiliar and unexplained phenomenon '			1
the documents were investigated by @entity118 , a @entity119 academic , while researching for a book on @entity1			0
dr @entity118 was contacted by @entity14 ' son , who recounted his father 's version of events and gave him his log book			1
after the sighting , @entity14 , who died in 2009 aged 79 , was nicknamed ' @entity127 ' and colleagues painted a flying saucer on his jet			2
@entity14 ' son @entity131 , 45 , a @entity132 civil servant said : ' we knew about the sighting in the family when we were growing up but my father did n't talk about it a lot			2
we learned about it more from prompting him			0
' if it was someone other than my father who had told this story , i would be sceptical			0
' he once said to me " people think you 're mad if you say you 've seen a flying saucer – i 've only ever seen one once ; i 've never seen one since "			0
' dr @entity118 said : ' there is absolutely no doubt that something was seen by @entity14			2
he was not making this up			0
' but the only honest position to take is that we do n't know what it was			0
but there could be some sort of scientific explanation , before you start jumping to conclusions about alien visitors			0

*flt* sgt @entity14 was returning to base over @entity9
object , 100ft across , was ' gleaming silver , metallic disc '
radar confirmed it was travelling at speeds far greater than any aircraft at the time
