by @entity0 published : 16:58 est , 10 april 2013 updated : 03:33 est , 11 april 2013 back in 1986 , a producer friend at the @entity2 suggested that a book i had written , the @entity7 woman ’s @entity5 , would make a good documentary film			1
the book was not about fashion , but about women ’s feelings about their clothes			1
princess @entity13 was the star of the printed version : we wanted @entity16 to take that role in the film			1
with curiously little difficulty , a visit to 10 @entity20 was arranged			1
we would be allowed half an hour talking to @entity16 in her sitting room at the top of the house			1
it was hoped that i would be able to persuade her to show us a few of her favourite clothes			1
some days before the interview , my producer friend , @entity31 received a command from on high in the @entity2			1
there was a single question they were adamant i should put to the prime minister : where did she get her knickers ? not quite able to believe they should require me to do something so impolite , i said i refused to ask that			1
me and my wardrobe : @entity16 spoke about her style in an interview with the @entity2 in 1986 in that case , came the reply , my producer would have to take over the interview			1
even as we arrived at @entity20 , i still had not decided what to do			1
i did not want the interview to be snatched away , but felt the rude question was impossible to ask			1
a security man , unsure of the way , led us upstairs , and down , and up , trying to pretend he and his band of followers were n’t lost			1
eventually , we reached the top floor			1
it was flung open by the prime minister			1
she greeted us with extraordinary enthusiasm			1
it was only later that we heard that , for her , it was the sixth interview of the day			1
she led us into the sitting room			1
there , some 20 different garments were hanging before us on a long clothes rack			2
she had abandoned her lunch break to heave them from her bedroom into the sitting room			2
never could she have imagined how helpful she had been : now , she and i could saunter along the line , stop at each dress or suit , and i would ask about its history			2
charmed : @entity0 found the former pm to be agreeable and helpful in those days , filming on location was made difficult by the short time of each magazine ( length of film ) in the camera — ten minutes			2
towards the end of each magazine a clunking , warning noise could be heard			2
what seemed like seconds into the first part of the interview , the juddering sound could be heard , and we ’d hardly started			2
only 20 minutes to go ... mrs @entity16 remembered the history of everything on the rack , and described each one with merry recall			1
she pointed to a severe beige suit			2
‘ this we wore on a visit to the @entity106 missile , ’ she explained , with a touch of nostalgia			2
the ‘ we ’ she referred to meant , i think , she and her dressmaker			2
most of the clothes were made for her by this lady , and chiefly designed by the prime minister herself			2
‘ i invented this skirt , ’ she said , and swished a long evening dress down from the rack			2
one side of the skirt was slashed to reveal a coloured petticoat beneath it			2
‘ it ’s one of my favourites			2
i ’ve noticed some designers have begun to copy the idea			0
’ i observed that on the whole she chose dark colours			0
‘ yes : that ’s what @entity130 says			0
he likes a bright colour , so i had this made			0
’ she held up another dress — this one of dazzling flamingo pink			0
@entity138 , clunk went the camera			0
twenty minutes gone now , and no opening for the dreaded knicker question			0
she explained that she rarely bought clothes from designers			1
what she enjoyed , she said , in the name of economy , was finding ‘ the end of a roll ’ of material			0
dress sense mrs @entity16 summed up her style as ' never flashy , just appropriate ' however , she did love @entity154 clothes			1
i cheekily pointed out that the jacket i was wearing was by @entity154			0
i had chosen it on purpose : it led to further bonding			0
i asked her why there were two identical dresses			0
‘ well , you see , we needed a whole roll of stuff for one dress , but there was just enough for a second one , so naturally we used that , too			0
i always like to use up the end of a roll			0
’ @entity138 , clunk went the camera , and we were only half way down the rack			0
mrs @entity177 had done her first interview that morning at 6am			0
it was completely reasonable of her to afford us half an hour , but two hours had gone by			0
and still no opening for the knicker question			0
i was beginning to panic			0
but she carried on cheerfully , flicking through some dresses that president @entity183 had liked			0
then she came to a dull - looking navy blazer			0
‘ @entity185 ’ , she said			1
pretty in pink : the @entity187 often wore dark colours but had some colourful clothes made on husband @entity130 ' request the dreaded clunking began			0
‘ do you get a lot of things from @entity185 ? ’ ‘ well , they ’re very kind			1
they open a store at eight in the morning for me			0
’ ‘ and do you get your underwear there , like everyone else ? ’ ‘ yes			1
’ end of film , and the @entity2 had its answer			1
underwear was surely less offensive than knickers			1
we had spent three hours with the prime minister , so happily engrossed that , apparently , she had not noticed the passing of time			0
i liked to think it was an agreeable break from politics for her			0
she began to return the clothes to her bedroom , and made tea for everyone			0
her warmth , her exuberance and her enjoyment of an unusual interview were surprising and unforgettable			0

@entity226 took place at @entity20 when @entity16 was in power
she spoke about her wardrobe choices for @entity2 documentary
she admitted she bought her underwear in @entity185
