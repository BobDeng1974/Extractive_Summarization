by @entity0 published : 11:03 est , 3 june 2013 updated : 12:19 est , 3 june 2013 @entity1 is reviewing proposed changes to the law which would increase the number of ethnic minority officers joining the police force			1
under the proposals , which @entity1 is discussing with the government , the @entity7 would have to recruit an ethnic minority officer for every white constable they hire			1
@entity7 chiefs believe the move is necessary to make the police force , which is currently a ' white , male - dominated ' organisation , more representative of the community it serves			1
proposed positive discrimination : @entity1 is in discussion with the government over proposed changes to the law which could help increase the number of ethnic minorities on the @entity7 police force just 10 per cent of the @entity7 ’s 32,000 officers are from ethnic minority backgrounds compared to 40 per cent of @entity31 ’s overall population			1
@entity1 is now considering a system similar to that used in @entity34 where one @entity36 officer was recruited for every @entity38 officer to bring proportional representation to the force			1
a @entity7 spokesman said : ' the @entity7 is considering a range of positive action options as permitted under the @entity44 to help attract applications in our forthcoming recruitment process for approximately 5,000 new officers , which will enable our workforce to be more representative of the communities it serves			1
' we know from the 2011 census that @entity31 is more diverse than ever and that our workforce does not reflect that diversity as we would like it to , despite significant progress in recent years			2
time for change : assistant commissioner @entity59 said the @entity60 needs to overcome its history of being a white , male - dominated organisation ' options under consideration include access to coaching by established officers , the provisions of additional training prior to candidates attending assessment centres , changes to the application and selection processes and bursaries for @entity77 students			1
' no final decisions on these options have been yet been taken			0
' other police forces and organisations have used positive discrimination to make their membership more representative of the wider community			0
the 50 - 50 recruitment rule for the @entity86 ( @entity86 ) is one of the best known examples of positive discrimination			0
from 2001 , the force was legally obliged to operate a policy of recruiting a @entity36 officer for every @entity38 it employed in order to address the under - representation of the @entity84 that had existed for many decades in policing			1
before the rule was introduced , the former @entity95 ( @entity95 ) was made up of 92 per cent from the @entity38 / @entity98 community			0
by february 2011 , 29.7 per cent of the 7,200 officers were from the @entity36 community and the scheme was ended in march that year			0
in @entity103 , a ' quota system ' was enforced in 1998 which meant the country 's cricket team had to include a minimum of four players from ethnic backgrounds in their starting eleven for each match			2
the country announced plans last year to scrap the scheme in favour of a new system which would monitor ' transformation targets ' of all sports instead of enforcing them			0
although the spokesman added that , despite the 50 - 50 law change being openly discussed by police chiefs , it was not part of the force 's current proposals			1
they continued : ' this would require a change in the law and whilst it has been quite openly discussed by the @entity7 , as well other forces , it is recognised that the context is very different and it is not within our current proposals			1
' nevertheless we continue to explore how we target groups in our recruitment processes to bring different skills and knowledge to the police service			0
' the comments come after assistant commissioner @entity59 , who is in charge of @entity142 , said the current race relations law does n’t allow the force ' to be as bold as we could be ' ahead of a huge public recruitment campaign for 5,000 officers over the next three to four years			2
in an interview with the @entity148 , he said : ' we have not kept pace with the changing shape of @entity31 ... the thing we have got to overcome , by legacy and history , we have broadly been , initially , a white , male - dominated organisation			2
' @entity59 revealed the @entity7 is also considering outsourcing its recruitment in an attempt to prevent the issue from continuing			2
sir @entity158 , chief constable of @entity160 police , added : ' the police service is not as effective as it could be in countering terrorism because of its ethnic makeup			0
' a big part of dealing with terrorism and crime is gathering intelligence , having people who get to know local people so they have the confidence to pass information			0
' the @entity172 said it was opposed to positive discrimination with its chairman @entity174 stating : ' any discrimination is wrong , appointment should only be based on merit			0

just 10 **%** of @entity7 's officers are from ethnic minorities
but 40 **%** of @entity31 population are ethnic minorities
law change could see @entity7 having to recruit an ethnic minority officer for every white constable they hire
it could help bring proportional representation to force
