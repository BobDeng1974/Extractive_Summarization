by @entity0 published : 05:17 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 09:04 est , 25 february 2013 beneath the waters of the @entity6 , by the idyllic islands of @entity3 and @entity4 , there lies traces of an ancient , hidden continent , new research claims			1
the continent fragment known as @entity11 detached about 60million years ago while @entity12 and @entity13 drifted apart , researchers say , and had lain concealed beneath huge masses of lava			1
and it appears such micro-continents hidden beneath the oceans occur more frequently than previously thought , says a study in the latest issue of @entity22			1
@entity24 beach : an international team of researchers deduced the existence of a lost continent beneath the waters of the @entity6 through a study of grains of sand taken from the beaches of @entity4 @entity11 was a strip of land which was once tucked between @entity13 and @entity12 - two landmasses now separated by thousands of miles of deep ocean , but which were then next door to each other			1
an international team of researchers deduced its existence through a study of grains of sand taken from the beaches of @entity4			1
the grains were dated back to a volcanic eruption which took place about nine million years ago , but analysis showed they contained minerals that were much older			1
professor @entity50 , from the @entity51 , @entity52 , told the @entity53 : ' we found zircons that we extracted from the beach sands , and these are something you typically find in a continental crust			2
they are very old in age			2
' the break - up of continents is often associated with geological phenomena known as mantle plumes			2
these are giant bubbles of hot rock which rise from deep within our planet and soften tectonic plates from below , until the plates break apart at the hotspots			2
this is how @entity74 broke apart about 170million years ago			2
at first , one part was separated , which in turn fragmented into @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity78 and @entity79 , which then migrated to their present position			1
plumes currently sitting beneath the islands @entity84 and @entity3 appear to have played a role in the emergence of the @entity6			1
if the zone of the rupture lies at the edge of a land mass ( in this case @entity12 and @entity13 ) , fragments of this land mass may be separated off			1
the @entity94 are a well - known example of such a continental fragment			1
the coloured track ( left colour scale ) west of reunion is the calculated movement of the reunion hotspot			0
the black lines with yellow circles and the red circle indicate the corresponding calculated track on the @entity107 plate and the @entity6 plate , respectively			0
the numbers in the circles are ages in millions of years			0
the areas with topography just below the sea surface are now regarded as continental fragments an underwater ' @entity116 ' has been captured in a series of spectacular images created by a @entity120 survey ship			0
@entity121 discovered the 250 metre - deep canyon in the @entity123 during a nine - month mission to improve understanding of the waters east of @entity127			0
the 3d images were created after the ship left the @entity131 port of @entity132 and were made using the @entity135 - based survey ship 's multibeam echo sounder			0
commander @entity136 , commanding officer of @entity121 , said : ' these features could be the result of ancient rivers scouring through the rock strata before the @entity123 flooded millennia ago			0
' a group of geoscientists from @entity52 , @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146 have now published research that suggests , based on the study of lava sand grains from the beach of @entity4 , the existence of further fragments			1
the sand grains contain semi-precious zircons aged between 660 and 1,970million years , which is explained by the fact that the zircons were carried by the lava as it pushed through subjacent continental crust of this age			1
this dating method was supplemented by a recalculation of plate tectonics , which explains exactly how and where the fragments ended up in the @entity6			0
dr @entity165 of the @entity166 for geosciences and dr @entity168 of @entity51 calculated the hotspot trail			0
' on the one hand , it shows the position of the plates relative to the two hotspots at the time of the rupture , which points towards a causal relation , ' said dr @entity165			0
' on the other hand , we were able to show that the continent fragments continued to wander almost exactly over the @entity182 , which explains how they were covered by volcanic rock			2
' so what was previously interpreted only as the trail of the reunion hotspot , are continental fragments which were previously not recognised as such because they were covered by the volcanic rocks of the reunion plume			0
it therefore appears that such micro-continents in the ocean occur more frequently than previously thought .			0

@entity196 fragment known as @entity11 once linked @entity12 and @entity13
it sank beneath the waves as the two land masses drifted apart
researchers deduce its existence by analysing sand from @entity4
it contained minerals which suggest grains were once part of lost continent
