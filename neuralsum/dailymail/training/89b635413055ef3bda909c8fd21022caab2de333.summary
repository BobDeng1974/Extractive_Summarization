but this jam is caused by something considerably less serious			0
the opening of a @entity10 drive - thru doughnut store has led to three days of road chaos , with motorists queuing for up to an hour for the shop			1
queues on the ring ( doughnut ) road : parts of @entity19 were gridlocked as hungry motorists waited for hours @entity21 stopping them : customers waited in the snow and the dark to get into the doughnut store staff had to alert police as tailbacks grew around the retail park where motorists were queuing for doughnuts got there in the end : @entity35 , aged 7 , enjoys her iced doughnut in @entity19 and traffic police have resorted to urging drivers to avoid the area altogether			1
yesterday , two patrol cars were sent to the @entity42 retail park , on the outskirts of @entity19 , to try to stop @entity10 customers causing a complete traffic meltdown			1
the store opened on wednesday and has been inundated with customers , causing problems for other shops on the park and transport bosses as the tailbacks reach the busy city bypass and @entity54			2
a @entity57 police spokesman said : ‘ the traffic is getting very busy and we are advising motorists to avoid that side of town on their journeys			0
’ the officers at @entity42 did manage to mix business with pleasure – receiving a box of doughnuts from the shop for their hard work			1
one policeman was seen enjoying a bite before putting the box in the back of his van			0
the store , the first opened in @entity78 by the @entity80 chain , took £ 60,000 on its first day – three times its previous @entity82 record			2
some customers even came from @entity84 to buy the doughnuts , which cost £ 10.95 for 12 ‘ pick your own ’			0
not everyone was impressed , however , with one @entity89 user posting : ' @entity19 will be obese within a year '			2
the best - selling doughnuts in the @entity19 store were the original glazed , chocolate iced with sprinkles , and chocolate iced creme - filled			1

@entity108 , of the @entity109 , said : ‘ if @entity19 is overweight today then it will certainly be obese by tomorrow			0
‘ i thought after the deep - fried @entity112 bar that i had seen the worst , but this is actually unbelievable – that people would go to such lengths to buy doughnuts			0
’ nearly there : some of those waiting had been lured there by free doughnuts given out to shoppers on @entity19 's @entity120 jam - packed : the roads leading to the @entity80 doughnut store saw tailbacks of up to a mile long			1
