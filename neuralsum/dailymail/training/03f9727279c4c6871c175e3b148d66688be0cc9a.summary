by @entity1 reporter published : 19:14 est , 3 january 2014 updated : 06:23 est , 4 january 2014 a man claiming to be one of the most decorated @entity5 in military history has been rooted out as a fraud after swindling investors for hundreds of thousands of dollars			1
@entity9 went all the way while weaving fictitious connections to the elite army force , claiming that he was the one who fired the kill shot during the @entity15 raid			2
the @entity17 leader was n't the only international warlord that he brought down either , he said , as he also told confidantes and would - be employees that he was responsible for killing @entity23 drug lord @entity22			0
she met him at a military - style training camp that he launched in @entity48 , @entity49 where she met him			1
' he would drop little bits of things that are plausible			0
and he would tailor that plausibility story to each person , knowing what they knew , ' she said			0
in fact , @entity9 had no military history and was a 57 - year - old former bartender with a criminal record			1
his ruse was not just intended to win him some enamored fans but also some serious cash			0
after launching his training camp , he got the backing of two doctors who were happy to invest in his up - and - coming defense company that he called @entity69			1
the company went on to win a contract from a group affiliated with the @entity73 that was valued at an alleged half - billion dollars			1
making a name : @entity9 first launched a military - style training camp in @entity49 using his alleged ' expertise ' from his fake career in the @entity5 and the @entity78 that meant a big take - home profit for all involved , including the two doctors who invested $ 850,000 in the company to get it up and running			1
@entity9 asked ms @entity45 to work with him and she agreed to help launch the company and go on their first contracted mission to @entity86 after seeing his falsified documents			2
he had discharge papers - that he printed off the internet - as well as two fraudulent @entity90 and a fake email of praise from col. @entity93 , the former @entity94 lieutenant colonel best known for his connection to the @entity96			0
she only began to suspect that something was awry when they arrived in @entity86			0
on their second night , the power in the hotel went out and @entity9 unlike that of an experienced military commander			2
' he freaked out , picked up his phone ... runs into the other room talking to the @entity78 to have them reposition his satellite so he can make sure that the rebels are n't coming to get him			0
he says , " alpha , bravo , niner , niner , six , two , the fishing is good in @entity114 , " ' she told 20/20			0
trouble brewing : the company that he launched - with the help of $ 850,000 from investors - took up a contract in @entity86 and his employees said his erratic behavior while there sparked their doubts digging : it was then that they looked him up online and found this video of actual @entity5 @entity127 who took to the web to vent about all of the lies that @entity9 had been spewing another @entity132 who traveled to @entity134 with @entity9 began questioning the situation once they touched down			1
' none of the major players there in @entity86 ... knew who we were , what we were doing there , ' chief pilot @entity144 said to @entity46			0
' i mean , the stuff he was coming up with is justâ € ” it was insane ... the whole situation there was dangerous			0
' it was only then that @entity45 and @entity144 began to really dig into @entity9 's background and they were not reassured by what they found			1
apparently they were n't the first to question his credentials , as a true former @entity5 had made it his mission to stop people from believing @entity9 's story			1
senior chief @entity127 runs a similar training camp in @entity162 and also fields calls from potential employers looking to verify people who claim to be @entity5			1
' i verify , on average , at least 20 fraudulent @entity5 claims a day , ' @entity127 said to @entity46			2
next problem : @entity9 remains in hiding but , because of his prior felony convictions that forbid him from owning firearms , he now faces illegal weapons charges the @entity9 case stuck with him , however , and he got so frustrated by having to continually deny his false claims that @entity127 made a video talking to the camera about how angry @entity9 's story made him			1
' oh , he says he has got two @entity90 , that has n't happened since @entity177			0
. a pow ? there 's no listing			0
@entity181 has a mental problem , and i go after the worst of the worst			0
after seeing the video online , @entity45 and @entity144 got back to @entity49 and told the investors about @entity187 € ™ s true background			2
once they began asking questions , @entity9 fled - originally to his parentâ € ™ s house in @entity191 and then to a remote part of @entity193 - moving whenever a local news affiliate started digging into his claims			1
it is unclear how he and his former investors have left their relationship , but @entity9 still has to deal with pending criminal charges			2
once his military background was proved false and his criminal record was found instead , that meant that he could face felony firearm charges since convicted felons are not allowed to own fire arms which is tricky for him as he promoted his training camp with videos of him firing a number of high - powered rifles			1
when 20/20 , which airs the full investigation friday night , approached @entity9 at his rural @entity193 home , he refused to comment and said nothing about his web of lies .			0

@entity9 made *massive* claims about his completely fictitious military background , saying he was a @entity5 and @entity219
was actually a @entity49 - based bartender with a criminal record
launched a military - style training camp and later a security company that won a contract from a group associated with the @entity73
after his employees began asking questions , he went into hiding
