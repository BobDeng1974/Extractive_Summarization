a hundred years ago , @entity0 fought in some of the fiercest battles of the @entity2			2
luckily he survived , but his grandson @entity3 , now @entity3 , remembers how the old man would only speak of the ' painful memories ' of the @entity2			1
and today the pontiff made a holy pilgrimage to @entity9 's largest war memorial to pay homage to the sacrifices made by @entity0 and millions of others			2
standing amid row upon row of tombstones dedicated to @entity9 soldiers who fell during the @entity2 , @entity3 warned of a ' third world war ' amid new threats from the @entity19 and @entity20			1
he said : ' @entity21 needs to weep and this is the time to weep			0
even today , after the second failure of another world war , perhaps one can speak of a third war , one fought piecemeal , with crimes , massacres , destruction			2
around 60,000 of the tombs are unmarked as their occupants have never been identified the @entity34 campaign claimed the lives of almost half the @entity9 soldiers to die during the @entity2 , and was the worst defeat in the country 's military history ' @entity2 is irrational ; its only plan is to bring destruction : it seeks to grow by destroying			1
greed , intolerance , the lust for power			0
these motives underlie the decision to go to war and they are too often justified by an ideology			0
' he recalled the trauma suffered by his own grandfather , who fought during @entity9 's bloody campaign along the @entity34 , close to the graveyard , before emigrating to @entity70 after the war			1
between 1915 and 1917 the @entity9 army launched a series of bloody attacks against the @entity39 forces stationed along the @entity34 , losing almost half of all soldiers killed in the conflict there			1
the pontiff prayed among gravestones in an @entity39 cemetery , before visiting @entity9 's largest war memorial where he held an open - air mass beside a fascist - era monument to 100,000 fallen soldiers			1
@entity3 ' grandfather , @entity0 , was one of thousands of @entity9 who fought in the trenches near the @entity34 , which was part of @entity91 at the time , but now part of @entity32 close to the border with @entity9			1
@entity9 general , @entity96 , believed an attack across the fortified mountainous terrain could pierce the @entity39 defenses , shattering their defensive line and allowing large territorial gains			2
however , the entrenched opposition made the @entity9 pay dearly for even modest moves forward , and following reinforcements by the @entity106 in october 1917 , they overran the @entity9 lines , inflicting the largest defeat in the country 's military history			2
the 12 battles of the campaign are memorialized at the @entity114 monument which was dedicated by @entity9 's @entity116 government in 1938 on the eve of @entity118 ' i have heard many painful stories from the lips of my grandfather , ' the pope has said			1
pope @entity3 prays at military cemetery for @entity2 soldiers at @entity126 , near @entity127 , a town his grandfather fought against @entity39 troops to capture @entity3 held an open - air @entity130 today near to the @entity126 monument today , close to where his grandfather fought during the war before emigrating to @entity70 @entity3 recalled the ' painful memories ' his grandfather shared with him about the @entity2 today , before reiterating his calls for peace between nations @entity3 visited an @entity39 cemetery where he prayed briefly ( pictured ) before going to @entity9 's largest war memorial 100 yards away paying tribute to the war dead on the 100th anniversary of the start of the conflict , @entity3 recalled ' many painful stories ' his grandfather told him of the fighting hundreds of thousands of @entity9 troops died trying to cross the @entity34 between 1915 and 1917			1
the only meaningful success came with the capture of @entity127 ( pictured left ) in august 1916 , but the town was quickly overrun by @entity106 and @entity39 forces the following year the elder @entity3 , who was drafted at age 30 as @entity9 entered the war , took part in the @entity34 campaign , obtaining a certificate of good conduct and 200 lire at the war 's end , according to documents from the time			1
with postwar @entity9 's economy stalled , he emigrated to @entity70 where @entity3 - then known as @entity3 - was born			1
the enduring impact of war , is evident in the visitors who still make pilgrimages to the monument , although in ever decreasing numbers , said @entity114 mayor @entity169			0
' the @entity170 until 20 years ago was always full of visitors , but it has been forgotten by institutional memory , ' @entity169 said			0
' the papal visit is very important because it renews attention on this history			0
' the monument consists of 22 granite steps leading upwards to three large crosses			0
it marks the burial spot of 100,000 @entity9 soldiers , around 60,00 of which have never been identified			1
pope @entity3 standing near the @entity39 cemetery in @entity114 before be went on to hold an open - air mass at the nearby @entity114 memorial to @entity9 soldiers @entity9 's entrance into the war was long - anticipated , and @entity39 heavily reinforced the @entity34 beforehand with trench systems and artillery emplacements mounted units from the @entity192 wade into the @entity193 in 1915			1
despite years of attacks , @entity9 forced were never able to capture it @entity3 ' grandfather , @entity0 , was drafted into the @entity9 army aged 30 as the country entered the war , before emigrating to @entity70 after it finished the @entity39 cemetery , one of several in the area , contains 14,406 dead from five nations that fought under the @entity39 , with only 2,406 identified			1
many visitors to the @entity9 monument search the engraved names for their forbears			2
' they are making a lot of saints these days			0
even popes , ' said @entity211 , 52 , of @entity212 , who was visiting the site with her @entity9 military veteran husband			2
' but for me , these are the real saints			0
' just two levels up from the altar where @entity3 will say @entity130 , the name of a fallen soldier named @entity221 is engraved in a wall			2
@entity223 , the local priest , said he is not believed to be related to the pope			0
but @entity2 historian , col. @entity225 , who has found two @entity226 listed among the @entity9 casualties of @entity2 , said it remained a possibility			0
' @entity3 is not a common name , ' @entity225 said			0
' it is likely that they are related			0
' @entity169 , the mayor of @entity114 , said the @entity3 's visit was important to spark interest in the grave sites , which have been largely forgotten the @entity114 monument is a @entity238 - era monument dedicated just before the outbreak of the @entity118 and contains 60,000 unmarked graves among the 40,000 named soldiers buried there are two with the surname @entity3 , though it is not known if they are related to the @entity3 @entity91 - @entity247 troops fire at advancing @entity9 soldiers along the @entity34 when @entity9 joined the @entity2 in 1915 , one of its first moves was to launch an attack against @entity39 forces massing along a mountain range at the head of the @entity256 , in what is modern - day @entity258			1
@entity9 general @entity96 believed the best chance of breaking through the defensive line was to cross the north end of the @entity34 , bypassing the mountains and coming at the @entity39 forces from the rear			1
however , @entity9 's entrance to the war was well anticipated , and @entity39 had sent large numbers of men and artillery to the region ahead of time which were dug in along mountainous ridges overlooking key attacking positions			1
modern historians largely accept that there were 12 battles of the @entity34 , though the fighting was so fierce and prolonged that one battle often merged into the next , and the total has long been disputed			2
between june 1915 and march 1916 , the @entity9 forces tried to cross the river on five separate occasions , but on every one they were repelled , suffering heavy losses for only modest gains in territory			0
during the sixth battle , from august 6 â€“ 17 , 1916 , general @entity96 finally captured the town of @entity127 and with it a bridgehead across the @entity34 , which marked the first victories of the campaign			0
a series of small , intense attacks followed as the @entity9 attempted to limit their casualties , before two large assaults			0
the second , between august 19 and september 12 , 1917 , involved 51 divisions and 5,200 guns , and succeeded in forcing the defending troops back			0
fearing that the line was in danger of being overrun , the @entity106 reinforced their allies and in october 24 their combined forces took to the offensive , forcing the @entity9 to retreat			0
many war - weary soldiers simply threw down their weapons and were captured , though many units continued to fight as they retreated toward the @entity311 where they finally held the line			2
in total , between 300,000 and 600,000 troops died during the fighting , almost half of all the @entity9 soldiers to be killed during the war , making it the worst defeat in the country 's military history			1
@entity323 's book , @entity322 , captures the conflict through the eyes of protagonist @entity322 , though the author himself was never involved in the fighting			1
instead , @entity323 served as an ambulance driver at @entity331 between june and july of 1918 , after @entity9 forces had retreated away from @entity34			1
he spent three weeks with @entity333 before asking to be transferred to canteen duty along the more active from along the @entity311			0
it was herem , at @entity337 on july 8 , 1918 that he was hit by @entity91 trench mortar			0
he was evacuated to a hospital in order to recover and never rejoined the war on active duty .			0
