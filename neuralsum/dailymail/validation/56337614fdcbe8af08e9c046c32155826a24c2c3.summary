@entity1 presidential hopeful @entity0 has been forced to apologize for comments made on wednesday in which he said prisoners ' changing their sexuality in jail proves that being gay is a choice			1
the retired neurosurgeon posted a statement on his @entity11 page just hours later in which he said he ' realized that my choice of language does not reflect fully my heart on gay issues			1
' ' i do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation			0
i regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive			0
for that i apologize unreservedly to all that were offended , ' he added			0
' some of our brightest minds have looked at this debate , and up until this point there have been no definitive studies that people are born into a specific sexuality , ' he said			2
@entity0 's opinion is at odds with many in the medical community , including the @entity47 , who says ' most people experience little or no sense of choice about their sexual orientation			1
' @entity0 had landed himself in hot water on wednesday morning after appearing on @entity55 's @entity54			1
asked by @entity56 if being gay was a choice , @entity0 replied : ' absolutely			1
' ' because a lot of people who go into prison go into prison straight - and when they come out , they 're gay			2
so , did something happen while they were in there ? ask yourself that question , ' @entity0 said			0
he then spoke out against gay marriage			1
' why do gay people want to get married ? why do they say they want to get married ? because they want to have various rights - property rights , visitation rights , ' he said			0
@entity0 's apology only went so far and he remains adamant that it is n't certain whether people are born either gay or straight ' why ca n't any two human beings , i do n't care what their sexual orientation is , why ca n't they have the legal right to do those things ? that does not require changing the definition of marriage			1
' @entity0 said he believes marriage should be decided at the state level , this on the same day the @entity90 ignored a federal ruling and in a near unanimous vote ordered the state 's probate judges to stop issuing marriage licenses to gay couples			1
@entity0 has long been outspoken on the subject of gay marriage , which he compared to bestiality and pedophilia in a 2013 speech			1
in an interview with @entity103 , @entity0 said ; ' my thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman			2
it 's a well - established , fundamental pillar of society and no group , be they gays , be they @entity113 , be they people who believe in bestiality			0
it does n't matter what they are			0
' he continued by saying ; ' they do n't get to change the definition			0
it 's not something that is against gays , it 's against anybody who wants to come along and change the fundamental definitions of pillars of society			0
' the comments came as a shock at the time as up to that point @entity0 has come across as an affable and moderate @entity1 in a series of interviews			2
the backlash was so strong , especially among @entity137 , that @entity0 was forced to withdraw from delivering the commencement address at his alma mater @entity140			0
earlier this week @entity0 launched an exploratory committee to run for president , becoming the first high - profile @entity1 candidate to potentially enter the 2016 race .			2
