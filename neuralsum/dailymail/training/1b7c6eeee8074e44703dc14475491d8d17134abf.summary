a thief who avoided jail by faking a pregnancy has finally been locked up after her lies unravelled			1
@entity4 , 37 , told police she was 13 weeks pregnant when she was arrested for stealing £ 14,700 from her aunt and spending it on beauty treatments and a @entity9			1
by the time she had her day in court , the total was seven months - so a judge took pity on her and suspended jail as she rubbed her ' bump '			1
now you see it ... thief @entity4 , 37 , has finally been locked up after faking a pregnancy to avoid jail			1
she is pictured left after her hearing for stealing from her aunt last year - where she held her ' bump ' - and right today @entity22 originally received a four - month sentence suspended for two years last october for stealing £ 14,700 from her aunt @entity24			1
a court heard the resident of @entity27 , @entity28 - who has a 16 - year - old son - was concerned her aunt 's partner @entity33 , 41 , was going to take the money out of the country			1
but instead of putting away the money for safekeeping she bought a large tv and @entity9 as well as beauty treatments and designer goods			2
when police investigated she showed them a false @entity42 bank statement she had created , and later pleaded guilty			2
@entity43 : the court heard @entity22 made up a lie in the heat of the moment and stuck to it resolutely but when she was first arrested in june she told the custody sergeant she was 13 weeks pregnant - an elaborate lie she maintained for months , @entity49 heard today			1
she was even photographed holding her ' bump ' as she left court , prosecutor @entity53 said			0
probation officers became suspicious after her due date had passed and there was no baby to be found			1
she showed them pictures of a child she claimed to be her baby , and said the child was staying with a relative , before eventually claiming she had lost the pregnancy			1
when she was challenged about what had really happened she finally agreed she had lied to police			0
the prosecutor said : ' she claimed she had panicked , she had not set out to improve her situation			0
once the lie had been told she simply could not retract			0
' the probation team were suspicious but gave her the benefit of the doubt			1
' they would ask her about the progress of the pregnancy and the defendant continued to lie			0
' philips pleaded guilty to one count of perverting the course of justice			0
@entity82 , defending , said : ' she is genuinely sorry , embarrassed and ashamed for her actions			0
' what started as a lie given in expediency when she was first arrested by the police has spiralled into something extremely serious			0
' she recognises she had opportunities throughout the proceedings to correct the lie she gave to police			0
' judge @entity97 , who handed down the original suspended sentence for theft , said this time an immediate jail term was required			2
he said her fake pregnancy had been taken into account when he decided to spare her jail last year - despite him feeling a custodial sentence was ' richly deserved '			2
' you avoided jail because of your bogus mitigation , ' he told her			2
' it would be wholly unjust , not just to @entity24 but to the public , if that was to happen again			0
a judge at @entity49 ( pictured ) said it would be ' wholly unjust ' to allow @entity22 ' lies to win the day ' you conned your aunt and then during the course of mitigation you said you were expecting a child only months away so the court took that into account and suspended the sentence			1
' this was an lie made out of panic and an attempt to protect your son seeing you being taken away in handcuffs			0
' but @entity22 ' victim @entity24 , 46 , hit out at today 's sentence branding it ' disgusting '			2
' @entity4 will be out in a few months , ' she said			1
' what i really wanted was for her to be ordered by the court to pay the money back			0
i have been in debt because of @entity4 since 2011			1
' me and my partner @entity135 have managed to pay most of it back , but the whole thing has had an horrific impact on our lives			0
we have been scrimping and scraping to get by			0
