@entity2 's broken society is slowly on the mend , with a quarter of a million more children living with both parents than when the government came to power , @entity0 said today			1
the @entity8 , who oversees all government policy on social justice , said there were other ‘ signs of hope ’ , including 160,000 people having taken up an offer of support to keep troubled families together			1
in a major speech in @entity19 , mr @entity0 said he believed a ‘ revolution is underway ’ in some of @entity2 ’s ‘ poorest neighbourhoods ’			1
work and pensions secretary @entity0 said 250,000 more children were living with both parents than in 2010 there are record numbers of people in work , up two million since 2010 , 33,000 pupils on free school meals are now getting good grades in @entity31 and @entity32 and members of 53,000 troubled families are back to school or into work , he said			1
official figures also suggest 2,100 former gang members are ‘ back on the straight and narrow ’			0
the latest figures show economic inactivity is at a historic low , and more than 800,000 fewer people are on the main out - of - work benefits			1
there has also been the largest ever annual fall both in youth unemployment and workless households			0
‘ each and every one of these statistics is a rise in hope			0
each and every one , a life transformed , ’ mr @entity0 said			0
he claimed that the @entity6 had been ‘ unwavering in its commitment to social reform ’ , saying changes to welfare , education , justice and health were all designed ‘ so that they no longer trap people , but set them on a path from dependency to independence ’			1
‘ social justice is about offering meaningful routes out of disadvantage , and dispelling the appalling idea that it is easier to manage the problem than to help transform people ’s lives			1
‘ for you do n’t solve addiction by parking people on methadone			1
you do n’t stop problem debt by abandoning people to payday lenders			2
‘ you do n’t rehabilitate offenders by simply locking them away , and you do n't cure welfare dependency by parking people on benefits			2
’ the decline of the traditional family , pictured in the 1950s , had damaged the prospects of the poor , @entity0 has said previous governments had thrown ‘ more and more taxpayers ’ money on ineffective remedial policies , in the hope of doing something ’ about the country ’s social ills , he said			2
the coalition had pioneered a new approached , investing in programmes based on results and which involved ‘ intervening early ’ and ‘ offering second chances out where lives do go off track ’			0
‘ it has not been easy , for cultural change is never quick			0
yet i believe we are now seeing real progress , ’ mr @entity0 said			0
‘ it starts with prevention : getting to the source of social problems early , rather than waiting to pick up the pieces			2
’ he pointed to schemes in health , where new family nurse partnerships are now helping vulnerable mothers in over 100 councils , and the record number of parents – more than a million – now using children ’s centres			1
some 260,000 disadvantaged two - year - olds are now benefiting from free early education , he added			2
despite the progress , he warned that the ‘ disparity between the top and bottom of society is in many cases larger than it has ever been ’			0
‘ we have a group of skilled professionals and wealth creators at the top of society who have little or no connection to those at the bottom			0
‘ yet in so many cases what divides the two is little more than a different start in life			0
‘ i believe social investment gives us an opportunity to lock not just wealth back into our most disadvantaged areas – but something else as well			0
’ mr @entity0 urged the wealthy and big firms to put money into ‘ social enterprises ’ in deprived neighbourhoods .			1
