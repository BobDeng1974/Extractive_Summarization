by @entity0 published : 22:37 est , 16 july 2013 updated : 23:33 est , 16 july 2013 a @entity2 man convicted of fatally shooting a retired sheriff 's deputy during the robbery of an amusement center more than a decade ago was put to death tuesday			1
@entity7 received lethal injection for gunning down 60 - year - old @entity9 at a game room in @entity11 , about 125 miles southwest of @entity12			1
the 2002 slaying came just a few months after @entity7 had been released from prison after serving a sentence for several burglary convictions			2
asked to make a final statement before his execution , @entity7 told his wife he loved her			1
death by lethal injection : in 2002 within months of his parole after multiple 10 - year sentences for burglaries , @entity7 shot and killed a retired sheriff 's deputy during a holdup of a @entity2 amusement center ' thank you for all the years of happiness , ' he said			1
he never acknowledged his victim 's friends or relatives , including two daughters , who watched through a window			2
as the lethal drug began taking effect , he snored about a half dozen times , then stopped breathing			1
at 7:32 p.m. cdt - 15 minutes after being given the drug - he was pronounced dead			2
@entity7 's wife , a @entity38 national who married him by proxy while he was in prison , watched through an adjacent window and sobbed			2
the @entity2 death chamber in @entity43 : @entity2 has executed nine people so far this year @entity7 , 36 , became the ninth @entity2 inmate to receive lethal injection this year and the 501st since the state resumed carrying out capital punishment in 1982			1
his was the first of two executions set for this week ; the other is planned for thursday			2
@entity7 's punishment was carried out after the @entity54 @entity53 refused two last - day appeals			1
his lawyers contended his confession was coerced by authorities threatening to also charge one of his sisters and that the statement improperly was allowed into evidence at his trial in 2004			0
the lawyers obtained affidavits from two jurors who said the confession was a key to their decision to convict him			0
' it is clear that @entity7 would not have been convicted of capital murder if his confession had not been admitted - a fact confirmed by two of his jurors , ' appeals lawyer @entity76 told the high court			0
the appeal also argued @entity7 had deficient legal help during his trial and in earlier stages of his appeals , and that his case would give justices the opportunity to define filing rules in light of recent death penalty rulings from the court			1
the @entity2 attorney general 's office said the appeal was without merit and improperly filed , and that the juror affidavits also were improper			1
' there was n't any coercion whatsoever , ' @entity94 , the former @entity11 district attorney who was lead prosecutor at the trial , recalled last week			0
he also said that while the robbers , who fled with about $ 2,000 , were masked , witnesses were able to ' describe very clearly who the triggerman was			0
' execution room : @entity2 has executed just over 500 inmates since the death penalty was reintroduced in 1976 court records show @entity106 , a retired chief deputy from nearby @entity108 in adjacent @entity109 , was at the game center with his wife on the sunday before @entity112 in 2002 when the gunmen came in through a back door			1
@entity9 approached one of them and grabbed the barrel of the gunman 's rifle ' so no one else was going to be hurt and paid for it dearly , ' @entity94 said			1
he said @entity9 was shot three times , the last one fired while he was on his knees			1
' a very cold killing , ' @entity94 said			0
during questioning by detectives for an unrelated robbery some two months later , @entity7 made references to the still unsolved @entity106 case , then led authorities to a canal where divers recovered items used in the holdup			1
' they had the mask , the guns and his statements saying who did what , ' @entity135 , @entity7 's lead trial lawyer , said			0
' he told them everything			0
' @entity135 said the trial judge overruled his objections and ruled the statements proper and admissible into evidence			0
he also said @entity7 signed affidavits ordering that his defense team present no mitigating evidence during the punishment phase of his trial , where jurors deciding his sentence could have considered he had virtually no parental supervision while growing up			0
' you want to argue your case , completely and totally , ' @entity135 said			0
' in that situation , we 're not being allowed to present our case , based on our client			0
' it 's extremely frustrating			0
' prosecutors bolstered their case for @entity7 's future dangerousness by presenting evidence he attacked a jailer with a homemade weapon while awaiting trial			0
' he did not do himself any favors , ' @entity94 said			0
@entity7 's accomplice , @entity171 , 33 , is serving 60 years for murder and 50 years for aggravated robbery			2
on thursday , another @entity2 inmate is set for lethal injection			1
@entity176 , 41 , is to be executed for a double slaying in @entity178 in 2001 .			2
