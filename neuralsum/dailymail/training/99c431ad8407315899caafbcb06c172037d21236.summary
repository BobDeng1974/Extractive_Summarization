they were nicknamed les poilu , meaning the hairy ones			0
and given the brutal , unrelenting hardships @entity4 soldiers had to face in the @entity5 , that was perhaps understandable			1
now a collection of glass plates has emerged giving a fascinating glimpse into the daily lives of the @entity4 as they defended their homeland between 1914 and 1918			1
it was amassed by a viscount in the @entity15 of the @entity16 , who left behind several boxes containing more than 600 plates taken by an unknown photographer			1
@entity4 cyclists of the @entity22 , on the @entity24 front , eastern @entity25 on september 22 , 1915 @entity4 general @entity26 ( second right ) congratulating and awarding medals to soldiers , who fought in the @entity30 in march 1916 he was employed as staff officer for @entity4 general @entity26 and as part of his duties travelled along the front visiting troops			1
it is not known how he came upon the images , previously unseen by the general public , but they appear to document life around the front during @entity5			1
the collection was found in an attic by a relative of @entity46 - based @entity45 photographer @entity44 , who described them in a blog post			1
mr @entity44 said : ' fortunately most of the plates have indications of the location and date when they were taken , which have helped us identify people and sites when captioning the photos			2
' i checked the information written on the plates with documents available from public sources to verify their accuracy			2
' in my opinion , even if the photographs are not the best of the actual conflict , many of them document the vision that the generals and politicians wanted to present of the war â€“ they show resting soldiers who were well - fed , well - housed and well - treated			2
' as i look at these plates , i think of my own ancestors who fought at @entity30 and wonder how many soldiers in these photographs survived the battle			1
i wonder if some of these soldiers were killed days after being photographed			0
' the photographs do not show casualties , but they do show the reality of life in the trenches : mud , shell - holes , make - shift defences and the imminent prospect of death			0
they also show the soldiers ' sense of humour : a bath - house offers ' free massages for ladies ' and the board outside calls it a ' thermal spa ' , while a dug - out is called ' the chalet '			0
and it shows that some aspects of @entity4 life were unaffected by the war , with the soldiers going to mass in one scene , and in another , @entity110 , the @entity4 commander in chief awards medals with a kiss on the cheek			1
the scene is at @entity30 and in the background is the road to the battleground which became known as ' the sacred way ' because of the scale of sacrifice of @entity4 troops there			1
it has been calculated that every square centimetre of ground was hit by four shells			0
@entity4 officers inspecting trenches on the @entity129 front , eastern @entity25 , in may 1916 a dog pulling a @entity132 machine gun at an unknown location in northern @entity25 a @entity4 soldier after taking a shower , at the rear guard near the front line , at an unknown location in @entity25			1
the placard reads ' thermal complex of the @entity141 , showers , massages , chiropodist , manicurist			0
free massages for women ' the prospects for soldiers like those pictured here were not good			0
the @entity4 mobilised roughly 8.5 million men during the war			2
more than 1.5 million were killed and three million wounded			0
this number represents more than the total number of @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity160 forces combined			0

@entity161 was the @entity158 commander - in - chief during the @entity166 battle a priest conducting mass for @entity4 soldiers on the @entity24 front , eastern @entity25 in 1915 @entity4 soldiers posing outside their shack , called ' @entity173 ' , at @entity174 near @entity175 on the @entity129 front , eastern @entity25 in only the first three months of the war , the @entity4 suffered 350,000 dead alone			1
the infantry , being the most exposed branch , suffered a death rate of roughly 25 per cent with the wounded adding another 40 per cent on top of this - a 65 per cent total casualty rate			0
initially beset by antiquated armaments , systemic disorganisation and poor leadership by the top command , the @entity4 army continued to fight on despite hardships and death an unparalleled death rate			2
battles often dragged on for months , resulting in only minimal gains with losses for both sides in the hundreds of thousands			0
the @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity24 , @entity30 , the @entity166 and the @entity198 : these rank among the bloodiest battles in history			0
yet after 52 months of war , the @entity16 and its allies emerged victorious			2
