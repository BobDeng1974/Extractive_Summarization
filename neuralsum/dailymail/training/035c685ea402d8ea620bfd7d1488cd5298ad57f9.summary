by @entity0 @entity2 boss @entity1 felt his team should have got more than a point after saturday 's @entity6 goalless draw at @entity7			1
the game was one of few real chances , with @entity12 midfielder @entity11 sending one wide when he might have done better and @entity7 goalkeeper @entity13 denying @entity14 and debutant @entity15 , and @entity1 felt his side did enough to win			1
' yeah , i think so , ' said the @entity12 boss , who saw @entity19 sent off in the dying seconds having collected two yellow cards in quick succession			2
chance : debutant @entity15 squandered @entity2 's best chance late on in the game @entity25 : @entity1 's side failed to create many good chances , but @entity1 still thought they should have won he continued on @entity28 1 : ' i thought we had really good control of the game - particularly in the second half			1
we absolutely dominated , but could n't find the moment			2
' when you get a lot of new offensive players , they 're so keen to do well			2
you could almost see @entity11 ( @entity39 ) trying too hard to force the moment			0
you ca n't really do that in football - you have to let the moment come to you			1
' i 'm pleased with the team			0
i think there 's a good solid base to it			0
we know we need to threaten with goals and that will win us games			0
there were a lot of good signs again , but we have n't scored yet and that will be hanging on us			0
' on whether he planned much transfer activity before the window closes on september 1 , he commented : ' we 've got our finger on the pulse , as we 've shown all summer			0
' whether we can get another body in or even two before the window shuts , i do n't know , but i think there will be some movement - maybe one or two going out as well			1
' stalemate : @entity66 was largely untroubled during the @entity6 match at @entity68 unlucky : @entity2 boss @entity1 felt his team were unlucky not to win the match it ’s not too late to play @entity71 … there ’s £ 1,000 to be won every week by the highest scoring manager			1

@entity2 and @entity7 drew 0 - 0 at @entity68
@entity1 felt his side should have won
@entity15 missed *visitors* ' best chance
@entity81 sent off late on for second *bookable* offence
