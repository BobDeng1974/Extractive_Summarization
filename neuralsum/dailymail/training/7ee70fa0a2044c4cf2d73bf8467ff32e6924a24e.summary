mr @entity79 wrote in the letter : ' freedom of speech is an important right but it is not an unqualified one			0
this is especially true for public figures who have the capacity to influence the actions of others			0
' mr @entity2 's tweets would appear to be prima facie evidence that he has committed the offence of encouragement of terrorism as defined by @entity98 ( 2 ) of the @entity99			1
' mr @entity2 may or may not have intended this statement to encourage others to fire rockets from @entity7 into @entity6 , but regrettably he would appear to at least have been reckless as to whether others would be encouraged to commit such acts			1

earlier in the day , he posted the message : ‘ sick of the mantra ( that ) ' @entity6 has the right to defend itself '			0
