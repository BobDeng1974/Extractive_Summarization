last week , for the first time in 15 years , i did n’t go out for my daily run			1
as a veteran of more than 50 marathons and a 100 - mile @entity7 trail race , it takes a lot to stop me			2
but instead of taking in the trees , lawns and ponds of @entity13 ’s @entity12 – the one thing that keeps me sane – i was lying in a hospital bed , the victim of a dog attack that was as vicious as it was wholly unprovoked			1
it nearly took off my leg and left me with scars , skin grafts and serious questions about the way we allow dogs and their owners to menace others – as well as growing doubts about the way our public parks are managed and policed			1
' i screamed for help ' : @entity32 back at the scene of the ' vicious ' and ' unprovoked ' attack in @entity12 do n’t get me wrong : dogs , properly managed , are truly wonderful companions			1
i ’d even go so far as to say i ’m a dog - lover			1
normally i pay no attention , not even to the professional walkers pulled along by packs of three , four or five animals at once – dogs that presumably belong to owners too busy to actually look after them themselves			0
so when , last week , i went for a short , sharp run in @entity12 , family pets were among the last things on my mind			1
i ’ve come to love this magnificent @entity49 park , with its eclectic mix of tourists , lycra - clad cyclists , parakeets and runners of all shapes and sizes			1
and i have also come to love the @entity57 , in which i ’ve occasionally swum on a crisp winter morning			0
for 15 years i ’ve run through the park without incident , bar the time i foolishly ran into a bin and sliced open the top of my thigh			1
a dozen stitches taught me a lesson			0
but bins are to be expected in @entity12 – @entity68 cattle dogs are not			1
they are bred for one purpose : to ‘ nip ’ the heels of cattle being herded across the @entity73 and so keep them in order			2
hence the breed ’s other name – the @entity68 heeler			2
film lovers may remember the character ‘ dog ’ from @entity82 – @entity84 ’s canine companion following the loss of his family			2
well , ‘ dog ’ was an @entity68 cattle dog			2
i never saw this one coming			0
i was gliding past the @entity90 statue and in sight of the @entity92 when the dog homed in on my right leg like a heat - seeking missile			1
my first reaction was to hurl abuse at the two walkers in ‘ control ’ of the half a dozen dogs from which this @entity101 had emerged			0
powerful : the @entity68 cattle dog is bred to herd and ' nip ' the legs of cattle but when i looked down at my foot , all i could see was blood pumping from the wound and a flap of skin the size of a mini pizza dangling from just above my ankle			1
this dog , squat with the shoulders of a weightlifter , had not just ‘ nipped ’ but savaged my leg before sauntering off , its mission presumably accomplished			1
one of the dog walkers ran away , taking his motley crew of mutts with him			2
no doubt he did not have a licence for professional dog - walking , as is required in royal parks			1
the other walker , @entity130 bless him , stayed			0
everything then became a blur			0
i remember screaming for help			0
a runner stopped to offer me comfort and used his top as a tourniquet on my leg while a park employee looked on in disbelief			1
a wonderful elderly gentleman called the police and two friendly constables came to the rescue			0
they looked after me until an ambulance crew arrived to whisk me away – after 30 minutes of form - filling – to @entity148 , @entity149			2
after a night in hospital , copious quantities of morphine , countless blood - pressure tests and heart - rate checks , i was wheeled into theatre for a skin graft from my left thigh			1
the dangling skin could n’t be saved			2
however , i ’m told i should make a full recovery , provided that the antibiotics do their job			0
i ca n’t thank enough the medical staff who took care of me , nor the police who retrieved my clothes from the gym and my keys from work			0
they even visited me after my operation			0
it ’s quite obvious that when i run again – and i will run again , come hell or high water – i ’m going to be nervous when i see a dog walker coming my way , let alone if i spot an @entity68 cattle dog			1
why do people keep dangerous dogs like this muscular vampire cooped up in a cheek - by - jowl city like @entity13 ? is it insecurity ? machismo ? or , more justifiably , as a deterrent to burglars ( the owner , an @entity68 , is an art dealer and lives in swanky @entity188 ) ? this dog is bred to herd by aggression			1
it should be on the other side of the globe at this very moment chasing cattle , not in @entity13 mauling a sub-standard runner			1
imagine how much worse things could have turned out had the victim been a child			0
secondly , given its fearsome reputation and heel - nipping @entity201 , why was n’t the dog on a lead in an area where all dogs are required to be so ? and given the ferocity of the breed , should n’t it at the very least have been muzzled ? under the @entity210 , the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the dog walker ( or in this case , as i have since discovered , the ‘ dog trainer ’ who was walking it )			1
touch wood , he will be prosecuted for not being in control of the dog , but the owner and the animal itself will in all likelihood escape any kind of sanction			0
mr @entity32 's damaged leg was left needing a skin graft the owner has since removed the dog to the countryside , and agreed to have it both muzzled and on a lead when it is taken out , but that ’s probably as far as it will go			1
maybe he will receive a summons when the case against the trainer goes to court , but it ’s not a given			0
he says that the dog has never attacked before but , given that it has been receiving ‘ training ’ , i do n’t believe him			1
the dog has behavioural problems			0
it is unlikely to be destroyed			0
the @entity68 cattle dog is not listed as a dangerous breed under the @entity210			2
and as a dog - lover , i ’m not keen to see it put down			2
but finally , and most worryingly , the whole episode highlights a worrying deterioration in the policing of our royal parks			0
the dog was not seized because most kennel facilities at police stations have been closed due to budget cuts			0
against the rules , the dog was not on a lead , presumably because the walker thought he could get away with it			1
policing is light - touch			0
and the walker who fled had obviously walked dogs there many times before without being required to show a licence			0
i very much doubt that he had ever been asked to produce one			0
@entity13 ’s eight royal parks are patrolled by the @entity271			2
but the pressure to cut police budgets continues , which is all rather worrying when you consider the millions of people who visit these sites every year			0
if we are not careful , @entity13 ’s scantily policed royal parks could become magnets for criminals and thugs – and it wo n’t just be runners who are the victims of violence			2

@entity32 was attacked by @entity287 in @entity12 , @entity13
@entity290 dog ' homed in on him like a heat - seeking missile ' during daily run
left needing surgery and skin grafts for his damaged right leg after charge
breed was bred to herd by aggression and was being walked by a trainer
against park rules the dog was not on a lead at the time of the attack
