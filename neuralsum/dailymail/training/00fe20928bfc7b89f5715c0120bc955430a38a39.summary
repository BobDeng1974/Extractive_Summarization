by @entity0 the recession and the slow recovery have sharply widened the gap between the wealthiest @entity4 and everyone else , according to a new study			2
the richest 5 percent of @entity4 had 24 times the wealth of the median household in 2013 - up substantially from 16.5 times as much in 2007 , according to the report by @entity12 researchers			1
substantial gains in the stock market have enabled richer @entity4 to regain much of their wealth			0
stock prices had plunged by nearly half during the recession but have recovered all their losses and set new highs			0
and roughly 10 percent of households own 80 percent of stocks			0
by contrast , middle - class @entity4 remain further behind because whatever wealth they have is derived mainly from home equity			2
home prices have only partially recovered from the housing bust			0
growing disparity : every income level took a hit in the recession , but the richest households have recovered faster than the median in the first quarter of this year , 18.8 percent of homeowners with a mortgage still owed more on their homes than they were worth , according to real estate data provider @entity39			1
an additional 18.1 percent have so little equity that it would n't be enough to cover closing costs and make a down payment , @entity39 calculates			0
fewer @entity4 even own homes : the home ownership rate fell to 64.8 percent in the first quarter of this year from a peak of 69.2 percent in 2004			2
the @entity12 study found that households at all levels lost wealth during the recession and that not even the top 5 percent have fully regained it			1
the study suggests one reason consumer spending growth has been weaker since the recession than before : when people feel wealthier , they 're more likely to spend			0
most @entity4 may still feel poorer than before the recession and so may still be restraining their spending			0
the losses were n't evenly distributed			0
for the top 5 percent , net worth fell 16 percent from 2007 , just before the recession began , through last year			1
the net worth of the median household fell much further - 43 percent			1
growing disparity : in 2007 , the difference between the top 5percent of home and the median was 16.5 times			1
in 2013 it had grown to 24.2 times stocks have roared back after the recession , leading to the rebound in wealth for the richest @entity4			1
pictures are the @entity74 ( red ) and the @entity75 ( blue ) the study paints a bleaker picture of @entity4 household wealth than do official figures from the @entity81			1
the @entity81 's quarterly report on household wealth has concluded that the nation as a whole regained all the wealth it lost from the recession by the first quarter of 2013			1
but the @entity81 report does n't break out that data for households at different wealth levels			0
its overall figures are lifted by big gains among the wealthiest @entity4			0
@entity96 , assistant research professor at the @entity12 , said the new study might have found less of an overall wealth recovery than the @entity81 did because its sample size was n't big enough to fully capture the richest 2 percent of @entity4			2

the top 5 percent of richest @entity4 were worth 16.5 times as much as the median household in 2007
by 2013 the richest families are were worth more than 24 times the media household
disparity is because stocks and *corporate* profits have recovered , but home values have not
median household wealth *declined* 43 percent between 2007 and 2013 to **$** *56,355*
wealth in the richest 5 percent of families dropped by only 16 percent , **$** *1.4million*
