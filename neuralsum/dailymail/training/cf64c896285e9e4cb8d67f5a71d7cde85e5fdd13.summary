by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 6 november 2012 updated : 08:18 est , 6 november 2012 most people go to university and end up spending a fortune - not making one			0
but a farmer 's son from @entity7 has done just that after he started developing unique fruit crisps in his university digs and is now exporting them around the world			2
@entity11 has now sold more than one million packets of his healthy snack made from apples and pears			1
@entity16 : farmer @entity11 ( pictured ) dreamt up and tested making apple crisps in his student digs and is now exporting them around the world big apple : recent orders of @entity11 's crisps include 100,000 packs to @entity24 and 40,000 to @entity25 the 25 - year - old has taken orders for 100,000 packs from @entity24 , 40,000 from @entity25 and 10,000 from the @entity29 , with the business set to net him over a million pounds in 2013			1
@entity11 began experimenting with making the fruit crisps - the only ones of their kind in the @entity35 - while studying agricultural business management at university in @entity38			1
he turned his student accommodation into a makeshift lab and bought a dehydrator device to dry out slices of the fruit as he experimented with apples in between lectures			1
he has so far refused to supply @entity35 supermarkets because of issues with pricing , preferring to build up relationships with smaller retailers			0
simple : the product contains one simple ingredient - the great @entity35 apple foreign exports : this load of apples is destined for the @entity25 market , which has already ordered tens of thousands of packets ' there was a spare in my university house in my last year there so thought experimenting in making the crisps would be a good way of making some use of it			1
' i had some mixed results to begin with but it turned out quite well			0
' we have had a lot of interest in the fruit crisps			2
' we are making the product ourselves , which is increasingly rare , and that ’s something we pride ourselves on			0
' there has been a great response to what we have done and we ca n’t really keep up with demand at the moment			0
' we ’ll continue to target new markets , that ’s what we are doing with exporting the crisps to other countries as well as getting them into the schools			0
home : @entity11 in the family orchard with the raw material and the farm is expecting the fruit crisp enterprise to make over a million pounds next year from tree to machine : but it all started for @entity11 when he started drying apples in his student house ' but at this stage we are avoiding the supermarkets and looking out for smaller retailers			1
' after finishing his degree at the @entity104 in 2008 , @entity11 used his newfound knowledge to develop his brand of crisps at @entity108 , near @entity109 , @entity7			2
he visited famous @entity112 fruit - growing states such as @entity113 and @entity114 to learn about processing techniques			2
returning to the @entity35 @entity11 used some savings to buy his own equipment and set up production in an on - site cold store on the farm using the apples from the orchards			1
taking on the world : the crisps , made of apple and pears are proving very popular but will not be sold in supermarkets that was when the business really started to take off and @entity11 has n’t looked back since			1
after a trade show six months ago more and more retailers from countries across the globe are now getting in touch with @entity135 about the tasty crisps			0
the global chain @entity137 snapped up the snacks for their five @entity140 shops as well as many other smaller retailers across the country			0
the tasty crisps , which sell for 50 pence a pack , have proved popular with school tuck shops , as one packet counts as one of your five - a - day .			0

@entity11 has taken an order of 100,000 packs from @entity24 alone and hopes to make *£* *1m* next year
it all started in the spare room of his student house in @entity38 where he set up a lab to dry fruit like apples and pears between lectures
