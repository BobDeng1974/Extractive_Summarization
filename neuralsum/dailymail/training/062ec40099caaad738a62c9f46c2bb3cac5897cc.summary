' so it was a remarkable moment the first time we took a measurement from a distance of just 5 centimeters			0
' the ' star ' was recreated in a high - energy facility usually used to simulate nuclear weapon detonations - which fires 26 million amps of current through a container of hydrogen to simulate the hellish 10,000 - degree surface of a white dwarf star			1
the z machine is usually used to simulate nuclear weapon detonations , but 15 per cent of the high energy facility 's time is devoted to experiments - including a simulation of the surface of a white dwarf star , created by firing a huge amount of electricity into hydrogen gas the ' @entity32 ' was built to simulate nuclear weapon detonations , but now devotes around 15 per cent of its time to experiments such as the star simulation , reports @entity37			1
the machine produces huge amounts of energy - enough to melt diamonds			2
it has generated temperatures of 3.7 billion @entity44 , the highest ever created by humankind , including the centre of hydrogen bomb explosions			2
it also routinely generates electrical power equivalent to 80 times @entity51 's total power output			1
in the ' white dwarf ' experiment , researchers simulated the ' spectrum ' of a white dwarf 's surface by firing 26 million amps of electricity through tungsten wires , which vapourises them , releasing x-rays			1
when the x-rays hit a container of hydrogen gas , it ionises and reaches a temperature of around 10,000 degrees centigrade , to recreate the conditions on the surface of a star			1
@entity5 's team have been experimenting with the @entity32 since 2010			0
' everyone assumes we know hydrogen so well , ' @entity5 said			0
' as it turns out , that 's not the case			0
' when the z machine fires , 36 cables - each with the same girth as a horse 's torso - fire simultaneously , triggered by laser switches			1
the cables , insulated by water , fire a pulse of 50 trillion watts into a target the size of a spool of thread			0
while the z machine can generate an extraordinary pulse of energy , it only does so for a tiny fraction of a second - the power used is only enough to provide electricity for 100 houses for two minutes , and is supplied by the local electricity company via a wall socket .			2

machine can output power equivalent to 80 times @entity51 's total consumption
usually used to simulate nuclear blasts , now recreating the surface of a star
fires huge burst of x-rays into hydrogen container to recreate white dwarf
