@entity0 has stuck by her defense of the prisoner exchange that led to the release of @entity4 saying that the priority was to get the @entity7 soldier back no matter what led to his capture			1
‘ we want to get an @entity7 home , whether they fell off the ship because they were drunk or they were pushed or they jumped , we try to rescue everybody , ’ she said in an interview with @entity11 as part of her book tour			1
' that 's part of who we are , and that sets us apart from a lot of other countries in the world who cheapen life , who do n't care			2
' explaining the process : @entity0 reportedly initially refused a similar plan to exchange prisoners for @entity4 but now she is reiterating the @entity36 ' defense of the swap the flippant remark comes as a debate rages on about the lengths to which the administration went to rescue @entity4 who is believed to have willingly left the base and deserted his @entity44 mission in @entity45 before being captured by the @entity46 in 2009			1
she also elaborated about the five @entity46 leaders who were released from @entity48 , saying that in spite of the outcry from both the public and political leaders , she does not think that @entity7 safety has been put in jeopardy as a result of their release			1
‘ these five guys are not a threat to the @entity7 , ’ she told @entity11 ’s @entity58			1
‘ they are a threat to the safety and security of @entity45 and @entity64			0
it 's up to those two countries to make the decision once and for all that these are threats to them			2
so i think we may be kind of missing the bigger picture here			0
’ principle : @entity73 says that the @entity4 swap was necessary to keep up the @entity7 adage of getting all military personnel home this comes after it was revealed that while she was secretary of state , @entity73 opposed the idea of a prisoner swap for @entity4 because she did not trust the terrorist groups that they would undoubtedly return to once released			1
her aides have contradicted those reports , and she has remained publicly supportive of the move			0
her spokesman @entity89 said specifically that she ‘ set a high bar and insisted on strict conditions for any deal ’ , offering that as an insight into why no such swap took place under her tenure			0
‘ you do n't want to see these five prisoners go back to combat			2
there 's a lot that you do n't want to have happen			0
on the other hand you also do n't want an @entity7 citizen , if you can avoid it , especially a solider , to die in captivity , ’ she said last week			2
‘ this young man , whatever the circumstances , was an @entity7 citizen - is an @entity7 citizen - was serving in our military ... the idea that you really care for your own citizens and particularly those in uniform , i think is a very noble one			1
’ making the rounds : @entity73 's interview is one in a series of public appearances to promote her book , and on wednesday she was in @entity126 sharing the stage with @entity128 , the city 's mayor who used to work for her husband her interview comes as part of the publicity roll out for her book @entity136 , which went on sale tuesday			0
the @entity11 interview aired tuesday night and just hours later , defense secretary @entity139 was seated in front of the @entity141 to testify about his knowledge of the planning process of the prisoner exchange - specifically answering why the administration did not notify @entity147 leaders 30 days before @entity4 was released			1
‘ @entity150 was not on our side , ’ @entity148 said during his testimony wednesday morning			0
' since the time he went missing we 've been looking for ways to get him back			0
' this was the best possibility to get him out because we were concerned that we might lose him			0

@entity0 defends the @entity36 's decision to swap five @entity46 leaders for @entity4
said that the principle that the @entity7 always gets their military service *members* back home is more *important* than the release of the prisoners
' these five guys are not a threat to the @entity7 , ' she said
