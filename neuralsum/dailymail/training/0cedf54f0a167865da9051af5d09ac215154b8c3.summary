@entity0 can not become red , white can not become black , and stripes can not become hoops			0
the sacred law of football kits will be broken by @entity6 next summer when they play in hoops instead of stripes for the first time in their 115 - year history			1
@entity6 ’s first ever kit in 1899 was red and blue halves but by 1910 the halves had become stripes and for the most part that is the way things have stayed			1
when the team won their first @entity20 in 1992 at @entity21 the players went up the old stadium ’s famous 39 steps in orange shorts and red and blue striped shirts			1
@entity6 are reverting to hooped home shirts for the first time in their 115 - year history , revealed by @entity27 @entity6 celebrate winning the @entity20 against @entity28 back in 2009 @entity29 wears the traditional striped jersey during a triumphant season three years ago @entity31 and @entity32 ( pictured in 1992 ) alongside @entity33 back in 1974 @entity35 striker ronaldo celebrating scoring against @entity37 for @entity6 during the 1996 - 97 season they had worn their orange second kit in the win over @entity42 but to a man they had changed back into the classic number for one of the most famous photos in the club ’s history as they collected and posed with the trophy			1
the stripes have become wider and narrower as time has past			0
from 1929 to 1940 only two blue stripes were visible on the front of the shirts			1
in 1949 a third blue stripe can be seen running down the middle and that is the way things stayed until 1999 when the centenary was marked by a return to the halves they had worn when they were founded			1
halves were also used in 2008 - 09 when the club won its third @entity20			0
@entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 celebrating eight years ago @entity71 alongside coach @entity72 in 2009 ( with @entity73 and @entity29 watching on ) there have been some major deviations from the traditional in the form of second and third strips over the years			0
in the 2002 - 03 season the second kit was golden with a red and blue line down the middle and the third kit had a @entity84 sash			2
pistachio green and luminous yellow have featured and the kids were really let loose in the crayon factory two seasons ago when the famous lollipop kit was presented			0
its orange fading into yellow reminded supporters of a popsicle and was binned after one season			2
but messing about with the second and third strips has always been seen as fair game for shirt manufacturers who have to come up with new ideas every season			2
@entity102 scores the second goal in a 4 - 0 win against @entity28 at the @entity105 in 1994 - 95 @entity106 celebrates scoring in the same game against @entity28 in @entity6 's famed stripes @entity110 @entity109 ( left ) and @entity35 @entity111 celebrate after the former scored against @entity112 in 1999 but touching the home shirt still ranks as blasphemy			1
you might expect from an eccentric foreign owner with little sense of a club ’s roots			0
but when the idea has come from , or been accepted by the club ’s board , questions will be asked			0
early indications are that fans are 70 - 30 against the innovation , there is still time for a rethink .			0

@entity6 will wear hooped shirts from the start of next season
the @entity134 have worn striped shirts for the majority of their history
*giants* have also opted for halved home jerseys on *occasion*
