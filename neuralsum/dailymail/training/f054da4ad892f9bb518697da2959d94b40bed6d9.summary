by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:07 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 02:38 est , 22 november 2012 plans for secret courts were left in tatters last night by the @entity5			1
peers voted by crushing majorities for fundamental changes to the @entity9 , which would allow civil cases involving national security to be conducted in secret			1
by margins of over 100 votes , peers voted to remove ministers ’ exclusive right to apply for secret hearings and to give judges ultimate discretion in deciding whether or not they should be held behind closed doors			1
as the legislation was introduced in the @entity5 , the government ’s plans came under devastating attack from several of @entity26 ’s most senior retired judges and politicians			1
peers voted by crushing majorities for fundamental changes to the @entity9 strong views : lord @entity31 backed a string of proposed changes to the legislation the defeats suggest ministers will have to return to the drawing board and accept a series of amendments – or risk seeing the entire piece of legislation thrown out			1
critics say the government ’s proposals will seriously threaten @entity26 ’s reputation for open and fair justice			1
the @entity48 has led criticism of the plans to allow so - called ‘ closed material procedures ’ ( @entity52 ) , in which cases are conducted entirely in private , in any civil hearing			0
defendants or claimants will not be allowed to be present , or know or challenge the case against them , and must be represented by a security - cleared special advocate , rather than their own lawyer			0
currently , such procedures are used in tiny numbers of immigration and deportation hearings , but the government wants to extend them across the civil courts in cases deemed to involve national security			2
the legislation has been drafted in close co-operation with the security services , which have claimed other countries may stop sharing intelligence with @entity26 if it risks being disclosed in open court			1
but crossbencher @entity76 , a leading lawyer , described the measures as a ‘ radical departure from the principles of common law ’			0
how the mail led the campaign.jpg leading a series of amendments to the plans , he said : ‘ this is a departure from the principle of transparent justice			2
we should be very careful in that a @entity84 is inherently damaging to the integrity of the judicial process			0
‘ judicial decisions are respected precisely because all the evidence is heard in open court subject to acceptance and judges give a reasoned judgment which explains their decision			2
’ former @entity102 chief @entity101 said secret court hearings should be introduced so @entity26 spies can defend themselves against allegations of torture			1
she said : ‘ it is deeply distressing to me and to my former colleagues to be accused of inequities in cases of torture and maltreatment			0
we have not been able to defend ourselves			0
’ she claimed that presenting classified information in open court would put the lives of secret agents at risk			1
but @entity119 peer @entity118 of @entity120 said the new legislation failed the ‘ smell test ’			0
he warned that closed hearings could begin as a ‘ rare event but will over time morph into the default position ’			2
@entity126 , @entity127 , the former director of public prosecutions , accused the government of reneging on a pledge to allow judges to have the final say on whether there should be a secret court hearing			2
lord @entity118 and @entity101 have made their opinions clear on the legislation ‘ these amendments would give judges appropriate discretion to balance the interests of national security with justice , ’ he said			2
historian @entity142 , a @entity144 peer , opposed the expansion of secret courts because it would mean a ‘ tilting of the balance away from the free individual towards the interest of the state ’			0
labour justice spokesman @entity31 backed a string of proposed changes to the legislation , saying the government ’s proposals constituted a ‘ radical departure from the cornerstone of our legal system – the right of a party to know and to challenge his opponent ’s case ’			1
he said : ‘ these amendments place the judge firmly in control of the process with the means to balance the interests of justice and security , protecting from disclosure what is essential not to be made public			0
’ advocate general for @entity178 lord @entity177 , replying for the government , said that at present people assumed the government settled controversial cases because there had been ‘ some wrongdoing ’ whereas in fact it was often that relevant material could not be put before the court			0
he said there were currently 20 civil damages cases where material ‘ relating to national security would be central ’			0
@entity191 , of the human rights group @entity192 , said : ‘ these amendments are a small step in the right direction , but the reality is that secret courts in any form are deeply dangerous			0
' the only way to protect our centuries - old tradition of open and equal justice is for @entity203 to reject plans for secret courts altogether			1

@entity207 voted to remove ministers ' exclusive right to apply for secret hearings
