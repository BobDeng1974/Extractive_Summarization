it would be the first time in history that a ' cetacean ' - the order of animals including whales , dolphins and porpoises - has been wiped out by human activity			1
@entity17 's dolphins , found near @entity18 , drown after becoming trapped in the heavy duty nylon fishing mesh - and fewer than 22 breeding females are left in the world			1
doomed dolphin ? mauis dolphins are found only in shallow waters off @entity18 , where the population has been decimated by trawl and gillnets - huge walls of nylon netting used to catch fish net loss : numbers have fallen by 94 per cent since gillnet fishing began in the 1970s , an international conference on whaling in @entity34 heard this week deadly catch : the species downfall would be the first known extinction of a marine cetacean as a direct result of human activities @entity17 ’s dolphins are found only in shallow waters off @entity18 , where the population has been ‘ decimated ’ by gillnets - huge walls of nylon netting used to catch fish			1
numbers have fallen by 94 per cent since gillnet fishing began in the 1970s , an international conference on whaling in @entity34 heard this week			2
the species ’ downfall would be the first known extinction of a marine cetacean as a direct result of human activities			2
dr @entity59 , head of endangered species conservation for the @entity62 environmental charity , @entity61 , who has worked to protect the species for more than a decade including for the @entity18 @entity65 , warned that gillnets are only part of the problem			0
these findings were presented to the @entity70 ( @entity70 ) annual meeting in @entity72			0
she said : ‘ make no mistake that these beautiful dolphins are well on their way to doing a dodo , and the @entity18 government is well aware of this			0
‘ unless something happens immediately , and the @entity18 government takes notice , the only place you ’ll find a @entity17 ’s dolphin will be stuffed in a museum			1
’ the @entity17 dolphin - the world 's smallest - is under threat from fishing and just 55 individuals are left only found on the west coast of @entity18 , there may be as little as 20 breeding females left , a new study has found the dolphins have fallen prey to fishing nets @entity61 said the @entity96 - of which the @entity17 ’s dolphin is a critically - endangered sub-species - is also facing extinction			1
@entity61 is now urging @entity18 to ban harmful fishing methods in waters up to 100m deep to save the species			0
dr @entity102 suggests more selective fishing methods , such as hook and line fishing , or fish traps , which do not catch dolphins , could be used instead			0
she added : ‘ the @entity18 government has been exposed to fierce pressure from fishing interests , which strongly oppose any measures to protect these rare dolphins			0
‘ the industry insists that fishermen do n’t catch the dolphins , but we found that less than one percent of dolphins killed in nets are reported			0
‘ @entity61 sincerely hopes that @entity18 will finally show the commitment and leadership required to save the @entity17 ’s and @entity122 ’s dolphins .			2

' if we do *n't* act , the only place you *'ll* find a @entity17 's dolphin is stuffed in a museum ' says *researcher*
fewer than 22 breeding females are left in the wild
