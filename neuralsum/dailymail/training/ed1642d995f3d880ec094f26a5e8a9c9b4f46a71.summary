the first atomic bomb test in july 16 , 1945 marks the beginning of the @entity4 – a new chapter of the @entity7 ’s geological history , an international group of scientists has proposed			1
they say that humans are having such a marked impact on the @entity7 that we are changing its geology , to create distinctive new layers of rock and soil			1
the use of nuclear weapons , and their nuclear fallout , has left an indelible mark , combined with a ‘ great acceleration ’ of other human activity			1
a photo of a giant column of smoke rising over @entity29 , @entity30 , where the second atomic bomb was dropped , is shown the new geological epoch - the name of which means the human epoch - was proposed by @entity35 - winning atmospheric chemist @entity36 just 15 years ago , and since then the idea has caught on			2
however , the precise date it began is being debated by experts			2
@entity41 a geology professor at the @entity43 , said : ‘ like any geological boundary , it is not a perfect marker – levels of global radiation really rose in the early 1950s , as salvoes of bomb tests took place			2
‘ but it may be the optimal way to resolve the multiple lines of evidence on human - driven planetary change			0
time - and much more discussion - will tell			0
’ experts have debated when the @entity4 should begin , because humans have been affecting the environment for thousands of years – during the @entity61 in 18th century @entity62 , for example			1
the new geological epoch ( shown at the bottom of this diagram ) - the name of which means the human epoch - was proposed by @entity35 - winning atmospheric chemist @entity36 just 15 years ago , and since then the idea has caught on the first atomic bomb test took place on july 16 , 1945 at the @entity74 ’s test range in @entity75 , @entity76			1
scientists say that that first blast marks the beginning of a new geological epoch – the anthropocene			0
while other dates are being discussed , a working group claims this historical landmark is appropriate because nuclear tests and weapons have left an indelible mark on the @entity7 by changing its geology			1
a ‘ great acceleration ’ of population , carbon emissions , species invasions and extinctions and the production of concrete , plastics and metals in vast quantities , since that date , also makes it appropriate			1
but members of the working group have suggested the turning point happened in the mid-twentieth century			1
this was when humans did not just leave traces of their actions , but began to alter the whole @entity7 system			0
there was a ‘ great acceleration ’ of population , of carbon emissions , of species invasions and extinctions , of earth moving , of the production of concrete , plastics and metals , they said			1
it included the start , too , of the nuclear age , when artificial radionuclides were scattered across the @entity7 , to leave a detectable signal in modern strata virtually everywhere on the planet			2
dr @entity41 , who chairs the @entity4 working group set up by the @entity127 , said the @entity4 could be considered to be drawn at the moment of detonation of the world ’s first nuclear test			1
the proposal has been signed by 26 members of the group , created by the body that oversees changes to the geological timeline			0
the beginning of the nuclear age marks the historic turning point when humans first accessed an enormous new energy source - and is also a time level that can be effectively tracked within geological strata – layers of rocks and soil			2
the start of the nuclear age , which coincides with the beginning of widely used and thrown away plastic objects ( illustrated with a stock image ) , can be effectively tracked within geological strata – layers of rocks and soil , the experts said the date at which the @entity4 started is the subject of debate			1
a total of 26 members of a working party that have backed it to begin at the start of atominc testing , but the beginning of the industrial revolution was mulled too			0
an image of the first iron bridge , built by @entity169 engineers is shown previous ‘ divisions ’ between geological eras have been marked by ' spikes ' in the geological records , caused by global catastrophes such as the asteroid strike thought to be responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs , or a wave of volcanic eruptions			0
dr @entity41 said : ‘ like any geological boundary , it is not a perfect marker – levels of global radiation really rose in the early 1950s , as salvoes of bomb tests took place			0
‘ but it may be the optimal way to resolve the multiple lines of evidence on human - driven planetary change			0
time - and much more discussion - will tell			0
’ this year , the @entity193 will put together more evidence on the new geological epoch , including discussion of possible alternative time boundaries			0
in 2016 , the group aims to make recommendations on whether this new time unit should be formalised and , if so , how it might be defined and characterised			2
after the testing of atomic weapons began , there was a ‘ great acceleration ’ of population , of carbon emissions , of species invasions and extinctions , of earth moving , of the production of concrete , plastics and metals , the experts said			1
a night view of a busy street in @entity217 is pictured			0

a working group led by a @entity43 scientist has proposed that july 16 , 1945 should mark the start of the @entity4 epoch
they say nuclear weapons have left a mark on the @entity7 *'s* geology
a ' great acceleration ' of human activity has also changed its rocks and soil
date is being debated by experts and could be formalised from 2016
