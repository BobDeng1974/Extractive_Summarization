@entity0 : @entity2 columnist @entity1 wrote a piece this week , criticizing the labeling of @entity5 as a symbol of the @entity8 movement when @entity5 was shot in the @entity12 , @entity11 suburb of @entity13 last summer , like many other african - americans , @entity1 was incensed by the seemingly senseless death of another young black teen			1
but in a new column for the @entity2 , @entity1 says he no longer believes @entity5 is an appropriate symbol for the renewed civil rights movement in the @entity19 and that white police officer @entity20 was justified in the shooting			1
when @entity5 was shot dead on august 9 , 2014 , early reports said he was holding his hands in the air , surrendering , and asking @entity20 not to shoot			1
in the mass outrage that swept through the predominantly - black community following his death , many used ' hands up , do n't shoot ' as a rallying cry			0
@entity1 says the release of federal investigations into the shooting , and the @entity33 in general , this month have forced him to re-evaluate @entity5 as a victim			1
the investigation revealed that @entity5 had not in fact had his arms up when he was shot , based on witness testimonies and autopsy results			0
that story line mainly stems from @entity5 's friend @entity41 , who was walking with him the day he was shot			1
in his interview with the press , @entity41 's details of the shooting continued to change			0
' the @entity47 report notes on page 44 that @entity41 “ made multiple statements to the media immediately following the incident that spawned the popular narrative that @entity20 shot @entity5 execution - style as he held up his hands in surrender " ' in one of those interviews , @entity41 said that @entity5 was shot in the back by @entity20			2
it was then that @entity41 said @entity5 stopped , turned around with his hands up and said , “ i do n’t have a gun , stop shooting ! ” and , like that , “ hands up , do n’t shoot ” became the mantra of a movement			2
' but it was wrong , built on a lie , ' @entity1 wrote			0
new evidence : @entity1 said the new federal investigation results show that white police officer @entity20 ( right ) was justified in killing @entity5 ( left ) ' based on a lie ' : in the aftermath of the shooting , @entity5 's friend and witness @entity41 ( center ) , said his hands were up in surrender when he was shot			1
but those statements were refuted in the official investigation , which reported that @entity5 was running towards @entity20 when he was shot based on the investigation 's damning results , @entity1 says @entity5 is now an ' inappropriate symbol ' for the @entity8 movement			1
however , he says that the new information should not ' diminish the importance of the real issues ' sparked by his death			2
in fact , @entity1 said , the investigation into the @entity33 showed law enforcement in the community had been blatantly ' trampling ' on the constitutional rights of residents who are mostly @entity91 , which explains why the community ' exploded the moment @entity5 was killed			2
' @entity1 said it 's ' imperative that we continue marching for and giving voice to those killed in racially charged incidents at the hands of police and others			2
' real issues : @entity1 says that though @entity5 in an ' inappropriate symbol ' of the @entity8 movement , it should n't distract from the the very real issues that were sparked by his death ' but we must never allow ourselves to march under the banner of a false narrative on behalf of someone who would otherwise offend our sense of right and wrong			1
and when we discover that we have , we must acknowledge it , admit our error and keep on marching			0
that ’s what i ’ve done here , ' @entity1 said			0
in the aftermath of the column , @entity1 elicited a slew of negative comments from readers on @entity127 , but he was also lauded by others for his bravery in reversing his opinion on the @entity13 shooting			0
@entity133 anchor @entity132 said on her show that she supported the column and @entity1 for being ' brave enough to admit he was wrong '			0
on @entity127 , @entity1 described the column as ' the hardest piece i 've ever had to write ' .			0

@entity2 columnist @entity1 says new evidence shows @entity20 was justified in shooting @entity5
however , he says that the new evidence should n't *detract* from the important issues sparked by @entity5 's death
