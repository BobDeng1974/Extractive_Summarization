@entity1 manager @entity0 admits his side face a difficult task against @entity3 on sunday @entity1 striker @entity22 celebrates after scoring a penalty against @entity24 on thursday ' too many times you see a team that go for being a parasite ; they give you the ball , defend , be destructive , ' @entity0 said			1
' that system does n't develop players			2
it 's the opposite â€“ every two years they burn players			2
they need new players and they need new players to do things players do n't enjoy doing			0
' i believe the way the game should be played is in a specific manner ; taking risks , and getting on the ball and relying on the talent of the players to score goals			0
' @entity51 manager @entity50 has been criticised for his team 's style of play this season , while @entity58 's @entity57 teams have been dubbed anti-football in the past			1

' meanwhile , @entity0 has told @entity96 winger @entity70 , who has been linked with a move away from @entity98 , that he must remain patient over a new contract			1
@entity70 is understood to want to open negotiations over improved terms but must bide his time			0
' are we in talks ? not at the moment , ' @entity0 explained			1
' we 're going to leave every individual situation until further down the line			0
' i do feel that talking about individual situations can be distracting at this point			0
' we 'll look at the players who are out of contract first and foremost because they 're more urgent but players like @entity70 who has two - and - a - half years left on his contract is not something we need to consider yet			0
