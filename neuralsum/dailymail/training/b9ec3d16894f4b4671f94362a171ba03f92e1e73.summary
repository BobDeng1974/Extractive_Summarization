for the adventure seekers among us , going on specialised tours can really make it a holiday to remember			2
but some experiences around the world are more extreme than others , even putting holidaymakers at risk of arrest			0
from @entity11 's so - called @entity10 - a mountain - side route that tourists tackle on bikes - to the experience of being ' arrested ' by @entity17 secret police in @entity18 , here are some of the most extreme tours that holidaymakers pay for around the world			1
memories of the horrific nuclear blast remain for tourists to see on the @entity27 tour contamination levels are now low enough for coach tours to visit the @entity27 power plant the @entity32 - @entity31 the @entity27 site , the scene of the worst nuclear disaster since @entity36 , has become a tourist attraction			1
local government tour guides are now escorting buses of people through the area , explaining what has become of the disaster zone			2
back in 2011 , three of the @entity45 's six reactors blew up following a tsunami , releasing radioactive gases that meant the whole area had to be evacuated			0
however , with contamination levels said to be ' low ' , people are being permitted on whistle - stop tours to view the desolate and abandoned place			2
tourists who visit @entity18 get the chance to experience the terrors of a @entity17 bunker holidaymakers must sign a waiver before agreeing to sign up for the @entity17 @entity60 the @entity17 @entity61 - @entity18 @entity18 offers a chance for holidaymakers to experience what life was like under the control of the @entity17 - using real dogs and former @entity69 officers , and taking place in a former @entity17 bunker			1
the terrifying experience starts with visitors being ' ambushed ' by the @entity74 in the middle of the forest , 15 miles from the capital @entity78 , before being transported down into the bunker for a three - hour @entity17 experience			1
before taking part in the experience , which is called 1984 : the @entity84 , holidaymakers are asked to sign a waiver , which includes a clause stating : ' in case of disobedience participants may receive psychological or physical punishments			0
' @entity90 are led to the border with the @entity92 all for show in the @entity94 the @entity94 - @entity90 a small town in @entity90 has set up a quasi-theme park that offers visitors the chance to experience what @entity90 immigrants go through when they illegally cross the @entity92 border			1
for approximately $ 20 ( £ 13 ) , tourists visiting @entity103 can spend their saturday night getting a three - hour simulated experience of what it is like to be a migrant attempting to cross the border			1
participants in the @entity110 , which translates as ' night walk ' , go on a challenging trek where they must evade ' immigration officials ' and ' border patrol agents ' as they flee through rough terrain			0
of course , unlike the millions of migrants who illegally cross into the @entity92 , the tourists ’ lives are in no real danger			2
a worst case scenario here would be a nasty fall			0
@entity123 - @entity122 the @entity125 country has cocaine ' factory ' tours high up in the mountains of the @entity129			1
holidaymakers willing to take extreme risks can work with local guides to visit poverty - stricken farmers who gamble with their lives in a desperate bid to provide for their families			2
tours of the illegal farms can cost as little as $ 9 ( £ 6 ) , but tourists put themselves at risk from paramilitaries operating in the area - who have been known to kidnap foreigners and hold them years at a time - or arrest by local police			1
both experiences are highly illegal and even seeking them out can put foreign travellers at risk of arrest or attack by drug traffickers or paramilitaries			0
those who take part in the underground tours can be arrested even if they are just caught on the property of the drug - makers			2
many people like taking on a bungee jump , but would you fancy doing one over a crocodile - infested river ? @entity167 - infested @entity166 / @entity165 border tourists can leap head first from the @entity170 over the crocodile - infested @entity171			1
however , back in 2012 , then 22 - year - old @entity174 @entity173 took on the bungee challenge , with almost fatal consequences			1
after flying off the bridge , her rope snapped and she plunged into the water , feet still bound			0
her rope got caught on rocks , but that was the least of her trouble with crocodiles swarming			0
miraculously , she managed to untangle the rope , and swim to safety with just cuts , bruises and a broken collarbone			0
tourists get the chance to explore the @entity191 mines of @entity192 , with dynamite strapped to their backs mining with @entity196 in the @entity198 of @entity192 , @entity11 , you can crawl around in the gravel with dynamite strapped to your back			1
not only that , but you are handed 95 per cent proof alcohol to give you the @entity204 courage to continue on your quest			0
but once you 've polished off the tipple , be prepared to put your mask on , as the dynamite show begins - the walls of the mines shake and disintegrate around you			2
not one for the faint - hearted			0
@entity211 allow visitors to get up close and personal to @entity213 in @entity92 's @entity214 @entity215 's @entity214 @entity211 will take guests to within a quarter of a mile of some of the swirling 300mph vertical wind funnels			0
storm - chasers @entity219 and @entity221 are now taking @entity223 punters on the hunt of their lives following deadly and destructive tornados			0
ploughing their way through ' @entity229 ' , the couple drive groups of up to 18 people in three buses and charge up to £ 230 a day for a ten - day chase			0
at 15,400ft , the @entity10 in @entity11 is a favourite spot for thrill - seeking cyclists the @entity235 - @entity11 at 15,400f , @entity11 's @entity236 - better known as ' the @entity10 ' - is among the nation 's biggest draw cards for thrill - seeking tourists , even though it is estimated that 300 people die here every year			1
dubbed ' @entity10 ' ( the @entity10 ) by locals , for obvious reasons , and considered by many the most dangerous stretch of road in the world , the 40 - mile journey from its summit entices in excess of 25,000 mountain bike riders annually			1
the ride takes in the stunning views among the rolling hills of the @entity254 rainforest , but come with the somewhat distracting - and for some terrifying - sheer drop into the canopy as two rubber tyres separate the rider from a narrow single - lane road with very little in the way of railings			0
for the locals , the ' @entity10 ' is an important transport route which they brave in cars and trucks , teetering on the edge and risking their lives with every trip			2
for companies such as @entity11 , a cycling tour company that offers riders the opportunity to experience the once in a lifetime journey through clouds and waterfalls , it 's big business .			1

@entity31 offers tourists a tour of the *obliterated* @entity27 power plant
crocodile - infested bungee jumping in the @entity171 has obvious *warnings*
@entity10 in @entity11 is tackled by cyclists as well as *motorists*
visitors can go on a ' make your own cocaine ' tour in @entity122
