by @entity0 @entity2 soldiers will desert @entity4 ’s independent army to fight alongside their @entity6 comrades if the @entity7 wins next year ’s referendum			1
a devastating new study which quizzed servicemen has left the @entity11 ’ defence blueprint in tatters , concluding that mr @entity4 ’s proposals ‘ do not withstand serious scrutiny ’			1
for the first time , serving soldiers were asked for their views and ‘ a majority – perhaps even a large majority ’ would prefer to remain with the @entity19 ’ because they will see action instead of spending their time in @entity2 ' thumb twiddling ’			2
one soldier was undecided and another admitted he would join the @entity39 for an easier life , adding : ‘ all we ’d be doing is checking passports on the @entity44			0
’ one officer questioned why a young @entity2 man would sign up to ‘ sit on the border in @entity48 or @entity49 with a blue beret and no rounds in his rifle ’ when he could instead train at @entity54 and join an elite fighting force			0
the findings have raised fears of a ‘ two - tier ’ military structure in @entity2 , with the brightest and best youngsters choosing to defend @entity6 before transferring to the @entity39 once they are married , have children and want to ‘ calm down a bit later in life ’			1
@entity2 would also need its own special forces to protect the @entity65 oil rigs , but there would be a major recruitment crisis because the job would involve ‘ thumb twiddling ’			2
other findings in the 128 - page report from the highly respected @entity72 include : the report , launched in @entity74 today , has been written by defence expert and author @entity76			0
he has previously provided briefings to the @entity79 ( @entity79 ) and the @entity80 at @entity54			0
latest figures show that @entity2 ’s notional share of the @entity6 ’s defence budget was nearly £ 3.3billion in 2011 - 12			1
the @entity7 has drawn up plans to spend £ 2.5billion on a 15,000 - strong @entity2 military if there is a ‘ yes ’ vote in next year ’s referendum , although it claims this is around £ 500million more than is currently spent within @entity2 ’s borders			1
check point : the report is a devastating blow to @entity2 first minister @entity4 , who yesterday launched the official 2014 @entity93 at @entity94 of @entity2 mill in @entity96 , @entity97 with tournament director @entity98 mr @entity76 ’s report concludes that ‘ if one is being objective on this subject , it is almost impossible not to arrive at the conclusion that – as things currently stand – defence policy is one of the @entity7 ’s weak points ’			1
‘ this is not because they have attempted to put forward a fully thought - through defence strategy that nevertheless appears to have some deficiencies , but rather because their strategy appears to be predicated more on how not to alienate voters , than on how to actually defend @entity2			2
’ he adds : ‘ it is the considered conclusion of this report that not only have the @entity7 failed to answer most questions adequately to date , but that any – if not the majority – of their proposals for defence do not withstand serious scrutiny			2
’ the @entity7 wants to keep all of @entity2 ’s historic @entity125 regiments , but that would require around 14,000 personnel – leaving just 1,000 for an air force and a navy			1
and one of the major problems would be persuading @entity2 soldiers to desert the @entity19			0
one officer told the report ’s author : ‘ what of the young officer born , raised , and educated in @entity2 ? he can either join the @entity138 [ @entity125 @entity138 ] or the local @entity2 regiment			2
‘ if he chooses the latter , he can not go to @entity54 ; so he would be going to a new training school in @entity2 , with the best hope of going and sitting on the border in @entity48 or @entity49 with a blue beret and no rounds in his rifle			0
‘ or he can join the @entity138 , one of the most recognisable regiments in the world			0
what ’s he going to do ? it ’s a no brainer ; the @entity39 would be too dead - end and too parochial			1
’ the officer said the @entity39 would be staffed by ‘ second - class @entity2 soldiers ’			0
elite : @entity2 troops would prefer to train at @entity54 in @entity156 ( pictured ) before fighting on the frontline around the world , instead of joining peacekeeping operations with a @entity2 force defence experts professor sir @entity161 told mr @entity76 : ‘ i can envisage a two - tier military service , where ambitious young @entity2 join the @entity125 , and then , once he ’s married and got children and wants to calm down a bit later in life , he transfers to the @entity167			1
’ the report outlines potential massive job losses in the shipyards and at the @entity172 naval base on the @entity173 , where the @entity6 ’s @entity175 nuclear missile system is based			1
but it also warns of the impact on defence companies			0
‘ privately , concerns have been raised about the potential loss of access to the world ’s second - largest defence market , and there have been some discussions about the possibility of relocation south of the border in the event of a ‘ yes ’ vote in 2014 , ’ it claims			1
criticism : @entity193 's shadow defence secretary @entity192 said the @entity7 's plans are @entity196 defence plans are ' quarter - baked ' ‘ one well - placed source told this report that , following discussions he had had with the board of one of the big defence companies , ‘ they said quite clearly that , if @entity2 became independent , they would move their operation out from near @entity74 ’			1
the company in question employs several thousand people in @entity2 who , the source said , would consequently lose their jobs			0
’ addressing military infrastructure , the study found that the @entity213 would likely be too ‘ expensive and complex ’ for a separate @entity2 , while the ageing @entity215 ‘ lacks an air - to - air capability ’ and the @entity217 trainer is ‘ comparatively slow , with no radar and only limited offensive capability ’			1
‘ therefore , it would be unable to fulfil the air - defence function envisaged by the party , ’ the report states			0
the study also suggests that purchasing four diesel - powered submarines would cost @entity2 up to £ 2.6billion , which is described as ‘ prohibitive ’			0
shadow defence secretary @entity192 said : ‘ it ’s official			0
the @entity7 defence plans are quarter - baked			0
‘ there ’s a growing army of experts who have shown just how flawed their defence plans are			0
the defence and security of @entity2 ’s people and national interests must be the top priority , but all we get from the @entity7 is political posturing			2
’ but a spokesman for the @entity239 said an independent @entity2 would have ‘ first - class conventional forces which will play a full role in defending the country and cooperating with international partners ’			2
‘ @entity2 stands to inherit a fair share of existing @entity6 defence assets , and an annual defence and security budget of £ 2.5billion would represent an increase of more than £ 500million on recent @entity6 levels of defence spending in @entity2 , ’ he said			2
‘ we have also been clear that we will retain all current defence bases , including @entity172 - which will be @entity2 ’s main conventional naval facility – and our long - term commitment will ensure continued support for jobs and local economies in all the communities around @entity2 that are home to military bases			1

*damning* report reveals *reluctance* of soldiers to join @entity4 's army
officers dismiss @entity*26*7 as ' too dead - end and parochial '
troops would rather stay in @entity6 forces so they can see action
the @entity7 ’s defence strategy is not *geared* towards defending @entity2 , but is designed ‘ to help it win the independence referendum ’ .
a separate @entity2 would have an ‘ @entity277 ’ military , when a greater focus on maritime and air defence ‘ would be preferable ’ .
defence firms that employ thousands of @entity2 could be forced to relocate to @entity283 to access the world ’s second - largest defence market .
orders for the @entity6 ’s type *26* global combat ship would ‘ almost certainly ’ be lost , and – in time – ‘ most ’ of @entity2 ’s shipyards would close .
@entity7 plans to base @entity2 ’s navy on the @entity173 raise ‘ *legitimate* questions ’ , given that oil and gas rigs are located almost entirely in the north and east .
