a sure sign of middle age is when you start to get nostalgic about the mobile phones of your youth			0
ok , those early models could n’t do much compared with today ’s smartphones			2
they could n’t surf the internet , take pictures , play music or make you a cup of tea			0
but what they did have was a battery that lasted more than a few hours before the phone went dead			1
there ’s even a word for it — ‘ nomophobia ’ , the fear of being without a working mobile my favourite phone of all time was a sleek silver @entity32 from the early 2000s , which is still sitting in a drawer at home			2
it may be primitive by today ’s standards , but it could run for 17 days on a single charge			0
compare that with the battery life of a modern @entity41 or @entity42			1
make a few calls , send a few emails , listen to some music and you ’ll be out of juice by teatime			0
this week it was revealed that sir @entity50 , inventor of @entity51 hoovers , is attempting to solve the problem by investing £ 10 million in @entity54 - based battery experts @entity55			1
the 67 - year - old entrepreneur is supporting the company as it attempts to double the battery life of our phones , electric cars and vacuums			1
separately , scientists at @entity64 are hoping that their newly invented aluminium battery will revolutionise the industry with its ability to fully charge in under a minute			2
the battery will keep going for seven times as long as its lithium - ion relative , and can apparently withstand 7,500 recharges , whereas a conventional battery can take only 1,000			2
in the tech world , the battle for better battery life is never - ending			1
earlier this month , @entity76 was left red - faced when it was revealed how quickly its new @entity78 — which costs up to £ 12,000 — ran out of power			0
sir @entity50 , pictured , inventor of @entity51 hoovers , is attempting to solve the problem by investing £ 10 million in battery experts @entity82 at the launch , @entity76 chief executive @entity83 boasted that the device had a battery life of 18 hours			1
but it later emerged that using the smartwatch for phone calls or apps means it will die after three hours			1
according to a recent poll , nine out of ten people feel stressed if their phone battery run out			1
there ’s even a word for it — ‘ nomophobia ’ , the fear of being without a working mobile			0
and increasingly , phones come with built - in batteries that are almost impossible to remove without a degree in electronics			2
@entity76 started the ball rolling with the @entity41 , and this month @entity42 announced its latest model — the @entity107 — would have built - in batteries			2
so is there anything we can do to get more juice out of our phones ? @entity114 , professor of telecommunications at @entity116 , says the problem is n’t the batteries , which have improved immeasurably over the past couple of decades			1
‘ the reason why batteries lasted seven days in the 1990s is that a phone back then did n’t do a great deal , ’ says professor @entity114			1
‘ it had a monochrome screen , made phone calls and sent the occasional text			2
it did n’t have apps , gps , @entity131 or wi - fi and it was n’t used for @entity132			1
‘ if you take a modern phone and turn off all those things and just use it for phone calls and text messages , it will last a lot longer			1
’ the first mobile phone batteries were bulky , heavy and made with nickel cadium			1
they also lost battery life over time if they were not run down fully between charges , known as the ‘ memory effect ’			1
in the 1990s those early batteries were replaced by a superior version — nickel metal hydride			2
these did n’t suffer as badly from the memory effect , were thinner and quicker to charge			0
today ’s phones use lithium - ion batteries , an even thinner , lighter and even longer - lasting variety			2
how long they last depends what you do with them			0
caught out : early mobile models could n't surf the internet , take pictures , play music or make you a cup of tea			1
but what they did have was a battery that lasted more than a few hours before the phone went dead ‘ one of the big drains is the screen — if people have the brightness turned up , it will run down the battery , ’ says professor @entity114			1
‘ the other drain is the phone signal			2
’ if you are in a low signal area , your battery will drain more quickly because the phone has to work harder to stay in contact with the nearest phone mast			1
phones also use up more of the battery if they are indoors , where signals are weaker			2
but @entity187 , from @entity188 , says there are simple things everyone can do to extend their phone ’s life between charges			1
turning off @entity131 — the wireless system used by phones to connect to printers , laptops and other computers — will save your battery from running down			1
switching off location services which use the phone ’s built - in gps tracker can also save power , as can turning down the volume of the ring tone and silencing any bleeps and clicks when you press buttons on the phone			1
‘ and make sure you have turned off any apps that are running in the background , ’ she says			0
keeping phones cool is also crucial : they work best below 30c ( 86f )			0
so leaving them in the sun , or sleeping with the phone so it gets warm , will run it down faster			2
however , unlike the older style batteries , you do n’t need to discharge modern ones fully before you top them up			1
charging overnight should n’t cause problems , as modern phones and batteries have switches that stop the charging when they are full			1
another way to get more out of a battery is to download the latest version of the phone ’s operating system			1
newer versions of the software used for @entity236 , for instance , let owners stop apps from constantly updating themselves with new information when they are not being used			0
even then , you ’ll still find major variations between different phones			0
that ’s because some models are more efficient at making calls , surfing the internet or playing videos than others			0
when technology consumer website @entity250 tested the battery life of different smartphones , it found that the best lasted an amazing 14 hours longer than the worst			1
the @entity254 kept playing a movie on a loop for more than 20 hours on one charge before it went dead — while the @entity258 managed just six hours and the @entity41 lasted just under 13 hours			0
@entity76 was left red - faced when it was revealed how quickly its new @entity78 ( pictured ) ran out of power			0
it emerged that using the smartwatch for phone calls or apps means it will die after three hours other tests have found that the @entity265 lasts on average 48 hours when used for five hours a day to stream music , make calls and watch videos			1
you may still need to replace a battery ; a typical one will start to lose its ability to recharge after three or four years			0
but replacing batteries is becoming more and more difficult			0
manufacturers are increasingly building batteries into phones so that owners ca n’t remove them			0
you can send your @entity41 off to @entity76 to get the battery replaced , though it will take a week and cost £ 59 plus postage			0
and it is possible to do it yourself with a screwdriver and a replacement @entity41 battery — available for around £ 15 on @entity284			0
but it ’s fairly tricky to pull off and easy to damage the phone			0
some mobile repair shops will also replace batteries — and charge a lot less than @entity76			0
the bright spot on the horizon is that it will soon take less time to charge up a phone			0
‘ almost every manufacturer is bringing in faster charging , so with 15 minutes of charging you get four hours of talk time , ’ says @entity187			0
sales of portable chargers are also booming			0
these slim boxes have to be charged in advance but are small enough to fit in a pocket			0
if your phone is running low , the charger tops up the battery			2
but until battery life catches up with the demands of modern phones , millions of mobile users will spend their life plugging in their phone to charge .			1

most modern phone models have batteries that only last a couple of hours
problem is n't batteries , but amount of tasks mobiles are *expected* to do
battery life can be improved by turning off @entity131 , sounds and gps
