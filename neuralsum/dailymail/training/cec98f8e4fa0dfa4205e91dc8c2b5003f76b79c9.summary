@entity2 says he wants to ‘ improve the area ’s image by getting rid of its negative name ’			1
but the bizarre idea has been dismissed by local residents proud of the fact that @entity11 ’s name was recorded in the @entity21			2
the @entity23 council leader is calling for a public consultation to change the name because it ‘ sounds like the haves and the have nots ’			1
mr @entity2 , who has been the borough leader for five years , said : ‘ i think it ’s unfortunate what the word @entity11 portrays			1
it sounds like have not			2
we live in a part of the country which has the coast and the @entity38 and it ’s a wonderful place			0
‘ i think a name such as @entity41 has a much better ring to it than @entity11			0
‘ the name is very negative but unfortunately people do get attached to place names			0
‘ there are many places in our borough , not just the town @entity11 , and as we share services with other councils i think , to move forward , we should change the name			0
‘ it is confusing to people			0
when i go abroad and i ’m asked where i come from , i tell them and they have no idea where it is			0
’ mr @entity2 added the council could hold a competition to choose a new name			1
but @entity61 , chairman of the @entity62 said : ‘ i ’ve never heard of anything so ridiculous and this just shows how out of touch politicians are with the residents they are supposed to represent			1
‘ there will be a lot of opposition			0
@entity71 here are proud and there is no way they would stand to lose such an important part of their heritage			1
’ the borough of @entity11 has had its name since 1086 and locals say it is ' ridiculous ' to suggest it should change the @entity41 borough – between @entity83 and @entity84 on the @entity85 – derived its name from the village of @entity11 , which had a population of about 100 in 1086 , when the @entity21 was written			1
the village was known as @entity89 around 935 ad , which translates as the spring of man , named after springs in the area			0
@entity94 , director of @entity11 ’s the @entity97 arts and heritage centre , said : ‘ the history and name of @entity11 are very important to the area			1
it comes from the local springs , which were fundamental to the village			0
‘ the water was used to make parchment which , legend has it , was used for the @entity106 and @entity107			0
‘ i do n’t agree the name has a negative connotation and i do n’t think locals have a problem with it either			2
‘ we would welcome a visit from councillors to the heritage centre to learn exactly how the borough got its name and how important it is			2

council leader @entity2 says historic name is ' unfortunate '
locals have *branded* plans as ' ridiculous ' and want to hold on to heritage
