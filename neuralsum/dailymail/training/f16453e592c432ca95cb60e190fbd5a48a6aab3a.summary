wavering @entity1 voters were told last night that work towards a ‘ @entity3 ’ would begin the day after next week ’s referendum if they back a no vote			1
in a desperate bid to halt the momentum of the campaign for independence , @entity6 announced a rapid timetable to give the @entity1 parliament greater control over finance , welfare and taxation			1
such a bill , which could give @entity1 the power to raise income tax to pay for more spending , will be outlined within six weeks of the vote			1

incredibly , the move leaves the fate of @entity47 – likely to face calls to quit if he presides over the end of the 300 - year - old @entity44 – depending on the success or failure of mr @entity6 , his opponent at the 2010 general election			0
throughout the campaign , polls have shown that if given the choice more @entity1 would pick the option of a stronger @entity1 parliament over independence or the current arrangement			2
but mr @entity47 favoured a straight yes / no choice on independence , rather than putting a ‘ devo - max ’ option on the referendum ballot paper			2
@entity66 last night welcomed mr @entity6 ’s timetable and all three @entity69 parties are expected to formally back the proposals this week			0
the @entity72 campaign said mr @entity6 ’s last - ditch intervention ‘ smacked of utter panic and desperation ’ but , despite his attempt to present the plans as something that has already been decided , there are deep splits in @entity38 over whether or not to enhance its existing offer to hand more powers to @entity1			1
at a miners ’ welfare club in @entity27 , @entity28 , mr @entity6 said : ‘ the alternative to an irreversible separation is a more powerful @entity1 parliament with a timetable for its delivery			1
‘ @entity1 voters deserve to know to the fullest extent possible about how new powers as ambitious as possible will be delivered as soon as possible within the @entity94			1
so , we are demanding a tight timetable with tough deadlines and streamlined procedures			0
‘ a no vote on september 18 will not be an end point but the starting gun for action on september 19 , when straight away we will kick off a plan to deliver the enhanced devolution that we want			0
on september 19 we will start bringing into law the new , stronger @entity1 parliament , and to secure the change we want we will work with the other parties			2
’ mr @entity6 said a document outlining the plans and issues that need to be resolved would be published by the end of october , with a @entity113 drawn up by november 30 , @entity114			0

mr @entity6 said the proposed new powers including the ability to change income tax ‘ would be the biggest transfer of fiscal power in the history of the @entity94 ’			1
he added : ‘ my judgment is that these are the powers people want			0
a stronger @entity1 parliament within the @entity94 , without breaking the link on pensions , funding , health care , jobs , the currency and defence			2
’ the three @entity69 parties have each put forward separate plans for devolving more powers , but a @entity66 source said they overlap to a substantial degree			2
the @entity1 conservatives want @entity150 to be given full income tax powers and responsibility on welfare issues related to devolved areas , such as housing benefits			1
in its proposals , @entity38 ’s devolution commission said the @entity1 parliament should be able to vary tax by up to 15p in the pound , giving it the option of restoring the 50p rate for top earners			1
the @entity165 want @entity1 to be able to raise and spend most of its own taxes and borrow on its own terms			2
the @entity72 campaign said mr @entity6 ’s last - ditch intervention ‘ smacked of utter panic and desperation ’			0
former @entity175 manager sir @entity174 , who is a @entity176 stalwart , but has largely been absent from the @entity41 campaign he is a @entity176 stalwart and supporter of the campaign against independence , but sir @entity174 ’s absence from the effort to keep @entity1 in the @entity94 over recent months has been noticeable			0
the former @entity175 manager came out in support of the @entity41 campaign two years ago soon after its launch , but has not spoken out recently			0
earlier this year , @entity47 suggested that sir @entity174 should be used in advertisements to boost the anti-independence cause			0
the football manager ’s roots in the shipbuilding community of @entity193 could help win over @entity1 from the most deprived areas , who polls suggest are open to voting ‘ yes ’			1
sir @entity174 previously criticised @entity197 for trying to ‘ silence ’ @entity1 living outside @entity1 over independence			1
‘ no one should question my scottishness just because i live south of the border , ’ he said .			0
