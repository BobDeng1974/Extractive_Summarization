by @entity0 trail blazer : @entity2 , pictured in @entity3 , is stepping up his campaign for wool in one of his most controversial campaigns since he championed organic food before it was fashionable , prince @entity2 will set fire to duvets , jackets and carpets in his back garden – to highlight the value of wool			1
the prince is to conduct the experiment at @entity17 this week to show that the natural fabric is much safer in a blaze than synthetic fibres like acrylic , nylon and polyester			1
it is part of a drive by @entity2 to revive @entity27 ’s love affair with wool , which he sees as a chic , eco-friendly and long - lasting alternative to cheap ‘ throwaway ’ garments			1
@entity2 has been alarmed by the number of sheep farmers committing suicide – their livelihoods dwindled during the foot and mouth crisis			2
he is concerned that synthetic materials are jeopardising wool sales and that unsafe products , some from factories abroad using cheap child labour , appear in shops			2
falling prices meant farmers were paying more to have their sheep sheared than they got for the fleece – but the @entity2 ’s efforts are already turning their fortunes around			2
the @entity2 ’s experiment aims to stress wool ’s natural fire retardant quality			1
while man - made fibres can go up in flames if a cigarette is dropped on them , wool will smoulder and burn out			2
@entity58 said it fully supported the @entity2 ’s initiative , pointing out that at least eight people died last year after their clothes or bedding caught fire			1
however , critics of the campaign say woollen clothes are much more expensive than mass - produced synthetic fabric , and out of the reach of ordinary , cash - strapped families			0
the @entity2 ’s demonstration is to take place on a fire - proof metal stage at his @entity74 home on thursday			1
he will use a flaming taper to set light to a wool jacket and then a synthetic one			0
there will be similar tests on carpets , one wool and the other synthetic which is expected to flare up alarmingly			0
a duvet stuffed with wool and one with a man - made filling will be set alight to illustrate the dangers of smoking in bed			0
later , to prove that wool is also kinder to the environment , the @entity2 , wielding a ceremonial spade once used by @entity91 , will bury a woollen jersey in a flower bed , alongside one made of synthetic material			1
after four months the items will be dug up to reveal the wool version rotting into the soil while the synthetic one will be largely intact			0
flocks : the prince keeps @entity102 ewes , pictured , at @entity103 his aim is to encourage the use of wool as a first choice , especially in public buildings , with woollen blankets in hospitals and carpets in schools			0
he also hopes to see more wool used as insulation			0
one courtier explained : ‘ he is convinced that wool must become an affordable alternative and will lead the argument – however unfashionable and against economic trends – for a better use of our natural resources using a better product and hopefully saving an entire agricultural community			0
’ as part of the international @entity126 , of which he is the patron , the @entity2 has enlisted fashion designer @entity128 and @entity130 stores such as @entity131 and @entity132 – who will be there to witness the plastic pyre			1
five years after the campaign launched , it has seen significant successes			0
the long - term decline in the number of sheep in @entity27 has been reversed – there are well over a million more now than in 2010 – and prices have more than tripled			2
the prince , who keeps a flock of @entity147 sheep at his home at @entity103 in @entity149 , said : ‘ in the past five years , my @entity150 , which aims to increase the demand for this remarkable fibre and assist the sheep farming community , has expanded into 19 countries			0
‘ i am so pleased that it has enjoyed some level of success			0
wool has significant fire - resistant and fire - retardant qualities , and it is so important that manufacturers and consumers alike understand its sustainable and eco-efficient benefits			1
‘ when the campaign launched in 2008 the average price of the wool clip in @entity27 had fallen to 33p per kilo ; it is currently above £ 1 per kilo			1
‘ while wool itself is still affordable , the impact down the line on farmers and wool - growers , and thus on the @entity27 and global sheep - farming industry , is immense			1
‘ if the farmers receive a little more for their wool , they are perhaps enabled to remain doing what they do so well , as opposed to being driven away from the sector because of harsh economic realities			0

@entity2 will conduct an ' experiment ' at @entity17 in @entity74 this week
he aims to show wool is much more fire resistant than synthetics like nylon
