schools in @entity11 believe some people as old as 21 have lied about their ages , prompting concern over the safety of children in schools			2
one headteacher , @entity1 , fears in some cases asylum seekers are placed in mainstream education ' within days ' without the necessary information			1
he said he and other colleagues in @entity11 believe people had presented themselves as under 16 ' only to find that they were clearly 20 or 21 '			0
the county is considered the frontline of the arrival of immigrants into the @entity31 because so many come through the @entity32			0
@entity33 currently has 38 unaccompanied asylum seeker children aged between five and 16 in their schools			1
asylum seekers may be tempted to reduce their age to secure preferential treatment , especially to get an education or improve their chances of staying in the @entity31			1
they may also get better housing with foster carers rather than in shared accommodation with other adults			0
@entity1 , headteacher at @entity47 's @entity46 in @entity2 , said immigrant children - who arrive without parents - were being placed in schools in a ' random and haphazard ' way with few checks on their backgrounds or ages			1
mr @entity1 said : ' while we have great sympathy with those unaccompanied asylum seekers who arrive in @entity59 in need of education and support , this does present a difficult position for schools			1
' we are being asked to admit pupils to our schools with very little information about him ( sic )			1
' sometimes there is doubt about where they come from , and what age they are			1
' mr @entity1 said the majority come from or claim to come from war - torn countries in the @entity77 such as @entity78 and @entity79 , or from @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84			1
vigilance : the head at @entity47 's @entity46 in @entity2 , pictured , said children are being placed in schools in a ' random and haphazard ' way he said : ' while i recognise that there is a very difficult balance to strike here , this lack of information and uncertainty could be seen as a safeguarding issue for schools			1
' quite rightly , schools are held to the very highest standards when it comes to keeping children safe			2
' i believe that there have to be serious questions asked in some cases about the wisdom of immediately placing these children into mainstream educational settings			0
' meanwhile , @entity111 secondary school , in @entity109 , near @entity2 , has had two unaccompanied asylum seeking children placed in it this term			1
headteacher @entity116 said : ' while many of these are genuine cases and we will do all that we can to support these young people , a minority are not			1
' as a school we have to be increasingly vigilant , given the lack of information that is provided			0
safeguarding our pupils is paramount			2
' @entity33 , the local education authority , insisted today it assesses unaccompanied asylum seekers ' rigorously ' before finding them school places			1
but admitted ' in very rare cases where asylum seeking children have been found to be older than the age they claimed '			1
a spokesman said : ' asylum seeking children are treated the same as other children in care			2
' they are vulnerable young people who have often had a very difficult and traumatic journey to arrive in the @entity31			2
' when they arrive in @entity11 , they are rigorously assessed by skilled social workers and educational assessors who are experienced in making an informed judgement about their age			1
' in many cases , due to the lack of records or disruption in their home country , there is no way to check this information			0
' like any other child in care , schools are allocated on the basis of where they live			2
' if the young person can not speak @entity162 , it is the responsibility of the school to provide the appropriate support , as it would with any student			0
@entity166 , right , claimed the taxpayer should fund his £ 10,000 flying lessons after his family abandoned him as a child			0
but last year the @entity171 revealed he may have lied about his age to milk the public purse for tens of thousands of pounds			0
the failed asylum seeker pretended to be 15 years old so that he could be cared for as a destitute child – while in reality he was a grown man of almost 20			2
he also claimed his mother was missing and his father either dead or in prison , but the @entity171 ’s inquiries reveal that he is still in touch with his family			0
his lies mean he has wrongly received two years of accommodation , living expenses and schooling paid for by @entity186			0
and because he was a so - called ‘ looked - after child ’ , it has meant the authority has been forced to pay for his flying lessons , even though he turned 26			0
@entity186 was forced to pay £ 10,000 for mr @entity166 to train as a pilot after it lost a case in the @entity194 earlier last year			0
' in very rare cases where asylum seeking children have been found to be older than the age they claimed , action has immediately been taken to remove them from school and to inform police and the @entity204			2
' in such cases , there is no evidence to suggest other pupils have been placed at risk			0
' @entity211 headteacher @entity210 urged a cautious approach to the issue of asylum seeking children			2
he said : ' a very small number of unaccompanied asylum seekers may be older than stated or provide limited background information			1
' this will cause difficulty			0
staff will follow safeguarding procedures			0
' last year 130 unaccompanied children arrived in @entity11 with most found in the back of lorries			0
younger children are placed with foster carers while those judged to be at least 15 or 16 are placed in a converted old people 's home in @entity11			0
@entity230 , former headteacher of @entity231 in @entity2 , believes it is tempting for asylum seekers to claim they are younger than they are to secure preferential treatment			1
mr @entity230 is now chairman of the @entity235 , a body which meets to ensure that children who find themselves out of school are given places			0
