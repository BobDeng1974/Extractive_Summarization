@entity1 midfielder @entity0 is no closer to committing his own future to @entity3 despite the new deals given to @entity5 and @entity6			1
@entity5 extended his contract until 2019 with @entity6 committing until 2018 last week , but @entity0 , who has been linked with a move to @entity9 , where former @entity3 coach @entity10 takes charge next month , is still far from agreeing new terms			1
@entity0 has already turned down @entity3 's first offer and suggested more acceptable terms , but the record @entity16 champions have yet to reach a compromise with the 24 - year - old			1
' with respect to the time before the @entity31 , nothing at all has changed			0
' if anything does happen , then you will all find out			0
congratulations to @entity6 and @entity5 for their decisions and extensions			2
' @entity0 is still tied to @entity3 until 2015 , but should no new agreement be reached there may be a temptation to sell the former @entity41 midfielder this summer rather than potentially lose him on a free transfer next year			1
wanted : @entity0 is wanted by a number of top clubs , including @entity9 incoming : new @entity9 manager @entity10 saw his @entity46 team beat @entity47 in @entity48 in the meantime , @entity0 is focusing on helping @entity1 win their first @entity31 since @entity1 's 1990 triumph , saying euphoria is unlikely to distract them after the 4 - 0 win over @entity55 on monday			2
they face @entity57 next , in @entity58 on saturday			0
' we do n't need bringing back down to earth because we 've only won one game and that 's nothing compared to what we have planned , ' @entity0 said			0
' our opening game is already history ; it does n't count anymore it 's great that we 've made people euphoric , but that euphoria certainly is n't going to get to us			0

@entity0 yet to agree a new deal with @entity3
@entity6 and @entity5 signed new contracts with @entity16 club
