by @entity0 published : 11:12 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 02:51 est , 26 february 2013 a building with an invisible ' wall of death ' has been blamed for the deaths of dozens of migrating geese who flew straight into it after mistaking it for the sky			1
the pale grey - coloured wall on the end of @entity12 development in the seaside town of @entity14 , @entity15 , stands directly in the birds ' flight path to the @entity18			1
the colour of the paint means many @entity22 geese have flown into the wall , breaking their necks and falling to the ground			1
the wall is now peppered with indentations made by the birds ' beaks			2
blending in : the side wall of a seaside block of flats in @entity14 , @entity15 , has been painted to blend in with its surroundings but is causing the deaths of numerous geese which are mistaking it for the sky birds have apparently struggled with the building since it was built in 2008 and developers have put up @entity42 lighting to act as a deterrent			1
but residents have claimed the building 's lighting is ineffective and birds are still being killed by flying into the wall			1
dog walker @entity49 , who spotted a lifeless bird at the foot of the wall last month , said : ' my husband and i saw it and thought what a shame as it was such a big , beautiful bird			2
' we walk the dogs every day in that area and over the years we have seen quite a few that have ended up dead as a result of flying into the building			2
impact : the wall of the apartment building shows deep impact marks from where geese have flown in to it changing the skyline : an artist 's impression of what a woodland mural would look like on the apartment wall as councillors attempt to use artwork to prevent more bird deaths ' the morning we were there , the sky and the wall were more or less the same colour and i think that 's what gets them			1
all it needs is something hanging over it to distract them , like a long flag			0
' there are lights at the top of the building but they are no good in the early morning or dusk			0
i just think if it 's happening again how many more are going to fly into it ? something needs to be done			0
' councillors have now voted to instigate the idea of drawing murals on the wall			2
local artist @entity105 believes the cream facade could be transformed into public art. he said : ' i love nature and wildlife and have painted in the fields and the moors for years			0
unnecessary deaths : local @entity113 with two of the geese who died after flying into the side of the @entity119 block of flats in @entity14 ' it 's such a shame that so many birds are being destroyed by hitting a brick wall , which can be easily rectified by a few colours			1
' it is crying out for a piece of art. i always think it looks like a big solid canvass			0
perhaps it could be a project for young art students			0
young people would have some brilliant ideas			0
' @entity14 wildlife rescuer @entity135 said : ' my suggestion would be that with @entity22 geese being a bird that lives in estuaries and lakelands , i would paint a woodland scene on the side of the wall			1
the geese steer clear of those environments because they are too big and cumbersome			0
' escape 2 @entity119 , which manages the Â£ 190,000 apartments , has previously said it was investigating a number of possible solutions to eliminate future incidents .			0

@entity152 of building in @entity14 , @entity15 , painted a very light grey

councillors are trying to get the wall *covered* in art to prevent more deaths
