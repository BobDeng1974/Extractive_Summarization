it is the moment mother @entity1 feared she would never experience – the ‘ lion ’s roar ’ of her baby ’s vital first cry			1
after she had lost two babies because they were born prematurely , doctors went to extraordinary lengths to ensure baby @entity8 would survive			1
one year earlier , she had delivered her tiny daughter @entity9 at 24 weeks , a baby who tragically lived for just one hour			1
despite her overwhelming grief , mrs @entity1 allowed a photograph showing @entity9 struggling for life to be published , because she felt so strongly that abortions should not be carried out on babies of a similar age			1
other babies born so prematurely have survived , which she believed made ‘ a mockery ’ of the law allowing abortions until the start of the 24th week of pregnancy			1
before 24 weeks , they are not legally considered ‘ viable ’ – despite recent advances in neonatal care			1
the tragedy : this was the image that broke our hearts ... of baby girl @entity9 who died at 24 weeks the triumph : this is baby boy @entity8 , born to the same mother ... who lived at 32 weeks doctors had told mrs @entity1 that , due to physiological reasons , any child she conceived was unlikely to survive			1
her cervix was so short that it would be a miracle if her womb could hold on to the baby long enough – meaning it would probably die after another extremely premature birth			1
but now mrs @entity1 , 26 , has realised her ‘ impossible ’ dream of becoming a mother , giving birth to @entity8 at 32 weeks last december , with her husband @entity47 beside her			1
@entity8 ’s birth came not only after the heartache of losing @entity9 , but also their first baby @entity50 , who was born at 23 weeks in 2011			1
but thanks to medics at @entity54 in @entity55 , the result this time has been triumph instead of tragedy			0
describing the moment @entity8 erupted into life , mrs @entity1 said : ‘ @entity50 never cried and @entity9 ’s cry was very weak but @entity8 ’s was like a lion ’s roar			1
‘ we just burst into tears because we finally believed he really was going to be ok			0
’ thriving : @entity8 with mother @entity1 , who now feels ' totally blessed ' she said : ‘ there were so many times when i thought , “ i ’m never going to be a mum , ever			1
it ’s not meant to be			0
” ‘ after @entity50 and @entity9 , we asked ourselves , “ are we going to put ourselves through this again ? are we going to put ourselves through potentially another loss ? ” ‘ but we just had to give it another go			0
i just could n’t give up			0
’ mrs @entity1 and @entity47 , a 29 - year - old security guard , subsequently started @entity74 in march and she was implanted with the embryo in april			1
hero : professor @entity77 holds tiny @entity8 shortly after his birth crucially , her obstetrician professor @entity77 used medical techniques designed to ‘ trick ’ her body into avoiding an early labour			1
at 12 weeks , he put in a cervical stitch to give her womb more support			2
and at 14 weeks , he started giving her extra doses of progesterone			2
explaining why he administered extra progesterone , he said : ‘ progesterone is hugely higher in pregnancy than at other times			0
this helps to keep the uterus muscle quiet and probably helps reduce inflammation too , so there ’s nothing driving it to contract before it should			0
‘ but we think some women do n’t have enough progesterone in pregnancy , so the uterine muscle sparks off			0
we know that if we give this medication , it reduces the chance of early labour by about 50 per cent			2
’ other precautions included prescribing aspirin to help maintain a healthy placenta , as doctors believe a breakdown triggered her miscarriage of @entity50 , and regular screening			2
and in a highly unusual move , mrs @entity1 also spent over a month in hospital when she reached 23 weeks , so medical staff could do everything possible to stop the baby arriving early			1
nurses scanned her every 48 hours to monitor the baby and – crucially – measure if her cervix was shortening			2
if it was , that drastically increased the risk of contractions starting			0
thankfully , she did not go into labour – and a week after being discharged , she enjoyed a baby shower party with friends at home in @entity134 , @entity135			2
she said : ‘ it was a huge milestone because i ’d lost both my daughters before my baby showers			2
’ but soon afterwards , her waters began to leak , raising the risk that @entity8 could contract a potentially fatal infection			2
as a result , prof @entity77 and colleagues decided it would be safer to get the baby out rather than continue to 36 weeks , which had been the target delivery date			2
before the birth , mrs @entity1 was injected with steroids to boost @entity8 ’s lungs to help him breathe independently after birth , which had been a major concern			1
it paid off too and he needed no help breathing from his first breathe			0
mr and mrs @entity1 married on september 8th 2012 in a villa in @entity157			1
this day was the anniversary of mrs @entity1 ' first daughter @entity159 's birth and death five days after the birth , @entity8 was transferred from @entity54 ’s specialist neonatal department to @entity164 , and he was discharged at three weeks			1
but his mother admitted : ‘ even now , i feel like @entity8 is on loan because it feels too good to be true , that he is actually here			1
he is now 9lb 1oz , though , and doing great			0
he ’s got some catching up to do , but he ’s even started smiling			0
’ she added : ‘ i tried to thank the professor but there were n’t really the words to convey what he has done for us			0
’ prof @entity77 said he was ‘ no cleverer than anyone else ’ , but had the good fortune to work at @entity54 , which has one of the safest maternity units in the country			0
looking back on her two earlier births , mrs @entity1 said she could not understand how @entity50 could have been legally aborted			1
‘ @entity50 was born at 23 weeks and called a miscarriage , and @entity9 was born one week later and called a neonatal death – but both my daughters looked exactly the same to me , ’ she said			2
‘ we found the term miscarriage to be offensive			0
but what really hurt was knowing that this country permits babies like @entity9 and @entity50 to be terminated			2
i am not opposed to late abortions on medical grounds – if there is something seriously wrong with the baby , or if the mother ’s life is at risk			1
‘ but personally i believe that if an abortion is for social reasons – just because you ’ve been lazy with contraception – then i ’m 100 per cent sure the 24 - week limit is too high			0
we live in an age where the technology is available to keep a baby alive who is born at 23 or 24 weeks			1
‘ i know only too well we ca n’t keep all of them alive , but we can save some			0
so i think it ’s wrong that babies can be aborted when they reach that stage			0
in my opinion , the limit should be lowered to 16 weeks , because four months is long enough to make up your mind if you want to keep the baby or not			2
‘ a baby is a baby from the moment you see a blue line on the pregnancy test			2
i saw @entity9 and @entity8 when they were embryos , because they were both conceived through @entity74 , and to me they were already babies at that very early stage			1
’ survival rates among babies born in @entity225 at 24 weeks have jumped in recent decades			1
while only 35 per cent of those admitted to neonatal care survived in 1995 , 47 per cent did in 2006 , according to a study published in the @entity229 in 2012			0
but only a quarter of those who survive birth before 24 weeks escape major health problems			1
@entity1 and @entity234 fell in love in the agonising weeks after she lost her first daughter @entity50 more recent research has found higher survival rates among those born in highly specialist units like @entity54			1
and the @entity229 figures are now almost a decade old – meaning there may have been further improvements in survival rates since then			0
at around the time that paper was published , health secretary @entity245 caused consternation by saying he thought the abortion limit should be cut to 12 weeks			0
he let slip in an interview : ‘ everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is , and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it			2
’ his comments caused uproar among ‘ pro-choice ’ campaigners , who labelled him a ‘ hard - line anti-abortionist ’ , but also from doctors			0
they said that there was no evidence for halving the time limit and that many abortions were carried out after 12 weeks for sound medical reasons			0
however , other senior conservatives have also backed lowering the limit , with home secretary @entity273 suggesting 20 weeks , and former culture secretary @entity274 saying it is ‘ common sense ’ because ‘ the science has moved on ’			0
almost 16,000 abortions in @entity225 and @entity278 – nearly a tenth of the annual total – are performed after 12 weeks			0
of those , 2,500 are carried out after 20 weeks but before 24 weeks			1
mrs @entity1 said her newborn son bore such a strong resemblance to @entity9 at birth that she felt he had brought part of her with him			1
‘ my heart will always be broken for @entity9 and @entity50 , but @entity287 has helped me to heal , ’ she said			0
‘ we feel totally blessed now , because we know that there are so many people who will never be in our shoes			0
we know how lucky we are			0
