@entity2 paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks , stroke and early death , a major study has warned @entity2 paracetamol could raise the risk of heart attacks , stroke and early death , a major study warns today			1
it found that patients prescribed high doses of the painkiller for long periods were up to 63 per cent more likely to die unexpectedly			1
the risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed			1
@entity20 is considered by doctors to be safer than aspirin , which can cause stomach bleeds , and ibuprofen , which has been linked to heart attacks and strokes			0
but @entity28 researchers who looked at studies involving 666,000 patients say the risks may have been underestimated and are calling for a major review to be conducted into the drug ’s safety			1
they think paracetamol may be causing illness by preventing the action of an enzyme in the body called @entity40			1
scientists from the @entity42 looked at eight studies that contained information on patients taking paracetamol daily for up to 14 years , for conditions such as arthritis and severe back pain			0
they also covered patients who took the medicine less often or hardly at all			0
@entity52 , who led the research , pointed out that for most patients the risks were very small and those given paracetamol over a long period would have illnesses likely to kill them early			0
for this reason it was difficult to be sure the drugs were causing problems			0
but the professor added : ‘ i am a bit worried that paracetamol at high dose for long periods could be associated with side effects that we had n’t previously associated			1
’ he said patients being prescribed the drugs for long periods for arthritis or muscle and joint pain should talk to their doctor about alternative treatments , such as exercise			2
published in the journal , @entity82 , the study concluded : ‘ given its high usage and availability , a systematic review of paracetamol ’s efficacy and tolerability in individual conditions is warranted			2
’ professor @entity52 said it was not possible from the studies to work out how the average person ’s lifetime risk of a heart attack or stroke would increase if they took paracetamol for a long period			1
the risk of having a heart attack or stroke was up to 68 per cent higher and there was an almost 50 per cent greater chance of having a stomach ulcer or bleed , for those who took the drug for longer periods statistically , one in six men and one in ten women will die from heart attacks , strokes and other complications of heart disease			1
other scientists played down the risks			0
professor @entity116 , who specialises in clinical toxicology at the @entity118 , said : ‘ based on this study the risk is minimal			2
@entity20 remains the safest analgesic available , and this study should not stop people taking it			2
‘ based on these results , the lowest effective dose for the shortest necessary period is advised , this is common sense for all medicines			0
’ @entity20 is the most commonly used painkiller in the @entity28 and 22.5million prescriptions are handed out each year			0
a further 200million packs are sold over the counter			0
although the @entity132 does not keep figures , evidence from @entity135 suggests that 5 per cent of the population are given at least one high dose prescription of paracetamol over the course of a year			0
a 2013 @entity141 study warned that for every 1,000 patients on ibuprofen or a similar drug , three would suffer a heart attack within a year , of which one would be fatal .			1

those taking drug for long periods up to 63 **%** more likely to die suddenly
their risk of a heart attack or a stroke is also up to 68 **%** higher , study warns
@entity28 researchers behind study now calling for major review into drug
they say drug may be causing illness by *inhibiting* enzyme called @entity40
