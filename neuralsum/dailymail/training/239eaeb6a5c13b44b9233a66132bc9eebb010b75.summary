former @entity2 chief @entity1 could have endangered the lives of hundreds of thousands of soldiers for some money and personal gain , a special court observed on saturday while sentencing the 72 - year - old to four years in prison			1
@entity1 , who was caught on tape accepting a bribe from journalists pretending to be arms dealers , was also slapped with a fine of @entity14 , 000			1
' the convict had kept his individual interests over and above the national interest and had even agreed to compromise the security and safety of the nation , ' additional sessions judge @entity15 said			2
@entity2 leader @entity1 ( centre ) outside a @entity25 court , which sent him to prison for four years in a corruption case she added that ' corruption is worse than prostitution as it endangers the whole society '			1
' ( @entity33 ) agreed to compromise with the lives of lakhs of soldiers who , without fearing for their lives , fight for the nation '			2
in 2001 , @entity1 had been caught in a sting operation receiving @entity14 , 000 in bribe from @entity42 journalists who had claimed to be representatives of a fake @entity45 - based arms manufacturing company			1

jailed : @entity1 , former president of the @entity2 the court , while considering what sentence to give @entity1 , was alarmed at the cavalier attitude with which he was ready to exercise his influence over defence contracts			1
' even in the very first meeting with the representatives of a company , ( he ) had agreed to extend his influence for getting a supply order in their favour , with respect to defence - related equipment for his personal gains , without giving it a thought that the equipment of this company may or may not be of standard quality , ' the court said			1
despite ' @entity49 ' being a fictitious company and fake arms dealers , the court said @entity1 's willingness to influence the defence contract in return for illegal gratification was genuine			1
this conclusion led the court to convict the former @entity2 president under section 9 of the @entity82 , which entails a prison sentence ranging from six months to five years			2
though the defence counsel had argued for leniency , saying the 72 - year - old suffers from diabetes and health issues , the @entity84 demanded maximum punishment , saying it would deter others from going down the path of corruption			2
' considering the gravity and the impact which his influence would have had on the lives of the soldiers of @entity53 , had the design of convict materialised , i am of the opinion that there are no mitigating circumstances and he does not deserve the leniency , ' the court said			2
' being president of a political party ( he ) was supposed to have shown exemplary character to lead by example			0
but that was not to be			0
' @entity1 , the septuagenarian former @entity2 chief , now faces four years behind bars at @entity116 — and he will have work since he has been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment			1

party spokesperson @entity144 said in @entity145 : ' the @entity130 should not lecture us on morality			0
