actress ' lawyer @entity0 insists : ' we will go for re-trial ' by @entity4 published : 14:57 est , 19 march 2012 updated : 18:49 est , 19 march 2012 it 's been four years since fans watched @entity7 , the vamp of the @entity9 ' original five , die from electrocution in the aftermath of a dramatic car crash			1
and today , @entity13 - the actress who played the pneumatic blonde - stormed out of court in an equally compelling fashion after discovering she was just a juror away from vindication in her wrongful termination suit brought against her former bosses ... and a $ 6 million payout			1
judge @entity23 declared a mistrial following days of a solidly hung jury , this means that the case will have to be brought to trial again if @entity13 wants to pursue a verdict			1
they were hung 8 - 4 in favour of her version of events : that @entity7 was killed because @entity13 complained about series creator @entity44 's behaviour towards her			1
@entity13 needed just one more juror to be convinced that this is what happened for a victory verdict , and those damages of just under $ 6 million			1
well heeled : @entity13 has donned a couture suit with matching pumps for each day of testimony and deliberation she claimed that he 'd given her a ' wallop ' on the head during a rehearsal for a scene in 2008 , he contended it was a ' tap ' for direction as they worked on her character 's responses			1
it had seemed this argument was terminally wounded when this charge of battery against @entity44 was dismissed early last week			2
he was released as a defendant in the case but the issue of whether @entity71 and @entity44 killed @entity7 off because of the complaint , regardless of the severity of the incident , still remained			2
and the jury almost conclusively agreed with @entity13 's claims , despite @entity44 and @entity71 bosses taking the stand over the past two weeks to insist this exit was months in the planning before this incident and subsequent complaint			2
much of the testimony focused on the timing of @entity44 's decision to kill off @entity7			0
ten witnesses said he made it months before the on - set incident , but two writers for the show said her fate was not sealed until after			0
48 - year - old @entity13 wanted at least $ 5.7 million from creator @entity44 and @entity93			0
the two - week trial offered jurors a behind - the - scenes look at the soap , which is to bow out this spring after eight seasons			0
the testimony of more than a dozen writers , executives and producers was often unflattering			0
there were tales of salary disputes and arguments over forgotten lines			0
@entity13 said @entity44 talked down to her , and he recalled her as rude , unpunctual and unprepared for rehearsals			0
he also recounted her fighting with co-star @entity110 over forgotten lines and said two other stars , @entity112 and @entity113 , were ' relieved ' when they learned she was leaving the show			0
vindicated ... almost : @entity13 , who was smiling hopefully as she arrived at court in @entity116 today with lawyer @entity0 , had eight jurors behind her when a mistrial was recorded , she need one more to win battled it out : @entity13 said @entity44 ( right ) ' walloped ' her but this battery charge was dismissed meaning he was not at court for the last few days the @entity9 cast : @entity122 , @entity112 , @entity123 , @entity113 , @entity110 and @entity13 big draw : viewers loved tuning in to watch @entity7 's antics on @entity9			1
