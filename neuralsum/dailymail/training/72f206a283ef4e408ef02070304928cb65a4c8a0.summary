a young woman woke from a life - threatening seizure to discover she 'd given birth to a 1lb baby			1
@entity4 , 23 , collapsed and suffered a huge fit when she was just 24 weeks pregnant			1
while she lay unconscious , doctors battled to deliver her baby and save both their fragile lives			2
remarkably , mrs @entity4 survived her ordeal , but woke up three days later with no memory of giving birth to the little boy she had carried for six months			1
miss @entity4 , from @entity14 , @entity15 , said : ' i remember waking up and my husband , @entity17 , showing me a picture of a baby on his phone , and explaining it was our son			1
' i could n't believe it - i had no memory of giving birth - it was all so surreal			2
' i felt robbed of the experience of pregnancy as i had n't even felt our baby kick			0
@entity4 , 23 , woke up from a near - fatal seizure and discovered she 'd given birth to her baby son , @entity31			1
the pair are pictured , with @entity31 now s 17 months old mrs @entity4 ( right ) had no idea she 'd had a caesarean section to give birth to @entity31			1
she and husband @entity17 , 24 ( left ) , had been at a car festival when she suffered a seizure and was rushed to hospital @entity31 was born prematurely and weighing just 1lb			1
he was rushed to another hospital for treatment as his lungs had not developed properly			2
he is pictured here at three weeks old , when doctors said he had a one in ten chance of survival			1
he underwent a heart operation and 17 blood transfusions a week later ' @entity17 told me how much our baby weighed , how old he was , that he was very poorly and being treated in a different hospital			1
' i could n't believe what had happened , to know that i 'd missed out on his birth , and that all our relatives had seen him before me was almost too much to bear			0
' giving birth is one of the biggest moments of a women 's life - and i missed it			0
' i just wanted to see him straight away and make sure he was ok			0
' slowly , mrs @entity4 recovered from the near fatal pre-eclampsia that had caused her seizures			1
@entity62 affects five per cent of pregnant women , causing high blood pressure and swelling in the feet , ankles and hands			1
only one to two per cent develop severe complications like the convulsions mrs @entity4 suffered			1
after an agonising seven day wait while she recovered , she finally met her son , @entity31 , now 17 months			2
she said : ' @entity17 led me into a room full of newborn babies and i had to ask which was ours			2
' but as soon as i saw @entity31 i burst into tears - i felt bonded with him immediately			2
' all my energy was focused on him and helping him get better			0
' the ordeal ordeal began when @entity80 and mrs @entity4 attended a car festival in july last year			1
@entity62 affects some pregnant women , usually during the second half of pregnancy ( from around 20 weeks ) it causes high blood pressure and protein in the urine - signs that should be picked up during routine antenatal check - ups			1
occasionally , symptoms can include swelling in the feet , ankles and hands , vision problems headaches and pain just below the ribs			0
although the exact cause of pre-eclampsia is not known , it is thought to occur when there is a problem with the placenta			0
if left untreated it can cause the convulsions that mrs @entity4 experienced			1
although most cases of pre-eclampsia cause no problems and improve soon after the baby is delivered , there is a risk of serious complications that can affect both the mother and baby			2
there is a risk the mother will develop fits called eclampsia			0
these fits can be life threatening for the mother and the baby , but they are rare			0
source : @entity122 ' @entity4 was sitting in the car and she shouted at me because her shoulder was twitching , ' mr @entity123 recalls			0
' it just suddenly escalated and she was having a big fit			0
' i just could n't believe what was happening			0
' she must have bit down on her tongue because it swelled up and she was having trouble breathing			0
' i managed to give her mouth to mouth - the paramedics said that if i had n't been there she might not have even made it to the hospital			0
' after being rushed to hospital , mrs @entity4 began to have her second violent seizure which doctors later discovered was as a result of pre-eclampsia			1
it was then that doctors explained that the only chance of saving her life , was to deliver her baby early			2
mrs @entity4 said : ' i vaguely remember arguing with the doctors because i did n't want them to deliver @entity31 so early			1
' but the doctors told me i was in severe danger - minutes away from death - and i needed to get to theatre			2
' i was then in and out of consciousness for the next three days			0
' i do n't remember giving birth to @entity31 or seeing him at all			2
' i have no memory of what happened			0
' @entity31 was delivered by caesarean section while both his and mrs @entity4 's life hung in the balance			1
mr @entity123 said : ' when @entity31 was born , @entity4 was totally out of it			1
' they told me his chances of survival were really slim , it was just awful			0
' @entity31 was then transferred to a different hospital and i just spent the days going in between the two			2
' it was awful to see @entity4 so ill , knowing that she had a baby that she 'd never ever met			2
' @entity31 not only underwent a heart operation , but 17 blood transfusions and five rounds of laser eye surgery to save his sight			1
doctors said he had a 98 per cent chance of being blind , but parents are thrilled he now has driving standard eyesight			1
he is pictured here recovering at home with his mother @entity31 's parents call him their ' little miracle ' as he survived against the odds and is now healthy			2
mr @entity123 called his wife and his son ' incredible ' over the next few days doctors finally managed to stabilize her , but despite her quick recovery , little @entity31 faced a long battle ahead , with just a one in ten chance of survival			1
mrs @entity4 said : ' @entity31 is really the fighter in all of this			1
' he was born at just 24 weeks and was so premature that his lungs has n't developed properly , so he was battling chronic lung disease			2
' he had to have 17 blood transfusions , and was really struggling to survive			1
' when i first saw him his skin was almost see through and he tubes coming out of him everywhere			0
' he was on a ventilator and had a hat on him - all i could do was stroke him as he had to stay in his incubator			0
' @entity31 then went on a year long journey in order to recover			0
mrs @entity4 said : ' to begin with @entity31 was very ill. ' he had to go to @entity202 for a heart operation when he was just 4 weeks old			1
' then we were told he had a 98 per cent chance of been blind and he underwent five lots of laser eye surgery			1
' @entity17 and i were warned on more than one occasion that he may not make it			0
' but over time he just seemed to get better and better			0
' slowly but surely he began to breathe on his own			0
' when he was six months old , we finally got to take him home and it was the best day ever			0
' his eye sight is now as good as driving standard which is a miracle			0
' he 's gone from strength to strength and about three weeks before his first birthday in july , he finally came off his oxygen for good			0
' mrs @entity4 and @entity17 are now enjoying time at home with their healthy son			1
@entity17 said : ' it 's amazing to think that after everything they 've both through they 're both here to tell the tale			0
' i could have lost them both so i feel lucky to have my family here			0
