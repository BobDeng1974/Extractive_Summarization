by @entity1 reporter @entity2 : 12:38 est , 18 december 2013 @entity3 : 13:34 est , 18 december 2013 disgraced former @entity5 chaplain @entity6 ' @entity4 has weighed in on a recent ruling by a @entity9 court that forced a @entity11 bakery to serve wedding cakes to same - sex couples , slamming the plaintiffs at the center of the lawsuit have ' demonic spirits manifesting inside them ' and are ' cooperating with the devil			1
in his latest anti-gay tirade , @entity19 , who has become infamous for the pro-discrimination statements made on his daily ' @entity22 ' tv program , said @entity24 and @entity25 - who sued their local bakery for refusing to sell them a cake for their nuptials - are ' inhuman '			1
@entity19 also said he is looking into having administrative law judge @entity32 - who made the bakery treat gay people as regular customers - impeached in the wake of the ruling , according to the @entity38			1
' i admit that the two men are humans -- they 're men , ' @entity19 said			0
' he then added : ' they 're cooperating with the devil and there is something unhuman inside of them			1
' an evangelical @entity71 chaplain , @entity4 was involuntarily discharged from the @entity5 and fined $ 3000 in 2007 for wearing his military uniform at a protest in @entity74 that was trying to push the government to guarantee the right of chaplains to ' pray in the name of @entity79 '			1
he is not the first to renounce the @entity11 ruling			2
last week , the @entity82 's @entity81 said @entity84 owner @entity83 was a victim of what he described as ' the @entity86 ' on an installment of his ' @entity89 ' radio show			2
in september judge @entity32 ruled that @entity83 had illegally discriminated against the plaintiffs			2
he ordered @entity83 to accommodate same - sex couples or face fines and other penalties			1
owner : @entity95 maintained in court that his belief in @entity79 preventing him from making cakes for same - sex couples			1
the judge ruled in september he had to make such cakes or face fines and other penalties ongoing : @entity24 and @entity25 said they knew of other gay couples who also had orders refused , not necessarily for wedding occasions ' at first blush , it may seem reasonable that a private business should be able to refuse service to anyone it chooses , ' @entity32 wrote in his 13 - page ruling			1
' this view , however , fails to take into account the cost to society and the hurt caused to persons who are denied service simply because of who they are			0
' @entity9 allows civil unions for same - sex couples , but defines marriage as between one man and one woman			1
@entity24 , 33 , and @entity25 , 28 , were wed in @entity127 , one of 16 @entity130 states that have legalized same - sex marriage , but wanted to have a celebration of their nuptials in @entity9			1
@entity83 refused to bake the cake , saying his @entity137 beliefs prevented him from doing so			1
priorities : in another instance a gay couple had their order refused but when told the order was for a dog , the bakery happily agreed to proceed winners : @entity24 and @entity25 on their wedding day @entity148 , an attorney for @entity84 , said the judge 's order puts @entity83 in an impossible position of going against his @entity137 faith			1
' he ca n't violate his conscience in order to collect a paycheck , ' she said			0
' if @entity83 ca n't make wedding cakes , he ca n't continue to support his family			2
and in order to make wedding cakes , @entity83 must violate his belief system			2
that is a reprehensible choice			0
it is antithetical to everything @entity130 stands for			0
' the @entity165 filed a complaint with the @entity167 , which ruled that @entity83 had violated a state law barring discrimination at public accommodations based on race , gender or sexual orientation			2
@entity32 then upheld the commission 's findings			0
@entity25 said in a statement it was ' offensive and dehumanizing ' when he and @entity24 were denied service at the bakery			0
after venting such frustrations on @entity181 , @entity25 received an outpouring of support from the community , with the story ' catching fire ' in the media			0
' we felt that the best way to honor the support that they had given us was to follow this complaint through , ' he said			0
' no one should fear being turned away from a public business because of who they are , ' he said			0
@entity25 said he and @entity24 were ' ecstatic ' about the decision			0
' to a certain extent , though , i do n't think that this is necessarily a surprise , ' he said			0
the discrimination case of @entity24 and @entity25 ( pictured ) was far from the first legal hurdle same sex couples have had to jump over in @entity9 recent advances on gay rights only underscore @entity9 's difficult past on the issue			1
