¿ a nurse at scandal - hit @entity10 said she mistakenly claimed a patient was sleeping when she was dead because she had n't had a break on a 15 - hour night shift			1
@entity1 told the @entity14 and @entity15 that she made notes saying the elderly patient was asleep at 4am and 6am when she had died at 3am			1
ms @entity1 , the nurse in charge of the ward , said she was overworked because of staffing cutbacks and the night that she made the medical note was , ' the busiest night of all			1
' the experienced nurse told the hearing that she was overworked and her ward was understaffed			1
‘ i could n’t have a break because i ’d have to leave a patient on their own in filth or leave them without having their treatment			2
‘ that night was the busiest night of all , we could n’t cope , ’ she explained			2
‘ the hospital did n’t give us the level of care we needed - there would be the same number of staff on a ward where there were just elderly people as there were on our ward which was a gastroenterology ward			1
‘ i sometimes would n’t have a break in a 15 - hour shift because we did n’t have the staff - maybe me , an agency nurse and two carers and that was it			2
’ along with colleague @entity54 , ms @entity1 allegedly failed to provide ' basic life support ' when the nurses discovered the 81 - year - old was unresponsive			1
the @entity58 heard that there was confusion over whether there was a ' do not resuscitate ' order in place for the patient			0
as the pensioner 's life drained away the nurses did not start chest compressions or summon the hospital 's resuscitation team			1
on the afternoon of april 16 , 2010 , registrar dr @entity70 began considering whether or not to impose a ' @entity72 ' order , in light of the patient 's chances of survival if she arrested			0
the woman , referred to as @entity78 , was on dialysis and had been admitted to @entity80 at the hospital at the day before suffering from shortness of breath			0
dr @entity84 decided she wanted to see the woman first , but before she could review @entity78 , @entity86 , acting hospital site manager , received a call stating she had died			0
at the time we just had to cut corners to give patients the right care - my priority is providing patient care			1
’ ms @entity1 said she ignored hospital policy on note - taking , choosing to fill out patients ’ notes at her station rather than at their bedside because she ‘ wanted to make them comfortable ’ and not ‘ disturb ’ them			1
the elderly patient was also not given a diuretic to aid her kidney problems and when her oxygen saturation levels dropped no further checks were made			2
registrar dr @entity70 told the hearing @entity1 and @entity108 acted in the patient ’s best interests			1
the nurses allegedly failed to provide ' basic life support ' when the nurses discovered the 81 - year - old was unresponsive ‘ it really did seem that this lady was dying and that there was nothing that could be done to prevent that , ’ she said			1
‘ i think the nurses acted in the patient ’s best interests			2
‘ @entity10 policy should always be in the patient ’s best interests but it can sometimes be frustrating			0
’ dr @entity84 added that @entity78 was too weak and frail to be resuscitated and that @entity1 and @entity108 had allowed her a ‘ quiet death with dignity ’			2
‘ if @entity78 arrested she was very unlikely to survive and she would n’t have been on ventilation			0
‘ her chances of survival were low			0
‘ i think it was a common sense decision not to resuscitate her because she was elderly and frail			0
‘ technically it was not the right call but it allowed a quiet death with dignity			0
‘ i felt the nurses were experienced and realised the lady was dying so they did n’t put out the call to the resuscitation team but instead contacted the site manager			0
' ms @entity141 told the panel that the expected procedure would have been for @entity1 to press the emergency alarm and commence chest compressions until the resuscitation team arrived			2
@entity146 , a nurse who was working that night , allegedly went for a break at 3am and around 15 minutes later @entity108 went to her and told her that @entity78 had died , the hearing was told			1
' she commented to ms @entity54 that the patient was for twos , which meant that the patient was for resuscitation , ' said ms @entity141			0
she added that this was a reference to extension ' 222 ' , which was the number for the resuscitation team			0
ms @entity141 said : ' ms @entity54 repeated that the patient had already died			2
' ms @entity146 will state that she was shocked by this and informed the nurses that the call should have been put out if there was no @entity72 order in place			0
' @entity1 , who knew @entity78 had already died , subsequently made two entries in woman 's medical notes stating she was asleep at 4am and 6am			1
the nurse admits this , claiming that she was simply confused at the time of making the entries			0
she and @entity108 deny all other allegations against them including making inadequate medical notes and failing to provide basic life support when they found the pensioner unresponsive			1
@entity10 was the subject of a two - year public inquiry , which concluded last month , into its appalling standards of care			1
official documents suggest up to 1,200 more patients than expected died at the @entity184 site between 2005 and 2008			0
sir @entity185 , who chaired the inquiry , has said the true figure may never be known			0
the central @entity189 hearing , which @entity1 is attending , but @entity108 is not , continues			2
sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons .			0
