savings of up to £ 1million held in a failing bank will be protected for up to six months , as regulators strive to avoid a repeat of the panic when @entity5 faced collapse			2
the @entity7 yesterday announced a range of measures designed to protect savers and taxpayers from another financial crisis			1
they include automatically transferring savers to a different bank account if their own lender is collapsing			0
it is hoped this will give peace of mind to those who have just sold their home , received an inheritance or a large pay - out from an insurance policy			0
instead of the current limit of £ 85,000 , deposits of up to £ 1milllion will be guaranteed for up to six months under the @entity41 , the @entity7 said the temporary £ 1million limit - introduced in july next year - would cover around 99pc of house sales in the @entity43 - and 92pc in @entity44			1
there will be no limit in the protection for pay - outs on personal injury claims			0
the added protection will also prevent customers from having to split their money into £ 85,000 blocks to ensure their cash is covered			1
the government wants to avoid a repeat of the extraordinary scenes in september 2007 when customers formed huge queues outside @entity5 branches to withdraw their money , in the first run on a @entity43 bank for more than a century			1
savers with pensions and insurance policies will also receive more protection if their insurance company goes bust , with 100pc of the income from annuities protected under the compensation scheme instead of 90pc			0
last night one leading mp welcomed the move			0
@entity84 , the @entity85 chairman of the @entity86 said : “ with deposit insurance set at £ 85,000 , many people at some stage in their lives could be briefly vulnerable to a catastrophic loss when they transact on a house or receive a legacy			2
although the risk is very small something needs to be done – those people need some protection			0
’ a key priority of the @entity7 since the recent financial crisis has been to ensure banks are allowed to fail , without causing a meltdown in the financial system and disruption for customers			1
the government and regulators have pledged that taxpayers will never again be forced to bail out failed banks , following the £ 46billion injection of public money into @entity101 and the £ 20bn rescue of @entity103 during the financial crisis			1
under proposals announced by the @entity7 yesterday , if a smaller bank goes bust customers ’ accounts will be automatically transferred to another lender within 24 hours so they can continue to withdraw their cash and use their cards			1
failing that customers should receive pay - outs from the @entity41 within seven days instead of the current 20 days			2
there measures are set to come into force in the second half of 2016			0
under the new ‘ bail - in ’ regime , if a bigger bank collapses investors and bondholders will take the first hit and lose some or all of their money			0
it is hoped this will minimise disruption for savers who will continue to have access to the £ 85,000 or more they have guaranteed under the compensation scheme			1
@entity131 , deputy governor of the bank of england and chief executive of the @entity7 ’s financial safety watchdog the @entity135 , said : @entity131 : ‘ these proposals will allow customers to have continuous access to the money in their bank account – of receive payment from the @entity41 is this is not possible ’ ‘ these proposals will allow customers to have continuous access to the money in their bank account – of receive payment from the @entity41 is this is not possible			1
’ big lenders will be forced to ‘ ringfence ’ their @entity149 retail operations from their investment banks by january 2019 , insulating ordinary savers from the risky activities of so - called ‘ casino banks			0
’ the changes are expected to cost the industry between £ 1.7billion and £ 4.4billion , with industry experts warning mortgage rates could go up and savings rates could fall as banks pass on the costs to their customers			2
banks will have to submit their preliminary plans on how they expect to restructure their operations by december .			0
