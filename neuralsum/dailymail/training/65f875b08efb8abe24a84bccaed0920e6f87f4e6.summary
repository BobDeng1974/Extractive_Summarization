by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 14:55 est , 31 january 2014 updated : 15:03 est , 31 january 2014 attempts by @entity5 to extradite @entity6 from the @entity7 are doomed to failure , diplomatic sources have warned			2
the 26 - year - old @entity7 is at the centre of a diplomatic tug of war after an @entity12 court on thursday sentenced her to 28 years prison for the murder of @entity18 student @entity16			1
@entity19 served four years jail for the 2007 murder , but returned home to @entity23 in 2011 , when she and former boyfriend @entity25 were acquitted on appeal			1
@entity6 reacting to an interviewers questions about a @entity1 court upholding the guilty verdict for her and her former boyfriend during her recent interview on @entity34 's @entity33 show in @entity35 ( @entity36 ) @entity19 preparing to leave the set following her television interview			1
@entity19 said she will fight the reinstated guilty verdict against her and an ex-boyfriend in the 2007 slaying of a @entity18 roommate in @entity12 and vowed to ' never go willingly ' to face her fate in that country 's judicial system following the dramatic quashing of that acquittal , followed by the reinstatement of her conviction , @entity19 said she will never willingly go back to @entity12 , and will instead become ‘ a fugitive ’			1
once the murder sentence is confirmed by the @entity55 , @entity12 can apply for @entity19 's extradition and arrest			1
but despite expected @entity12 efforts , experts say the @entity60 will never send @entity19 back to a country where she was allegedly beaten by police and interrogated for hours without a lawyer or translator			2
@entity25 , @entity6 's former boyfriend , leaving after attending the final hearing before the third court verdict for the murder of @entity18 student @entity16 , in @entity1 , @entity12 thanks to a powerful public relations campaign , and a prison memoir , @entity19 has successfully won over millions in the @entity7 to her cause counting @entity75 among her supporters			1
even early on senators petitioned @entity78 on her behalf , claiming it was ' an anti-american trial '			0
and @entity60 sources now reveal the 26 - year - old has little to fear as she will be protected by the strength of public opinion in @entity7			0
the @entity5 - based source confided : ‘ we will never send her back to @entity12			2
it ’s obvious she has n’t had a fair trial			0
’ @entity6 has said she counts @entity7 property mogul @entity75 as one of her supporters , seen here speaking during a media event on the sand dunes of the @entity94 estate , @entity95 , the site for a proposed golf resort in 2010 the @entity7 @entity55 still has to verify and enforce the @entity12 verdict in order for @entity6 to be extradited , but many critics claim that no secretary of state will ever make the decision to send her back to @entity12 once the guilty verdict is confirmed by the @entity55 , @entity12 will almost certainly apply to extradite @entity19 , because of the expectation from the public to do so , another foreign policy expert said			1
‘ they will have go through the motions because of the public pressure to do so , even though they know it will fail			0
no @entity7 secretary of state will ever send her back , the source claimed			2
he added : ‘ the @entity12 have to support own judiciary			0
they ca n’t just do nothing when the judiciary sentence someone for murder			0
’ in the same way , @entity18 used to routinely apply for the extradition of criminals living on the @entity123 , knowing that the attempts were wasted efforts , he explained			0
‘ but the government ca n’t be seen to do nothing ’ .			0

@entity19 was sentenced to 28 years in prison by a court in @entity1 for murder
she already served four years for the crime , returning to @entity23 in 2011
the @entity7 @entity55 has to confirm the guilty verdict before extradition
