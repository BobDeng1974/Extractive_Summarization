by @entity0 published : 04:43 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 06:43 est , 19 june 2013 when a barrel of glowing green radioactive ooze was spilt into the sewers of @entity6 and landed on four lost pet turtles , it spawned ' the world 's most fearsome fighting team '			1
however the @entity10 have yet to be spotted fighting crime in @entity12 , where a man checking out a sinkhole in a street saw something unexpected inside â € ” a pool of what looked like green ooze			1
@entity20 said the sinkhole opened in the @entity22 section of the city last week and the ooze appeared several days later			2
suspicious : the green ooze spotted by @entity20 in the @entity22 district of @entity12 he said when he and some friends spotted the green pool , they didnâ € ™ t know what to make of it			1
' we kind of walked over and looked and saw the neon green and said , " @entity34 , look at that " , ' said mr @entity20			2
he was right to be concerned , for where there is green ooze , according to the seminal @entity39 and early - @entity42 cartoon and comic book series , there may well be mutants			2
according to the @entity46 , green ooze was poured into the sewers by the evil ninja villain shredder in an attempt to poison his honourable ninja rival @entity51 , who was living there after his exile from the @entity54			1
but the plan only half worked and @entity51 was transformed into an anthropomorphic rat , and four turtles he had discovered and taken as pets to become humanoid themselves			0
@entity51 adopts the four mutant amphibians as his sons and trains them in the art of ninjutsu , whereupon they vow to take revenge on shredder and halt his criminal career			0
heroes in a half shell : the turtles were spawned after a barrel of similar looking green ooze was poured into a @entity6 storm sewer by the evil ninja shredder , mutating four lost amphibians into the teenage vigilantes the hole had been boarded up by the time mr @entity20 checked it again later that day , he said , adding that similar sinkholes appear every year and appear to be moving down the road			1
@entity82 , director of labs for the @entity84 , said the colouring is simply dye , which helps workers determine the origins of sinkholes			0
workers pour the dye into flowing water underground , he said , then go to a manhole down the street and look into it			0
if they see the color they poured into the system , they know the water is flowing in that direction			0
mr @entity82 stressed the dye is safe , non-toxic and biodegradable .			0

similar - looking green ooze poured into @entity6 storm sewer by the evil ninja shredder spawned the heroes in a half shell
however , the world 's most fearsome fighting team have yet to be spotted *stalking* the streets of the @entity12
local *official* *disappointingly* *explains* that the *strange* - coloured stuff is merely dye to find the source of the leak
