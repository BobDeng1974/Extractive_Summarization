by @entity0 published : 10:19 est , 26 march 2012 updated : 10:49 est , 26 march 2012 @entity1 may soon have to ditch its nickname of the @entity3 - as it is sinking into the water more than five times quicker than previously thought			2
scientists say the city is also tilting to the east and heading out to the @entity9 , as it is hit by more floods than ever before			1
previous studies had shown water - levels in the former capital of the @entity14 had stabilised			2
but the new research claims it has actually submerged , and tilted to the east , by an unprecedented 2mm per year over the last decade			2
the patches of land in @entity1 's 117 island lagoon are also sinking			2
northern sections are dropping between 2 to 3mm per year , while the southern lagoon is subsiding by 3 to 4mm over the same period			0
@entity36 , research geodesist with @entity38 at @entity39 , said : ' @entity1 appears to be continuing to subside			0
it 's a small effect , but it 's important			0
' city of water : it may be known as a water lover 's paradise , but things are taken a step too far when entire streets and pathways are flooded , like in 2008 normal service : @entity51 's @entity24 pictured on a non-waterlogged day @entity36 , who is publishing a study in @entity54 's journal @entity55 on wednesday , said the current subsidence was due to natural causes , such as plate tectonics			1
' the @entity9 plate , which includes @entity1 , subducts beneath the @entity60 and causes the city and its environs to drop slightly in elevation , ' he said			1
population : 270,098 name derived from ancient @entity67 people nicknames : queen of the @entity9 , @entity70 , @entity71 , and the @entity3 stretches across 117 small islands in marshy @entity74 along the @entity9 in northeast @entity75 saltwater lagoon stretches along shoreline between mouths of the @entity79 ( south ) and the @entity80 ( north ) @entity81 was major maritime power during @entity83 and @entity84 played important role in history of symphonic and operatic music : birthplace of @entity89 and he added that the frequency of floods in @entity1 is increasing			1
residents now have to , about four or five times each year , walk on wooden planks to stay above the floodwaters in large parts of the city			1
the study may spark fears not enough is being done to save the city 's @entity102 and @entity103 palazzos from plunging into the water			1
but experts at @entity107 , a group in charge of safeguarding @entity1 and the lagoon , highlighted concerns about the report			0
a source told @entity113 : ' i learned about the new research from journalists like yourself			0
' we have records of the subsiding of @entity1 for hundreds of years , and yet they have n’t called us			0
' we have calculated the city has been sinking 3 to 4cms per century			1
' now they say 2mm per year … that means @entity1 would sink 20cm every 100 years			0
that 's more than five times more than we calculated			0
so i ’ll believe it when i see it			0
' only get worse : a woman walks on @entity24 during floods in 2008 , which experts say is a serious sign of things to come and @entity36 himself admitted a multi-billion dollar investment in the city 's flood defence system would hopefully prevent the tourist destination from sinking into the abyss			1
he said : ' a multi-billion - dollar effort to install flood - protection walls that can be raised to block incoming tides is nearing completion			0
' the adjustable barriers were designed to protect the city from tides that are coming in higher as overall sea levels are rising in response to climate change			1

city also *gradually* tilting eastwards into @entity9
