by @entity0 , mail online deputy political editor @entity5 's churches are at risk of turning into giant ' bat barns ' , a @entity3 peer has warned			1
@entity8 said the flying animals were a ' terrible problem ' for parishes - with the smell and mess of bat droppings proving an ' intolerable burden ' for vicars			1
the former @entity3 mp said he had been told of one occasion when a vicar had to ' shake bat faeces out of her hair while celebrating holy communion at the altar '			1
the number of bats roosting in @entity5 's churches - particularly in @entity26 - is a menace to vicars , a leading @entity3 peer has claimed he said bats were a ' menace ' to churches and it was time for a fightback against nature lovers			1
@entity3 peer @entity37 , speaking for the government , said there was a ' bat helpline ' to give free advice on helping churches deal with the problem			1
but @entity8 said : ' the impression is that bats matter much more than the worshipping community and this is exacerbated by the fact @entity48 abrogated responsibility to the @entity50 , who are quite legitimately a pressure group			1
' he added : ' this is a subject that is not sufficiently aired but it really is a very true danger			0
' if this debate achieved only one thing - a better balance between the demands of @entity61 and the needs of @entity63 - i would be well content			0
' @entity3 peer @entity8 said one vicar had to remove bat faeces from her hair while celebrating holy communion at the alter the @entity69 , the @entity70 , said there had been a lot of meetings with @entity48 and the government on the problem of bats and there had been some positive developments			1
but he added : ' it is always odd to me that our parish churches seem to be treated much more as barns than as houses			2
' they are places where people gather and to eat - not just the sacrament of holy communion but more socially as well - and i doubt any other eating place would be allowed to be so unhygienic			0
' musical impresario @entity90 urged the government to set up a national heritage memorial fund to protect and promote works of art in parish churches			1
the @entity99 peer said : ' we have to fight passionately for the future of our parish churches			2
' he warned that protecting works of art like stained glass windows was beyond the means of some churches and suggested a fund should be created to do the job			0
@entity90 said anything that people could do to further the use of churches as the centre of communities had to be good			0
' we should have @entity117 in churches , ' he added			0
' if we have @entity117 you could have an app and that app could say look this is what this building is about			0
' lord @entity125 , replying to the debate for the government , said : ' most medieval churches will have bats and it seems that @entity131 churches seem to have particular problems in this respect			2
' historical buildings , especially churches , play an important role in helping to protect the conservation and status of native bats			0
' in a changing landscape churches can represent one of the few remaining constant resources for bats , thus giving them a disproportionate significance for the maintenance of bat populations			2

@entity3 peer @entity8 says bat *infestations* are ' an intolerable burden '
says flying animals roosting in churches leave ' terrible ' smell and mess
government said there is now a ' bat helpline ' for parishes struggling to cope
