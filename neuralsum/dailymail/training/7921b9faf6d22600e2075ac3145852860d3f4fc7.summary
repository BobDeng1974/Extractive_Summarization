bitter charity : @entity31 of the @entity32 in @entity33 is astonished at so much precious , wasted food @entity31 , executive director of @entity33 ’s @entity32 , watched footage from @entity36 in @entity37 , and was shocked as two heavy - duty construction vehicles repeatedly trounce through huge mounds of bright purple cookie boxes			1
gleeful garbage men : a voice voice yells ' goodbye , girl scout cookies ! ' in the footage taken last may @entity31 ’s organization serves young children , the working poor , the disabled , and other needy groups in @entity49			2
they ’re supplied through food donations , but must purchase around half their food to meet demand			2
sans giving : the crushed cookies were traced to the @entity55 of @entity56 ‘ we would gladly accept the cookies , ’ @entity31 said , still awed by the video he ’d seen			2
‘ they would probably disappear as fast as any product we have here			0
’ the cookies , which were well within their expiration dates , were traced to the @entity64 of the @entity3 in @entity65 , @entity4			1
finger pointing : @entity67 rep @entity66 blamed their supplier , @entity68 in @entity70 , @entity71 a representative from the council , @entity66 , avoided saying he was unaware the cookies had been destroyed			2
‘ we did n’t know that was the way they were being disposed of , ’ he said			0
@entity66 , on seeing the video , reacted with simple if not terribly regretful words			0
‘ to look at it , it ’s a waste of food			0
’ thin mints happens : a @entity85 's @entity3 rep told reporters , ' food is wasted all the time ' @entity66 pointed the blame at his supplier , @entity68 in @entity70 , @entity71 and said it was they who destroyed the cookies			1
basically , he said , his council had bitten off more than they could chew			0
one percent of unsold boxes , @entity66 said , can be returned to the bakery at no charge and he and his council had ordered far more than they could sell			0
that one percent totalled 13,200 boxes of cookies , the very cookies seen in the video			1
not this year : the @entity67 claim that just last year they donated 100,000 boxes , but evidently that did n't happen this year @entity68 has not commented on the cookie smashing footage			1
however , a spokesperson at the @entity3 headquarters in @entity107 was less than apologetic			0
‘ it ’s a shame what happened in @entity111 , ’ said representative @entity108 , ‘ but food is wasted all the time			1
’ @entity66 , meanwhile , promised @entity64 will be taking steps to avoid a similar debacle in the future by placing smaller orders			0
the @entity64 of @entity3 also claims they have donated unsold cookies in the past , saying 100,000 boxes were given out last year alone			1
it remains unclear , however , why these particular boxies were , instead , smashed to bits .			1

1,100 cases of the *coveted* *confections* were smashed to bits as bulldozer operators *hooted* ' @entity126 ! '
the 13,200 boxes of fresh cookies could have been donated and @entity4 charities are up in arms
' food is wasted all the time ' says @entity135 headquarters
