many women are understandably anxious about starting to breastfeed			0
but @entity1 admits she was slightly more worried than most , after her daughter @entity2 was born with two fully formed front teeth			1
most babies start teething at around six months , but @entity2 astounded nurses and midwives at the @entity7 in @entity8 with her pearly white incisors			2
when she came round , her husband @entity26 told her their daughter had been born with teeth			1
she said : ' the midwives had never seen a baby with teeth before			0
' everybody came to the ward to see her â€“ you could tell it was rare , ' she told @entity37			0
teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth			1
doctors say they occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies			1
they usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure , meaning they are often wobbly			0
mrs @entity1 , who also has a two - year - old son @entity44 , said she and her husband were so surprised by their daughter 's appearance that they sent a picture of them to their friends and family			1
she said the incisors looked like normal teeth , only smaller			0
and luckily , breastfeeding did n't hurt as much as she had expected			0
' i was worried about breastfeeding her but it did n't hurt , ' she said			0
' i could not actually feel her teeth			0
' it turned out that @entity2 is not the first baby in the family to be born with gnashers - the family later learned her grandmother was also born with one front tooth			1
@entity2 's teeth , which were in the middle of her lower gum , were removed three days after she was born this is often the case with natal teeth because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them			1
they can also injure the baby 's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain			2
@entity2 had to be fed with bottled milk until the teeth were removed , but mrs @entity1 could resume breastfeeding again after that			1
she is still expected to grow a full set of baby teeth			0
her mother added : ' i was given a little toothfairy box at her baby shower and i never thought i would be using it so soon - especially for @entity2 before her older brother @entity44			1
' teeth that a child is born with are known as natal teeth			2
they occur in about one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies			1
they usually develop in the lower gums and have little root structure meaning they are often wobbly			0
they are not usually well formed but can injure the baby 's tongue when it is breastfeeding and can cause a breastfeeding mother pain			2
@entity108 teeth are often removed shortly after a baby is born because if they are loose there is a danger of the child choking on them			2
these teeth are not usually associated with any other medical problems			0
there is no known explanation for them other than that a child is more dentally developed			0
' i was given a little toothfairy box at her baby shower and i never thought i would be using it so soon ' said mrs @entity1 , who decided to keep daughter @entity128 teeth in a jar as a souvenir			1

@entity1 woke up from @entity12 to be told her daughter had two teeth
@entity136 's teeth were fully formed - but were removed after three days
these ' natal ' teeth can be loose - so must be removed in case baby chokes
mrs @entity1 , 25 , resumed breastfeeding her daughter after the removal
she and her husband have kept @entity2 's first teeth in a jar as a souvenir
doctors say natal teeth occur in one in every 2,000 to 3,000 babies
