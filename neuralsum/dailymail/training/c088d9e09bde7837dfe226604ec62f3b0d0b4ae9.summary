by @entity0 dozens of underperforming schools could be removed from council control and handed to ‘ super-heads ’ in the wake of alleged @entity7 takeover plots			1
@entity8 is considering stripping @entity11 ’s @entity10 - run council of the power to run many of its schools			1
the @entity15 ’s intervention comes amid claims radical @entity17 tried to overthrow heads and governors and push through strict @entity17 practices			1
@entity8 is considering stripping the @entity10 - run council of its power to control @entity11 's schools but the plan to remove failing schools from council control is said to extend beyond so - called @entity28 schools to include those that fared poorly in @entity32 inspections			1
mr @entity8 is understood to fear that @entity11 , @entity33 ’s second largest city , has failed to provide decent education at dozens of schools			1
about 15 successful head teachers are expected to be invited to take over at the failing schools			0
those which already operate outside council control could also be reassigned to outstanding heads			2
the @entity40 in @entity11 - which , according to whistleblowers , has allegedly been infiltrated by @entity17 extremists who are attempting to change the school and target young people there are suggestions that responsibility for some or all of @entity11 ’s education and children ’s services could be given to an independent trust			1
the approach has been used previously in areas of poor performance – such as @entity55 in @entity56			0
@entity11 heads were told at a recent council meeting to expect a ‘ bloody firestorm ’ after investigations into the @entity28 allegations are published			2
@entity32 had to abandon an inspection of a private primary school after pupils as young as nine were questioned about their attitudes to homosexuality			2
parents were concerned after children told them inspectors had spoken privately to a group of nine and ten - year - olds at the @entity74 school , asking them : ‘ what does the word gay mean ? ’ and ‘ is it used in a bad way at school ? ’ it is claimed the children were also asked about terrorism and whether it was discussed			0
@entity32 was forced to cut short its visit to @entity82 in @entity83 after parents threatened to withdraw their children			2
@entity85 , 40 , said his ten - year - old son came home complaining about being asked ‘ scary and weird questions ’			0
he said the inspector told his son not to be offended , adding : ‘ it ’s just a part of the law we have to ask you			0
’ @entity32 apologised for upsetting parents , but a spokesman said : ‘ as part of any school inspection , inspectors will ask pupils about the effectiveness of the school ’s actions to prevent and tackle discriminatory and derogatory language – including homophobic language			2
’ @entity106 , @entity11 ’s chief executive , told his audience to prepare for ‘ significant structural changes ’ in the education department , leaked recordings reveal			0
four investigations are being conducted into claims that orchestrated attempts were made to impose a hardline @entity17 agenda on @entity11 state schools			1
these include a probe by @entity32 , which has carried out snap inspections at 21 schools and is preparing individual reports and an overview , due in early june			1
leaks claim several of the schools will be put in special measures			0
any schools removed from council control would be converted into academies run by outside trusts involving experienced heads			1
@entity130 , chief executive of @entity131 , which oversees three schools in the city , is one of those expected to be approached for the role			0
he told the @entity137 ministers had asked outstanding heads ‘ to take responsibility for certain schools ’ and that the move highlighted the council ’s failure to take ‘ responsibility for the education of young people ’			1
@entity32 chief sir @entity147 last year described @entity11 ’s children ’s services as a ‘ national disgrace ’ and suggested the authority may need to be broken up			0
the authenticity of the letter which originally described ‘ @entity154 ’ is open to question but the @entity155 reported that its own casework had shown ‘ concerted efforts ’ to change the character of at least six schools			0
a @entity161 spokesman said it would be ‘ inappropriate ’ to comment before @entity32 publishes its report .			0
