by @entity0 published : 05:35 est , 15 january 2014 updated : 13:12 est , 15 january 2014 are you an hourglass like @entity4 or rectangle - shaped like @entity5 ? you may think you have finally managed to figure out which body shape you are			2
it 's time to get back to the drawing board because a new way of categorising your figure is about to land			0
the women of @entity13 are using ‘ @entity17 ’ , or matching their bodies with certain letters , to identify their shape			1
so which is which and what shape does everyone want to be ? @entity22 break them down one by one			0
the most desirable is the s - line , a body shape with ample breasts and buttocks when viewed from the side			1
@entity13 singer and actress @entity30 is well - known for her s - line body			1
in western culture , @entity33 - who often tops polls for having the sexiest body - is the perfect example of the s - line			1
they got it ! @entity33 has an @entity41 - ample breasts and buttocks when viewed from the side			1
this body shape is know as the most desirable the v - line - a slim and oval face narrowing towards the chin - is another coveted shape			1
the entire concept behind it is so your face looks smaller , which is considered beautiful in @entity13			2
@entity13 women and models often pose with their fists or peace - sign hands in front of their faces , to create this illusion ; @entity5 has a v - line face shape			1
chiseled : @entity5 possesses a @entity61 - a slim and oval face narrowing towards the chin			1
models often pose with objects in front of their face ( r ) to create this illusion there is also the @entity70 , is basically exactly how the letter looks : long legs and arms connected by a narrow waist			0
picture the meeting point of the two lines is the waist and there you have it - or look to supermodel @entity80 who possessed this athletic body shape			0
in @entity13 , the @entity82 is sought after by younger women in high school or college			2
famous physiques : @entity80 has an @entity82 , which is long legs and arms connected by a narrow waist , and highly sought after by college students the @entity89 , which outlines the shape of a woman ’s back when she wears a low - cut dress , was showcased to perfection by @entity95 in her questionable @entity97 dress			0
the look is considered a daring and sexy one and can be accentuated by low - cut backless dresses a la miss @entity95			0
a back like @entity100 : @entity95 showcases the @entity89 , which outlines the shape of a woman 's back when she wears a low - cut dress d ­ - line denotes a pregnant , or pregnant - looking , stomach			1
baby bump : the d - line figure depicts a pregnant woman , as shown by @entity33 b - line means a big bust and stomach			1
@entity111 is a rather busty lady			0
busty : b - line means a big bust , as showcased by celebrity chef @entity111 , and stomach the o - line , which stands for obese , is the least desired body shape amongst @entity13			1
@entity118 weighed in at 19 stone before her incredible weight loss , classing her as obese			0
o - line : this letter stands for an obese body			2
at 19 stone , @entity118 was classed as obese but has since shed an incredible amount of weight @entity17 is mainly reserved for women but men can be categorised as m - line for having a six - pack			1
the alphabet code is big business in @entity13 culture and singers and actresses often refer to their body lines			2
the differing body lines also feature on beauty products , drinks , lingerie , music and diet supplements			2
' some of these ads insist that whatever product they ’re selling will help you obtain the desired contour ; others ( like the beer ad ) just traffic in the allure of the letter to make their product seem cool , ' writes @entity154 on @entity155			0
what shape are you ? the women of @entity13 are using ' @entity158 ' , which matches their bodies with certain letters , to identify their shape - it is even used in marketing for beer brands ( pictured ) so where did the bizarre trend begin ? it has been claimed that a weight - loss drink used the @entity169 waist in its marketing campaign in 2008 and it has taken off ever since			1
and judging by recent figures which revealed that @entity13 have more plastic surgery than any other nation , it 's hardly surprising that they 're such a self - conscious nation			2
those in the @entity179 country have more treatments per members of the population , with one in every 77 turning to the knife or needle			0
the figures , from the @entity186 ( @entity186 ) , show that in 2011 , 15 million people across the globe turned to plastic surgery to enhance their looks			0
coveted : the most popular is the @entity41 - ample breasts and buttocks when viewed from the side - as shown on this drinks advert while the popularity of cosmetic surgery in @entity13 may come as a surprise to many , the industry there is in fact booming			1
last year , 20 per cent of women aged 19 to 49 in the capital city of @entity202 admitted to going under the knife			0
one of the most popular surgical procedures is double eyelid surgery - which reduces excess skin in the upper eyelid to make the eyes appear bigger and make them look more ' western '			0
it is believed that the rise of the country 's music industry is behind the boom , and many patients visit clinics with photos of celebrities , asking surgeons to emulate @entity220 noses or eyes .			0
