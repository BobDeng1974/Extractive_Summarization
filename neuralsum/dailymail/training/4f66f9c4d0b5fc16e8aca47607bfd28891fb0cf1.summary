by @entity0 published : 05:34 est , 21 november 2012 updated : 13:43 est , 7 december 2012 next year could bring a new twist in the evolution of the smartphone			0
@entity4 are gearing up to produce flexible , unbreakable mobile phone screens that can be bent , twisted and even folded up and put in your wallet			1
the @entity9 tech giant reportedly has the flexible screens in the final stage of development and will be ready to ship them next year			2
@entity4 is not the only company to have invested heavily in research into flexible screens using @entity22			2
companies including @entity31 's @entity30 and @entity32 , also of @entity9 have launched prototypes			0
however @entity4 is the first to promise a launch date for the technology , with an unnamed source ' familiar with the situation ' telling the @entity38 they will ship in the first half of 2013			1
looking at the release dates of the company 's flagship smartphones , the @entity43 , that suggests that the first device to feature the flexible screen technology could be the yet to be announced @entity46			1
the company 's move to produce the flexible displays comes as smartphone and tablet makers search for ways to differentiate their products in a market where customers face a glut of almost identical products			0
@entity15 : the breakthrough has been made by through the use of organic light emitting diodes ( @entity22 ) , which are thin and can be put on flexible material such as plastic or metal foil @entity64 , director of mobile and emerging displays and technology at @entity68 and @entity69 , told @entity70 : ' @entity71 can help @entity4 differentiate its products in a smartphone market where most products offer similar products and functionality			1
' even if @entity4 were not able to able able to commercialise flexible screens straight away , making their screens out of plastic rather than glass would make their devices lighter , more durable and cheaper than rivals '			1
a common bugbear with the kinds of touchscreen displays often used on mobile devices is that they are brittle and prone to cracking			1
replacing the glass now used with plastic would solve that problem			0
durable : although being bendy is their most exciting characteristic , simply using plastic to manufacture the screens rather than glass could help make phone screens less likely to crack @entity4 had previously promised to bring flexible displays to market this year , but that deadline came and went without any announcement from the company			1
flexible displays are made by depositing organic light emitting diodes on a flexible plastic surface			1
regular led displays are usually made on a glass surface , but substituting that for a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate makes it possible to manufacture screens that are both flexible and lightweight			0
one possible mass - production method might use a technique similar to inkjet printing			0
however , the company 's push for innovation has become more urgent as other display makers are also introducing different technologies for mobile phone and tablet screens			0
@entity30 has been researching the same flexible screen technology since 2002 , and showcased a 4.1in flexible oled two years ago , the same time as @entity4 showed off their version of the technology			2
however , a spokesman for @entity30 told the @entity38 he could n't comment on when the company would begin mass producing the displays			0
and earlier this year , @entity131 filed a patent for ' electronic devices with flexible displays ' that included features like on - screen keyboards that can be modified to handle concave or convex curves			2
@entity138 , vice president of @entity4 's display division , told the @entity38 his company has sent out samples of the new displays to a few select customers , but added that the release dates of any new products using the technology has not yet been confirmed			2
the bendy technology is unveiled in this @entity9 tv ad			0

breakthrough made by the use of organic light - emitting diodes
