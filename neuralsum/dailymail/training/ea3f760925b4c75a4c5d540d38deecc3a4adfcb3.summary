police in @entity1 , @entity2 , were following the scent of something sweet - millions of dollars ' worth of maple syrup missing from a large warehouse stocking over $ 30million worth of the amber nectar			1
the theft puts a cavity - sized dent in @entity1 's syrup stock , considered to be a global strategic reserve of the sweet stuff that is often used to replenish markets during disappointing seasons			1
@entity1 produces up to 80 per cent of the world 's maple syrup			1
@entity1 provincial sgt @entity17 said on friday that it was too soon to determine the exact quantity or value of the maple syrup stolen from the @entity24 - @entity23 facility where over 10 million pounds is stored , but it is likely that millions of dollars worth of the product were taken			1
the federation is the industry association for the province 's 7,500 syrup producers , and administers a bulk sale system with quotas on individual operations , according to @entity48			0
if every drop of syrup was stolen from the warehouse , it would represent more than a tenth of @entity1 's harvest for this year , and more than a quarter of the federation 's inventory			1
officials initially kept the news quiet , hoping it would help police solve the crime			0
@entity63 - @entity62 , the executive director of the federation , said that while it is not unusual for individual maple syrup producers to have stock stolen , having millions worth of syrup stolen is ‘ unusual			1
’ ‘ it 's the first time something like this has happened , ’ she said			0
‘ we 've never seen a robbery of this magnitude			0
’ she said the disappearance of the stock was not obvious at first in the huge warehouse			0
the facility alone houses nearly the equivalent of half the entire @entity81 production of maple syrup in a year , she said			2
sticky situation : if the stolen syrup makes its way onto the market , it could hurt some 10,000 @entity1 producers ‘ the @entity81 market is the main market for maple syrup , about 75 per cent of @entity94 maple syrup is directly exported to the @entity81 , ’ she said			1
she noted the theft was particularly ill - timed after a disappointing 2012 season for @entity81 producers , triggering more demand for @entity94 syrup			2
she said auditors would require a few more days to determine how many of the 45 - gallon barrels have been emptied			2
theft of stock at the individual producer level prompted the industry in @entity1 to group inventory in locations such as this , @entity102 said			0
while the federation is insured for the loss , if the stolen syrup makes its way onto the market , it could hurt the group 's 10,000 members , @entity110 reported			0
video : the industry is now worred that a @entity120 black market will emerge ...			0

syrup was stolen from the @entity24 - @entity23 site where over *10million* pounds of the sweet stuff is stored
*thieves* emptied the syrup from barrels and somehow transferred it into other containers
if entire contents of the facility was stolen , it would represent more than tenth of @entity1 's 2012 syrup harvest
