as someone who loves ice cream , @entity0 was disappointed when he was diagnosed with lactose intolerance			1
the retired banker from @entity5 , @entity6 , developed the symptoms in 1998			0
he 'd had a tummy bug on holiday in @entity10 , but it kept flaring up , especially when he ate anything creamy			0
' whenever i had ice cream or cheesecake i 'd have terrible cramps and need to rush to the loo all night , ' says @entity0 , 53			0
one in five people have had lactose intolerance at some time his gp ran blood tests and diagnosed lactose intolerance - when the body is unable to digest lactose , the sugar found in milk			1
one in five people have had this condition at some time - it can be permanent or occur temporarily after a gut infection or surgery			2
@entity0 's @entity19 thought it was due to the holiday gastroenteritis			0
it had apparently damaged the lining of the bowel , meaning it could no longer break down lactose			2
the advice was to build up his tolerance by eating only small portions of dairy products until he got used to them again , which could take three months			0
but it did n't work			0
every month @entity0 would have another flare - up			2
and they were getting worse - by 2008 , he was rushing to the loo up to eight times a day			2
it got so bad that on some days he simply would n't eat so his body had nothing to get rid of			0
over six months , he lost a stone in weight			0
colitis and lactose intolerance have many crossover symptoms , such as abdominal pain and tiredness it was more than ten years after his symptoms had first appeared that he finally discovered the real cause of his troubles			1
@entity0 had spotted blood and mucus in his stools and his gp referred him to the @entity63 , where he had an endoscopy - a telescopic examination of his bowel			2
the result showed that he had ulcerative colitis - an inflammatory condition of the large bowel that 's linked to an over-active immune system and can be serious			1
up to 120,000 @entity71 are thought to have this condition , yet experts warn the true number may be far higher , because symptoms can often be mistaken for food allergies , stress or lactose @entity78 's easy to misdiagnose colitis as lactose intolerance because eating dairy can exacerbate both conditions			1
the number of people with ulcerative colitis who will ultimately need surgery ' it 's not uncommon for treatment to be delayed if symptoms are blamed on more common conditions , such as irritable bowel syndrome or lactose intolerance , ' says dr @entity92 , consultant gastroenterologist and medical adviser to @entity94 's and @entity95			1
colitis and lactose intolerance have many crossover symptoms , such as diarrhoea , abdominal pain and tiredness			1
' but importantly lactose intolerance does not cause bleeding , ' says dr @entity92			1
and diarrhoea caused by lactose intolerance should improve within a month or two			1
@entity0 's doctor , dr @entity105 , consultant gastroenterologist at @entity63 and @entity5 and @entity106 , says : ' if someone has changes in bowel habits lasting more than six weeks , they should see their gp to rule out serious conditions , including @entity94 's , ulcerative colitis or bowel cancer , rather than assume dairy is the trigger			1
' but as more common conditions such as lactose intolerance can mask @entity94 's and colitis , diagnosis is often delayed			1
@entity0 may never have had lactose intolerance at all - those symptoms could have been caused by early - stage colitis			1
' it 's crucial that ulcerative colitis is controlled with treatment			1
having to rush to the toilet up to 20 times a day is unpleasant and disruptive			0
it is important to confirm that there is not something more serious going on ' but uncontrolled inflammation of the large bowel over many years can lead to serious conditions , including perforation of the bowel , which is life - threatening			1
' it can also lead to bowel cancer , as continued inflammation and healing allow abnormal growths to form			2
' immediately after his ulcerative colitis diagnosis , @entity0 took a short course of steroids and anti-inflammatory medication , which got the condition under control			1
with his bowel in a more healthy state , he found he could tolerate small quantities of dairy products again			2
' i 'd have flare - ups every few months , but i was much better , ' says @entity0			0
however , in march 2012 , tests revealed ulcers on his large bowel , caused by the years of uncontrolled inflammation			1
@entity0 was told he might eventually need surgery to remove the diseased colon , meaning he would need a colostomy bag			0
a sports lover , @entity0 could n't bear the thought			0
doctors decided to try to control the disease with medication to spare him from surgery			0
dr @entity105 increased the dose of the anti-inflammatory medication and added azathioprine , an immunosuppressant			0
@entity0 's bowel healed and gradually the bouts of diarrhoea became less frequent			0
' now that it 's under control , i only need a low - dose medication of @entity179 to reduce inflammation , ' says @entity0 , who runs daily and is playing football again			2
' i still have a bit of lactose intolerance , so am careful about eating creamy food			1
' but dr @entity105 says @entity0 's story should be seen as a cautionary tale for anyone who is suffering unexplained , long - standing digestive problems			0
' when people believe they have lactose intolerance , it is important to confirm that there is not something more serious going on , ' he says			1
' when @entity0 was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis , he 'd had it for almost a decade			2
patients who have blood in their stools or a persistent change in their bowel habit should always seek help			0
' @entity0 agrees : ' if i had n't blamed lactose intolerance for so long , i might have got help sooner			2
a test seemed to confirm i was lactose intolerant , but i had another , much more serious problem , too			0
