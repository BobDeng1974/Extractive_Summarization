@entity0 will have raised more than £ 1billion for charity once next year ’s appeal has finished			1
screenwriter @entity3 , who set up the charity in 1985 with @entity5 , said he hoped to pass the mark on @entity7 in march			1
according to its latest accounts , the charity still has £ 108million sitting in its investment portfolio			1
but mr @entity3 , who is the author of @entity18 and @entity19 , boasted that next year ’s @entity0 campaign was likely to net the charity more money than ever			1
the 57 - year - old told the @entity25 in @entity26 : ‘ unless a horrible scandal occurs and it turns out @entity5 has been killing and eating children all these years , i think we are going to cross a billion pounds			0
’ he joked : ‘ i think we ’re going to cross a billion rather earlier in the evening than we ’d like			0
you ’d have hoped we ’d reach a billion about 11.40pm			0
last year @entity30 ( pictured ) baked cakes for @entity0 at her home in @entity33 , @entity34 ‘ you ’d be able to say “ come on , reach a billion			1
” ‘ i think there will be something rather tiring about reaching a billon at 8.04pm and then saying “ who ’d like to help start the next billion ? ” in 2013 singer @entity38 - real name @entity38 - shaved her head for @entity0 ‘ so i think what we ’ll do is actually talk a lot about what each individual donation can do			2
i hope it will be an amazing year			0
’ a @entity0 spokesman said the charity has raised £ 960million to date			1
the last @entity7 , in 2013 , raised more than £ 75million in one night after an eight hour show on @entity50 and @entity51 , passing 2011 ’s record total of £ 74.3million			0
that year , it gave out more than £ 103million to good causes , principally to charities that fight poverty in @entity56			0
but it was mired in scandal after it emerged the charity had pumped millions of pounds of donations into controversial ‘ bombs , booze and fags ’ funds even as it backed projects to help victims of alcohol abuse , war and smoking - related illnesses			2
following a public backlash , the charity pledged to be ‘ more transparent ’ with its cash in future and said it would no longer invest in arms or tobacco firms , or companies ‘ whose primary business is the manufacture of alcohol products ’			1
during @entity0 broadcasts , celebrities including @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 have repeated the charity ’s pledge that ‘ for every pound the charity gets directly from the public a pound goes to helping transform the lives of people living with poverty and social injustice ’			2
the charity ’s latest accounts show it employs nearly 300 people with a £ 13million annual wage bill			1
chief executive @entity100 ’s pay has increased from £ 111,000 to £ 131,000 since 2008 , with five directors earning more than £ 80,000			0
according to its latest accounts , the charity still has £ 108million sitting in its investment portfolio a @entity0 spokesman said : ‘ there is always a significant amount of money that has been committed to charities and projects that is waiting to be paid out			1
this is because we pay grants in instalments , so that we can monitor how the money has been spent before giving the next instalment			0
‘ @entity0 takes grant making very seriously and works hard to ensure the money awarded is spent as agreed			2
‘ this money has been donated and it would be unprofessional to pay it all out in single payments without these checks			0
’ ‘ the salary of @entity0 ’s chief executive is approximately £ 34,000 less than the average for chief executives in the top 100 charities			0
