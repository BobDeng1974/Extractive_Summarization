by @entity0 the @entity1 today struck down a 35 - foot protest - free zone outside abortion clinics in @entity4			1
the justices were unanimous in ruling that extending a buffer zone 35 feet from clinic entrances violates the @entity9 rights of protesters			0
chief justice @entity11 said authorities have less intrusive ways to deal with problems outside the clinics and noted that most of the problems reported by police and the clinics occurred outside the @entity20 facility in @entity21 , and only on saturdays when the largest crowds typically gather			1
in a ruling today , the @entity1 struck down a 35 - foot protest - free zone outside abortion clinics in @entity4 saying it violates first amendment rights of protesters ' for a problem shown to arise only once a week in one city at one clinic , creating 35 - foot buffer zones at every clinic across the @entity37 is hardly a narrowly - tailored solution , ' @entity11 said			1
while the court was unanimous in the outcome , @entity11 joined with the four liberal justices to strike down the buffer zone on narrow grounds			2
in a separate opinion , justice @entity45 criticized @entity11 ' opinion for carrying forward ' this court 's practice of giving abortion - rights advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the free - speech rights of their opponents '			1
the case began when @entity21 - area grandmother @entity24 and other abortion opponents sued over the limits on their activities at @entity20 health centers in @entity21 , @entity60 and @entity61			1
' the government can not reserve its public sidewalks for @entity20 , as if their message is the only one women should be allowed to hear			2
' at the latter two sites , the protesters say they have little chance of reaching patients arriving by car because they must stay 35 feet from the entrance to those buildings ' parking lots			0
@entity20 provides health exams for women , cancer screenings , tests for sexually transmitted diseases , birth control and abortions at its clinics			1
the organization said that the buffer zone has significantly reduced the harassment of patients and clinic employees			0
before the 35 - foot zone went into effect in 2007 , protesters could stand next to the entrances and force patients to squeeze by , @entity20 said			2
before 2007 , a floating buffer zone kept protesters from approaching unwilling listeners any closer than 6 feet if they were within 18 feet of the clinic			0
the floating zone was modeled after a @entity99 law that the @entity1 upheld			0
that decision was not called into question in thursday 's ruling			0
clinic officials said they are most concerned about safety because of past incidents of violence			0
in 1994 , a gunman killed two receptionists and wounded five employees and volunteers at a @entity20 facility and another abortion clinic in nearby @entity113			1
the most recent killing was in 2009 , when dr. @entity115 , who performed abortions , was shot in a church in @entity118 , @entity119			0
abortion protesters said that other state and federal laws already protect health center workers and patients , as well as access to clinics			1
@entity127 , who represented the protesters at the @entity1 , said : ' the government can not reserve its public sidewalks for @entity20 , as if their message is the only one women should be allowed to hear			2
today 's decision confirms that the @entity9 is for everyone , and that the government can not silence peaceful speakers			0
that result is good news for @entity24 , and it is great news for the women she helps			0
