by @entity1 reporter published : 07:21 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 08:48 est , 28 february 2013 to his many friends and relatives , @entity2 was always larger than life			1
at 7ft 2in , though , the gentle giant sometimes admitted that being so tall was a burden			2
sadly , in death , his towering frame has left his loved ones facing extra heartache – over his funeral arrangements			2
' @entity13 ' : the family of the late 7ft 2in @entity2 face a 70 - mile round trip to cremate him because his local crematoriums ca n't cater for his giant coffin the two crematoriums nearest his home in @entity20 , @entity21 - on - @entity22 , turned them away saying mr @entity2 ’s 7ft 9in coffin is too big for them to cremate			1
it means the shocked relatives have had to organise two services for mr @entity2 – a funeral locally next thursday followed by a 70 - mile round trip for his cremation the following day			1
his cousin @entity32 , 47 , said yesterday : ‘ i have never heard anything like this before			2
i am completely taken aback and it has n’t quite sunk in yet			1
‘ it will have to be a two - day funeral which makes things quite awkward			1
but it is nobody ’s fault			2
‘ he is an exceptional case because of his height and the funeral directors have been great in trying to organise the ceremony			2
’ ' taken aback ' : @entity2 's cousin @entity32 ( pictured ) says funeral will now have to take place over two days former steel worker mr @entity2 , 72 , who also worked occasionally as a barman , reached his full height when he was only 15 and in 1967 was crowned @entity49 ’s @entity48			1
with a 54in waist , a 39in inside leg and weighing about 25st , he had to have his clothes and size 15 shoes specially made			0
he never married and , until they died in the 1980s , he lived with his parents @entity56 , who was 6ft 7in , and @entity58 , 6ft 2in			0
he died at his home on february 13 after suffering a ruptured aneurysm			2
his relatives were stunned when crematoriums at @entity63 in @entity64 and @entity65 in @entity66 - under - @entity67 said they could not take the coffin			1
so although a funeral service will be held at @entity63 , friends and family face a 35 - mile journey to @entity73 , @entity74 on @entity22 , the following day as the crematorium there is the nearest that can cater for such a large coffin			1
it means costs have spiralled			0
‘ i ’m not sure how much it will be in total because it ’s in the hands of the solicitors but i know we ’re going to wince when we see the bill , ’ mrs @entity32 said			0
‘ we ’ve got two separate services because a lot of his old pals wo n’t be able to get all the way to @entity73			0
we are expecting about 100 people to turn up			0
his height was always a bit of a burden to him			0
everybody called him the @entity98 of @entity20 or @entity99			0
you could n’t take your eyes off him			0
it was a bit frightening but he had a heart of gold			0
‘ he will be best remembered for his time spent in @entity107 ’ ex-servicemen ’s club playing cards and darts			0
’ @entity21 said the cremation equipment at @entity63 is the ‘ industry standard ’ size but cremation of a coffin over 7ft long had to be done at a specialist facility			1
turned away : the crematorium at @entity65 ( pictured ) , close to @entity2 's home in @entity64 , can only take coffins 7ft in length , whereas his is 7ft 9in ' @entity123 case ' : @entity124 ( pictured ) was also unable to accommodate his coffin			1

@entity2 passed away at his home in @entity64 at age of 72
two nearby crematoriums could not fit his 7ft 9in coffin into *furnaces*
@entity134 now face a 70 - mile round trip to facility that can cater for him
@entity139 : ' i am completely taken aback . it will have to be a two - day funeral '
former barman was crowned ' @entity49 's @entity48 ' in 1967
