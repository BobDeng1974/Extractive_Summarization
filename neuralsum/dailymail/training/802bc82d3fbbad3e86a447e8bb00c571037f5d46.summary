by @entity0 @entity1 has launched a defiant defence of his position as @entity5 head coach and stated his desire to be with the club on a journey to the @entity9			1
fourteen years have passed since @entity5 were competing with @entity11 's elite and @entity12 is the latest man to have been tasked with setting the club back on the road to former glories			1
his time in charge looked to have ended at the weekend , though , when owner @entity19 decided to sack him just five games into his tenure , only to perform a dramatic u-turn and then place the blame for the club 's poor start to the @entity28 season on himself and defender @entity30			1
in charge for now : @entity1 is still @entity5 manager after a dramatic u-turn from owner @entity19 tough start : under @entity1 @entity5 have lost three of their opening four @entity28 fixtures the @entity38 - who infamously sacked and reinstated @entity40 inside a mad 24 hours back in february - decided that @entity30 was at fault for getting sent off in the 4 - 1 loss at @entity43 and that he himself had to shoulder responsibility for not giving @entity12 enough players			1
that earned former @entity47 boss @entity1 an unexpected reprieve , but he insisted on tuesday that he had never been aware that he was on the verge of losing his job anyway			2
' i ca n't even comment on things i have read , what people have said or reportedly said			2
i had a calm , two - hour conversation with the president on sunday , we spoke about the game , the defining moment of the game , ' he said			2
' we talked through players needed and everything and so it was n't even addressed			2
it is what it is , i 'm here , coaching , i love my role , my players and i am getting a lot out of them			0
u-turn : @entity5 owner @entity19 ( right ) has earned a reputation as a ' manager eater ' at @entity76 ' i run my life by controlling the controllables			1
i will manage the game when it 's being played , coach my players and anything outside of that is out of my hands			0
' i 'm just a hard - working guy who loves his job and that 's what i will continue to do			2
' with @entity47 the only club on his managerial resume , @entity1 was a surprise appointment when @entity19 unveiled him after being tipped off about the 56 - year - old by someone he claims he can not remember			1
as such , and with @entity19 earning a reputation as the ' manager eater ' after going through 36 managers in 20 years at @entity76 , few gave @entity12 as much time as he has already had - at present 68 days			1
fond memories : @entity5 reached the semi-final of the @entity9 in 2001 , losing to @entity99 he says , though , that despite the sideshow about his future , he is determined to be a part of what @entity19 is trying to build at @entity105			1
' when i have a conversation with the president and we talk about the club and the way forward and getting players in , that makes me happy , ' he added			0
' it shows me there 's a future for everybody			0
it shows me that the president , however he is portrayed , is unbelievably passionate about this football club			0
i am not just saying it , i mean it			0
' this guy wants @entity5 to be in the @entity9 , he does			1
i believe over time that will happen			0
i think it 's inevitable			0
the timescale i do n't know , i want to be part of that journey , a big part of that journey			0
' i am going to fight tooth and nail to be here for as long as i can , to be as successful as i can			0
