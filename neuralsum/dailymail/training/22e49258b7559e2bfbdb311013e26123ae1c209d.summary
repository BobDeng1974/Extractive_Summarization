by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 15:43 est , 4 may 2013 updated : 03:38 est , 6 may 2013 a grieving widow has described how her terminally ill husband was failed by the new @entity5 helpline in the last hours of his life			1
@entity7 was trying to get a nurse to administer pain relief to her 53 - year - old husband @entity10 , who was dying of prostate cancer			1
she said she was on the phone to a female call centre worker for nearly an hour , but the employee was apparently unable to summon any of the local district nurses as they were not answering their phones			0
he died later that day devastating : mrs @entity7 is pictured with her husband @entity22 , who died from cancer last week mrs @entity7 , 36 , who has two sons , said : ‘ the horrible thing is , i should have been sitting next to him holding his hand , reassuring him help was on the way , and i could n’t because i was on the phone frantically trying to get somebody to help him			1
‘ it was absolutely awful			0
i do n’t know whether that made his anxiety levels worse or not , but it certainly did n’t help him			0
’ by chance , mrs @entity7 spotted a district nurse going to a nearby care home for adults with learning disabilities			1
she ran into the street and was able to persuade the nurse to administer the medication to her husband			1
upsetting : mrs @entity7 is now left with the feeling that her husband 's anxiety levels in his final hours may have worsened because of the stress caused by her unsuccessful attempt to get a nurse to visit he died hours later last wednesday at his home in @entity57 , @entity58			1
mrs @entity7 ’s account comes days after @entity63 , the new body in charge of running the health service , launched an urgent review of the 111 helpline			1
it has replaced @entity67 and @entity68 out - of - hours numbers and is meant to make it easier for patients to get medical advice , especially at evenings and weekends			2
but it has struggled to cope with high volumes of calls and there have been reports of critically - ill patients waiting for as long as 11 hours to speak to a nurse			1
mr @entity81 , who ran a taxi firm with his wife , had begun suffering from violent spasms and although mrs @entity7 had the necessary medication , it could only be administered via syringe by a nurse			1
@entity90 departments are braced for a surge of patients over the bank holiday as a result of flaws with 111 telling @entity99 about her ordeal with the 111 call centre , she said : ‘ initially they phoned the nursing team and they would n’t answer their phone			2
nobody would answer the phone , they could n’t get hold of anybody			0
‘ i was on the phone while she [ the call centre operator ] kept coming backwards and forwards , “ i ’m trying this , i ’m trying that , i ’m trying the other ” and she just could n’t get hold of anybody			0
’ although mrs @entity7 does not in any way blame @entity5 111 for her husband ’s death , she believes it could have been more peaceful had a nurse come more quickly			1
since the 111 system was introduced earlier this year , many hospital @entity90 units have been overwhelmed with patients who have abandoned the helpline or have been given the wrong advice			2
at least three people have died as a result of flaws in the system , while the real figures are thought to be higher nursing leaders say that waiting times of 12 hours are now routine and with some units so overcrowded that patients are being put on trolleys in cupboards			1
this weekend hospitals have been bracing themselves to be even busier than usual			2
many have recruited extra doctors and nurses to work or have put in place contingency plans which would see temporary wards used for additional patients			0
last week figures obtained by @entity145 revealed that the helpline was investigating 22 incidents involving possible poor care , including three deaths			0
the 111 system is run by private gp out of hours firms , @entity67 or ambulance services in different areas of the country			2
@entity63 has pledged to fine these organisations if they are found to be failing to run the helpline properly			0
a spokesman for the nhs 111 service in @entity58 said : ‘ this is a very sad case and our sympathy goes out to the family			0
‘ we take the responsibility for the safety and well - being of our patients extremely seriously			0
‘ when a concern such as this is raised about the @entity5 service we undertake an incident review involving experienced clinical staff			2
this allows us to identify clear actions so that lessons can be learned and acted on quickly and thoroughly			0
‘ we would urge the family to contact us directly so that we can discuss this case further with them			0

@entity7 's husband @entity22 was in pain and dying of cancer
she called @entity5 111 to try and get nurse to visit and administer pain relief
but nurse never came and her husband died in pain hours later
three patients may have died *due* to failings in system
hospitals have seen a rise in patients with *non-urgent* conditions
they were sent by the staff of 111 , many of whom are *unqualified*
