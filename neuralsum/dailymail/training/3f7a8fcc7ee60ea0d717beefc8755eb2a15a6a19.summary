the edgy images and fashion - forward styling would n't look out of place in a copy of @entity14			0
but die - hard fans need n't worry , the so - hot - it - hurts fashion still comes at purse - friendly prices			0
darkly glamorous : the punk - meets - highlander collection includes lashings of tartan and spiky details luxe : elegant baroque print brings this simple dress up to date while black lace ( right ) is a huge trend the moody low - lit images show the brand 's darkly sexy vision for autumn , complete with lashings of tartan , in a combination it describes as ' @entity35			1
' and while the photography has gone up a class or two in recent seasons , prices certainly have n't with bargains galore , including a stylish pair of £ 12 cobalt trousers and a chunky gold pyramid ring for just £ 1.50			2
elsewhere , there 's plenty of lace , a huge trend for autumn , as well as discreet sheer panels , a soupcon of faux leather and the odd peekaboo insert			2
for those who plumped for goth rather than punk during their teens , there 's a surfeit of crushed velvet , including on punky crop tops , studded heavy boots and glam rock bomber jackets dusted with gold sequins			0
other stand out pieces include a £ 13 baroque inspired midi dress in a rich ruby red , and a pair of @entity70 sequinned gold shorts for just £ 14			1
@entity72 jewels : the new range includes plenty of accessories including eye - catching necklaces such as this gothic : a neat black jumpsuit has a discreet peekaboo detail while crushed velvet ups the vamp factor dressing down : weekend - wear retained a punky edge softened with cute @entity87 motifs bargain : these striking cobalt blue trousers cost just £ 12 while sequins add glamour to this bomber jacket in menswear , the @entity93 also proved influential , although it was crofters rather than clansmen providing the inspiration for the boys			1
@entity101 jumpers , complete with prints that would have made @entity103 proud , muted yellow beanies and chunky cord shirts all took centre stage			0
formal wear also has a similarly @entity93 feel , with tartan splashed across everything from suits to knits paired with heavy velvet smoking jackets			1
there 's even a £ 28 ' value tux ' , although men in the market for a budget party outfit will also have to splash out extra for a shirt			2
@entity120 featured also heavily , with a chunky cord - collared denim jacket , billed by the brand as a seasonal must - have , coming in at just £ 23 , while jeans , in a range of different washes , cost £ 10 a pair			1
for those in search of something a bit more light - hearted , the brand took @entity134 as its inspiration for print , splashing @entity138 's iconic rodent across everything from polo shirts to drop - crotch joggers			0
cosy : menswear was heavy on the @entity93 motifs , including classic tartan and @entity148 knits @entity149 : vintage prints , tweed and tartan are all @entity154 - inspired favourites that featured in the collection			1

@entity149 inspired collection includes plenty of tartan
mixed with studs and spikes to create ' @entity35 '
menswear also has a strong @entity93 influence and includes a £ 23 tux
