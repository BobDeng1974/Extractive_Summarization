around 40 per cent of a typical public toilet is contaminated by bacteria and viruses , with just one germ multiplying eight million times in eight hours			0
but a new hand dryer claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of this potentially deadly bacteria quickly and effectively			1
called the @entity8 , it uses a technology known as ' uv plasma ' to blitz all the dangerous airborne molecules inside a room			1
there she blows : a new hand dryer called @entity8 ( pictured ) claims to be the first to kill up to 99 per cent of potentially deadly germs			1
it uses a form of uv light to blitz all the bacteria inside a room the technology is already used in ambulances and care homes to kill infections , but in the form of a hand dryer can tackle unsanitary conditions in bathrooms			1
the device uses technology discovered in the 1920s , called dual wave @entity35 light			1
this is a form of uv light and is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks			0
the device makes use of two wavelengths to kill the viruses			0
a lamp in the hand dryer creates a type of oxygen molecule called oxygen radicals			2
such molecules are found naturally and are nature ’s way of cleaning			0
@entity54 is blasted from the dryer and destroys the germs			0
this can eradicate airborne infections such as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 it can eradicate airborne infections that lurk in toilets such as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , and inventor @entity66 said the dryer could also benefit schools and offices			1
the unit costs just under £ 500 ( $ 740 )			1
it contains a ' @entity35 plasma technology ' unit that silently destroys bacteria in a room ‘ every second of every day ’			1
mr @entity66 told @entity77 that the device uses technology discovered in the 1920s , called dual wave @entity35 light			2
this is a form of uv light which is already used in hospitals and to purify water in fish tanks , for example			0

@entity105 slayer : the hand dryer can eradicate airborne infections that lurk in toilets such as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( a scanning micrscope image is shown ) and @entity110 @entity66 told @entity77 the dryer could benefit schools , offices , hospitals and care homes mr @entity66 explained that inside buildings there are fewer self - cleaning molecules than outdoors , which helps create the perfect environment for germs to breed			1
he said @entity8 's technology is harmless to humans and that the dryer produces lower levels of radicals than are found outside			2
‘ bringing them inside can kill germs and bugs that are not around outside , ’ he continued			2
there is an added bonus of the device eradicating unpleasant smells too , as well as any mould			0
the unit , which costs just under £ 500 ( $ 740 ) , contains a @entity35 plasma technology unit that silently destroys bacteria in a room ‘ every second of every day , to eradicate smells and sanitise surfaces ( illustrated above )			1

@entity8 claims to be the first hand dryer to kill germs and sanitise surfaces
it uses ' @entity35 plasma technology ' to silently destroy bacteria in a room
can eradicate smells and germs such as @entity59 , *e-coli* and @entity61
makers say £ 500 ( $ 740 ) device could benefit schools , offices and hospitals
