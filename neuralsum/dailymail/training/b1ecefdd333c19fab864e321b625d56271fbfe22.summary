' but we have no explanation from the others			0
' earlier , the judge threw out an attempt by mr @entity121 to have today 's hearing adjourned indefinitely until the situation had been resolved			1
the barrister earlier argued the court needed to hear the ' extent to which there is fault on behalf of the sureties			0
' he continued : ' the extent to which there is fault is open for debate			0
the purpose of this jurisdiction is not to punish - sureties themselves may often be blameless - but simply it 's a power of the court to ensure a person on bail attends			2
' mr @entity121 said there was ' no evidence any of the sureties are to blame for mr @entity0 's failure to surrender			0
bail : assange in the grounds of the @entity65 home of @entity62 which he offered as a bail address ' his decision was entirely unforeseeable , ' he said			2
' it was an extraordinary thing to do			0
nobody could reasonably have foreseen that 's what he would do			0
' the anxiety was not that he would take the steps that he did but that he might abscond in the conventional sense , or go into hiding			0
' the police were put in an impossible position - although they knew exactly where he was , and although they knew he had breached his conditions of bail , they were essentially powerless to act			1
supporter : @entity69 @entity68 , 53 , the model and actress turned environmental campaigner , offered £ 10,000 ' short of persuading mr @entity0 to abandon the course he had embarked upon , the sureties were in the same position			2

asked by mr @entity121 why he had not arrested @entity0 , he replied : ' police officers do not go storming into an embassy			0
i do not go into an embassy uninvited			0
' the officer said he had sent a letter demanding @entity0 surrender to police custody to his bail address , his solicitors , and to the embassy , but the @entity11 founder had refused			1
when he sought asylum @entity0 was subject to bail conditions of living and sleeping each night at ms @entity61 home in @entity195 , report each day to a police station , and adhere to an electronically tagged curfew between 10pm and 8am			1
the 41 - year - old @entity198 has been holed - up in the @entity200 embassy for 12 weeks today and faces immediate arrest if he leaves as the foreign secretary has refused to ensure him safe passage out of the country			0
