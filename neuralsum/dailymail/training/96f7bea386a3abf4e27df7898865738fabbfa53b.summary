by @entity0 3.7 million year old soil found deep in a martian crater has given researchers a tantalising clue that life could still exist on the red planet			2
recent images from @entity8 from the impact @entity10 reveal @entity12 - like soil profiles with cracked surfaces similar to those in @entity15 and @entity17 's @entity16 , a new paper reveals			1
chemical analysis shows a structure similar to soil containing microbes on @entity12 - with one expert proclaiming the new research shows ' there is a real possibility that there is or was life on @entity29			1
@entity38 of the @entity39 , who was not involved in the research , said the potential discovery of these fossilized soils in the @entity10 dramatically increases the possibility that @entity29 has microbes			2
' there is a real possibility that there is or was life on @entity29 , ' he wrote			2
@entity51 of the @entity52 in @entity53 has speculated that life is more likely to have originated on a soil planet like @entity29 than a water planet like @entity12			1
in an email , @entity51 wrote that @entity59 's paper ' shows not only soils that might be direct products of an early @entity29 life , but also the wet - dry cycles that many models require for the emergence of life			1
@entity66 geologist @entity59 made the discovery based on images and data captured by the rover curiosity			1
the research adds to the growing body of evidence that microbial life once existed on the red planet			2
his analyses appear in a paper placed online this week by the journal @entity80			0
@entity59 , the paper 's lone author , studied mineral and chemical data published by researchers closely tied with the @entity8 mission			2
' the pictures were the first clue , but then all the data really nailed it , ' @entity59 said			0
' the key to this discovery has been the superb chemical and mineral analytical capability of the @entity8 , which is an order of magnitude improvement over earlier generations of rovers			0
' the new data show clear chemical weathering trends , and clay accumulation at the expense of the mineral olivine , as expected in soils on @entity12			1
' @entity103 depletion within the profiles is especially tantalizing , because it attributed to microbial activity on @entity12			1
' the ancient soils , he said , do not prove that @entity29 once contained life , but they do add to growing evidence that an early wetter and warmer @entity29 was more habitable than the planet has been in the past 3 billion years			0
@entity111 : researchers say soil on @entity29 has a similar chemical composition to the area curiosity rover is now exploring topographically higher and geologically younger layers within the crater , where the soils appear less conducive to life			1
for a record of older life and soils on @entity29 , @entity59 said , new missions will be needed to explore older and more clayey terrains			0
surface cracks in the deeply buried soils suggest typical soil clods			0
vesicular hollows , or rounded holes , and sulfate concentrations , he said , are both features of desert soils on @entity12			1
' none of these features is seen in younger surface soils of @entity29 , ' @entity59 said			0
' the exploration of @entity29 , like that of other planetary bodies , commonly turns up unexpected discoveries , but it is equally unexpected to discover such familiar ground			0
' the newly discovered soils provide more benign and habitable soil conditions than known before on @entity29			0
their dating to 3.7 billion years ago , he noted , puts them into a time of transition from ' an early benign water cycle on @entity29 to the acidic and arid @entity29 of today			0
' life on @entity12 is believed to have emerged and began diversifying about 3.5 billion years ago , but some scientists have theorized that potential evidence that might take life on @entity12 farther back was destroyed by plate tectonics , which did not occur on @entity29			1

images from curiosity show cracked surfaces similar to those in @entity15 and @entity17 's @entity16
analysis shows @entity103 depletion which on @entity12 is attributed to microbial activity
