@entity0 claims : psychologist @entity1 , a professor at the @entity2 , says that research claiming that children who take music lessons perform better academically is misleading it is just one of the ways in which ambitious parents try to give their children an edge at school			1
but making a child learn a musical instrument to boost their academic achievement is a waste of money , according to scientists			0
although research has shown that youngsters who take music lessons are more likely to be top of their class , a psychologist claims this link is misleading			2
instead , improved academic performance may be because brighter children from privileged backgrounds are more likely to learn an instrument , rather than music classes helping to boost their intelligence			1
‘ music may change you a bit , but it ’s also the case that different children take music lessons , ’ said professor @entity1 of the @entity2 , who added that parents ’ education was the most influential factor on musicality			1
he told the @entity47 annual conference in @entity48 : ‘ children who take music lessons come from families with higher incomes , they come from families with more educated parents , they also do more extra-curricular activities , they have higher iqs , and they do better at school			2
’ in tests on 167 children who played piano or other instruments , they found their answer to personality tests could predict how likely it was for them to continue their music lessons			1
those who were more outgoing and conscientious were more likely to continue to play			0
although children who took music lessons did better at school , when the researchers adjusted the results to take into account their social background , there was no link to increased intelligence			0
instead , the research suggested upbringing and background played a crucial role			0
asked if so - called helicopter parents were wasting their money sending their children to music lessons in the belief they could boost their school results , professor @entity1 agreed			1
‘ you can explain almost all of the data that are out there by saying that high - functioning kids take music lessons , ’ he added			0
but @entity92 from the @entity93 , @entity94 , said : ‘ there are benefits to having a society where more people are engaged with the arts , so even if music instruction does n’t make you a better mathematician or a better athlete , even if it only gives you the enjoyment of music , i think that is a good end in and of itself			0
’ clever : professor @entity1 says that brighter pupils are naturally more likely to take music lessons			2

psychologist @entity1 tested 167 children who play instruments
he claims brighter children are more likely to take music lessons
his *findings* *challenge* the idea that music lessons aid academic performance
