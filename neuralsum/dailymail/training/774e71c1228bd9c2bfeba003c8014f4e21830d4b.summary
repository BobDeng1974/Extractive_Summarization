by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 17:13 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 11:48 est , 12 march 2014 denial : @entity5 ceo @entity4 will now supply 7 - year - old cancer sufferer @entity6 with the life - saving anti-viral drug he needs the ceo of the drug company that had been refusing to supply lifesaving medication to a seven - year - old cancer survivor from @entity13 has caved into public pressure and said the boy will now get it			1
@entity5 chief @entity17 announced on tuesday night that his firm will begin a pilot trial for the drug on wednesday - with @entity6 the program 's first patient			1
the stunning reversal comes after @entity4 faced huge criticism for denying the @entity26 boy the medication brincidofovir to fight off an infection he developed after a bone marrow transplant			1
indeed at one point , @entity4 was accused of hanging up the phone to a charity that offered up the $ 50,000 needed to buy it for the child			2
in a statement , @entity4 said that after much careful consideration @entity5 would offer @entity6 the medicine			1
' this 20 - patient open - label study underscores @entity5 's mission to develop innovative antiviral therapies in areas of high unmet need -- for everyone , ' @entity4 said according to @entity44			1
' being unable to fulfill requests for compassionate use is excruciating , and not a decision any one of us ever wants to have to make			0
' it is essential that each individual in a health crisis be treated with equal gravity and value , a principle we have upheld by pursuing further clinical study of brincidofovir that will inform its use in adenovirus and other serious @entity60 viral infections			0
' i spoke to mr. @entity4 yesterday by phone			2
i told him that we had the $ 50,000 that i thought he was claiming he needed to supply the drug , ' @entity67 , vice chair of the @entity68 , said on tuesday morning 's @entity74			0
' he then told me it is n’t about money			0
he told me it ’s all about ethics			0
i said , ‘ fine , tell me why you will not give it to this little boy			0
' if he does not get the drug , he will die this week , i ’m told			0
he said he can not make an exception			0
' @entity67 asked @entity4 what he would do if @entity6 was his child or grandchild , but @entity67 said @entity4 refused to answer this question and then hung up the phone			1
' as a result , it appears the final plea is to the board of directors at @entity5 … i ask the board to close their eyes , and as you close your eyes , assume there ’s a little boy lying in a hospital bed who says to his father , ‘ @entity100 , am i going to die ? and if i ’m going to die , who will take care of me in heaven ? ’ ' @entity67 said to @entity74			2
fighter : seven - year - old @entity6 has survived four bouts of kidney cancer , heart failure and a bone marrow transplant ' and then i want you to assume that this little boy is your child or grandchild			1
and members of the board of directors , i have no doubt how you would respond to that			0
' the drug that will save @entity6 's life has not been approved by the @entity117 , but has previously been administered to hundreds of other patients under a prior ' compassionate use ' allowance			1
' as we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials , we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning @entity117 approval , ' @entity4 said yesterday			1
previously @entity4 said that saying yes to @entity6 would mean saying yes to many more patients , draining the company 's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given @entity117 approval and help many more future patients			1
however , the company received $ 72 million in federal funding to develop @entity69			1
before the good news , @entity6 's mother , @entity137 , said the situation was devastating , especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live			2
' there ’s no good excuse for us , ' she said			0
' there ’s nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking			0
we ’re begging them to give it to us			0
' mother : @entity137 appeared on @entity74 , saying she was infuriated that she was not sitting by her son 's side and holding his hand , but had to campaign so that he could get the medicine he needs family first : @entity137 ( with her children - son @entity6 is second from left ) successfully campaigned for her son to get the medicine he needs @entity6 was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007			2
since then , he has battled the disease four times			0
he had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in november of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments			1
in january of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at @entity173 's @entity172 in @entity174			1
following the successful surgery he developed adenovirus , an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems			0
' normally , @entity6 ’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free , ' @entity6 wrote on her son ’s @entity183 page			2
' the challenge is his immune system ca n’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the new bone marrow cells			1
so to keep the body from killing the new cells , they have to suppress the immune system , thus creating ideal conditions for adenovirus to advance			0
' @entity69 has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks , reports @entity74			1
deadly virus : @entity6 is in hospital battling a virus that could claim his life , but will now get the life - saving drug he needs in his hands : @entity17 , ceo of @entity204 , previously claimed the company no longer had a ' compassionate use ' program @entity6 's doctors also contacted @entity204 requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug			1
' i feel that it ’s just an excuse and we need them to totally change their stance , not only for us but for hundreds or even thousands of people that need [ this drug ] , ' @entity6 told @entity74 before tuesdays good news			1
. ' … to me , [ it ’s ] almost a crime to not make it available to everyone who needs it			0
' @entity137 has launched a campaign to save her son , and says she will not stop until @entity6 gets the medicine , even though the fight is stealing precious moments she could be spending with her son			2
' i want to be by his bedside , holding his hand , telling him , ' it ’s going to be okay , ' but because of this unwillingness to release this drug , i have to leave him and come talk to you and it infuriates me , ' @entity6 told @entity74			2
prior to his change of heart @entity17 said that even a visit to see @entity6 at @entity173 would not change his mind about letting the child have the medicine			1
@entity137 told @entity74 and friends what @entity4 would see if he visited @entity6 's bedside			1
curable : @entity6 is suffering from a curable virus that 's preying on him because of his compromised immune system a chance to live : the little boy has been in and out of hospital for much of his short life , never having a chance to do the things other little boys get to ' he would see a frail little boy who has a very weak voice and has a hard time staying awake because he ’s in so much pain , ' she said			2
' it ’s horrible for us as parents to see , because he ’s a vibrant , strong little boy , and even though he is frail , he has a very strong will about him			0
but things just keep stacking against him , and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery			0
' @entity4 had told @entity74 that seeing @entity6 in this state would not change his mind			2
' we have have great compassion for this family , ' @entity4 says			0
' but this is not just about a single boy			0
