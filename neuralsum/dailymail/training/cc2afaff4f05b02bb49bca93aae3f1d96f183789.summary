attack : energy secretary @entity1 accuses climate change sceptics of being ' blinkered ' emergy secretary @entity1 last night launched an attack on ‘ dangerous and destructive ’ climate change sceptics			1
the @entity5 cabinet minister accused ‘ publicity - seeking ’ critics of ‘ selectively misreading ’ the evidence so we can ‘ all relax and burn all the dirty fuel we want without a care ’			1
in a speech at @entity14 ’s @entity13 , he said they had ignored a recent survey that suggests 97 per cent of experts agree on the human link to global warming			2
‘ just three per cent question man ’s contribution			2
three per cent , ’ he said			2
‘ let me quantify that for you			0
if this was a general election vote , 97 per cent of the vote would generate 630 mps , the three per cent just 20 ... ’ he added : ‘ to coin a phrase , “ it ’s the science , stupid ”			0
’ mr @entity1 , who said it was vital for @entity31 to lead the world by cutting its carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050 , also blamed the @entity34 for giving an ‘ uncritical ’ platform to global warming naysayers			1
‘ this is not the serious science of challenging , checking and probing			0
this is destructive and loudly clamouring scepticism born of vested interest , nimbyism , publicity - seeking contraversialism or sheer blinkered , dogmatic , political bloody - mindedness , ’ he added			0
he said those questioning climate targets were ‘ absolutely wrong and really quite dangerous ’			1
‘ the science tells us we can not afford to relax , let up or wait for a miracle , ’ he added			0
green energy : mr @entity1 claims people who deny the existence of climate change use scientific uncertainty to question all investment in renewable energy schemes @entity56 : @entity58 mp @entity57 mp , chairman of the @entity59 , wants to write tougher targets for 2030 into the @entity61 environmental policy is a major faultline between the coalition parties , with the conservatives against onshore wind turbines and green regulations that they claim will harm businesses			1
former conservative minister @entity70 said the claim that scientists are united in the belief that global warming is driven by human activity ‘ simply does not stack up ’			1
‘ the last thing @entity31 needs at a time of rising energy bills is an energy minister who uses dodgy statistics and alarmist rhetoric to justify even more massively flawed green energy policies , ’ he added an energy firm involved in controversial shale gas fracking is sitting on up to 19 times more gas than previously thought			1
@entity86 said there could be up to 172.3 trillion cubic feet ( @entity88 ) of gas in a 300 - square mile area in @entity90 for which it holds licences , rather than its original estimate of @entity93			0
@entity94 , @entity86 ’s chief executive , said only 15 per cent of the gas might be recoverable , but could make the @entity31 less dependent on gas imports for up to 15 years			0
it plans further research into prospective shale gas resources in the @entity99 and the @entity100 in the south of @entity102 .			0

@entity5 minister launches *extraordinary* attack on his *opponents*
claims climate change *deniers* are ' absolutely wrong and dangerous '
he faces pressure for *watering* down emissions targets in @entity61
