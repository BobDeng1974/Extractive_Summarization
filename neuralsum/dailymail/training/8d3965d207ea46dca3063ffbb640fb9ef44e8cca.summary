the @entity1 scientist on the @entity2 who came under fire over wearing a shirt with semi-dressed cartoons while appearing on tv after the @entity8 landing , has apologised			1
dr @entity9 spoke about the @entity11 's mission to land a robot on a comet for the first time in history , while dressed in a colourful bowling shirt featuring scantily clad women			1
soon afterwards , # shirtgate and slightly more humorous # shirtstorm , began trending on @entity20 in response to the @entity23 - born father - of - two			1
' i made a big mistake , ' the 40 - year - old , who has a phd in space plasma physics from @entity38 said			0
' and i have offended many people			0
i 'm very sorry about this			0
' even before the landing , the @entity2 scientist caused a stir on the social network because of his unorthodox appearance , involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet , which he got in january			2
however , the 40 - year - old 's choice of a shirt covered in women in @entity60 and lingerie broke the online science network in ways @entity66 's bare bottom could only dream of			1
many vented their anger on @entity20 , claiming that dr @entity9 's choice of shirt was sexist and particularly inappropriate as science is a field long dominated by men			1
dr @entity9 was comforted by a colleague during a @entity2 project briefing on the @entity11 's @entity33 channel criticised : @entity1 scientist dr @entity9 upset the internet by wearing a shirt covered in semi-naked women after landing a robot on a comet online anger : several commentators claimed that dr @entity9 's choice of shirt was sexist and particularly inappropriate as science is a field long dominated by men hot comet : during an interview about the landing , dr @entity9 branded the comet landing ' the sexiest mission there ’s ever been ' # shirtgate : dr @entity9 , @entity94 , has caused a stir on @entity20 because of his dress sense both men and women blasted dr @entity9 , accusing him of not caring about women in @entity100 ( science , technology , engineering and mathematics )			1
' i do n't care what scientists wear			0
but a shirt featuring women in lingerie is n't appropriate for a broadcast if you care about women in @entity100 , ' astrophysicist @entity108 tweeted			2
she later added in response to a fellow tweeter ; ' you think a shirt like this makes women feel welcome ? i do n't			2
' ' the fact that a scientist of any gender , but especially a man , would think it 's a good idea to wear a shirt covered in naked women while representing a major space agency and a significant research project is appalling ; and clearly , he had no idea that he was engaging in exactly the kind of casual sexism that drives women away from @entity100 , writer @entity121 pointed out on @entity135			1
during an interview about the landing , dr @entity9 had branded the comet landing ' the sexiest mission there ’s ever been			1
' she ’s sexy , but i never said she was easy			0
' before the emergence of # shirtgate , dr @entity9 , a father - of - two and the son of a brick layer , praised on @entity20 for being ' a proper cool scientist ' and ' definitely not boring '			1
one @entity20 user wrote : ' dr @entity9 is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt , sleeve tattoos			1
@entity152 , ' while another said : ' @entity9 causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning			2
' the father - of - two from @entity157 in north east @entity23 now lives in the @entity158 with his wife @entity159 and children @entity161 , 13 and @entity162 , 11			0
dr @entity9 studied at the @entity163 and @entity38 , winning a phd in space plasma physics he has worked at the @entity11 since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013			2
the role was a real change from his previous job , which was studying the physics of the northern lights , @entity168 reported			0
on wednesday 's @entity11 's @entity2 probe released its @entity8 lander to attempt the first ever landing of a spacecraft on the surface of a comet			2
the separation was confirmed at 9.03am gmt , with pictures of @entity8 approaching the comet expected throughout the day before it lands on the surface at 3.30pm gmt. but the success of the mission now hangs in the balance after a thruster on @entity8 was found to be faulty			0
mission controllers say there is a 50 per cent chance the cold thruster positioned on top of the lander will work , and without it , @entity8 will have to rely solely on harpoons to attach to the surface of the comet			0
the cold thruster was designed to push @entity8 closer to the comet			0
the scientist is so positive that the mission to land on the comet will be successful that he has already had the moment permanently etched on his body ( pictured ) to convince his new team of his dedication , dr @entity9 promised that if @entity206 woke up from its hibernation , he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event			1
this video shows the creation of the tattoo @entity2 has chased comet @entity213 – @entity214 through space for more than ten years in what has been described as ' the sexiest , most fantastic mission ever '			0
after a four billion mile ( 6.5 billion km ) journey , it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles ( 30 km ) away from @entity221			0

@entity1 scientist dr @entity9 is the @entity94
he appeared on tv with shirt covered in scantily clad cartoon women
dr @entity9 's shirt began trending on @entity20 with # shirtgate and # shirtstorm
