details of the £ 627.60 payment were released this week by the @entity16 - run council in @entity17			2
pricey production : translating the @entity20 edition of the @entity5 's magazine into @entity3 for one resident cost £ 627.60 a council spokesman confirmed that just one copy of the translated newsletter was printed			1
it immediately sparked anger among other local residents , who received the original newsletter in april and may which was sent to 8,107 council tenants			0
@entity33 , 43 , said today : ‘ how can the council justify spending £ 630 on translating a magazine for just one person ? ' ‘ the magazine is routinely just put in the bin by tenants and the advice in it is usually less than enlightening , so to my mind it is just a total and utter waste of money			0
’ losing their marbles : the @entity5 borough welcome many cultures and interests to their town like the @entity51 in 2006 ( pictured ) but translating for one resident is too much ' @entity52 ' spend : @entity5 residents complained about the translation done by @entity5 as a waste of money for their town ( pictured ) another local @entity58 , 29 , said : ‘ it ’s all very well translating the magazine into another language , but where does it end ? ‘ if i phoned up and said i only spoke @entity63 or @entity64 would they translate the magazine for me ? ’ a council spokesman confirmed that the @entity6 magazine was translated in @entity3 after a request by just one tenant , but said : ‘ it was useful to do this as there was an article about welfare benefit changes			1
‘ the @entity3 translation was for the @entity6 newsletter on the request of the tenant			0
' he said that it was ' unlikely ' that the magazine would be printed in @entity3 in the future but said future decisions to print it in different languages would be taken on a ' case - to - case basis '			0
