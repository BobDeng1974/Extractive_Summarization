@entity0 is on his way to ' mullering ' @entity2 and @entity3 to become @entity5 ’s greatest ever striker			1
if @entity2 nets against @entity6 on friday he will become only the third player in @entity9 history to hit five goals at two @entity11			1
it has previously been done by @entity14 ’s @entity13 in 1970 and 1978 and @entity3 in 2002 and 2006			1
high flyer : @entity0 fails with a spectacular bicycle kick in @entity5 's 1 - 0 win over @entity18 heading to the top ? @entity3 need just one goal to become the outright leading @entity9 scorer leading the way : @entity2 ( centre ) scores for @entity5 against @entity25 at the 1974 @entity9 indeed , at 24 , @entity2 has possibly two @entity11 left in him so could usurp @entity3 , who needs one goal to move clear of @entity27 ’s @entity26 as the most prolific @entity9 finals scorer with 16 goals			1
it will take a lot for the modern @entity2 to beat @entity33 's achievement of 10 goals at the 1970 finals			1
he added four in 1974			0
like @entity2 , @entity0 plays for @entity36 having come through the ranks and is not for sale			2
@entity39 was rejected by former @entity41 boss sir @entity40 four years ago when he first started to emerge as a force in @entity43			1
@entity41 ’s @entity45 scouts identified ' @entity39 ' as a future star but in the end @entity40 opted for @entity48 and @entity49 instead			1
fancy feet : @entity51 's @entity39 is wanted by a host of clubs after an impressive @entity9 so @entity39 moved from @entity43 club @entity54 to @entity56 in @entity57 before moving on to @entity58			1
he has been linked to a £ 40million move to @entity41 but , with injured fellow countryman @entity60 being lined up by @entity61 , he is set to stay for at least another season in @entity6			1
@entity41 allowed @entity63 to leave their academy and join @entity65 after a wage dispute and wo n't pay the £ 60m being quoted to bring him back			2
@entity67 are still considering a move for the 21 - year - old @entity69			0
but he is more likely to move to @entity61 when @entity71 eventually takes over as boss - which may happen next year after he spends a year as boss of @entity61 's feeder club @entity75			1
middle man : @entity63 ( centre ) has impressed in central midfield for @entity6 at the @entity9 that is if @entity80 do n’t push out the boat this summer to sign @entity63 , who is known by his @entity69 team - mates as @entity83 - ' @entity84 '			1
if @entity27 are to beat @entity86 on friday , then keeper @entity85 is likely to be as much their hero as @entity89			0
it seems incredible that at the start of last season @entity85 could n’t get a game in the championship for @entity95			0
indeed he often did n’t make the bench behind much ridiculed former @entity98 keeper @entity97			2
hero : @entity85 saves @entity101 's penalty in @entity27 's win over @entity103 in the last 16 but it was n’t because @entity106 did n’t rate him , it was just about getting him off the books given his £ 90,000 - a - week salary			0
@entity85 is still technically a @entity95 player and the club are still paying around half his wages while he is on loan at @entity114 club @entity112			0
he could return to @entity95 next season but the club hope his displays at this @entity9 will convince somebody to buy him			2
one to watch : it seemed when @entity6 axed @entity121 and then @entity122 was injured they would lack flair from the midfield or the flanks			2
but @entity127 - be honest how many had heard of him before ? - has come to the fore and @entity6 have flourished with goals			1
creative spark : @entity127 has been the driving force for @entity6 going forward he has the been the main creative force of the team - and according to @entity135 stats has teed up eleven chances @entity137 - say : @entity139 boss @entity138 has said @entity98 will never win the @entity9 again			1
he may have a point but may well have led the @entity141 to a solution			0
who is the man who re-invented the @entity139 national team , helped @entity138 on his way , then went over to the @entity18 and turned their national team into a serious force ? @entity149			1
a @entity139 as @entity98 boss			0
warum nichts ? @entity152 moment : @entity155 , according to the stat men , made 15 ' saves ' for the @entity18 against @entity156 - apparently a @entity9 record since such things were first logged in 1966			2
the great wall of @entity18 : @entity155 pulled off a record number of saves for the @entity18 against @entity156 whichever way you want to look at it , @entity155 produced the best all - round keeper display at the finals			0
but @entity169 ’s save from @entity168 ’s header in 1970 surely remains the greatest single save			0
@entity170 @entity27 and @entity5 are odds - on favourites to progress but the odds could be turned on their head			0
@entity89 insists he has the shoulders to carry the weight of the nation , but carrying the @entity27 forward line - which he has done brilliantly so far - could well prove too much against this talented and spirited @entity86 side			0
and in @entity39 , @entity86 have a player who can unlock a well - drilled @entity27 defence			1
a 1 - 1 draw at 90 minutes is 6 - 1			0
@entity86 can then go on to win on penalties			0
@entity6 versus @entity5 , meanwhile , has the making of a modern classic			0
so stick your neck out and trust @entity189 to keep on scoring			0
a 3 - 2 @entity6 win in 90 minutes is 45 - 1			2

if @entity2 scores against @entity6 he will become the third player after @entity3 and @entity13 to score five goals at two @entity11
@entity3 needs one goal to become outright all - time leading @entity9 scorer
@entity41 target @entity39 may stay at @entity58 this summer
@entity61 lining up bid for @entity51 striker @entity60
is @entity149 the man to *rebuild* @entity98 ?
