prince @entity0 today suggested the growing threat of @entity3 independence was more important than the news his wife , the @entity5 , was expecting again			1
the @entity6 said @entity7 , who is suffering acute morning sickness , was ‘ feeling okay ’ after a ‘ tricky few days ’			0
but he added : ‘ it ’s important that we all focus on the big news and the big international and domestic things that are going on at the moment			1
that ’s what my thoughts are at the moment			0
’ the remarks could be seen as a direct @entity21 intervention into the looming independence referendum just days after sources said the @entity24 was ‘ concerned ’ at the surge in support for separation			2
prince @entity0 , opening the @entity28 , this morning urged voters to focus on ' domestic ' news rather than the news that he and his wife were expecting again the @entity6 said his wife was feeling ' okay ' but had been through a ' tricky few days '			1
but he urged people to concentrate on other developments amid growing panic that the ‘ yes ’ to independence campaign had taken the lead just over a week before the referendum , the @entity24 held talks with the @entity41 in @entity42 this weekend			1
the future of the royal family has been a source of debate in the independence campaign , but the ' yes ' camp have insisted that the @entity24 will remain head of state in a future independent @entity3			1
but a poll in the @entity51 found more ‘ yes ’ voters now want to ditch the @entity24 as head of state of an independent @entity3 than want to keep her in place , according to a new poll			1
the @entity57 poll found that 46 per cent of supporters of separation now believe that an independent @entity3 should break its links with the @entity62 royal family			2
a total of 40 per cent believe an independent @entity3 should keep the @entity24 , with 14 per cent undecided			2
among ‘ no ’ voters , the results are very different			0
more than two thirds of ‘ no ’ voters – 69 per cent – believe that an independent @entity3 should keep the @entity24 , with just 18 per cent in favour of a @entity3 republic and 13 per cent undecided			1
the future of the royal family in an independent @entity3 has been thrown into doubt in recent days amid claims that the @entity24 is concerned about future conflicts of interest			0
pollsters today claimed that the @entity21 baby announcement could help tip support back in favour of the union			0
a spokesman for @entity82 told @entity83 : ‘ @entity24 is generally very popular in the @entity62 and so are the young royals like the @entity6 and @entity5 , probably more so than prince @entity85 for example			1
‘ the royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the @entity24 ’s reported concerns and now @entity5 ’s pregnancy will bring that into focus			2
‘ there are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. it wo n’t be just because of the baby , but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result ’			0
there was said to be ‘ great concern ’ at @entity117 over the prospect of separation			1
@entity24 , who is thought to strongly favour the @entity105 , will be in @entity3 on september 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the @entity62			1
pro-union mps said her presence at @entity42 would be a sign of continuity			2
‘ there is a strong anti-monarchy element in the @entity127 , ’ said former defence secretary @entity124			0
‘ you can bet your bottom dollar as soon as they get independence , their next target is going to be @entity3 being a republic			0
’ former defence secretary @entity124 says there is a ' strong anti-monarchy element in the @entity127 ' a @entity57 poll yesterday put support for independence at 51 per cent , with the no camp on 49 per cent			2
the @entity141 campaign has surrendered a 22 - point lead in the space of a month			0
the shock survey came as : @entity127 leader @entity145 , pictured with the @entity24 , who says says he plans to keep her as head of state , but the @entity127 ’s @entity147 is calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after the @entity24 steps down or dies yesterday @entity150 , @entity57 ’s president , said : ‘ in the past four weeks , support for the @entity105 has drained away at an astonishing rate			1
the @entity154 campaign has not just invaded no territory – it has launched a blitzkrieg			0
’ however , a separate poll for the @entity160 campaign by pollsters @entity157 put the @entity162 camp still four points ahead – by 52 per cent to 48 per cent			0
the three main @entity165 parties have previously promised further devolution in the event of a no vote , telling @entity3 voters they can remain in the @entity62 and ‘ have the best of both worlds ’			2
but this week ’s promise of a fixed timetable , an attempt to shift away from the widely - criticised negative messages of the no campaign , echoes a similar package offered to the @entity179 province of @entity180 before an independence referendum in 1995 , that snuffed out a late surge in support for breaking away			2
mr @entity184 also insisted that if @entity3 were to opt for independence then under no circumstances would it be able to use the pound as its currency , as @entity3 ’s first minister @entity145 says he plan to do			1
@entity190 , and his wife @entity191 were campaigning on the streets of his hometown of @entity194 in @entity195 , in a bid to shore up the no vote however , there were growing signs of strains in the cross-party coalition campaigning for @entity3 to remain in the @entity62			1
labour former prime minister mr @entity190 blamed the @entity202 for the narrowing polls , claiming the no camp was finding it difficult because of anger over @entity207 policies including the so - called ‘ bedroom tax ’ and the cut in the 50p top rate of tax			1
dr @entity124 became the most senior @entity165 figure to express concerns about @entity141 , saying : ‘ one of the problems has been that the no campaign has been trying to run a campaign based on logic and reason , while the nationalist campaign is entirely about emotion and sentiment			0
’ mr @entity145 dismissed the offer of a commission to hammer out new powers for @entity227 as a ‘ panicky last - minute measure ’			0
he says he plans to keep the @entity24 as head of state , but the @entity127 ’s @entity147 is calling for a referendum to replace the monarch after the @entity24 steps down or dies			1
chancellor @entity184 , pictured , has announced an 11th hour guarantee to devolve further powers to @entity3 over tax , spending , welfare and a host of other areas mr @entity41 , at @entity42 yesterday with the @entity24 , was expected to reassure her that in the closing days of the campaign he intends to make the ‘ emotional argument ’ about all that @entity242 and @entity3 have achieved together and what ‘ we can continue to achieve ’			1
sources have confirmed that the monarch will continue with her annual holiday at her private estate in the @entity248 , on september 18			0
the @entity249 insisted that the @entity24 was politically neutral , but one well - placed source said : ‘ you do n’t have to be a genius to work out the @entity24 is a unionist			0
is the @entity254 a @entity255 ? ’ a senior royal source was quoted as saying : ‘ @entity24 is a unionist			0
lots of people were telling us that it was going to be ok but there is now a great deal of concern			0
’ a @entity117 spokesman said : ‘ the referendum is a matter for the people of @entity3 : the @entity24 remains strictly neutral on this , as she does on all political issues			1
@entity24 has maintained a close interest in the referendum as she does with all major matters of public debate and is being kept informed by her ministers and officials in the usual way			0

will be in @entity3 at @entity42 on day of the vote as a sign of ' continuity '
