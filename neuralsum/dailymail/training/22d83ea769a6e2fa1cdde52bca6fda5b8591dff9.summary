@entity0 says his @entity3 team will eventually find their scoring form having netted just one goal this term @entity20 ' 21 league goals in the @entity22 last season helped fire @entity3 to @entity4 promotion @entity24 formed part of a potent strike force with @entity20 last season , netting 20 championship goals a lack of firepower has not been helped by injuries to last year 's potent strike pairing of @entity20 and @entity24 but @entity0 insists that a dispassionate analysis of @entity3 's output so far tells a brighter story than the bare facts of their goal drought			1
