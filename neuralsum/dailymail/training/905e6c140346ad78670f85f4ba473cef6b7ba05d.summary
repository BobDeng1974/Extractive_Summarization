' sirloin ' and ' tofu ' have become code words for ' @entity3 ' and ' @entity4 ' in @entity5 , and a former right - wing state legislator assigned liberals the role of pressed bean curd during a conservative convention in @entity11			1
@entity12 , president of the @entity13 until 2005 and now director of the @entity15 – an affiliate of @entity17 – told a crowd estimated at 3,000 that speakers at the three - day session would not be permitted to talk about candidates , parties or elections			1
' @entity3 ' and ' @entity4 ' were four - letter words at the @entity25 , he said			2
instead , attendees should talk about meat and fake meat			0
@entity12 , a senior official at @entity17 and the director of its affiliated @entity15 , told thousands that no one at the @entity32 could talk about elections , candidates or political parties for three days in @entity11 – and maybe longer – grilled steak and sliced bean curd have replaced elephants and donkeys as the preferred political mascots ' i need to let you in on a secret , ' @entity41 said after speeches by gubernatorial candidate @entity46 and rep. @entity47 , who is running neck - and - neck with @entity50 sen. @entity49 in his upset bid			1
' you have probably noticed that as we brought out @entity46 and @entity47 , that something was missing , ' he said			0
' something was not said about them or by them about how they 're spending 2014			0
' ' i can give you the reason why in two words : @entity60			2
' @entity60 is the former @entity61 official at the center of an alleged plot to target conservative nonprofits for their beliefs by subjecting them to intrusive scrutiny and years - long delays when they applied for tax - exempt status			1
her office , the @entity70 , began a push in 2010 to evaluate applications with an eye toward the possibility of partisan political activity that might disqualify groups from that special status under section 501 ( c ) of the tax code			2
' yes , @entity80 enjoys a 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax status , ' @entity81 explained , ' and we 've been advised that the summit needs to stick to issues and ideas , and principles and policies			0
and that at this summit , because we do n't have all the candidates represented , we ca n't talk about anybody being a candidate			1
' ' so we ca n't talk about candidates , ' he said to a mini-chorus of gasps			1
' we ca n't talk about races			2
we ca n't talk about parties , or @entity3 and @entity50			1
' i had the code researched by the best tax lawyer in the country , ' said @entity81			0
' i said , " are we allowed to talk about sirloin and tofu ? " he said , " yes you are "			0
' sirloin power : the @entity25 had the top trending hashtag among tweets in @entity11 on friday , and the eight - most - tweeted in the @entity110 ' so let 's just make this agreement ... if you form a mental association between " @entity3 " and " sirloin , " and between " @entity4 " and " tofu , " and i was to say to you that every time i whiff @entity46 or @entity47 it makes me wan na eat more sirloin and less tofu , you would know what i was talking about , right ? ' @entity81 then introduced @entity122 , a county commissioner running for the job of lieutenant governor			1
@entity122 , he said , was the evening 's ' third helping of sirloin			0
' in a state known for cattlemen , the program 's friday night headliners included other cuts of meat , and no tofu			0
@entity135 sen. @entity134 , @entity137 gov. @entity136 and crowd favorite dr. @entity138 – who has attracted a multimillion - dollar ' draft ' committee urging him to run for president – were on the butcher 's cart			2
@entity144 sen. @entity143 , @entity146 sen. @entity145 and former vice presidential candidate @entity147 will speak saturday			0

@entity17 think - tank *leader* told political convention - goers he ca n't talk about candidates , parties or elections
' i can give you the reason why in two words : @entity60 , ' he said , citing his fear that the @entity61 might *revoke* his group 's tax - exempt status
' sirloin ' and ' tofu ' should be code for ' *republicans* ' and " @entity50 ' instead , he said
@entity25 attracted thousands of right - wingers to @entity11 , @entity5 – mere miles from the @entity172 's *headquarters* and nowhere near @entity173
