one hundred and sixty square feet may not sound like much space for a family of three and their dog - but the @entity5 clan from @entity6 , @entity7 , are ditching their regular rental home in favor of scaled - down living			1
their diminutive home on wheels , which is nearing completion , will hardly leave room to stretch out for @entity5 , 37 , his wife @entity16 , 33 , their eight - year - old daughter , @entity18 , and @entity20 , their 60lbs dog			1
the dwelling , which measures eight feet by twenty feet , features living space , bedrooms , a bathroom and a kitchen , but minimized to the extreme			0
the family has thrown out their beds , tv and any bulky furniture that would not survive the downsizing , according to the @entity52			0
it has cost them just $ 20,000 to build the house , which is nearing completion			0
their kitchen will have space for a shrunken refrigerator and an oven the same size as a microwave			0
@entity16 said she was skeptical at first , but came round to the idea later			2
she said : ' when [ @entity5 ] first brought the idea to me , i said , " you 're totally out of your mind ... nobody lives like that			2
we ca n't do that			0
" but she came round to the idea - and the family is now expected to reap a huge saving from it - with their montly utility bill slashed to just $ 50 and the price of the property itself shrunk dramatically thanks to their own hard work building it			1
full - size : the diminutive house can be dragged behind a pick - up truck and - in theory - will comfortably house three people and a dog lit up : the house still get electricity - but combined utilities are expected to come in at some $ 50 a month in total sweat and toil : after an architect designed it , the @entity5 family was able to build the house from materials themselves			1

@entity5 , his wife @entity16 , their daughter @entity18 , eight , and their dog @entity20 will live in the tiny home on wheels
currently *stationed* in @entity6 , @entity7 , the almost - ready home can just about fit tiny fridge and oven
expected to be a huge money - saver for the family as utility bills will come to just $ 50 a month
