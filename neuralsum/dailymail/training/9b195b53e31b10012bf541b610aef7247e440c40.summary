by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 00:58 est , 17 july 2013 updated : 05:17 est , 17 july 2013 the family of @entity3 - who was found unconscious in a @entity5 motel room four months ago and woke up speaking only @entity6 - have revealed themselves after learning of his whereabouts for the first time on monday			1
even though his driver 's license says he was born in @entity12 and served in the @entity13 from 1971 to 1973 , @entity3 has no memory of his life to date and now answers only to @entity16 and converses in @entity6 to doctors with the help of an interpreter			1
now @entity3 ’s sister has revealed that she did not know whether he was alive or dead and that she has n't seen him for 10 years			1
scroll down for @entity21 amnesia : @entity3 awoke to find he had no memory of his past life to date , could not recognize his own reflection and believed he was @entity6 ' i have n’t talked to him in years			1
he just disappeared , ' @entity27 told @entity28 over the phone from her home in @entity31			2
she said that she had no way to get in touch with the 61 - year - old , even when their mother had died last year , she said			0
' he ’s always been just a wanderer			0
then he ’d come back when he needed some money or something from somebody			0
then he ’d take off again , ' she said			0
@entity3 was overwhelmed by the flood of calls monday , but wanted to thank those who were helping him piece together his story , hospital spokesman @entity41 said			1
former life ; @entity3 served in the @entity13 from 1971 to 1973 ( left ) and was carrying old photographs on him when he was discovered in a @entity5 motel room in february his current persona of @entity50 , clashes with the social security card , passport and veteran 's medical card he was carrying in february and following mental and physical health exams , @entity3 was diagnosed on march 13th with transient global amnesia			1
doctors at @entity58 have theorized that his total memory loss was triggered by some kind of emotional or physical trauma - what exactly that was though , they admit to drawing a blank on			0
' he 's kind of a blank slate , ' said @entity66 , the social worker assigned to track down relatives and help piece his life back together			0
searching on the internet , @entity66 has learned so far that @entity3 was a 3d graphic designer who taught @entity70 in @entity71 for 10 years and then in @entity72 for four			1
she has discovered on a testimonial on the website of a @entity75 in @entity76 , @entity72 , that he left his teaching post one year before his catastrophic memory loss			0
baffling : @entity3 is pictured here with two women - one who is believed to be his wife and a little boy thought to be his son however , every attempt to discover a friend or relative has failed			1
an address on his @entity90 passport for a @entity71 woman believed to be his ex-wife was a dead end - as was all the telephone numbers listed on his cellphone			0
indeed , the @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity6 consulates have turned up no next - of - kind information			1
what is known is that @entity3 flew into @entity5 from @entity99 on february 24th - which was the last day valid on his @entity72 visa			1
@entity66 said that she did not know why he had chosen to fly into @entity102 and even contacted local tennis clubs to see if he was scheduled to play - thinking his tennis rackets might be a clue			0
upon contacting @entity106 in @entity12 , she found that @entity3 's parents were deceased and that his first wife divorced him in 1983 - she could not be contacted			1
it was even thought at one point that @entity3 could have two sisters in @entity112 , but again , that has not been confirmed			1
no recollection : this is one of the photographs which have failed to jog the memory of @entity3 from his amnesia for @entity3 , the sheer frustration and confusion of the whole ordeal is maddening			1
' when i look at the photos , i see my ex-wife and my son ... my mother and grandmother , but i do n't recognize them			2
i do n't know them , ' he said			2
' sometimes it makes me really sad and sometimes it just makes me furious about the whole situation			0
' indeed , to help @entity3 adjust to his new reality , @entity66 has put him in contact with @entity136 's local @entity6 - @entity90 community at the @entity139 's @entity138 lodge in @entity140			1
his friend there , @entity141 , told @entity143 that despite lucid conversations , @entity3 suffers from detachment from reality			2
' all of the events that he talked about , he has never been involved in it ; he always feels that he is looking in , ' @entity141 said to @entity149 relief : @entity3 uses exercise as the only way to concentrate his mind and not think about his memory loss from their talks , @entity141 surmises that he did indeed live in @entity112 in the mid- 1980s , but because he has no strong regional accent she thinks that he learned it late in life or has not used it much during his adult life			2
even the photographs that he carries do not trigger his memory in any way			0
despite the knowledge that he used to be a graphic designer and taught @entity70 as a second language , @entity3 has no memory of how to execute the skills he learned during his life			2
and sadly now , @entity66 - @entity66 is worried that he may not be able to stay in the hospital much longer because , despite his amnesia , he is healthy			0
but , the hospital is also looking for other viable options - ' really try to avoid just him being in the streets			0
' for @entity3 , though , his daily life is a living hell			2
' walk in my shoes for one day , ' he said			0
' you 'll experience the nightmare of a lifetime			0

@entity3 awoke four months ago with no recollection of who he was and speaking in @entity6
now has sister has come forward and revealed that she has n't had any contact with him in ten years
