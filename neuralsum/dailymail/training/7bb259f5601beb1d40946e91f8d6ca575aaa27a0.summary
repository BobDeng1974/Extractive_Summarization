have you ever experienced deeply pleasurable , distinctly non-sexual tingles that begin in the back of your head and spread down throughout your body and limbs , triggered by certain sounds , physical sensations such as someone cutting your hair or even watching someone complete mundane tasks such as diligently filling in paperwork ? if you have , you are experiencing what is being referred to as @entity14 , or @entity14 , or head orgasms , head tingles , ' @entity17 ' , ' @entity19 ' ( attention - induced euphoria )			1
@entity14 is a recently discovered phenomenon , that like so many others , came to light through the internet and now has its own dedicated fan - base , research page and soon , the first scientific study looking into brain patterns of people experiencing @entity14			1
' ' it is often accompanied by a euphoric feeling , and can overwhelm the experiencer of a particularly strong @entity14 event			1
some @entity14 experiencers are triggered from an uncontrolled external stimulus ; other experiencers can control an @entity14 event through conscious thought triggers			1
' a quick @entity54 search for @entity55 turns up thousands of videos			0
most commonly , they are young women , speaking in soft , whispery monotones about nothing in particular			0
@entity60 : @entity14 proponent ' @entity61 ' brushes her hair for hours for the listening pleasure of the @entity14 community one particularly interminable one made by ' @entity61 ' begins with a breathy explanation of what the viewer is about to see : @entity61 brushing her hair while it 's wet			1
then , she plans to dry the hair , and then brush her hair while it 's dry - all for your aural pleasure			2
the video goes for more than an hour and has 32,604 views			0
another , made by @entity76 and called @entity77 of you , features a young woman in a maternal / nursemaid role , caressing the camera , speaking softly to it , and assuring it that it 's going to be ok , and dabbing its fevered brow with a washcloth			0
one might expect such videos to be the object of ridicule , but it 's just the opposite - people seem to let down their guard and let a stranger 's soft whispers or the sound of someone brushing their hair comfort them			1
@entity99 commented on @entity77 of you : ' thank you very much for ﻿ making this ; could n't seem to wind down till i found this , and now i 'm all tingly and warm ... time to crawl into bed and finally sleep			0
i 'll definately [ sic ] be poking around on your channel			0
' @entity107 said , ' this is by far my favorite video ! please do another similar because i could probably recite this due to how many ﻿ times i 've watched it haha			0
i love the wet towel and the tucking in			0
it made me feel so cozy : ) thanks a lot @entity115			0
' comfort : @entity117 at @entity76 dabs her camera 's hot forehead with a a damp washcloth in the immensely popular @entity77 of you video the owner of @entity76 channel , who refers to herself as @entity117 in her videos , is a @entity129 @entity14 enthusiast who has a high standing in the @entity55 community , such as it is			1
she 's made 211 videos , which include ' saleswoman role play - shoe shopping ' , where she pretends to sell you a pair of shoes , ' relaxing chocolate tasting ' and another where she talks - whispers - the viewer through her grandmother 's jewellery collection			2
it 's edge - of - your - seat stuff			2
but again , for the @entity14 community , this stuff is like a drug			1

i had it as a child an nobody understood ... i finally know i 'm not the only ﻿ one			0
' another commenter wrote that 11:40 was his favorite part of the jewelry video - featuring @entity117 scraping her finger over an earring			2
in her videos she refers to herself as @entity117 , but when she spoke to @entity165 , she said her name was @entity167			0
she said some of the subscribers to her videos include soldiers in @entity171 and @entity172			0
' and they share with me how much they struggle with their nightmares that they get , ' she said			0
' and the @entity14 whisper videos , they actually help them fall asleep better , which is amazing because they sometimes say medications do n't work , but these videos work instead			1
' there are also ' unintentional ' @entity14 videos - instructional videos such as someone demonstrating @entity187 bookbinding , making origami or , as many @entity14 experiencers say , the late @entity190 , whose combination of softly spoken words and demonstrating technique seems to push a lot of @entity14 buttons			1
@entity196 : it 's unlikely the maker of this instructional video had any idea it would be a trigger for @entity14 it 's unlikely that @entity55 is a new phenomenon			1
@entity54 , @entity204 and @entity37 have changed the way people communicate and share ideas and information - there 's a forum for everything and our tendency to ' overshare ' online has created diverse interest communities			1
@entity55 is the same - it began in 2009 , a @entity217 group called the @entity218 formed ' in hopes of finding people who experience the same sensation			1
' in 2010 @entity222 started a blog called @entity224 , on which is a timeline of @entity14			1
that same year @entity227 , who founded the site asmr - research.org site , and coined the term @entity55			2
after that point , the timeline becomes crowded with events , media attention and group meetings			0
in september 2012 an @entity14 app was released for @entity237			2
so where to next for the mysterious @entity14 and its devoted community ? after @entity243 took down its @entity14 page because it lacked any peer - reviewed research or even proof , a @entity241 user and @entity242 undergrad @entity247 announced that he plans to perform brain scans to study it for his thesis			1
@entity247 plans to release his preliminary discoveries on @entity14 in the next few months			2
we 're tingling with anticipation .			0

a new phenomenon has been identified as @entity14 , or head orgasms
people with @entity14 experience intense ' head tingles ' that spread around the body triggered by certain sounds and physical effects such as the sound and feeling of a haircut
there has been no peer - reviewed research on the subject , but a huge online @entity14 community has sprung up online
