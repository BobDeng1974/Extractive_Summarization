prime minister @entity0 has admitted that people 's internet search histories and data will also be used to fight crime in @entity5 - not just for anti-terrorism purposes			1
mr @entity0 has revealed that the government has opened discussions with @entity9 around the country to ensure that the ' @entity12 ' policy can be put in place , seeking measures to ensure the digital footprint of all @entity5 is not lost			1
' this is an absolutely vital weapon in the fight against terror and an absolutely vital weapon against crime fighting more generally , ' mr @entity0 said			1
despite the admission it 's now likely to have wider use by authorities , the pm would not be drawn on whether the information kept would be secure			2
' it 's not what you are doing on the internet , it 's the site 's you are visiting , it 's not the content it 's just where you have been			0
' it 's the person you are sending it to , the person sending it , it 's the date and the place it 's posted from			0
' metadata is the information kept by telecommunications companies - such as phone numbers , email addresses and the dates , times , locations and duration of phone calls			1
government officials have begun seeking guarantees from the providers that those details of browsing history will be not be lost			0
' there is some risk , as time goes by , that this information will no longer be kept , ' added mr @entity0			0
the plan would require bi-partisan support			0
the prime minister is now fighting the announcement on two fronts - including claims the @entity79 is no better than the former @entity80 in breaking election promises			1
mr @entity0 said the about - face on the @entity83 was about winning back support from ethnic communities and that the stronger anti-terror laws were now a more pressing issue			1
but civil liberties groups claim the government 's plans are nothing more than ' a smokescreen '			2
@entity92 from the @entity93 of @entity94 said that ' this is just propaganda spin by the prime minister talking up this problem ( terrorist sympathisers ) '			2
' it 's an illogical announcement , nothing more than a deliberate and serious exaggeration , ' mr @entity92 said			0
' there are already sufficient laws in place to deal with anyone caught dealing with extremists and as for metadata being used in ordinary criminal investigations , well this information is already accessible to authorities , without a warrant being required			2
' all these so - called announcements have been nothing more than a smokescreen , over their getting rid of the so - called @entity116 laws			0

data storage will not be reserved for anti-terror purposes
the ' digital footprint ' of all @entity5 will be secured for general crime - fighting
government is in talks with @entity9 to ensure they save the information
civil libertarians say the government is ' using propaganda to *over-state* the extremists problem '
