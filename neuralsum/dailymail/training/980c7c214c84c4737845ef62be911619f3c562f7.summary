@entity0 is today cast as the ‘ @entity2 party ’ which refuses to back opportunities for poorer people which have been enjoyed by the political elite			2
education secretary @entity6 is to use a speech to accuse @entity8 of reacting to the idea of increasing the aspirations of students with the ‘ horror ’ of the @entity13 in the @entity15 drama to the news that a chauffeur wanted to marry his daughter			1
in a surprise reversal of class - based political attacks , mr @entity6 will claim @entity0 believes working class pupils should ‘ stick to their station in life ’ and not enjoy the elite @entity27 education enjoyed by the party ’s leadership			1
labour leader @entity8 's reaction to raising aspirations for working class students is likened to when @entity2 's @entity13 learned his daughter wanted to marry a chauffeur in a speech to the @entity34 tonight , mr @entity6 will defend the government ’s @entity36 measure , which recognised students who secured at least a c grade in @entity40 , @entity41 , two sciences , a language and a humanities subject			1
the measurement , introduced two years ago , had been greeted with ‘ visceral horror ’ from the @entity0 and the unions , he is expected to say			0
‘ how dare anyone - let alone the @entity49 - reveal how many state school students were getting the sort of education that enables the children of the rich to dominate @entity55 life ? ’ the @entity36 inspired opposition ‘ because it revealed how poorly served so many state students were ’ , he will say			2
education secretary @entity6 will accuse @entity0 of being the ' @entity2 party ' refusing to raise the aspirations of working class students mr @entity6 claims the attitude among the @entity0 leadership is like that of the landed gentry in @entity15 ’s landed gentry , who do not believe that the working classes and the servants should enjoy the same privileges that they do			1
he will contrast the privileged education of mr @entity8 , shadow chancellor @entity71 and shadow education secretary @entity72 who all studied @entity73 at @entity27 with the lack of ambition for students from poorer backgrounds			1
education secretary @entity6 will accuse @entity0 of opposing measures designed to increase achievement of poorer pupils and he will draw on the explosive storyline when the @entity13 discovered @entity82 was running away to marry @entity84 chauffeur @entity83			1
‘ at the moment just 16 per cent of students in the state sector secure the @entity36			0
only 23 per cent are even entered for it			0
more than three - quarters of state school students have been denied access to the qualifications which will empower them to choose their own path , ’ he will say			0
‘ but for @entity0 that ’s not only no cause for concern – it ’s a truth which should be suppressed			0
‘ the current leadership of the @entity0 react to the idea that working class students might study the subjects they studied with the same horror that the @entity13 showed when a chauffeur wanted to marry his daughter			1
‘ @entity0 , under their current leadership , want to be the @entity2 party when it comes to educational opportunity			0
‘ they think working class children should stick to the station in life they were born into – they should be happy to be recognised for being good with their hands and not presume to get above themselves			1
’ the @entity15 drama was rocked by the revelation that aristocrat @entity82 had fallen in love with @entity84 chauffeur @entity83 mr @entity6 will say that claims of ‘ rapid and relentless educational improvement ’ under @entity0 which saw gcse results soar have been ‘ shown up as a far more complex narrative of inequality and untapped potential ’			2
he will add : ‘ but instead of using this information to demand that poorer children at last enjoy the education expected by the privileged , far too many on the left attacked the very idea that poor children might aspire to such an entitlement			0
’ @entity0 hit back tonight , insisting there remains widespread opposition to the plans			2
mr @entity72 said : ' @entity6 is clearly rattled by the widespread opposition to his @entity36 exams			2
instead of lecturing others , he should listen to business leaders , entrepreneurs , headteachers and parents who think his plans are backward looking and narrow			0
' we need to get young people ready for a challenging and competitive world of work , not just dwell on the past			0

education secretary accuses @entity0 of opposing @entity36 which aims to raise aspirations
mr @entity6 likens @entity8 to the @entity13 who wants working class people to ' stick to their station in life '
@entity0 says minister is ' rattled ' by opposition to his *reforms*
