@entity0 never knows when he is wrong , and that flaw has cost the @entity3 manager , according to his former midfielder @entity4			1
@entity4 , who was part of @entity0 's team at tuesday night 's opponents @entity8 before joining him at @entity9 in 1997 , won the double under the @entity11 the next year , and has known the @entity3 boss for three decades			1
but as well as praising his former manager 's work ethic , the former @entity14 star , 44 , also questioned @entity0 's stubbornness and inability to switch off			1
@entity0 is preparing to take @entity3 back to his old club @entity8 in the @entity20 @entity4 ( right ) worked with @entity0 at both clubs , but says his former manager has a striking fault ' he 's a workaholic , someone who lives for the job , ' @entity4 told @entity27			1
' he has a passion , almost pathological , for football			0
he almost forgets to live his own life			0
' for 35 years he has coached , i 've know him for nearly 30 , and he has never changed			0
he has another flaw : he does not recognise when he is wrong			0
' @entity4 revealed that , at times of stress , @entity0 can be found walking barefoot around the training ground to get back in touch with nature			1
' he has tics , ' the @entity37 winning midfielder continued			1
for example , when he 's fuming and needs to think , he must walk barefoot in the grass			2
he needs to be in contact with the elements , like in @entity44 ! ' @entity4 signed for the @entity14 in 1997 , alongside @entity45 ( right ) , and won the double under @entity0 the @entity11 celebrate winning the league in 1998 , but @entity4 has said @entity0 can be too stubborn however , the former @entity14 midfielder did praise @entity50 and his work ethic @entity0 's great strength , however , according to @entity4 , is his ability to get the best out of his players by understanding them on a personal level			1

but @entity4 was quick to stress that his compatriot , who has been working back at the club while doing his coaching badges , should not be talked about as @entity0 's successor yet			1
@entity68 , @entity3 's record goalscorer during two spells at the club , has been tipped to succeed @entity0 but @entity4 says @entity68 , who was part of the @entity76 , should not be thought of as a manager yet ' it 's way too early to tell [ if @entity68 can succeed @entity0 ] , ' he told @entity79			1
' we live in a society where fast food is consumed very quickly and we also quickly discard what was consumed			0
for @entity68 , as with @entity84 , he needs time			2
' you do not become a coach just because you pass your degrees			0
it 's like when you become a parent			2
one becomes a function of his children , we adapt , we learn about ourselves			0
so getting the degree is one thing			0
