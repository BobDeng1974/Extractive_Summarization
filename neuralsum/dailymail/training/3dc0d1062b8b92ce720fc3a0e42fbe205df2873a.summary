she made her name writing psychological thrillers , including one that sees a couple struggling with the impact of an affair , but author @entity8 has herself been married for 25 years			1
despite ups and downs , several different jobs and the birth and upbringing of three children , the @entity10 - based writer is happier with her husband than ever			1
so what 's the secret of her marital success ? from spending time alone to keeping the spark alight between the sheets , she reveals how to make a long - term relationship work for you			1
long term love : author @entity8 has enjoyed 25 years of marital bliss - and says you can do the same happily married : author @entity8 has been married for 25 years and with her husband for 31 this year , the @entity30 and i will celebrate our silver wedding anniversary by spending a few days in a luxury hotel in @entity35			1
but 25 years is not the whole story : this august we will have actually been together for 31 – it took us a while to get around to tying the knot			1
we are practically unique among our friends for having such a long relationship			1
it helps , of course , getting together when you are very , very young ( we were aged 19 and 21 ) , but i ’m often asked how we have managed to stay together for so long			1
clearly , the first answer is choose a good ‘ un in the first place			2
but that ’s quite difficult , because when you fall in love , you 're always pretty sure you ’ve picked the right person			2
so take your time to see if it still feels right			1
if the other one starts giving you grief , send them packing			0
once you ’ve established that , how do you keep that love going through all the curve balls life throws at you ? i only have my own experience to go on , but it ’s worked so far , so here ’s how we ’ve stuck together			0
one of the main reasons the @entity30 and i still canoodle is that we have pretty separate , independent lives , which means that we do not rely solely on each other for our happiness			0
that ’s not to say we ’ve always both had fabulous careers outside the home			0
in fact , i spent many years when our oldest two children were little ( they ’re now 24 and 22 ) , looking after them at home and working part time			1
i have had many different careers , in fact , to fit around our children			0
i started off as a theatre director and playwright , became a teacher , did a bit of book - keeping , then i retrained as a graphic designer before turning to writing			1
i ’ve adapted and survived like this because the @entity30 works in theatre and is away a lot			0
i chose to stay at home and earn a regular income while he went off			0
happy : @entity89 and @entity90 ( left ) and @entity91 and @entity92 have been married for 26 years some friends have implied that they think i have sacrificed my career for my husband ’s , but my reply is that i have really enjoyed everything i have done , and every choice has been made gladly			1
i wanted to be there for my children , so that ’s what i did , and i fitted work around them			1
it does n’t make me any less of a feminist			2
it ’s not always been a bed of roses , though : growing up together as we have , we ’ve had serious downs as well as ups – times when we ‘ ve really had to question our relationship and commitment to one another			2
happily for us , the outcome has always been positive , if sometimes hard - won , and the result is that , as we approach middle age , we know we are here by positive choice rather than passive default			2
then there 's the importance of maintaining a physical relationship			2
look away kids , but whatever age you are , sex is important in a long - term relationship			1
desire will come and go , and you have to appreciate that in each other , but i know that if it ’s been a long time – say over a week – we begin to get irritable with one another			1
only one thing is going to smooth things out , and i ’m not talking about a nice cup of tea			0
but i think the main reason we ’re still holding hands is that we share things with each other			0
we do n’t have that big imaginary couples tally book where we owe each other favours : cooking , money , childcare			0
we do what we can and we are generous with one another			0
this probably comes from being pretty much skint for our first 15 years together			2
sometimes i ’d earn more , sometimes he would			0
we only had one bank account between us – well , it was more of a constant overdraft – and we threw all our pennies into the same hole			0
it has continued like that to this day			0
we are both self employed and our income , if slightly better than it was in the past , is still sporadic			0
but whatever and however we earn , everything we own is owned jointly			0
some might say we ’ve been lucky , and i would agree : we are not tied to regular jobs ; we get to travel a lot , both independently and together ; we have three funny , loving children ; and we still love and fancy each other			0
but , they also say that you make your own luck			2
the key to a long , loving marriage ? you ’ve got to work at it - always			1
