by @entity0 published : 05:44 est , 6 march 2014 updated : 05:55 est , 6 march 2014 @entity3 ’s recent spell of wet weather has damaged many people ’s homes but it has also unearthed some archaeological treasures			0
prints that could be 7,000 years old have been uncovered by a tidal surge in @entity10			1
the impressions , some made by animals and others possibly by humans , have been preserved in a newly exposed area of peat bed at @entity18			1
the footprints , some made by animals ( pictured ) and others possibly by humans , have been preserved in a newly exposed area of peat bed at @entity18 , @entity10 it has not yet been revealed which animals made each of the prints discovered			1
however , a similar site nearby , where prints were confirmed to be 7,000 years old , contained comparable prints			1
they were found to have been made by wild boar , large deer and cattle , which are thought to have been similar to the modern @entity36 variety			2
adult and child footprints were also identified at the @entity40 site			1
it is believed the 100metre long bed has been uncovered during the recent tidal surge that hit the east coast of @entity45			1
the find follows the discovery of similar footprints , which have since dated at more than 7,000 years old , at nearby @entity40 in an organised dig that took place last year			1
archaeologist @entity51 found the latest prints on his daily walk along the beach near his home with his dog , although it is not yet certain as to exactly which animals the prints were made by			0
mr @entity51 , who is @entity61 ’s @entity60 , was involved in last year ’s dig and now regularly walks the length of @entity18 to look for new prints			1
at around the time the prints ( pictured ) were thought to be made , mesolithic period hunter - gatherers who had followed migrating animals as they moved around the country , were beginning to form settled communities the new animal prints were found at @entity18 ( pictured ) and similar were discovered at @entity40 ( also pictured ) last year , which included footprints made by adults and a child 7,000 years ago ‘ i have never seen this peat bed until now			1
when i looked more closely you can clearly see lots of footprints along with some large tree trunks , one of which is still attached to its root system , ’ he said			0
‘ my discovery of these latest footprints adds to the picture that has been built up of what life may have been like thousands of years ago on this stretch of the @entity10 coast			1
‘ around the time these prints would have been made , @entity95 period hunter - gatherers who had followed migrating animals as they moved around the country , were beginning to form settled communities			0
’ archaeologist @entity51 found the latest prints ( pictured ) on his daily walk along the beach near his @entity102 home with his dog archaeologist @entity51 ( pictured ) said : ' my discovery of these latest footprints adds to the picture that has been built up of what life may have been like thousands of years ago on this stretch of the @entity92 ' both adult and child prints were identified during the @entity40 dig as well as those of wild boar , large deer and cattle , which are thought to be similar to the modern @entity36 variety			1
radiocarbon dating confirmed that the prints were more than 7,000 years old			2
mr @entity51 said : ‘ it is reasonable to assume that the footprints i discovered may have been made by these same animals - and perhaps humans - around the same time because of their proximity to @entity40			1
it is quite incredible to stand on the beach and look at footprints that may have been left by animals passing this very way perhaps thousands of years ago			0
’ the earliest footprints left by humans outside @entity131 have been found in estuary mud in @entity133 , it was announced last month			0
described as ' the most important discovery on @entity137 shores ' , the 800,000 - year - old footprints were found in @entity138 after being exposed by sea tides			2
scientists believe the footprints are evidence of the earliest known humans in northern @entity144 , previously only revealed through the discovery of animal bones and stone tools			2
the footprint surface was exposed at low tide as heavy seas removed the beach sands to reveal a series of elongated hollows cut into compacted silts			0
of the 50 footprints found , only around twelve were reasonably complete while two showed the toes in detail			0
it is thought that the prints represent a group of at least one or two adult males , at least two adult females or teenagers and three or four children			2
in some cases the heel , arch and even toes could be identified , equating to modern shoes of up to @entity3 size 8			0
the early humans would have looked very much like us , but with much smaller brains , said one expert			0
last month it was announced that 800,000 - year - old footprints were found in @entity133			2
analysis from the @entity178 showed the prints , pictured , were from a range of adult and juvenile foot sizes and that in some cases the heel , arch and even toes could be identified , equating to modern shoes of up to @entity3 size 8			0
the camera lens cap is used for scale			0

animal prints were preserved in a peat bed at @entity18 , @entity10 and were thought to have been uncovered by a tidal surge
there could be human footprints among them
similar impressions were discovered in nearby @entity40 last year and some were confirmed to belong to adults and a child
