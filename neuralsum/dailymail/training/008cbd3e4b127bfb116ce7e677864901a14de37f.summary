by @entity0 @entity1 sang the praises of @entity3 after the @entity5 target showed he still has @entity7 's best interests at heart by sinking @entity9			1
@entity3 recently claimed his six - year stay at @entity7 had been destroyed in an hour - but he needed less time than that to leave @entity9 's defence in pieces at @entity15 and set up a 3 - 1 win for manager @entity1 's first three points in @entity18			1
the @entity9 had led through @entity20 's deflected effort , but @entity21 midfielder @entity3 levelled on the stroke of half - time , curling home after his initial shot was blocked by @entity26			1
@entity7 chairman @entity41 and @entity1 have both been steadfast that @entity3 will not join the list of high - profile departures from @entity44 's			1
after @entity41 gave an interview declaring @entity3 would be kept at the club , even against his wishes , the player took to @entity49 in late july to write : ' 6 years of an amazing journey Â£ @entity51 destroyed in 1 hour ! ! ! ' but @entity3 has started all three league games so far , and @entity1 said on saturday evening : ' i am very pleased with his attitude over the last few weeks			1
' he accepts the situation the way it is			2
if he did n't accept it he would n't reach the level that he did today			0
fine performance : the @entity21 midfielder curls in one of his two goals as @entity7 beat @entity9 3 - 1 attitude : @entity1 has praised @entity3 's attitude and application despite being linked with @entity5 ' i understand his situation			1
if a player gets an offer from a big club i understand that but he is happy now and he accepts the situation - he is a fantastic player			2
' despite former @entity7 boss @entity73 being keen on taking @entity3 to join him at @entity5 , @entity1 is almost certain the 24 - year - old will remain a @entity7 player when the transfer deadline closes on monday night			1
' if it is up to me it is 100 per cent			0
ninety - nine per cent from the club that he will stay , ' he said			2
' it is always difficult when you have a lot of changes in the team and i have to wait until the start of september to know what players i have in the squad			0
but it gives us a good feeling after today			0
' lesson : @entity9 manager @entity94 ( left ) said @entity7 taught his side a lesson during the defeat for @entity9 , it was a disappointing afternoon , a week after a 3 - 1 victory at @entity99			1
a penalty shoot - out defeat to @entity101 saw them knocked out of the @entity103 at their first hurdle and @entity94 's side were not at the races once again as they looked for back - to - back league wins			1
' we were n't good enough , ' @entity94 said			1
' @entity7 taught us a lesson , we were n't sharp enough and did n't retain the ball as well as they did , close down as well as they did and gifted them two goals			1
' as much as they were in control and on top of the game , we 've lost two very stupid goals from set - pieces			2
' new signing : former @entity122 midfielder @entity27 has signed for @entity9 on loan from @entity124 one bright point for @entity9 was the pre-match announcement that they have signed @entity124 midfielder @entity27 on loan			1
the former @entity122 man will spend the remainder of the campaign at @entity15 and @entity94 wants to see the @entity133 international ' kick a few backsides '			2
' i hope he can bring a bit of leadership as well as his quality play , ' @entity94 said			2
' the lads are not opening their mouth enough			0
they all talk about what they should do before the game in the dressing room and in training , but when they go out on the pitch they do n't talk to each other			0
it is clear that their communication is zero			0
' somebody has got to get a grip and open their mouth			0
if it is a short corner get someone out there			0
it is not difficult for someone to look around and organise the team			0
it does n't appear that anyone is analysing what the situation is and not have the desperate defending that we had			0
' having spoken to him he looks a leader to me and kick a few backsides on the field			0
if they are not playing as well as they should do he will get them motivated			0
