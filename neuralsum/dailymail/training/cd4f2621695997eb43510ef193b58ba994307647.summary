a disabled mother has been fined £ 120 for taking her youngest child out of primary school during term time			1
the mother - of - four , who wishes to remain anonymous , suffered a stroke after paying the charge , according to campaign group parents want a @entity8			1
the woman 's three oldest children were given permission to go on vacation by their secondary school , but her youngest child was not allowed			1
despite this , the family went ahead with the holiday , as it was funded by a charity , who could only afford term - time holidays			1
the mother was slapped with the charge when she returned from the trip			2
since the rules , heads have turned down requests for children to skip school for term - time holidays , as well as refusing applications for pupils to attend relatives ' weddings , funerals and even leave on doctor 's advice changes to the law , which came into force on september 1 , mean schools no longer have the discretion to grant 10 days of authorised leave to pupils each year			1
instead , headteachers are being told they should only approve an absence under ' exceptional circumstances '			0
the new rules are aimed at preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education			1
in the year before the new legislation was introduced , the number of parents hit with fines soared by nearly 70 per cent in the past year			0
some 63,837 penalties were issued to parents in the academic year to july 2014 in @entity56 , compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months			0
the new legislation , brought in on september 1 , aims to prevent youngsters missing chunks of their education the move has been criticised by campaigners who claim it is unfair on parents and has no affect on the level of a child 's academic achievement			1
@entity68 mp , @entity68 , is chairman of campaign group parents want a @entity8 , which has collected more than 200,000 signatures from parents who oppose the new rules			1
he told @entity72 : ' the government 's own research says that a small amount of authorised holidays has no negative affect on achievement and may in fact result in better outcomes			0
' the time that parents have to concentrate on their children means that if they do ensure that work is put into academic issues then it can be better for the children			0
' the only benefit to be expected from the new policy is for @entity92 statistics on absence to look different			0
we should concentrate on what is best for the children rather than ticking @entity98 's boxes			0
' he added : ' there are many cases where families are badly impacted by the new rules			0
families should be supported by the government rather than family life made more difficult			2
' mr @entity68 said he would raise the case of the disabled mother with @entity109 , the @entity110			2
a spokesman for the local authority that imposed the penalty charge , said it could not comment on individual cases , but added : ' cases such as this create difficult decisions for head teachers , particularly in the light of changes introduced by national government at the beginning of this year , which dramatically restrict their ability to exercise discretion			0
' if absence is not authorised and parents still take their children out of school then the local authority is obliged to issue a penalty notice			2
' @entity68 mp , @entity68 , is chairman of campaign group parents want a @entity8 , which has collected more than 200,000 signatures from parents who oppose the new rules in one of the most high profile cases , @entity137 , 25 , was cleared at @entity140 last month for keeping her daughter off school for seven days			1
miss @entity137 said she let her daughter have the odd day off to ' keep an eye on her ' as she was recovering from cancer			1
in 2010 , her daughter @entity145 had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys , but recovered after several months of chemotherapy			2
the cancer has not come back but @entity145 remains under the care of @entity152 for regular check - ups			0
between january and march this year miss @entity137 kept @entity145 at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell , instead of sending her to @entity156 , in @entity157 , @entity140			1
she was ordered to pay a £ 120 penalty fine , but was cleared of a criminal act			1
@entity137 , 25 , was cleared at @entity140 last month for keeping her daughter off school for seven days in another case taken up by the campaign group , a five - year - old was refused permission to go with her parents on the family 's first holiday abroad			1
@entity168 and @entity169 from @entity170 , @entity171 , asked @entity172 for leave to take their daughter @entity174 to @entity175 for a week in september			2
@entity169 , a police officer , can only take leave only at authorised times			0
because of his work commitments he was not able to take time off during the six - week holidays			0
the school refused but the family still went			2
' now we are left in limbo wondering whether we will be fined , ' said @entity185			0
' it is not something we would normally do but we took books for her and the trip was educational			0
we went into @entity191 and @entity174 learnt @entity193 words			0
' i feel annoyed because we are good parents and we take school very seriously			0
this is the only family holiday we have ever had abroad			2
' in a separate case , @entity197 and @entity198 , from @entity199 , refused to pay @entity201 a £ 120 fine for taking their three children to the @entity204 to attend a family memorial service			1
he refused to pay a £ 120 fine from his local council and was expected to appear in court where he faced a £ 2,500 fine and a jail term			1
but the council said it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case as the family left to live in the @entity204			0
elsewhere , 41 - year - old salesman @entity215 left his job , so he could take his family away during the school holidays			2
@entity219 fined mr @entity215 £ 120 for taking seven - year - old @entity220 on holiday to @entity222 in june , during the only time he was allowed to take off work			1
he claims he had explained the situation to teachers at @entity226 in @entity219 and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine			0
