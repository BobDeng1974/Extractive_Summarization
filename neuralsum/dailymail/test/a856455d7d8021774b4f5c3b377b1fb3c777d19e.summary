an ingenious @entity1 designer has come up with the ultimate environmentally - friendly way to create stunning household furniture - by letting @entity4 do all the hard work			1
@entity6 grows young trees into specially - designed plastic moulds , pruning and guiding the branches into shape before grafting them together to form ultra-tough joints			2
using this method he 's already created several prototype pieces and has a field in @entity15 where he 's currently tending a crop of 400 tables , chairs and lampshades which he hopes to harvest next year			1
he explains : ' you start by training and pruning young tree branches as they grow over specially made formers			0
' at certain points we then graft them together so that the object grows in to one solid piece - i ’m interested in the way this is like a kind of organic 3d printing that uses air , soil and sunshine as its source material			0
' after it 's grown into the shape we want , we continue to care and nurture the tree as it thickens and matures before harvesting it in the @entity60 and then letting it season and dry			2
' it 's then a matter of planing and finishing to show off the wood and grain inside			2
' furniture farmer : @entity6 with a prototype wooden lampshade grown into shape using his ingenious technique botanical manufacturing : a light shade being grown , left , and as a finished article , right working together with his wife @entity73 , mr @entity6 mainly uses strong , fast - growing willow for his designs but is also experimenting with ash , sycamore , hazel , crab apple , sessile oak and red oak			1
he had the original idea while working as a gardener in @entity84 and making furniture from driftwood in his spare time			0
remembering an old over-grown bonsai tree in his mother 's garden when he was child which resembled a throne , he decided it would be faster to grow furniture directly rather chopping a mature tree into bits			1
as well as avoiding the need for nails , fixings and machinery , the designs should last longer than traditionally - made chairs as they do n't have the weak points around the joins			0
@entity73 , 40 , explains : ' just like a broken bone will be a lot stronger where it heals , the points where the wood is grafted are extremely strong			0
the field in @entity15 where the unusual crop is growing			1
mr @entity6 hopes it will be ready to harvest next year form and function : the technique creates furniture which is not just beautiful to look at but extremely strong too ' it means you do n't have joints which come lose like with a traditionally made chair so they should last a whole lot longer			1
' the first prototypes were grown in @entity73 's mother 's garden before @entity124 persuaded her husband to give up working as a gardener and web designer and focus on the project full time			2
mr @entity6 , who has named his company @entity129 , has already harvested chairs , a table and lampshades and is currently working on more complex designs including a bookshelf and a chest of drawers			1
but it 's not simply a matter of setting up the molds and sitting back and letting the trees grow into shape			1
the technique involves copious amounts of pruning , coppicing and grafting			0
tragedy struck early on when a herd of cows rampaged through the field damaging many of the young trees			2

mr @entity6 hopes to have them on sale in 2017 priced at £ 1,000 and £ 1,500 depending on the size but the @entity159 recovered and weather - permitting they hope to have their first big crop harvested in 2016 and ready for sale in 2017			1
most of the pieces have already been pre-ordered with the chairs selling for £ 2,500 each and the light shades priced between £ 1,000 and £ 1,500			0
mr @entity6 added : ' the whole process takes place over seasons and years - between four and eight years to grow a chair for example			0
' but when you look at how long and how much effort it actually takes us now to go from having no tree to final wooden object then you realise that the craft we ’re a part of developing is not just more cooperative with the natural world ; it has an elegant efficiency all of it own			0
' i ’m only making 50 or so pieces a year but for every 100 trees you grow there are a 1,000 branches you need to care for and 10,000 shoots you have to prune at the right time			2
it ’s an art - form in itself keeping track of everything			0

@entity1 designer prunes and grafts growing trees directly into shape
he 's currently tending a field of 400 tables , chairs and lampshades
mainly using willow but also sycamore , ash , hazel and crab apple
first crop to be harvested next year with furniture ready for sale in 2017
