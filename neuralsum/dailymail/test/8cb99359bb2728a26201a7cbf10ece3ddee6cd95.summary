@entity0 was commentating on @entity2 ’s game against @entity3 when the fire broke out and still struggles to listen to his description of that fatal day			1
here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze			1
it was a day i have often tried to forget , but it was the one i must always remember			1
approaching the 30th anniversary of the @entity2 fire , it was inevitable i would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match i was commentating on for @entity16			1
what i did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident , as @entity21 has done with his book @entity23 , the story of the @entity25			1
the tragic fire at @entity2 's @entity28 stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on may 11 , 1985 @entity21 lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind — any bitterness would be understandable — but from everything i have been told there is n’t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately			1
on the contrary , i remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started			1
detective inspector @entity45 actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire			2
this corroborates what i was told at the time by the coroner			2
he said it was believed the fire had been started by a man , visiting this country from @entity60 , but his name was never revealed			2
without making allegations against the club ’s chairman at the time @entity67 , there is inference by implication in the book — with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased @entity67			0
as members of his own family were seated in the stand that day , and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later , it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson			2
i find it abhorrent that @entity67 ’s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grieving and paying their respects three decades on from the most horrendous day of their lives			0
there is n’t a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy			1
it should also never be forgotten that @entity67 twice saved @entity2 from extinction			0
as son @entity98 said to me : ‘ he put that club above everything else , including family and business			0
’ a memorial at @entity28 pays tribute those who died in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago we all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine			1
i can not bear to watch the footage			0
if i hear my voice describing the tragedy as it unfolded i have to leave the room			0
many of the 54 @entity2 and two @entity3 fans who lost their lives , choked to death with inhalation of fumes			0
the smell was of acrid tar			0
as a @entity123 myself i knew many of those fleeing for their lives , as i attempted to describe the scenes without becoming over-emotional			0
thirty years on we try to forget but we must always remember			0
