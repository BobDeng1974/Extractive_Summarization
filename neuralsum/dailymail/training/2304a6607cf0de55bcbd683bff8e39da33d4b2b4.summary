widow @entity0 , 69 , was fleeced out of £ 20,000 of her life savings by a string of mail scams a grandmother told how she was fleeced out of £ 20,000 of her life savings by a string of mail scams			1
widow @entity0 's name was found on a ' sucker list ' used by fraudsters after a raid on a distribution house from where the letters are sent			1
but before the discovery she had lost tens of thousands of pounds replying to scam letters from lotteries and so - called clairvoyants			1
the trusting grandmother - of - two said she feels like she has been taken for a fool by the ' terrible ' scammers who have deliberately targeted her with up to 20 letters a day			1
the former nanny , 69 , said : ' i must have spent thousands of pounds - it was money i was saving for holidays and for my grandchildren			2
' i would have loved to travel or go on a cruise - but because of these scammers i have n't been able to do any of that			2
' the letters are so cleverly worded and addressed directly to you			0
' they obviously think i am an easy target and used that to their advantage , and then they tell others and they send letters too			0
' i have always thought of myself as a business minded person , as i have worked all of my life , and i have never thought of myself as stupid but i must have been to fall for it			0
' mrs @entity0 - who moved to @entity42 from @entity43 almost 50 years ago - began receiving the abundance of mail when she moved into her current home @entity47 , @entity48 , in 2006			1
and over the nine years since she has forked out as much as £ 20,000 - paying between £ 20 and £ 40 a time to supposed mediums and lottery schemes promising prizes of millions of pounds			1
mrs @entity0 's was one of dozens of names found on a ' suckers list ' when the @entity54 raided a distribution house from where scam mail would be sent			1
@entity58 bosses said the case was an example of con artists using cleverly - worded letters to groom people into handing over their hard - earned cash			2
the widow , whose name was found on a suckers list , receives up to 20 scam letters each day a spokesperson from @entity58 said : ' @entity70 was highlighted to us as being on what they call a ' sucker list '			1
' unfortunately , particularly with elderly , vulnerable people they can be taken in and it can open up the flood gates			0
' these people are effectively groomed			0
a more sinister development is a clairvoyant saying they can see a big money win			0
surprise , surprise , the victim then gets a letter from the lottery			0
' and they personalise letters using their first names - it 's a very vindictive way of earning a living			2
' the 69 - year - old used to reply to every letter she received but after being contacted by @entity58 she has stopped this but despite stopping replying to the letters last year , the grandmother still gets up to half a dozen letters every day as well as several phone calls			1
she said : ' these people normally target people who are elderly or alone or do n't get out much			0
they take advantage of vulnerable people - it is terrible			0
' but if i can stop just one person from doing what i have done , and stop more people from being hoodwinked , i am willing to share my story			0
