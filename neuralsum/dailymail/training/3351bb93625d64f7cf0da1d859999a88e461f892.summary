by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 18 march 2012 updated : 15:32 est , 19 march 2012 after finding their dream home , @entity1 and his family were delighted when their £ 400,000 cash offer was accepted			1
they moved into the four - bedroom property – complete with sauna , swimming pool and games room – straight away , and mr @entity1 set about spending the remaining £ 70,000 of their savings on renovations			1
but after six months of bliss , the family were told they did not own the house after all – and that it was being repossessed			0
distraught : @entity1 and @entity21 with their sons @entity22 and @entity25			1
they lost their home after solicitors handling its sale fled with their money two solicitors handling the sale have fled after failing to pass on the @entity35 ’ money as required			1
one man has been jailed for two and a half years in connection with the scam , while another man and a woman have been released on bail			1
the family are yet to recover any of their cash			2
now penniless and homeless , mr @entity1 , 50 , his wife @entity45 , 36 , and sons @entity22 , 13 , and @entity25 , ten , are staying with mrs @entity21 ’s parents			1
their savings were ‘ the result of 34 years of hard work ’ , mr @entity1 said			1
‘ it has been taken away from us just like that			0
’ mr @entity1 , who runs his own property maintenance and commercial cleaning business , and his wife sold their previous home in august 2010 , giving them enough money to buy a new house mortgage - free			1
they lived in a mobile home while searching for the perfect family property , which they eventually found last year in @entity67 , @entity68			2
‘ it was everything we could have dreamed of , ’ mr @entity1 said			2
‘ it had four bedrooms , a swimming pool , an annexe in the garden with a sauna and a games room for the kids , and it backed on to fields with horses			0
we never thought we would get it because it was on the market for offers around £ 500,000 and we only had £ 400,000			0
dream house : the four bedroom property in @entity67 , @entity68 , where the @entity1 were forced to move out of ‘ but we had cash ready to buy it , and the estate agent came back and said : ' as long as you can complete within ten days , it ’s yours			1
” we transferred the £ 400,000 for the house into our solicitors ’ account , and on completion day they transferred the money into the account of the sellers ’ solicitors			1
‘ that was in august last year			0
where our money went from there , nobody knows			0
’ mr @entity1 said the first sign that something was wrong came in september , when his solicitor had difficulty registering the title deeds with the @entity111			2
‘ eventually it came to light that the money we had paid had disappeared and the two partners of the solicitors ’ firm had fled , ’ mr @entity1 said			1
repossessed : the notice plastered on the family home which has been left penniless after their savings were taken further investigations revealed that the couple selling the property owed £ 542,000 to mortgage firms , meaning the sale should never have been permitted			1
this had been concealed by the sellers ’ solicitors			1
‘ even when we found out what happened , we never thought we would have to give the house back , ’ mrs @entity21 said			0
‘ we thought because we had n’t done anything wrong there would be a way around it – but the more court hearings we attended , the more we realised that was n’t going to happen			0
‘ i will never forget seeing the children sitting on the stairs crying while we were packing when the house was repossessed because they did not want to go			0
’ mr and mrs @entity21 thought the £ 400,000 would be returned to them by the solicitors ’ insurer – but a loophole meant it did not have to pay up if both of the firm ’s partners were fraudulent			0
‘ now our whole future is in the hands of the @entity150 , ’ mr @entity1 said			2
the @entity150 has closed down the offending solicitors ’ firm , which can not be named due to a court order			0
it is still investigating the company , which is thought to have left dozens of other victims out of pocket			0
a spokesman for the regulator said its compensation fund had received ‘ a number of claims relating to the solicitors ’ , and asked for mr @entity1 ’s ‘ continued patience ’			1
@entity165 are also investigating the firm			0
last month , @entity167 pleaded guilty at the @entity168 to two counts of fraud by misrepresentation in relation to setting up a bank account in the name of the solicitors			2
the 28 - year - old , from @entity177 , @entity178 , also pleaded guilty to money laundering			0
he was jailed for two and a half years and warned he could be deported to @entity180			0
