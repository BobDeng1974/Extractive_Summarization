defender @entity0 insists @entity1 will not be changing their style of play to suit the sweltering conditions at this summer ’s @entity5 in @entity6			1
@entity8 ’s side start the tournament against @entity10 in the challenging @entity12 climate of @entity13 , where temperatures are expected to exceed 30 degrees celsius and humidity regularly soars above 75 per cent			2
the players wore extra layers during sessions in @entity20 last week to sweat more and simulate warmer conditions but @entity0 is adamant that come june 14 , @entity1 will not be doing anything differently			1
fighting fit : @entity1 defender @entity23 insists @entity1 are ready for the heat in @entity6 sofa time : @entity26 , @entity0 , @entity27 and @entity28 attend the opening of @entity30 ' we ’ve been wearing about four different layers in training , everyone has been sweating a lot more and that seems to be working - anything that makes us more ready , we ’ll do it , ' the @entity32 defender said			1
' but i think each country - and especially us - will play their normal game			0
' our attacking force is all about pace and running at people and this squad has got that in abundance			0
' we wo n’t be changing our style for the conditions			2
we just want to make sure we ’re ready to play our game			0
' we ’re going to go into each match the same way and if everyone can pull off what they ’ve doing for their clubs , it ’s going to be exciting			0
' @entity8 has put faith in a host of young talents , with just five players on the plane to @entity6 aged 29 or older			1
where in previous tournaments @entity1 have placed their hopes on a number of world - renowned stars , this time it may be up to the likes of @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity72 and @entity73 to carry the @entity1 through			2
taking on some responsibility : @entity75 ( next to @entity76 ) is ready to set an example for @entity1 @entity0 believes being an unknown quantity could turn out to be @entity1 ’s trump card			1
' there ’s so much potential in the squad - there ’s that unknown factor about @entity1 , ' he said			2
' if everything comes together , we can take teams by surprise with our pace and attacking instincts and then who knows how far we can go ? ' i think there ’s that possibility where nobody is sure what @entity1 are about and if players can play to their potential you never know what can happen			1
' @entity1 fulfilling their attacking promise may depend on how bold @entity8 is prepared to be with his tactics and team selection			1
@entity0 , who previously worked under the @entity1 boss as a teenager at @entity106 , is adamant @entity8 has all the qualities needed to get the best out of the young talents at his disposal			1
' he has got that attacking instinct , ' @entity0 said			2
' he ’s bold enough to put those attacking players out on the pitch ; he would n’t have chosen them if he did n’t want to do that			0
' helping hand : @entity1 skipper @entity116 will need his senior players to aid him out in @entity6 next month @entity0 said of the @entity1 manager : ' he talks to the guys one to one a lot - he will talk to everyone as a group and then during sessions he will pull you aside on your own or maybe in groups , whether it be the defenders or midfielders or whatever			1
' he ’s very approachable - i found that from my days at @entity106 and even more now at @entity1			1
' he ’s a guy you can always talk to , if you ever need advice he ’s always there and that ’s important for young players			0
' @entity1 play @entity136 at @entity137 on friday before further warm - up matches against @entity139 and @entity140			0
' i know @entity8 has chosen me mainly for that centre back spot and that ’s my position , ' @entity0 said			1
' i ’m going to be really vying for that place , training hard and staking a claim for that centre - back spot			0
' i can obviously play right - back when needed and this season we ’ve struggled with injuries there so i ’ve stepped in , but i think the manager knows that ’s centre - back is my best position			0
' @entity0 added : ' there ’s places up for grabs - there ’s 11 shirts available for that first game against @entity10 and these next three warm - up matches will give the manager a good indication of who he wants to select			0
' need coaching through : @entity27 is going to his first major tournament and will be looked after @entity0 was at the opening of @entity164 , at the @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , for a week - long celebration of the lifestyle of football			0
open until may 31 .			0
