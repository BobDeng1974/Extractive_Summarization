announcement : @entity1 said his new policy on immigration was ' the right thing to do ' @entity1 ’s decision to allow up to allow up to 800,000 young illegal immigrants to remain in @entity7 has divided @entity8 and was met with silence by his 2012 opponent @entity10 for nearly six hours			1
the @entity1 administration ’s announcement that it would stop deporting and begin granting work permits to younger illegal immigrants who came to the @entity7 as children and have led law - abiding lives caught @entity10 by surprise			1
eventually , @entity10 came out and said in almost conciliatory language that he believed @entity1 had addressed an ‘ important matter ’ with a short - term measure but the way it had been done ‘ makes it more difficult to reach that long - term solution			1
he said that he supported a statement by senator @entity25 of @entity26 , who had been working on a proposal that @entity1 appeared to have hijacked			1
@entity10 ’s belated and muted reaction underlined just what a bind @entity8 had been placed in			1
speaking in the @entity31 about the announcement , @entity1 said it was a ‘ just ’ thing to do but not a permanent solution to the immigration issue			1
‘ this is not amnesty			0
this is not a path to citizenship			0
it is not a permanent fix			0
’ by bypassing @entity45 and acting via executive order , @entity1 ’s move is designed to tie @entity10 to an unpopular @entity47 as well as courting @entity49 voters , a key bloc in swing states like @entity26 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55			1
with some conservative sympathetic to @entity25 ’s proposal , not yet formally presented , and other against it , the @entity1 administration ’s surprise announcement laid bare a split in the @entity8			1
in a measured statement , @entity25 , of @entity62 parentage and a leading vice-presidential candidate for the @entity10 ticket , said it was ‘ welcome news for many of these kids desperate for an answer ’ but @entity1 was guilty of ‘ ignoring the @entity67 and going around @entity45 ’			1
@entity1 ’s executive order was a ‘ short term answer to a long term problem ’ , he added			1
‘ there is broad support for the idea that we should figure out a way to help kids who are undocumented through no fault of their own , but there is also broad consensus that it should be done in a way that does not encourage illegal immigration in the future			0
‘ this is a difficult balance to strike , one that this new policy , imposed by executive order , will make harder to achieve in the long run			1
’ mandate : the president , speaking in the @entity31 at the @entity92 had used executive order to bypass @entity45 supporters ; immigration activists gather in front of the @entity92 to celebrate the announcement @entity98 , runner up to @entity10 in the @entity8 primaries blasted @entity1			1
‘ here we are again on a friday afternoon on a quiet summer weekend with no one paying attention and president @entity1 announces yet another abuse of power - a decision to stop deporting and grant work permits to nearly one million immigrants who entered or remained in the @entity7 illegally as children , ’ he said			1
representative @entity108 of @entity109 , a favourite among conservative hardliners , said the change in the law ‘ signifies to potential illegal aliens that border agents will turn a blind eye ’			0
senator @entity117 of @entity118 , said via twitter : ‘ president @entity1 ’s attempt to go around @entity45 and the @entity7 people is at best unwise and possibly illegal			1
’ he added : ‘ this type of policy proposal , regardless of motivation , will entice people to break our laws			2
’ emotional : @entity127 , right , wipes tears away after @entity1 's announcement on immigration @entity131 : undocumented @entity133 students who came to the @entity7 as children celebrate after hearing the announcement on the day of their graduation @entity1 ’s order bypasses @entity45 and partially achieves the goals of the so - called @entity139 , a long - sought but never enacted plan to establish a path toward citizenship for young people who came to the @entity7 illegally as children but who attend college or join the military			1
it came a week before @entity1 ’s address the @entity149 ' annual conference in @entity150 , @entity26			2
@entity10 is due to speak there on thursday			2
under the administration plan , illegal immigrants will be immune from deportation if they were brought to the @entity7 before age 16 and are younger than 30 , have been in the country for at least five continuous years , have no criminal history , graduated from a @entity7 high school or earned a ged , or served in the military			0
should illegal immigrants who arrived in the @entity7 as children but now lead law - abiding lives be allowed to stay ? should illegal immigrants who arrived in the @entity7 as children but now lead law - abiding lives be allowed to stay ? now share your opinion they also can apply for a work permit that will be good for two years with no limits on how many times it can be renewed			0
@entity171 , homeland security secretary , said in a memorandum : ‘ many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways , prosecutorial discretion , which is used in so many other areas , is especially justified here			0
' the policy will not lead toward citizenship but will remove the threat of deportation and grant the ability to work legally , leaving eligible immigrants able to remain in the @entity7 for extended periods			0
@entity1 's extraordinary move comes in an election year in which the @entity49 vote could be critical in swing states like @entity55 , @entity54 and @entity26			1
while @entity1 enjoys support from a majority of @entity49 voters , @entity49 enthusiasm for the president has been tempered by the slow economic recovery , his inability to win congressional support for a broad overhaul of immigration laws and by his administration 's aggressive deportation policy			1
activists opposing his deportation policies last week mounted a hunger strike at an @entity1 campaign office in @entity208 , and other protests were planned for this weekend			2
campaign trail : @entity8 presidential candidate and former massachusetts governor @entity10 was at an event in @entity213 , @entity214 , today significant pause ? @entity10 did not use the opportunity to speak about @entity1 's immigration announcement the change is likely to cause an outcry from congressional @entity8 , who are sure to perceive @entity1 's actions as an end run around them			1
republicans already have complained that previous administration uses of prosecutorial discretion in deportations amount to back - door amnesty			2
@entity10 and many @entity8 lawmakers want tighter border security measures before considering changes in immigration law			2
@entity10 opposes offering legal status to illegal immigrants who attend college but has said he would do so for those who serve in the armed forces			2
an @entity239 / @entity238 poll last month found @entity1 leading @entity10 among @entity49 voters 61 percent to 27 percent			1
but his administration 's deportation policies have come under fire , and @entity49 leaders have raised the subject in private meetings with the president			2
in 2011 , @entity248 deported a record 396,906 people and is expected to deport about 400,000 this year			0
plan : @entity1 's policy is the same proposed by senator @entity25 a december poll by the @entity253 showed that 59 percent of @entity254 disapproved of the president 's handling of deportations			1
the changes come a year after the administration announced plans to focus on deporting serious criminals , immigrants who pose threats to public safety and national security , and serious immigration law violators			0
one of the officials said the latest policy change is just another step in the administration 's evolving approach to immigration			2
under the plan , immigrants whose deportation cases are pending in immigration court will have to prove their eligibility for a reprieve to @entity248 , which will begin dealing with such cases in 60 days			0
any immigrant who already has a deportation order and those who never have been encountered by immigration authorities will deal with the @entity284			0
the exact details of how the program will work , including how much immigrants will have to pay to apply and what proof they will need , still are being worked out			0
in making it harder to deport , the @entity1 administration is in essence employing the same eligibility requirements spelled out in the proposed @entity139			2
the administration officials stopped short of calling the change an administrative @entity139 — the name is an acronym for @entity297 — but the qualifications meet those laid out in a 2010 version that failed in the @entity301 after passing in the @entity92			0
they said the @entity139 , in some form , and comprehensive overhaul of the immigration system remained an administration priority			0
illegal immigrant children wo n't be eligible to apply for the deportation waiver until they turn 16 , but the officials said younger children wo n't be deported either			0
last year , @entity310 announced plans to review about 300,000 pending deportation cases and indefinitely suspend those that did n't meet department priorities			0
so far , @entity248 has reviewed more than 232,000 cases and decided to stop working on about 20,000			0
about 4,000 of those 20,000 have opted to keep fighting in court to stay in the @entity7 legally			0
for the people who opted to close their cases , work permits are not guaranteed .			0

@entity1 : this is not amnesty , this is not immunity *...* this is right thing to do
president used executive order on decision , bypassing @entity45
@entity10 waits six hours before saying policy was a short - term measure
it *mirrors* that of proposal by @entity10 's *tipped* running mate @entity25
