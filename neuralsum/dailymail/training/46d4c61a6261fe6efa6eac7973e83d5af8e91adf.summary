@entity0 sat down for contract talks with @entity2 on sunday – 70 days after winning the world title			1
in blue - sky @entity6 on the first - day of pre-season testing , @entity0 talked through his future with @entity9 , the head of @entity2 motorsport , and @entity12 , the chairman			1
both sides spoke of striking a new deal – worth about £ 60million over three years – as a formality			1
@entity0 was effusive , saying : ‘ we have talked			1
we can come to agreement			0
we want to stay together			0
we love each other , basically			0
’ @entity0 poses for a selfie with team - mate @entity20 on the morning of the first winter test @entity0 is bidding to win his third formula one world title after he claimed the 2014 crown @entity0 , who is in the final year of his @entity2 contract , will partner @entity20 once more in 2015 @entity12 said : ‘ there is no problem with the contract			1
he wants to sign it			0
we want him to sign it			0
we just need to find a time to do it , and then all the speculation can go away			0
’ logic says staying at @entity2 is the sensible option : they are the super-team of the moment			2
but @entity39 could yet intervene			2
not only does the brand hold the greatest allure , not least to a driver whose avowed intent is to be ‘ a legend ’ , but chairman @entity45 is an avid @entity0 fan			2
they could also potentially offer him more money than @entity2 , whose budget could be restricted by their board in @entity50			2
@entity0 held talks with @entity12 and @entity9 over a new deal with @entity2 in @entity6 on sunday @entity0 and @entity20 unveil the 2015 @entity2 car , which they hope will be the cream of the crop again according to one contact there has already been contact between @entity39 and @entity0			1
however , a reliable source close to @entity0 denies this is the case			2
either way , there could be a space at @entity39 next season if they release @entity66 , whose contract expires at the end of the year			1
so why the delay ? ‘ we left it until the end of last year , but then we did n’t see one another , ’ said @entity0 , who takes over driving duties from team - mate @entity20 on monday			1
‘ i ’m still under contract this year , so we have time			0
it ’s not something i have to rush to satisfy anyone else			0
’ @entity79 completed only six laps on the first day of the season 's opening winter test in @entity6 @entity0 confirmed that @entity79 , now of @entity83 , rang @entity2 about joining them last year @entity2 ’ strength heading into the new season , which starts in @entity86 on march 15 , was underlined by @entity20 doing a massive 157 laps			1
his high mileage was in contrast to the @entity90 of @entity79 , who , as @entity0 confirmed , rang @entity2 about joining them last year			1
the @entity92 was the star attraction for a large home crowd who hung around the paddock			0
but , with @entity83 coming to terms with their new engine , there is plenty of road for them to travel .			0
