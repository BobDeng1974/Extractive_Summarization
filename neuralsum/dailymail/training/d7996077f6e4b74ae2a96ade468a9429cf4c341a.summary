by @entity0 published : 17:56 est , 23 september 2013 updated : 02:21 est , 24 september 2013 critical : @entity3 boss @entity2 attacked the prime minister and chancellor at a launch in @entity7 @entity3 boss @entity2 has launched a highly personal attack on @entity9 and @entity10 , saying they lack vision on the economy and only ‘ respond to whatever is topical ’			1
mr @entity2 , who is angered by the delays in making a decision over the future of @entity18 , also accused the prime minister and his chancellor of fostering the image that the lucrative @entity7 tourism market is n’t welcome here			1
the chief executive of @entity23 , owner of both @entity3 and @entity26 ’s @entity25 , has previously sparred with the government over its aviation policy but went a step further yesterday			1
at the opening of @entity3 ’s new route to @entity32 in south central @entity7 , he said : ‘ i am not a fan of @entity9 or @entity10			1
' i have no political affiliation			1
' i have n’t seen much evidence of visionary leadership there and to me they respond to whatever is topical rather than setting out a long term plan or vision for growth in the @entity45 economy			1
’ he said he is pleased that there is more optimism about the economy but warned there is a long way to go			1
‘ if i was osborne i would n’t be popping the champagne corks at this stage , ’ he said			1
‘ there ’s little evidence steps are being taken that are going to be more conducive to growth , and ... we need to see greater optimism , greater visibility and a bit of vision for the future and i think that ’s lacking			1
’ the government has asked sir @entity66 to spearhead the @entity67 to examine capacity in the @entity45 , but mr @entity2 said he believes it is futile			1
‘ i ’ve said all along and i have met @entity66 twice now that i think he will produce a fantastic report – it has got to be the best report on airports ever seen , ’ he said			1
‘ but nothing is going to happen with it because it will be handed over to politicians who wo n’t act on it			1
i still do n’t see any prospect of any political party taking hold of the report and actually doing something with it			1
‘ so i have no criticisms of @entity66 or what they are doing			2
but i still do n’t see any prospect of any political party taking hold of the report and actually doing something with it			2
’ he also claimed the government ’s ‘ bureaucratic ’ approach to issuing visas to @entity7 tourists is harming tourism			1
trade between the @entity45 and @entity7 has been steadily increasing and @entity7 is now the @entity45 ’s eighth biggest export market			1
no vision ? : @entity9 and @entity10 have just been celebrating what looks like economic success mr @entity2 wants answers from the government on when a decision will be made on @entity18 's future he also predicted there will be a raft of @entity108 airlines going out of business in the next 12 months however , @entity7 people travelling here – even in transit – need a visa , which is not required if they land in continental @entity108			1
‘ we need a visa regime that it less bureaucratic , ’ he said			2
‘ it is getting better but people need to feel that the @entity45 is actually welcoming them			2
‘ i think there is a perception in @entity7 that the @entity45 does not want to see @entity7 tourists and @entity7 business and i think we have got to put a bit of effort into changing that image			1
he said the @entity45 is missing out on a ‘ huge opportunity ’			2
he added : ‘ we are losing out to organised tour groups in @entity108 who bypass the @entity45 as it is too much trouble to get two visas			2
' i think if we are to be attractive to the high end tourists particularly , in the @entity45 we will have to have more people who can speak @entity134 , speak @entity7 and make them feel welcome			1
‘ not just at the airports but at major tourists venues as well			2
’ mr @entity2 has previously said he thinks it is ‘ tragic ’ that @entity18 will never succeed in getting a third runway because of political failure and that the airport will be left behind by faster growing hubs			1
he said he believes politicians are not brave enough to grasp this and that @entity18 missed the opportunity of expansion many years ago			1
he also predicted that there will be a raft of @entity108 airlines going out of business over the next 12 months and said he is interested in making some acquisitions but has nothing currently in his sights			2

@entity156 , @entity157 , @entity45 , 2 hours ago put your money where your mouth is and stand for pm then mr @entity2 ! @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity45 , 3 hours ago @entity164 , arrogant , and toffee nosed			2
and that 's only the cabin waitresses ( trolley dollies ) and waiters i 'm talking about			0
the cockpit crew think they are gods and as for management , they look down on @entity174			0
@entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , 4 hours ago i wish someone would beat this little leprechaun severely with his shillelagh			0
that might shut his big mouth			0
funnybone , dorset , @entity45 , 5 hours ago true , but be careful , @entity2 , they have ways of making you walk ! @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity177 , 5 hours ago @entity199 - in my opinion - @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 and @entity189 - in my opinion - @entity191 , - @entity192 and @entity194 carriers are are nothing special @entity202 favorite airline is @entity203			0
i fly a lot so the above - apart from @entity191 - is based on experience of air travel in all classes from first to economy			0
. @entity209 , @entity45 , @entity45 , 5 hours ago i 'd recommend he develops his flying hub in @entity26			0
they currently have three brand new airports - one with the longest runway in @entity108 - that can be bought for a song			0
they have excellent high speed rail connections that will whisk you anywhere at 300km/hr			0
here on the other hand , the green lobby is so powerful that he 'll be whistling in the wind just for a 3rd runway at an airport that runs at 98 % capacity , he 'll wait forever for a decent train service that 's on - time and fast , and his passengers will continue to be forced to pay the highest airport ( green ? ) taxes in the @entity229			0
and we thought we could teach @entity108 a lesson or two ! @entity233 @entity232 , @entity234 , @entity45 , 5 hours ago he 's right but it 's fairly naive to think that @entity236 and @entity10 are interested in anything other than a ) what is in their own best interest b ) as a result of a ) , what is most topical ( rather than most pressing ) they 're politicians , so their agenda will not involve what is best for the @entity246 - it involves what 's best for them			0
@entity187 , @entity188 , @entity177 , 5 hours ago if i was the ceo of @entity3 i would start by sorting out @entity3 before i had a shot at anybody else			0
@entity3 are nothing special , they could start by washing their aircraft and employing some good looking female flight attendants who do n't think they are doing you a favor by serving a meal			0
if you want good service and new airplanes fly @entity203			0
