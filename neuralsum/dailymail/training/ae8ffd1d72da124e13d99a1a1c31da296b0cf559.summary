@entity0 in @entity1 is often referred to as having one of the world 's most frightening airport runways			1
and these holidaymakers who were enjoying a day at the beach in the @entity7 certainly found out why			0
the airport , while being the second - busiest airport in the @entity9 , has a runway of just 7,152 feet in length - and it is located right next to the beach			0
@entity0 in @entity1 is known to have the world 's scariest runway tourists can stand right against the fence along the runway 's perimeter , across the street from a local beach though sufficient for small or medium - sized jets , large carriers fly extremely low over the nearby beach , often only just clearing the perimeter 's fence			1
the video begins as the plane prepares to take off and sunbathers emerge from the water at @entity31 for a closer look at the @entity33			0
the video begins with three brave individuals attempting to hold on as the plane accelerates unfortunately , one tourist can not withstand the blast and is catapulted backwards toward a concrete path the woman landed headfirst against the beach 's wall as passersby raced to her side to help several daredevils are then seen holding onto the wire fence that separates the airport runway from the local sandy beach			1
as the plane begins to accelerate , the sand and dirt kicks up , causing a literal whirlwind among the several brave tourists who are attempting to hang on			0
just a second later , one of the remaining two still holding onto the wall is blasted into the air , away from the fence and into a concrete footpath just feet from the fence itself .			2

passersby in @entity1 attempt to hold onto fence while jet accelerates

one tourist found this out first hand , as jet blast launched her into the air
