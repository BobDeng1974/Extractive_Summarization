by @entity0 published : 06:41 est , 25 april 2013 updated : 06:42 est , 25 april 2013 a grandfather died after doctors failed to diagnose his treatable lung cancer for two years			1
in may 2010 , father - of - two @entity4 , 65 , had a ct scan that should have showed he was suffering from the early stages of lung cancer			1
however , staff at @entity11 told the former @entity13 worker that he was just suffering from a chest infection			1
@entity4 ( left ) died after it took doctors two years to diagnose his lung cancer			1
he is pictured with his son , @entity18 mr @entity4 then continued to battle persistent pain for almost two years , coughing up blood and becoming anaemic , until he was rushed to hospital with breathing difficulties in february 2012			1
in @entity23 he was given a chest x-ray which revealed the tumour had grown to five times its original size			2
at this point , the doctors suspected that he was suffering from lung cancer but before they were able to act on their findings , or inform his family , mr @entity4 died			2
the hospital has now admitted misdiagnosing mr @entity4 , and accepts that early diagnosis could have prolonged his life by ten years , but his angry family have said it is all ' too little too late '			1
his son , @entity36 , said : ‘ my father put his complete trust in the doctors who treated him and had confidence that they were doing everything they could to help him			0
‘ he never discovered that the doctors had completely missed his cancer			0
two years before he died , mr @entity4 ( pictured with his grandson ) , had a ct scan which should have told doctors that he had early stage lung cancer but he was told he just had a chest infection ‘ looking back it 's hard to believe the doctors missed the warning signs that something was seriously wrong			1
‘ he had been coughing up blood for months and still they did not think to check for cancer			2
’ @entity56 , a lawyer at medical negligence specialists @entity58 , said : ‘ an independent medical expert concluded that if clinicians had reviewed the ct scan taken in 2010 , the one centimetre nodule on @entity4 's upper left lung would have been clearly visible and would in turn have indicated he was suffering from the early stages of lung cancer			1
his son , @entity18 , is now urging other people to seek a second opinion if they are worried about their symptoms ‘ at this point , the cancer was highly treatable and a combination of surgery and either radiotherapy or chemotherapy could in all likelihood have extended his lifespan by around ten years			0
’ @entity36 said : ‘ by the time he was admitted to hospital his breathing had become very laboured			0
‘ even then we believed the doctors ' diagnosis that he just had a chest infection and clung to the hope that it was a passing illness that he would get over			2
‘ the fact he was such a proud man who did n't like to complain , meant opportunities to make him comfortable were also missed			0
‘ the hospital had reassured my sister that there was no need for the family to dash up to see him as he was stable and would hopefully be home within a couple of days			0
sadly he died the following morning			0
’ following a full admission of liability , @entity11 , has offered a full apology to mr @entity4 ’s family and has paid a five figure out of court settlement			1
@entity36 said : ‘ although sadly it 's too late for our family , i would urge others to seek a second opinion if they find that their condition fails to improve			0
‘ no one wants a doctor to tell them they have cancer , but in dad 's case , hearing those words two years earlier , when the scan was first taken , could have given him ten more precious years with his family			2
’ @entity4 , who worked at the @entity13 plant in @entity11 for more than 30 years , leaves behind his wife @entity119 , aged 62 , a son and daughter as well as two grandchildren			2
@entity11 has apologised to mr @entity4 's family and have paid compensation @entity124 , chief medical officer at the trust said : ‘ i would like to apologise to mr @entity4 ’s wife and his family that his cancer was not recognised when his scan was read			1
‘ while errors of this kind are extremely rare , it does n’t detract from the pain and distress this has caused			0
‘ we have reviewed how the mistake was made and have tried to learn lessons from it			0
‘ we hope that the financial settlement can help in some way but we recognise it will never compensate mr @entity4 ’s family for their loss			0

@entity4 had a scan in may 2010 and was told he had a chest infection
staff at @entity11 failed to see he had early stage cancer
for the next two years he was in *constant* pain and coughing up blood
in february 2012 he was rushed to hospital with breathing difficulties
chest x-ray revealed he had cancer - he died before treatment could start
hospital trust has apologised and paid out compensation to the family
