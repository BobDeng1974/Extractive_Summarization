by @entity0 , @entity1 under - fire @entity2 remains a ' world - class player ' in the opinion of @entity6 and one who the @entity9 teenager is honoured to be learning from every day			1
the 28 - year - old @entity2 knows all too well about the scrutiny that comes with representing the @entity9 , having been the focus of national team 's hopes since bursting onto the scene at @entity15			1
but @entity6 is also mindful of taking to the field opposite @entity18 team - mate @entity17 , who is a doubt for @entity21 's match with @entity9 on thursday following knee surgery			1
praise : @entity6 ( left ) insists that @entity9 team - mate ( right ) @entity2 remains ' world class ' smiles : @entity6 believes @entity2 could still perform a big role for @entity9 but is happy to keep playing at 10 he said : ' i 'd rather not see him on the pitch , really			1
' he is a great player , but i do n't think we really need to talk too much of his qualities because we all know what he can do			1
' all the lads have played against him before , know what he is about			0
' we know he has scored some spectacular goals and we will do our best to keep him at bay			0
' @entity2 's standing meanwhile saw him dominate the build - up to @entity9 's @entity40 opener against @entity41 , as well as the fallout to saturday 's promising , if frustrating , 2 - 1 defeat			1
a muted performance in an unfavoured wide role in @entity46 have led to calls for him to dropped , whereas at the other end of the spectrum the talk surrounding @entity49 has intensified following an exciting performance			2
the 19 - year - old is all - but certain to start the crunch encounter with @entity21 - a match he approaches without the burden of expectation thanks to @entity2 's words of wisdom			2
teacher : @entity6 ( left ) says he learns things every day from @entity2 ( right ) in training under pressure : @entity2 was poor in an unfamiliar position on the left for @entity9 against @entity41 in @entity46 ' i speak to him a lot , ' @entity6 said			1
' he just says to relax , express yourself and enjoy the game , really , and not to think too much about what is going on and to just play your normal game and you 'll be fine			0
' some of the stuff he does with the ball , you try to take little clips out of his play and try to really learn from that			0
' he is a world - class player , i 've watched him growing up			0
he is someone i looked up to so to have trained with him at this camp has been a real honour , really			0
' he works really hard and is always improving as well , so for someone like that for me to look up to i am really glad to have him the team			0
' @entity2 's advice is clearly working , with @entity49 shaking - off the understandable pre-match nerves to create havoc within the @entity86 ranks			0
the teenager was quick to insist that anxiety was down to the occasion rather than the position he was playing , given his role down the middle saw @entity2 shunted out wide			2
decisions : @entity95 ( right ) is contemplating whether to keep @entity2 ( left ) on the left feared : @entity21 's @entity17 ( right ) is not a player who @entity6 wants to see line - up against @entity9 a winger by trade , it meant @entity6 was also playing out of position and led one reporter to ask whether it would work if they swapped roles for the @entity108 clash with @entity21			1
' it is up to the manager to decide , at the end other day , ' @entity6 said			2
' that is my normal position out on the wing , so with his vision and his passing abilities and my running abilities , it could be a really , really good thing			0
' but , as i said , it is down to manager at the end of the day			0
' fitness battle : @entity17 has been training following knee surgery but is a doubt to start against @entity9 focused : @entity6 ( left ) and his @entity9 team - mates train ahead of thursday 's clash with @entity21			1

@entity6 says he is honoured to be learning from @entity2 every day
@entity2 has been under pressure following poor *display* against @entity41
he was asked to play in unfamiliar wide left role and *struggled* in @entity46
@entity6 does not want to see ' great player ' @entity17 line - up opposite him
he also says it is up to @entity95 to decide where he plays for @entity9
