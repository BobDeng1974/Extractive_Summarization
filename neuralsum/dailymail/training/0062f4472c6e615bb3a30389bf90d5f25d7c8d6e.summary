by @entity1 correspondent published : 16:59 est , 11 may 2012 updated : 02:10 est , 25 june 2012 fruity : women with pear - shaped figures like @entity5 are healthier than their apple - shaped counterparts , according to research it may not help when it comes to squeezing into skinny jeans or slipping on a slinky dress			1
but it seems having a big bottom could offer some benefits – at least when it comes to health			2
women with pear - shaped figures are healthier than their apple - shaped counterparts , according to research			1
or in other words , those with a defined waist and shapely derriere like @entity5 are better off than those with a small bottom who are plumper around the middle			0
former government adviser dr @entity26 worked with a nutritionist from @entity28 to review data from dozens of studies on the best method of judging someone ’s health from their vital statistics			2
and their conclusion could mean the end of the body mass index , or @entity40 – a mathematical formula linking weight to height which has been in widespread use since the early 1970s			1
however , this formula fails to distinguish between fat and muscle , meaning some athletes are classed as obese			0
an alternative measure of health is waist circumference , which is considered important because fat that gathers around the stomach is known to be particularly harmful			0
not only does it produce more dangerous chemicals , but it is also closer to the body ’s vital organs than flab on the bottom , hips and thighs			2
but this method is flawed too , as it does n’t take into account differing heights			1
so the solution , says dr @entity65 , who runs independent consultancy @entity66 , is to look at waist measurement in comparison to height			0
healthy prospects : with their well - defined derrieres @entity74 and @entity75 are also considered a healthy pear - shape her analysis of 31 studies involving 300,000 men and women from around the world showed doing this to be a better predictor of health than either @entity40 or waist circumference			1
as a rule of thumb , we should aim to keep our waist circumference measurement to under half that of our height			0
so , a woman who is 5ft 4in should try to keep her waist below 32in and a man who is 5ft 10in should n’t let his waistband exceed 35in			2
any bigger than this and their shape starts to turn from pear - like to apple - like			1
using waist to height as a measure should pick up potential illnesses quicker than @entity40 and is also suitable for all ages and all ethnicities			1
dr @entity65 told the @entity105 in @entity106 : ‘ keeping your waist circumference to less than half of your height could help increase life expectancy for every person in the world			0
streamline : among the famous apple shapes with less - defined waists are actresses @entity117 and @entity119 ‘ you can measure it in centimetres , inches , miles , anything you want			2
’ pear - shaped celebrities , who are wider below the waist , include actress @entity5 and singers @entity75 and @entity74			1
among the apples , with less - defined waists , are singer @entity129 , model @entity119 and actress @entity117			0
dr @entity65 ’s system of measuring has another advantage			0
those people whose waist is bigger than it should be can take @entity136 from around the tummy is usually the first to go when we start a diet .			0

new research says big - bottomed women are healthier than apple - shaped ones
conclusion could mean end of body mass index ( @entity40 )
method is flawed as it does n’t take into account differing heights
