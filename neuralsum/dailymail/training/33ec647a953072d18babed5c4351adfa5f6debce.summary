for around 10 years the large marine mammal has been fed by the finest fish usually destined for some of the capital 's top restaurants			1
despite being in the heart of @entity3 just yards from @entity12 the grey seal has resisted any attempts to release it into the wild			1
dockside porters at @entity34 have become so used to @entity20 they even ' call him ' for dinner by banging at metal bar at the side of the dock			2
billingsgate constable @entity40 said : ‘ they 've tried to release @entity20 into the wild in the past but he just comes back , he 's obviously happy here or he would n't			1
‘ @entity20 usually turns up in the morning and the porters bang on the metal bar at the side of the dock and up he pops out of the water			2
‘ he 's obviously well fed and he must have been coming here for the last 10 years , i 'm a @entity49 and you do n't see many seals about to be honest			1
‘ his favourite fish is salmon , i 'm not surprised given the size of some of the ones thrown over the fence to him			0
’ @entity20 's favourite food is salmon and seal experts have said it would be cruel to stop feeding him now experts have said the markings on the seal 's coat suggest @entity20 could be a female but seal experts have cast doubt on @entity20 's credentials - and now believe his markings show he might actually be female			1
@entity72 , from the @entity73 , said @entity20 may be a @entity74 rather than a @entity75 due to the markings on the seal 's coat			1
she said : ‘ we normally advise people not to feed seals in the wild but as @entity20 ... has been there so long it would be cruel to stop			1
’ @entity20 has been spotted by workers from the area and market shoppers over the years and one wildlife enthusiast even uploaded footage of the seal online			1
he is such a regular face around the docks at @entity34 the he has been included in @entity92 's @entity91 since 2008			0
@entity92 ’s @entity93 and @entity94 , @entity95 , said : ' sightings such as @entity20 are very important ; they help to build up a picture of the rivers ’ role in the ecology of @entity102 marine mammals			2
' we need people to keep an eye out and to detail their sightings at @entity106 – it could help conservationists in the future			0
' @entity20 was first named by @entity110 , who spotted him when working at @entity12 's @entity112 building			0
