@entity40 where doctors failed to see that @entity7 had broken her back in two places she said as the children played happily they went down the big tunnel slide - a curving metal tube big enough to take adults			1
ms @entity7 - who is afraid of tube slides - finally decided to ignore her fears after being ' egged on ' by her children			1
she said : ' all the kids went down the slide before me and they were shouting ' come on mum get down it ' ' i have a fear of tunnel slides like that but they kept on at me so i took the plunge and went down			0
but at the bottom i just flew off and landed hard on my back			0
ms @entity7 's nine children aged 11 months to 18 years whom she was playing with in @entity9 's @entity25 ' straight away i knew there was something wrong and i had been injured			2
' paramedics were in the park for the show and were on scene quickly but decided that ms @entity7 needed an x-ray to assess the damage because she was in so much pain			1
but things went wrong from the time she arrived at nearby @entity40 's accident and emergency unit			0
she said : ' i arrived at hospital and was given a tablet painkiller then left for around three hours before a doctor came and ordered x-rays			2
@entity80 says the slide which ms @entity7 fell off conforms to @entity83 and @entity84 safety standards ' the a and e department was very busy and i waited another hour after the x-rays were taken , before another doctor came and said they were clear and i was just badly bruised			1
' it was 1 am when she was given the news and she was kept in spending the night on the clinical decisions ward ( @entity93 )			0
she said : ' the next morning i was seen by a physiotherapist because i was still struggling to walk			0
i was then discharged without seeing another doctor or any further follow up			0
' after she was allowed home the pain continued and she fell in her bathroom			0
. as a result she was bed bound by severe pain in her upper back and hips and was unable to use the crutches the hospital had loaned her			2

' @entity112 called for an ambulance and she had to be carried out on a stretcher to return to the hospital that had discharged her 24 hours earlier			1
another doctor examined her x-rays after she was admitted and said there had been some damage to her upper back but said she was fit enough to return home with painkillers			2
however , ms @entity7 , still wracked with pain , refused to leave the hospital and staff reluctantly admitted her onto a ward			2
she said : ' the next morning an orthopaedic surgeon looked at the same x-rays and told me i had two quite bad breaks in my back			0
' he said : ' yes you have done a pretty good job at it as well ' as if to say ' i ca n't believe you 've done that on a children 's slide '			0
' a ct scan also revealed a slight change from the earlier x-rays because the broken bones had crushed into her spinal canal and an operation was needed			0
ms @entity7 said : ' i 'm angry and disgusted that that it was overlooked on x-ray			1
i shudder at the thought if i did n't go back to hospital i could still be at home suffering and ended up with permanent nerve damage			0
