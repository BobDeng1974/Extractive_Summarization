by @entity1 reporter published : 14:52 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 18:44 est , 17 november 2013 @entity2 tied up a lady , who suffers from dementia , because she did not want her wandering around the care home a care home assistant used a dressing gown cord to tie an 88 - year - old woman with dementia to a chair while she went outside to smoke a cigarette			1
a court was told that @entity2 , 43 , restrained the pensioner because she had been wandering around the care home			1
she told a colleague what she had done and was reported to police , but denied it when interviewed by officers			0
however , she later went back to the police station to admit her crime after being questioned by care home bosses at an internal inquiry			1
when she was finally brought before a court , she pleaded guilty to a charge of ill - treating and wilfully neglecting a person without capacity			2
@entity2 was spared a jail sentence , however , when judge @entity29 gave her a 12 - month supervision order			1
when the offence came to light , she was dismissed from her job at @entity35 , a @entity36 care home in @entity37 , @entity38 , where she had worked for about ten years			1
@entity39 was told the victim had been repeatedly getting out of bed and walking around when @entity2 arrived during an overnight shift earlier this year			1
prosecutor @entity43 said the incident was over ‘ in a matter of minutes ’			0
miss @entity43 added : ‘ the victim had been wandering around			2
and miss @entity2 had been chasing after her and following her around			1
however , a time came when she sat her down in her chair and , using the cord of her dressing gown , tied it on the chair			2
’ summing up later , judge @entity54 said a key detail was the fact that it was secured around her waist in such a way that the woman would have been able to untie herself			0
he told @entity2 , of @entity60 , @entity38 : ‘ you were in charge of looking after an old lady suffering from dementia			1
‘ she was sat in the chair and you put the dressing gown cord around her waist			0
it was tied in a bow			2
she could have undone it			0
‘ i sentence you on the basis that she was only tied to the chair for a number of minutes			0
‘ it is a serious matter to ill - treat someone who lacks mental capacity in a home , but it does seem that this offence is right at the bottom of the scale			2
’ the court heard the carer , who suffers from schizophrenia , was dismissed from her role at @entity86 , a @entity36 care home in @entity37 , @entity38 , after an internal review into the ill - treatment of the woman judge @entity54 said there was no evidence that the woman suffered any distress and he did not understand why the case had not been dealt with at an earlier hearing at @entity96 in @entity97			1
@entity98 , defending , said @entity2 had lost her livelihood and record of previous good character because of one incident in many years of caring for people with dementia			1
miss @entity98 said : ‘ she has a long history of caring for vulnerable people in that home			0
what happened means she has stopped taking her medication			0
she has had a number of difficulties with her health			0
’ in a statement after sentencing , @entity114 , of @entity115 , said : ‘ the behaviour of @entity2 was clearly unacceptable			2
‘ we immediately suspended her and reported her to the appropriate authorities to ensure that vulnerable older people are protected			0
the court has now taken appropriate action			0
