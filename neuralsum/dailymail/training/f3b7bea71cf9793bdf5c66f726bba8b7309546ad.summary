parking your car is usually considered an annoying yet necessary chore , but these stunning structures are re-inventing the wheel			0
from the world 's most famous parking garage - the @entity6 in @entity7 - to the haunting , gothic beauty of the converted @entity10 in @entity11 , eco-friendly , aesthetically - pleasing car parks are a growing trend			1
adjacent to the @entity16 factory in @entity17 , @entity7 , the @entity6 is an entire car community , complete with an office , museum and production space			1
but it 's pièce de résistance ? the twin 60m car park towers made entirely of glass and steel , also known as the final stop for cars from the factory			2
for a more art deco feel , try the avant garde 1111 @entity30 parking garage in @entity32 , @entity33			1
designed by @entity35 firm @entity34 , the open air structure - which is said to resemble a ' house of cards ' - also boasts a fashion boutique on its fifth floor , a seventh floor event space , and a penthouse apartment , pool and gardens			0
in the @entity49 , head to either @entity45 or @entity46 for a glimpse at @entity49 - made architectural marvels			0
@entity51 @entity50 in @entity52 has been dubbed the ' @entity54 ' thanks to its cubed exterior , while the @entity57 car park , in @entity46 , designed by architect @entity58 at @entity59 , glows blue at night thanks to its impressive paneling			1
and for those particularly into trend - setting design , go down under to @entity64 , @entity65 , for a glimpse of the city 's @entity68 car park			2
the tallest building in the city not only offers nine storeys of parking , but also has a painted interior with lettering that appears to ' jump out ' of its surroundings			0

@entity7 's @entity6 is an entire community *dedicated* to @entity16 vehicles - complete with twin car park towers
1111 @entity30 in @entity33 looks more like an avant garde event space and shopping mall than a parking garage
the @entity51 @entity50 in @entity52 has been dubbed the ' @entity54 ' *due* to its *jagged* metallic panelling
