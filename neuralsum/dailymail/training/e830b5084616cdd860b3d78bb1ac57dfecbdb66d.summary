@entity1 will step down in may after 22 years , making her the longest - serving boss in the programme ’s history			1
but although she has increased ratings , she has been heavily criticised for ‘ sexing up ’ the show unnecessarily			1
during her tenure @entity1 has transformed from a sedate tale of rural life to a serial filled with racy plots and steamy storylines			2
miss @entity1 ’s overhaul initially led to the popular show achieving record ratings in 2005 due to its ‘ who ’s the daddy ? ’ storyline involving brothers @entity26 and @entity28 and @entity28 ’s wife @entity29			1
the programme received its highest lunchtime audience of 2.44million and an average of 4.86million a week – the highest since january 2003			0
however , it was a different story several years later with some 200,000 listeners ditching @entity1 in revolt over the controversial storylines , which by then had included a gay wedding and one of the central characters betraying her husband			2
yesterday fans of the show posted comments on its website , underneath the announcement of miss @entity1 ’s departure , calling for the programme to return to its roots as a ‘ simple story ’ about rural and agricultural matters			1
one wrote : ‘ hopefully whoever takes over can rescue this once great programme and restore it to something approaching its former glory			2
the @entity1 is set in the fictional village of @entity1 , as mapped out in this official @entity4 map ratings : miss @entity1 's overhaul initially led to the popular show achieving record ratings in 2005 due to its ' who 's the daddy ? ' storyline involving brothers @entity26 and @entity28 and @entity28 's wife @entity29 ‘ maybe someone who both lives in a small working rural village and has an appreciation for the realities facing agriculture , rural communities and rural business in the modern day			1
’ another added : ‘ quality broadcasting was demoted in favour of scandal and red - top news			0
many good farming stories were down - played by gossip and class reared its ugly head			0
‘ those of us who live in a farming area find it a parody of reality			0
' hopefully a new editor will concentrate less on sexual liaisons and more on the place of farming today and its importance to our future in producing high - quality food			0
’ another listener said : ‘ return @entity1 to its @entity97			2
a rural community based in @entity98			0
’ miss @entity1 , a former producer of controversial @entity104 drama @entity102 , said she was departing to ‘ take a holiday , develop a project for tv drama and get involved in some more training overseas ’			1
she defended the changes she made , saying : ‘ it ’s zappier , it ’s crisper , it ’s faster and that ’s because audiences require more			0
i do n’t think it ’s necessarily any racier			0
