by @entity1 reporter newly declassified documents reveal how the @entity3 tried to start revolution in the @entity5 by printing and distributing the novel @entity7			1
when the @entity3 first reviewed @entity10 's manuscript in 1957 , they realized its high - propaganda potential and printed it in secret to be passed out to soviets at international meet - ups in @entity14			1
the plan was considered a success as @entity5 smuggled the banned book back to their home country and it was illicitly passed from person to person			1
the @entity3 distributed hundreds of copies of @entity10 's novel @entity7 to subvert the @entity5 in the midst of the @entity25			1
above , miniature versions of the novel that were printed by the @entity3 to be distributed at a 1959 youth conference authors @entity29 and @entity31 obtained the more than 100 @entity3 memos for their new book about the novel 's role in the @entity25			1
' the @entity36 : the @entity37 , the @entity3 and the @entity38 ' is due out this june			0
@entity29 and @entity31 previewed their book in the @entity40 , writing about how the @entity3 first obtained @entity10 's manuscript from @entity42 in 1958			1
the agents immediately recognized the books potential as propaganda ' not only for its intrinsic message and thought - provoking nature , but also for the circumstances of its publication '			0
' we have the opportunity to make @entity5 citizens wonder what is wrong with their government , when a fine literary work by the man acknowledged to be the greatest living @entity60 writer is not even available in his own country in his own language for his own people to read , ' the memo said			1
the novel follows the life of @entity66 , a physician and poet , as he falls in love with two women throughout decades of revolution , war and @entity73 oppression in @entity60			0
revelations : @entity29 and @entity31 reveal how the @entity75 tried to inspire revolution in the @entity5 with @entity10 's ( left ) book in ' the @entity36 ' ( right ) due out in june for many reasons , including the fact that the main character did not subscribe to official @entity81 ideology , @entity10 was considered a traitor and @entity5 publishers refused to print the book			1
however , an @entity86 literary scout was impressed with the book and it was first printed by a publisher there , in @entity86 , in 1957			0
but what made the book unpublishable in @entity10 's native country is what made it so alluring to @entity75 seeking to undermine the communist regime			2
' @entity10 's humanistic message - that every person is entitled to a private life and deserves respect as a human being , irrespective of the extent of his political loyalty or contribution to the state - poses a fundamental challenge to the @entity5 ethic of sacrifice of the individual to the @entity73 system , ' @entity97 , chief of the agency 's @entity98 , said in a memo , according to the @entity40			1
the @entity3 decided to print the book in secret through a foreign publisher to be distributed by agents around @entity14 - with an emphasis on the @entity120 in @entity121 , @entity122 where 16,000 @entity5 citizens were due to attend			1
of course the copies of the book could n't be handed out at the @entity127 's pavilion , so instead they enlisted the help of the @entity129			2
it was at the @entity132 's pavilion that 200 copies were handed out in a small library behind a ' somewhat hidden ' curtain			2
banned : the @entity75 had 200 copies of the novel passed out to visiting soviets at the @entity129 's pavilion at the @entity120			1
above , a picture from the 1958 exhibition @entity25 run - in : the @entity75 and @entity5 had their own pavilions at the @entity120 that advertised their competing ways of life			2
above , a woman waves a @entity5 flag at the exhibition ' soon the book â€™s blue linen covers were littering the fairgrounds			2
some who got the novel were ripping off the cover , dividing the pages , and stuffing them in their pockets to make the book easier to hide , ' the authors wrote			0
adaptation : the novel was turned into a movie in 1965 starring @entity162 and @entity163 , and went on to earn five academy awards the books dispersal at the @entity120 was so successful that word got back to @entity10 himself in the @entity5 that people were reading @entity7 in the original @entity60			1
but the plan did have one draw back			0
despite the instruction that @entity75 's hand ' not be shown in any manner ' , the @entity3 messed up in printing the book by violating the @entity86 publisher 's rights			0
the publishing house objected , and attention was drawn to the fact that so many books were being printed			0
an anonymous columnist for the @entity182 was sharp enough to pinpoint the blame on the @entity3			0
' that quaint workshop of amateur subversion , the @entity3 , may be exorbitantly expensive but from time to time it produces some noteworthy goodies , ' columnist ' @entity184 ' wrote			0
but overall , the @entity3 found the operation a success and decided to pull it off again at a @entity193 youth conference the following year			1
this time they printed the book at their own press back in the @entity197 , making an inauspicious pocket - sized version			1
when bus - loads of @entity5 youth arrived at the conference in 1959 , @entity60 emigres stormed their vehicles and threw the books threw open windows			2
the passengers under @entity209 surveillance did n't know what to do with so many copies of the book readily available			0
surprisingly , the @entity209 officers at the conference were lenient			0
hit : @entity7 was nominated for @entity215 and remains one of the highest - grossing films of all time ' take it , read it , but by no means bring it home , ' the agents advised			0
@entity10 won the @entity224 for literature in 1958 , but was not allowed to travel to @entity226 to claim the award			2
he spent the rest of his life in @entity5 and died at the age of 70 in 1960			0
the 1965 film adaptation of the novel starring @entity162 and @entity163 went on to win five @entity233 , a nomination for best picture and remains one of the highest - grossing films of all time .			0
