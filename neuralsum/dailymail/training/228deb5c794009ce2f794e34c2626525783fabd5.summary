loft insulation may cut heating bills , but it is responsible for the decline of some of @entity6 ’s most loved birds , a report claims			1
by filling in gaps in roofs that leak heat , homeowners are unwittingly reducing the number of potential nesting spaces			0
the energy - saving practice has so far contributed to a decline in the number of sparrows and house martins , among other species			1
it says that sparrows living in urban and suburban areas have been affected the worst			0
@entity41 , a spokesman for the @entity29 , told the @entity42 : ‘ as people are becoming more aware and better at insulating their lofts they are inadvertently taking away little nooks and crannies which have historically been used by the sparrow to nest			2

’ the report claims that sparrow numbers have dropped by 70 per cent since the 1960s ( shown by this graph ) , while starling and house martin populations are half of what they were 40 years ago the report summarises population trends for 120 breeding bird species across @entity6 & @entity62 using data collected by volunteer surveyors			1
it provides habitat - specific trends for many species , highlighting those environments where species are in trouble			0
it says that many widespread and formerly common birds are experiencing severe declines , while targeted conservation is helping rare birds			0
a total of 28 species – a quarter of those surveyed – have suffered a fall in numbers of greater than 50 per cent over the last 35 - 45 years			1
as house martins also nest in holes , he believes they could have suffered because of insulation , as well as other factors such as less food at winter and people tidying up their gardens			2
mr @entity41 has recommended that people put up a nest box with a 32mm entrance as an alternative nesting space to holes in a roof			0
however , a lack of nesting sites does not explain why some bird species are struggling , because sparrows have also disappeared from areas with plenty of suitable sites			1
‘ this implies that other factors are probably involved , ’ mr @entity41 said			0
the report suggests that many birds may benefit from help , as it found that 28 species were have been in decline over the past 40 years , including skylarks and cuckoos			1
@entity109 , co-author of the report , said : ‘ the range of garden birds experiencing population declines appears to be increasing			2
’ as house martins also nest in holes constructed on ledges and nooks , the expert believes they could have suffered because of insulation , as well as other factors such as less food at winter ‘ while many will be familiar with the disappearance of house sparrow , starling and spotted flycatcher , it may surprise people to know that house martin , mistle thrush and greenfinch are heading in the same direction			1
‘ again , there is evidence that house martin and mistle thrush declines are most pronounced around human habitation			1
the @entity29 will be launching a volunteer house martin survey in spring 2015 to find out more about the current distribution of breeding populations			1
’ however , the population of 18 birds such as magpies and wood pigeons doubled over the period			1
mr @entity41 explained : ‘ because these birds are generalists and not tied to specific habitats it allows them breed over wider parts of the country and therefore they are doing much better			0
’ home owners can put up bird boxes to give sparrows and house martins places to nest , particularly if they have had their lofts insulated			0
@entity157 , a @entity158 at @entity29 said that more data is needed to help experts pinpoint specific problems and volunteers can help			0
so far , information generated by ringing birds and monitoring their nests has been used to find that the majority of farmland bird declines were driven by a reduction in food availability during the winter , while garden birds such as house starlings and greenfinches have been hit by a combination of reduced winter food availability and disease			0
@entity178 sparrows are struggling to rear enough chicks			0
‘ data gathered by @entity29 ringers and nest recorders will help us to identify the mechanisms underlying declines of other species , ’ he said .			2

@entity190 population has dropped by 70 *%* because of lack of nesting sites
loft insulation is also thought to have halved house martin populations
a total of 28 species living in @entity6 have been in decline over the past 40 years , including skylarks and cuckoos , but 18 have *flourished*
@entity29 ’s report says magpie population has doubled
