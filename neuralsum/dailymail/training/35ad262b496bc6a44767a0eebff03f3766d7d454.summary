by @entity0 published : 18:36 est , 8 october 2013 updated : 18:37 est , 8 october 2013 @entity3 executives have applied for around £ 500,000 of additional shares in the controversial flotation of the state - owned giant , it emerged last night			1
the applications – which include one from chief executive @entity8 – will receive ‘ priority ’ over other small investors clamouring to buy shares in the controversial privatisation			1
last night campaigners said it would be wrong if @entity3 ’s executives and the @entity16 were to make ‘ fat profits ’ if the demand for shares by small shareholders is scaled back			1
leading the charge : chief executive @entity8 will get a chunk of free shares like all other @entity3 workers despite having a pay package of £ 1.5million like all @entity3 workers , miss @entity8 will get a chunk of free shares , estimated to be worth around £ 2,000 for each worker			2
they could make an instant profit of more than £ 700 as the shares are set to rise sharply when conditional trading begins on the stock market on friday , possibly jumping from £ 3 to £ 4			1
but miss @entity8 and her ten fellow directors also want to buy shares in the flotation , according to the company ’s prospectus			0
buried on page 214 , it states : ‘ the directors have indicated to the company that they intend to make applications in the offer for an amount equal to , at least , approximately £ 500,000 , in aggregate			2
’ the executives will benefit from the same ‘ priority ’ given to @entity3 ’s workers when applying for shares and can apply for as many shares as they wish within the tranche that has been set aside for staff			1
if that part of the offer is oversubscribed then they will be subjected to a £ 10,000 limit			0
but the executives will be hoping that many of their lower paid staff will simply not have the financial resources to apply for more shares			0
the average postman working full - time earns a pay package of nearly £ 25,000 , while miss @entity8 enjoys a pay package of around £ 1.5million a year			0
dr @entity66 , of the @entity67 , which campaigns for the rights of small shareholders , warned he would be ‘ very disappointed ’ if they were over-looked			1
only 368 postmen out of a total of 150,000 plan to refuse free stocks he said : ‘ given this is the first positive sign of smaller investors getting a share in our economic growth , we would be very disappointed if their allocation were reduced significantly , or at all			0
’ business minister @entity83 has insisted small investors who want to buy shares in the privatisation will ‘ get their fair share ’			2
the government decided to set up an ‘ employee priority offer ’ , open to all workers , to encourage loyalty among its staff and to give them ‘ a share in the group ’s success			0
’ under the deal , they will pay the same price as other retail investors – between £ 2.60 and £ 3.30 per share – but will ‘ receive priority on up to the first £ 10,000 - worth of shares applied for ’			2
instant profits : @entity3 employers could stand to make more than £ 700 as sales are expected to rise sharply when trading begins on the stock market on friday the ‘ employee priority offer ’ will be capped at 10 per cent of the total number of shares allocated in the retail offer , which is 30 per cent of the total number			1
@entity115 , of the personal finance website @entity117 , said : ‘ while the @entity3 flotation could stand to make the @entity16 and @entity3 executives a fat profit , it is important that small investors do not get over-looked and end up having their share allocation scaled back			1
‘ the danger is that @entity122 gets scaled back , but the @entity16 and the executives do not suffer in the same way			1
’ @entity3 ’s eight non-executive directors , including the chairman @entity125 , have opted out of receiving free shares , deciding it was ‘ inappropriate ’ to accept them			1
but both the non-executive directors and the executive directors have subscribed for a total of £ 500,000 of shares in the company			0
the exact number of shares which they end up getting is expected to be published on friday when the share price is announced			0
the @entity3 prospectus states : ‘ the directors will not receive any priority application beyond that applicable to all eligible employees			2
’ to be eligible , a worker must have been employed by the company on july 10 and still be working for the firm at the time of the flotation			0
after five years , they can be sold tax - free .			0

employees could make as much as £ 700 as stocks are expected to rise sharply when trading begins on friday
but campaigners say it is wrong if @entity3 ’s executives made ‘ fat profits ’ if the demand for shares by small shareholders is scaled back
