these days , i am rarely surprised when , after a lecture or book signing , someone will try to talk to me about their addiction to porn and ask where he or she can get help			0
as an author and feminist social commentator , i often discuss my work at events and meet a wide spectrum of people who talk to me about sex , relationships and , more increasingly , the impact of pornography on their lives			1
there is no stereotype of what this person will look like			0
a man in his 60s has asked me if i think his porn addiction accounts for his current impotence			0
new survey : a major study has revealed that @entity32 couples are having about 20 % less sex than they did just ten years ago a lovely young mother of three boys asked sadly how her husband , in an otherwise happy , sexually fulfilled marriage , became ' lost to porn ' to the point that she had to leave him			1
she now wonders how to protect her sons			0
a bright , male college student confessed that he is worried about what he calls ' the kink spiral ' - the term he uses to describe feeling trapped by his need to see more and more extreme porn to get aroused			1
couples in their late teens tell me no one they know can have sex without porn playing on a screen			1
a guidance counsellor at a private school asks where he can find help for his students - many of whom are so addicted to online porn that the obsession is affecting their schoolwork and social development			1
recently , a major @entity32 study , the @entity63 , which questioned more than 15,000 people aged 16 to 74 , showed couples are having about 20 per cent less sex per month than they did just ten years ago			1
new discoveries : @entity70 's new book @entity68 : a new biography discusses how neuroscience shows how pornography negatively affects both sex and relationships as someone who has been researching in this field for over 20 years , i believe we must take seriously the rise of pornography			1
new research shows it is having a detrimental effect on men 's and women 's sexual responses and harming relationships as a consequence			1
my latest book , @entity89 : a new biography , about female sexual desire , has a chapter on new discoveries in neuroscience that show how pornography negatively affects both sex and relationships			1
popular culture is reflecting this trend : the new film @entity100 centres on porn addiction			0
the hero is sleeping with @entity103 but sneaks off to watch porn , since he says nothing with a real woman ( even @entity103 ! ) is as good			1
meanwhile , sex scenes in mainstream movies are getting more violent			1
in @entity109 , i was startled to see @entity111 's character start slapping her partner 's face as he neared orgasm			0
young women tell me that hair - pulling , and even pressure around the neck at orgasm , are normal parts of courtship sex these days			1
these are ' porn cliches ' , as one young woman put it			0
i am not surprised by these shifts because we all know about the pornification of society			0
i believe more voices would be speaking out if the new research on this issue were better understood			0
what we 're not being told - and this is a view which many scientists now confirm , but too few ordinary people understand - is that porn use poses health problems			1
mine is not a moral position			0
i think adults should be able see whatever they want in the privacy of their own homes ( if the images are not based on a crime or any cruelty being committed )			0
yet the neuroscience of porn addiction is clear : watching porn causes sharp spikes in the activation of dopamine , a neurotransmitter in the brain , which makes people feel focused , confident and good			0
the trouble is that this short - term neurological arousal has long - term consequences			1
firstly , it can cause desensitisation to the same erotic stimuli that turned you on recently and , over the longer term , it can cause a greater likelihood of sexual dysfunction			1
the user then craves more and more extreme pornography - violence and taboo images activate the autonomic nervous system , which is involved with arousal - in order to reach that same level of excitement			1
this acclimatisation and desensitisation explains why images that were seen as fetishistic , taboo or violent ten years ago are now mainstream fare on porn sites			1
a second effect , confirmed with men and anecdotal with women , is trouble reaching orgasm			1
doctors are now reporting an epidemic of healthy young and middle - aged men , with no disease or psychological issue that would otherwise explain their difficulties , who are having sexual problems such as impotence or delayed ejaculation due to this desensitisation			1
a final problem related to desensitisation is that men start to see their own partners as less attractive , and less able to arouse them by ordinary sexual behaviour			0
and , of course , one woman ca n't provide the ever - changing novelty , that constantly renewed boost to the brain that porn artificially delivers by a mouse click of the mouse			2
there are other ways porn use can negatively affect female arousal			0
if a woman feels uneasy about her partner 's use of porn the stress of her resentment and anger can affect her own ability to become aroused			0
if you understand the neuroscience of female arousal , women need to have their autonomic nervous systems ( heart rate , breathing , blood circulation ) highly activated to get turned on			0
emotions such as stress , anger , a sense of threat and resentment can function like throwing a bucket of freezing water on the female system			0
detrimental : @entity236 does not teach men sexual skills that are useful in arousing women i have also done a lot of research into the fact that sex portrayed in most porn does not teach men , especially young men , sexual skills that are useful in arousing women			1
as dr @entity250 , a pioneer in the field of the science of sexual behaviour from @entity256 's @entity255 , puts it , porn use can take an emotional toll on relationships because men who use it are ' neurologically bonding ' not with their partners , but with the porn			2
relationship expert and couples ' counsellor @entity265 says : ' couples are far more aware of porn now than they 've ever been			2
with everyone owning iphones and tablets and being constantly bombarded with sexy ads and imagery , porn is leaking into our lives and affecting our relationships			2
' when one partner watches surreptitiously , it 's a very dangerous avenue to go down			0
their imagination , and relationship , will be put at the mercy of fantasy			0
this often results in affairs			0
' a recent @entity289 study , in which two professors surveyed more than 800 men , found that excessive porn consumption was reported by almost half the respondents ( 85 per cent of whom were married or in a relationship ) , and was harming their professional success and relationships			2
the numbers were dramatic : 47 per cent of the male subjects watched between 30 minutes to three hours of porn per day , one in three said it harmed their work efforts , and one in five would rather watch porn than have sex with their partners			1
i can understand why the porn industry is keen to keep the addictive nature of its products quiet and promote the libertarian notion that there are no consequences			2
it is a global industry that wishes to turn men , and increasingly women , into addicts for financial reasons			0
the situation very much resembles the marketing of cigarettes without health warnings in the @entity324			2
so why is n't government - mandated disclosure of the risks obligatory , as it is now with cigarettes ? the answer is our politicians do n't yet fully understand the damage that is being done			2
less sexually liberated : @entity236 is taking over our thought processes and corroding our ability to sustain meaningful relationships recently , the @entity336 won a victory whereby the government agreed that all households should opt in if they want to be able to view porn on the internet			1
i believe that with good health information , people can make more informed choices about how , when , and if they want to use porn , and even better choices about what kind of imagery they might seek out or avoid			2
those who wish to end their addiction - like ending any addiction - can do so with effort			2
men who have done so - that is for whom we have data - report a great sense of regaining psychological control , and heightened arousal with their wives or girlfriends			2
mostly they are relieved not to be at the mercy of something that many of those who write to me feel they need - but do n't especially like			2
are we ' sexually liberated ' if porn is taking over our thought processes and corroding our ability to sustain meaningful relationships ? i think we are less sexually free			0
a powerful industry is manipulating us - and ruthlessly exploiting some hard - wiring in the male brain - to turn us more and more into sexual and emotional robots , only capable of achieving sexual fullfilment in a room with a computer , alone .			0

couples are having 20 % less sex than they did just ten years ago
@entity70 connects this to the rise of pornography
@entity236 poses health problems *...*
it desensitises those who watch it and has long - term consequences
as a result , it has a negative effect on sex and relationships
