by @entity1 reporter published : 10:17 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 10:41 est , 10 october 2012 dedicated @entity2 enjoys living in his sheltered housing accommodation so much that he has built this stunning miniature replica of the entire complex made out of empty whisky cartons and cornflakes boxes			1
the 75 - year - old has spent five hours a day over the last four years intricately constructing the scale model of the @entity11 sheltered housing complex in @entity12 where he has lived for the past 11 years			1
incredibly , the model - which is 5ft long and 3.5ft wide - only cost the patient pensioner a mere £ 30 to make			1
proud : resident @entity2 has created a six foot to one inch scale model of the @entity11 sheltered housing complex in @entity12 meticulous : @entity2 has spent four painstaking years building the model out of whisky carton and cereal boxes how much ? the total cost of the impressive model came to a paltry £ 30 @entity2 obtained the original blueprints for the building in 2008 and set about constructing the complex in painstaking detail			1
the model is accurate right down to the number of flagstones on pavements around the building and even includes a tiny 2cm model of @entity2 's beloved pet dog @entity35 outside his room			1
residents can gaze into miniature versions of their flats , and see tiny workmen fixing gutters - which are made of straws			0
@entity2 , a lifelong modeller who starting making scenery for his railway set as a child , said he decided to make the replica because he enjoyed living there so much			2
resemblance : @entity2 obtained the original plans for the complex so he could make his model as accurate as possible how it looks today : the fronts of the houses look remarkably alike , although the roofs on the model are red happy : the 75 - year - old said he loves living in the complex so much he ' just wanted to do something to commemorate the place ' yesterday the retired stationary shop worker , said : ' i 've done bits of scenery for my model railways over the years but never anything to this scale			1
' i just love living here so much that i wanted to do something to commemorate the place , which would last a long time			2
' maybe i will keep extending it out until i 've made an entire replica of @entity74			0
i might need a bigger house for that though			0
' i enjoyed making it as people used to come to watch me			0
the usual question was " have you made my flat yet ? ' or ' where is my flat going to be when you get round to doing it ? "			0
community : @entity2 even crafted small figures of people living in and visiting the complex as well as miniature cars labour of love : the mini version of @entity2 's home is complete with trees and gardens keeping the peace : an ambulance and police officers are on hand in @entity2 's model better than the real thing ? @entity2 , a retired stationery company rep , has lived in the complex for the past 11 years ' the building was made from @entity103 whisky cartons and the roof from cereal packets			1
the rest is stuff i have lying around			0
' the only things i have bought ready - made are the people and the vehicles			0
it 's only cost me about £ 30 in total			1
' this is my legacy to the place which will hopefully be around for a long time even when i 'm gone			0
' his local councillor @entity116 described @entity2 's model as a ' work of art , made from old rubbish			2
' she added : ' the level of detail really is amazing			0
' @entity12 's @entity124 have since donated a glass case to protect @entity2 's work which is on display for visitors to the sheltered accommodation .			2

@entity2 , 75 , spent just £ 30 building the impressive 5ft by 3.5ft model
pensioner said he loves his home so much he ' just wanted to do something to commemorate the place '
