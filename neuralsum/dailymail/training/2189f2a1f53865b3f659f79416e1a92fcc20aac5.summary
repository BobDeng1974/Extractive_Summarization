by @entity0 more than 650,000 passengers pass through @entity2 every day , making it by far the busiest in the @entity4 so when one @entity7 train bound for @entity8 pulled away from the station on saturday at 3pm , it was somewhat of a surprise that it managed to forget all of its passengers			1
the @entity13 departed as passengers were waiting at a completely different platform after being given the wrong information			2
the driver apparently left without getting permission from the station			1
feeling a bit light : the @entity13 ( file picture ) departed with no passengers while everyone was waiting on another platform when they realised what had happened , passengers took to @entity27 to vent their frustration			1
