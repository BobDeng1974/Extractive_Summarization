it all started for @entity1 , like so many young @entity3 fans , after one unforgettable night in @entity4 10 years ago			1
he was only nine then and , growing up in @entity5 , @entity6 , his fledgling football affinity had been towards @entity8			1
but on may 25 , 2005 , young @entity1 was given a treat			1
though it was a school night , he was given permission to stay up and watch the @entity13 final			1
@entity3 's @entity1 and @entity15 ' @entity14 ( left ) battle for the ball during the @entity19 clash that night in @entity4 is one etched on the mind of young @entity1 , as he opted to support the club after watching it it turned out , of course , to be a game like no other and as @entity26 inspired that stunning comeback against @entity28 , a dream took flight in the @entity1 household			1
‘ @entity33 was a @entity3 fan , ’ says @entity1 , taking up the story			1
‘ growing up i supported @entity8 a little bit but i ’ve been a @entity3 fan since i started watching the games			1
i watched the @entity13 final in the evening			1
i was n’t [ normally ] allowed to stay up but i watched it			0
’ what separates @entity1 from other @entity3 fans of his age , however , is that when the club returns to the @entity41 on thursday to tackle @entity15 , he will be out on the pitch aiming to show why he is considered one of the hottest young talents in @entity46 football			1
@entity47 battles for the ball with @entity1 during the @entity19 match at @entity50 on thursday @entity51 keeps out @entity53 's penalty to hand @entity3 their fifth @entity13 his emergence over the past month , which has featured exciting displays against @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity15 , has been as swift as one of those rapid bursts down the right flank he can produce , and the hopes @entity61 has for this confident 19 - year - old are understandably high			1
@entity3 did not look to make signings during the january transfer window but one move @entity61 wanted above all was bringing @entity1 back from a successful loan spell at @entity68			1
having watched his progress , @entity61 firmly believed he could influence their aggressive pursuit of a top four spot			0
‘ i am enjoying it and it ’s good for the gaffer to get me involved and hopefully i can get a few more chances to play , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ my @entity33 is proud and the whole family are proud			0
i enjoyed it at @entity68			0
i made a lot of friends			2
the team was great and i was playing all the time [ he made 24 appearances ]			0
@entity1 battles to get past @entity15 player @entity14 during @entity3 's @entity19 clash with @entity15 ‘ @entity84 is a good manager , definitely a great coach on the training ground			1
he always helped me and the young players			0
i enjoyed my time with him			0
so [ when i heard @entity3 wanted me back ] i was thinking to myself , “ was i going to come back and not play ? ” ‘ but it was a confidence booster because i had been doing well and he [ @entity61 ] asked me to come back			2
it ’s given me confidence to join in with the first team and try to prove myself			0
i have done well and i am enjoying my football			2
there may have been early disappointment in his career , when he was released by @entity94 as a 12 - year - old , but going to @entity96 — where @entity97 gave him a @entity99 debut at 15 — set him on the road to the @entity102			0
@entity103 turns on the @entity105 samba skills at @entity50 as @entity3 beat @entity15 in the first leg after just 11 appearances , @entity3 signed him for £ 500,000 on january 1 2012 and he developed in their @entity108 before @entity61 handed him a debut against @entity110 just over 16 months later — his pass allowed @entity103 to score the goal that sent @entity113 into retirement with a 1 - 0 win			2
‘ i thought it was the right time for me to move away from home , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ i had a trial at @entity119 when i was younger but this was a good choice for me			0
it was a bit difficult when i was a bit younger but as i was leaving secondary school i thought it was the right choice			0
‘ my family moved up with me and it ’s been great ever since			0
i have n’t been homesick at all and i had education when i was in the youth team , so everything has been cool and i have made friends at the club			0
@entity103 and @entity133 collide during the @entity19 clash between @entity3 and @entity15 ‘ i ’m learning from the attacking players like @entity136 [ @entity137 ] , @entity138 [ @entity139 ] , [ @entity141 ] @entity140 and @entity103 , and i ’m trying to add goals to my game and prove to the manager i can keep playing			1
wing - back is a new position for me but it ’s good because i can attack the [ opposition ] full - @entity150 has been a really big influence			0
he has been helping me and we talk off the pitch and he gives me advice			0
‘ he is a year older than me and it gives me a lot of confidence to try and achieve what he has achieved at such a young age			2
@entity136 is another person who has helped me on and off the pitch			0
’ comparisons with @entity139 are understandable , given their respective pace and frames , but @entity1 , while taking inspiration from how his friend has developed , is his own man and is determined to take this opportunity to carve out a niche for himself in the team			1
@entity3 have already taken steps to secure him for the long term by offering him new , improved terms — his current deal runs until 2017 — and their ambitions for him are mirrored within the @entity174 , as @entity176 head coach @entity175 watched him against @entity15 last thursday			2
@entity140 in action during the @entity19 round of 32 match between @entity3 and @entity15 the fallout from that game was consumed by @entity137 ’s penalty but it was @entity1 ’s thrilling change of gear that tempted @entity47 to make a misguided lunge for the ball , thus setting up another thrilling night in the @entity41			1
this time @entity1 will be able to shape @entity3 ’s destiny			1
‘ the manager has also given me the chance to play in big stadiums in front of big grounds , ’ says @entity1			2
‘ so when i play at @entity50 i have that confidence and there are great players around me as well , which helps			0
i just want to keep progressing and see from there			0
’ @entity139 , @entity137 and @entity140 line up in a wall as they look to block a free kick on thursday			1

@entity1 became a @entity3 fan after the @entity13 final
growing up in @entity5 his football affinity had been towards @entity8
@entity1 has been *impressive* since breaking onto the scene this *season*
he admits he is learning a lot from @entity139 and @entity140
