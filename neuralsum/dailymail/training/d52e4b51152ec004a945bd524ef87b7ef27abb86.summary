a fatwa has been issued against living on @entity2 by clerics who say that trying to set up home there would be un-islamic			1
the fatwa – or ruling – was issued by the @entity8 ( @entity9 ) in the @entity10 after the @entity12 organisation announced that it would try and establish a permanent human settlement on @entity2			1
the committee argued that an attempt to dwell on the planet would be so hazardous as to be suicidal and killing oneself is not permitted by @entity18			1
forbidden : a fatwa has been issued against travelling to @entity2 ( above is a @entity22 image of the @entity2 ) according to @entity24 it said : ‘ such a one - way journey poses a real risk to life , and that can never be justified in @entity18			1
there is a possibility that an individual who travels to planet @entity2 may not be able to remain alive there , and is more vulnerable to death			2
’ the astronauts , the committee said , would end up dying for no ‘ righteous reason ’ and would face the same punishment in the afterlife as someone who ’d committed suicide			0
the committee , led by professor dr @entity42 , said : ‘ protecting life against all possible dangers and keeping it safe is an issue agreed upon by all religions and is clearly stipulated in verse 4/29 of the @entity48 : do not kill yourselves or one another			2
indeed , @entity51 is to you ever merciful			0
’ however , @entity12 pointed out that the @entity48 encourages exploration			1
in a written response to the @entity55 it highlighted a verse that says ' and among his signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth , and the variations in your languages and your colors : verily in that are signs for those who know ( @entity48 30 : 22 ) '			2
it said : ' the @entity70 world has a rich tradition of exploration			1
the verse from the @entity48 above encourages @entity70 to go out and see the signs of @entity76 ’s creation in the " heavens and the earth "			2
the most influential example of this was the @entity81 @entity70 traveller @entity82 , who from 1325 to 1355 travelled 73,000 miles , visiting the equivalent of 44 modern countries			0
' @entity12 also disputed that the mission was tantamount to suicide			1
the organisation said : ' space exploration , just like @entity91 exploration , will come with risks and rewards			0
it may seem extremely dangerous to send humans to @entity2 today , but the humans will be preceded by at least eight cargo missions			2
' robotic unmanned vehicles will prepare the habitable settlement			0
water and a breathable atmosphere will be produced inside the habitat and the settlement will be operational for two years , even before the first crew leaves @entity91			0
' if we may be so bold : the @entity9 should not analyze the risk as they perceive it today			0
the @entity9 should assess the potential risk for humans as if an unmanned habitable outpost is ready and waiting on @entity2			2
' it added : ' @entity12 respectfully requests @entity9 to cancel the @entity55 and make the greatest @entity110 , or journey , of all times open for @entity70 , too			2
they can be the first @entity70 to witness the signs of @entity76 ’s creation in heaven , drawing upon the rich culture of travel and exploration of early @entity18			1
' the lives and journey of the first @entity2 settlers will tell us more about our place in the universe than any other humans before us			0
as @entity82 also wrote : " travelling - it leaves you speechless , then turns you into a storyteller			0
" ' the @entity9 has issued around two million fatwas through its @entity131 since its inception in 2008			0
colony : @entity12 hopes to establish a human colony on the @entity2 by 2025 the multi-billion pound @entity2 one mission hopes to establish a human colony on @entity2 in 2025			1
over 200,000 people , including 500 @entity140 and @entity141 , have applied to take part in the missions so far			1
in december @entity12 short - listed 1,058 people to take part in trials for the ambitious project			1
co-founder @entity148 said : ‘ we ’re extremely appreciative and impressed with the sheer number of people who submitted their applications			0
' however , the challenge with 200,000 applicants is separating those who we feel are physically and mentally adept to become human ambassadors on @entity2 from those who are obviously taking the mission much less seriously			1
we even had a couple of applicants submit their videos in the nude ! ’ @entity2 lies on average 141.6million miles from the @entity163 and has an average temperature of @entity165 ( -65c )			0
its atmosphere is desperately thin - one per cent of @entity91 's pressure - and is 95 per cent carbon dioxide .			0

clerics in the @entity10 have deemed a colony on @entity2 as being un-islamic
they argue that trying to live there would be akin to committing suicide
killing oneself is *strictly* forbidden in @entity18 , according to the @entity48
the ruling came after @entity12 announced a 2025 mission to @entity2
so far around 500 @entity140 and @entity141 have *volunteered* to take part in it
@entity12 pointed out that @entity18 has a rich tradition of exploration
