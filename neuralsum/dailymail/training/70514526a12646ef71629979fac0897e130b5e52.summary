@entity0 becomes new @entity2 boss as @entity3 thrash out £ 2million compensation deal with @entity2 in a bid to outwit the camera crews and photographers jostling at the main entrance to @entity3 ’s first - team base , a man in a purple @entity12 cap and black leather jacket slipped across half a mile of training pitches and left via the club ’s academy for one final time			1
that walk , with only the @entity20 greenery for company , would have been his most peaceful 10 minutes of an otherwise frenzied and exhausting 48 hours			1
for @entity0 — successfully dodging the press in his @entity12 disguise — has been on the back page of every newspaper and the lead item of every sports bulletin since the shock news broke of his decision to quit @entity3 for @entity2 on sunday night			1
he has since been in meetings negotiating his release and the separation , it is thought , is amicable			0
@entity0 has said his goodbyes to the players and staff at @entity3 ahead of his @entity2 move @entity38 ( left ) and @entity39 leave @entity3 's training ground after @entity0 returned to say goodbye on tuesday , he said his goodbyes			1
after four years , it is the end			0
he will leave his @entity44 home for the last time on wednesday in the direction of south east @entity46 , where a £ 2million salary and a £ 1m bonus for @entity50 survival awaits			0
but for @entity3 , it is another beginning			1
on tuesday , caretaker boss @entity52 addressed @entity3 ’s senior players			1
the mood is good , they are saddened but accepting of @entity0 ’s choice			1
one point of relief and levity were the reports — strongly denied by the club — that skipper @entity61 was set to be appointed manager			2
his team - mates are already calling him ‘ gaffer ’			2
such is the nature of a footballer ’s existence , they move on			0
talk on @entity20 and in the dressing - room has turned to his replacement			1
@entity3 captain @entity61 arrives at training , while @entity71 ( right ) gives a thumbs up there have been reports , strongly denied by the club , that @entity61 was set to be appointed manager @entity52 and coach @entity77 — unaware of @entity0 ’s defection until monday — will get the chance to impress over the next two matches , a home game with @entity82 and the @entity83 tie at @entity84			1
@entity52 , a @entity85 and disciple of sir @entity87 , would love to manage his hometown club			0
as would two other natives of the @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92			2
contact , meanwhile , has been made with @entity93			2
he , however , was unhappy with some of the terms being floated			0
and that , says former @entity3 favourite @entity96 , is why @entity0 ’s successor must enter the role having already ceded some control to a hierarchy who identify signings			1
‘ it ’s no good going into the job if you think you ’re going to get the opportunity to do your own thing , ’ he told @entity104			0
@entity52 and @entity77 will get the chance to impress over the next two matches , a home game with @entity82 and the @entity83 tie at @entity84 all was quiet at @entity2 's @entity113 training on tuesday , with no @entity0 announcement imminent ‘ that ’s why i think @entity0 did a very good job			1
some fans think he was just a puppet for @entity120			2
but how many of us would go storming into our boss ’s office shouting the odds if we were n’t happy about something ? ‘ he was good at playing that role and was a politician at times			2
he was there for four years but i think he ’d had enough – enough of some of the conditions he worked under and enough of some of the abuse from fans			0
i thought it was a disgrace when it affected his family			0
‘ so part of me thinks , “ you know what , @entity0 , good on you ”			2
some people think things are going to suddenly change at the club because he ’s gone and i understand some of the reasons why a lot of fans did n’t like him			0
but , for me , he did a good job and that might be realised in time			0
’ former @entity152 boss @entity151 is currently in the frame for the @entity155 job and @entity96 is right			1
@entity0 leaving does not herald a brilliant new dawn at @entity155			1
yes , there is the chance for a new man to inject new ideas , but he will still be @entity120 ’s man , a point which some supporters always held against @entity0			1
the owner , says @entity96 , will reveal a lot about his aspirations for the club with this appointment			0
‘ it will be interesting to see who he gets , ’ said the former @entity170 defender			0
‘ it will either show great ambition to go out and pay money for a high - profile name , or it could be an appointment which does n’t excite the fans or capture the imagination			0
‘ looking at the list of names linked so far there is no - one really who stands out who ’d you ’d say , “ yes , get him ”			0
’ perhaps that is why @entity3 will take their time			2
any unveiling is not expected until next week at the earliest but work is underway to draw up a shortlist , hence the early contact with @entity93 ’s people			2
@entity3 legend @entity96 would like to see @entity193 ( left ) given a chance @entity96 , though , is championing two of his former team - mates , @entity71 and @entity193			1
‘ i do n’t think it ’s a bad idea at all to promote @entity71 from the under - 21s and give him until the end of the season , ’ he said			1
‘ if it was from the outside then i ’d say @entity151 and @entity193 as his assistant would appeal to fans			0
@entity0 played more than 100 games for @entity2 during a four - year spell at the south @entity46 club ‘ @entity151 was pretty outspoken at @entity152 but he might have learnt his lesson – he ’d have to if he was going to work here			1
but he ’s got an ace card in @entity211 and that could work			0
’ making things work is what it ’s all about as manager of @entity3			1
but , after four years , he ’d had enough			0
now it ’s the turn of someone else to play @entity219 mediator – they best bring a cap and leather jacket just in case it does n’t work out .			0
