by @entity0 published : 10:12 est , 27 august 2013 updated : 19:54 est , 27 august 2013 ' depraved ' : @entity1 , of @entity2 , was jailed for life in 2011 for twice raping a child in a nursery a nursery teacher raped a girl of three after authorities ignored ‘ obvious ’ warning signs that he was a danger to children , a scathing report has found			1
@entity1 , 23 , was free to abuse the child despite staff repeatedly warning @entity15 and the local council that he had developed a ‘ special relationship ’ with her			1
a serious case review found that the little girl had been ‘ failed by those responsible for caring for her ’			1
criminal record checks were not carried out properly before he was given the job at the @entity26 in @entity27 , @entity2 , which his mother used to manage			2
she left before he started			0
nursery staff alerted authorities again and again to the fact that @entity1 was developing a ‘ special relationship ’ with the girl			1
@entity1 took a particular interest in the child , and was seen cuddling and rocking her for hours , refusing to leave her			2
concerned nursery staff told authorities he had been seen taking the child into an adult toilet alone and , on one occasion , had been found alone with her in the sleep area of the nursery , with the child hysterically crying : ‘ i want my mummy			1
’ yet despite several warnings over 18 months , neither the council nor @entity15 launched a proper investigation			2
the review was carried out by @entity2 ’s @entity53			1
it said the authorities had been so lax in dealing with the situation that @entity1 would almost certainly have got away with the abuse had he not come to the attention of police separately when a 13 - year - old girl reported @entity1 for grooming her online			1
when officers checked his mobile phone they discovered videos of two attacks on the toddler			0
failures : a serious case review said staff at @entity72 nursery knew of concerns about @entity1 's behaviour but failed to act the case is the latest in a series of catastrophic child protection failures by the children ’s services department of @entity82 - run @entity80 , which has been rated ‘ inadequate ’ for the past four years			1
high profile cases include that of seven - year - old @entity85 , who was starved to death in 2008			0
in may , the department was described as being in ‘ utter chaos ’ by members of its own watchdog			0
the review found the council and @entity15 both missed ‘ obvious pointers ’ that @entity1 was a paedophile and ‘ missed opportunities to intervene ’			1
their inaction had ‘ supported ’ his offences , it said			0
questions : the report said among the failings was a lack of supervision and poor management of the nursery ( pictured ) @entity1 started work at the nursery in 2008			1
in november the following year , a few months after the toddler joined , a student teacher on placement at the nursery reported @entity1 to her college and the council for ‘ inappropriate behaviour ’			1
two further complaints were made over the following year , but again nothing was done			0
the ‘ manipulative ’ @entity1 was so confident he would not get caught he even filed his own complaint about ‘ safeguarding issues ’ at the nursery			2
he was not pursued about the allegations against him , it was suggested , because he was a male teacher , and staff were anxious not to make him feel singled out			0
jailed : @entity1 was originally sentenced to life with a minimum of 15 years but this was cut by 18 months following an appeal @entity1 was eventually caught because of the bravery of the 13 - year - old girl he had groomed online , one of 22 other victims all aged between 12 and 16			1
once he had gained their trust , @entity1 would get them to commit sexual acts which he recorded on webcams before threatening to show the images to their family if they spoke out			2
in 2011 @entity1 was jailed for life for raping the child , grooming 22 other girls and for more than 40 offences related to grooming young girls on the internet and distributing indecent images			1
the judge described him as ‘ chilling , vile and depraved ’			0
@entity1 , who pleaded guilty , was originally sentenced to serve at least 15 years of a life sentence			2
but he has since had his minimum term reduced to 13 - and - a - half years to encourage other paedophiles to admit their crimes			0
@entity153 , chairman of the @entity53 , said : ‘ there were unfortunately a number of weaknesses in the way that nursery was run and a number of opportunities to intervene earlier and prevent the continuation of abuse which were missed			0
‘ there were obvious pointers that should have raised the alarm , yet both @entity15 and the local authority failed to recognise them and respond appropriately			0
’ no staff members at @entity80 were sacked or disciplined after the case			0
a council spokesman said it was ‘ sorry ’ about the failures , but added : ‘ the first responsibility must sit with the perpetrator and with the nursery which had a responsibility for checking and supervising			0
‘ the council had a responsibility in terms of responding to reports of @entity1 ’s behaviour rather than preventing it			2
‘ [ the council ] fully acknowledges that a referral to us was not followed through and that this meant that @entity1 was able to continue undetected for a longer period			0
’ an @entity15 spokesman said : ‘ we very much regret that our inspection regime did not help to stop this dangerous and manipulative child abuser sooner			1

@entity1 , then aged *21* , jailed for life in 2011 for twice raping an *infant*
police found paedophile had also been grooming at least 20 girls online
staff at @entity203 nursery in @entity2 warned about his behaviour
serious case review says poor inspections ' supported ' @entity1 's offending
@entity15 admits it ' very much regrets that we did not stop @entity1 sooner '
