by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 prowled the turf in the searing @entity5 heat inspecting his @entity7 squad through his sunglasses , evoking the lyrics of @entity10 who claimed the future was so bright they had to wear shades			1
@entity2 fitted neatly into the role of the ‘ crazy teacher who wears dark glasses ’ and his players were the pupils ‘ who love their classes ’			2
things were going great , although the most eye - catching among those players was undoubtedly @entity24 , who can not play against @entity25 because he was sent off against @entity26 on wednesday			1
he looked fantastic , free from concern over the red card and how it may affect his chances of featuring in the @entity65 finals			2
@entity2 has shrugged it off , too			2
the @entity7 boss planned to play him from the start against @entity25			1
‘ i even held him back a bit on wednesday , ’ he said			0
‘ as you can imagine he was absolutely gutted to be sent off , as were we			0
‘ but he does n’t seem to have taken it to heart			0
the most important thing is he ’s still making me aware he ’s a player who can inflict an awful lot of damage on the opposition			0
he is an exceptional talent , along with our other exceptional talents			0
i do n’t need to see a performance from him on the field to know he ’s capable of playing in the @entity85 game if selected			2
’ keeping an eye on things : @entity2 and @entity88 watch training as @entity45 takes a break cool customer : @entity92 puts a towel over his face to keep cool during training take a break : @entity97 and @entity42 sit down during a break in training heated battle : @entity101 and @entity103 fight for the ball hitting the deck : @entity106 goes down under the challenge of @entity92 watching on : @entity108 watches the training session from the sidelines @entity24 scored one solo goal , which started with an audacious overhead backheel in midfield by @entity114			1
it was that kind of session and the local soccer fans invited to watch were impressed			0
captain @entity30 agreed @entity24 had been the ‘ best player ’ in training			1
‘ straight away after the red card i spoke to him in the dressing room and told him it was important to put himself back in the frame for @entity85 , ’ said @entity30			1
warming up : the @entity7 goalkeepers , @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127 warm up alongside coach @entity128 respect : a wreath stands by the training pitch to mark the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings safe hands : @entity125 makes a save during training as it stands , @entity7 have a happy camp			1
@entity30 , all smiles and dry one - liners in his press briefing , said the mood was far more confident than it was four years ago in @entity144 under @entity145			1
and @entity2 is revelling in the emergence of so many young and exciting players			2
besides @entity24 , @entity92 looked impressive training at @entity60 , who are famed for their soccer team — aptly known as the @entity151			1
‘ it gives you that headache all coaches say they want , ’ said the manager , as he briefed the media in a room called @entity155 and stressed the need for 14 - man games at the @entity65 in @entity158 , with substitutions more important than ever			0
hot , hot heat : the @entity7 players feel the heat in @entity5 during training leading by example : @entity30 is put through his paces during training ‘ you do n’t just have 11 players , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ you have players who are forcing their way into the team and will divide opinion			2
my favoured xi for @entity85 might divide opinion			0
that ’s good for a start			0
it ’ll give us enormous opportunities on the bench to change things around			0
‘ it ’s going to be hot and most teams wo n’t be able to get through three 90 - minute games with the same team			0
i have the opportunity to make changes			0
it ’s definitely going to be a 14 - man game			2
you wo n’t see too many teams starting with 11 and finishing with 11 , and you ’ll see teams changing game to game as long as they have the depth to do that			2
’ @entity7 feel they have and @entity2 ’s squad has been selected specifically with a view to using players for impact from the bench			1
despite @entity24 ’s flair in training , his most likely role against @entity85 in @entity205 on june 14 will probably be as a sub			1
the teenager has the ability to tear through teams if they are drained of strength near the end of a game in humid conditions			2
local interest : the people of @entity5 turn out to watch training at @entity60 possession game : @entity42 wins the ball from @entity92 during training ‘ we ’ve got impact players , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ we ’ve spoken a lot about @entity24 and it ’s a pity he ca n’t play			1
@entity45 is another you could put into that category			0
’ compared to @entity7 , @entity85 are trudging towards @entity205 , without a win since september and unable to beat @entity229 on wednesday			1
‘ they ’re due a win are n’t they , ’ said @entity30 with a smile			1
‘ be careful of going down that route , ’ added @entity2 , drawing on his experience at @entity235			0
‘ i ’ve worked in @entity85			0
they have a much healthier attitude to warm - up games			0
it does n’t bother them			0
’ @entity2 ’s team will expect another work - out in the tropical heat against a hard - working @entity245 team cheered on by a crowd of 40,000 , largely made up of @entity247 who live in @entity249			0
it will be hot and intense inside a stadium where there is no shade			0
not unless the @entity7 boss is sporting his again			1
@entity256 and old : @entity106 and @entity24 compete for the ball			1

@entity7 players train at @entity60 in @entity5 ahead of @entity25 game
@entity24 looked sharp during training despite not being able to play
@entity30 says @entity7 squad is a happy place and full of confidence
