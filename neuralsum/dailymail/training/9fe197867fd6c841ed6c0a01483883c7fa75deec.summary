@entity0 called it , when he said @entity2 were his dark horses for the @entity4			1
praise from an unlikely source given he was manager of their bitter rivals @entity5 less than three years ago			0
recent history would suggest @entity0 is wrong - they have exited the competition at the last - 16 stage in their previous four seasons - but @entity2 appear poised to amount a serious assault on one of the few trophies to elude manager @entity19 during his 18 years at the club			1
@entity2 players celebrate during the 2 - 1 win against @entity23 at @entity24 on saturday @entity19 's side appear to be mounting a serious challenge for the @entity4 this season @entity27 celebrates @entity2 's victory over @entity23 in his underwear with his team - mates @entity31 like a nervous - yet - primed 100m sprinter , @entity2 have uncurled from their delayed push out of the starting blocks and are starting to open out and power towards the finish line			1
perfect timing for a @entity4 charge			2
they have won 10 of their last 12 matches in all competitions and are on a run of nine straight home wins , which began back in november			0
hitting form has coincided with @entity46 netting eight in his past 11 games , taking some of the pressure off free - scoring @entity27			1
@entity50 striker @entity46 has scored eight goals in his past 11 games for the @entity53 @entity54 back in february 2013 , sir @entity55 surprised many when he included @entity57 , facing a difficult second season after breaking into the @entity60 first team and up until that point have only scored once , to face @entity62 at the @entity63 in the first leg of their knockout double header			1
he upstaged @entity67 after scoring early on from his team - mate ’s corner in a 1 - 1 draw			0
@entity55 said afterwards : ‘ they found it difficult to handle him			0
’ his work - rate , which often comes at the detriment to goals , should not be underestimated and could prove crucial in key @entity4 ties			1
@entity57 ( right ) should not be underestimated and his work - rate could prove crucial in @entity77 @entity78 @entity2 only finished runners - up in their group and could have faced @entity81 , @entity62 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 or @entity85			1
the @entity50 @entity87 side are arguably the easiest draw of the lot			0
@entity90 , @entity91 and @entity60 have all demonstrated in previous years that a sprinkle of the magic stuff can help to win the competition			0
it takes monumental comebacks , penalty shootout victories or sometimes two goals deep into stoppage - time to win @entity77 ’s greatest club competition			2
drawing @entity82 could be the bit of luck @entity2 need			1
drawing @entity82 and @entity103 could be the bit of luck @entity2 need to progress to the quarter - finals @entity107 - a - hoop @entity19 has been delighted with the emergence of defensive midfielder @entity109 from exiled to exceptional			1
he appeared on his way out of the club until a spate of injuries forced @entity19 ’s hand			2
@entity109 has excelled , mopping up in front of the back four			0
@entity2 have so many midfield options , but the problem is none of them want to defend and @entity109 is the enforcer they were so badly lacking			2
he was offered a new contract in january , which he signed this month			0
' i saw that he made huge improvements in training so i sent him on loan for match practice , ’ @entity19 said			2
‘ he took that challenge and he 's done very well			0
he is a long - term solution			0
’ @entity109 ( right ) has been a revelation for @entity2 in recent weeks and is seen as a long - term solution @entity130 fourteen players have missed chunks of this season with injuries this season			1
that ’s almost an entire starting xi and substitutes bench			0
and most of them have been first - team players			0
they ’ll have to get a revolving door installed in the treatment room fairly soon if this continues			0
but key players are returning and the pressure is easing on the final run - in			2
@entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151 are all on their way back and @entity153 is playing again after a year out			1
they have also missed the likes of @entity156 , @entity46 and @entity157 who are now back to full fitness			2
@entity149 is back training again while @entity153 is playing after a year out through injury			1

@entity2 have exited the @entity4 in last - 16 in last four seasons
