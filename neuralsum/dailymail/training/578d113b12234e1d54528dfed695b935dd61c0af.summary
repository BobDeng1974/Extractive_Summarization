by @entity0 we might think of quirky fruit beers made in small , independent breweries as a modern trend			2
but in fact the practice goes back 9,000 years when high - ranking cavemen drank brews which included fruit and strange ingredients such as pine resin			1
unlike in modern times , alcohol was considered to be sacred and was used in ritual ceremonies , new research suggests			1
hold the glasses : alcohol was considered to be sacred and were used in ritual ceremonies , new research suggests			1
fossils and skeletons revealed evidence that elite people drank fruit wines , mead and beer made with barley and oats , much like the pints we consume today ( pictured ) alcoholic residues suggest that ancient @entity30 drank fruity wines , beer made from barley and wheat and mead			1
they also consumed fermented drinks made from dairy products			0
the making of alcohol seems to originate in @entity40 in around @entity41			0
people living in the @entity43 of north - western @entity44 were drinking wine made with pine resin in @entity47			1
scientists have discovered a professional winery in south - eastern @entity50 dating from @entity51			1
experts think that the wine was made for mortuary practices as there were 20 graves and a number of cups unearthed nearby			2
dr @entity58 thinks that alcohol and drugs were only used by people of high social standing in the vast region			2
fossils and skeletons revealed evidence that elite people drank fruit wines and beer			1
@entity69 , a prehistory expert at the @entity70 in @entity71 told @entity72 that the archaeological record of prehistoric @entity74 shows that people used mind - altering substances			1
as well as historical accounts by ancient @entity81 writers , archaeologists have found macrofossil remains with mind - altering properties and some designs in tombs could have been inspired by altered states of consciousness			2
dr @entity58 looked at macrofossil remains of psychoactive plants , residue from fermented alcoholic drinks , chemical compounds left on skeletons and artwork showing drinking scenes in a bid to piece together how alcohol and drugs were used in @entity98 prehistory			2
alcoholic residues suggest that ancient @entity30 drank fruity wines , beer made from barley and wheat and mead			1

while the making of alcohol seems to originate in @entity40 in around @entity41 , 2,000 years later , people living in the @entity43 of north - western @entity44 were drinking wine made with pine resin			1
and scientists have discovered a professional winery in south - eastern @entity50 dating from @entity51			1
experts think that the wine was made for mortuary practices as there were 20 graves and a number of cups unearthed nearby			0
some pottery fragments contained residues of beer and wine from burial sites and settlements			0
high ranking people in ancient @entity30 occasionally drank to excess			0
alcohol and drugs were considered to be sacred and were used in ritual ceremonies , new research suggests			1
here , a figurine known as the ' @entity133 ' ( centre ) is thought to have been used in the taking of opium dr @entity58 said : ‘ many tombs have provided traces of alcoholic drinks and drugs			0
i think these substances were used to aid in communication with the spirit world			0
’ some artworks , such as a figurine known as the ‘ @entity133 ’ show that drugs were also used ceremonially			0
the figurine was found in a chamber in @entity148 thought to have been used by cult members			0
she has three moveable hairpins shaped like poppy capsules , which hint at how opium might have been extracted by people			0
her serene expression suggests the trance - like state ancient people may have entered into by inhaling opium fumes			0
dr @entity58 thinks that alcohol and drugs were only used by people of high social standing in the vast region			0
‘ the main evidence to support that idea is the archaeological contexts where they have been found : tombs of high - status individuals and restricted ceremonial places , ’ she said			2
‘ i think that prior to a large - scale production , alcoholic drinks were reserved for special events and they played a similar role as drug plants			0
’ but as larger scale wineries and breweries became more common , alcohol found its way into the hands of average people , who largely used it for hedonistic rather than ritualistic purposes .			1

alcohol was considered to be sacred and was used in ritual ceremonies
an expert at the @entity70 in @entity71 found evidence that elite people drank fruit wines and beer from @entity191 *onwards*
in @entity194 @entity44 people were drinking wine made with pine resin and there were wineries in south - eastern @entity50 dating in @entity199
