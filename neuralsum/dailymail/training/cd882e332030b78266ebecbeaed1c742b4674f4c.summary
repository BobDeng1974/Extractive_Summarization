astrobiologist @entity0 of the @entity1 at @entity2 has designed a software package that can draw real - looking worlds based on the scientific data we receive from space telescopes - and says @entity8 gets it wrong			1
@entity0 's software package draws planets based on their size , distance from their parent star and chemistry - and can create 3d images that correspond to the data			1
the imagery sent out when missions such as @entity8 's kepler telescope find ' exoplanets ' - planets outside our solar system - is still imagined by artists			0
@entity0 claims that his approach is more scientific			0
a warm , earthlike planet orbiting a red dwarf star			2
@entity0 's software lets astronomers enter the data they know about a planet and then constructs a vision of what it might look like a small , cold planet as recreated by @entity0 's software			1
he says that @entity8 's imaginings of planets may not always be accurate @entity38 rendered 240 million years ago - when the continents were still gathered together into the ' supercontinent ' named @entity41 the @entity42 is designed to generate ' photo - real ' images of other planets - and ' draws ' its reconstructions using data such as chemicals detected by space telescopes and their size and surface temperature			1
unlike ' artists reconstructions ' , it 's all done mathematically			0
@entity0 said of @entity8 's reconstruction of kepler 22 - b , ' i think that the @entity8 image got the color right but i do nâ€™t expect clouds like that			0
it probably will be more featureless like @entity60 or @entity61 and not so good for a press release			0
' @entity0 's software is specially designed to reconstruct @entity38 - like exoplanets , either rocky or ocean in nature , but it is also able to generate visuals for gas giants and stars			1
it includes the reconstruction of realistic clouds and weather effects			0
a warm world larger than our @entity38			2
unlike ' artist 's renderings ' of planets , @entity0 's software ' creates worlds ' based on available scientific information a hot exoplanet about the size of @entity84 the software can also be used to construct 3d models of planets for research and simulations			1
the software is now in an alpha ' test ' version , but will be released next year .			2

first software that ' renders ' 3d worlds based on what we know
draws worlds based on their size , chemistry and distance from star
can render our @entity38 from *historical* data
