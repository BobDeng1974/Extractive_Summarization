by @entity0 @entity1 : 18:41 est , 26 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:25 est , 26 december 2013 routine hospital appointments for cancer survivors should be scrapped to prevent the @entity5 being overwhelmed by demand , according to a leading charity			2
@entity8 said the current system whereby most patients recovering from the disease are automatically booked for six - monthly check - ups was wasteful and did not target those most in need			1
instead , doctors should identify those who require specialist support			1
' wasteful ' : @entity8 said automatically booking patients for six - monthly check - ups did not target those most in need ( file picture ) the time spent by hospitals on routine follow - up appointments has increased almost 10-fold since the 1970s , because of rising numbers of cancer cases and higher survival rates			1
there are two million people who are either living with the disease or have recovered from it			0
this number is expected to double by 2030 , with the survival time for all cancers rising from just one year 40 years ago to almost six years on average			0
patients are living longer due to factors such as timely diagnosis and new drugs			2
@entity38 , the charity 's chief executive , said many survivors are left with long - term health and emotional problems , and feel abandoned by the @entity5			0
but the present system does not address these issues and fails to provide patients and gps with information that could lead to recurrent cancers being detected promptly			2
mr @entity38 said : ' the current follow - up appointments system is past its sell - by date			1
the health and social care services across the @entity53 must radically transform how they deal with patients ' aftercare , especially as the number of people getting and surviving cancer is soaring			2
' doctors need to be able to identify which patients need regular face - to - face appointments and specialist support , and which do n't			1
the time spent by hospitals on routine follow - up appointments has increased almost 10-fold since the 1970s , because of rising numbers of cancer cases and higher survival rates ' they also need to support cancer patients to develop the skills to manage their own conditions			1
' he added : ' the pressure on hospitals will only get worse			0
cancer specialists will be overloaded if we continue with the current system , which is wasteful for the @entity5 and does not give survivors the support they actually need			1
' death rates from cancer in @entity53 have fallen by more than a fifth since 1990			0
the charity said about one in five survivors was likely to benefit from regular follow - up appointments			0
but all needed to be given more information about symptoms that could mean the return of the disease , or other conditions associated with it			0
these were unlikely to be detected in routine check - ups			1
two out of five people living with cancer are unaware of the long - term side effects of cancer treatment , according to the charity 's research			2
it found just a third were give information about coping with the effects of the disease or treatment			0
