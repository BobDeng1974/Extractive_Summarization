@entity0 beat @entity1 to keep their @entity2 under 21 @entity4 ambitions alive as 15 - year - old @entity5 captained his side to victory at @entity9			1
it is something rarely seen in football that a schoolboy such as @entity5 should lead a team made up of players in some cases four or five years older than him			2
but then it is increasingly apparent that @entity5 , one of the best up - and - coming centre - halves in the youth game , is no ordinary teenager			1
indeed , chairman @entity83 went public a long time ago with his frustration that one of the @entity2 ’s big clubs could easily turn @entity5 ’s head and acquire him for a fee as paltry as £ 250,000			2
and so mature performances such as this one may have to be savoured by the @entity0 faithful as they kept their chances of progressing to the knockout stage in this first edition of the @entity4			0
after @entity64 had handed the @entity95 visitors a third - minute lead , an unstoppable strike from @entity23 and an assured finish from @entity45 turned the tables			1
@entity64 celebrates with his team - mates after scoring the opener early in the match @entity0 youth player @entity103 posted a picture on @entity105 of his view from the stands @entity108 @entity77 @entity109 @entity110 @entity111 group b @entity113 @entity0 @entity114 @entity1 @entity115 @entity116 @entity117 @entity118 @entity119 @entity120 @entity121 @entity122 @entity123 @entity124 this match failed to live up to the end - to - end excitement of @entity0 ’s first foray into this tournament last month , when @entity114 beat them 5 - 3 at the same venue , but it was a more favourable result			1
in the meantime , @entity1 had beaten @entity114 1 - 0 and were therefore seeking to ensure their qualification as they arrived at the @entity132 on a crisp november night			1
and they enjoyed the perfect start when @entity62 controlled the ball in a dangerous area and teed up @entity64 to fire past @entity0 keeper @entity36			0
the @entity137 stopper then showed great reflexes to thwart @entity61 at his near post while @entity5 had to be alert to slide in and thwart @entity32 as @entity1 continued their positive start			2
@entity45 , scorer of the winning goal , vies for the ball ( left ) , while @entity31 attempts a tackle ( right ) 15 - year - old centre - back @entity5 , pictured in august , captained @entity0 's under 21s on wednesday night gradually , the hosts gained a foothold in the game and @entity41 connected well with a corner only to see his half - volley go wide of the post			1
and on 37 minutes , they gained an equaliser when @entity23 found the top corner with a powerful shot from the edge of the area			0
their parity was well deserved after a strong recovery from a shaky start			0
indeed @entity0 could have led before half - time but goalkeeper @entity162 saved first @entity42 ’s shot on the turn and then @entity45 ’s swerving effort from range			1
but they did n’t have to wait long after the break to gain their reward as @entity42 split the @entity1 defence open and @entity171 ran through to finish well past @entity162			2
@entity1 responded brightly to going behind and @entity62 rattled the post with @entity173 well beaten			0
@entity0 retreated further and further back , taking every opportunity to break up the flow of the game			0
with 10 minutes left , @entity44 ’s wayward shot somehow found its way to @entity179 , who was denied by a terrific @entity173 save			0
the @entity0 managed to hold on through six minutes of added time to claim their first win in this competition and it will now all come down to their match with @entity113 on december 8 to see if they can advance .			0

@entity5 captained @entity188 at the age of 15
the centre - back has been subject to interest from @entity75
@entity64 opened the scoring early on for @entity1
@entity23 levelled the match at 1 - 1 with a long - range effort
@entity45 completed the *comeback* *shortly* after half - time
