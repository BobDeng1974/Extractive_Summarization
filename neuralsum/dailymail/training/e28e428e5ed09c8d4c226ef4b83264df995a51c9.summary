an ultra-orthodox @entity1 village in @entity2 where the welcome sign lists modesty rules has built a series of children ’s playgrounds segregated by gender			1
and though it may sound extreme to some , for a community where male - female interaction is strictly controlled , it was all but a necessity			0
@entity14 , in @entity2 ’s @entity16 region , was founded in 1977 by members of the @entity19 orthodox community as a place where they could practice their strict , morally conservative lifestyle unfettered by outside influence			1
segregated : the @entity19 people who inhabit the @entity2 village of @entity14 exclusively have built a gender segregated playground the construction of the playground takes this ethos a step forward			1
‘ it was time , that the city which was founded according to the regulations and directives of rabbi @entity36 , have a park which is fully sex segregated , according the strict laws of true @entity40 , ” a @entity19 community activist reportedly said			2
the playground is partitioned into four parts : one for fathers with their sons , one for mothers with their daughters , a third for just boys and another just for girls			2
each sectioned is spaced far from the others and the male facilities are blue , while the female sides are red and white			0
a sign in @entity53 outlines the gender - specific rules and warns visitors to ‘ maintain gender separation in all public areas			0
’ watching : signs to the partitioned playgrounds warn visitors to obey gender separation rules			0
the town 's ' modest committee ' will keep watch private : the red and blue playground ' compounds ' were built with private finds after the village refused government grant money @entity70 reports that the playground will be ‘ under the supervision of the committee of modesty			1
’ it has also been reported that only the @entity19 of @entity14 will be allowed in the playground			1
around one - third of the town ’s over 20,000 residents received some form of government assistance in 2011 , but the town itself apparently draws a lie at receiving free government money			1
@entity14 reportedly refused a grant of $ 195,000 from the state of @entity2 in 2001 to build a park , and instead used ‘ special financing ’ courtesy of the mayor , rabbi @entity89			1
meanwhile , the playground is located at the outskirts of @entity93 , @entity2 — the town in which the village is situated — making it uncertain how the strict rules will be greeted by the larger community in the area			2
the tradition in the villages of @entity102 is modesty			0
even on the hottest of days , most residents cover up from head to toe , with unmarried men and women kept apart at all times			0
women also can not wear provocative clothes as men are not supposed to see anything that inspires inappropriate thoughts			0
close : only around 50 miles outside the largest city in the @entity116 , the town now claims the country first sex - segregated playground			0

the @entity19 of @entity14 , @entity2 built the park without the help of government money
it *remains* to be seen if area townspeople will also be welcome in the playground
