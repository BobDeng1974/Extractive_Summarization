eating certain pigment - rich foods daily can contribute to building up the skin 's natural barrier to the sun 's harmful rays			1
particular fruits and vegetables such as dark purple berries and dark green veggies contain special protective compounds , and it 's all down to their concentrated pigmentation			0
dermatologists and skin scientists at the forefront of photo - dermatology ( the scientific study of ultraviolet light and its effects on skin ) have made the pioneering discovery			2
eating certain foods can contribute to building up the skin 's natural barrier to the sun 's harmful rays the body utilises the food 's compounds near the skin 's surface to give a base level of protection against damaging uv rays			1
known as a @entity33 ( @entity34 ) , this is the first time scientists have ascribed an @entity34 value to diets based on the nature and quantity of natural plant pigments			1
one of the benefits of this approach is that all day long , even cloudy days when sun cream is n't used regularly , a ' base ' level protection is supplied against the damaging effects of uv light			1
@entity47 and @entity49 dr @entity48 explains : ' the level of protection against uv light can be assessed in a similar way to which sun creams are rated @entity55 or 20 ; where the higher the number , the greater the protection against damage from uv rays			1
by eating foods that protect your skin against uv rays you are effectively achieving sun protection at all times of the day and on all areas on your body			2
' dermatologist dr @entity68 notes : ' a @entity69 ( @entity34 ) could be a useful tool alongside appropriate sun cream use in achieving healthy skin all year round			1
furthermore , a form of base @entity34 from dietary and supplement sources would provide a degree of protection during relatively short sun cream - free times when invaluable @entity82 production takes place naturally			1
' blackcurrants blueberries blackberries black grapes figs oranges @entity91 squash dark green peppers @entity93 spinach dr @entity48 tells @entity95 : ' plants themselves are the heroes here			2
it 's a matter of multi mechanistic effects			0
' the plant pigments in these foods gravitate to the skin where they are deposited			2
' uv light hitting the skin is slightly dissipated by the molecules the foods provide			0
with the right amount their energy is n't passed onto our delicate dna			0
' they help the skin cope with uv light by suppressing the damaging effects of sunlight , neutralising free radicals and reducing redness and inflammation			0
' they can also help with the anti-ageing skin effects on an extra-cellular level			0
the glue that holds the skin together - mucopolysaccharides - is where collagen exists			0
the health of that material is dependent on the type of food you eat			2
you see relatively more severe wrinkling in people who eat less of these fruits and vegetables			0
' plus they help with other more severe harm from the sun. ' when light falls on the skin these plant compounds can help combat photo - immuno suppression – if left unchecked this stage can lead to the initiation and development of cancer cells in the skin			0
' in essence these multi-protective plant materials give the body the tools it needs to help protect its delicate dna from sun damage			0
’ sun creams should not be used to increase sun exposure time but to increase protection but to obtain @entity34 10 from diet alone , you would need to consume a portion of kale and almost a kilo of black seedless grapes daily			1
while eating these ' super ' foods contribute to protection from the sun 's harmful rays , very few people actually eat enough of them on a daily basis to achieve a base level @entity169 through diet alone			1
@entity172 from naturesbest.co.uk , the first supplement that can provide skin with @entity34 , provides a potent source of plant compounds for an average @entity34 10 achieved after 12 weeks of use			2
@entity48 explains : ' while @entity172 will never replace the effectiveness of a high @entity34 sun cream , it provides an all - year - round ' base ' @entity34 and the potential for reducing the long - term ageing effects of sun exposure '			1

scientists put an @entity34 ' number ' to foods ; a @entity201 ( @entity34 )
