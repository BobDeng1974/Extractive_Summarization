if there was a textbook on @entity7 ’s management style , the antics of @entity2 ’s players against @entity3 would be page one			1
surrounding the referee , complaining about decisions , elbows , and intimidation			0
save for the poor result , it had all the hallmarks of a @entity7 classic			1
however , if the histrionics start to outweigh performances the @entity17 has a habit of losing favour fast			0
it ’s what killed his reign at @entity25			2
@entity7 shows his frustrations during @entity2 's match against @entity3 on wednesday night @entity2 players surround referee @entity29 and demand a red card is shown to @entity31 @entity31 ( right ) gets up as nine @entity2 players surround him and the referee after the incident one of the battles @entity7 fought at @entity25 was with the club ’s own match delegate @entity36			1
‘ @entity44 ’ , as he is known to everyone , played for over a decade at right - back for @entity25 before continuing to serve the club after hanging up his boots			1
as part of the staff allowed to sit on the bench during games alongside goalkeeping coach @entity49 , fitness coach @entity50 , and @entity7 ’s @entity51 and current @entity53 manager @entity52 , @entity44 soon became part of the systematic applying of pressure on the fourth official			1
it was understood that @entity7 liked his assistants to rotate the badgering of match officials so to limit the likelihood any one individual would be sent off			2
@entity44 , who respected – and was respected by – @entity7 , thought the tactic was below a club like @entity25			1
@entity66 daily @entity65 claimed he told his manager as much saying : ‘ we do n’t do that kind of thing here ’ , and also suggested it was common knowledge among the players that @entity44 hated the role so much he would often approach the fourth official and appear to remonstrate with him when really he was just asking him if he had the time , or if knew what time @entity25 ’s big department store @entity75 opened in the morning			1
@entity7 ( centre ) talks with @entity25 delegate @entity78 during a @entity80 match in 2010 @entity81 ( centre ) appeals to the referee following @entity31 's tackle on @entity84 during the first half @entity2 players later look dejected as they are knocked out of the @entity88 round of 16 @entity7 has always believed matches are won not just by the eleven on the pitch but by everyone at the club			1
and neither are they just won with football			0
if the opposition can be intimidated and bullied – and if that affects their ability to play – then that serves the end - game goal of victory			0
@entity7 ’s ‘ us against them ’ battle plan at @entity25 lasted three years			1
it left many at the club burned - out and almost relieved when it was replaced by the calm bought by @entity106 , but it can not be said that it did not bring trophies			0
it ’s true that he never reached the @entity88 final at the club but he did win the @entity111 in his first season and @entity80 in his second			2
that might have been small fare in any other era but against the best @entity118 team in history it ca n’t be seen that way			0
the third season at the @entity122 that produced no trophies came when there were perhaps more dissenting voices inside the dressing room than there were players prepared to do it @entity7 ’s way			0
the key to @entity7 ’s success is that everybody rows to the same rhythm – once a couple of galley members have downed oars there are problems			0
@entity7 ( right ) argues with the referee as @entity141 ( left ) looks on during a match in april 2013 @entity25 players look on as @entity7 ( left ) is involved in an argument with the referee during the 2011 @entity88 semi-final against @entity118 on the pitch players often had to curtail their instincts to try to just out - play the opposition by surrendering to an overall plan to out - strategize them too			1
the beginnings of the fall - outs with @entity153 and @entity154 came because they believed , having won the @entity155 with @entity66 , they could match @entity118 for football			1
others , such as @entity158 , sided with @entity7 believing that they would never out - play @entity160 ’s team and they had to be cleverer			2
part of @entity7 ’s belief that it would take more than just football to beat @entity118 came from his experience at @entity165			0
they beat @entity160 ’s @entity118 in the semi-finals of the @entity88 on their way to beating @entity169 in the final but they did it with their centre - forward at full - back as an early sending off for @entity174 left them with most of the game having to play with 10 men			2
his victory jig on the pitch that night interrupted only by the @entity180 sprinklers and @entity181 trying to usher him off the pitch is one of the images of his career and it set the tone for his time at @entity25 but it did n’t always work			0
in @entity7 ’s first season , and just after one of his greatest triumphs with @entity188 in the @entity111 final 1 - 0 courtesy of a goal from @entity141 , @entity118 and @entity25 were drawn together again in the semi-finals of the @entity88			1
@entity141 ( back ) leaps high to score the winning goal in the 2011 @entity111 final against @entity118 @entity25 players celebrate with the trophy after winning @entity80 in the season of 2011 - 12 the players were flying believing that after their cup final success they now had the measure of @entity118			2
but @entity7 thought otherwise and set his team up in the first leg at the @entity122 to not lose			2
they would defend stubbornly and in numbers and frustrate @entity118 before going for them in the latter stages of the match			0
if they scored a late goal to put them ahead in the tie then perfect ; if not then a 0 - 0 would be a good result to take back to the @entity180 where without an away goal and bound to go on the attack , @entity118 would leave themselves open on the break			0
@entity141 was one of the dissenters famously putting his hands on his hips and looking to the heavens when during one period of the first half he found himself the only man pressing @entity118 ’s defenders			0
the rest were obeying orders to sit back and not be drawn out of position			0
@entity141 looks dejected as he leaves the field after defeat by @entity118 in the @entity88 in 2011 the plan may well have worked to perfection but @entity228 was sent off in the second half after clashing with @entity230 and against 10 men @entity232 scored twice to leave @entity25 with no chance in the second leg			1
@entity7 recovered his players ’ faith and winning the league the following season was his greatest achievement in @entity66			1
opinion is still divided over his legacy			0
one television station in @entity66 suggested this week that @entity7 was among three candidates to replace @entity106 along with @entity243 and @entity244			1
others shook their heads at the incredulity of the idea he will ever return			0
the purists tut - tutted their way through that league winning campaign shaking their heads at those lightning counter-attacks so brutally effective but lacking the refinery of @entity118 ’s 20 - pass moves to goal			0
but it worked because @entity25 and @entity7 won			1
it ’s when it no longer works - as it did n’t for @entity2 on wednesday - is it really called into question .			2

@entity2 were knocked out of the @entity88 last - 16 by @entity3
wednesday 's match had all the hallmarks of a @entity7 classic
there were similar histrionics during his reign at @entity25
@entity78 ' @entity44 ' @entity36 thought the tactic was below the @entity66 club
opinion is still divided in @entity66 over @entity7 's legacy at @entity25
