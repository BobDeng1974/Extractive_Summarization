by @entity0 follow @ @ charliesale there is disquiet among the @entity4 executive about president @entity5 's unilateral move to spend an alleged £ 16million funding a film about world football 's ruling body			2
several members of @entity4 ’s decision - making committee were unaware that @entity12 , charting the history of @entity4 and launched at the @entity14 this week , had been made , let alone that @entity5 had spent so much of the organisation ’s money on the project			0
following @entity19 revealing @entity5 ’s massive investment on what is expected to be a huge box office flop , @entity4 powerbrokers have a number of questions for their leader			0
trouble : @entity4 president @entity5 ( second from left ) faces questions from members after spending £ 16million on a film project about the organisation namely , why does n’t @entity4 ’s funding of the film appear in the latest financial accounts ? what allocated budget is the money coming from ? and how can the spending be justified when @entity4 are cutting costs knowing that the problematic @entity39 @entity38 is going to be a lot more expensive than first envisaged ? certainly the film issue is likely to impact on @entity5 at the @entity4 congress in @entity43 in three weeks , when he is due to announce his candidature for a fifth term as president			1
staying on ? @entity5 is set to announce his candidature for a fifth term as @entity4 president in three weeks the busy @entity50 is to replace @entity51 as presenter of @entity55 ’s @entity54 coverage , with @entity19 having written last year that @entity56 would not host the programme following his crass ‘ never a looker ’ comment about women ’s champion @entity59			1
the @entity62 would not comment on whether @entity63 , who will present the daily tv highlights on @entity66 , was being punished for his gaffe			0

. @entity68 might have switched their @entity38 hotel and training base if they had known in advance that manager @entity73 would be taking over at @entity74			1
the @entity75 on @entity78 ’s @entity77 beach and @entity80 ’s complex where @entity68 will train are open to the public , giving @entity82 little respite from what will be a media frenzy			1
by comparison , @entity87 ’s @entity86 , further out of @entity78 , and their @entity89 military base training facility look havens of tranquillity			2

. @entity93 will not show commercials during the drinks breaks which will occur during a number of @entity38 matches			1
@entity4 gave broadcasters the option of advertising during the cooling periods , which will be decided on a match - by - match basis by the venue medical officer if the temperature exceeds 32 ° @entity105 but @entity93 , despite the potential advertising riches , wanted to keep their broadcasts focused on the game , which was felt to be in the best interests of viewers			0

@entity112 's generation game the @entity112 clan are not only heading to @entity39 for the @entity38 but are showing support to @entity115 during @entity87 training in @entity118 ’s @entity117 do @entity119 this week			1
@entity112 ’s father - in - law @entity120 and livewire four - year - old son @entity121 watched wednesday ’s session from the middle of the media pack before going back to their holiday base to celebrate the first birthday of @entity121 ’s brother @entity128			2
so relaxed is manager @entity129 in this first week of the @entity38 adventure that he invited a @entity132 resident , who he had met while out for a stroll , to watch training , too			0
sealed with a kiss : @entity87 striker @entity112 kisses his son @entity121 before a training session in @entity138 the weather in the @entity140 this week is very similar to that in @entity142 , highlighting the bizarre situation of @entity87 preparing for the @entity38 away from @entity144 , the £ 100million training centre where @entity129 ’s squad are spending less than three full days during the build - up to @entity39			1
@entity129 defends such sparse use of the national facility by saying it is better bonding as a squad when you go abroad and that @entity144 was n’t built solely for senior team use			0
wrapped up warm : @entity154 ( left ) and @entity155 ( right ) wear jogging bottoms and coats during training on wednesday @entity159 and @entity160 being left out of the @entity38 squad means @entity87 will go into a major tournament with every member of the party prepared to talk to the media			1
things will have gone remarkably well if the same co-operation is in place come july			0
meanwhile , @entity170 ’s £ 30m - rated @entity169 , a target for @entity74 , is not expected to know where he will play next season until after the @entity38 , adding to the pressure on the 18 - year - old left back in @entity39			1
on the move ? @entity87 's @entity169 will go to the @entity38 with his future at @entity170 undecided			2

@entity50 to replace @entity51 for @entity55 's @entity54 coverage
@entity73 and @entity68 will have @entity38 training sessions open to the public
