by @entity0 published : 10:57 est , 26 november 2012 updated : 10:57 est , 26 november 2012 scientists have identified a gene which could help solve the problem of infertility in humans			1
the team at the @entity7 conducted a study with fruit flies , during which they found that when the gene @entity12 is missing , chromosomes do not ' huddle ' together			1
they believe the huddling process is necessary to ensure the egg ’s healthy development and fertilisation			1
when the @entity12 gene is missing , chromosomes do not ' huddle ' together , something necessary for the egg 's healthy development and fertilisation chromosomes are thread - like structures which contain a person ’s dna , and when they divide it can lead to sterility and low fertility , according to the study			1
previous research in mice has shown that the huddling process is essential in order for eggs to remain fertile , the scientists said			2
by identifying the genes involved in the process , the experts now hope to gain an understanding of what goes on in the creation of fertile reproductive cells			0
fruit fly eggs serve as a good model to understand why low fertility arises in humans , say the researchers the team said further research is needed to help build a more detailed picture on how huddling works			0
professor @entity54 , from the @entity7 ’s @entity55 , said : ' fruit fly eggs serve as a good model to understand why sterility and low fertility arises in humans			0
' by studying the phenomenon of chromosome clustering , shared by fruit flies and humans and identifying genes like @entity12 we are gaining insights into fertility health			1
' the study is published in the @entity69 and was funded by the @entity70			0
scientists from the @entity72 in @entity73 and @entity74 shave previously found that a faulty gene could help explain some cases of unexplained male infertility			2
mutations of the @entity80 gene were found in a small percentage of infertile men			0
in the majority of cases , doctors can find no cause for male infertility , despite it accounting for up to half of cases in which couples have difficulty conceiving			0
male infertility appears to be more common within certain families , and this leads scientists to believe that there may be a genetic root for some cases , but only a handful of gene mutations which might be responsible have actually been found .			2

chromosomes must ' huddle ' together to ensure an egg ’s healthy development and fertilisation
but when the gene @entity12 is missing , they can not do this , say @entity111 scientists
