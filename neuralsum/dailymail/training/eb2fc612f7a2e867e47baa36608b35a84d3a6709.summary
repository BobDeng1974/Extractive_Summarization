by @entity0 @entity2 ’s towns and cities are in danger of becoming ' bland , homogenous metropolises ' like new cities in @entity8 and @entity9 by the year 2029 , a leading planning expert has said			1
expert @entity10 said historic areas of the @entity2 's largest towns - including @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 - could be overrun with ' identikit ' shopping centres , office towers and ' analogous housing estates ' within 15 years			1
medieval architecture and iconic landmarks are at risk of being ' ensnared ' by tasteless architecture as uninspired , cost - cutting developers resort to ' one - stop ' solutions to the built towns , he added			1
historic parts of the @entity2 's largest cities - including central @entity13 , @entity29 pictured - could be overrun with ' identikit ' shopping centres , officer blocks and housing estates within 15 years , @entity10 has said the expert said @entity2 towns could be overrun with office blocks and shopping centres like many locations in @entity8 , the city of @entity34 pictured mr @entity10 , head of design at the @entity41 , said parts of the @entity2 will soon resemble the newly - built cities of @entity8 and @entity9 unless urgent steps were taken to avoid a ' collision course with mediocrity			1
' writing in his new book , living in @entity48 : @entity49 and @entity50 , he said : ' over the next 15 years @entity8 is set to urbanise 300 million people and build the equivalent urban area of @entity53			1
' @entity13 alone is set to grow by two million people by 2030			2
this is the greatest period of urbanisation in human history and yet the buildings and places we are designing and developing leave a great deal to be desired			0
' according to the @entity64 , the world ’s urban population is set to rise to 6.4billion by 2050			0
this will create unprecedented demand for housing in cities in both the @entity2 and internationally			2
the historic buildings of @entity70 , @entity13			2
mr @entity10 says cities across the world are becoming identical thanks to cost - cutting developers who rely on ' one stop ' building solutions the skyline of @entity78 , @entity79 - which the planning expert says has numerous identical - looking buildings			1
mr @entity10 says so - called ' clones towns ' in the @entity2 will affect people 's well being and happiness mr @entity10 warns that such high levels of urban growth may encourage designers and developers to opt for cheaper ' lowest - common - denominator solutions '			1
housing , offices and shops ' from @entity78 to @entity94 to @entity13 ' are already ' becoming identical ' , the planning expert says			2
at the current rate of growth , ' soulless architecture ' will transform the look and feel of @entity2 ’s cities by the end of the late 2020s , he added			2
mr @entity10 argues the ' clone crisis ' has the potential of affecting people ’s health , wellbeing and general happiness			1
he says : ' the prospect of hundreds of millions of people ending up in nondescript developments without a sense of identity will lead to future social problems : alienation , isolation , crime and more			0
' it will also have economic repercussions			0
local businesses are vital for injecting money into a community and attracting visitors , while bland developments will rapidly depreciate in resale value and discourage future investment			0
mr @entity10 says people living in ' nondescript ' and high - rise developments , like this one in @entity8 pictured , will lead to future social problems such as isolation and crime ' we are all moving in the direction of a default life ; a sort of @entity136 - wearing model , living in a glass tower , eating @entity138 , drinking in @entity139 and watching our local version of the x-factor			1
' there is already concern with the rise of so - called ‘ clone towns ’ in the @entity2 , but the problem is far bigger than this			1
we are heading towards a clone world			0
when did life become so generic ? ' the book echos prince @entity151 now infamous ' carbuncle ' speech - delivered at the 150th anniversary of the @entity154 , the setting @entity155 almost thirty years ago			0
prince @entity151 , who is known for his dislike of some modern architecture following his now infamous ' @entity159 ' speech at the @entity154 ' ( @entity154 ) the prince had been invited to present the @entity160 to the @entity9 architect @entity161 when he said : ' what is proposed is like a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend			2
' @entity151 was speaking about the then proposed extension of the @entity167 designed by @entity168			0
the carbuncle was never built following the speech			0
mr @entity10 spent two years researching his book by visiting some of the world ’s most successful developments and by identifying ' dismal cities ' and many ' dramatic , large - scale mistakes '			1
he argues that quality , uplifting architecture need n’t be expensive and that it would create new districts that residents would be proud of for future generations			0
he says : ' i am not condemning this form of architecture , for which there is an obvious demand , but rather encouraging more considered thinking in an attempt to fuse money - driven design with an engaging and culturally led public realm			0
' my hope is that anyone interested in creating the world of tomorrow will be better equipped to make outstandingly liveable cities			0

@entity10 says within 15 years our historic cities will be ' identikit '
says *swathes* of @entity2 will look like newly - built areas of @entity8 and @entity9
cities , including @entity13 , will suffer from ' tasteless architecture ' , he says
claims so - called ' clone crisis ' will affect people 's well being and happiness
*overpopulation* of cities and cost - cutting developers are to blame , he adds
