there are plenty of people around who do it			0
' things have gone up in price but in this climate the items are still available , you just have to know where to get them from			0
' i have every confidence that somebody can put their mind to it and do it easily			0
you start to think about what you need , not what you want but what you actually need			0
it 's surprising how much you can cut out that way			0
' it comes down to a few things and that 's when you work out what you will spend			0
' the @entity72 teacher began her challenge in june 2006 when she bet her friends she could live on £ 1 a day for a year to save for her brother 's wedding			1
challenge : ms @entity6 soon learned to spot a bargain and regularly visited supermarkets and butchers at the end of the day to buy reduced bread and vegetables ongoing : ms @entity6 gave up her challenge once it was completed , but she has said she still lived as frugally as she did before , spending around £ 6 or £ 7 a day she soon learned to spot a bargain and regularly visited supermarkets and butchers at the end of the day to buy reduced bread and vegetables			1
and even though she gave up her challenge once it was completed , ms @entity6 said she still lived as frugally as she did before , spending around £ 6 or £ 7 a day			1
' when it comes down to food it is easy , there are bargains , freebies and common plants you can forage for ' , she said			0
' you just have to know when to get to certain supermarkets to get the deals			0
' the plants are grown anywhere , even at this time of year , you just have to look for chickweek , nettles , wild garlic or young beech leaves - 80g of that is your five - a - day			2
' it is more difficult when you have a family , i was single when i lived off £ 1 a day , but i still think you could do it			2
' even with kids you just need to look up things to do on the internet , there are so many free things in and around where you live			2
you do n't need to spend money down the pub , yes it 's nice to do that but you do n't need to			0
' we are used to many treats in our culture but we do n't have to spend money			0
you can even do it with your friends , they do n't have to spend money either			2
' as for the bills , my rent included my bills so i did well that way			0
it did n't include internet or phone though			0
' i used the library to send emails and keep in contact with friends , they allow you to get a couple of hours free			2
' ms @entity6 , who lives with partner @entity140 , said it would be difficult for @entity3 to live on the small amount given what he was used to , but that it would be easy once he got used to the idea			1

' breadline : after he was challenged , mr @entity3 insisted he would take ' no bloody lessons ' from those calling for him to live on £ 53 a week , saying he had been on the breadline twice mr @entity3 was challenged to live on £ 53 a week during an interview on @entity26 in which he defended wide - ranging cuts to welfare which took effect earlier this week			1
the @entity3 said the @entity162 's benefits reforms would allow people to ' break free ' of welfare dependency			2
but when challenged on whether he could live on £ 7.57 per day , mr @entity3 replied : ' if i had to , i would			1
' an online petition then calling on mr @entity3 to live for a year on £ 53 a week , which had been seized on by @entity167 opposing cuts to the vast welfare budget , attracted almost 300,000 signatures by the following night			1
but mr @entity3 insisted he would take ‘ no bloody lessons ’ from those calling for him to live on the small sum , saying he had been on the breadline twice			1
he accused @entity174 and the @entity175 of fuelling a ‘ stunt ’ after he made the suggestion he could survive on that amount			0
a little goes a long way as the saying goes , but living off just £ 1 - a - day really is making the pennies count			2
