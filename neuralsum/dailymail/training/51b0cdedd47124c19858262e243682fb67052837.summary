by @entity0 published : 01:33 est , 18 april 2012 updated : 01:53 est , 18 april 2012 for years it has been a village synonymous with one of @entity4 's most famous cheeses			2
but while the @entity8 village of @entity9 may claim to be the home of the crumbly blue favourite , those who produce the cheese are bizarrely not allowed to use its famous name			1
a current @entity14 ruling means @entity9 cheese can only be produced by seven dairies in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
tradition : cheese makes in @entity9 , @entity8 , have been banned from using the name for the famous cheese produced in their village famous : @entity9 makes the most of its association with the famous cheese , and villagers are hoping to gain official recognition from @entity33 soon the ' ridiculous ' decision means that while the famous blue cheese can be made in @entity9 , it has to go by the name @entity37			1
now , after last year finally winning the right to produce @entity9 in their village at all , campaigners in @entity8 want the right to call their product by its proper name			1
the current dispute over @entity9 being able to use the cheese 's name in its own village stems in part from the historic blue 's history			1
historical evidence suggests a cream cheese was being made and sold in and around @entity9 in the late 17th century			2
a recipe for @entity9 cheese was published in a newsletter by @entity56 in 1723 , but no details were given on its size , shape , or how long it was matured			2
in 1724 @entity60 commented in his ' tour through the villages of @entity63 & @entity64 ' of @entity9 being ' famous for cheese ' and referred to the cheese as being the ' @entity67 '			1
a later article by @entity69 in 1726 suggested that the perfect @entity9 should be ... ' about 7 inches in diameter , 8 inches in height and 18 lbs in weight			0
' as @entity9 became a trading post between @entity75 and @entity76 , the cheese was said to be sold to passing traders			2
as demand for the cheese grew , its production moved to @entity17 and @entity19			1
it was at this stage that the cheese 's trademark blue veins became a part of the product , as it also became semi-hard blue cheese			0
on monday the village of @entity9 applied to @entity33 for an extension of the protected designation of origin ( @entity94 ) for the cheese to cover their parish			1
the village launched their campaign two days ago at the start of @entity102 2012 , and will boost their efforts by adding the phrase ' @entity106 of @entity9 ' to a sign outside their village			2
stilton cheese is said by some to have got its name after being sold to travellers passing through the village in the 18th century			0
officials in @entity116 , @entity17 , however , say @entity9 was only a trade link and that the recipe was created in their county			1
@entity9 is officially recognised as coming from @entity17 , and can only be produced there and in its two neighbouring counties following the @entity94 in 1996			1
@entity123 , landlord of the @entity124 in @entity9 , makes a version of the cheese which until now he has had to call @entity37			2
he said that not being able to call the cheese @entity9 is ' embarrassing ' , especially given the tourist appeal that comes with the product			0
he said : ' we get people coming in all the time saying , " oh , can you direct me to the cheese factory ? " ' if you asked 99 per cent of the population where the cheese comes from , they would say @entity9			0
' the campaign in @entity9 has been created by various people and businesses in the village , and fronted by local historian @entity143			0
he told the @entity144 : ' since first being announced at last year ’s @entity148 event , this campaign has continued to gather momentum			0
' we have now fulfilled @entity33 ’s requirements that we must be making the cheese , which we have been doing since 2011 and that it must be for commercial sale			0
' they are the conditions that need to be satisfied before applying for an amendment to the @entity94			0
' @entity157 , chairman of the @entity158 , disputes whether blue @entity9 was ever made in the village of the same name			0
a spokesperson for @entity33 said : ' to amend the geographical boundaries of an existing protected food , an applicant must first prove they are an interested party by showing they genuinely already make it commercially on a permanent , regular basis			0
' we would then carefully consider an application and if the claim was justified we would hold a @entity4 - wide public consultation before making any decision			0
' association : @entity9 has long enjoyed a link to the famous blue cheese , and even has an annual @entity9 cheese rolling event through the village landlord @entity123 makes a recipe that follows the @entity9 recipe , but under @entity183 rules is forced to call it ' @entity37 '			1

@entity8 village claims to be *birthplace* of famous cheese - but can not use its name
@entity192 *law* states @entity9 can only be produced in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19
