@entity0 has been accused of ‘ sexualising toddlers ’ after advertising bras for two - year - old girls			1
charities and campaigners last night condemned the department store as a ‘ disgrace ’ for selling replica women ’s underwear to fit children aged between two and five			2
the £ 8 ‘ vintage floral bras ’ attracted dozens of complaints from mothers , who branded the supposedly family - orientated retailer ‘ disgusting ’			1
following the outcry , the collection was removed from the retailer ’s website and later put back on with what the retailer says was the correct sizing			2
a spokesman insisted it had been a mistake and that the bras were meant for girls aged 11 and older			1
but the cotton bras , which are still being sold in stores , are alongside matching vests and knickers in the same fabric which start at two years of age			1
they also measure only 20 inches around the chest in the smallest size – which is actually slightly smaller than the average two - year - old			1
the knickers in the matching pink and white floral pattern state clearly on the label that they are for two - year - old girls			1
the news comes as prime minister @entity52 this week promised a crackdown on sexualised images of children on the internet			1
@entity57 , founder of the @entity60 ’s biggest parenting website @entity58 , said last night : ‘ there is no need for a bra measuring 20 inches			2
it ’s unnecessary and unsavoury to ask tiny girls to dress in replicas of women ’s underwear			0
' unsavoury ' : the bra alongside matching vest and knickers , which has since been removed from the website advert : website shows the bras being retailed for girls aged ' 2 years ' through to ' 5 years ' but @entity0 said it was a mistake and they are intended to be sold for girls aged 11 and over ‘ some may try to justify it saying it ’s for little girls who want to copy their mums , but we should n’t be encouraging toddlers to be body - conscious			1
’ @entity87 , chief executive of the charity @entity89 , agreed , adding : ‘ @entity90 and two - year - olds in the same sentence just does n’t compute			0
if this is so , it is unacceptable and very disturbing			0
‘ if you spoke to any mother or father of a child of that age , it would be out of their orbit of thinking			0
’ mothers on parenting forums described the products as ‘ wrong ’ and ‘ dangerous ’			0
one wrote on @entity106 : ‘ the sexualisation of small girls makes me so sad			0
‘ childhood seems to be something we get nostalgic about , not something we allow children to actually have any more			0
’ and a user called @entity116 posted on the @entity118 forum : ‘ they do matching knickers too ... i am flabbergasted ! they ’ve got a proper bra clasp ! that ’s a health and safety issue for a start			0
’ parents also took to social media to condemn the store			0
@entity127 wrote on @entity128 : ‘ a bra for a 2 year old ? ! appalled at @entity0			2
’ the £ 8 ‘ vintage floral bras ’ attracted dozens of complaints from mothers , who branded the supposedly family - orientated retailer ‘ disgusting ’ a spokesman from @entity0 said an error had occurred when the product was put on the website , meaning that it was categorised by age and not size , which is not how they would label underwear this is not the first time the store , well - known for its heart - warming @entity147 adverts , has been accused of selling inappropriate clothing for very young girls			1
one range sold on its website has girls ’ clothes for ages 6 and up that are based on their adult collection			1
this range , by @entity157 , includes skimpy black faux - leather hot pants which are dry clean only , a short denim mini-skirt and a pair of tight tweed shorts			2
campaign group @entity163 said they ‘ were n’t surprised ’ to find bras for toddlers			0
‘ this is n’t the first time we ’d brought up the question of @entity0 selling sexualised clothing to young girls , ’ said the group ’s co-founder , @entity166			1
‘ in fact , @entity172 stands out as displaying some of the worst gender stereotypes we ’ve found			0
’ the knickers in the matching pink and white floral pattern state clearly on the label that they are for two - year - old girls ( pictured ) a spokesman for @entity0 said it does not sell or condone the sale of bras to young children , adding : ‘ @entity90 are designed to stretch , so our @entity17 bra will fit a 28 - inch chest even if it measures at a smaller size when on the hanger			1
’ however , despite the label inside saying 28 inches – the chest size of a typical 11 - year - old girl – when a @entity196 reporter stretched the bra to its full capacity it only reached around 22 inches			1
the spokesman added : ‘ we sell bras by size and not by age and the products are clearly marked in this way and labelled by size in our shops			2
an error occurred when the product was put on our website , meaning that it was categorised by age and not size			2
this was corrected straight away			0
’ several other retailers have faced criticism in the past for selling inappropriate girls ’ clothing			0
in 2010 , @entity219 was forced to withdraw padded bikinis for seven - year - olds after the prime minister branded them ‘ disgraceful ’ .			0

the £ 8 ' vintage floral bras ' were sold as part of @entity0 *'s* ' girl ' range
cotton bras removed from website after dozens of mothers complained
@entity233 said it was a mistake and they were meant for girls aged over 11
