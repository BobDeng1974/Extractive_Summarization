just wizard : @entity0 will co-produce a new play based on her @entity3 tales , which is set to open in the @entity4 within the next two years truly it ’s beyond wizard			1
i can exclusively reveal that a play based on @entity0 ’s @entity3 tales will open in the @entity4 within two years			1
@entity0 will not write the stage piece — however , she will co-produce and collaborate with a playwright			2
@entity0 ’s seven - volume @entity3 began with @entity12 , published in 1997			2
@entity13 told the books have sold well in excess of 450 million copies and been translated into 77 languages			0
eight movies were made featuring @entity19 as the boy wizard with the thunderbolt scar on his forehead , and @entity23 and @entity24 , as @entity25 and @entity26 , his best pals at @entity28			0
but the play , to be steered by prominent @entity30 and @entity33 producers @entity31 and @entity34 , will mine ( according to a statement sent to me , as a mudblood , by @entity38 yesterday ) ‘ the previously untold story of @entity3 ’s early years as an orphan and outcast ’			1
although the statement did n’t spell it out , i understand that @entity43 , the studio behind the @entity3 pictures , will be involved in the development of the theatre show , just as it was with the @entity48 musical version of @entity50 ’s @entity49 , which is running at the @entity51 , @entity52			1
@entity3 ’s theatrical adaptation will seek to ‘ offer a unique insight into the heart and mind of the now legendary young wizard			0
a seemingly ordinary boy , but one for whom destiny has plans ... ’ @entity0 noted the numerous approaches she has received about putting @entity3 on the stage , but the vision put forth by @entity73 ‘ was the only one that really made sense to me , and which had the sensitivity , intensity and intimacy i thought appropriate for bringing @entity3 ’s story to the stage			0
after a year in gestation , it is very exciting to see this project moving onto the next phrase			0
’ early years : a young @entity19 as @entity3			2
the new show will focus on the previously untold story of @entity3 's early years as an orphan and outcast a theatre has yet to be negotiated , but with a show of this quality — almost a licence to print money if all involved get it right — hopefully the right spell will deliver a theatre exactly when the show ’s ready to go in 2015			1
@entity90 is one of the producers behind @entity92 and the current hit @entity94 , which co-stars @entity3 alumnus @entity23 , while @entity34 produced , with @entity95 , the tv version of the @entity98 ’s landmark adaptation of @entity99 and landed @entity100 on @entity101 this past season with @entity103			2
such classy operators ought to be able to assemble an a-list creative team , and a writer and director will soon be contracted to begin developing the play			0
the model has to be @entity110 , the movie producer behind @entity112 , who acquired the rights to the @entity3 series and ensured that only the very best of @entity119 ( and one or two from beyond our shores ) were entrusted to make the movies			0
backing : it is understood that @entity43 , the studio behind the @entity3 pictures , will be involved in the development of the theatre show , just as it was with the @entity48 musical version of @entity50 ¿ s @entity49 , which is running at the @entity51 , @entity52			1

author @entity0 will collaborate with a playwright for the @entity4 show
play to focus on @entity3 's early years , before his arrival at @entity28
prominent producers @entity31 and @entity34 behind show
@entity43 understood to be involved in development of new production
