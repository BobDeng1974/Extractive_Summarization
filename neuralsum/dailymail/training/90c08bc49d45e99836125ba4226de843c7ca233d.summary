by sir @entity1 - @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 14 september 2013 updated : 04:01 est , 16 september 2013 the @entity2 that has served us so well for 60 years is in crisis			1
the current model is no longer sustainable			1
we are living longer and that means our bodies become harder to maintain			1
many of us who are 60 now will die with at least three different conditions – and the state simply does not have the money to cope			1
at the current rate of growth , spending on healthcare will rise from 8.2 per cent of gdp to 20 per cent over the coming years unless action is taken			1
former chief executive of @entity19 , sir @entity20 has said the @entity2 is no longer suited to our aging population we think of free healthcare as our national birthright – but how much do we really need ? the brutal answer has to be : a lot less			1
the @entity2 will be fundamentally threatened unless non-essential services become the responsibility of communities , charities and individuals – and unless people are prepared to pay for some of them			1
i have just spent nine months talking to people in @entity36 about their care and its future			1
their need is great – the number of people needing social care in @entity36 will grow from 35,000 now to 137,500 by 2030			1
and what they told me was astounding			1
in @entity45 , i was told : ‘ it is the individual who is responsible for their own health – not the government			1
’ in @entity52 , a young mother could n’t understand why the @entity10 funds her maternity care when she made a choice to get pregnant – yet does n’t fund the care of her elderly next - door neighbour			1
in @entity58 , people told me that they would rather see their local hospital closed and the money reinvested in community services			1
first port of call : people should make better use of their local pharmacies says sir @entity1 - @entity20 as an experiment we gave two representative groups of 50 people £ 3.5 billion in virtual money to spend on health and social care , and they did something extraordinary			1
they cut spending on hospitals , drugs and services offered by @entity80 – and reallocated funds to support community services and pharmacies			1
why pharmacies ? because they ’re convenient and often open when surgeries are not			1
a staggering 40 per cent of people in @entity87 and @entity52 use the pharmacy ( or @entity89 ) as their first port of call			1
in @entity94 they did n’t ‘ have a clue ’ where to get help			1
a carer in @entity97 told me that he had a bewildering choice of 28 local organisations and charities offering support			1
and children in @entity97 offered to give up an episode of @entity105 each week to have time to care for an elderly lady in their street			1
these good people of @entity36 have one thing in common			1
they want to take back control of their own health			1
they just need the support of the @entity10 to do so			2
i have briefed ministers , @entity119 and the @entity120 , because what we ’ve learned from the process will have national implications			2
and the reaction has been very positive , at the highest level			2
so by 2016 if you live in @entity36 and are worried , say , by a recurring back pain , you will be able to			2
l use a health ‘ @entity129 ’ and ‘ satnav ’ to find the best help , which might be from the chemist and not the gp			2
l ask someone in your community to drive you to the @entity134 – who will now offer care that you used to get only at @entity139			2
l know that if you think you need a massage , and it is not a clinical necessity , the state will not provide it – but your neighbour might			2
l pay to receive immediate non-urgent care			2
l talk to your ‘ buddy ’ if you ’re vul - nerable			2
l accept that if you go to @entity139 unnecessarily , you are depriving someone else of urgent care			2
in all my years working with patients – 12 of them with @entity153 and after that with @entity155 at the @entity156 – i have never heard more compelling arguments for change articulated by the very people who will be most affected by it			2
a new partnership at a local level between citizens and those who currently provide their care is the best solution to the impending crisis			0
a new understanding between the public sector and the people			0
i will take responsibility for my own health – you , the state , will help me to do so			0
you will give me access to a health ‘ @entity129 ’ – where i can find the best care – and a health ‘ satnav ’ that tells me how i can access these services			0
do n’t assume i ’m not prepared to pay for some of these – i pay for repairs to my car , so why not to my body ? in return , you will give more support and recognition to my informal @entity188 you will always be there for me in a crisis – 24/7			0
identify vulnerable people well before they reach that crisis point			0
i want people to notice if i have started to fall over repeatedly – not just when i ’ve broken my hip			0
astonishingly , @entity80 can not warn the fire service about patients whose mobility problems put them at greater risk in a fire			0
why ? because of data protection @entity202 who is vulnerable should have a care plan , with information about their needs , as a human right			0
and a named ‘ buddy ’ – a district nurse , or a neighbour – to help them			0
3 ) mobilise our most precious asset – the communities we live in			0
we need to create an entire new awards scheme for our most compassionate citizens			0
we need a new organisation to recruit , train and support volunteers who will take responsibility for a number of households			0
you may not want a @entity223 of @entity224 on your street , but a nosy neighbour would at least keep an eye out for you			0
do you know why so many hospitals ask you to bring your drugs with you ? it ’s the only way they can be sure what you ’re taking			0
your gp knows , but does n’t always share the information			0
on the @entity235 they ’re piloting a smartcard loaded with all your details , so that you do n’t have to repeat it to five different members of staff			0
5 ) get round a table with one pot of money and design the best care package for me			0
in @entity36 , there are five or even six pots of money all controlled by different people , some in @entity36 , some in @entity252			0
this is n’t wishful thinking			0
in @entity36 , it is going to happen			0
last thursday @entity256 , leader of @entity257 , confirmed he will be asking the local health and wellbeing board to plan for adoption of our recommendations			0
and it should n’t cost @entity36 a penny more ( since one of our recommendations is that for every service created another must be closed ) .			0

former chief executive of @entity19 has said @entity2 is ' no longer sustainable '
