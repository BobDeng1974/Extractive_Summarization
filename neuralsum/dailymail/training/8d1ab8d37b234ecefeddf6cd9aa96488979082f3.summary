the players will insist the striker was provoked and showed no aggression towards the photographer			1
team - mate @entity18 , who joined @entity4 on a trip to @entity21 in @entity22 on tuesday to hand out presents to sick children , said : ' someone is trying to fabricate a story and that is the disappointing thing			2
it is part and parcel of what we do and we understand that			2
' we have had a fantastic weekend away and you think you have come back with no problems but someone has made something which was nothing as far as i was aware			2
' photographer @entity23 alleges he was eye - gouged , pushed to the floor and that @entity4 attempted to bite him during fracas			1

' @entity4 agreed to have a number of pictures taken at the request of a photographer who was waiting on the street			0

' when he then continued taking more photos he was restrained by the security team for @entity4 's safety			0
eyewitnesses state at no point was there any physical contact between @entity4 and the photographer			0

' ' he ca n't walk without it			0
