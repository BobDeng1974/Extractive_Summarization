gipsies have been banned from setting up illegal campsites across the entire town after a landmark ruling at the @entity4 yesterday @entity26 : the injunction protects 454 ' parcels ' of land across the town - including parks , playgrounds and schools - and is believed to be ' unprecedented ' in its scale			1
above , one travellers ' camp in the town last year in total , the areas covered by the ban account for a third of the land in @entity8 , according to a spokesman for the council			1
gipsies have been moved from illegal encampments in the town - which is just 25 miles from @entity44 , formerly the site @entity45 's largest traveller camp - on 109 occasions since october 2013			2
the temporary injunction will mean anyone illegally camping in @entity8 could be fined or imprisoned for contempt of court			2
it will remain in place until a full hearing later this year			0
the order was served to travellers who were part of an unauthorised camp at @entity58 this morning			0
the group has since moved on from the site , a spokesman at @entity5 said			0
injunction papers will also be displayed on the 454 parcels of land over the coming days			1
the ban applies to 35 named travellers , all of whom have now left the town , and will also protect land from encampments by ' persons unknown '			2
two legal traveller sites in the town , with a total of 44 plots , which will be unaffected by the ruling			0
@entity78 said although injunctions had been granted in other areas of the country , it believed no ban covering an entire town had ever been applied for and granted			1
' blighted ' : gipsies have been moved from illegal campsites in the town on 109 separate occasions since october 2013			1
above , police attend one illegal site that was set up on a cycle path in the town last year ' unprecedented ' : @entity78 said although injunctions had been granted in other areas of the country , it believed no ban on this scale had ever been applied for and granted			1
above , an illegal site pictured last year last year , @entity100 successfully applied for an injunction protecting six ' environmentally sensitive ' areas of land in the city			2
and it was reported in september that @entity106 was seeking a ' blanket ' injunction covering the whole city			0
the ruling by @entity111 at the @entity4 yesterday was welcomed by @entity112 , mp for @entity8 , who described it as a ' major step forward in ridding the town of this blight			2
' @entity5 leader , @entity117 , said : ' the town has had enough and we needed to resolve this situation with a long term solution to protect land now and in the future			0
' an injunction , which covers a piece of land here and there was never going to work , so we had to look at a something which has never been done before and is town - wide			2
' months and months of detailed preparation backed up with a catalogue of community concerns meant we had a very strong case that could be put forward to the judge			0
' it is not - and never has been - about persecuting any particular group of people or their way of life			0
' this situation has really tested the patience of the whole community and we need to end this cat - and - mouse game which is being played			0
' seeking a @entity4 injunction of this size and scale takes time and requires a huge amount of preparation to get it right especially when it has never been done anywhere before			0
' nearby : @entity8 is just 25 miles from @entity44 , pictured , formerly @entity45 's largest traveller camp evicted : @entity153 erupted when gipsies were removed from the illegal site in @entity156 , @entity6 in october 2011 but the decision has been slammed by traveller leaders			1
a spokesman for the @entity160 said : ' unauthorised encampments are a reaction to lack of provision by local authorities			0
' what 's to stop the government from applying for an injunction for the whole country and managing to totally wipe out a way of life ? ' @entity8 stands less than 25 miles from @entity45 's former largest illegal traveller site , @entity44 , in @entity156 , @entity6			1
@entity172 spent more than Â£ 7 million of taxpayers ' money on a controversial eviction of the site in october 2011 following a 10 - year legal battle .			0
