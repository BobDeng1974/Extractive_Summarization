as the @entity2 transfer saga played out this week , another @entity0 no 7 was conducting business in his own rough , tough , meticulous manner that could yet see him oust national captain @entity5 ahead of the @entity6			2
will @entity7 still does n't possess a full @entity9 cap			2
a cruel run of injuries has prevented the @entity13 - born 24 - year - old from showcasing his skills on the highest stage , where most believe he belongs			0
but he is fit again and as desperate to play for his country as at any stage in his injury - chequered five - year professional career			0
@entity7 of @entity21 receives the @entity23 award after the victory over @entity25 @entity5 is hoping to keep hold of his @entity9 shirt in spite of competition for his position ' there 's a massive desire to play for @entity9 , ' @entity7 said at @entity21 ' training ground ahead of saturday 's @entity35 clash with @entity36			1
' i want to play for @entity9 and that 's the be all and end all			2
' while @entity2 has attracted headlines this week for his bid to satisfy the @entity45 's strict selection criteria — which only permits players playing in @entity9 to be selected for the national side — by attempting to sign for @entity48 from @entity49 , it is @entity7 who could yet make a late run on @entity53 's @entity52			1
whether or not he makes the cut when the squad is announced on wednesday , @entity7 is certain of one thing : he has no intention of turning his back on club or country before his international appetite is sated			1
' if i was told if i went abroad i would never play for @entity9 i would n't go — unless there was no chance of me being picked then maybe i 'd consider it , ' he said			0
' but if i knew i still had a chance to play then i 'd stay			0
' @entity7 of @entity21 loses his footing challenging for the ball with @entity68 of @entity69 @entity7 says , unlike @entity2 , he would not move to @entity70 if it would harm his @entity9 prospects music to @entity75 's ears , no doubt			1
the @entity9 coach is a known admirer and called @entity7 into his @entity80 training camp this summer despite another injury - hit year which saw him miss his club 's ultimately unfulfilling climax to the season with a complicated ankle fracture			1
@entity7 showed precisely why with a performance against his @entity9 rival @entity5 at the start of the season described by @entity21 director @entity90 as ' high , high class ' as the men in black humbled @entity25 39 - 0			1
saturday 's clash — a repeat of last season 's semi-final which saw @entity21 crush @entity36 46 - 6 — is another chance for @entity7 to impress @entity75 ahead of wednesday 's eps announcement			2
' if i do n't make the eps squad then i 'll just keep plodding along			0
i know more than most how quickly things can change , ' @entity7 said			0
that last comment is as much a reference to his youngest brother @entity104 — paralysed from the neck down since 2009 following a diving accident — as it is to his own relatively trivial injury issues			0
@entity104 will be watching proudly on saturday and big brother added : ' i grew up 10 minutes down the road and whatever happens this will always be my club			0
' @entity9 coach @entity53 will name his latest international squad next wednesday			1
