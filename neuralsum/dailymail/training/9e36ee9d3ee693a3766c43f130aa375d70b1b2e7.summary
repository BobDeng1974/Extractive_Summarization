potentially harmful : a wider classification of symptoms for adhd in the psychiatric ' bible ' used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and prescriptions for medication , the study warned the diagnosis of @entity3 may have become too broad , leading to needless and potentially harmful treatment for some children , researchers warn			1
a wider classification of symptoms for @entity3 in the psychiatric ‘ bible ’ used by the profession has led to a steep rise in diagnosis and prescriptions for medication , the study warned			1
the group of researchers from @entity24 and the @entity25 said there was now a risk of over diagnosis which could fuel scepticism about the disorder			1
in addition , stretched resources may mean some seriously affected children do not get medical help , or they are undertreated			2
in recent years , the term adhd has been given to a collection of behavioural problems linked to poor attention span including impulsiveness , restlessness and hyperactivity			1
around three to seven per cent of children are believed to have adhd , about 400,000 , with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school			1
prescriptions for stimulant drugs such as @entity50 increased twofold for children and adolescents in the @entity53 , and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008			1
there have been similar rises elsewhere despite little data showing the long term benefits of treatment , says @entity61 , a senior researcher at @entity63 in @entity24 , and colleagues			0
in a report published on bmj.com ( must credit ) , they say @entity24 data shows a 73 per cent increase for @entity3 medication between 2000 and 2011			2
prescriptions for stimulant drugs such as @entity50 increased twofold for children and adolescents in the @entity53 , and fourfold in adults between 2003 and 2008 prescribing in the @entity73 increased steadily between 1996 and 2008 - mostly for adolescents aged 13 - 18 years - with estimated drug costs up to $ 500m			1
such medications can cause adverse reactions such as weight loss , liver toxicity , and suicidal thoughts , and in the short term may suppress pubertal growth			0
dr @entity61 said ‘ compared with children with asthma , children with @entity3 have been described as lazier , less clever , and less caring , and they are also more likely to be stigmatised			2
’ having a diagnostic label often means teachers and parents have low academic expectations of them potentially creating a self fulfilling prophecy , she added			0
to be diagnosed with @entity3 , a patient should meet diagnostic criteria outlined in the @entity96 ’s @entity95 ( @entity97 ) - used around the world to classify mental disorders - or @entity100 ( @entity100 - 10 )			0
diagnosis : around three to seven per cent of children are believed to have adhd , about 400,000 , with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school ( picture posed by model ) but definitions have been broadened in successive editions of @entity97 , resulting in higher rates of the disorder when compared with @entity100 , although clinicians are likely to have got better at detecting and diagnosing @entity3 , some of the rise could stem from overdiagnosis or misdiagnosis			1
‘ severe cases of @entity3 are obvious , but in mild and moderate cases - which constitute the bulk of all adhd diagnoses - subjective opinions of clinicians differ ’ says dr @entity61			2
‘ the broadening of the diagnostic criteria in @entity97 is likely to increase what is already a significant concern about overdiagnosis			2
‘ it risks resulting in a diagnosis of @entity3 being regarded with scepticism to the harm of those with severe problems who unquestionably need sensitive , skilled specialist help and support ’ she added			0
prof @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , said the @entity53 was different because @entity143 guidelines already recommend careful specialist assessment , with psychological treatments given priority over medication in most cases			0
‘ probably too few children here get help ’ he said			0
in the @entity53 , the increase in stimulants was from a very low base rate : 4.8 per 1,000 schoolchildren in @entity53 compared with around 70 per 1,000 in parts of the @entity73			0
prof @entity138 said ‘ the increase in the @entity53 follows an increased ability in the medical profession to recognize @entity3 ; but all too many children with severe problems still go untreated			1
’ prof @entity162 , professor of molecular psychiatry at the @entity165 centre at the @entity140 , @entity166 , said ‘ this paper makes a set of arguments relating to the inappropriate use of the diagnostic criteria for adhd			0
‘ i would see their arguments as largely correct , and does explain the potential dangers of over diagnosis of @entity3			0
‘ however , they are not against the diagnosis and treatment of children with @entity3 when this has been properly evaluated by specialists			1

wider classification of adhd symptoms has seen rise in diagnosis
prescriptions for treatments increased twofold in children over five years
use of stimulant drugs such as @entity50 increase fourfold in adults
