your @entity0 guzzles more energy than your refrigerator			1
iphones burn through significantly more energy than a new mid-sized refrigerator , according to a new study			2
the average new mid-sized refrigerator uses about 322 kilowatt hours a year while your @entity0 uses about 361 kilowatt hours annually			1
the majority of that energy is n’t used to charge your battery , it ’s used to power data centers responsible for the wireless connections and data streaming that bring your device to life			1
this revelation was made in ‘ @entity19 , @entity21 networks , @entity22 and @entity23 , ’ a paper published by the technology investment advisory @entity26			0
energy guzzler : a customer shows her new @entity0 at the @entity29 in @entity30 the world ’s communications systems use 1,500 terawatt hours – 10 per cent of global energy and as much as @entity34 and @entity35 combined , according to the paper			1
the usage is equal to total global electricity usage in 1985			0
just one terawatt hour is enough to power roughly 90,000 homes for an entire year			2
with more and more devices being ‘ smart ’ or ‘ connected ’ each day , hourly internet traffic is expected to exceed annual internet traffic in the year 2000 , the paper says			0
a lot of energy is needed to power the world ’s communications backbone , and a lot more is going to be needed in the future as more and more server farms are fired up to stream @entity51 to whatever is in your pocket , backpack or purse			1
more efficient than an @entity0 : this refrigerator uses less energy than an iphone by 2035 , only slightly less energy will be needed to power ‘ the cloud ’ than for lights , the paper estimates			1
it takes more energy to stream a few episodes of @entity66 to your @entity0 than it does to stamp them onto a dvd and ship them to you , according to the paper			1
one of the world ’s largest consumers of cloud data , not surprisingly , is @entity76 , and it takes a lot of juice to handle all those iphones and @entity80			0
unfortunately , the bulk of this energy comes from coal , over 55 percent in @entity76 ’s case , according to @entity85			2
the suv of phones : iphones use more energy than refrigerators ‘ @entity92 ’s dominance arises from the importance of keeping costs down while providing ever - greater quantities of energy to the growing economies , and as the @entity99 recently noted , the absence of cost - effective alternatives at the scales the world needs , ’ says the paper			0
as long as coal continues to be the world ’s cheapest source of energy , it likely will also be the most used , further contributing to global warming			2
since global data usage is n’t going to drop , @entity76 might have the answer			0
@entity76 is working towards using 100 per cent renewable energy , and is already 75 per cent of the way there , according to its website			0
using solar , wind , hydroelectric and geothermal power sources , @entity76 has its sights on becoming as close to carbon neutral as possible – other companies should take note .			0

the majority of the energy is used for cloud services , not charging the @entity0
the majority of the energy used to power the cloud comes from coal
in the next two decades , servers will require almost as much energy as lights
