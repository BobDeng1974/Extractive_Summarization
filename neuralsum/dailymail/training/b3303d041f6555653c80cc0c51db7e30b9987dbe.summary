by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 25 january 2013 updated : 13:58 est , 25 january 2013 a hypersonic @entity1 capable of reaching 24 times the speed of sound and transporting passengers from @entity4 to @entity5 in 90 minutes could be with us by 2050			1
although the finished article is still a long way off , @entity7 , project coordinator for @entity1 at the @entity8 believes the project could attract private funding within a decade			0
the current concept includes a rocket booster stage for launch and a separate orbiter stage to carry up to 50 passengers halfway around the world without ever making it to space			1
it is expected to have a capacity for 50 passengers the @entity1 would take approximately eight minutes to climb to an altitude of 50 miles where it reach the earth 's upper atmosphere before breaking off from the liquid oxygen and hydrogen - fuelled rocket @entity35 shows proposed @entity1 journey routes			1
@entity4 to @entity37 would take approximately one hour a journey between @entity39 and the @entity40 would be reduced to just over 60 minutes , providing passengers are happy to pay space travel prices , estimated to be in the region of several hundred thousand dollars per ticket			0
should it take off in both sense of the word , there is no reason why a fleet of @entity51 could n't make up to 15 flights a day , believes @entity7			0
' maybe we can best characterise the @entity1 by saying it 's a kind of second - generation space shuttle , but with a completely different task , ' @entity7 told @entity57			1
the @entity1 would take approximately eight minutes to climb to an altitude of some 50 miles where it reach the earth 's upper atmosphere before gliding back to @entity62 at hypersonic speeds of more than 15,000mph			1
spaceliner engineers hope to use a liquid oxygen and hydrogen rocket fuel , leaving water vapour as waste			1
engineers predict that advances in materials could be combined with new cooling technologies and heat shielding to safeguard the @entity1 's structures against the intense heat of hypersonic flight			0
the @entity1 would likely require an isolated launch site and careful route planning to keep sonic booms from negatively affecting residential areas			2
here is an artist 's impression of it launching from @entity85 desert the @entity1 would likely require an isolated launch site and careful route planning to keep sonic booms from negatively affecting residential areas			2
the empty rocket stage from @entity1 would return to @entity62 after launch so that it could be reused			1
the plan would be for an aircraft to fly out and latch on to the rocket stage before towing it towards an airfield where it could glide in to land			0
once the @entity1 detaches from the rocket , the plan would be for an aircraft to fly out and latch on to the rocket mid-air before towing it towards an airfield where it could glide in to land one of the stumbling blocks experienced by the design team is the exact shape of the @entity1			2
its shape has to tolerate the extreme heat created by gliding at such high speeds through the @entity62 's upper atmosphere the glide back down will be a moment for passsengers to catch a glimpse of more familiar territory beyond the windows			1
ticket prices would not be cheap and could cost several hundred thousand pounds touchdown			0
a 90 minute journey time from @entity85 to @entity4 would change air travel as we know it @entity1 's eventually design could well be influenced by upcoming , @entity125 - funded study @entity127 ( @entity126 )			2
a close eye will also be on the success or failure of space ventures by the likes of @entity133			0
should space travel capture the interest of travellers , @entity7 is confident a fleet of @entity51 could make up to 15 flights a day			0
video imagining the day you can go from @entity4 to @entity5 in 90 minutes !			0

@entity1 would reach 24 times the speed of sound
will launch with the help of a liquid oxygen and hydrogen - fuelled rocket
it would take eight minutes to climb 50 miles to upper @entity62 , then break away from rocket before gliding down to destination
