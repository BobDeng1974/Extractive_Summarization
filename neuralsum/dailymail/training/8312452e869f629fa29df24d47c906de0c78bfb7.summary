she is married to an @entity13 , has done jury service twice and has voted at every election since she turned 18			0
but the 32 - year - old is officially not a citizen of the @entity4 because she is unable to prove that her father was in fact @entity4			1
denied : @entity7 has been told she is not eligible for a @entity4 passport despite having an @entity13 father her mother @entity21 met her father , @entity23 soldier @entity22 , at a @entity10 base in @entity25 , @entity12			1
however , because they had a turbulent relationship , ms @entity21 did not name mr @entity22 as @entity7 's father on her birth certificate			1
she later married another @entity4 soldier , @entity30 , and moved to the @entity4 when her daughter was seven			1
mrs @entity7 , who lives in @entity32 , @entity2 , says she regards herself as entirely @entity4 - but when she first applied for a passport , she discovered she was not entitled to one			1
baffled : mrs @entity7 , pictured left with her two daughters and right as a schoolgirl , had no idea she was n't @entity4 father : but @entity22 , pictured , was never named on his daughter 's birth certificate ' i was told i might not be a @entity4 citizen , ' she said			1
i was passed from passport information to border control and on to immigration			0
' at one point they told me i might be deported			2
i was scared they would just take me away from my family one day			0
' for some time i was claiming disability benefits due to a long - term health issue and they said i might have been ineligible and have to pay it all back			0

' mrs @entity7 later realised that the problem was that her father was not listed on her birth certificate - even though he had paid child support while she was growing up			1

' family : she lives in @entity32 , @entity2 with her two children @entity71 , left , and @entity72 , right she has met with @entity12 officials in an attempt to secure a @entity12 passport so she can travel abroad , but is adamant that the law should be changed to allow her to take @entity4 citizenship			1
as it currently stands , mrs @entity7 would have to take a test on ' life in the @entity4 ' in order to qualify for a @entity4 passport through residency and her marriage to @entity85 , her husband of five years			1
she added : ' it is absolutely ridiculous that i am being told that i should take a citizenship test with questions about @entity90 plays and naming kings and queens of old			2
' i am being made to pay because my biological father was not interested in hanging around			2
i spoke to officials at the @entity12 embassy and they just laughed and said , " why would you belong to us ? " - and they are right because i am @entity4			2
