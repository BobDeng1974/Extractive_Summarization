when renowned zoologist @entity1 , the inspiration behind the film @entity3 , was murdered in 1985 there were just 250 mountain gorillas left in @entity8 ’s @entity7 mountains			1
but 27 years on , numbers of the gentle giants have doubled , thanks to a group of doctors that her work inspired			2
the gorilla doctors , formed as the @entity18 a year after @entity1 's death , take care of injured and critically ill gorillas and provide medical treatment and quarantine of orphans , with as many as eight gorillas cared for at any one time			1
the group rescue gorillas from poacher 's snares or when they have been exposed to potentially fatal human viruses , darting the animals with antibiotics or drugging them and operating on the jungle floor			1
they have been led for the past 13 years by dr @entity65 , a faculty member of the @entity66 of the @entity67 and divides his time between @entity69 in @entity70 and central @entity8			1
but he admits that there are dangers working with such large animals			0
he said : ' if the gorilla screams when darted , there is usually chaos and the silverbacks rush in to protect them			0
' his ' closest call ' came after darting a mother with a sleeping drug so he could treat her sick infant			0
he said : ' because it was so young i tried to work on it without anaesthetising it but it kept screaming and screaming			0
' emergency treatment : gorilla doctors treat an adult @entity92 wounded : dr @entity93 ( far right ) and dr @entity94 ( far left ) remove a bullet from the leg of an orphan @entity98 's gorilla confiscated from poachers in @entity47 , @entity8 gentle : a young gorilla chewing on a branch in the @entity7 in @entity47			1
the number of mountain gorillas has doubled since the @entity17 group was founded in 1986 @entity105 : an adult @entity92 seen with a baby in the @entity7 in @entity47 - the gentle giants have doubled in number since 1985 thanks to a group of gorilla doctors ' a silverback had circled by and here i was holding his screaming baby			1
this silverback was probably about 10 yards from me and was getting very , very close to charging			0
' it was one of those moments when our eyes caught and it could have gone either way and it would have been pretty severe			0
' so , i just quietly put the baby on the mother and backed off until the trackers and guides were able to come around in a circle to protect me			0
' the gorilla doctors have carried out more than 150 medical interventions on wild gorillas and adopted more than 20 orphans , many of whom need 24 - hour - care suffering from dehydration , mental distress and wounds dr @entity30 and dr @entity94 are among the doctors who inspect these young mountain gorillas and @entity98 ’s gorilla at the @entity141 in @entity47			1
the @entity17 ’ outstanding work continues to see mountain gorilla populations rise , while other great apes , such as orangutans , decline			1
gentle giant : an adult mountain gorilla is seen during the @entity40 project in @entity33 looked after : the gorilla doctors have carried out more than 150 medical interventions on wild gorillas and adopted more than 20 orphans cute : two young wild @entity98 's gorillas seen playing in @entity152 in @entity47 rescuers : the doctors swoop in to rescue the gentle giants when they are trapped in poacher snares or exposed to deadly human viruses the last four years have seen the vets and scientists employ increasingly advanced techniques , which they hope will help all critically endangered species , not just gorillas			2
the regions the gorilla doctors operate in are also one of the most turbulent in the world and has been marred by genocide and war			0
in the past six months the team have been unable to monitor the gorillas because @entity172 rebels , locked in a battle with @entity47 government forces , have taken over much of the @entity175			2
they can not say if any @entity176 have been killed in crossfire or hunted for meat during this period			0
however , dr @entity65 believes most of the fighters see the financial and altruistic benefits of protecting the gorillas , and will not harm them indiscriminately			2
aside from increasing the gorilla populations , his proudest achievement is seeing talented @entity8 vets ‘ blossoming ’ and becoming independent			2
dr @entity65 hopes they can eventually double the population of mountain gorillas to more than 1,500			1
it is expensive work at an estimated cost of £ 600,000 per year but dr @entity65 believes it is worth every penny			0
he added : ' it is extremely important to safeguard the mountain gorillas , our close relatives , for so many reasons , if not just as a symbol that conservation can work and save a magnificent species but also as a financial treasure to the host countries			1
' you can support gorilla doctors by giving a donation and follow them on @entity210			0
