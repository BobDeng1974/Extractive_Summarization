@entity0 was always going to get runs again at some stage			1
he is too good a player not to do that , but this was an important day for him , his mind - set and his status within the @entity8 team			1
no - one would want to go through what @entity0 has been experiencing and the reaction of the crowd when he was out showed how much this innings meant to the cricketing public			2
he is a likeable lad who people want to do well and to play an innings like he did under huge pressure shows what a mentally tough young man he is			0
relief : @entity0 was back amongst the runs on day one of the third @entity22 against @entity23 agonsing : @entity0 was out for 95 on day one of the third @entity22 against @entity23 at the @entity24 video a great day for @entity8 - @entity0 but @entity25 does not change anything			1
we all want to see @entity8 ’s best batsman , the man who will go on to become their leading runscorer , making scores consistently and the issue is how they get him playing like that all the time			2
one innings does not mean all his problems are solved			2
@entity8 eventually have to make a decision on @entity0			1
getting him back to his best as a batsman is still more important to the team than his captaincy			1
he went past @entity42 and @entity43 on sunday and he will go past @entity44 and many other stars of the world game as long as his batting returns to its best			0
that means more to @entity8 than his leadership			0
he can get runs while he ’s captain but it ’s how @entity8 get the most out of him and in the back of @entity0 ’s mind would have been the feeling he was not contributing , which is horrible for a captain			1
focus : @entity0 was given a couple of chances , but fought hard for his 95 runs relief : @entity0 won the toss and decided to bat first on a greenish looking pitch in @entity64 all the reassurances from your team - mates do not mean anything if you believe you are not pulling your weight , especially when @entity8 are in such desperate need of a victory			1
@entity0 ’s technical problems were still evident at times at the @entity24 and the issue is how we ensure his mind is crystal clear , as it was on sunday , while he works out the best way to score lots of runs			1
he was trying to get much further forward and that is not easy for @entity0 who has always been a back - foot player			2
he can not suddenly start playing like @entity83 and it will take a lot of physical and mental effort to correct this weakness , which has been exploited by bowlers			0
ovation : @entity8 's under - pressure captain received a warm reception from the crowd on his way : the @entity8 captain trudges off after falling five runs short of a century he had a bit of luck but he deserved that after all the previous bad luck			1
things even themselves out and good things happen to good people			0
it would have been lovely if he had scored a century but he must think about his 95 and how he would have felt had he been caught by @entity105 for 15			0
now he has to keep on working to become the @entity0 we know and respect because there were only glimpses of it on sunday			2
he needs to develop this different way of batting			0
it ’s a work in progress			0
what this innings does is buy him time and clears the bees in his head			0
@entity0 ’s brain will not be as scrambled the next time he bats .			0

@entity0 was always going to score runs at some stage
his innings on sunday was important for his status within the team
@entity0 's technical problems still evident , but his mind was clear
getting @entity0 back to his batting best more important to @entity8 than his captaincy
