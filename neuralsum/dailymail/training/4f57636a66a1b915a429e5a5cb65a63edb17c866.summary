a year after losing her sister to cystic fibrosis , a 17 - year - old girl has received a life - changing vest to combat the same condition thanks to the generosity of people in a @entity8 town			1
cystic fibrosis makes breathing difficult for @entity11 's @entity10 as a sticky mucus develops in her lungs and the best way to improve her quality of life was to get a $ 20,000 vest that needed to be imported from the @entity17			1
the percussion vest means @entity10 's lung capacity will go from 55 per cent up to 90 per cent , along with physiotherapy and other treatments			1
to help pay for the vest , @entity10 and her family kick started a campaign to raise the money			2
but four months into fundraising efforts , the @entity25 hit a snag and donations dried up , just $ 7,000 away from their goal			0
cystic fibrosis sufferer @entity10 , 17 , has received a $ 20,000 vest that will help improve her quality of life this is when @entity11 's @entity35 stepped in and helped make up the rest of the funds			1
without the vest , @entity10 's father , @entity38 , said his daughter could visit the hospital up to six times a year , staying about two to three weeks at a time			1
' it depends on her environment			0
if she was exposed to the cold or something like that then she would go more when they could n’t treat her with antibiotics , ' he told @entity51			0
both @entity38 and @entity10 said they were grateful for all the support they had received			2
' it shows that no matter where you live you have a good community behind you and when you ask for support they ’ll support you , ' @entity10 said			2
' receiving the vest , at the end day , i ’ll live a longer and healthier life and get the mucus off my chest			2
' this glimmer of hope comes after the one - year anniversary of the death of @entity10 's sister , @entity70 , who lost her battle with cystic fibrosis in may last year at just 18 years old			1
the vest was donated to the @entity74 by @entity11 's @entity35 @entity75 ( left ) died last year from cystic fibrosis , the same condition her sister , @entity10 ( right ) , is now fighting both siblings were diagnosed at birth - @entity70 in 1994 and @entity10 in 1997			1
their father , @entity38 , said they were heartbreaking blows to the family			0
' when [ the hospital ] told us about @entity85 ... they did n’t know what to say to us , ' he said			0
' we had n’t heard of it before			0
' to make a long story short , they told us to enjoy her while we still could because she was not going to have a long life			0
' most kids back then would not see their teenage years			0
' and with @entity10 , it did not get any easier			2
' we were devastated about @entity10 because we saw what @entity70 had to go through			1
there were no words for it , ' mr @entity95 said			0
' we decided we did n’t want to have any kids because of that reason			0
' but due to technological advances , pregnant women were able to be tested to see if their babies would have cystic fibrosis			1
so the @entity105 had two more kids , 10 - year - old @entity107 and 11 - year - old @entity108 - who are carriers of the illness ' gene but do not have the condition			1
but even if they did have cystic fibrosis , mr @entity95 said they would still have had @entity114 and @entity38 because he and his second wife did not believe in abortion			1
the @entity10 family - @entity108 , 11 , @entity10 , 17 , @entity117 and @entity107 , 10 - have turned their experiences with cystic fibrosis into something positive @entity10 ( pictured here with her dad , @entity38 ) and her family have been trying to raise money for the vest that needed to be imported from the @entity17 while most families would find it hard to stay positive through such tough times , the @entity105 have used their experiences to raise awareness about the illness			1
' @entity10 and myself feel very strongly about raising awareness of cystic fibrosis and educating people about this horrible illness as there is still no cure , ' mr @entity95 said			1
' i lost my daughter @entity70 to cystic fibrosis last year ... and i 'm not going to lose another daughter			1
' i 'm so lucky @entity10 has a very positive outlook on life and is very compliant with her treatment			0
' mr @entity95 said he wanted to raise more awareness because there needed to be more government support for families who were dealing with the devastating illness			0
' it was n’t easy in the first six months when @entity70 passed away and we used that to further our determination , ' he said			0
' there ’s a lot of treatment and medication overseas and those with it overseas have a longer life span than those with it in @entity163			0
' with treatments like the vest we have it ’s non-existent [ in @entity163 ] unless people do what we did by fundraising or buying it from the @entity17 directly , but the government does n’t help at all			2
' the illness means @entity10 has trouble breathing because a sticky mucus develops in her lungs mr @entity95 said he was also lobbying health minister @entity176 to put a medication that would improve the lifestyle of cystic fibrosis sufferers on the @entity180			1
' @entity181 is available overseas in the @entity17 and the @entity182 , and it ’s a tablet that improves lung function and improves weight gain , ' he said			2
' to buy it privately it costs $ 300,000 a year in @entity163			0
' kids are dying because we do n’t have this medication [ readily available ] in @entity163			0
' but the most important thing to @entity10 about raising awareness of the disease is making sure no one living with cystic fibrosis feels isolated			1
' we want everyone that has cystic fibrosis to know you 're not alone , and to keep up with your treatments and your medications because if you do n’t you wo n’t have a longer or healthier life , ' she said .			2
