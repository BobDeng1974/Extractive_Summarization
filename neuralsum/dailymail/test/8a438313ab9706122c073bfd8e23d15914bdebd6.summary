@entity0 have been brilliant in the second half of the season but the defeat at @entity4 was a timely reminder that they still have a long way to go			1
@entity0 played like @entity7 on a bad day – they were that horrendous			2
recently i wrote about what @entity0 need to take them back to a proper challenge for domestic and @entity13 glory			2
now it 's time to name names			2
teams will have bad days , of course			0
it 's no surprise to those of us who can see his quality and importance to @entity0 , but without @entity24 they look far more beatable			1
i ca n't see how @entity4 score that first goal if @entity24 is on the pitch			1
@entity27 needs some big signings in the summer to turn @entity0 into title contenders @entity31 's midfield pair of @entity32 ( left ) and @entity33 ( right ) fit the bill @entity35 is a poverty - stricken pauper 's version of @entity24 in that position			1
the @entity39 is a slower version of the @entity41 , which is quite an achievement , and so more reinforcements are needed			2
that 's why it would be a good idea for @entity0 to raid @entity31			1
@entity32 has already been linked with a move to @entity48 – it 's a no - brainer			1
this player is physical yet graceful			0
he can spot a pass and execute it first time			0
he 's dynamic and never hides			0
alongside him in that @entity31 midfield is @entity33 - the @entity54			1
these players make relatively few tackles because they anticipate and intercept – they read the game			0
@entity35 struggled to cope in @entity0 's midfield during their 3 - 0 defeat by @entity4 @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 react after conceding a goal in a big defeat by @entity4 on sunday but when @entity33 tackles , the opponent knows about it – he is a beast			1
despite his frame ( he 's 6ft 1in , slightly shorter than @entity24 ) , he is quick to step into a tackle			1
opponents think they have a bit of time on the ball but @entity33 makes up the ground in a flash to rob them			2
what i 'm saying here is that @entity0 may need two players to replace @entity24			1
and those two fit the bill			0
both are winners , both have had years in @entity31 playing some magnificent football			0
and if @entity27 is raiding @entity31 he might as well sign @entity86 's finest @entity85			1
what a playmaker this guy is – he floats around picking the ball up wherever he can , gets the team into advanced positions and can spot a pass			0
he can score goals too			0
@entity0 look far more vulnerable without @entity24 in their midfield @entity86 creative threat @entity85 has been linked with a move to the @entity97 before @entity32 , like @entity33 , could be leaving @entity31 this summer along with departing manager @entity98 i think he 's a more positive version of @entity101 – look how often the @entity102 gave the ball away at @entity104 on sunday			1
there 's a lot to admire about @entity101 's game , but he is one of the guilty ones when you look at the reasons for @entity0 being ponderous in their build - up			1
@entity0 also need a centre half and another striker – it 's a work in progress after the @entity116 collapse			2
but the @entity31 trio would bring instant reward for @entity119			0
and it 's not just plucking names out of nowhere : the timing is right for them to move on just as manager @entity98 leaves			0
there is a way any @entity0 team must play – @entity128 found that out to his cost , and earlier this season @entity119 listened to the fans ' loud and clear disapproval of negative football and passes going backwards too often and changed the way they played			2
hoofing it up to @entity138 has happened – not as often as the critics make out – but with certain players out , @entity119 has felt that tactic is the best way to get results			0
@entity119 knows anything less than a top - four finish is failure			0
@entity101 was wasteful in possession against @entity4 at @entity104 on sunday @entity85 ( right ) challenges @entity149 's @entity148 during a @entity151 game @entity138 's rebirth has been a big factor in @entity0 's excellent form over the past weeks so much has been made of @entity31 's poor season , but even during that time they managed to finish top of their @entity158 group above @entity159			1
and the second half of the campaign has seen a revival that has led them to the top half when before @entity166 relegation looked a possibility			0
these are not bad players just because of half a season			0
these are players who , if they successfully bring their a game with them from @entity173 , could improve @entity0 's starting xi massively			1
if @entity0 are going to raid a club for good players , there are some rich pickings at @entity31			2
and i have n't even mentioned @entity180 .			0

defeat by @entity4 showed that @entity0 have a long way to go
@entity35 is a poverty - stricken pauper 's version of @entity24
@entity0 should bring in @entity33 and @entity32 in midfield
playmaker @entity85 would also improve @entity27 's side
