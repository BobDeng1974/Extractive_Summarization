a virus that usually attacks algae , has been found in the throats of humans and researchers believe that it may produce a subtle change in an infected people 's cognitive function			1
the virus called @entity10 is typically found in algae and seems to be responsible for poorer spatial awareness and a shorter attention span in affected humans			1
the discovery sheds new light on a class of viruses that has been previously been deemed non-infectious to humans , highlighting the ability of certain microorganisms to trigger delicate physiologic changes without causing full - blown disease			1
a virus called @entity10 - 1 that usually attacks algae ( pictured ) , has been found in the throats of humans and researchers believe that it may produce a subtle change in an infected people 's cognitive function ‘ this is a striking example showing that the “ innocuous ” microorganisms we carry can affect behaviour and cognition , ' said lead author of the @entity31 - published study , dr @entity32 , a virologist and paediatric infectious disease specialist at @entity34			1
he and colleagues from the @entity41 stumbled across the algae virus by accident while they were studying microbes living in the throats of healthy humans for a non-related study			1
by analysing the dna of swabs , they discovered dna matching that of @entity10 - 1 ( @entity51 virus 1 ) , known to infect green algae , which includes more than 7,000 water - dwelling organisms resembling plants that are commonly found in ponds , lakes and the sea			1
a total of 40 people from the 92 participating in the study tested positive for the algae virus			2
mice infected with the virus exhibited deficits similar to those observed in humans , including recognition memory and spatial awareness the researchers found that people infected with @entity10 performed ' measurbly lower ' in a set of tasks measuring the speed and accuracy of visual processing , than healthy people			1
for example , people who harboured the virus scored , on average , nearly nine points lower on a test that measured how quickly they could draw a line between sequentially numbered circles on a piece of paper			0
viral carriers also scored an average of seven points lower on tests measuring attention			0
to extend the study , the scientists infected a group of mice and analysed their performance during a battery of tests designed to measure their brain power			0
animals infected with the virus exhibited deficits similar to those observed in humans , including lesser recognition memory and spatial awareness			2
for example , they found it more difficult to navigate a maze and spent 30 per cent less time examining a new object than healthy mice - a finding that suggests a shorter attention span			1
while the scientists are cautious in linking mouse behaviour with that of humans , they say that the similarities seen in the tests are ‘ striking ’			2
dr @entity120 , director of the @entity121 and @entity122 at the university , said : ‘ the similarity of our findings in mice and humans underscores the common mechanisms that many microbes use to affect cognitive function in both animals and people			0
’ ‘ this commonality is precisely what allows us to study the pathologies that these microorganisms fuel and do so in a controlled systematic way			0
’ analysis of brain samples from virus - infected mice revealed changes in the expression of multiple genes found in the hippocampus , which is the part of the brain that sorts and catalogues short - term and long - term memories and guides spatial orientation			2
@entity10 - 1 , or @entity51 virus 1 , is usually found in algae living in ponds , lakes and the sea			1
until now , it was thought to non-infectious to humans			2
now , scientists say that when it infects humans , it may be responsible for cognitive decline			0
this includes a drop in poor spatial awareness and a shorter attention span			1
while the difference was not dramatic , performance in certain tests measuring cognitive function were ' measurably lower '			0
the virus also seems to change the expression of multiple genes found in the hippocampus , which is the part of the brain that sorts and catalogues short - term and long - term memories and guides spatial orientation			2
the discovery sheds new light on class of viruses that has been previously been deemed non-infectious to humans , highlighting the ability of certain microorganisms to trigger delicate physiologic changes without causing full - blown disease			1
the new findings follow several recent studies showing that microbes can play an important role in the origin of cognitive and mental health disorders			0
for example , some have previously shown that infection with the cat - borne parasite @entity200 ( pictured ) can alter behaviour in genetically predisposed people some of these alterations involved genes that regulate brain response to dopamine - a neurotransmitter that affects a wide range of cognitive functions - as well as genes involved in immune cell regulation			0
because multiple genes are involved , the scientists think that numerous mechanisms may explain the effects seen in the study			0
the new findings follow several recent studies showing that microbes can play an important role in the origin of neurologic , cognitive and mental health disorders			0
for example , dr @entity32 and others have previously shown that infection with the cat - borne parasite @entity200 can alter behaviour in genetically predisposed people .			0

the virus , called @entity10 - 1 , is typically found in algae - but it has also been detected in the throats of healthy humans
could be to blame for poorer spatial awareness and a short attention span
