@entity0 does n't need me to defend him , but i 'm not writing this specifically for him			1
some people have a grudge against others because of events in the past			2
clearly when @entity10 launched his verbal assault on under - pressure @entity0 before the derby at @entity14 there was more to it than a well - thought - out football observation			1
@entity0 revealed all after his @entity18 side beat @entity14			1
he 'd dropped @entity19 when manager at @entity22 – hence the revenge			2
@entity0 was under pressure after a poor run of results that had seen them slip to 13th in the table @entity0 celebrates as @entity28 equalises for @entity18 in the second half @entity0 celebrates wildly after @entity31 's late winning goal as @entity18 beat rivals @entity14 2 - 1 @entity0 is n't the only person who did n't rate @entity10 , believe me			1
i 've always judged @entity0 on the football : as a player , he was everything a fan , a manager and a team - mate would want : passionate , talented and ready to go to war for his colleagues and friends			1
before last summer i 'd interviewed @entity0 but never met him properly			1
he worked with us for @entity44 out in @entity45 at the @entity46			2
i 'd heard that he did n't suffer fools gladly , so i was behind the eight ball form the start			2
@entity10 said @entity18 manager @entity0 is ' not a great coach ' and ' not a great tactician ' @entity19 claims people say ' wow , it 's @entity0 , legend ' but players quickly suss out the former left back on his first evening we finished work and a group of us went out for a meal			1
i 'd said a lot of things on air about @entity0 and i wanted to tackle him off air			1
to my delight he was right up for it , so after a brief bit of small - talk about our shared love of @entity68 ( he thinks @entity69 is the best album , i 'm more of a @entity72 fan myself ) , we launched into it head - on			0
why did you think putting @entity76 up front when @entity22 needed a goal was a good idea ? is your football too route one ? why did so many players pull out of your under 21 squads ? i was on a roll , but so was @entity0 , and as pizza went cold we batted our views back and forth			1
it was one of my most enjoyable evenings of a brilliant and memorable trip			0
goalkeeper @entity76 came on as a forward during a @entity22 match in 2005 @entity22 goalkeeper @entity76 was used as a forward in the final minutes against @entity93 i think he was surprised that someone had actually had the bottle to say these things to his face – so many have written them , and conveniently forgotten them when confronted with @entity0 himself			1
his mistrust of the press came up early during the conversation in the pizzeria			0
overall i got some decent answers to my questions and he passionately defended himself as you 'd expect			0
and i think he was pleased to get the chance to state his case			0
we agreed to disagree on many issues			0
@entity0 then travelled around @entity45 for a few days commentating on games for @entity44 while i was based at the @entity114 and the @entity115			1
@entity0 and @entity117 chat in @entity45 during the @entity118 for @entity44 on his return i was intrigued to see how he would react after our verbal sparring			2
the ice was broken after i caught him singing ' @entity123 ' by @entity124			0
it 's one of those songs where i know all the words as well , another shared musical love of ours			0
@entity0 then sat down and gave me an interview of which i am very proud			2
it was in response to yet another @entity135 failure at a @entity46 and listeners later told me they hung on his every word , even if they did n't agree with all of them			0
that might have been part of his job , so the true test was when i turned up at a @entity18 game this season			2
i was n't expecting @entity0 to join me for a post-match interview up in the press box – he was certainly under no obligation to make the trip up to the back of the stand			2
but he did , and it was good to see him again			0
@entity0 joined @entity117 for a post-match interview in the press box aftrer a @entity18 match we 're not best buddies or anything as unprofessional and cosy as that			1
and i still think he 's got a lot to prove as a manager			0
but he 's without doubt a man of integrity , and an honest , passionate guy			0
he does n't need or deserve individuals with a grudge blasting him			0
if he fails , it should be because of things he gets wrong rather than something @entity19 has held against him for years			0
i do like @entity0 and i hope he takes @entity18 back to the @entity172			1
but i 'm still not having @entity76 up front			0
@entity0 does n't need defending as , if he fails , it should be for football reasons and not for a grudge @entity0 is ' not a great coach , not a great tactician and not a great motivator ' , according to @entity19			1

@entity10 said @entity0 is ' not a great coach , not a great tactician '
@entity0 has been under pressure lately after a string of *bad* results
@entity18 beat @entity14 on *saturday* to give him *breathing* space
