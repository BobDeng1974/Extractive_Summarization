by @entity0 published : 05:07 est , 4 july 2012 updated : 14:18 est , 4 july 2012 conspiracy : @entity2 died in a @entity4 hospital from a mystery illness in 2004 the body of the late @entity8 leader @entity2 may be exhumed over claims he was assassinated with a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium			1
the @entity13 has agreed to the exhumation of his body from a mausoleum in @entity18 on the @entity19 so the claim can be investigated			0
@entity2 died in 2004 from a mystery illness , amid theories that he was killed at the hands of @entity25 spy agency @entity24			1
but a new investigation has concluded that a urine stain on @entity2 's underwear had traces of @entity30 , the highly radioactive substance which killed @entity32 dissident @entity31 six years ago			1
the 75 - year - old 's widow , @entity33 , has called for her late husband 's body to be exhumed after the @entity38 investigation found the traces on clothes he wore in his final days			1
previous theories had speculated that @entity2 , who died in a @entity4 hospital in november 2004 , had contracted cancer , cirrhosis , or even @entity45			1
but tests carried out by the @entity47 in @entity48 , @entity49 , showed that @entity2 's underwear registered a level of 180 millibecquerels of @entity52 - 210 , more than 20 times the dose to kill an average human being			1
dr @entity55 , the director of the institute , confirmed to @entity38 that there had been an ' unexplained , elevated amount ' of polonium found on the former leader			0
the @entity38 documentary revealed that @entity52 was found on @entity2 's underwear , kaffiyeh headscarf , and even his toothbrush			1
@entity38 had sent @entity2 's clothes to the institute to test them , after obtaining them from his widow as part of a nine - month investigation into his death			2
in most cases there are no serious symptoms for a week after being exposed , but nausea and fatigue would set in soon after			0
in theory , just a microgram of @entity52 - the same as a spec of dust - is enough to kill someone , due to its slowly - excreted alpha particles which affect the body 's organs			1
after ingestion , @entity52 affects the liver , kidneys , spleen , bone marrow , and gastrointestinal tract			0
serious illness would not be expected for a month , due to the amount of time it takes to accumulate dangerous internal exposures			0
as the severity of the exposure develops in the body , victims usually lose hair , and the lining of the gastrointestinal system is destroyed			0
this later leads to severe diarrhea , intestinal bleeding , loss of fluids , and disturbance of electrolyte balance			0
though it takes 5 - 6 weeks to seriously affect most , the symptoms of @entity52 poisoning contrast to the case of @entity31 ( above ) , who fell ill the day after he was exposed			2
the @entity32 died 23 days after being exposed , an indication that he was poisoned with many times the required lethal dosage			2
@entity136 said the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume @entity2 's body to test it for polonium - 210			2
' but we have to do it quite fast because polonium is decaying , so if we wait too long , for sure , any possible proof will disappear , ' he told @entity38			0
it emerged today that @entity8 are ready to accept a medical examination of @entity2 's body if his family agrees , according to a @entity8 official			1
the comments from @entity149 , who led a @entity8 probe into @entity2 's death , came just hours after the @entity38 investigation showed the @entity8 leader might have been poisoned with the radioactive substance polonium			1
the official told @entity155 : ' after the @entity38 broadcast i met today with president ( @entity160 ) @entity159 and recommended accepting an analysis of the body of the martyr president @entity2 , and @entity159 for his part agreed on the condition that the family ... accepts			0
' @entity52 was found to have caused the death of former @entity32 spy @entity31 in @entity168 in 2006 , and he was assumed to have been deliberately poisoned			1
@entity2 's widow @entity33 said she would ask for @entity2 's body - buried in the @entity19 town of @entity18 , seat of the @entity8 self - rule authority - to be exhumed			1
speaking at the end of the documentary , aired on @entity38 's @entity177 and @entity178 channels , she said : ' we have to go further and exhume @entity2 's body to reveal the truth to all the @entity183 and @entity184 world			2
' @entity2 led the @entity186 's fight against @entity25 from the 1960s but signed a peace agreement with the jewish state in 1993 establishing @entity8 self - rule areas in the @entity19 and @entity190			2
his mysterious death came four years into a @entity8 uprising , after years of talks with @entity25 failed to lead to a @entity8 state			0
@entity79 doctors who treated @entity2 in his final days could not establish the cause of death			0
@entity79 officials refused to give details of his condition , citing privacy laws , fuelling a host of rumours and theories over the nature of his illness .			0
