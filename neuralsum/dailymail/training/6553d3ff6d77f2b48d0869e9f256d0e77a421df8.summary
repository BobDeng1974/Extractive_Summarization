by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 15:30 est , 25 december 2013 @entity3 : 09:47 est , 26 december 2013 an 87 - year - old multimillionaire who jumped to his death from his luxury apartment building on the edge of @entity8 on monday was described by neighbors as frugal despite his incredible generosity to charity			1
@entity12 committed suicide on monday at @entity15 building on @entity16 in @entity17			1
he had recently suffered a stroke and his health was failing			1
friends said that mr @entity12 , who made almost a billion dollars from his hedge fund on @entity22 , was frugal - despite being so generous to environmental and educational causes			1
planned : @entity12 deliberately gave hundreds of millions of dollars of his fortune away in the years before his death on monday and told friends he wanted to have it all gone when he died neighbor @entity27 told the @entity28 : ' @entity12 , for all his money , never took cabs , never took a limo			1
he always took the subway			2
' on the few occasions when he did grab a cab , he would usually share a cab with someone in the building			0
he shared a cab with my wife and insisted that she pay half			2
' @entity12 had a personal fortune of about $ 800million - but the openly gay aetheist recently told friends he had given all but $ 100million to charity			1
he apparently could not give away the rest because it was tied up in long - term investments			0
he jumped from his 16th - floor apartment in the luxury @entity15 building on @entity17 's @entity50 on monday			2
a police source told the @entity28 that he had left a suicide note which read : ' i had a rewarding life			0
thank you and goodbye to all my friends			2
please make sure you cancel all my plans			0
tell everyone what i did			0
i ’m not ashamed of killing myself			0
' friends saw signs that he may do something drastic as he suffered a debilitating stroke about a month ago and began unloading his fortune in droves			1
the multi-millionaire did not have any children and his 35 - year marriage ended well before his death			0
home : @entity12 had owned his 16th floor apartment in the historic @entity15 building since 1978 and he jumped off the balcony to his death on monday the paper reports that he has donated more than $ 100million a piece to four different charities : the nature conservancy , the @entity82 , the @entity83 and the @entity84			1
' he was the most committed person i have ever known , ' @entity84 president @entity85 said to @entity87			0
' more than his financial contributions , he brought an astute mind and sharp wit to the organization			0
he will be missed greatly and long remembered as a visionary donor			2
' the idea of saving the environment was one that @entity12 had spoken about previously , and in a 2011 interview , he told @entity96 that much of the $ 600million he had given to charity at that point was directed towards those groups			1
' the idea of " but for my money , it would be gone forever " appeals , ' he said then at the age of 84			0
another issue that appealed to him - and was close to his purse strings - was an investment in @entity109 's catholic schools			1
the felt that the tuition at the schools , which were going through financial issues , showed an immediate ' return ' and he gave $ 20million to a fund earmarked for that cause			0
' i ’m an atheist , but i think the schools are especially good , ' he said to the @entity96			0
before the stroke : @entity12 , seen here in his colorfully - decorated apartment in 2010 , donated hundreds of millions of dollars to environmental and educational causes he was also proud of the apartment where he lived , making it less of a shock that he chose that as his final resting place			1
he had owned the apartment since 1978 and his attention to detail and fine art collection has helped him decorate it and refurbish it so that his original price - $ 300,000 - is just a fraction of what he estimated it 's worth in 2011 - $ 20million			0
@entity12 is one of many millionaires who live in the building , as @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 have all had apartments in the building			1
the apartment has views of @entity8 , and @entity12 clearly relished looking out at the trees and the lake			1
' who needs a summer place ? i 've got one , ' he said to the @entity96 reporter			0
