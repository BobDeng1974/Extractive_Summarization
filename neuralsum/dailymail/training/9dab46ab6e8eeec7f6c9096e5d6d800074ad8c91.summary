by @entity1 reporter last updated at 2:09 am on 30th december 2011 @entity3 scientists and air carriers are on alert as one of the state ’s volcanoes belched a monstrous ash plume 15,000 feet in the air thursday			1
@entity11 in @entity3 's @entity12 sent up an ash cloud that prompted scientists to increase the alert level for commercial aircraft traffic , as an eruption could happen soon			1
once plumes reach 20,000 feet , the airline industry and the @entity20 really start to worry			1
spewing and sputtering : the remote volcano in @entity3 's @entity12 spouted an ash cloud 15,000 feet into the sky , prompting an air - traffic alert @entity11 's last major eruption was in 2001			1
it has had bursts of activity nearly every year since then and the ash cloud thursday was not out of character			2
scientists say that while the giant plume is n’t unexpected , the volcano ’s remote location on @entity3 ’s @entity12 makes it difficult to monitor			1
' unfortunately , @entity39 is one of those that is so remote , we have no on - ground monitoring or instrumentation there , so it 's hard for us to pinpoint things any more accurately than we can do with satellite imagery , ’ @entity37 scientist - in - charge @entity36 said			2
the event thursday drew strong interest from air carriers			0
' any time you put an ash cloud up into the atmosphere , the airlines , the air carriers , air freight companies - it 's a major concern , ' mr @entity36 said			1
smoke in the sky : a true - color satellite image of @entity11 captures the ash cloud the @entity60 said satellite images at 4.02am @entity3 time showed @entity11 had spewed ash 15,000 feet into the air in a cloud that moved east - southeast			1
mr @entity36 called it a small explosion			0
' it 's not expected to cause a disruption to big international air carriers , ' he said			0
however , it was significant enough to raise the alert level from yellow , representing elevated unrest , to orange , representing an increased potential of eruption , or an eruption under way with minor ash emissions or no emissions			1
@entity11 is a 5,675 - foot foot peak on uninhabited @entity83 about 940 miles southwest of @entity84			1
drifter : a drifting ash cloud from @entity11 shows the ash cloud ( yellow ) drifting on the southwest tip of @entity90 the nearest village is @entity92 on another island about 50 miles east			1
previous eruptions of @entity11 were not considered a threat to @entity92 and its 18 permanent residents			1
scientists in july noted increased activity in the crater at the summit of the volcano			2
satellite images showed lava building and forming a dome - shaped accumulation			0
the @entity20 and the airline industry get concerned for trans - @entity108 flights when an ash cloud has the potential to exceed the 20,000 - foot threshold , as @entity11 has done in the past			1
@entity3 's @entity114 blew on dec. 15 , 1989 , and sent ash 150 miles away into the path of a @entity118 jet carrying 231 passengers			2
its four engines flamed out and the jet dropped more than 2 miles , from 27,900 feet to 13,300 feet , before the crew was able to restart all engines and land the plane safely at @entity84			0
the observatory is working with the @entity125 to monitor lightning above @entity11 , which could signal a major ash plume			1
the cause is linked to the interaction of ash and warm air			2
@entity132 of the @entity37 said in september that lava domes form a lid on a volcano 's ' plumbing , ' including the chamber holding the magma			0
when they grow big enough , lava domes can become unstable and will sometimes collapse			0
when the magma chamber decompresses it can lead to an explosion as the conduit inside the volcano suddenly becomes unsealed and gasses escape			0
radar images earlier this month showed the dome had cracked and subsided , mr @entity36 said			0
' there 's a whole lot of hot air and it rises through the atmosphere very quickly , ' mr @entity36 said			0
' all the ash particles rub together and develop electrical charges , and that discharges as lightning			0
the eruption thursday was not large enough to create lightning			0
seismic activity at nearby volcanoes could also signal an explosion at @entity11 , the observatory said			2
the observatory is a joint program between the @entity37 , the @entity164 and the state @entity165			0
it was formed in response to the 1986 eruption of @entity170 .			0

@entity11 released 15,000 ft ash plume
last eruption of remote volcano was in 2001
@entity178 airlines concerned when ash clouds reach 20,000 ft
