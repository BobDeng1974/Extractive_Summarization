several big name beauty companies have been forced to remove a logo that declares them free of animal cruelty after they decided to sell their products in @entity6			1
@entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 are among the high end brands that can no longer use the internationally - recognised official @entity12 logo to show their cosmetics are free from animal testing			1
it comes after the firms decided to start selling to @entity6 where animal testing on beauty products for human use is still required by law			1
going global : big - name beauty brands have changed their animal testing policies so they can start selling their products in @entity6 ( posed by model ) cosmetic sales in @entity6 increased by 18 per cent to £ 10billion last year - making it an attractive financial prospect			1
but many companies selling their products in the country have been asked to fund animal testing of their products in @entity6 laboratories in order for them to be sold to the public			1
@entity35 chief executive @entity34 said : ' the @entity36 , symbolised by the @entity12 logo , is the most rigorous international cruelty - free certification in the world			1
' each company is regularly audited to ensure that no animal testing takes place throughout each company ’s entire supply chain			0
' where companies no longer comply with the @entity36 , the right to use the @entity12 logo is retracted			0
' following discussion with @entity7 , its certification was retracted in mid-december			0
' some companies wish to bring ethical beauty to @entity6 , however this is not currently possible until @entity6 changes its current policy which requires animal testing			1
' i am disappointed that certain companies have fallen prey to the lure of the @entity6 market and are letting animals pay the price			1
consumer pressure can make a difference			0
the @entity12 logo is used by brands that do n't test on animals , useful for ethically - conscious beauty fans emerging market : @entity6 requires that all cosmetics for human use are first tested on animals ( pictured above is a make - up artist at work in @entity70 ) ' we certify over 400 companies around the world that refuse to allow animal testing into their products , so there is plenty of choice for everyone who wishes to eliminate this cruel , unnecessary and outdated practice			1
' the only way that you can avoid animal testing in your toiletries and beauty products is by looking for the @entity12 logo , or checking @entity87			0
' @entity88 banned animal testing in 1998 and several large cosmetics companies including @entity91 , @entity92 's , the co-operative , @entity94 , @entity95 all have @entity12 certification meaning they are cruelty - free			2
hair - care giant @entity91 pulled out of @entity6 after being informed that the company would have to pay for animal tests in order to continue selling its products there			1
@entity91 ceo and co-founder @entity102 put sales in @entity6 on hold last year and confirmed they will not sell products in that country in order to remain committed to the company 's cruelty - free policy			1
mr @entity102 said : ' since @entity91 was founded in 1980 , we have been cruelty - free			0
' we do not conduct or condone animal testing on our products , and we will not attempt to market our products in @entity6 until alternatives to animal testing methods have been accepted by the government			2
' @entity91 always has been and always will be cruelty - free			0
' leading the way : @entity95 is one of several big @entity88 firms that has cruelty - free @entity12 approval for its own products dr @entity124 , campaigns director of internal animal protection organisation @entity125 , said it is down to individual companies to make a stand			0
he continued : ' it 's a fundamental decision companies need to make			0
' it 's much better if they stick to their principles and avoid @entity6 , which will put pressure on the government to change their own policies			2
' it 's unnecessary for @entity6 to require repeat and totally unnecessary testing on these products			2
' @entity141 has also recently decided to cancel its plans to enter the @entity6 market after being informed of the animal testing requirements			2
spokesman for the charity @entity146 ( @entity146 ) foundation , @entity147 , said : ' we are seeing welcome signs of progress in @entity6 but their current animal testing requirements are a major factor pushing up cosmetics tests on animals globally			1
' companies who have turned their backs on their non-animal testing policies because of the lure of @entity6 have regressed a generation : their products are once again being dripped into rabbits ' eyes and smeared onto animals ' abraded skin			1
' while many progressive and principled companies are sticking to their non-animal testing policies , others need more motivation			0
' but the revelation that some large name brands are giving up their cruelty - free status to sell to @entity6 will come as a surprise to many shoppers			1
even more surprisingly , there are many huge international brands including @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 , which have never been able to use the @entity12 logo because of their animal testing policies			0
and while an @entity183 - wide ban on the marketing of animal - tested cosmetics is due to come into force next year , campaigners warn that the @entity187 is now contemplating compromises or even delays to the legislation			1
mr @entity147 continued : ' it 's vital that the @entity183 protect its own ban on the sale of animal - tested cosmetics due in 2013			2
' we 've led the world on this issue – we must n't take any steps backward right here in our own back yard			0
' a spokesman for @entity7 said : ' @entity7 does not and never has tested its products on animals			2
' similarly , we insist that our suppliers certify that none of the ingredients we use are tested on animals			2
' we do sell our products in @entity6 however and the @entity6 government reserves the right to conduct tests , but we are hopeful that this situation will change soon			0
' we are actively working with the @entity35 , with whom we have a long term and constructive relationship , to influence the @entity6 authorities to allow the alternative tests that apply elsewhere in the world			1
' @entity218 , director of @entity9 @entity88 , said : ' we are against animal testing			0
we do not test our ingredients and formulas on animals and never will			0
' leaping bunny approved @entity91 @entity141 @entity92 's @entity95 @entity224 faith in nature the co-operative @entity229 's bees @entity230 @entity231 non-approved companies @entity7 @entity8 @entity9 @entity233 @entity235 @entity234 @entity236 @entity176 @entity238 @entity237 @entity240 @entity239 @entity241 @entity177 @entity242 @entity243			0

by law , all human cosmetics sold in @entity6 must first be tested on animals
*lucrative* @entity6 beauty sales rose by 18 per cent to £ 10bn last year
@entity35 chief executive ' disappointed ' to see brands ' letting animals pay the price ' for their profit - *chasing*
