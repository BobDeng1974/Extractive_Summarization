by @entity0 @entity1 , the @entity2 steward who cleared @entity3 of cheating at the @entity4 , has urged @entity5 to ‘ man up ’ over the decision and move on			1
@entity5 was angry that @entity3 slithered off the track at the @entity10 corner in the dying minutes of qualifying			1
it caused yellow flags to be waved , preventing @entity5 from finishing his final lap and leaving @entity3 in pole position			1
@entity3 went on to win the race , with @entity5 insinuating afterwards that data he saw showed his @entity18 team - mate had acted deliberately			1
not happy : @entity5 ( left ) was unimpressed by the behaviour of his @entity18 team - mate @entity3 ( right ) during qualifying for the @entity4 leading the way : @entity3 ( right ) pulls away from @entity23 ( left ) in @entity24 on sunday but @entity1 , who is president of the @entity25 , @entity27 ’s owners , and a veteran of 146 @entity30 races , said : ‘ i understand that @entity5 was upset			1
possibly he would have gone faster than @entity3 on that lap. arguably the incident cost him the @entity4			1
‘ i do n’t want to give him advice really — he has won umpteen races and a world championship — but if i were to say anything it would be to man up and concentrate on the next race in @entity39			1
’ speaking about the stewards ’ decision for the first time , @entity1 told @entity43 : ‘ you could argue that as president of the @entity25 i would have a reason to come to a decision that would have favoured the @entity2 driver , but obviously that is not how i would approach it			1
i am there to be independent			2
‘ it is a big decision to make when you are deciding to move a driver to the back of the grid			2
it was doubly important to get it right because it could affect many things — probably the outcome of the race and possibly of the world championship			2
‘ we had all @entity18 ’s data , including @entity5 ’s data to overlay on @entity3 ’s			1
we had the @entity65 data			2
we had onboard shots , overhead shots , circuit shots			0
we had throttle traces , braking traces , everything we needed to make , hopefully , the right decision			0
time to move on : @entity5 has been urged to concentrate on this weekend 's @entity39 @entity4 by steward @entity1 no regrets : @entity3 was cleared of any wrongdoing by the @entity65 's team of stewards ‘ it was not black and white			1
it took a long time			0
we wanted to be sure and thorough			0
‘ the driver is a massive component in what we end up deciding			0
so @entity3 was in the stewards ’ room for a long time with the team manager ( @entity85 )			1
i would n’t say i interrogated him ; i interviewed him			0
i made sure i asked him all the right questions			0
‘ i have been around a long time and seen people try to pull the wool over my eyes			0
did i i have doubts in my mind , of course i did			0
but he gave me the answers i needed			0
‘ i know there are conspiracy theories but you will not find a more honest driver in grand prix racing than @entity3			2
he said himself that he made a mistake , came in too fast , braked too late and locked up his rear tyres			0
’ the @entity65 brought in former drivers as stewards — of whom @entity1 is one of the most respected for his sense of fairness — to help the panel make informed decisions			2
there was unanimity among the four stewards in this case			0
not laughing now : @entity5 claimed he is not friends with @entity3 in the aftermath of the @entity4			1

@entity5 was angered when he was prevented from finishing his final lap in qualifying because of yellow flags being waved
@entity3 started in pole position and won the @entity4
@entity1 has advised @entity5 to move on and concentrate on this weekend 's race in @entity39
