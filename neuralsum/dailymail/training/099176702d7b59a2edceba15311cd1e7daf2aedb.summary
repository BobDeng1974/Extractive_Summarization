the author of @entity76 and @entity77 based his novels in the fictional county of @entity80 , which was based heavily on @entity20 and its @entity82			0
one of his poems was set at @entity84 , a stone 's throw from the @entity12			1
understated : @entity87 in the @entity89 town of @entity90 came sixth , beating a coastal home in @entity92 @entity93 , @entity36 , was seventh looking like a @entity35 palace - but reviewers preferred @entity42 @entity96 : the @entity98 architecture of @entity99 , @entity100 , helped get it into eighth place the couple , who have no background in the hotel trade , told the @entity106 their customers came from as far afield as @entity108 and @entity109			1
mrs @entity110 added : ' the reviews rave about @entity72 's breakfast			0
he goes to a great deal of trouble to get the best local produce			0
' this year 's top 10 in the website 's @entity118 ' choice awards was dominated by @entity42 b&bs , with three of them alone in @entity29			1
the sweeping beauty of the @entity89 and forests of @entity98 also feature in a list which includes venues from @entity35 to @entity40			0
for some , the world of @entity42 b&bs once had a reputation for nosy landladies and limp breakfasts			2
but there has been a surge in popularity for stay - at - home tourism amid the recession , with families looking to cut back on their budgets			0
so while the hotel industry was once immortalised in comedies like @entity141 , tv shows such as @entity142 now pitch @entity12 owners against each other to provide the best service			2
in all , @entity3 users put 15 of the top 25 b&bs in the world in @entity42			2
that is despite the others including a villa overlooking the crystal - clear waters of the @entity154 in @entity155 and a @entity157 - style glass - fronted home in @entity158 , @entity92			0
@entity42 venues also beat an @entity161 paradise in @entity162 - and a home in @entity51 with its own outdoor swimming pool			0
floral : in ninth place was the @entity167 in @entity168 , @entity29 , amid a surge in stay - at - home tourism from the windswept west coast of @entity42 to the sun - baked west coast the @entity175 , rounding off the top 10 was the @entity176 in @entity177 , @entity178			1
@entity42 claimed 15 of the top 25 spots on @entity3			2
