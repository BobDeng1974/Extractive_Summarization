by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 02:38 est , 13 june 2013 updated : 05:49 est , 13 june 2013 steel : home secretary @entity3 , pictured leaving @entity4 this week , urged the @entity6 party not to buckle @entity3 has cast herself as the @entity7 ’ new @entity8 , telling colleagues pushing through unpopular spending cuts and reforms : ‘ whatever you do , do n’t buckle			1
’ in another speech ranging far beyond her @entity17 brief , the most senior woman in the government insisted it was possible to do ‘ more for less ’ across the public sector – highlighting welfare , defence and local government			1
mrs may also suggested the government had to do more to stand up to vested interests in the private sector – particularly banks and big utilities			0
‘ @entity32 , unaccountable businesses that manipulate markets or abuse their monopoly positions should also be in our sights			2
' whether it ’s the banking sector , where customers find it difficult to switch companies , or the big utility firms , with their opaque pricing plans , or the oil industry , which stands accused of price fixing by whistleblowers , we should be as tough with the private sector as we are with the public sector , ’ the home secretary said			1
in a speech to the centre - right think tank reform , mrs may , who has been careful not to stray from her brief since speculation about her leadership ambitions erupted earlier this year , sketched out a broad platform for a @entity6 victory in 2015			2
the steely home secretary , hailed as ‘ @entity58 ’s @entity57 ’ by her allies , said the @entity6 ’ mission went far beyond the elimination of the vast budget deficit left behind by @entity63			1
she pointed out that her party had questioned the level of @entity63 ’s public spending as long ago as the 2001 election campaign but ‘ sadly our argument fell on deaf ears , and we all know what came next ’			1
a senior @entity6 minister today fuelled speculation that @entity3 is positioning herself as a future party leader			0
in the @entity63 mp @entity74 ( @entity75 ) said mrs may could benefit from persuading police forces to buy more @entity58 vehicles , as he urged @entity24 departments to back the country 's car industry			1
mr @entity74 : ' will you talk to the home secretary and get her to back @entity58 industry ? it might even help her leadership ambitions			1
' mr @entity86 prompted cheers from the @entity63 as he replied : ' they may not need that much help			0
' ‘ high taxes , a structural deficit , unreformed public services and an unbalanced economy meant that when the crash came , @entity58 was n’t ready , ’ she added			1
mrs may said there was ‘ no other way ’ than fundamental reform of the public sector and pointed to her own success in reducing crime , while slashing budgets			1
‘ when we said we would cut central government police budgets by twenty per cent in real terms over four years , the critics – not just the @entity103 , but @entity108 , the @entity109 and many academics – were united			2
frontline policing would be decimated and crime would go up			0
' but in fact , the opposite happened – crime is down by more than ten per cent since the election , ’ she said			0
‘ that crime is down is thanks to the efforts of thousands of officers up and down the country and the leadership of chief constables , but it ’s also down to police reform			1
mrs may pointed to measures to make police more accountable via beat meetings , crime maps and elected commissioners , and the abolition of national targets and the introduction of greater flexibility in police employment			0
‘ we ’re delivering more with less , ’ she insisted			2
the home secretary said the @entity7 had to ‘ make sure that the debate in this country never returns to the false choice of more spending or worse services ’			1
she went on : ' we have to reassure people about our motives and our values			0
we have to show them that we ’re committed to universal public services and we must never appear to be doctrinaire about what we ’re doing			0
' we have to be clear that we ’re reducing spending on public services not because we care little for them , but because we have to for the sake of our economy			0
' @entity154 : mrs may set out what @entity155 needed to do to win back support and reassure voters he holds conservative values urging @entity161 colleagues not to waver in the teeth of opposition to reforms , she said : ‘ difficult decisions often mean upsetting people – especially when the change involves pay and conditions			1
but that does n’t mean you can shirk them			0
‘ you have to decide what is in the national interest and do it			0
keep making your case , always remind people of what you ’re trying to achieve , what ’s the end objective , but whatever you do , do n’t buckle			0
’ mrs may would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to @entity155 , and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him			2
however , she is understood to regard @entity181 as ‘ faintly ridiculous ’ and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the @entity7 losing the next election .			2

home secretary ranges far beyond her brief with rallying *cry* to @entity161
insists it is possible to do ' more with less ' but not cutting out of *ideology*
hailed as ‘ @entity58 ’s @entity57 ’ by allies who *predict* leadership *bid*
