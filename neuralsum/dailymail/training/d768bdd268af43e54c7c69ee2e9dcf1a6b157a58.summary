pictured with his first bike in 1954 , @entity0 spent six months in the 60s hitch - hiking from @entity3 to @entity4 at only 16 at 16 years of age , with less than two pence to his name and only his best mate beside him , @entity0 set out to hitch - hike 2000km from @entity3 to @entity4 in @entity9			1
over the next six months the two teenagers , who sought a promised fortune , came face - to - face with the kooky characters and unique landscapes that made - up @entity16 's outback in the 1960s			1
more than 50 years later , mr @entity0 ' memories and diary entries from the time have been published into the book once a @entity22 ; a memoir of sorts which celebrates and looks ' back at a time and a way of life that no longer exists '			1
' it was the characters who got me writing the book , ' mr @entity0 told @entity33 , ' the characters are worth remembering			1
' from stealing food , crashing cars , picking fruit , camping by the roadside , hitch - hiking with truck drivers and farm widows , being thrown into jail and being taken in and fed by families who were ' flabbergasted to see two boys travelling on their own ' - the book records a range of mischief in which the two boys partook			1
mr @entity0 explained how in an era of unlocked front doors , he and his childhood friend @entity50 learnt to survive on the road while stealthily taking showers in random pubs in the early hours of the morning			1
the teenager ( pictured here in 1959 at @entity58 , bottom row , very centre ) went on the adventure alongside with only two pence to his name and only his best mate @entity50 by his side ' we would just go up the resident stairs and walk along the corridor to have a shower – and you 'd wash your clothes while you 're doing it , ' mr @entity0 said			1
' we got caught up in @entity71 though , which was a bit traumatic			0
this bloke came out of a room down near the stairs at the bottom of the hall – the toilets were always at the far end of the hall , you see – wearing a pair of underpants and a blue singlet , just your typical country @entity16			2
' he called out " what room are you two in ? " and i just quickly answered " 14 "			0
' his arm instantly shot out towards the back of my neck and smashed me into the wall when i said that			0
" 14 my arse ! " of course , there were only nine rooms in the hotel			0
more than 50 years later , mr @entity0 ( pictured with his elder sister @entity97 ) has published his memories from the trip in the book once a @entity22 with his father and sister at @entity103 in 1953 : the book details all the mischief the two boys got up to including stealing food , crashing cars , camping by the roadside , and being thrown into jail ' we had to paint the roof of the hotel for that and of course there was drama to follow with that because @entity50 was afraid of heights			1
' however , the book serves as a record of more sombre times in @entity16 too ; an era when the country still directed hate and prejudice towards both immigrants and @entity128 people			1
' @entity16 still had a white @entity16 policy then – racially vilifying and and insulting foreigners was common			1
whether you were @entity133 or @entity134 or a @entity135 , it did n't matter , we were all insulted			0
the book is also a reflection of that , not in a bitter or resentful way , that 's just how it was , ' mr @entity0 said			2
it recalls a particularly appalling example of this attitude directed towards an @entity128 man which was witnessed by @entity0 and @entity50 just outside @entity146 in @entity9 as they tried to light a fire by the side of the road			2
mr @entity0 with his sister @entity97 and father and myself in 1949 ( left ) and dressed as a ' bush musician ' for the school fete in 1955 ( right ) ' we were just sitting on side of road when suddenly a police car came and stopped about 200 yards away from us and a cop got out and dragged out an @entity128 man who was just paralytic drunk , ' mr @entity0 recalled			2
@entity163 recruit training in @entity165 , @entity166 , in 1962 at age 18 : mr @entity0 fought in the @entity168 and developed post-traumatic stress disorder ' he pushed him out the side of car and punched him in his stomach and we heard him yell " and stay out , " presumably as he was kicking him out of town			1
then he looked around and kicked the @entity175 in the groin and just drove off			0
' we had been hiding , but when we got up to see how the @entity128 man was , the cop had seen us and he drove back and gave us a grilling			2
we were vagrants so he was saying things like " i can arrest you at any time " , " i 'll arrest you for resisting arrest " and " if anyone hears about this , i 'll know who told them "			0
' @entity0 adventures came to an abrupt end when his mother arrived from @entity190 after speaking to his sister , who he contacted regularly			2
determined to make something of her son , ' she took me by the ear lobe and dragged me to the recruiting office and i joined the army , ' mr @entity0 said			2
from that moment onward , life took on a different tone for mr @entity0 , who fought in the @entity168 and developed a debilitating version of post-traumatic stress disorder that would haunt him for the next 40 years			1
he spent 10 and a half months on the ground with only four days break , in what he describes as necessary ' rifle gripping tension '			0
' even at the base camp which was portrayed as ' easy with steaks and beer ' , every time we went outside the wire someone came back minus a foot or dead			0
182 people were wounded and 25 men were lost , that 's almost one every one and a half days so that keeps you alert and tense , ' he said			0
' it does things to you and you need to have this tension to keep you watchful and alert and alive			0
once you 've got into that mode it 's not an easy function to turn off			0
' due to understanding the struggles associated with returning from war , mr @entity0 is donating a portion of the sales from once a @entity22 to war veteran associations			1
reminiscing of simpler times , he admitted that he had attempted to retrace his steps 14 years after his journey in 1975 alongside his wife @entity231			0
however , none of the characters that made the adventure such an enduring memory were still there .			0

@entity0 spent six months hitch - hiking from @entity3 to @entity4 alongside his best friend when he was 16 - years - old
his book , once a @entity22 , reveals the kooky characters and unique landscapes that they encountered in the 1960s adventure
it also serves as a reminder of the racism experienced by immigrants and @entity128 people during the era of the white @entity16 policy
mr @entity0 , who suffers from @entity255 after fighting in the @entity168 at 18 , is donating some of the proceeds from the book to war veteran associations
