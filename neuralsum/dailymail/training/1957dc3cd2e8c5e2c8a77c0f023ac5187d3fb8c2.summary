sir @entity0 insisted @entity2 's enthusiasm for leaving the @entity3 is not shared by the majority of people @entity2 's enthusiasm for leaving the @entity3 is not shared by the majority of the @entity8 population , sir @entity0 has claimed			1
the former @entity10 prime minister insisted each generation of @entity8 is ' more @entity12 ' than the last , and warned if the @entity8 severs ties with @entity14 it will ' lose some of its influence and power '			1
it came as @entity19 @entity18 warned the @entity10 referendum on @entity8 's membership of the @entity3 was ' dangerous ' and ' utterly unrealistic '			1
@entity22 has promised that if he is prime minister after the election he will renegotiate @entity8 's membership of the @entity3 before holding an in - out referendum by 2017			1
he has made clear that he thinks his plan will succeed , and he will then recommend staying in the @entity3			2
if he fails he admits he will ' rule nothing out ' , raising the prospect that he will recommend exit from the 28 - nation bloc			0
sir @entity0 , who has been tipped to play a key role in the negotiations , insisted @entity33 ' fades with each generation ' and predicts @entity8 will vote to stay in the @entity3			1
he told the @entity12 magazine , he said : ' a @entity8 outside of the @entity3 will lose some of its influence and power			1
' that case must be used to recapture the hearts and minds of the @entity8 people			1
and it is a much more attractive case than the negativism of @entity45 sentiment			0
so i 'm not worried			0
' there has always been a minority of the population who emotionally regard themselves as being @entity8 but not @entity12			2
but this feeling fades with each generation			2
' each successive generation regards itself as more @entity12 than its predecessor			0
whereas my generation put on its knapsack and went to @entity59 for the weekend , the modern generation puts on its knapsack and goes around the world			0
' he also dismissed @entity2 for failing to resonate with voters			0
' make no mistake : @entity2 does not represent the majority of the @entity8 population			1
' present the people with the broader arguments and they will be persuaded that staying within the @entity3 is in our best interest			2
' but we have to have some indication that @entity8 and @entity12 can find agreement on difficult issues and that 's what the renegotiations are going to be all about			0
' @entity22 has promised an in - out referendum if he is still prime minister in 2017 , but @entity18 warned he will achieve little and risk investment in the @entity8 mr @entity22 has insisted that the promise of a referendum will be a red line in any future coalition negotiation			1
his demands on welfare reform include banning @entity3 nationals from claiming in - work benefits or social housing in @entity8 for four years , deporting jobless migrants if they do not get work for six months and refusing to allow other countries to join the @entity3 without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached @entity8 levels			1
he also wants tougher rules on deporting foreign criminals and the right to refuse to allow other countries to join the @entity3 without imposing controls on the movement of their workers until their economies have reached @entity8 levels			1
the @entity19 have refused to back the idea of a vote , insisting the @entity104 have set an artificial timetable			0
in a speech in @entity14 today , mr @entity18 warned the @entity10 approach is ' actually quite dangerous '			0
he said : ' it is assuming that the other 27 countries will magically agree to @entity8 requests			2
it is raising expectations that changes can be achieved within the @entity3 that will be very difficult to deliver			0
' we do not think that a referendum is sensible or helpful in anyway			0
precipitating a referendum in current conditions , holding out the prospect of major reforms that are n't going to be achieved is dangerous			0

sir @entity0 insists most people do not agree with *anti-eu* views of @entity2
warns leaving the @entity3 will mean @entity8 will ' lose some of its influence '
*ex-prime* minister says @entity33 ' fades with each generation '
