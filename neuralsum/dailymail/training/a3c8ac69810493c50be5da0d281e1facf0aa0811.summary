by @entity0 published : 11:51 est , 10 january 2013 updated : 13:57 est , 10 january 2013 he had never seen a moose before and would have liked his first encounter to have been at quite some distance			0
but unfortunately for @entity6 , nature can be notoriously unpredictable at times			1
the 19 - year - old was just preparing for another ski run on the slopes of @entity11 's @entity10 when he turned to see a half - tonne bull moose charging right at him			1
the moose would easily have caught him , but luckily veered off up the slope when he was just a few feet away as his target made a beeline for the woods			0
' i was like " you got to be kidding me , this thing is coming right for me " , ' mr @entity6 told @entity35 after the incident , which was caught on video just before @entity38			1
' i looked over my shoulder and it was closing in on me very fast			0
my life flashed before my eyes			1
' catching up : the moose closes the gap with worrying speed as mr @entity6 sprints for the treeline fearing for his life : mr @entity6 said the beast was moving in ' very fast ' as he looked over his shoulder phew ! the moose would easily have caught him , but luckily veered off up the slope at the last minute it 's not unusual to have moose in ski areas and this particular one has been seen by hundreds of times around the resort over last fortnight			1
but mr @entity6 is first person to have such a hairy encounter with it , especially as it was his first time ever seeing the species			1
he said : ' it 's not the ideal way to see the moose the first time			0
i 'd rather see it at a distance rather than it charging at me			0
' ' i 'd rather see it at a distance ' : mr @entity6 said he would have preferred for his first encounter with a moose to have been rather less dangerous common sight : it 's not unusual to have moose in ski areas and this particular one has been seen by hundreds of times around the resort over last fortnight experts do not believe the moose was ill , but had probably discovered an easier way to move around the resort because of the flattened snow			2
they think it was very likely an isolated incident			0
that will be of some comfort to mr @entity6 who no doubt hopes his next trip on the pistes will be somewhat less eventful			2
video : watch @entity6 chased by moose			2

@entity6 , 19 , said ' life flashed before my eyes ' as half - tonne beast honed in
