fly - half @entity0 earned a 21 - 21 draw for @entity3 with the last kick of a dour @entity6 match at @entity7			1
the 22 - year - old @entity8 kept his cool to slot his seventh penalty on an afternoon when former @entity13 fly - half @entity11 kicked seven for @entity14			1
the two points put @entity14 in joint second place with @entity17 and @entity18 , while @entity3 go level on points with @entity21 and @entity22			0
fly - half @entity0 kicked all of @entity3 's points as the @entity3 battled to a 21 - 21 draw at @entity7 saracens centre @entity26 was the only player to get a yellow card on a rain - soaked afternoon when , with so much at stake , neither side were prepared to take any risks and instead relied on the boots of @entity0 and @entity11			1
@entity14 led 12 - 6 after a hard fought first half thanks to @entity11 , who kicked four penalties from five attempts			2
his opposite number , @entity0 , did not fare so well , slotting two from four and would have kicked himself for missing one from bang in front of the posts			0
@entity11 was equally impressive with the boot ; the veteran fly - half kicking seven penalties also both sides were missing key players on international duty but @entity3 recalled @entity13 prop @entity47 for his first start since neck surgery and were led by former @entity51 @entity50 , their oldest captain at 39 years and 285 days for 90 years			1
with so much at stake neither side took any risks and , as a result , not a single chance was created			0
the biggest talking point of the half was the yellow card shown to @entity26 , who , along with @entity60 , picked up @entity3 winger @entity61 and dumped him on his back			2
after consulting the @entity65 and watching several replays , referee @entity64 sin binned @entity67 but could easily have shown a yellow to @entity60 too			0
@entity3 scrum - half @entity71 cops a heavy tackle from his opposite number @entity74 @entity3 failed to take advantage and the score was 3 - 3 during the 10 minutes @entity26 was off the field			1
@entity11 kicked penalties in the 10th , 20th , 32nd and 34th minutes , while @entity0 replied in the 23rd and 29th minutes			0
it was more of the same after the interval , with @entity0 and @entity11 swapping punches and @entity14 keeping their nose ahead			2
all @entity84 veteran and @entity3 lock @entity50 grabs a quick drink during his side 's clash @entity0 slotted three penalties in the third quarter , the first a monster from 50 metres , but @entity11 hit back with two of his own and constantly pegged @entity3 back with diagonal kicks to touch as the rain poured down			1
the second of those , in the 57th minute , came after @entity14 had a chance to pull clear after winning a penalty at a scrum near @entity3 's line			0
they could have gone for the try , either through another scrum or a line out and drive but chose the safe option of @entity11 's boot			0
and minutes later @entity3 were back on level terms after @entity0 kicked his fifth and sixth penalties			2
@entity11 put @entity14 ahead yet again with five minutes left with a simple penalty but @entity0 equalised right on full time with his seventh after @entity14 had been penalised at a scrum , awarded after @entity60 's kick had gone dead			0
@entity26 makes a half break through the @entity3 defence but the @entity115 's sin - binning proved costly			1

@entity3 fly half @entity0 landed seven penalties with @entity14 number 10 @entity11 added seven kicks of his own
saracens centre @entity26 sin - binned during tight encounter
both sides were missing key players on international duty but @entity3 *welcomed* @entity13 tight head @entity47 back to their *starling* line - up
