an @entity1 farmer has decided not to sell his prized bull it fetched a world record price of £ 1.23million because he already earns more than £ 30,000 a month selling its highly - sought after semen			1
if @entity7 had gone ahead with the sale , it would have made his three - year - old bull , called @entity10 , the most expensive in the world			1
but after selling off the bull 's brother , @entity12 , for the equivalent of £ 860,000 , mr @entity7 is not in a rush to get rid of the 1,200kg bull			1
farmer @entity7 is keeping hold of his prized bull @entity10 , pictured together , despite the animal fetching a world record price of £ 1.23million at auction the @entity23 breed bull would provide plenty of meat , but his real value comes from the 4 to 5ml of high quality semen he produces every day , which is in demand across the country			1
mr @entity7 , who lives in @entity32 village located in the @entity34 region of @entity36 's @entity35 , said : ' i do n't see the need to rush into selling him given that i can earn over £ 30,000 a month from selling his semen			2
' he also makes a similar amount from the bull that fathered @entity10			0
he added that @entity10 was ' like a son to him ' - and a very profitable one			0
the @entity23 breed bull produces 4 to 5ml of semen a day , which earns mr @entity7 £ 30,000 a month the bull consumes around £ 20 worth of food every day , but it 's a worthwhile investment as its breed is known for selling for high prices one of the reasons that semen from the family is so expensive is due to the fact that the mother of @entity10 and @entity55 , produces up to 26litres of milk every day - a record - breaking amount for a @entity23 buffalo			1
but while mr @entity7 regularly brings in a small fortune from the bull , it consumes around £ 20 worth of food every day			2
this is a considerable amount considering the monthly wage for many people in rural communities across the country is around £ 100			0
the auction took place at a three - day fair organised in @entity71 by the @entity72			0
the @entity23 breed of water buffalo ( @entity74 ) is a type of domestic water buffalo kept for dairy production			2

the bulls are used for improving the milk productivity of dairy buffaloes , usually through artificial insemination			0
