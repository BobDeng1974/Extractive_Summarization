@entity0 is letting it be known how she feels about childhood vaccines			1
the recent grandmother and near certain @entity5 presidential candidate did not mince words , keeping her statement brief and to the point by releasing it on @entity10			1
' the science is clear : the earth is round , the sky is blue , and # vaccineswork			2
let 's protect all our kids			0
# @entity18 , ' wrote the former secretary of state			0
this just hours after two other politicians who have been exploring the idea of a presidential run , republicans @entity20 and @entity22 , came under fire for stating they did not believe in mandatory child vaccinations			1
' he did however make it clear that he and his wife had all of their children vaccinated			2
now , many are attacking @entity20 for being ' anti-science , ' while members of his own party are wondering if this muted response is a sign that the oft polarizing politician - who is nothing if not direct when answering questions - is toning things down as he sets his sights on a job in the @entity74			2
the backlash was so immediate that @entity20 's camp released a clarification on his statement within just hours			1
' to be clear : the governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated , ' said spokesman @entity88 according to @entity89			1
' at the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination , which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate			0
' @entity20 ( left ) and @entity22 ( right ) both said on monday that families should have a choice when it comes to vaccines , a statement @entity20 quickly backtracked on @entity20 's office stressed that the @entity104 governor and his wife @entity105 ( above with @entity107 's chancellor of the exchequer @entity106 on tuesday ) have vaccinated all their children in stark contrast to @entity39 's firm support of vaccinations , and even @entity20 's middle - of - the - road beliefs , is senator @entity22 , a former medical doctor who believes that vaccines should be ' voluntary			1
' ' while i think it is a good idea to take the vaccine , i think that is a personal decision for individuals , ' he said in an interview with conservative talk radio host @entity121			0
he then took it a step further during an interview with @entity127 host @entity126 , telling her ; ' i have heard of many tragic cases of walking , talking normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines			2
' he capped it all off by saying ; ' you know , for most of our history they have been voluntary			0
so i do n't think i 'm arguing for anything out of the ordinary			0
... i 'm not arguing vaccines are a bad idea			0
i think they are a good thing , but i think the parent should have some input			0
' and while it is true that the decision whether or not take vaccines , which were first created by @entity150 in the late nineteenth century , has long been voluntary , @entity22 seems to omit that since their introduction people are living longer , mortality rates have decreased drastically , and overall quality of life has , almost universally , improved drastically for people around the globe as a direct result of vaccinations			1
what 's more , vaccines have managed to eliminate over a dozen infectious diseases in some areas of the world , and in the case of polio , actually eradicate a disease that led to paralysis in millions of @entity168			1
this is why , politics aside , it seems that those most upset with @entity20 and @entity22 are parents , with many labeling their comments as irresponsible when delivered at a time when over 100 cases of measles have been reported in 14 states around the country			1
all of these cases seem to link back to an outbreak that started last december in @entity181 , with officials now believing an @entity168 child who had not been vaccinated carried it home from a foreign country			1
and while measles is an often painful and uncomfortable viral disease , especially for young child , with high fevers and a red rash covering the body , it is seldom , if ever , fatal			1
that being said , many are concerned as measles is one of the infectious diseases that had been eliminated from this country since 2000 , this entirely thanks to a vaccine first being introduced in 1963 , which would in 1971 become the @entity201 vaccine , protecting children from the mumps and rubella as well			1
then , in 1989 , a two - part process went into practice during which a child is immunized once as a toddler and again around the age of four or five			0
this method has proven to be 99 % effective and has resulted in a 75 % decrease in measles fatalities in the @entity168			2
@entity215 upstarts and moms @entity217 ( left ) and @entity218 ( right ) are the two best known members of the anti-vaccination movement anti-vaccine supporters have a far different opinion of the measles vaccine , believing that it causes autism in children			0
this despite the fact that the research paper from which these opinions are derived , which linked autism spectrum disorders to the @entity201 vaccine was revealed to be ' utterly false ' by the editor - in - chief of @entity233 , the medical journal in which it was published			0
@entity217 , who , alongside @entity215 reality star turned designer @entity237 , is the best known member of the group , became a supporter after her son @entity240 was diagnosed with autism			0
meanwhile , president @entity245 , himself a father to two young daughter , showed his support for child vaccinations over the weekend , telling @entity248 ; ' there is every reason to get vaccinated — there are n’t reasons to not			2
' he closed out be saying ; ' you should get your kids vaccinated			0
it 's good for them , but we should be able to get back to the point where measles effectively is not existing in this country			2

@entity0 voiced her firm support for childhood vaccines on monday
the potential @entity5 presidential candidate wrote that ' the science is clear ' when it comes to vaccines , adding ' @entity270 '
earlier in the day potential @entity273 candidates @entity20 and @entity22 came under fire for speaking out against mandatory vaccines
@entity20 's team issued a statement almost immediately after he made the comments , saying how ' important ' vaccines are to the @entity168
this as there have now been over 100 cases of measles in just the past two months , which had been eliminated from the @entity168 since 2000
officials believe this *current* outbreak started when an @entity168 child who had not been vaccinated caught the viral infection while traveling *overseas*
