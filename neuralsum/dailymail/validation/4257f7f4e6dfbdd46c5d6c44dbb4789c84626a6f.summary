nervous postmen are refusing to deliver to a block of flats unless they are escorted by a band of female pensioners			1
@entity5 will only bring post to the 100 flats on three days a week – instead of the usual six – and even then , will only deliver through letterboxes if a 69 - year - old female councillor is stood at the postman ’s side			1
his van downstairs , meanwhile , is watched by two ageing female residents of the block in case its tyres are slashed			1
a postman begins his round near @entity20 while elderly residents stand and guard his delivery van councillor @entity23 , 69 , escorts the postman around the building after @entity5 refused to make deliveries at the block of flats the bizarre arrangement began six months ago after a 34 - year - old woman living in the flats was accused of assaulting a postman , as well as sending threatening emails to @entity5			1
ironically , the building – @entity35 flats near @entity20 in central @entity36 – has the same name as the man who invented the penny black stamp and effectively created the modern postal service			1
@entity5 initially refused to deliver there at all , forcing residents to take a bus to the nearest sorting office			1
@entity23 , a local @entity45 councillor , complained – and eventually offered to act as a guard three days a week along with volunteers from the flats			1
now every monday , wednesday and friday a band of pensioners waits outside to ‘ police ’ the deliveries			0
@entity53 has complained to regulator @entity54 in the hope of forcing @entity5 to reinstate a proper service			2
mrs @entity23 said : ‘ we are hoping that it will be back to normal , but they are saying that it is unsafe without me or my fellows there to assist			0
’ the arrangement of being chaperoned began when a 34 - year - old woman living in the flats was accused of assaulting a postman , as well as sending threatening emails to @entity5 her husband @entity68 , a former advertising boss who is also 69 , sometimes helps with the escort			1
he said residents are angry about the reduced service , adding : ‘ i spoke to a guy waiting for a hip operation who could miss it as a result of not getting his post immediately			0
’ the woman at the centre of the row , council tenant @entity79 , alleged that it was the postman who attacked her in a lift rather than the other way round			0
police took no further action due to a lack of evidence			0
but a source claimed the ‘ assault ’ involved nothing more than @entity93 pushing the postman and the postman pushing her back			0
@entity53 said it was ‘ working with ’ its tenant , who had apologised and signed an ‘ acceptable behaviour contract ’			0
@entity101 , the local delivery office manager , wrote in a recent letter to residents : ‘ @entity5 are unable to recommence a full mail delivery service			2
@entity53 say they are working with the tenant to allow deliveries to begin again ‘ in november 2012 a resident sent a series of complaints to the @entity5 which became increasingly abusive and threatening ... in june 2014 the resident assaulted our delivery officer in the lifts			2
in december the tyres on our vehicle were slashed ... whilst this may be coincidental i am sure you will understand our concerns			2
’ a spokesman for the @entity123 confirmed it had investigated assault claims but that no one was charged			0
miss @entity79 was unavailable for comment .			0
