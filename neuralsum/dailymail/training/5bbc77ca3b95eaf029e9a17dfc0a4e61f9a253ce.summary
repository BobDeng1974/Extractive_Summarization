by @entity0 scientists have reconstructed one of the biggest asteroid impacts ever to hit @entity4 - and say it was six times as big as the blast than wiped out the dinosaurs			1
the 36 mile wide asteroid is believed to have hit @entity4 3.26 billion years ago , creating unique geological features found in a @entity12 region known as the @entity14 greenstone belt			1
researcher say the impact would have boiled oceans , burned the sky , and cause the planet to shake for 30 minutes			1
the massive asteroid was almost as wide as @entity21 and about three to five times larger than the rock thought to have wiped out the dinosaurs			2
the huge impactor – between 37 and 58 kilometers ( 23 to 36 miles ) wide – collided with the planet at 20 kilometers per second ( 12 miles per second )			1
the jolt , bigger than a 10.8 magnitude earthquake , propelled seismic waves hundreds of kilometers through the @entity4 , breaking rocks and setting off other large earthquakes			2
tsunamis thousands of meters deep – far bigger than recent tsunamis generated by earthquakes — swept across the oceans that covered most of the @entity4 at that time			2
the collision punched a crater into the planet ’s crust that ’s nearly 500 kilometers ( about 300 miles ) across : greater than the distance from @entity38 to @entity39 , and up to two and a half times larger in diameter than the hole formed by the dinosaur - killing asteroid			1
seismic waves bigger than any recorded earthquakes shake the planet for about half an hour at any one location – about six times longer than the huge earthquake that struck @entity49 three years ago			1
the impact also sets off tsunamis many times deeper than the one that followed the @entity49 quake			0
although scientists had previously hypothesized enormous ancient impacts , much greater than the one that may have eliminated the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , now a new study reveals the power and scale of a cataclysmic event some 3.26 billion years ago which is thought to have created geological features found in a @entity12 region known as the @entity14 greenstone belt			1
the research has been accepted for publication in @entity69 , a journal of the @entity71			0

the sky would have become red hot , the atmosphere would have been filled with dust and the tops of oceans would have boiled , the researchers said			1
the impact sent vaporized rock into the atmosphere , which encircled the globe and condensed into liquid droplets before solidifying and falling to the surface , according to the researchers			0

' we knew it was big , but we did n’t know how big , ' @entity107 , a geologist at @entity108 and a co-author of the study , said of the asteroid			0
@entity107 , who discovered telltale rock formations in the @entity14 greenstone a decade ago , thought their structure smacked of an asteroid impact			2
the new research models for the first time how big the asteroid was and the effect it had on the planet , including the possible initiation of a more modern plate tectonic system that is seen in the region , according to @entity107			0
the study marks the first time scientists have mapped in this way an impact that occurred more than 3 billion years ago , @entity107 added , and is likely one of the first times anyone has modeled any impact that occurred during this period of the @entity4 ’s evolution			1
the impact would have been catastrophic to the surface environment			0
the smaller , dino - killing asteroid crash is estimated to have released more than a billion times more energy than the bombs that destroyed @entity139 and @entity140			0
the more ancient hit now coming to light would have released much more energy , experts said			0
although scientists had previously hypothesized enormous ancient impacts , much greater than the one that may have eliminated the dinosaurs 65 million years ago , researchers have now modelled the power and scale of the cataclysmic event for the first time the crator covers an areas 500km wide the impact may have been one of dozens of huge asteroids that scientists think hit the @entity4 during the tail end of the @entity162 period , a major period of impacts that occurred early in the @entity4 ’s history – around 3 billion to 4 billion years ago			1
the study ’s co-authors think the asteroid hit the @entity4 thousands of kilometers away from the @entity170 , although they ca n’t pinpoint the exact location			1
' we ca n’t go to the impact sites			0
in order to better understand how big it was and its effect we need studies like this , ' said @entity107			0
the study ’s findings have important implications for understanding the early @entity4 and how the planet formed			1
the impact may have disrupted the @entity4 ’s crust and the tectonic regime that characterized the early planet , leading to the start of a more modern plate tectonic system , according to the paper ’s co-authors			1
the pummeling the planet endured was ' much larger than any ordinary earthquake , ' said @entity192 , a physicist at @entity108 and co-author of the study			0
he used physics , models , and knowledge about the formations in the @entity14 greenstone belt , other earthquakes and other asteroid impact sites on the @entity4 and the moon to calculate the strength and duration of the shaking that the asteroid produced			2
using this information , @entity206 recreated how waves traveled from the impact site to the @entity14 greenstone belt and caused the geological formations			0
the geological evidence found in the @entity14 that the paper investigates indicates that the asteroid was “ far larger than anything in the last billion years , ' said @entity211 , a professor at @entity212 in @entity213 , @entity214 , who was not involved in the research			1
the @entity14 greenstone belt is an area 100 kilometers ( 62 miles ) long and 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) wide that sits east of @entity224 near the border with @entity226			0
it contains some of the oldest rocks on the planet			0
the model provides evidence for the rock formations and crustal fractures that scientists have discovered in the @entity14 greenstone belt , said @entity235 , a geologist at @entity236 who was not involved in the study			0
' this is providing significant support for the idea that the impact may have been responsible for this major shift in tectonics , ' he said .			0
