the @entity1 family are living in the wrong era			1
from their retro wardrobes to every single room and appliance in their house - they eat , breathe and live the 1950s lifestyle - today			1
the @entity10 ’ home is decked out with vintage appliances that colour coordinate with the 50s wallpaper			2
and then there 's the outfits and hair do 's			1
it 's a style that @entity18 , from @entity19 , has been embracing for more than 30 years			1
‘ i dress like this every day and have done so since the age of 15 , ’ mrs @entity18 told @entity22			1
‘ my whole family wears 1950s clothing too and they love it , ’ she said			1
her son @entity29 , 11 , would generally wear a pair of jeans , a bisley shirt and converse kicks when he goes out			0
‘ the bisley shirts were very popular in the 1950s and it ’s getting a little harder to find but i ’ve got quite a collection			1
her husband @entity28 , 37 , wears the same and sports an @entity51 - like hairstyle complete with sideburns			1
he ’s also the lead singer of a rockabilly band called @entity54			0
' he ’ll wear a bisley shirt or a 1950s suit when he performs or something more rockabilly oriented like the country western style shirts			2
‘ my daughter , @entity27 , 22 , wears vintage occasionally but she really likes the reproduction clothes			0
she looks fantastic in a 1950s wiggle skirt – so that ’s a high - waisted skirt or a pencil skirt that is well fitted and three - quarter length and she ’ll wear a pretty blouse with it			1
‘ and i prefer the beautiful big skirts so the floral full skirts or even the double or triple skirts			0
and lots of petticoats , stockings and a good old fashioned bullet bra because it gives you that perfect shape ! and i have a fetish for fascinators and hats			0
' @entity18 's husband , @entity28 ( left ) is the lead singer of a rockabilly band called ' @entity83 ' so he 's always dressed in a bisley shirt or 1950 's suit like father , like son : the family 's youngest member , @entity29 ( left ) dresses like his dad - sporting a pair of trousers and a bisley shirt the 46 - year - old was six years old when her obsession with the decade began after her parents took her to see @entity51 perform live in @entity98			1
‘ i was very young but i was brought up on @entity51 music , ’ she said			0
‘ when i saw this man live , it was literally like seeing @entity102 himself because he had such an angelic voice , and to see the person that angelic voice belonged to was quite overwhelming			2
' the family kitchen comes complete with utensils , a lemon coloured @entity110 , a @entity112 fridge and even an early @entity114 gas oven – all in working condition			2
they also own a huge @entity117 in the lounge room , as well as a rotary - dial telephone in the hallway			2
‘ the furniture in those days was such good quality and in fact , most of my life purchases that are 60 years old are still in good condition			1
‘ things back then were made to last – whereas these days , we are a disposable generation where things only last for a year or so and then you have to throw them out			0
‘ we ’ve also got a 1950s beauty parlour and a magnificent cocktail bar – these are all sentimental items to me and i can tell you when and where i got each and every piece from – they 've become part of my family			1
' inside mrs @entity18 's beauty parlour , her beauty products are true to the era , with authentic 50 's roller set , hair dryers and make - up each and every item has been colour coordinated with the wallpaper in every room of the family home the mother of two also keeps herself busy with her own 50s inspired business - @entity153 - where she teaches deportment classes , as well as hair and make - up workshops after she taught herself the authentic styles			1
‘ i teach ladies how to present themselves , how to hold themselves correctly and how to sit properly , ' she said			0
‘ i just think that people had a lot more respect for other human beings back then and had good old fashion values – where people would walk down the street and greet each other and gentlemen were gentlemen – they opened the car door and pulled back the chair			0
‘ and that to me that is really important and is something i ’m still teaching my children			0
’ the @entity1 home comes complete with a @entity117 , a rotary - dial telephone and traditional family board games the mother of two keeps herself busy with her own 50s inspired business - @entity153 - where she teaches hair and make - up workshops mrs @entity18 also runs her own vintage photo studio where she gives her clients a 50s makeover from head to toe			1
her clients range from women of all ages to men or 14 - year - old 's parties			2
‘ it ’s an experience stepping back in time and the thing is , most woman who come along and are photographed by me lack a lot of self - confidence because they 've never done anything special in their life , ’ she said			2
‘ so what i do is i transform them with their hair and make - up so that they can see their true beauty			1
‘ whether , it ’s tucked down deep inside or whatever it is – most of these women for the very first time would n't acknowledge that they ’re beautiful			0
so i put them in a pretty dress and i pose them so they feel good about themselves			0
‘ then when i turn the camera around , they can not believe it ’s them			0
in fact , i ’ve had a lot of woman cry because they can not believe the beautiful woman in that photograph is them			0
' mrs @entity18 's daughter , @entity27 wears vintage occasionally , dressed in 1950s floral dresses or pencil skirts and beautiful blouses when the family get together , they dine at an authentic 1950 's diner before they head to the skyline drive - in to watch a movie the kitchen comes complete with 50s kitchen utensils , a lemon - coloured @entity110 , a @entity112 fridge and an early @entity114 gas oven when the family get together , they occasionally visit the local skyline drive - in and dine at an authentic 1950 ’s restaurant			1
‘ there ’s nothing better than going to the drive - ins with the family – you go to the diner and you have a chilli dog or hot dog – it ’s very @entity248 style and you sit in your car and watch the movie with your family – it ’s great fun , ' she said			1
when asked what her favourite collection was , she could n't decide between her @entity257 collection and her swimsuits			2
‘ my favourite is probably my 1950 's private swimsuit collection			2
i ’ve got some really stunning ones and i think they ’re just divine and flattering			0
they ’re modest so you ’re covering everything that you should be covering and you just feel good and feel like a million dollars when you wear them			0
' mrs @entity18 has been living the lifestyle for over 30 years and she 's grateful that her family have all shared the same interests and passion while the lifestyle is n’t everyone ’s cup of tea , @entity18 is grateful her family share the same interests and passion for the era that she does mrs @entity18 said while their lifestyle is n’t everyone ’s cup of tea , she 's grateful that her family share the same interests and passion for the era that she does			1
' not everyone is accepting of my lifestyle choices but that 's ok - each to their own , ' she said			1
‘ i believe that everybody should be able to do what they want and dress the way they choose in life – providing it does n’t hurt another human being			0
‘ there ’s nothing wrong with being different – its important to be different , not everybody needs to be the same			0
there ’s nothing wrong with being an individual and sharing your love for whatever it might be			0
‘ the people who step outside the box and have enough confidence really need to be applauded			0
