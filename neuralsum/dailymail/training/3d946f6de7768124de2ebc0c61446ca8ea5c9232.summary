president @entity0 will use his @entity1 tonight to push tax increases he knows the @entity4 - led @entity3 will never pass , let alone consider			1
he plans to put @entity4 on the defense by characterizing them as the party of big business and special interests while pushing democrats are the true champions of the middle class			1
although @entity0 has competed in his last election , his party must be able to show that if trusted with the @entity13 and the @entity14 again , it will advocate for a platform of reforms that will be a boon to average @entity18			1
president @entity0 will use his @entity1 address to push tax increases he knows the @entity4 - led @entity3 will never pass , let alone consider @entity0 is pictured here giving the 2014 @entity1 address			1
tonight he will give the first of two final speeches before a joint session of @entity3 with just two years left in office , @entity0 is running out of time to build his legacy , which includes digging his political party out of the rut it 's in			1
on his watch , @entity9 ceded the speaker 's gavel to the @entity4 after a blow out election in 2010 that followed a major effort , spearheaded by the @entity13 , to substantially reform the nation 's health care system			1
@entity9 managed to stop the bleeding two years later , keeping both the @entity14 and the @entity13 in the 2012 election			1
but the bandaging was only temporary , and in november , @entity4 seized the upper chamber and expanded their majority in the @entity13 to a size not seen since the last @entity44			1
while @entity9 were defending the president 's health care law and forthcoming immigration actions , @entity4 were successfully arguing that they would pass a slew of jobs bills targeted at the middle class if propelled to power			1
and since taking office , they 've lined up a series of votes intended to embarrass @entity9 and force them into politically uncomfortable positions , including a vote to approve the @entity57 , which @entity4 and the makers of the conduit claim will create north of 42,000 jobs a year			1
the @entity4 has also seized on several opportunities to amend the president 's health law , @entity62 , one of which even received the backing of the @entity13			1
that measure exempted veterans who already have health care through the government from being counted toward the number of workers that qualify for employer - sponsored health insurance			0
for small businesses on the cusp of exceeding 50 workers , the point at which the employer mandate takes effect , the measure could serve as an incentive to bring on unemployed veterans of the armed services			0
unwilling to explain their opposition to legislation that would encourage businesses to ' hire more heroes , ' @entity9 and the @entity13 threw their support behind the bill this month			1
the @entity13 hopes to turn the tables on @entity4 during tonight 's @entity1 address and make full use of the age - old adage that the @entity4 cares more about the millionaires and billionaires of the country than it does middle class families			1

letter writer , @entity110 @entity111 , @entity112 , and his wife , @entity113 @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity117 researcher @entity118 , @entity18 astronaut @entity119 , student , @entity120 although @entity0 has competed in his last election , his party must be able to show that if trusted with the @entity13 and the @entity14 again , it will advocate for a platform of reforms that will be a boon to average @entity18 - something @entity0 plans to lay the groundwork for tonight in his address at the @entity155 , pictured here early this morning			1
the government hub is currently under renovation @entity0 will tap into that sentiment by proposing $ 320 billion in tax increases over the next 10 years to pay for everything from community college for hard - working high school students to tax credits for couples earning a combined income of up to $ 210,000 - all of which he will detail in full in his annual budget , due to come out feb. 2 this year			1
the two main revenue increases included in @entity0 's plan would affect banks with more than $ 50 billion in assets , roughly 100 institutions in @entity18 , and a tax increase would affect married couples earning more than $ 500,000 a year			1
the suggested fee on big banks is meant to discourage financial institutions from engaging in the risky behaviors that led to the 2008 crash , the @entity13 says			2
new taxes on the 1 percent would make up the bulk of the cash the federal government would need to fund @entity0 's favored programs			2
@entity0 wants to raise high - income earners ' capital gains tax to 28 percent from 20 percent and eliminate a tax loophole that allows the wealth to avoid paying fees to the government on their inheritances			2
dubbed the ' @entity193 tax , ' @entity4 have already declared the measure dead on arrival			2
' this is not a serious proposal , ' @entity196 , a spokesman for @entity198 chairman @entity197 , told the @entity201			0
' we lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler , flatter tax code , not big tax increases to pay for more @entity208 spending			1
' in a speech at the @entity212 this morning , sen. @entity209 , chairman of the @entity14 ' @entity210 , accused @entity0 of attempting to incite ' class warfare			2
' @entity209 has set his sights on reforming the tax code			0
@entity0 's plan ' appears to be more about redistribution , ' he said , per @entity218 , which ' is unfortunate , because we ’re going to need real leadership from the @entity13 - not just liberal talking points - if tax reform is going to be successful			1
' the proposals are n't meant to thrill @entity4			2
if anything , @entity0 's speech is meant to incite the opposing party and show them that the @entity13 has no intention of giving up any ground , regardless of the walloping its party received in the last election			1
@entity0 was elected to the bully pulpit for an eight - year term , and he plans to use it , @entity13 officials have asserted			2
' the president ’s going to take this opportunity to make the case directly to the @entity18 people why we can , and in fact need to , move forward on an agenda like this , ' a senior administration official told reporters during a call previewing the @entity1			0
' we are hopeful that what we will see is a positive response , particularly from those who have championed similar ideas in the past , ' the official added , according to @entity252			0
senate majority leader @entity254 , a @entity255 @entity4 , said today based on previews of @entity0 's speech , the president misinterpreted the results of the midterm elections			1
' the @entity18 people are n’t demanding talking - point proposals designed to excite the base but not designed to pass , ' @entity259 said in a speech before the @entity14 today			0
' what they said they ’re hungry for is substance and accomplishment			0
they want @entity208 to get back to work and focus on a serious jobs and reform agenda			0
they said they ’re ready to see more constructive cooperation , especially on bipartisan jobs initiatives , ' he said , name - checking the @entity57 pipeline , which the @entity14 will take a series of votes on today			2
@entity0 has said he would veto @entity57 legislation if it passes both chambers of @entity3			2
the @entity13 has already ok 'd the project			2
not with enough votes to override the the president , though			0
the bill survived a procedural vote in the @entity14 last week , and it 's expected to pass with slightly fewer votes than necessary to nullify an executive action snuffing it out			0
@entity259 said today the legislation ' will be on the president ’s desk before long			0
we see no reason for him to veto these jobs			0
' but whatever he decides , we ’re going to keep working for positive , middle - class jobs ideas here in @entity3			0
as i ’ve said before , we ’re not here to protect the president from a good idea			0
' and if the president ’s willing to work with us , there ’s much we can get accomplished for the @entity18 people , ' he added			0
@entity14 @entity4 have more to lose heading into the next election cycle than the president or his party , though , and @entity0 's gamble could pay off			1
in 2014 just 10 @entity4 senators were on the ballot			2
in less than two years @entity4 will have to defend 24 seats , including several in states that @entity0 won in the last election			1
and if @entity316 makes a bid for the presidency , they 'll have to find someone to run in his stead in the swing state that often decides national elections			0
the @entity324 senator has said he wo n't compete for reelection and higher office at the same time			0
@entity255 sen. @entity327 may also find himself in a bind in 2016 as his state 's election laws do not allow politicians to appear on the ballot twice for two separate positions			0
@entity327 's @entity14 seat is also up for reelction in two years and he is likely to run for president .			0

will try to force *republicans* on the defense by characterizing them as the party of big business and democrats as champions of the middle class
@entity0 is running out of time to build his legacy , which includes digging his political party out of the rut it 's in
@entity4 have lined up a series of votes intended to embarrass @entity9 and force them into politically uncomfortable positions
@entity13 hopes to turn the tables on @entity4 ; @entity0 will propose $ 320 billion in tax increases over the next 10 years , mostly on the rich
