by @entity0 published : 07:37 est , 6 february 2014 @entity2 : 07:38 est , 6 february 2014 an @entity4 woman has finally won her freedom after a two - year battle for religious divorce from her husband			1
@entity9 has been granted a ' get ' by her ex-husband @entity10 , after the pair legally divorced in 2012			1
three months ago the 25 - year - old opened up about her struggle to untangle herself from her ex-husband , who exerted his control over her by manipulating @entity17 law			1
@entity9 , 25 , divorced her husband @entity10 in 2012			1
after a four - year battle to be granted a ' get ' - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by @entity17 law , she has finally won her freedom the law student , who lives in @entity24 , @entity25 , told the @entity26 she divorced mr @entity10 in 2012 , but spent years trying to get him to grant her the ' get ' - a document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognised by @entity17 law			1
without the document , she was seen as an agunah - a chained woman - in the eyes of the @entity4 community , who considered her still married to mr @entity10			1
the mother - of - one from @entity24 , @entity25 , explained that her husband - whom she said has always been a controlling man - comes from a respected rabbinic family , making it all the more difficult to loosen herself from his power			2
after numerous attempts to reach an agreement , all met with the same defiance , ms @entity9 has decided to make her story public in an effort to move on with her life			2
she says she saw signs that mr @entity10 would be a difficult husband just three days into their marriage in 2009 , when they spent their first @entity51 together in complete silence			2
explaining that the observance is typically a female tradition , she says he lost his temper when she was telling him how it was done in her family			0
' when my way contradicted his way , he criticized me and turned angry , ' she wrote			0
her husband then told her : ' you have no choice			0
it 's not my way ' - an attitude he was to exhibit consistently over the following four years			0
the couple separated within a year of getting married , prompting a bitter battle between their @entity4 families , with @entity10 reportedly demanding upwards of $ 350,000 to settle the matter			1
miss @entity9 told the @entity26 , in november : ' on my last mission to ask for a get , a month ago , @entity10 said , " i ca n’t give you a get — how else would i control you ? " ' i think that ’s the key to it all			1
he insists the marriage is n’t over until he says it ’s over			0
' a @entity77 group @entity76 : tell @entity10 to give his wife a ' get ' was set up , attracting more than 14,000 supporters across the world			2
miss @entity9 's publicist , @entity81 , said she could not say why @entity10 had changed his mind			2
the @entity10 family , when approached for comment , declined			0
miss @entity81 said miss @entity9 and her family have vowed to set up a not - for - profit organisation to help other women facing similar problems win their freedom			1
refusing to grant a get is viewed in @entity17 law as domestic abuse , but mr @entity10 had said he would sign only if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $ 350,000 she added : ' the family is n't just skipping into the sunset			1
there 's a real sense of responsibility here			0
' mr @entity10 not only took control when it came to religious observances , but also when it came to the couple 's finances , despite his wife being the sole breadwinner			0
when she suggested couples therapy , he refused , and every attempt to communicate was met with silence and hostility			0
it was when she became pregnant that she decided to take a stand against her overbearing other half			0
' i thought : " how can i bring a child into this world with a virtual stranger ? someone i 'm so disconnected from ? " ' she said			0
mr @entity10 ultimately granted her a divorce - after first attempting to file for sole custody of their son @entity121			2
he repeatedly refused to give her a get , something which in @entity17 law is viewed as domestic abuse			1
as a man he was free to date other women , while his ex-wife was stuck in limbo in a community where her moving on would have been classed as adultery .			0

@entity9 was legally divorced from @entity10 in 2012
but for years he refused to give her a get - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognised by @entity17 law
without a get , she was still seen as married in her community , and would be ostracised if she were to move on romantically
three months after *speaking* publicly about her struggle the 25 - year - old has finally received the document allowing her to move on
she has vowed to set up a not - for - profit organisation to help other women facing similar problems
