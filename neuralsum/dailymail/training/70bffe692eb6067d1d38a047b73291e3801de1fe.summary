by @entity0 the destruction of a small @entity4 satellite shows the growing threat space junk poses to activities in low - @entity8 orbit , experts have warned			1
@entity4 's @entity9 in the @entity11 nanosatellite is thought to have been obliterated by a collision with a piece of debris left spinning around the planet by a @entity17 anti-satellite weapon test in 2007			1
the @entity8 is surrounded by an ever - growing cloud of space junk , which @entity20 has estimated contains 500,000 objects bigger than a marble , and 22,000 bigger than a cricket ball			1
rubbish : @entity20 has estimated the ever - growing cloud of space junk surrounding our planet contains 500,000 objects bigger than a marble , and 22,000 bigger than a softball			1
( @entity29 's impression ) with the debris in low - @entity8 orbit spinning around the planet at speeds of about 17,500mph , even tiny pieces can cause serious damage to satellites and pose a deadly hazard to astronauts			1
some 70 per cent of catalogued space junk objects are in low - @entity8 orbit , which extends to 1,250 miles about the surface of our planet			1
to be able to observe the @entity8 , spacecraft must orbit at such a low altitude - any further and their instruments are unable to pick out details			2
the latest collision happened six weeks ago , on january 22 , and is just the latest case of space junk destroying human technology in space			0
@entity53 , a technical adviser with the @entity54 , which is campaigns for the peaceful use of space technology , told @entity58 : ' it 's not the wake - up call — we 've had too many of those already			0
' many satellites in @entity64 [ low - @entity8 orbit ] are having to maneuver on a regular basis to avoid threatening close approaches with debris			1
' this is just one more data point that shatters the myth of the " big sky " theory regarding space activities and shows that debris is one of the most pressing threats satellite operators in @entity64 have to contend with			0
' danger : with the debris in low - @entity8 orbit spinning around the planet at speeds of about 17,500mph , even tiny pieces can cause serious damage to satellites and pose a deadly hazard to astronauts mr @entity53 cited a 2009 article by @entity89 of the @entity90 which documents three previous suspected cases of collisions between active satellites and space junk in 1996 , 2007 and 2009			1
since the first object , @entity97 , was launched into space 53 years ago , mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris			0
the rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets , abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel			0
it is estimated that there are 500,000 pieces of space junk floating in @entity8 's orbit			2
the picture above shows a ball of twisted metal , thought to be fallen space junk , on a farm in @entity116 , @entity117 , in 2008			0
dr @entity89 , co-director of the union 's @entity119 , wrote : ' because of the large number of active satellites in space ( more than 900 ) and the very large amount of debris , we estimate that a collision between a piece of debris larger than 1cm ( 0.4in ) with some active satellite in a near - @entity8 orbit would occur on average every two to three years over the next decade ( prior to several debris - producing events in 2007 , our estimate was a collision every five to six years )			1
' the observed collisions in 1996 , 2007 , and 2009 seem to roughly agree with this estimate			0
' one such ' debris - producing event ' referred to by dr @entity89 in his article was , of course the testing of an anti-satellite missile by @entity17 in 2007			2
the country used a missile to destroy a weather satellite more than 500 miles above the @entity8 in a show of military might that is thought to have added about 3,000 pieces of debris to the space junk cloud surrounding our planet			2
diplomatic documents leaked by @entity152 later revealed that the @entity153 warned @entity17 it could take military action in response to @entity157 ’s use of space missiles			0
and it emerged that the @entity153 even shot down one of its own satellites to demonstrate its ballistic power after @entity17 's missile test			2
@entity164 , the former head of @entity20 's @entity165 , told @entity58 the space junk problem is still manageable , since satellite operators can take precautions to safeguard their spacecraft			0
however , he added , the danger is increasing and , if no agreement can be made to limit the amount of rubbish left in orbit such minor precautions will no longer be enough .			0

@entity4 nanosatellite thought to have been destroyed in collision with debris left over from 2007 @entity17 space weapon test
@entity20 estimates that there are already more than 500,000 objects bigger than a marble in low - @entity8 orbit
such debris spins around our planet at speeds of 17,500mph , posing serious hazards to satellites and a deadly risk to astronauts
