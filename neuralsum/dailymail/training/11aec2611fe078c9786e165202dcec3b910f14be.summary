by @entity1 reporter published : 17:28 est , 12 july 2013 updated : 17:38 est , 12 july 2013 high demand : @entity3 has already been reserved by thousands of women it goes on sale for the first time today , but it seems the latest face cream that promises miraculous results is already a sellout hit with women			1
some 15,000 have downloaded vouchers online for a sample of the @entity15 anti-ageing cream , which claims to give you a ‘ flawless complexion ’ by using the reflection of light			1
and more than 3,000 have reserved the product , made by @entity21			1
in fact , its makers claim , demand is so high that they have set up a helpline for those who discover their nearest pharmacy has run out			1
the product comes as a lotion or a serum and is said to even out the skin ’s complexion and remove dark spots and shadows			2
it apparently contains three types of sugars called glycans which reflect light and make the skin more radiant			1
glycans occur naturally in our skin but gradually decline as we age , which is partly why our complexion becomes duller , less flexible and more uneven			0
the creams cost from £ 35 to £ 82 , depending on the size of the bottle , and are aimed at women over 25			1
@entity50 , general manager of @entity21 , said the product was a ‘ world first ’ which had taken three years to develop			1
‘ our research has shown that women are now more concerned about age spots and uneven skin tone than they are about wrinkles , ’ she said			2
‘ @entity3 recreates truly luminous skin			0
it also significantly reduces the appearance of age spots , the tell - tale areas of darker pigmentation which distinguish an older face from the smooth , uniform complexion of youth , and gives skin a flawless look			0
’ the manufacturers claim that after one week of using the cream skin is ‘ noticeably ’ improved , and after two months red and dark spots will lighten and the complexion will become ‘ more uniform ’			2
face of youth : model @entity73 advertises the product which is so popular that @entity21 has set up a helpline for women whose local pharmacy runs out but experts dismissed such promises and said it was usually impossible for any cream to banish all blemishes			1
dr @entity84 , a cosmetic surgeon for @entity85 , said : ‘ skin tone and pigmentation are so subjective			0
‘ there is no miracle treatment			2
as soon as you go back into the sun or get a bit of a tan , all pigmentation will come back			0
you can reduce it but it can easily return			0
’ he added : ‘ even the medically based products that have been clinically proven have a limited efficacy for removing pigmentation			0
’ dr @entity96 , a cosmetic dermatologist based in @entity97 , said : ‘ i do n’t know of any topical non-prescription product that will make a major impact on red areas , which usually reflect the presence of dilated blood vessels in the skin as a consequence of either sun damage or rosacea			0
