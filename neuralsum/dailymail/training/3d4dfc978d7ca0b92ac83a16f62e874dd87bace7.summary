@entity0 the tourist : @entity2 enjoys the nightlife in @entity4 , @entity5 , on saturday before heading to @entity6 he boasted recently of having ‘ toiled over years ’ to bring peace to the @entity8 – and wrote of his concern at the ‘ living nightmare ’ in @entity11			1
but if @entity2 was toiling in his role as @entity14 to the long - troubled region last week , it is apparently nice work if you can get it			1
while western governments reacted with fury to claims of a chemical weapons attack in @entity23 and made moves towards launching air strikes on @entity11 regime forces , the ex-prime minister was spotted in some of the most glamorous locations in the @entity28			1
mr @entity2 ’s busy schedule at the back end of last week involved visiting several ‘ super-yachts ’ worth in excess of £ 100million – apparently three of them in the space of three days			1
but his role might be expected to see him take a wider interest in the region , and indeed the latest post on his official website – ‘ there is hope amid the turmoil of the @entity8 ’			1
it is dated august 4 – makes several references to @entity11 , where the chemical attack was first reported on wednesday			2
but a day later , on thursday , mr @entity2 jetted into @entity6 on a private jet , and was whisked away to dine at a restaurant in the glamorous resort of @entity59			1
mr @entity2 , 60 , is familiar with this idyllic spot , having famously visited with wife @entity61 in 2004 for a free holiday at the 27 - bedroom villa of since - disgraced @entity65 premier and billionaire @entity64			1
that jolly was much remarked on at the time – both because @entity69 were appalled at their leader accepting hospitality from such a sleazy right - wing host , and the fact @entity64 sported a ridiculous bandana during their public appearances , to conceal the aftermath of a hair transplant			0
on his latest visit mr @entity2 enjoyed the hospitality of a different billionaire			1
for after his evening meal last thursday , he stepped on to a swish motor launch and was ferried out to board a magnificent 377ft super-yacht , the @entity84 , the 16th - largest gin palace in the world			0
previously owned by @entity37 billionaire and @entity90 football club - owner @entity89 , it was given to his ex-wife @entity91 two years ago as part of their £ 200million divorce settlement			0
special delivery : @entity2 arrives in @entity6 , via private jet , to have ' meetings with various people , ' according to his spokesman all aboard : mr @entity2 spent thursday evening on the @entity84 , owned by @entity40 music mogul @entity100 , worth over £ 150million it is now owned by @entity40 music mogul @entity100 , 70 , one of the few people in the world with enough money to pay the 46 crew the yacht needs – and to hand over the £ 150million - plus the pleasure craft reportedly cost him			1
remarkably , the @entity84 is mr @entity100 ’s easy - to - berth runaround – his main yacht is the 453ft rising @entity112 news of mr @entity2 ’s enthusiasm for the billionaire ’s yachts emerged a year ago , when it was reported that he had been seen on board one of them off @entity118			1
and on his latest stay on board a @entity123 craft , mr @entity2 seems to have taken the opportunity to visit an even bigger yacht – as onlookers last thursday saw it draw alongside the @entity128 , at 483ft the sixth largest in the world			1
out with the lads : @entity2 leaves @entity132 restaurant on @entity133 , @entity4 to board 167ft yach @entity135 , whose owner is not yet known no worries : the former prime minister appeared to have other things on his mind as reports came from @entity23 about chemical weapons attacks @entity2 today demanded that @entity143 and the @entity40 launch military action in @entity11			1
the former prime minister compared the violent @entity146 regime and its murdering of its own citizens with chemical weapons to the ' dark days of @entity151 '			2
mr @entity2 , who took @entity143 to war in @entity153 and @entity154 , said this morning that it is ' time we took sides '			2
' people wince at the thought of intervention			0
but contemplate the future consequence of inaction and shudder , ' he wrote in @entity164			0
this morning @entity165 returned early from his @entity167 holiday to consider whether to recall @entity168			0
@entity69 are demanding a binding vote over plans to launch missile strikes on @entity11 without the backing of the @entity38			0
mr @entity2 urged the government to ignore ' the impulse to stay clear of turmoil '			2
' i understand every impulse to stay clear of the turmoil , to watch but not to intervene , to ratchet up language but not to engage in the hard , even harsh business of changing reality on the ground			0
' but we have collectively to understand the consequences of wringing our hands instead of putting them to work			0
' owned by the royal family of the @entity188 , it is valued at a colossal £ 340million , has eight decks , and even a choice of swimming pools			0
@entity193 though his surroundings were , mr @entity2 soon moved on			2
and on saturday he was spotted in the perennial playground of the international playboy , @entity4			2
on land he was surrounded by a team of ever - watchful security guards , but seemed to relax when back on the ocean wave , this time on a motorised launch of the new hi - tech super-yacht @entity135			0
mr @entity2 had been on @entity203 beach , where fashion tycoon sir @entity204 was throwing a party at the @entity206 for guests including @entity208			2
the former premier was not a guest , instead dining at the @entity212 restaurant , but clearly had bigger fish to fry – for he had a broad grin as he was whisked away by four smartly uniformed crew on a launch from his third super-yacht of the weekend			0
crazy me is 167ft long and crafted entirely from aluminium with ‘ an aggressive and unique profile ’			0
she boasts both a master suite and a vip stateroom , and has a glass - bottomed swimming pool on the upper deck			0
only recently completed , she was delivered to her mystery owner in june			0
last night a spokesman for mr @entity2 refused to discuss who he had been visiting or what he had been doing on the series of super-yachts in the @entity28 while the @entity11 crisis unfolded			1
the tight - lipped spokesman would add only that ‘ he was having meetings with various people ’ .			1

@entity2 jetted to the @entity28 as news broke of chemical attacks
@entity8 ' special envoy ' visited @entity4 and *luxury* yachts
@entity2 was ' having meetings with various people , ' spokesman said
