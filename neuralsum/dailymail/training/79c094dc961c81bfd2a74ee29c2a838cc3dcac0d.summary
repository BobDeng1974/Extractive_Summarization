beyond the fridge full of @entity2 ham in his office , the enduring memory of an hour or so in the company of @entity7 this time last year was the clarity of his thought and the freshness of his ideas			1
even when it came to his diet , he appeared to have a unique recipe for success			0
he would eat carbohydrates in the evening to fuel the brain because he liked to do much of his thinking at night			0
but he would eat nothing immediately before a game because he wanted the blood in his brain rather than in his stomach when providing direction from the technical area			0
it was an interview from which you emerged feeling educated			0
you could see , 22 @entity32 games into his tenure at @entity34 , why his side were reflecting on just two defeats			1
his attention to detail , even in this era of a more scientific approach to sport , was impressive			0
@entity7 's @entity34 side have fallen from @entity44 contenders to the bottom half staff at the club ’s @entity48 training ground appeared to be in awe of their @entity52 leader			1
understandably , they had been unsettled by the departure of @entity56 but @entity7 had made the transition easier than they had perhaps feared , employing charm , charisma and drive to get everyone , from the star players to the secretaries , buying into his regime			1
today , the majority of players at @entity34 continue to like @entity7 ’s style as manager			1
one senior dressing room source described him this week as a ‘ courageous , tactically astute coach ’ who encourages them to fear no - one			0
they have found his approach to the bigger games particularly refreshing			0
@entity7 sends them out to play with ambition rather than inhibition			1
but something has changed for the worse in @entity7 ’s second season in charge , as nine defeats in their first 22 games demonstrated prior to a much - needed victory at @entity86 last weekend			1
a 3 - 0 defeat at @entity88 was one of four in a row over @entity91 and nine in the league this season @entity94 and @entity95 had a penalty row during @entity34 's draw against @entity98 the @entity99 decided to relieve @entity94 of his penalty - taking duties , but missed the spot - kick @entity7 's side lie 12th in the @entity32 ‘ there is a danger they are turning into his @entity114 team , ’ said another qualified observer , and while that might seem harsh , the 34 league goals they have so far conceded amounts to the joint - fifth worst defensive record in the top flight			1
this week @entity7 shared his thoughts on why , pointing to the additional burden of @entity118 football and the number of injuries			1
‘ remember we had a player in @entity127 last season who played in every game , ’ he said before also pointing to the absence of @entity122 and @entity123 , among others			0
some point to a deeper problem , however : to the impact the departure of certain staff has had on dressing room , and club , morale			1
in that same interview last year , @entity7 said ‘ he wanted to change things without losing anything ’ in recognition of the club @entity56 had so successfully created			1
but some changes have been regarded by some as heavy losses			0
@entity146 resigned as head of medicine in december , while conditioning coach @entity149 left in the summer and another fitness coach , @entity150 , before that			1
there is nothing new in a manager bringing in his own staff but these three particular members of the backroom staff were regarded by many as the oil in the machine			2
‘ they were very popular with the players , and trusted , ’ said one dressing room source			1
‘ they would keep the ship sailing			0
’ a physiotherapist who had been at @entity167 for more than a decade , @entity146 is the son of former assistant manager @entity168 and regarded as something of an innovator when it comes to the management of injuries			0
but it seems he may have clashed with @entity7 , himself a qualified physiotherapist , over the treatment of injuries , which may have led to his departure			2
@entity146 alluded to as much in an interview he gave to a professional publication last season			0
the @entity34 manager has seen some of the club 's key staff leave over the last year @entity7 's @entity34 side take on @entity187 in the @entity189 derby at @entity167 on saturday ‘ it ’s not inconceivable to find yourself in a position where the athlete and the coaching staff are desperate to play in the next game and you know it ’s not in their best interest , ’ said @entity146			1
‘ this is when your communication skills come into play , by convincing the management it is the best thing for the player and hence the team and explain and cajole the player into preparing for the more sensible option			0
’ @entity146 is currently on gardening leave but is sure to be in demand			0
much has been made of @entity34 ’s injury record since @entity7 took charge , in particular the 18 hamstring injuries in his first 18 months in charge			1
@entity214 examined the club ’s injury record in more detail and can report that in @entity7 ’s 20 months in charge there have been 105 injuries , 85 of them to key players			1
compare that to the last 20 months of @entity56 ’s tenure : 93 injuries with 60 to key players			2
not a huge difference , but a rise all the same			0
one reason being given is ‘ too much ball work ’ which probably demands medical expertise to explain but appears to suggest @entity7 believes in certain training methods that place the body under more stress than it is used to			2
@entity233 joined @entity34 in the summer , but left for @entity234 in january after a very short spell there are other issues that often arise when a team is not getting results : claims of unhappy senior players and personality clashes			1
@entity233 , who was at the club for only the briefest of spells , is understood to have been a central figure in training ground disputes			2
concerns have been raised over the players ’ fitness			1
once a strength of @entity34 teams driven hard by @entity56 , there have been times this season when the same players have looked sluggish and heavy - legged			1
some blame it on a softening of the spirit , on @entity7 ’s failure to take the appropriate action when there has been a dip in standards			2
@entity7 always seems keen to see the positive in everything			2
only this week he insisted he saw ‘ a focused face ’ in that rather amusing photograph of @entity275 when everyone else saw a player seemingly unhappy to be on loan in the north west of @entity272			0
@entity275 joined @entity34 on loan from @entity277 until the end of the season @entity275 gave a stern expression in his official photos after signing for @entity34 on loan it is said to frustrate some players that @entity7 is too soft when the misfiring team is crying out for the tough discipline his predecessor used to administer			1
‘ the team had a fighting spirit that seems to have disappeared , ’ said one insider			0
and yet here ’s the thing			0
players supposedly wanting @entity7 to get tough were then heard to complain about a training trip to @entity294 last week			1
it was all work and no play			0
‘ @entity302 , ’ was one verdict , even if it was followed by that win at @entity301			0
the players were said to be less offended than they perhaps should have been when @entity95 decided to relieve @entity94 of the penalty - taking duties against @entity98 last month , only to miss. but it was also noted that @entity7 did not confront @entity95 at half - time , mainly because the @entity308 forward never appeared in the dressing room having instead dived into the treatment room and declared himself unfit to play the second half			1
@entity313 's goal at @entity301 earned @entity34 a much - needed first victory in seven games given the opportunity to respond this week , @entity7 rejected the idea that changes in the backroom staff were to blame for what has been a disappointing campaign , one that he hopes will finally take off against @entity187 on saturday			1
‘ no , no , not at all , no , ’ he said in response to a question about @entity146 and his colleagues			2
‘ it has been more in the playing staff if anything			0
i do n’t think the staff changes have affected us			0
‘ @entity146 ( @entity329 ) had a terrific time with @entity34 and when you make your own decision you ’re not pushed away			2
when you make your own decision it is probably the best for everyone as it means you are not enjoying what you do			0
i do n’t think it has had an effect on the team at all , not on the performance of the team			0
’ @entity56 was renowned for his tough discipline during his time as @entity34 manager and he might be right			2
it might be a wider issue			0
it might be a broad spectrum of issues that a manager encounters when he succeeds a long - serving , successful manager , in particular once he starts making changes to a professional environment that the players had grown used to			0
it might be that @entity7 is now enduring the sort of difficulties @entity56 encountered at @entity359 , and which @entity360 is encountering now			2
it might be that not until @entity34 have emerged from transition , and @entity7 has things exactly how he wants them , will they perform with the consistency they achieved under @entity56			1
when @entity7 moved into @entity48 he had a wall on one staircase decorated with photographs of the club ’s glory days , leaving a blank space for what he hoped would be the second @entity373 triumph of his career			1
now it seems likely to remain blank for a while , however clear an idea @entity7 might have of what happens next .			2

@entity7 is seen as a soft touch by the players
@entity34 have fallen from @entity44 contention to bottom half
a number of @entity34 's trusted staff have left the club
question marks have been raised over the players ' fitness levels
