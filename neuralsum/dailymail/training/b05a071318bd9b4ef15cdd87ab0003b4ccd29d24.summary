plea : @entity0 has made a last - ditch appeal to @entity3 voters to oppose independence in tomorrow 's referendum this is it			1
after two years of campaigning , criss - crossing the length and breadth of @entity3 , only 24 hours remain before we make the biggest political decision of our lives			1
the only question to ask yourself before you go to the polling booth is do you know what will happen if @entity3 decides to break away from the @entity17			1
day in , day out , i have asked @entity20 questions			1
i have asked him what currency @entity3 will use , who will pay @entity3 ’s pensions , if there will be a new border , if @entity3 will be a member of the @entity28			1
and if @entity3 will be a member of @entity30			1
the campaign trail is littered with unanswered questions			1
mr @entity20 bluffs and blusters , he make assertions			1
and now , for the third time in this campaign , this week we find he has been deceiving us on , of all things , our @entity42			1
it has been some saga			1
first of all , he told us @entity45 could privatise the health service in @entity3			1
responsibility for health care in @entity3 is completely devolved to the @entity3 parliament			1
mr @entity20 is , in fact , the only person in @entity3 who could privatise the health service			1
then we find the @entity3 parliament is spending less than its budget allocation on health , so as health spending goes up in the rest of the @entity17 , in @entity3 it goes down			1
@entity3 ’s spending priorities are decided at @entity59 , nowhere else			1
they could improve the @entity42 ; they could invest more in the @entity61 ; but they do n’t			1
instead , they have spent less on health in @entity64 than their counterparts in @entity66 , @entity67 and @entity68			1
and as if that was n’t bad enough , we now find health boards throughout @entity3 are facing draconian cuts of around £ 450million			1
we were not meant to know until friday , the day after @entity3 went to the polls , but thanks to a leaked report we know now			1
it is not a report drawn up by politicians , but by finance directors and @entity3 government officials			1
debate : mr @entity0 has repeatedly clashed with @entity20 over @entity3 's plans for independence @entity83 - to - head : the two rivals were interviewed by @entity86 in @entity87 on sunday how dare mr @entity20 try to deceive us , to let us vote on a false prospectus			1
but we should not be surprised			1
he has a track record			1
when asked if he sought legal advice on @entity3 joining the @entity28 , he said he had			1
he spent taxpayers ’ money going to court to stop the publication of that advice and then we found it did n’t exist in the first place			1
and then , only last month , the @entity98 took the unprecedented step of publicly denying @entity100 claims that they had discussed plans for a currency union			1
the @entity98 said there had been no such talks			1
i have been accused of scaremongering			2
it is not scaremongering to tell the truth			2
i do n’t think it is scaremongering to ask questions			2
i think it is my patriotic duty			2
every pensioner in @entity3 deserves to know how their pension will be paid			2
they need to know it will be safe			2
at the moment , the @entity17 guarantees the pensions throughout the @entity17			2
the costs are spread across 60million people			2
if @entity3 breaks away , @entity3 pensioners will be dependent on five million people in @entity3			2
down to the wire : the polls are almost tied in the independence referendum with just a day to go passion : a pro-independence rally in central @entity128 today attracted a large crowd in the next few years , @entity3 will have a bigger proportion of retirement age inhabitants and fewer people working than in other parts of the @entity17			1
no matter how you look at it , the circle is hard to square			2
where will the money come from ? @entity20 has said the @entity100 would be willing to pay pensions to people earlier if the @entity17 breaks up			1
the independent experts at the @entity141 have said a separate @entity3 would face extra cuts of £ 6billion			2
that ’s equivalent to nearly the entire pensions budget at present – far less unfunded promises in the future			2
whatever decision is made tomorrow , there is no going back			2
whatever the outcome , we ca n’t change our minds			2
i hear people say this referendum is a battle between head and heart			2
well , believe me , my head says no. but my heart says no too			0
for @entity3 ’s sake , for the sake of my children and their children			0
@entity165 does not mean there will be no change			0
all three main parties have pledged to deliver more powers for @entity3			0
it makes sense to give @entity3 people control over our own daily lives while relying on the @entity17 to secure the defence , prosperity and welfare of every citizen			1
@entity3 have made a tremendous contribution to the @entity17 ’s success			0
we faced down fascism in the @entity181 , standing alone for many months ; we founded and built the most socially just health service in the world ; and the @entity17 had the strength to withstand the financial crash that crippled other countries			0
if we stay together , the @entity42 will be safer , our pensions will be more secure , our schools , further education colleges and universities will be protected and there will be greater employment opportunities for our children and our grandchildren			0
these are the issues i care about , and i believe the majority of @entity3 do too			0
campaign : mr darling at the centre of a crowd during a rally in @entity128 controversy : police officers outside a no campaign event to guard against potential unrest most serious businessmen and women in @entity3 want to stay in the @entity17			0
that is simply because they know what is best for business and what is best for jobs in @entity3			0
@entity3 sells twice as much to the rest of the @entity17 as it does to the rest of the world			0
around one million jobs in @entity3 are linked directly to trade with the rest of the @entity17			0
our shipbuilders want to stay within the @entity17 because they know the @entity64 will not commission ships in a foreign land			0
our farmers want to stay within the @entity17 because they know their biggest market is in @entity66			0
our manufacturers want to stay in the @entity17 because anything getting in the way of trade , such as borders and different tax regimes , is bad for them			0
everyone ’s vote tomorrow is crucial			0
it ’s not like a normal election , where it only counts in your constituency			0
@entity3 is one big constituency , so every vote counts the same			0
do n’t let the @entity240 tell you otherwise			0
and do n’t let them intimidate you either			0
they ’ll try and make out that somehow a no vote is a vote against @entity3			1
over the last few weeks , some of their extremists have been too eager to throw around words such as ‘ traitor ’ , ‘ quisling ’ and ‘ slave ’			0
well , they wo n’t bully me			0
do n’t let them bully you either			0
i do n’t want anyone who wants us to stay in the @entity17 to wake up on friday morning , to turn on the tv or the radio and realise they ’ve forgotten to act			0
by then , it will be too late			0
a single vote could decide this referendum			0
one more for @entity264 than @entity265 and that ’s it – the 307 - year - old @entity28 will end			0
there is no second chance , no rewind button , no point complaining we did n’t know			0
this is our only chance			0
i ’m not exaggerating when i say thursday is probably the most important day of our democratic lives			0
from 7am until 10pm , @entity3 and the @entity17 will be in limbo , and everything which we have built over these past three centuries will hang in the balance			0
for the sake of future generations , we should vote no tomorrow .			0
