but @entity4 has proved her strength by reaching the age of two - and thriving			1

@entity4 was delivered by emergency c - section when her mother was just 28 weeks pregnant			1
she weighed just 1lb 4oz and was given a less than 50 per cent chance of survival @entity4 , two , has defied the odds to become a healthy toddler despite being born three months early but despite being born by emergency c - section at just 28 weeks , @entity4 survived and is now a thriving two - year - old who is meeting all developmental targets			1

the staff at @entity33 were simply amazing - they brought her to life			2
‘ @entity4 ’s my little fighter			1
’ miss @entity4 , who works as a taxi controller , said she had no reason to suspect anything was wrong until @entity4 stopped moving at 28 weeks			1
she said : ‘ i woke up in the morning and i could n’t feel her moving			2
it gives me goose bumps to think about it even now			0
i thought it would be best to go for a scan to make sure everything was ok			0
‘ they gave me an injection and waited an hour , but @entity4 ’s heart - rate started to drop			1
they said they would have to get her out			0
@entity4 was delivered prematurely because her mother , @entity52 , went to hospital when she stopped moving in the womb			1
doctors soon discovered the baby 's heart rate was dropping and she was in danger ‘ @entity4 did n’t cry when she was lifted out of me , and she was rushed off to incubation			1
i was on sedatives , but i remember thinking “ where are they taking my baby ? ” it was an awful feeling			2
’ @entity4 was born on september 12th 2011 weighing 1lb 4oz , even less than the midwives had been expecting			1
it was later revealed that @entity4 had stopped developing at 23 weeks because the placenta had failed to form properly			1
two and a half hours after the delivery , miss @entity69 was finally able to see her daughter for the first time			0
@entity4 was in the neonatal ward , wrapped in a special plastic bag designed to help premature babies stay warm			1
when she was born , @entity4 was so small she was placed in a special plastic bag to help her stay warm @entity4 had stopped developing in the womb at 23 weeks because there was a problem with the placenta miss @entity4 said : ‘ it was shocking to see her like that			1
she looked just like a little raisin - her eyes were shut and her ears had n’t formed properly			2
her skin was almost see - through			2
she did n’t look like a baby at all			2
‘ i loved her the instant i saw her			0
but at the same time , she looked so vulnerable that i had to prepare myself for her fading away			0
’ two days later , she was able to hold her tiny daughter for the first time			0
she said : ‘ i cried my eyes out			0
i was so relieved to be able to hold my baby			2
up to then , i ’d felt so helpless - as if she was n’t my baby because i could n’t do anything for her			1
‘ that was the first time i really felt that she was mine and i became fiercely protective over her			0
‘ from that day i said to the nurses that i wanted to be involved more - i wanted to feed her , change her and look after her			2
’ @entity4 is still slim and small for her age but doctors say she will catch up with other children by the age of five when @entity4 was two months old , doctors feared they would lose her because she developed an infection miss @entity4 said : ' i loved her the instant i saw her			1
but at the same time , she looked so vulnerable that i had to prepare myself for her fading away			0
' image shows @entity4 with her older brother , @entity111 there was a tense moment when , at two months old , @entity4 fought off a serious chest infection			1
miss @entity4 said : ‘ i was sure we were going to lose her			1
it was heart - breaking to think she had been through so much , only to succumb to an infection at two months			1
‘ she was put back onto a lot of the medication and treatment which she had been weaned from , so it felt like a big step back			0
’ but finally , after three months , miss @entity69 was able to bring her daughter home to meet her big brother @entity111 , now nine			2
today , @entity4 is attending preschool just across the playground from where @entity111 is attending primary school , and is meeting all developmental targets			2
miss @entity4 says until @entity4 stopped moving she had no idea there was a problem with the pregnancy despite being born so early , @entity4 is developing normally and is reaching all of her developmental targets miss @entity4 said : ‘ @entity4 was discharged from monitoring in december and they no longer need to keep a special eye on her			1
‘ she ’s catching up height-wise but she ’s still very skinny			0
the doctors say she wo n’t be fully caught up until she ’s around five years old			0
despite her age she ’s still wearing clothes designed for 18 - month - old children			0
‘ but everyone ’s extremely happy with the way she ’s developed			0
her motor skills are more advanced than most children her age			0
she ’s running around and loves having conversations with other children at pre-school			0
‘ at home she ’s become my little side - kick			2
the only person more protective over her than me is @entity111			0
‘ when i reflect on how close we came to losing her , i ’m very grateful to everyone who helped us - the staff at @entity33 , and the volunteers with @entity160 , who help families with premature children			0
