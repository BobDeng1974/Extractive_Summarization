@entity0 would have been a cigarette and blindfold away from the firing line had @entity4 started as diabolically as they did against @entity5 at the @entity6 just one month ago			1
there , @entity4 were 3 - 0 down by half - time , their frail defence unable to cope with the presence of @entity10 and the runs behind of @entity12			1
there was no such problem at the @entity15 with a back four consisting of @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , replacing @entity20 after 13 minutes , as they got revenge for the humiliation felt on december 6			1
@entity10 and @entity16 battle during the @entity25 match which @entity4 won 3 - 0 @entity10 and @entity16 had a key battle at the @entity15 as the @entity4 defender comfortably won @entity20 is treated after being sent crashing into the electronic advertising boards on sunday @entity20 holds his injured shoulder as the physicality got going early on in the @entity25 match @entity17 ( no 6 ) started and finished @entity4 's opening goal after six minutes as this map shows click here for more statistics and goals one difference between then and now is @entity17			1
the 29 - year - old was left on the substitutes ' bench at the @entity6			0
without him @entity4 's win percentage is just 33 per cent , they concede 1.9 goals per game and they have three clean sheets since august 2013			1
with him it rises to 70 per cent , they concede just 0.7 and @entity5 was their 20th clean sheet			2
@entity17 got his reward , too , creating and scoring @entity4 's opening goal with a free header after just six minutes			1
@entity5 relied on set pieces , knowing you simply do n't out - pass @entity0 's @entity4			1
their reputation is for being overly physical , and @entity55 their cheerleader			0
@entity20 discovered that , receiving an unnecessary push from @entity59 to hit the electronic advertising boards and suffer a shoulder injury to complicate @entity0 's options			0
but it was @entity10 vs @entity16 that would also determine whether @entity4 could claim just their sixth @entity25 clean sheet			1
a 6ft 7in striker against his 6ft 6in marker			1
the first test soon arrived			0
hands all over one another , grappling in the box before the ball had even been delivered			0
but @entity5 tried something new			2
it was cut back for @entity75 instead of being thrown into the melee , though the 30 - year - old midfielder hit it high , wide , and into the stands			0
no more of those , the @entity5 manager shouted in more colourful language			2
@entity17 gets his head to the ball for the opening goal at the @entity15 against @entity5 @entity4 's win percentage rises substantially when @entity17 is playing and they concede less goals @entity17 's heat map as he dominated during the 3 - 0 win over @entity5 at the @entity15 ... click here for more then , in first half stoppage time , @entity10 finally had a header			1
it was the first time he 'd been given the chance , though it did not trouble @entity97 on his full @entity25 debut			0
@entity5 needed to test the rookie			2
they never got the chance			0
even @entity19 and @entity18 were given the freedom of the wing , dominating both the left and right			0
and so , while @entity0 may be looking longingly towards @entity107 at @entity108 , the man he feels is preventing traditional @entity111 defenders from becoming extinct , the @entity106 was given no scares from his back four against @entity5 this time			0
@entity19 ( left ) and @entity18 ( right ) got down the wing plenty as their heat maps show @entity19 ( left ) and @entity117 ( right ) were given little to worry about by @entity5 at the @entity15 on sunday @entity118 on defensive weakness ' they ’ve not gone man for man really on defending , it ’s always been zonal so they can get caught out			2
' @entity125 on set pieces ' set pieces are a weak spot			0
the little players like @entity130 or @entity131 are n’t going to offer you a lot defensively so you need your taller players , like @entity135 to come in and take responsibility			0
' @entity118 on @entity5 's danger man ' @entity5 have got players like @entity12 who can come in and get in behind the defence , in those pockets and that ’s what they ’ve got to watch out for			1

@entity4 beat @entity5 3 - 0 at the @entity15 in revenge for december defeat
@entity4 's 6ft 7in defender @entity16 took control of @entity5 's 6ft 6in striker @entity10
their win percentage goes from 33 to 70 and they concede *1.2* less goals when defender @entity17 is playing
@entity17 created and scored the opening goal after just six minutes
