traces of ash mixed with million - year - old bones and tools have been uncovered in the @entity7 in @entity8			2
burned plants and bones were found in the cave , suggesting that its inhabitants cooked and perhaps even socialised around camp fires			1
rock art in @entity15 from @entity16 @entity8 : @entity17 found in a layer dated at a million years old hints that inhabitants of the cave were using fire a million years ago skull of homo erectus , from @entity25 , @entity26 , 3 million years old : the discovery of ash among million - year - old remains in @entity8 hints that human ancestors as early as homo erectus might have used fire the huge cave near the edge of the @entity35 has been the scene of previous excavations which have uncovered an extensive record of human occupation			1
a team led by the @entity41 and @entity42 has identified the earliest known evidence of the use of fire by human ancestors			2
microscopic traces of wood ash alongside animal bones and stone tools were found in a layer dated to one million years ago			0
analysis of sediment has revealed ashed plant remains and burned bone fragments , both of which appear to have been burned locally rather than carried into the cave by wind or water			0
extensive evidence of surface discolouration that is typical of burning was also found			0
@entity41 anthropologist @entity64 said : ‘ the analysis pushes the timing for the human use of fire back by 300,000 years , suggesting that human ancestors as early as @entity70 may have begun using fire as part of their way of life			1
wonderwerk caves in @entity8 : the huge cave near the edge of the @entity35 has been the scene of previous excavations which have uncovered an extensive record of human occupation ‘ the control of fire would have been a major turning point in human evolution			1
‘ the impact of cooking food is well documented , but the impact of control over fire would have touched all elements of human society			0
‘ socialising around a camp fire might actually be an essential aspect of what makes us human			0
’ the research is published in the @entity98 today .			0
