@entity16 sports his new haircut after following @entity2 's lead @entity2 has caused a stir by getting ' @entity12 ' shaved into his head to show his patriotism @entity16 followed suit after being challenged by @entity6 captain @entity14 @entity16 has now taken up @entity14 on his challenge , with footage of the administrator being shorn posted on the @entity6 team 's @entity30 feed			1
a tweet read : ' @entity14 said @ tedbishop38pga should shave @entity12 in his hair if it would help us win			2
then there was really only one option			0
' @entity16 then gave an update , tweeting a picture of himself and @entity2 stood back - to - back and a message which read : ' it 's done			2
the @entity12 cut ! i believe we will win			2
' yet if 25 - year - old @entity2 , who had long hair in his younger days , intended for his dramatic new look to be intimidating , he may not be succeeding			0
@entity2 is well known for his outlandish personality - the @entity6 always wears the orange of his alma mater @entity49 on the final day of tournaments @entity2 ( left ) eyes up a putt with practice partner @entity53 as the @entity1 nears despite being the second youngest member of the @entity6 team @entity2 is expected to be a key player at @entity11 @entity58 's @entity57 , a veteran of eight previous @entity1 contests , certainly appears not to be fazed			1

but @entity57 was not fazed by @entity2 's daring trim the @entity1 veteran is raring to go as he prepares for a ninth @entity1 cap ' i find it quite amusing			1
it 's the sort of thing that a 25 - year - old lad that 's right behind his team does , i suppose			0

suits him , i think			0
