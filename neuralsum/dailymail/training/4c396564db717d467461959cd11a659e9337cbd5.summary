any fan of dr who knows the most astonishing thing about the @entity3 is that it 's bigger on the inside			0
now one imaginative fan has created his own @entity3 with this amazing feature , thanks to the nifty use of augmented reality ( @entity14 )			2
@entity15 , based in silicon valley in @entity17 , first set out to build a simple model of the famous police box after becoming bored over @entity20			1
scroll down for the video innovative : mr @entity15 used an augmented reality app to make his model @entity25 appear bigger on the inside when pointing his smartphone at it the technology wizard removed the front door of his mini @entity25 and replaced it with patterned material , to allow smartphone software to latch on to the model he created it over a few hours using wood , two bottles and some dark blue paint , before fixing a working red light on the top			1
' then my stupid brain went and thought ' hey would n't it be cool if it had an interior , ' mr @entity15 wrote on his blog			2
but how to defy the laws of physics and make it bigger on the inside ? first he created a @entity51 computer model of the interior using a free - to - use open source computer software programme called @entity54			1
he said it was a rough likeness to how it appeared during @entity58 's turn as the @entity59 from 2005 to 2010			1
the former @entity61 mobile editor then used the unity graphics rendering engine			1
rendering is the process of generating a 2d image from a 3d model stored in a scene file by using a computer program			1
this information describes the geometry , viewpoint , texture , lighting and shading of the virtual scene			0
augmented reality : when the phone moves around the blue box , the virtual image changes to reflect this the interior if the tardis is the same as the one featured during @entity58 's time as the doctor			1
here he 's pictured with @entity87 who played @entity88 finally he used an @entity14 app platform by chip - maker @entity90 called @entity91 , to allow a smartphone to interact with the mini @entity3			2
for this to work the smartphone software needed to latch on to part of the model so it could map out an appropriate view of the interior			1
mr @entity15 tried to use the ' free for use of @entity103 ' sign on the front as the marker but found it was too small			0
in the end he took off the front door and replaced it with a piece of material with a ' time - warp ' style black and white pattern			0
the software then used this to work out at what angle the interior image should be shown			2
the result , as his @entity118 video shows , is an impressive optical illusion			0
reaction to the invention online has been extremely favourable , with one fan even claiming mr @entity15 had made his @entity124			0
' the feedback has been resoundingly positive so far , ' mr @entity15 told the @entity126			0
' almost shockingly so , really			0
@entity128 fans might be some of the nicest people on the internet			0

former @entity61 editor created police box out of bottles and wood
then created a @entity51 computer model of the interior based on *series* featuring @entity58 as the doctor
*combined* this with a graphics rendering engine to turn it into a 2d image and smartphone software so it would alter as phone passed over the model
