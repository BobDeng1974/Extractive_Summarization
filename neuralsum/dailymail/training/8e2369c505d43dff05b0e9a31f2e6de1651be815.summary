by @entity0 @entity1 was struck down with @entity2 after consuming too many liquorice allsorts - which gave him an upset stomach a grandfather who got an upset stomach after eating too many of his favourite sweets developed a rare nerve condition that left him paralysed			1
@entity1 was struck down with @entity2 after consuming too many liquorice allsorts - which gave him an upset stomach			1
doctors believe the antibodies he produced to fight the upset stomach caused his body to react badly - and mr @entity1 , from @entity14 , then developed the deadly nerve disease			1
within weeks , he was completely paralysed - and only now , a year later , has he managed to relearn to walk again			1
the 68 - year - old said : ' i ate a whole packet of liquorice allsorts in one sitting - they were always my favourite treat			1
' i ended up having a bit of an upset tummy , and a week later , i was struggling to get out of bed			0
' it ’s been an absolute nightmare			0
i lost three stone in a month and it ’s taken me a year to start walking again			2
' he first noticed something was wrong shortly after eating the sweets when he could n’t turn the ignition in his car			1
' my thumb felt weak but i brushed it off as old age - just as i did when i lost the feeling in my feet			0
' after struggling to get out of bed the following week , his wife @entity40 , 64 , took him to their gp in september 2012			0
his condition deteriorated rapidly as he lost feeling in almost all of his body and he was admitted to hospital while doctors frantically tried to diagnose his mystery illness			1
it was only when a doctor asked him whether he had had been unwell in the previous weeks and he remembered his stomach bug that he realised @entity2 was a possibility			1
as a former nurse , he was aware of the symptoms and knew the seriousness of the situation			0
doctors believe the antibodies mr @entity1 ( with wife @entity40 ) produced to fight the upset stomach caused his body to react badly - triggering the debilitating nerve disease @entity2 usually occurs when antibodies produced by the immune system to fight an infection also start attacking the nervous system			1
although it only affects one in every 40,000 people , sufferers normally lose mobility and spend months in rehabilitation relearning to use their limbs			0
@entity2 ( pronounced @entity74 ) syndrome is a rare but serious condition of the nerves that control the body 's senses and movements			1
it affects about 1,500 people in the @entity82 every year and is slightly more common in men than women			2
it causes the immune system ( the body ’s natural defence against infection and illness ) to attack these nerves , causing them to become inflamed			2
symptoms include a tingly , numb sensation in the arms and legs which can result in a loss of feeling and movement			0
most people who develop it have suffered from a viral or bacterial infection a few weeks before			1
around 80 per cent of people make a full recovery within a few weeks or months , and do not have any further problems such as permanent nerve damage			1
for more information : @entity108 consultant neurologist dr @entity109 is an expert on @entity2 and how it develops			2
he said : ' in 75 per cent of cases of @entity2 there is a history of infection and that can be caused by either bacteria or a virus			1
' we can identify which infection @entity2 developed from in half of all cases , but we do n’t understand it completely and in a large number of cases , the cause of the @entity2 is unclear			1
' there are hundreds and hundreds of infections which are incriminated as triggers although some are more likely than others			0
' @entity131 , director of the @entity2 support charity , @entity133 , said : “ this is a matter of much research and the causes of @entity2 just are n’t always known			2
' however it definitely could have been related to these liquorice allsorts			0
“ but it ’s like all rare illnesses - we need to do more research to help people such as @entity1			2
' after his three month stint in @entity145 , @entity1 left hospital in december still in a wheelchair			2
it was another four months before he could take his first steps unaided thanks to a painful course of physiotherapy and he now tries to walk a mile a day			0
within weeks , mr @entity153 was completely paralysed and it has taken him a year to walk again amazingly , @entity1 has made an almost complete full recovery and has just begun driving again			1
he said : ' although i ’m not the man i was , there ’s no point crying " why me ? "			0
i ’ve just been very unlucky			0
' if you ’d asked me two years ago which , of all the illnesses i could get , which one would scare me most , i would have said gbs			0
' there ’s something about this illness , it ’s so horrible - i really feared it			0
i ’m just so thankful that my family have been there to support me through my recovery			0
' the 68 - year - old said : ' i ate a whole packet of liquorice allsorts in one sitting - they were always my favourite treat			2
but the last year has been a nightmare '			0

@entity1 ate whole *bag* of sweets in one go , upsetting his stomach
doctors believe the antibodies he produced to fight infection may have , in turn , triggered nerve condition @entity2
within weeks , he was paralysed and it has taken a year for him to recover
