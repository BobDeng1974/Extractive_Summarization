think you 're too busy to work out ? perhaps this video will change your mind , as two of the busiest and most important men in the world go for a jog round the @entity8			1
a video has emerged of president @entity10 and @entity11 , his vice-president taking a quick run around the @entity8 , in support of @entity17 's ' @entity16 ' campaign designed to encourage people to get physically healthier and make changes in diet			1
the fourth anniversary of the campaign kicked off on ' @entity23 ' , with @entity17 dancing with giant anthropomorphic vegetables			2
true to her word , a video was posted on the @entity16 site today titled ' the moment you 've been waiting for ' featuring both the leaders taking some brief exercise			2
the video begins with @entity11 entering the presidential office asking ' are you ready ? '			0
the pair pass the presidential pets , the @entity55 water dogs @entity58 and @entity59 , who look on in amazement picking up speed : the duo head outside to start a real sprint , and the proper exercise begins follow the leader : @entity11 lags behind his commander - in - chief the president replies ' let 's do this ' , and the two begin a run around the @entity8 , followed by stretching and drinking a large glass of water each			1
they then promise each other ' same time next week ' before heading back to work			0
as @entity11 catches up , the two begin a more leisurely pace , more jogging than running full clip warm down : the pair stretch , so that they can avoid cramps and muscle aches later in the day you win : @entity11 concedes that @entity17 had him pegged during their mid afternoon run time to hydrate : the two stress the importance of refuelling after exercise with some conveniently placed presidential glasses president @entity17 promises to tell the vice president 's wife that he drank all of the water , so he does n't get in trouble back to work : president @entity17 , satisfied with his day 's workout , heads back to important democratic business in his @entity8 office the @entity16 campaign was started in 2010 by first lady @entity17 , as a campaign to fight childhood and adult obesity , as well as improve the general health of the @entity109 population			1
the scheme focuses on plans of diet and exercise , promoting healthy eating and regular physical activity			0
it also provides step - by - step plans for those aiming to join in with the campaign , and regularly enlists the help of celebrities			0
first lady @entity17 talks to the kids after they exercised and danced with the @entity123 during a visit to @entity125 in @entity126 , @entity127 first lady @entity17 exercises and dances with trainer @entity130 ( left ) , and an anthropomorphic aubergine ( right ) the first lady 's scheme has been running for four years , and celebrated it 's fourth anniversary on a popular national talk show recently @entity17 joined up with actor and comedian @entity137 to get fans to learn the facts about obesity and how they can fight it			1
the scheme is part of a @entity8 initiative on fighting the condition , hoping to ' bring the @entity109 to a much more healthier norm '			1
the appearance of mr @entity11 and mr @entity10 in the video together is another suggestion that their relationship is back on track			0
in a revealing interview with @entity154 , mr @entity11 , 71 , said his boss assigned him ' every s * * * job in the world ' and was effectively frozen out after announcing his approval of gay marriage before the president			0
‘ when the president asked me what portfolio did i want , i said , “ base it on what you want of me to help you govern … but i want to be the last guy in the room on every major decision … you ’re president , i ’m not , but if it ’s my experience you ’re lookin ’ for , i want to be the last guy to make the case , ” ’ @entity11 said in a lengthy @entity161 went on to admit that @entity17 kept up his end of the bargain for the majority of their dealings , but the article reveals that there has been a definite frost between the two men that has only just begun to thaw now after the 2012 incident .			2
