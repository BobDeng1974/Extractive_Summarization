upper lips do n’t come any stiffer			2
sir @entity2 — libidinous , boozing former jockey , racing driver , soccer boss and @entity5 ’s belovedly wayward uncle — earned the @entity6 during @entity7 for extraordinary courage under fire			1
but to the end of his life , he refused to brag about it			2
‘ when the @entity14 appeared , one defended oneself , and eventually a gong appeared , ’ he shrugged			2
sir @entity2 earned the @entity6 during @entity7 for extraordinary courage under fire the reality was more dramatic			1
as a captain in the @entity20 , @entity2 , who has died aged 92 , had gone from being a staff junior to commanding officer in the space of three days in 1943			1
@entity26 ’s @entity25 , the @entity27 , were being battered under waves of attack from @entity31 ’s @entity30			2
with a unit of hand - picked men one night , @entity2 fought his way into @entity36 - occupied ground — to retrieve the body of a fellow officer , and ensure the man got the burial he deserved			1
it was an act of loyal friendship and defiance that typified his character			2
the @entity46 - educated son of a baronet could be a roistering , womanising hellraiser			1
but he was also a man to be trusted , as @entity50 was to discover 40 years later when he helped her to defeat the unions			1
he was a household name in the @entity53 , as chairman of @entity55 when the club won the @entity57 and the @entity58			1
he famously banned @entity60 supporters from the club ’s terraces , after a riot during a friendly match against @entity65			2
sir @entity2 ( pictured ) , uncle of prime minister @entity5 , has died aged 92 but he ’s best known now as the incorrigible uncle who helped mould the character of the prime minister — teaching a young @entity5 how to shoot rabbits in the @entity70 fields on a misty saturday morning and then wolf down a meat pie watching @entity55 play in the afternoon			1
after @entity2 married their aunt @entity74 in 1967 , the future pm and his older brother , @entity73 , began to spend weekends at the family seat , the 350 - year - old @entity78 , east of @entity79			1
‘ they were both very bright cookies , ’ the @entity81 ’ uncle recalled proudly			2
‘ and they were both into shooting and football , which i could provide			2
' when we went to the @entity55 , they did it in style			1
we sat up in the gods in the vip bit , and went down to the dressing - room afterwards			1
’ it was not a typical boys ’ match day			2
but then , sir @entity2 was not a typical uncle			1
he was born @entity99 in 1922 at @entity100 , a restoration - era country mansion			1
as a pupil at @entity46 he was frequently ‘ whacked ’			1
‘ and it has n’t done me any harm , but then i ’ve always had a well - upholstered rear end , ’ he joked years later			1
despite his rebellious streak , he could knuckle down at exam time and earned a place at @entity109 , @entity110			2
the incentive was not so much academic as alcoholic : his great ambition was to don the sky - blue bow tie and navy tailcoat of the @entity116			1
@entity5 claims his own involvement with the all - male drinking society is a source of embarrassment			1
his uncle , on the other hand , was proud of it , and said every night at @entity110 was a party , with black - market sherry and claret to fuel their antics			1
away from the @entity116 , he ended up ‘ paralytically drunk ’ with contemporaries including future @entity130 pm @entity129 and @entity132 chancellor @entity131			2
but he had strong political views , and despised the pro-communist attitude of fellow students such as @entity136 and @entity137 , both future labour cabinet ministers			2
when @entity136 and @entity140 joined a march in support of @entity144 ’s invasion of @entity145 in 1940 , @entity2 and his pals sabotaged it by hurling soot bombs and buckets of water			1
unfortunately , their aim was wayward , and a police sergeant was coated			2
they spent the night in the cells , and were released only when they agreed to pay for a replacement uniform			0
@entity5 claims his involvement with the all - male drinking society the @entity116 is a source of embarrassment - but his beloved uncle was proud of it and said every night at @entity110 was a party in 1943 , aged 21 , he had a brusque phone call from his mother @entity164 — ‘ a rather gung - ho sort of lady ’			1
she suggested his time would be better employed fighting @entity14 , and so he enlisted			0
his service with the guards took him across @entity171 and into @entity172 , landing during the bitter fighting in @entity174 in 1944			0
as the @entity175 advanced , he discovered the excitement of wartime liaisons			0
‘ danger enhances the libido , ’ he would declare with a raffish grin			0
‘ so the more frightened you are , the randier you get			0
’ in @entity183 , he would go to 8am mass on sundays — it was the best ‘ hunting ground ’ to meet lonely @entity172 women whose husbands had been killed or captured			0
his autobiography settling @entity189 , published in 2011 , describes how at the end of the war he drove north and saw the bodies of deposed dictator @entity193 and his mistress , @entity195 , strung up from the roof of a petrol station			0
weeks later , he was standing guard over war criminals at the @entity200 , before returning to @entity26 and studying to be a solicitor			0
the legal life could not satisfy his need for adventure , though , and he decided instead to train as a jockey — and compete in the @entity206			0
though he was 6ft 1in , he pared down his weight to just over 10st , with relentless dieting and a regime of @entity211 laxatives			0
he achieved his ambition , riding in the @entity213 , though he was thrown just before @entity214			0
after that he took to motor racing			0
but his obsession with speed was n’t confined to the track : in his @entity221 sports car , he would try to beat his record time driving between @entity222 and @entity79 — 101 miles in an hour and ten minutes			0
as a child , his ambition had been to run the country , and he was picked as a @entity130 candidate for the 1959 general election			0
but his wife @entity228 , with whom he had four children , became ill with an ovarian cyst and died aged just 36			0
he abandoned his political dreams , and became lost in grief , drinking hard and relying on the children ’s nanny to hold the household together			0
‘ being a man , ’ he said , ‘ whisky helped			1
’ it was a sexual fling that snapped him out of it			0
filling up his car on the @entity241 , he chatted up the petrol pump attendant			0
‘ we went back to her bedsit and she was brisk			0
she told me to stop moaning and get on with it			0
’ he did n’t leave her flat for two days			0
when he got home , the nanny was furious — but the crisis was over			0
after several wild years in the @entity252 , with aviation his new obsession , he met and married @entity255 , a distant cousin of the @entity256 and the aunt of the @entity5 boys			1
he gradually became a pillar of the @entity260 — chairman of @entity262 , high sheriff of the county and chief disciplinary steward of the @entity266			1
after several wild years in the @entity252 sir @entity2 met and married @entity255 ( pictured right ) a distant cousin of the @entity256 and the aunt of the @entity5 boys but it was on the board of @entity55 that he really made his mark			1
in 1974 , he backed the appointment of manager @entity272 who went on to win a shelf of silverware , including the @entity57 trophy in 1981			0
the team went on to win a shelf of silverware , including victory over @entity280 in the 1982 @entity58 final			0
but the following year @entity282 fought his way back in , and @entity2 was dismissed			1
his old rival sent him a silk tie emblazoned with the initials @entity286 : ‘ @entity287 ’			0
instead of dwelling on traumas , his golden rule was to treat life like a ritzy but unreliable hotel : ‘ if your breakfast does n’t arrive , instead of walking out in a flounce , you should look around for a chicken leg			0
’ his chicken leg this time was served up by @entity50			1
with the unions rampant , demanding a 15 per cent pay rise and threatening a national strike , he became chairman of @entity302 and used all his charm and doggedness to settle the dispute			1
plenty of whisky on the negotiating table helped keep the talks flowing , he noted			2
and his humour helped : at one meeting , he wore a plastic carnation in his buttonhole , with a silk - stockinged leg in the centre that did the can - can every ten minutes			1
to the end of his life , he invited controversy			0
at the launch of his book , he set out his political philosophy : however much the @entity132 sought to deny it , the working classes wanted to be led by an aristocrat ... preferably a duke			0
if that was n’t exactly what @entity5 wanted to hear from his wayward uncle , sir @entity2 did n’t care			1
he never cared who he offended .			0

sir @entity2 was *awarded* the @entity6 during @entity7
@entity46 - educated son of a baronet could be womanising hellraiser
but he was also a man to be trusted , as @entity50 was to discover 40 years later when he helped her to defeat the unions
sir @entity2 is best known as the former chairman of @entity55 - where he would take a young @entity5 to watch matches
