by @entity0 around @entity1 lurks a bizarre moon named @entity3			1
it ’s odd , not just because one side of the planet is light and the other dark , but also because it has a giant ridge running across it			0
until now astronomers were n’t sure how this ridge came to be on the moon , but a new study suggests it may have fallen there – from the sky			1
did this ridge fall from space ? new research suggests a the huge mountainous range ( pictured by @entity18 ) on the @entity19 may have dropped from the sky the team of researchers that made the discovery are from @entity24 in @entity25 and the @entity26 in @entity27			1
in their paper they suggest that the mountainous ridge , which runs around the equator of the moon , most likely was not created on the surface			1
instead they say it is of exogenic origin , meaning it came from an external source , which may have been a ring system around the moon			0
ring systems around moons are almost non-existent , which would make this discovery very interesting			0
discovery : 25 october 1671 distance from @entity1 : 2.2 million miles ( 3.5 million kilometres ) time taken to orbit @entity1 : 79.3 @entity45 days radius : 450 miles ( 735 kilometres ) speed needed to leave the surface : 1,280 miles ( 2,000 kilometres ) per hour it has been thought that moons are unable to have their own ring system as the gravity of their host planet is too invasive			1
only one moon is known of that may have a ring system : @entity57 , another of @entity1 ’s moons , which orbits far enough away to have such a system			1
but if it is discovered that @entity3 , too , once had a ring system it could change our understanding of how moons can thrive in their orbits			1
the latest theory was based on 3d models of the moon , from which the researchers analysed the types of peaks on the ridge			0
@entity3 is one of @entity1 's 62 moons ( 53 confirmed , nine potential moons ) and orbits quite far out when compared to the others			1
@entity77 dominates the moons though and is much larger than all the rest combined @entity3 is unusual because one side is much brighter than the other			2
the darker surface can be seen starting on the right			0
the bright hemisphere is the trailing hemisphere in the moon 's orbit the ridge is 12 miles ( 19 km ) high by 12 miles wide and stretches 800 miles ( 1,300 km ) around @entity3			1
the 3d model was created using data from the @entity18 , which has been operating in the @entity1 system since it arrived in july 2004			2
the team found most of the peaks sat at their angle of repose , which is the maximum angle that material can rest on a peak without falling to the bottom			0
normal geological activity forms shallow peaks with less uniformity , which suggests the mountains were not created via such means but rather were part of a ring of material that once circled the moon			1
this ring could have been created by a collision of another body with the moon , or by two bodies colliding nearby			2
the resultant material from the impact would have coalesced around the equator of the moon			0
over time this ring could have been dragged to the surface by the moon ’s gravity			2
supporting this theory , according to the team , is the irregular orbit of @entity3 and the fact it is tidally locked , which means the same face always points towards @entity1			2
further research will be needed , though , to truly determine if the intriguing theory is correct			0
the @entity18 spacecraft has been in orbit around @entity1 since july 2004			0
during its mission it has observed many of the moons and also released a lander , @entity134 , onto the surface of @entity77 on christmas day 2004			0

new research suggests a mountainous ridge on @entity3 came from the sky
astronomers say normal geologic activity could not have made the feature
instead it is *believed* the @entity1 moon once had a ring around it
over time this ring fell to the surface of @entity3 and created the vast ridge
@entity3 is a strange two - toned world and is one of @entity1 's 62 moons
