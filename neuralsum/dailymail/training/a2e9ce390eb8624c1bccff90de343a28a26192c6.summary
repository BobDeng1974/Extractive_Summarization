a hard - partying @entity1 woman who was shocked to find a $ 362 @entity3 cab fare after a night of drinking has managed to recoup her loss - and then some - with crowd funding @entity7 used the online cab service to get home after her 26th birthday party on halloween friday night			1

' i feel taken advantage of and cheated by the @entity3 name			1
$ 367 for a 20 minute ride should never be justified , even on @entity11 , ' she wrote			2
within 12 hours , miss @entity7 was able to raise nearly $ 600 from sympathetic donors - enough to cover the bill and pay for another big night out			1

as many commentators on her page pointed out , even highly intoxicated , she should have known the cab ride would have been expensive			0

@entity7 was stunned when she checked her receipts for the ride
she found that @entity3 had charged her nine times more than usual
but she turned to a ‘ *crowdfunding* ’ *website* to raise the money back
she said that the charge left her unable to pay her rent of $ 450
@entity3 have not offered to rectify the charge for the cash - *strapped* woman
