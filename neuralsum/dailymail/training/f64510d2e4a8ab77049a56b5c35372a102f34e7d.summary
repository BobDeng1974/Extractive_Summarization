a variation on a virtual kidnapping scam that targeted immigrant families is now being tried against affluent parents in @entity4 and @entity5			2
dr @entity6 , a dentist from @entity7 , @entity5 , told @entity8 of receiving a phone call from a man claiming to be a @entity12 cartel member who kidnapped his daughter			1
in a call like this , the gang member threatens to cut off the child 's fingers and slit their throat unless they receive a cash ransom			2
scared : a dramatization shows dr @entity6 receiving a call from supposed kidnappers who say they have his daughter the next voice that is heard is that of a child crying , ' i do n't know where i am			1
' in all likelihood , though , these families ' children safe and sound , and the voice on the other line belongs to a stranger			0
after he overcame the initial shock , @entity35 realized the voice of the girl crying on the other line was not his daughter and hung up on the hoaxer			1
some have not been so quick , as the @entity42 in @entity43 say a dentist was taken for more than $ 1,000 recently , with another physician in @entity46 losing over $ 2,000			0
red flags can signal the caller is not who they say they are			0
the @entity42 says calls come from a different area code and never from the victim 's cell phone , and that scammers only take wire transfers			2
' virtual kidnappings ' have their roots in @entity12 , where scammers were able to play off the fear and paranoia caused by actual kidnappings taking place at the hands of cartels and corrupt police			1
shocked : after overcoming the first few seconds of fear , dr @entity6 realized the call was fake when he did not recognize the girl 's voice on the other line one investigation that led to arrests and criminal charges actually began as a real kidnapping , when a @entity78 woman paid a $ 2,500 ransom to free her brother - in - law who had been abducted in @entity81			1
@entity82 reports that after he had been freed , the kidnappers tried to go back to the well for more , and the woman reported the call knowing her brother - in - law was already safe			0
police arrested a married couple at a @entity89 who were involved in the scheme , and later arrested four others for a scam that earned $ 500,000			1
in another variation in @entity96 , scammers told the families of @entity99 immigrants that their relatives had been kidnapped while crossing the border			0
officials told the @entity103 that currently ' there is nothing to indicate ' that the scams are tied to actual cartel activity .			0

dr @entity6 of @entity7 , @entity5 , received a phone call from a supposed @entity12 cartel member claiming he had kidnapped his daughter
@entity35 hung up after he heard the voice of the little girl and *determined* it was n't his daughter
scammers make thousands of calls a *day* and hope that a person 's fear will overcome their *rational* thinking
one hoax ring working in @entity123 and @entity12 *netted* $ 500,000 before being *busted* by @entity78 police
