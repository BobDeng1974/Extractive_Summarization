by @entity0 published : 07:22 est , 29 may 2012 updated : 08:03 est , 29 may 2012 a mother desperate to save the lives of her unborn twins lay in a hospital bed for five months			1
@entity5 , 31 , was under strict doctors ' orders not to leave her bed , not even to wash or grab some food - but with horrendous consequences			1
confined to a bed in @entity12 in @entity13 for 24 hours a day , she spent so long lying down that her muscles wasted , her legs became too weak to walk on and she broke out in red hives after suffering from a rare skin condition			1
determined : @entity5 was so desperate to save the lives of her then - unborn twins @entity19 ( left ) and @entity20 that she lay in a hospital bed for five months waiting game : miss @entity5 spent so long lying down in @entity12 that her muscles wasted and her legs became too weak to walk on it had taken @entity24 three cycles of @entity26 to become pregnant , so when doctors told her that her thin cervix made her likely to miscarry , she begged them for something to help			1
surgery was pointless , she learned – her only hope was lying down permanently until the babies were strong enough for birth after 24 weeks			1
so miss @entity5 was confined to hospital			1
now , cradling twins @entity20 and @entity19 , the proud mother says it was worth every single minute			1
she said : ' i went for a routine scan in august and did n’t leave hospital until december			0
' most people hate spending any time in hospital and ca n’t believe it when i tell them i was in for nearly half a year			1
' but as a mother , you will do anything to protect your babies			0
i ’m just thrilled that it worked			0
' miss @entity5 ’s journey began when her gp referred her to a specialist for tests to find out why she and her partner , financial planner @entity53 , 40 , were unable to conceive			1
in 2008 , she was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries and began fertility treatment soon after			0
but doctors also discovered that miss @entity5 's cervix was fused closed , which explained why she had been unable to get pregnant			1
they suspected laser treatment she ’d had in her early twenties to remove abnormal cells had caused a build - up of scar tissue			2
rash : the 31 - year - old broke out in red hives after suffering from rare skin condition @entity67 taking it easy : a cheerful miss @entity5 whiles away another day in bed doctors tried to surgically open it in 2009 and 2010 but were unsuccessful			1
they told @entity24 that her only hope of motherhood was ivf			1
she and mr @entity53 were given @entity77 funding but their first two attempts , in october 2010 and february 2011 , were unsuccessful			0
during their next attempt , in april 2011 , doctors implanted two eggs and when miss @entity5 carried out a home pregnancy test days later , the line turned dark blue			1
she said : ' it was n’t a faint line , it was really heavy			0
i thought it could be twins			2
' a scan confirmed that she was correct			0
but concerns over her cervix meant miss @entity5 ’s pregnancy was closely monitored from the start and – just five weeks later – alarm bells started ringing			1
she said : ' a scan showed my cervix had thinned to 20mm , which was half what it was actually supposed to be			2
' the doctors did n’t think it was strong enough to be able to support my babies ’ weight and i was told i was at a high risk of miscarriage			1
' another scan at 15 weeks revealed her cervix had thinned even further , and miss @entity5 was signed off work to rest			1
three weeks later , her mother took her for a special scan where they were able to see the twins in @entity119			2
miss @entity5 said : ' it was incredible but then they dropped the bombshell that despite me resting , my cervix was even thinner			1
' basically , i was told that if things progressed in the same way , then i would probably lose my babies			2
' before and after : it had taken @entity24 three cycles of @entity26 to become pregnant and then doctors told her that her thin cervix made her likely to miscarry special care unit : after the twins were delivered by @entity132 , baby @entity19 spent three days in intensive care a consultant at the @entity12 told @entity24 the only hope of keeping her babies in the womb long enough to have any chance of surviving was not through hi - tech surgery or modern medicine but by , quite literally , putting her feet up			1
miss @entity5 said : ' i was shocked , especially when they said they were admitting me immediately			1
' it was august last year when @entity5 was wheeled to a bed in the corner of the maternity unit			1
she would not leave until december			0
' it was overwhelming , ' she said			0
' at first , i set short goals , like making it through the first week			0
' she was told to lie as flat as possible			2
washing , eating , reading and watching television would all have to be done lying down			0
she was not to leave her bed for anything other than toilet breaks - and those were only allowed because her bed was two steps from the cubicle			2
as the weeks passed , miss @entity5 became used to the hospital routine			1
the curtains around her bed swished open each morning when nurses did their first rounds			2
as time went by , staff even began to recognise her choices on the hospital menu			2
she learned the names of all the nurses and cleaning staff and spent her time reading up on baby development			2
the days could be mind - numbingly boring , but worse was the knowledge that it might all be for nothing			0
she said : ' i knew my babies were in grave danger			0
they expected me to go into premature labour and i knew that if i did before 23 weeks they would n’t have a chance			0
' as summer turned to autumn , then to winter , miss @entity5 stayed in the same bed , staring up at the hospital ceiling , counting the hours go by			1
she said : ' i was literally ticking off the days as i imagine a prisoner would do in jail			0
' her first big goal was to get her babies to 24 weeks – the age when they would be entitled to medical care should they arrive early			0
but a 20 - week scan showed her cervix was now just 8mm thick			2
miss @entity5 was told that , due to her weak cervix , the only hope of keeping her babies in the womb long enough to have any chance of surviving was to lie in bed for months proud parents : miss @entity5 and her partner @entity53 hold their precious twins ' i was too scared to cough or sneeze , let alone stand up , ' she said			1
' i just prayed we would get to 24 weeks			0
' the milestone came and went – and to everyone ’s relief there was still no sign of the babies			0
at 28 weeks , @entity5 was allowed a short trip out of the ward for a tour of the special baby care unit where her twins were likely to be treated			1
she said : ' doctors felt sure they would arrive any day so they wanted me to be familiar with the unit			0
' but i ’d been in bed so long that i could hardly stand , because the muscles on my legs had wasted away			1
' when i tried to walk , i fainted			0
so @entity53 took me in a wheelchair but even that was exhausting for me			0
' then i began bleeding and having contractions , so i was advised not to try walking again			0
' at 32 weeks , miss @entity5 was advised to start practising standing and taking steps			1
at first every step she took was a trial			0
at 34 weeks , medics agreed she was at last out of the danger zone and she was finally allowed home to wait for her twins to arrive			2
but one week later , she developed the dangerous pregnancy condition pre-eclampsia and was told the twins needed to be delivered			2
and on january 3 , her babies were delivered by caesarean section			0
daughter @entity20 was placed in miss @entity5 ’s arms but , due to delivery complications , son @entity19 was rushed to a special care unit			1
it was three days before he was well enough to join his mother and sister on the ward			0
now the four - month - old twins are thriving			2
apart from having physiotherapy to help back pain following her long stint in bed , miss @entity5 has returned to full health			1
but she has no regrets			0
she said : ' when you know your babies ’ lives are on the line , being in hospital for that long is easier than you think			0
at times i feared i would n’t be a mum			0
now i have the perfect family			0

@entity5 was told her thin cervix made her likely to miscarry
doctors told the 31 - year - old that her only hope was to stay in bed
she spent five months at @entity12 during which time her muscles wasted away and she broke out in red hives
miss @entity5 finally gave birth to twins @entity19 and @entity5
