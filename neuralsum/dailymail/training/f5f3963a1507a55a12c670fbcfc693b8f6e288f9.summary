@entity2 's winters are getting colder because of melting @entity4 ice changing global weather patterns , the @entity0 has claimed			1
forecasters are concerned that high levels of ice melt in the @entity9 in recent years could be behind @entity2 ’s increasingly bitter and longer winters			2
the organisation ’s leading climate change expert , dr @entity13 , is to convene experts from around the world to establish whether this explains why @entity2 has been experiencing the coldest temperatures for almost 100 years			1
springtime in @entity19 : april snow showers in @entity21 come amid @entity0 claims that high levels of ice melt in the @entity9 in recent years could be responsible for @entity2 's bitter winters jet streams are belts of fast flowing air found in the atmosphere which are formed near air masses with significantly different temperatures			1
they are responsible for moving weather around the latitudes			0
the polar jet stream affects the @entity2 , and tends to be further south in the winter and further north in the summer			0
recently , the jet stream has been further south - which is why the @entity2 has experienced wet summers			0
this winter , the jet stream split in two - part of the belt was at the bottom of the @entity42 , and the other part was sitting at the north of the @entity2			0
a band of high pressure blocked its path meaning the cold weather conditions stuck			0
figures released yesterday revealed that the temperature in @entity51 fell to -11.2 degrees @entity52 on april 2 – this is the lowest recorded april temperature for almost 100 years			1
the news comes just after it was revealed that @entity2 also experienced the coldest march since 1962			0
dr @entity13 is concerned that shrinking sea ice in the @entity9 could be responsible			1
‘ if this is how climate change could manifest itself , then we need to understand that as a matter of urgency , ’ she told @entity57			2
there are a number of theories as to how melting @entity9 ice could affect @entity2 weather			1
one view is that the warming of the @entity9 has the effect of reducing the jet stream – the fast - moving river of warm air which controls our weather patterns – and that this could cause @entity2 to be subjected to longer periods of unmoving weather , such as the cold weather that has recently affected the country			2
this winter , the jet stream split in two - part of the belt was at the bottom of the @entity42 , and the other part was sitting at the north of the @entity2			0
this caused the prolonged period of very cold weather if the @entity9 experiences rapid ice melt then a large amount of very cold water is released into the ocean			2
this cold water can disrupt the normal path of the jet stream which usually keeps @entity2 much warmer than its latitude suggests it should be			0
as a result , we can be subjected to much colder weather than normal			0
dr @entity100 , a research professor at the @entity101 , told @entity57 that the @entity2 's geographical position makes it particularly vulnerable to changes in the @entity9			1
the @entity0 is organising an urgent meeting of climate change experts to discuss whether melting @entity9 ice is changing @entity2 's weather @entity2 experienced the coldest march since 1962 with temperatures across the country failing to reach average figures			1

dr @entity13 at the @entity0 calling a meeting of world climate experts
she is concerned melting @entity9 ice is causing @entity2 's climate to change
comes after lowest april temperature for nearly 100 years was recorded
