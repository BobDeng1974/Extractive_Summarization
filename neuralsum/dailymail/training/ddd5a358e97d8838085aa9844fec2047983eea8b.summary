by @entity0 one of the theories for how life began on @entity3 is something known as panspermia			0
this says that life was first carried to @entity3 in microbial form by an asteroid or comet that originated from a planet in our solar system such as @entity14 , or even one outside it			0
but could the opposite be possible ? could we send our own life into the universe to ‘ seed ’ other worlds ? that ’s what some researchers have discussed - and they say it ’s feasible			0
scientists have suggested that our best bet of colonising the galaxy might be to send human genomes throughout the cosmos ( arist 's illustration shown ) in the hope they seed life on a planet			2
the radical proposal was made at a talk for the @entity37 in @entity38 recently in a talk at the @entity37 ’s ‘ the future is @entity44 ’ in @entity38 in may , @entity40 engineer @entity39 spoke about the future of space exploration			1
the 100 - year @entity46 is a joint endeavour run by @entity48 , @entity40 , @entity49 and the @entity50			1
through the project @entity48 has previously suggested that ' printing ' humans on distant planets , like the proposal suggested here by @entity39 , is a possibility for colonising the @entity59 galaxy			1
announced in january 2012 , the project has an overall goal of achieving manned interstellar travel by 2112			1
to do so it is evaluating a number of different techonolgies , including ‘ warping ’ space time to travel great distances in short time frames at faster - than - light speeds			2
the project is also considering building ‘ generation ships ’ that move slowly but have a self - sustainable long - term population			0
to date @entity40 has contributed $ 100,000 ( £ 60,000 ) to the project and @entity48 $ 1 million ( £ 600,000 )			1
and aside from reiterating the importance that we continue manned exploration , he spoke of a lesser - known method of space exploration – sending the human genome to far - flung planets			1
his somewhat radical proposal , building on work by other researchers , would see humans launched as bacteria to distant planets before being ‘ printed ’ by methods unknown , perhaps a machine , according to a report written by @entity92 for @entity93			1
‘ our best bet for space exploration could be printing humans , organically , on another planet , ’ he said			2
‘ maybe we will colonize other worlds not with astronauts in space suits , but with bacteria , ’ @entity39 continued			0
‘ those considerations seem beautiful , fantastic			0
’ the idea was first dreamed up by @entity104 biologists dr @entity105 and dr @entity106 , as reported in a @entity108 release			0
they suggest that fractions of the human genome could be sent to distant worlds in bacteria			1
upon arrival , the various segments would then be reassembled into a human genome			1
in fact , in a paper from april 2012 , scientists from @entity118 in @entity119 discussed how so - called ‘ reverse panspermia ’ might have already happened - albeit by accident			0
they say previous impacts could have sent life - bearing meteorites from @entity3 to other planets			2
the @entity128 crater event , for example , which is thought to have ended the time of the dinosaurs , might have been sufficient to send @entity3 - based life to other planets in the solar system			2
‘ if life forms inside remain viable , this would be evidence of life from @entity3 seeding other planets , ’ they wrote			2
the proposal would be based around one of two methods			0
either bacteria carrying the human genome ( strand of dna pictured ) would be sent to ' infect ' distant planets and evolve , or a robot would be sent thousands of years in advance and then tasked with printing humans from beamed information planets such as @entity153 ( artist 's illustration shown ) , which was announced in april , provide tantalising hints of habitable worlds outside our solar system			1
this particular planet is the most @entity3 - like found to date , orbiting its star in the middle of its habitable zone where liquid water and possibly life could thrive quite how these bacteria would grow into humans is up for debate			0
they could simply be left to evolve , as life did on @entity3 , seeding another planet with our own organisms			1
alternatively , an autonomous machine capable of creating cellular life could be sent thousands of years in advance to a habitable exoplanet outside the solar system			2
upon arrival , information on how to genetically construct a human would be beamed to the machine			1
of course , these proposals are something that will only be possible for humans hundreds , or perhaps thousands , of years in the future			0
but many scientists are of the belief that we will one day be able to create multicellular life - and it stands to reason this could include an organism as complex as a human			0
the theory might sound unlikely but it 's not entirely without precedent			0
in may the @entity198 ( @entity198 ) , attached to the exterior of the @entity201 module on the @entity202 , proved that bacteria could survive an interplanetary trip from @entity3 to @entity14 , suggesting a journey even further could be possible the proposal also overcomes a well known problem of interstellar travel - namely , travelling to a distant planet in a human lifetime is impossible based on our current knowledge of the laws of physics			1
without a form of travel that can ‘ cheat ’ when travelling large distances , such as a wormhole that jumps through space - time , interstellar travel just is n’t a realistic proposition			1
so , perhaps to colonise other worlds our best bet is simply to send the ingredients for humanity and let nature take its course			0
whether we ’d then be able to communicate with these distant humans , or if they ’d know we exist , is another consideration altogether			2
if the idea sounds like purely science fiction rather than science fact , it might seem less so when a recent experiment on the @entity202 is taken into account			0
in may the @entity198 ( @entity198 ) , attached to the exterior of the @entity201 module , proved that bacteria could survive an interplanetary trip from @entity3 to @entity14			0
for an interstellar trip they would need more protection in order to survive the long travel time			1
but one day down the line , perhaps our descendants will decide that throwing bits of human genome into the cosmos in the hope it sticks on a distant planet is our best bet of colonising the galaxy .			1

a @entity40 expert has joined others in saying we could launch dna to planets
sending *fragments* of the human genome might allow *people* to be ' printed '
could solve the problem of how humans can survive interstellar travel
the genome segments would be left to evolve on a distant exoplanet
or information on how to ' print ' a human could be sent to a machine
