a woman has become an internet sensation after appearing in a series of hilarious poses on @entity4 selling her deliberately ' ugly ' @entity6 jumpers			1
@entity7 , 45 , from @entity8 in @entity9 , spends hours painstakingly turning second - hand sweaters into ' hideous ' festive creations by sewing on tinsel , bells and even cuddly toys			1
and whenever the mother - of - three updates her @entity4 store ' @entity15 ' she poses in the new addition			1
indeed , so popular has ms @entity7 become , she is now toying with setting up her own ugly jumper factory in order to meet demand			1
ms @entity7 , who first hit upon the idea of flogging awful @entity6 jumpers last year , said : ' @entity38 ' parties every @entity6			1
" i 've always been quite creative , so one year i thought i 'd give it a go and everybody said mine was the tackiest - it was quite a compliment			0
' some people and businesses even have competitions to find the most tasteless jumpers , which is why i think my creations are so popular			2
' i know it 's a cheating a bit if someone wins by wearing one of my creations , but i do n't mind - i like knowing i 'm the best at making something so ugly			2
' ms @entity7 sells her hideous creations for up to Â£ 50 , and is struggling to keep up with orders because she can only make two in an evening			1
toned down : not every jumper is festooned with tinsel - this red number is relatively toned down and stylish ' i go through thrift stores and charity shops , as well as boot sales and craft fairs , just to get as much festive rubbish as possible to sew onto the jumpers , ' she explains			0
" last year someone saw one of my jumpers and asked where they could buy one			0
it was a lightbulb moment - i could n't believe anybody would actually pay for them , so i started making them as fast as i could			0
' i sold about 30 for christmas 2013 , but i had supply issues because i did n't really know where to go to get the raw @entity78 i know where to get them from , so i can make a couple every night			0
' i 've probably made about 200 jumpers this year so far , and i 've got another couple of hundred orders to get made before @entity6			1
' she added : ' @entity86 has his elves , and i 'm seriously considering opening my own factory			2
' all the trimmings : ms @entity7 scours thrift stores for old bits of tinsel and baubles to use for decoration unique : each jumper is handmade and totally unique			2
ms @entity7 also takes commissions busy : so popular have ms @entity7 's quirky designs proved , she is even contemplating setting up a factory massive teddy bears , penguins , moose , polar bears and even a @entity6 monkey are among the most popular designs - even if they are , as ms @entity7 admits , in questionable taste			1
' i just try and come up with something that 's themed , even if the theme is ' ugly , ' she explained			0
' they 're quite clearly not in the best taste , but they certainly serve a purpose , and also nobody can see them and not get in the mood for @entity6			2
' the budding designer also opened up about her signature pose , which involves wide eyes and a toothy grimace - like smile , while standing with her arms by her sides and clenched fists pointing at the ground			0
' i do n't pose like that because i have a gun pointed at me , that 's for sure , ' she revealed			0
' i stand like that so people can see the detail on the arms			0
' i am purposely smiling big and making my eyes look crazy because these are crazy sweaters			0
i 'm not terrified , i promise			0
' ms @entity7 , who is willing to ship her incredibly hideous jumpers all over the world , also does commissions , and has even made a sweater for an @entity137 girl that is covered in skunks			1
signature : all of ms @entity7 's designs are sold on @entity4 and she models the jumpers on every listing herself terrified : ms @entity7 has developed a signature pose , complete with wide - eyes and a rigid stance			1
