a study found the risk of alcohol - related hypertension , or high blood pressure , was greater in people who develop a warm glow after drinking			1
the risk was significantly increased when ‘ flushers ’ consumed more than four drinks per week			2
people who turn red - faced when they drink ( right ) are less able to tolerate alcohol and need to watch their blood pressure , new research has shown			1
if they drink more than four alcoholic drinks a week they are at increased risk of high blood pressure the rosy - cheeked , often portly , drinker has long been a figure of fun and one of the cartoonist 's favourite characters			1
but the new research from @entity27 suggests that flushing red after a drink is no joke			0
high blood pressure , including alcohol - related high blood pressure , is a major cause of heart attacks and strokes because it puts strain on the blood vessels			1
‘ facial flushing after drinking is always considered as a symptom of high alcohol sensitivity or even intolerance to alcohol , unless a patient is taking special medicine , ’ said lead researcher dr @entity38 , from @entity39			2
‘ the facial flushing response to drinking usually occurs in a person who can not genetically break down acetaldehyde , [ a toxic product of alcohol produced when alcohol is broken down in the liver ]			1
‘ to my knowledge , there has been no detailed research that has analysed the relationship between drinking and hypertension while considering individual responses to alcohol			0
‘ our results indicate that hypertension associated with drinking has a lower threshold value and higher risk in flushers than in non-flushers			0
women and @entity69 are most likely to turn red faced after drinking but the problem can also affect @entity70 and men , such as @entity73 ( pictured ) ‘ after adjusting for age , body mass index , exercise status , and smoking status , the risk of hypertension was significantly increased when flushers consumed more than four drinks per week			1
‘ in contrast , in non-flushers , the risk increased with consuming more than eight drinks per week			0
’ ‘ facial flushing after alcohol drinking differs across gender , age , and ethnic groups , ’ added @entity85 , president of the @entity86			0
‘ in general , it is more common in women , the elderly , and @entity69 versus @entity70			0
’ the team , whose findings appear online in the journal @entity98 : @entity99 , examined the medical records of 1,763 @entity102 men , including 288 non-drinkers , 527 flushing drinkers , and 948 non-flushing drinkers			0
the risk of high blood pressure related to alcohol consumption was compared in flushers and non-flushers			2
facial flushing after drinking may potentially serve as a marker of hypertension risk associated with alcohol , said dr @entity38			2
‘ our research findings suggest that clinicians and researchers should , respectively , consider evaluating their patients ' flushing response to alcohol as well as drinking amount in a daily routine care , and researching hazard by drinking , ’ he added			0
the researchers admit it is not clear why people who turn red when they drink alcohol are at greater risk of high blood pressure .			1

people who turn red when they drink alcohol are less able to break down acetaldehyde - a toxic substance produced when alcohol is *metabolised*
if they consume four or more alcoholic drinks a week they are at a significantly increased risk of developing high blood pressure
people who do *n't* turn red after drinking have an increased risk of high blood pressure if they drink eight or more alcoholic drinks a week
facial flushing after alcohol is most common in women and @entity69
high blood pressure increases stroke and heart attack risk
