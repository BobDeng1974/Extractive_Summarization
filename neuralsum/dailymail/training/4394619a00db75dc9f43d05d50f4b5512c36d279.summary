by @entity0 published : 09:00 est , 19 june 2013 updated : 16:48 est , 19 june 2013 with only days to go before his daredevil wire walk across the @entity3 without a safety harness and live on television , @entity1 has released a stomach churning video of what his daring feat will involve			1
the sky walker is seen walking between two looming buildings in his home town of @entity14 , @entity15 , and fighting to keep his balance as giant fans are directed at him to recreate conditions at the @entity3			0
crowds of spectators have been gathering every day to watch as @entity1 and his team practice for his 1,200ft walk without tethers or safety nets about 1,500ft above the @entity25 on sunday			1
for two weeks , the holder of a half - dozen world records and the only person to walk on a wire over the brink of @entity47 , has been practicing for what will be his biggest feat yet			1
the stunt by the seventh generation member of the famous @entity54 acrobat family is scheduled to be shown live on the @entity55 on june 23			2
@entity1 and his team have been trying to recreate the conditions he is likely to over the @entity3			2
trying conditions : @entity1 and his team use giant fans to recreate the wind speeds he is likely to encounter one step at a time : the wire cable will stretch 1,200ft across part of the @entity3 preparations : @entity1 walks on a practice wire with the @entity3 as his back drop , as he trains for the stunt although the humid @entity15 heat is helping him adjust to the temperatures he is expecting , the unpredictable winds that whip through the @entity3 have been challenging			1
to try to get a feel for dealing with them , @entity1 practiced walking on his wire cable as @entity75 battered the @entity76			2
his team also used air boats to create winds reaching 91mph as @entity1 walked on his hire wire			2
' i 'm not scared of them , ' he told the @entity83 , as he walked gracefully across his wire in the specially made moccasins his mother created for him			0
@entity87 : @entity1 walks on top of the ferris wheel at @entity90 broadwalk in 2011 dream : the member of the @entity54 act achieved his childhood wish of crossing @entity47 last year stunt : @entity1 crosses a wire to entertain crowds at the @entity99 spring cup series in @entity100 ' i have to respect it , but i would never do what i do if i was scared , ' he said			1
@entity1 , who has dreamed of doing a wire walk across the @entity3 for years , says his act is made possible by good mental concentration and positive thinking			1
' once i get on that wire i get very peaceful ... i look down and look at my surroundings , i hear crowds , i hear people in the audience			0
' since his first wire walk at the age of four , @entity1 he has been stung by a bee and had birds land on his balancing pole			1
his first experience on a wire came before he was even born , when his mother performed a sky walk while six months pregnant			2
in the final moments before starting one of his walks , he prays , then hugs his wife and three children , telling them he will see them in a few minutes			0
' the first couple of steps are the hardest , so there 's a lot of anticipation , ' @entity1 , who proposed to his wife @entity129 as they performed 30ft above crowds in @entity132 , @entity133 , said			0
legend : @entity140 , @entity1 's great grandfather and source of inspiration , crosses the @entity143 in 1970 family act : @entity1 and his sister @entity145 learned to sky walk from a young age he added : ' the hard part about doing live tv is waiting till the director says go			1
' the wire walker , who has written about his feats in his book @entity155 , uses a specially made cable , more often used for ocean dredging to perform his feats			0
his balance pole , which weights 43lb , is a vital piece of equipment , increasing his center of gravity and making it easier for him to adapt to conditions high above the ground			0
despite his positive thinking and training however , @entity1 is well aware of the dangers of the stunt			2
his great - grandfather and legendary sky walker , @entity140 , fell to his death at the age of 73 , during a hire wire walk in @entity174 in 1978			1
the legendary sky walker has been a source of inspiration for @entity1 , who recalls on his website watching footage of the tragedy when he was four			0
his grandfather 's belief that ' life is on the wire , everything else is just waiting , ' has stayed with @entity1 since childhood , and driven him to perform his amazing hire wire feats			1
focused : @entity1 says when he steps on the wire he feels calm and relaxed - even over a 1,300ft drop the televised sky walk over @entity47 last year was watched by more than 13 million @entity190 on @entity191			1
however , the safety clause in the network 's contract meant @entity1 had to wear a harness			0
' it was my dream to walk over @entity47 since i was about 5 or 6 years old , but part of that dream was taken away because i had to wear that harness , ' he said			0
' the exciting thing about this event is that i will not be wearing any tether or any safety whatsoever			0
' @entity55 will be filming the live stunt on sunday in a remote section of the @entity3 national park , which is run by the @entity208 .			0

@entity1 will perform daredevil high wire walk live on television
