in a few months ’ time , when @entity1 heads out to the @entity2 to start a new career with @entity4 , there is a danger that he will be lost to @entity7 football			1
the @entity8 can not allow that to happen			2
they are already in talks to make him an ambassador for the national team , but it can not end there			2
he still has much to offer			0
at the age of 36 @entity1 will be a star when he moves to @entity4 , just as he is here after a decorated career for club and country			1
@entity1 ( left ) training ahead of @entity25 's @entity24 tie with @entity26 @entity27 was part of @entity30 's management team at the @entity31 while @entity32 is the current @entity33 no 2 - both have the knowledge to become the next national team boss @entity25 ’s midfielder is an intelligent and reasoned guy			1
those qualities have served him well over the years , engaging with fans , media , managers and coaches at @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity25 and @entity33			2
the @entity8 , rightly , have picked up on it			2
he is one of the @entity48 , among a number of players from the @entity52 era who can help to shape the future of the @entity7 game			1
there should be nothing to stop @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , @entity32 , @entity64 , @entity27 , @entity65 , @entity1 , or others becoming the next @entity33 manager			1
throw that lot into a room with some sandwiches and a few pots of coffee for a couple of hours and you would soon hear some of the best ideas in the sport			0
these boys have the knowledge			0
surely they have so much to give after careers that took them to @entity82 quarter - finals against @entity83 ( 2002 ) and @entity84 ( 2006 )			0
even the bad memories , such as the failure to qualify for @entity87 or the 4 - 1 defeat against @entity89 at the @entity31 , can be used to @entity33 ’s advantage			1
it would be foolish not to tap into these resources			0
with the exception of @entity32 ( who already holds the @entity96 ) , if any of those players committed themselves to the idea of becoming @entity33 ’s head coach , there would be a clamour for one of them to be given the job inside five years			1
the younger players would have caught the tail end of their illustrious careers and could still associate with their dressing room mentality			1
the @entity48 would still have their respect			1
if they do n’t want to be in the frame to succeed @entity110 , then there should be opportunities elsewhere within the organisation for some of the most experienced heads in the game			0
@entity61 ( left ) could be another candidate and has shown he has the nous by effectively managing @entity45 here in a crucial @entity24 last 32 match against @entity119 in 2012 in @entity89 , @entity120 was technical director of the national team between 2005 and 2012			2
he has since taken a role as sporting director at @entity124			0
former @entity89 striker @entity125 is the country ’s general manager , a role created during the leadership of @entity129 , another former player			1
@entity130 , who had spells with @entity132 and @entity133 during his playing career , has been coaching @entity89 ’s under - 18 and under - 19 teams since 2011			1
@entity136 , now assistant head coach at @entity137 , was in charge of the @entity140 @entity139 and 17 teams before he returned to work in north @entity142			0
@entity63 ( left ) , @entity64 ( centre ) and @entity144 have coaching experience at @entity146 @entity60 is an excellent @entity147 columnist and @entity149 pundit but could be a good manager it sounds like jobs for the boys , but experience counts at the very highest level			2
it is the right time for the @entity8 to milk it			2
a couple of weeks ago @entity147 ’s @entity157 told a story about an offer he once made to the @entity8 to travel around @entity161 at his own expense to pick up tips from the world ’s best coaches			0
no - one got back to him			0
it seemed like a pretty good offer			0
@entity157 , a former @entity33 international with 43 caps and numerous honours at @entity172 , wanted to be part of the international set up			0
this week the @entity8 have been rather more pro-active by reaching out to two of @entity33 ’s most reasoned and intelligent footballers as part of a strategy to keep former players involved			1
good on them for that			0
former @entity89 striker @entity125 is involved in the country 's set - up as the general manager there are some other ideas kicking around , such as opening an @entity187 or such like at @entity188 to entertain former @entity33 internationals on matchday			1
it seems like a neat idea , an honourable way of remembering past heroes and making sure they still have a part to play with the national team			0
instead of a few ales before kick - off and some stories about the past , far better for these players to be on the fields of @entity202 and working with the next generation of international footballers			0
without them , the likes of @entity1 will become the @entity206 .			1

@entity1 has had talks with the @entity8 to become an @entity33 ambassador
he will move to the @entity2 and @entity4 in a few months
@entity48 could help shape future of @entity7 game
there should be nothing to stop one of them - @entity62 , @entity65 , @entity63 etc - becoming the next @entity33 manager
they would all still have the respect of younger players
@entity89 have done it with players such as @entity125
@entity8 ca *n't* afford for @entity48 to become the @entity206
