by @entity0 it may look like something from the film @entity3 , with a strange snout and rows of terrifying teeth			1
however , in fact this is a catfish believed to only exist in a small part of @entity10			1
the rare creature has baffled scientists , as it appears to be unrelated to every other catfish			2
the fish can move swiftly in its environment , as evidenced by video footage of collected fish darting through water to grab food			2
called @entity16 , the small subterranean catfish has only occasionally been found in springs , wells and flooded rice paddies in the @entity23 mountain region of @entity24 , @entity10			1
it was first described as a new species in 2011			2
soon after that , @entity25 , phd , one of the world ’s leading authorities on catfishes , started taking a closer look at several specimens			1
' the more we looked at the skeleton , the stranger it got , ' said @entity25 of @entity60 , who 's paper was published in the @entity62			0
' the characteristics of this animal are just so different that we have a hard time fitting it into the family tree of catfishes , ' said @entity25			1
from the outside , @entity16 does not look particularly unusual for a catfish			0
but when @entity25 and his colleagues looked at its bones using digital radiography and high - definition cat scans , they found it was missing several bony elements – a characteristic fairly common for subterranean fish			1
researchers likened the fish to the monster from the film alien but there were also changes in the shapes of certain bones , changes so strange that @entity25 described them as ' completely unique among catfishes and all fishes as far as i know			1
' numerous individual bones were modified in the face , giving the fish a compressed front end with a jutting lower jaw – like a bulldog ’s snout , if a bulldog also had four rows of conical , sharp - tipped teeth			1
multiple changes piled up in one part of the body could mean there is a functional purpose for those changes			0
' in dogs that was the result of selective breeding			0
in @entity16 , we do n’t know yet what in their natural evolution would have led to this modified shape , ' @entity25 said			0
the small subterranean catfish sees the light of day and human observers only rarely , when it turns up in springs , wells and flooded rice paddies in the @entity23 mountain region of @entity24 , @entity10			1
@entity16 most likely eats meat , in the form of small invertebrates and insect larvae ¿ whatever might be found in the groundwater and could be captured by the fish , which at less than ten centimeters is smaller than an adult human ¿ s pinkie finger			1
based on its teeth and subterranean home , @entity25 said that @entity16 most likely eats meat , in the form of small invertebrates and insect larvae – whatever might be found in the groundwater and could be captured by the fish , which at less than ten centimeters is smaller than an adult human ’s pinkie finger			1
the fish can move swiftly in its environment , as evidenced by video footage of collected fish darting through water to grab food			0
when @entity25 and his colleagues looked at its bones using digital radiography and high - definition cat scans , they found it was missing several bony elements ¿ a characteristic fairly common for subterranean fish			2
but why @entity16 is so different , and what its closest relatives are , remains a mystery			0
at the same time , a separate team led by @entity163 at the @entity164 of @entity165 independently examined the bone structure of @entity16 using a technique of visualizing the skeleton called clearing and staining – a chemical method in which the fish ’s soft tissues are rendered as clear as glass and bones and cartilage are stained in contrasting colors			0
this team ’s description of the structures was published in the march 2014 issue of the journal @entity183			0
' there was an amazing congruence between the results , ' @entity25 said			0
' neither of us was way out			0
' however , neither could figure out which other catfishes @entity16 was most closely related to , although @entity163 ’s team chose to assign it to its own new taxonomic family within the order of catfishes			2
' it continues to be a puzzle , ' @entity25 said .			0

found in the @entity23 mountain region of @entity24 , @entity10
described as ' completely unique among catfishes and all fishes '
has a snout ' like a bulldogs '
