by @entity0 there are few summer @entity3 champions who would buy a £ 500 pair of camera goggles to try to reach speeds of 62mph hurtling down a ski slope during the off - season			1
even fewer would relish the thought of rushing head - first down an ice track on a bob skeleton sled			2
but then @entity14 admits he is a ‘ possibly a bit bonkers ’			2
the @entity3 and @entity17 gold medallist would happily jump out of an aeroplane if he had not convinced himself his parachute would not open			2
he has skied since he was three , spent his childhood summers jumping off 30ft cliffs into water in the @entity23 and wants to try bungee - jumping when he retires			0
going the distance : @entity14 jumped further than any of his rivals yet again at the @entity17 games golden boy : the @entity3 champion added the @entity17 title to his list of achievements @entity14 , 27 and with his first child on the way this autumn , also has ambitions to try skeleton in september with a view to switching sports in 2018 , believing his speed and power would transfer well from long jump to an ice track			1
‘ if you catch a good jump it is a beautiful feeling of flying , so there is definitely some correlation there , ’ he says			0
his enthusiasm is refreshing , but there is just one problem : @entity14 is a notoriously fragile athlete			2
his former coach , @entity52 , reckoned he tore his hamstrings 17 times before winning @entity3 gold at @entity56 , while @entity14 nearly quit athletics altogether last summer after rupturing the muscle at the back of his left thigh			1
‘ i ’m sort of thinking it ’s not as hard , being in a crouch position running with a tea tray , jumping on it and praying you do n’t hit your head , ’ he says , smiling			0
up for it : the athlete says he does n't care that his @entity3 winning distance was the shortest since 1972 ‘ the weird thing i find in this country is that when you decide to have ambitions outside the one thing you do in life people find it very offensive			1
people are saying “ how dare you want to do another sport ? ” but i ’ve just got ambitions to do other things			0
i ’ve got so much more to achieve first			0
‘ i want to retain my @entity3 title in a couple of years , and if i get that done , i will consider that a pretty successful long - jumping career , so maybe i will turn my hand to a different sport			1
if i did n’t do that , i would always wonder			0
according to some , he was ‘ lucky ’ to win @entity3 gold on ‘ @entity91 ’ with 8.31 metres , the shortest winning distance since 1972			1
‘ only ’ 8.20m was enough to add the @entity17 title last month			0
the legality of the new @entity96 record of 8.51m he set this year was questioned by team - mate @entity97			0
on top : the ginger jumper wants to defend his @entity3 title in 2016 before changing sports he could back up @entity17 gold by winning the @entity103 in @entity104 this week			1
a field containing the likes of world champion @entity107 , 2010 @entity109 gold medallist @entity108 , @entity110 of @entity111 and @entity113 ’s @entity112 will , however , provide stiffer competition than @entity14 faced in @entity115			1
@entity14 knows he may well have to break the @entity96 record again to win in @entity117			2
finally , though , that might just shut everyone up			0
@entity14 said : ‘ i won an @entity3 by half a foot , which you would say is a good distance to win by			1
but then people dwell on the fact it was the shortest winning distance since ’ 72 ... but i do n’t care			0

@entity14 wants to defend @entity3 title in 2016 before leaving the sport
@entity3 champion is *eyeing* up skeleton for 2018 @entity132
before that he has the *challenge* of @entity103 this week
winning in @entity104 would help *silence* some of his many *critics*
