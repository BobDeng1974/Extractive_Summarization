' executed ' : undercover footage by campaigners shows a young male calf being shot in the head as it stands on a pile of calf carcasses in a trailer dead : the man leans in to finish the job male calves are virtually useless to farmers as they do not provide milk and there is little demand to buy them			1
campaigners claim the calf is one of around 100,000 male dairy animals executed shortly after birth each year as there is no market for them			1
the undercover film - makers from @entity41 ! claim the calf was shot by a member of @entity43			1
this was regularly attended by members of the @entity46 including @entity47 and his sons @entity49 and @entity50 before the 2004 foxhunting ban			2
the calf ’s corpse was later taken away to be fed to the hounds			2
the footage was secretly recorded by animal welfare activists who infiltrated a number of farms which supply milk to the confectionery industry			1
despite the distressing images , none of the actions seen in the film are illegal			1
used for food : workers discuss how to dispose of the dead animals royal connection : prince @entity47 on the @entity43 in 1999			2
he and his sons @entity49 and @entity50 regularly attended before the 2004 foxhunting ban dairy cows must be impregnated yearly to produce milk for human consumption but many of the male calves born are deemed surplus as demand for veal is limited			2
they are shot soon after birth and turned into pet food or other low - value products			2
speaking after the footage was released , @entity84 campaigner @entity82 said : ‘ consumers have a right to know the brutal truth that @entity15 ’s would rather keep quiet , how dairy products are produced			1
‘ the cruel parental separation and shooting of thousands of male dairy calves hardly fits in with their picturesque pastoral image			1
‘ one hundred thousand shots ring out on dairy farms every year because of unwanted males			2
sadly virtually all milk , has similar provenance			0
the cruelty is inherent to the industry			0
’ @entity101 , joint master of the @entity43 , last night said the hunt was ‘ helping out the farming community ’ to deal with unwanted calves			0
he said : ‘ it is not a question of being cruel			0
i was a farmer when calves were raised and put into the food chain			0
but through @entity111 legislation and @entity113 policy , there is no longer a market for them			0
death row : the video shows the cruel treatment the animals are subjected to before they are killed farm workers prepare to dispose of the carcasses of animals they 've killed food chain : the farm shown in the film supplies milk to @entity15 , which makes 250million bars of chocolate each year ‘ it has nothing to do with the hunts			1
it is simply non-viable for the farmers to raise calves			0
‘ the hunts who still collect calves are doing it purely for the benefit of the farmer			0
we do not enjoy it , it is simply a case of the rural community helping each other out			0
’ a spokesman for @entity149 , @entity15 ’s parent company , said the firm took animal welfare ‘ very seriously ’ and said it was an out - of - the - ordinary incident			0
