by @entity0 for @entity1 would they lie to you ? by @entity4 remember when politicians were taken seriously ? i can , just about , and i still have most of my own hair and teeth			1
for younger readers , though , honesty and integrity in politics are merely the stuff of legend			1
we know they existed once , like smallpox , but they have long since been eradicated from the general population			2
it ’s a sad state of affairs , but @entity4 ’s brief and brutally funny book shows how it has come about			1
famous fictional spin doctor @entity23 unleashing his wrath in an episode of the @entity27 's @entity26 @entity4 is @entity29 ’s @entity28 political correspondent , and has been listening to politicians , their advisers , flunkeys and cheerleaders for longer than he cares to think about			1
only rarely , though , and probably by accident , has he heard the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth			2
his book is a guide ( supposedly in its 14th edition ) for government high - ups who need to learn how to dissemble , obfuscate , distract and confuse			1
not that they would need such a guide			2
being able to do those things seems to be the prime qualification for getting the job in the first place			2
‘ the world can be divided into people who make complicated ideas seem simple , and people who make simple ideas complicated			2
whatever area you choose , from finance to academia to the church , you ’ll find that glory , money and power flow more freely to the complicators than the simplifiers			2
’ we , too , can succeed through obscurity			0
lying is dangerous if you ’re caught , and it ’s quite unnecessary			1
you can steer a truck through the gap between the lie and a simple truth			0
’ @entity4 ’s book teaches us how to load that truck			1
when asked about his relationship with @entity75 , @entity76 famously stonewalled the interviewer his ‘ building blocks of uncommunication ’ include the @entity78 , which is a truth placed before your audience not to impress in its own right , but to act as scaffolding for all the more important things you want left unsaid			0
in 2006 , @entity76 was asked if he was happy with the way @entity75 was giving up power			0
‘ it ’s a matter for him and the @entity93 , ’ said @entity76			1
‘ it ’s not really a matter for me at all			1
’ the interviewer pressed him further about his relationship with the great man			0
‘ we ’ve been working with each other for more than 20 years , ’ said @entity76			0
‘ i ’ve been chancellor while he ’s been prime minister for nine years , and we continue to work together			1
’ brilliant stonewalling , by any standards			0
politician - speak , in fact , has become so coded that it ’s essentially another language — what you might call the language of uncommunication			1
@entity4 has examples coming out of his ears			1
‘ i ca n’t promise that ’ means ‘ there is no way in hell that i ’m ever going to do that ’			0
as @entity119 points out in a pithy introduction , the best satire tells us things we already knew ‘ this is the right thing to do ’ means ‘ this is the thing we ’re going to do ’			0
‘ we need a grown - up debate ’ means ‘ i will only engage with people who agree with me ’			1
he is also full of good advice : ‘ true success is the result of talent , good luck and hard work			0
two of those you ca n’t count on , and the other one is a lot of effort			0
much better to take credit for a success that has already happened , ideally one close to where you were standing			0
’ is this too cynical ? i think not			0
as @entity119 points out in a pithy introduction , the best satire tells us things we knew in our bones already			0
in this case , we also know many of them from yes minister and @entity26 , but they ’re worth hearing again			0
i particularly liked @entity4 ’s suggestions for the ‘ rebranding ’ of certain historical events			1
the @entity155 become ‘ @entity156 ’			0
@entity158 ’s marital strategy was ‘ @entity159 ’			1
and ‘ creating @entity160 to drive demand for @entity162 ’ ? that ’s @entity164			2
if one or two of our politicians emerged from their bubble long enough to wonder why voters regard them with disdain , this book would be the perfect place to start .			2

for younger readers , though , honesty and integrity in politics are merely the stuff of legend
