' the first thing i asked him when i got on to @entity53 , ' @entity0 told @entity55 ' @entity54 last night after his meeting with @entity5 , is if he would come to the border			1
' i said mr. president , i said , ' " i really want you to come and see this cause this is important for you to absorb as a father , but more importantly as the @entity63 to see the humanitarian crisis and to also understand how you can move the border patrol forward , away from the 45 miles or so back they are today to be right on the border to see what the @entity16 is doing with our gun boats in the river to stop the criminal activity that 's going on			1
' that 's what the president needs to see , ' @entity0 continued			2
' he needs to understand instinctively and intuitively and with his own two eyes what ’s going on on the border			0
' @entity0 said @entity5 was only 311 miles from border town @entity79 , @entity1 , which does n't take long to get to in a plane			1
' @entity53 's a pretty fast ride , ' he said			0

' ' nothing has taken place down there that i 'm not intimately aware of , ' the president said			0

' @entity0 characterized the president 's decision not to join him as a mistake of monumental proportions			0
' i think about the criticism that @entity97 received when he did n't go to @entity98 [ right after @entity99 ] @entity100 , ' @entity0 told @entity54 , piggybacking off of fellow @entity1 lawmaker @entity102 's comments earlier this week that @entity5 's refusal to visit the border could be his ' @entity100 moment			1
' ' this is no different , ' @entity0 said			0
' i 'm pretty sure that if @entity97 had said , well , i sent my @entity108 director down multiple times that he would have still been criticized greatly because you need to go			0
' president @entity5 jokes with patrons at @entity112 as he hands over his credit card to pay for $ 300 of food he bought for his staff and two patrons he cut in front of in line @entity5 made a surprise visit to the @entity9 , @entity1 , restaurant before heading to the airport to fly back to @entity6 after several weeks of public back and forth about the @entity5 administration 's handling of the situation along the portion of the border that the @entity4 shares with @entity1 , @entity0 and the president put aside their differences yesterday and met to discuss the @entity1 governor 's concerns			1
both @entity0 and the president said the meeting went well , and @entity0 told @entity54 the president seemed to ' philosophically ' agree with him on the need to secure the border			2
' i may have been a bit of a thorn in his side over the years , ' he said , ' but i 've tried to do it in a respectful way and a thoughtful way			0
and what i think is right for the people of @entity1 , and in this case , what 's right for @entity4			0
' in a letter to the president today , @entity0 said he hoped their meeting was ' the beginning of a productive diaologue ' and reiterated what actions he 'd like to see the federal government take moving forward			2
those include : the deployment of 1,000 @entity158 to the border , medical screenings for all illegal immigrants who come to the @entity4 and changes to a federal law that disallows unaccompanied children from countries other than @entity3 or @entity166 who cross the border illegally to be sent home immediately			0
' additionally , mr. president , i can not stress enough how important it is for you to visit the borderto witness the damage that the failure to secure the border is doing to our country and to demonstrate for all @entity4 , as well as the governments of @entity3 , @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 , your commitment to ending this humanitarian crisis , ' @entity0 wrote			1
' your visit would also provide an ideal opportunity to meet with the @entity186 to discuss þermanent solutions to our border security issues			0
' because this issue deserves swift action , i am available to help facilitate this meeting with the delegation			0
