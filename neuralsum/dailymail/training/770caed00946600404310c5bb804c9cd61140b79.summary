on june 4 , 2010 she was told she had breast cancer			2
she said : ‘ when we went to get the results were not really concerned at all – no one thought it was anything			0
‘ i was n’t worried at all – we just thought it was the blocked milk duct			0

i just said “ i do n’t want to die ” and the doctor said he ’d get me fixed			0
’ ms @entity6 ( pictured before her illness ) said : ' it was a massive shock being diagnosed			1

it was horrendous ' however , in the summer of 2011 she took her daughter to the gp and while she was in the waiting room she noticed a sign showing the symptoms of ovarian cancer			0

’ ms @entity6 discussed the pregnancy with her oncologist who worked out she must have conceived about six months after her chemotherapy ended			1
ms @entity6 believes that having @entity7 saved her life and the couple see @entity147 as their miracle baby this meant the drugs would have just had time to leave her body meaning her baby should not be harmed by them			1
as a result , she continued with the pregnancy and @entity147 was born in january 2012			2
ms @entity6 said : ‘ he is our miracle baby			1
i think @entity7 saved my life as i would n’t have found the lump if i had n’t been pregnant and @entity147 is our miracle			1
