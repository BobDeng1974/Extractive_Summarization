in a move that could spell the end of high - speed car chases , joyriding , and even terrorist attacks , a @entity1 company has created a system that can stop vehicles at the press of a button			1
the @entity12 - stop system uses blasts of electromagnetic pulses to remotely shut off any car engines that targeted by the device			1
the system was created by @entity19 - based @entity18 and could also be used to stop the engines in boats because it can be triggered up to 165ft away			1
the @entity12 - stop system , demonstrated in this graphic , fires electronic pulses towards a targeted car			1
the pulses immobilise the engine			0
it can be triggered at a distance of up to 165ft and police , as well as governments , have already expressed an interest in using the system @entity33 works because the targeted radio frequency pulses ‘ confuse ’ the electronics within the car , and this causes the engine to cut out as a safety measure			1
the pulses travel through a wiring loom , or cable , which acts like an aerial to target where the pulses are fired			0
when a car enters the field of these pulses , the engine is cut off and rolls to a halt			0
as long as the car stays in this field range , the engine ca n't be restarted			0
@entity33 works because the targeted radio frequency pulses ‘ confuse ’ the electronics within the car , and this causes the engine to cut out as a safety measure			1
the radio frequencies used are from l and s parts of the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum			0
these frequencies are used in weather radar equipment , for example , as well as @entity64 ’s @entity63 and @entity65 communication satellites			0
the pulses travel through a wiring loom , or cable , which acts like an aerial that targets where the pulses are fired			0
when a car enters the field of these pulses , the engine is cut off and rolls to a halt			0
@entity76 's current prototype , pictured , weighs around 350kg and has been fitted onto 4x4 vehicles			0
future models could be designed to fit onto helicopters			2
the system can stop joyriders , for example , or defend buildings from terrorists driving cars fitted with bombs into the buildings product manager @entity88 said as long as the car stays in this field range , the engine ca n't be restarted			1
according to @entity88 , the system has already received interest from various governments and police forces and could be used as a ‘ non-lethal ’ weapon			2
it could be used to stop joyriders , for example , or defend buildings from terrorists driving cars fitted with bombs into the buildings			1
the @entity12 - stop system could also be fitted at harbour and sea checkpoints to stop boats from entering restricted areas			2
@entity76 ’s current prototype weighs around 350kg and has been fitted onto @entity111 and @entity112			2
future models may be designed to fit onto helicopters .			2

the @entity33 uses a blast of electromagnetic waves to stop engines
it can be triggered at a distance of up to 165ft and also works on boats
the waves is also used to disable a vehicle ’s on - board electronic systems
future plans could see the *technology* fitted onto helicopters
police and governments could also use it as a ' non-lethal weapon ' to stop joyriders and even car bombs
