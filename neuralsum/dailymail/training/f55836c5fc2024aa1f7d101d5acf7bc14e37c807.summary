@entity8 & @entity9 was chosen by miss @entity4 to make underwear for her @entity12 brand , sold in high street shops such as @entity14			1
in a 2012 tv series she documented the launch of the venture , which aimed to revive the ailing @entity19 textile industry which has been decimated by the availability of cheap imports			1
empty drawers : @entity8 & @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity23 was chosen by @entity4 for her three - part @entity27 series @entity28 business was booming at the @entity31 and @entity24 factory in @entity25 , @entity23 , after it was featured in a three - part @entity27 series @entity28			1
she was charged with reviving @entity19 manufacturing - and to prove that homegrown enterprise and workers could create high quality clothing			2
millions watched as eight raw apprentices were taken on board , overseen by @entity41 , whose family founded the factory in 1935			1
the resulting ‘ kinky knickers ’ range was a resounding success and helped prove @entity49 ’ ethos that quality , homegrown products could compete on the high street against cheap foreign imports			2
but now , less than two years later , the factory has closed and the firm has gone into administration , with the loss of 33 jobs			1
bosses pointed to a lack of pre-christmas orders from ‘ key customers ’ for the closure			2
revived : despite an early success which saw the factory double its workforce , the ' knicker factory ' has now been forced to close and fire 33 employees until recently the experiment was said to be a success for the @entity25 company			1
the colourful lace lingerie was said to be in such demand since going on sale in early 2012 at stores including boots , @entity77 and online fashion retailers , an initial production run for 5,000 led to orders for 45,000			1
eight apprentices were taken on originally , paid for by tv production company @entity82 for the first nine months			0
and more were taken on as the factory doubled their workforce to meet demand			1
one employee , who did n’t want to be named , said : ‘ it has come as such a shock , we had no idea the business was in trouble			0
’ @entity96 business restructuring partners , @entity97 and @entity98 , were appointed @entity99 on 15 january 2014 , a spokesman said			0
@entity97 , @entity96 business restructuring partner said : ‘ @entity101 employs 33 staff and regrettably , it has been necessary to make all employees redundant			0
‘ @entity104 are currently investigating options to recommence trading and fulfil customer orders , with a view to affecting a sale of the business as a going concern			0
‘ a drop in @entity114 orders from key customers and a decline in sales volumes has significantly affected the business and resulted in a deterioration of its working capital position			0
however , we are doing everything we can to try to secure a future for the business , and we are hopeful of securing a sale			0
‘ to that end , the administration team would welcome approaches from commercial parties interested in acquiring the business or assets			0
’ @entity130 knickers : @entity49 with a pair of the popular pants made using lace from a @entity135 supplier bad sales : @entity137 blamed ' poor @entity139 sales ' for the closure @entity25 knicker factory @entity8 and @entity24 ’s manufacturing had been mothballed ahead of @entity49 ’s tv show			1
speaking at the time of the show @entity49 said : ‘ the reaction has been amazing			0
now the plan is to export and i ’m hoping we ’ll have another two factories making the knickers			0
‘ i ’ve already had to take on an additional two apprentices to cope with demand			0
there is a real appetite for @entity19 - made clothing in this country			1
‘ i sincerely believe that people want to buy @entity19 , but that choice was taken away from them			0
’ speaking in 2012 md @entity160 said the knickers were so popular his staff were struggling to cope with demand			2
in december 2012 a fourth instalment of the show was broadcast to show the progress on the project			2
it included how the team had to scale up production to cope with the huge demand for the frilly knickers , which were being sold for a pricey but affordable £ 10			0
ahead of the @entity27 show @entity8 & @entity9 were a family firm established 70 years ago who had to send production overseas to make ends meet			1
only a tiny section of their huge factory on the outskirts of @entity23 was being used with rows of neglected sewing machines under covers .			2
