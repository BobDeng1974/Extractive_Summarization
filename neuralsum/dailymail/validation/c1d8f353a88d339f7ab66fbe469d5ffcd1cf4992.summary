there ’s been a lot of focus lately on the rise of virtual reality			0
but one firm has developed what it considers to be the next level in gaming - a headset that lets you control on - screen and physical objects using just your mind			1
in a demonstration at @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity13 put the technology to the test to see if it lives up to the hype			1
brain power : the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) and @entity23 - based @entity22 have developed what it considers to be the next level in gaming - a headset ( pictured ) that lets you control on - screen and physical objects using just your mind the game was developed in partnership with the @entity21 ( @entity21 ) and @entity23 - based @entity22			1
a ‘ driver ’ is wired up to @entity32 ’s electroencephalography ( @entity34 ) headset and the device is trained to read their unique brain patterns			1
the first step involves training the headset to learn the wearer ’s ‘ neutral ’ state			1
this involves ‘ clearing their brain ’			1
they are then asked to think of a repetitive task that will associated with driving the car			0
this does n't need to be a driving - related thought ; it can be any thought that the wearer can continuously think and repeat			0
@entity53 tried out the @entity21 and @entity22 technology at @entity15 in @entity16			1
intense : @entity13 's @entity53 tries out the cutting - edge technology for herself ‘ this is the first time i ’ve worn an @entity34 headset and expected it to be uncomfortable and intrusive , but it ’s the opposite			1
you hardly notice you ’re wearing it , although its not the most discreet wearable			0
‘ training the headset took less than a minute , for both the neural and push states , but trying to clear your brain is tricky at the best of times , let alone at a noisy and busy trade show			1
the ‘ push ’ state activity can be any thought that the wearer can think about over and over again			2
the more precise the thought , the more accurate the pattern and command			0
i chose to think about the chords of @entity79 on a piano , but this could be anything from writing your name to thinking of person ’s face			0
as long as the thought is the same each time , the technology will work at its most efficient			0
during the race i did n’t realise i was moving the car because i was too busy thinking about the piano chords			2
my race time was nine seconds , which put me in 63rd place on the leaderboard or more than 100			0
it ’s a very strange experience			0
it does n’t feel like you ’re doing anything and you ca n’t become immersed in the game or pay attention to the position of the cars because you ’re concentrating on your thought pattern			0
the technology feels extremely futuristic and i can see its potential but i felt it took away from the enjoyment of playing the game			2
’ this is known as the ‘ push ’ state and for @entity13 ’s test this involved thinking about playing greensleeves on a piano and imaging the finger positions as they move through the chords			2
once the headset is trained the game begins			2
the wheels of an on - screen car begin to spin to signal that the brain patterns are being recognised			2
the wearer is then asked to think about their repetitive task , at which point the car begins to move			0
once the headset is trained the game begins			0
the wheels of an on - screen car begin to spin to signal that the brain patterns are being recognised.the wearer is then asked to think about their repetitive task , at which point the car begins to move			2
during the demonstration , these brain waves moved a car the size of a shoebox around a track and each race involves two players wired up to the headset			1
the emotive headsets are embedded with sensors that record electrical activity along the wearer ’s scalp , forehead and above the right ear			0
these sensors measure and monitor brain waves and these patterns are converted to commands using a brain - computer interface			1
the technology is currently a proof - of - concept and there are no immediate plans to release the game and headset			1
however , the @entity22 headset is available from $ 499 ( £ 324 ) and it will work with existing brain - computer interface games and software that work with @entity34 readings			1
the @entity32 headset used for the demonstration is called @entity165 and is available to pre-order ahead of the general release in april .			0

@entity21 mind - controlled game is powered by an @entity22 headset
headset uses electroencephalography ( @entity34 ) to monitor brain waves
training *session* teaches the headset what ‘ commands ’ to *respond* to
then the ‘ driver ’ simply has to think about moving the car to race
product is a concept and there are no immediate plans to sell the game
technology is on display at @entity15 in @entity16
