some 850 people living in the city of @entity2 are ' officially ' over the age of 164 , according to @entity5 records that list all their birth dates as 1 january 1850			1
officials discovered that hundreds of residents were the implausible age when they were alerted to a quirk in the system left over from a ' bygone era '			1
they explained that previous practices allowed residents not to provide their exact birthdays when registering to vote - and 1 january 1850 is the default date for those whose birth dates were unknown or unclear			1
previous practices meant that residents in @entity2 did not have to provide their exact birth date when registering to vote in the city - and this has led to some rather confusing ages being listed on official records some of the new voters , mostly women , simply wrote that they were ' 21 + ' - above the legal voting age - when registering to vote , the @entity24 reported			1
' it 's a left - over vestige from a bygone era , ' @entity5 executive director @entity27 told the newspaper			0
' they were all listed as age 164			0
it 's a little quirk in the system			2
it 's not widespread , ' he added , noting there are more than four million registered voters			0
the bizarre discovery came after the @entity24 reported on the case of 73 - year - old @entity43 who was listed on her official voter registration card as ' age : 164 '			0
850 residents were given birth dates that would mean they were alive in the days when @entity49 was president of the @entity50 ms @entity43 , who lives in the @entity51 , was in fact born on 14 february 1941			1
' that 's not me ! i do n't know why they did that ! , ' she told the newspaper , when alerted to her ' official ' age			0
' that 's very strange			0
i 've been voting for many years , ' she added - just not in the 1800s			0
then this week , a search of the records in all five boroughs of @entity2 found 849 more voters with the same implausible birth date as ms pabellon - meaning the city supposedly has a total of 850 voters who were alive when @entity49 was president			2
the elections board explained that it switched to computerized databases in 1999 and 2006 , and twice sent out notices imploring the 164 - year - olds to provide their real birth dates			1
but since most of them ignored the requests - and to comply with state rules election officials were required to write in a specific date of birth for all voters or remove them from the rolls - the birth date 1 january 1850 continued to be used			1
@entity2 who registered after 2006 were required to provide their true birth dates			1
as the rules now stand , a voter without a date of birth who shows up on @entity89 will not be in the register , and will be declared ineligible to vote			2
but the fake birth dates have caused some concern about the potential for fraud			1
it 's insane , ' @entity97 , who challenged @entity51 assemblyman @entity98 in the @entity100 primary , told the @entity24			0
' the board of elections is very inept			0
how many people are they doing this to ? this is the type of inattention that allows fraud to take place			2
' at a meeting yesterday , board of election commissioners and mr @entity27 discussed ways to fix the issue , including sending out another letter requesting the real dates of birth and having staffers undertake the lengthy task of trying to contact the 850 by phone			2
mr @entity27 said the matter will be revisited after the november 4 election .			0

a quirk in the system has given hundreds of residents the *impossible* age
january 1 , 1850 , is default date for those whose birth dates were unknown
in the past people did not have to provide exact birthdays when registering
@entity2 registered after 2006 were required to provide true birth dates
the fake birth dates have caused some concern about the potential for fraud
