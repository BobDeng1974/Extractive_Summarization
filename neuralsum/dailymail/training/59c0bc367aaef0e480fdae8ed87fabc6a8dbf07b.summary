by @entity0 published : 11:20 est , 31 may 2013 updated : 12:16 est , 31 may 2013 ' absurd ' : @entity1 , 82 , denies 13 charges of indecent assault and two of indecency with a child a former headmaster of a top private school today claimed allegations that he sexually abused his pupils had been made up by ' frustrated under - achievers looking for an excuse '			1
@entity1 @entity13 , 82 , today denied the charges against him as he told a jury that he had never touched any boys at @entity18 school			1
he claimed the accusations against him were malicious and denied any impropriety during the period in question from 1959 to 1970			1
' i 've had the experience of being school governor at five different schools where there have been instances of this nature , ' @entity1 told a jury at @entity31			1
' they were all concerning men in their 40s and 50s who had not achieved as much as they would have liked to achieve			0
' when prosecutor @entity36 said that his stance was ' absurd ' @entity1 responded saying : ' it 's not absurd , because it 's true			2
' @entity1 , is facing 13 charges of indecent assault and two of indecency with a child at the school where @entity45 was a pupil			1
@entity1 was asked about an allegation that he once stroked the inside of a boy 's groin in his car as he drove him home after a rugby match			2
he replied : ' i deny that			0
i might have patted him or touched him , but not stroked			0
there 's a big difference there			0
tapping and patting are not sensual , but stroking is			0
' the jury has been told @entity1 encouraged an atmosphere of sexual freedom among the boys at the school , and abused boys as they slept at night in their dormitories , touched them in his car , and on a school trip to @entity68			1
some of the alleged sexual encounters were said to have taken place at his teacher 's cottage where he still lives near the school grounds in @entity74 , @entity75			0
police started investigating the well - known headmaster in 2001 , when five former boys claimed they were molested at the school			2
although 12 boys eventually made accusations against him , @entity1 was charged in august last year for allegations relating to seven of the children - now aged in their late 50s or 60s			1
none of the men can be named for legal reasons			0
some of the accusers played for the school 's rugby team , and the jury heard their names appear in meticulous handwritten records @entity1 made of matches which were kept in faded exercise books in a desk draw in his personal study			1
@entity1 was accused of not mentioning the records to police officers , which he said he had moved from his desk to a cupboard following his arrest in november 2011			2
however , the former teacher claimed it was the police 's fault that the books had not come to light until the trial was into its seventh week			0
@entity1 said : ' i did not conceal them ... i did not suppress them			2
it was just a complete botched search			0
i was amazed to discover all my information from the school was still intact			0
it could have been easily found and it was not hidden			0
' he also admitted he had had a recent ' clear out ' of rubbish , which included throwing away calendars from his time at @entity18			0
@entity1 taught at the school from 1952 and became headteacher in 1968 until his retirement in 1993			1
' absurd ' : the retired headteacher told a jury he never touched any boys at the exlusive prep school in a ' sensual ' way police began investigating him in 2001 after one former pupil told his doctor that he had been abused			1
the jury has heard the victims had described @entity1 as ' gentle ' towards them , and would not threaten @entity132 , who is the subject of two current charges , even described him as ' inspirational '			1
another pupil , who later enjoyed success as an amateur rugby player , attributed this to @entity1 , who coached the school 's team as well as teaching @entity141			1
the victim , who is not one of the seven on the indictment , revealed that the abuse had taken place			0
however , he was reluctant to initially lay the blame with @entity1 as he had been a family friend as well as a teacher			2
one fellow pupil had witnessed @entity1 touching that boy 's penis while on a school trip to @entity68 - but left the hotel room once he realised what was happening and said that nothing was ever said about what had occurred			1
all of the allegations relate to @entity1 's tenure at prestigious @entity160 , which was founded in @entity161 , @entity162 in 1904 and moved to its present site in 1938			1
it became a charitable trust in 1968			0
the Â£ 20,000 per year school , which has capacity for 240 boys aged between seven and 13 , boasts 40 acres of grounds and playing fields			2
many pupils go on to elite secondar schools including @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175			0
@entity160 counts deputy prime minister @entity45 among its high - profile alumni , along with former @entity179 cricket captain @entity178 and actor @entity180 - the son of playwright @entity181			1
@entity45 joined the school as a pupil in 1975 before later moving to the prestigious @entity185 trial continues			2
