the trials of three of four members of @entity3 's marching band on charges of felony hazing and manslaughter have been postponed until april			1
but the trial of a fourth member began with jury selection today , nearly three years after drum major @entity10 died from being beaten			1
judge @entity11 delayed the trial for defendants @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 after their attorneys said they did not have the opportunity to question witnesses about hazing charges that were added to the case			1
@entity23 's trial is expected to last a week			1
@entity23 , center , waits for jury selection today , as he stands trial in @entity27 , @entity28 all four have pleaded not guilty in the death of @entity30 , of @entity31 , @entity32			1
he died from what authorities say was a hazing ritual in november 2011			2
his death has shone a spotlight on a hazing ritual at @entity3 known as ' crossing @entity39 , ' and caused the band — which had played at the @entity41 and before @entity43 presidents — to be suspended for over a year			2
it also contributed to the resignation of the university 's president			2
hours after a football game in @entity50 , band members boarded @entity51 parked outside a hotel			0
they pummeled @entity30 , 26 , and two other band members as they tried to wade their way through a pounding gauntlet of fists , drumsticks and mallets from the front to the back of the bus			0
after making it to the back , @entity30 vomited and complained of trouble breathing			0
he soon fell unconscious and could n't be revived			0
he died from hemorrhagic shock and his autopsy showed extensive internal bleeding			0

all but the four remaining defendants have had their cases settled , and several of them will be called as witnesses to describe what happened on the bus			0
state attorney @entity86 said he wants jurors to learn about the history of hazing in @entity3 's marching band so they understand that what happened on the bus was a ' consistent pattern			2
' besides ' crossing @entity39 , ' jurors likely will learn about other hazing rituals by band members			0
those include ' the hot seat , ' when band members sit in bus seats with heads between legs as other band members beat them , as well as ' prepping , ' when a shirtless band member is slapped on the back and chest			0
@entity14 ( pictured left ) and @entity15 ( pictured right ) have had their trials postponed ' they got on the bus for one thing , and that is to break the law , ' @entity86 said at a recent hearing			1
' the jury has to understand this was n't an isolated incident , that these four defendants knew what they were doing and that they were breaking the law			0
' defense attorneys have challenged @entity28 's anti-hazing law , claiming that statute is so vague that what happened on the band bus can be considered a competition , not hazing			2
' the hazing statute , the way it is written is crazy , ' @entity125 , one of the attorneys for @entity23 , said at a recent hearing			1
@entity11 denied a defense motion asking that the hazing statute be ruled unconstitutional , but she reached a compromise with defense attorneys and @entity86 on whether witnesses can say the word ' hazing ' during the trial			2
the judge ruled witnesses could use the word ' hazing ' if they had previously read the statute defining it , such as in the anti-hazing pledges @entity3 band members had to sign even before @entity30 's death			1
defense attorneys and prosecutors agreed no band members have said in depositions that @entity30 's sexual orientation played a role in the hazing , so the fact that he was gay wo n't be brought up during the trial			1
defense attorneys say @entity30 's body may have been tampered with when it left the custody of the medical examiner 's office so organs could be harvested			0
they also say the coroner uses analogies about how @entity30 died that could be misconstrued by jurors .			0

@entity23 's trial is expected to last a week - for the death of @entity10 in 2011
@entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16 have had their trials postponed until april
all four have pleaded not guilty in the death of @entity10 , of @entity31 , @entity32
