celebrity lawyer @entity0 is calling for @entity1 to be prosecuted on a defamation charge , saying an obscure @entity4 law can be used to punish him for calling a college student a ' slut ' and a ' prostitute ' on the air			1
the 70 - year - old sent a letter to the @entity11 on thursday saying prosecutors should consider a charge under an 1883 law making it a misdemeanor to question a woman 's chastity			1
' he has personally targeted her and vilified her , and he should have to bear the consequences of his extremely outrageous , tasteless and damaging conduct , ' @entity0 said in a phone interview on friday			2
controversial : talk show host @entity1 apologised to a @entity23 law student he branded a ' slut ' and ' prostitute ' after several advertisers left his program @entity1 had no immediate comment on the letter and did not address it in his radio show on friday			1
@entity31 , a spokeswoman for @entity33 's @entity32 , said the network had nothing further to add			2
@entity36 , the county attorney , said she forwarded the letter to the state attorney 's office , which handles criminal matters			2
the state attorney 's office had no immediate comment			2
@entity0 focused her efforts on @entity11 because @entity1 both lives and broadcasts his show from the county			0
she cited a state law that says , ' whoever speaks of and concerning any woman , married or unmarried , falsely and maliciously imputing to her a want of chastity , shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree			1
' @entity0 has a long history of taking on high - profile cases , most recently representing a woman who claimed to have been sexually harassed by former presidential candidate @entity56 , and a woman who received lewd messages from former rep. @entity59			0
dissatisfied : @entity0 , left , calls @entity1 's apology to @entity61 , right , ' meaningless ' whether prosecutors will take the request seriously and whether such a case could pose @entity66 issues remained to be seen			0
but the law should be used because it is still on the books , @entity0 said			1
' i 'm sure he has an army of highly paid attorneys in his entourage to advise him about how he should defend himself , ' she said			0
' i 'm concerned about the impact that he has had and that he wished to have had on women who choose to speak out and exercise their free speech			0
' the tumult began last week when @entity1 discounted the appearance of a @entity23 law student , @entity61 , on @entity81			1
@entity61 testified to congressional @entity82 in support of their national health care policy that would compel her catholic college 's health plan to cover her birth control , a comment @entity1 seized on			1
he said last wednesday : ' what does it say about the college coed ... who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex ? it makes her a slut , right ? it makes her a prostitute			1
she wants to be paid to have sex			0
' after an outcry - and the decision by numerous businesses to pull their ads from his show - he apologised , saying : ' i should not have used the language i did , and it was wrong			0
' @entity0 called his apology ' meaningless ' .			0
