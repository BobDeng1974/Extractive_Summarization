by @entity0 published : 07:31 est , 14 november 2012 updated : 11:11 est , 14 november 2012 @entity1 today admitted that it had received - and complied with - a record number of requests from governments to reveal information about its users			1
the latest edition of the search giant 's @entity8 shows governments around the world made nearly 21,000 requests to access its data in the first six months of 2012			2
the @entity15 government made the most demands , asking for users ' details 7,969 times between january and june this year			2
the @entity19 came sixth - behind @entity20 and @entity21 - with 1,425 requests			1
what does @entity1 know about you ? the latest transparency report from the search giant showed it had received more requests than ever before to share information about its users with governments ' this is the sixth time we ’ve released this data , and one trend has become clear : government surveillance is on the rise , ' @entity32 , a senior policy analyst for @entity1 , said in a blog post			1
' in the first half of 2012 , there were 20,938 inquiries from government entities around the world			0
those requests were for information about 34,614 accounts			0
' in common with other technology and communications firms , @entity1 is regularly asked by courts and government agencies around the world to hand over information about its users			0
as well as search histories , it holds data on users ' contacts and communications through @entity61 , viewing preferences on @entity55 , photos on @entity51 , documents stored on @entity53 , and information about authors ' identities on @entity64			0
' government surveillance is on the rise ' : this graph shows how the number of requests @entity1 has received from governments has steadily increased since it began releasing its bi-annual reports the company has published its @entity8 twice a year since 2009 and each time has revealed a steady rise in government demands for data			2
in its first report it revealed 12,539 requests			0
@entity1 does not always comply with demands to reveal user data , and its report also revealed what percentage of requests were accepted			1
unsurprisingly , the @entity15 again topped this list , with @entity1 complying with 90 per cent of requests from agencies in its home jurisdiction			2
the company was notably less cooperative with @entity19 authorities , accepting 64 per cent of requests			1
@entity1 also revealed a spike in the number of requests by governments to remove content from its services , after this figure remained largely flat from 2009 to 2011			1
in the first half of 2012 , there were 1,791 requests from government officials around the world to remove 17,746 pieces of content from @entity1 - run services , up from 1,048 requests in the second half of 2011			1
@entity1 revealed the number of requests by @entity19 authorities in particular had nearly doubled since its previous report , with many relating to criticism of the police			1
the most frequent reason authorities worldwide offered in requests to take down content was that it was defamatory , with privacy and security coming in second , and the catch - all ' other ' coming in third			1
censorship : this graph shows how the number of requests to take down content from its services has spiked in the past six months after staying largely flat for the past two years a spokesman for the company told the @entity123 that the @entity8 acts as a bellwether for government behaviour around the world			2
' it reflects laws on the ground			0
for example in @entity132 there are specific laws about defaming public figures whereas in @entity20 we get requests to remove @entity139 content , ' she told the broadcaster			1
' and in @entity141 we get a lot of requests to remove content during elections because there is a law banning parodies of candidates			1
' this pair of bar graphs breaks down the requests to remove content by source and by reason			1
defamation was the most popular reason given for content to be removed , followed by privacy and security @entity158 , director of privacy and civil liberties campaign group @entity160 , said : ' it should trouble everyone that as the @entity162 is trying to justify monitoring all our emails , website visits and social media messages there are hundreds of requests for data every year being refused by @entity1			2
' the existing system is failing to provide proper checks on when our personal information is handed over to the authorities and it is madness to take a bad system and massively increase the amount of data being captured without first fixing the existing rules and protections			0
' other companies should follow @entity1 ’s lead and publish details on the requests they have to establish the true scale of the current surveillance powers			0
' it highlights how governments already access data from these companies , making it even more suspicious that they are seeking to make it easier to be able to snoop on us under the current proposals			0
' in her blog post commenting on the report , ms @entity32 added : ' the information we disclose is only an isolated sliver showing how governments interact with the @entity199 , since for the most part we do n’t know what requests are made of other technology or telecommunications companies			0
' but we ’re heartened that in the past year , more companies like @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 have begun to share their statistics too			0
' our hope is that over time , more data will bolster public debate about how we can best keep the @entity199 free and open			0

@entity15 tops snoopers ' league table , with nearly *8,000* requests for user data
@entity19 comes in sixth - behind @entity20 and @entity21 - with 1,425 requests
report also reveals a spike in requests to remove content from services
requests for content removal by @entity19 authorities have nearly doubled
