while @entity1 still have one warm - up game left against @entity3 , @entity0 drew their final match against minnows @entity6 – who are 102 places below @entity1 in the @entity8 - on wednesday			1
and post-match , manager @entity9 and his players admitted that they are some way short of their best ahead of their opening game against @entity1 in @entity16 on june 14			0
they ca n’t defend at corners @entity9 admitted that his side had to improve on ‘ a few things ’ and that one of those was a weakness at corners			1
@entity6 ’s shock equaliser came as former - @entity44 centre - back @entity43 lost his marker to nod home in almost the last passage of play in @entity0 ’s @entity50 warm - up campaign			1
centre - back @entity51 admitted : ‘ we need to pay more attention at set - pieces			0
we were good for 50 - 60 minutes but after that we got a bit stretched and we lost our heads a bit			0
’ with @entity60 and @entity61 both scoring at dead ball opportunities against @entity63 last week , @entity20 would be foolish not to focus on a typical @entity65 strength and @entity22 weakness			0
they are running out of time to get it right @entity71 right - back @entity70 conceded that @entity0 ’s new system ‘ needs time to find its balance ’ as well as a need to ‘ improve in attack ’ while @entity76 blamed the draw on being ‘ the first game in which we tried a new plan ’			1
back to basics : @entity70 says @entity0 are still coming to terms with how to play talking tactics : @entity0 coach @entity9 ( right ) gets his point across to @entity86 ‘ we ’re working hard , but we know that when the @entity50 comes around we ’ll be ready , ’ he added			1
unfortunately for the young pair , they do n’t have a lot of time			0
there are 10 days until the @entity16 showdown but wednesday was @entity0 ’s last game before then			2
@entity1 , on the other hand , have another game to help them find their way – albeit without the suspended @entity99 who had been touted as a potential starter			0
they waste chances on goal another problem pointed out by @entity70 was @entity0 ’s profligacy in attack – claiming that they were the better side before being ‘ caught with a sucker - punch ’			1
@entity9 singled out @entity24 as the chief culprit , throwing away three good chances			1
wasteful : @entity24 missed a host of chances against @entity6 on wednesday evening ‘ @entity24 had two good opportunities in the first half , and had another chance when @entity117 came on , ’ he said			1
‘ we ’ve missed a few chances tonight , and then conceded a goal from a corner			0
’ if @entity1 can wind - up and frustrate the @entity22 talisman – which is n’t usually too difficult – they might be able to provide a similar ‘ sucker - punch ’ to last night ’s opponents.4			0
they rely too much on space out wide @entity0 ’s goal on wednesday came from the right wing , and @entity70 made it clear afterwards that exploiting the flanks was key to their new system			2
@entity76 added to his team - mate ’s sentiments , saying : ‘ the coach asked us to play between the lines , but it was not easy because @entity6 firmly closed spaces			2
’ quick feet : @entity76 ( right ) gets away from a @entity140 defender @entity141 and @entity142 will need to be at their best to stop the @entity0 wide - men but also ready to use their opponents ’ new system to their advantage			2
@entity70 and @entity9 both mentioned the amount of space left out wide and @entity1 ’s full - backs should be key to taking three points in @entity16			2
they have n’t won since september wednesday represented @entity0 ’s seventh consecutive game without a win , with the likes of @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and @entity159 getting results against the @entity0			1
plenty to ponder : @entity9 has much to work on before @entity0 's game with @entity1 on june 14 along with @entity6 , @entity1 are ranked above all of these sides – only @entity164 and @entity165 are better teams in the winless sequence			1
and @entity51 ’s assertion that @entity0 are not ‘ great at friendlies , but fortunately seem to be okay when it gets serious ’ does n’t wash			0
@entity9 said afterwards that he ‘ did n’t see anything worrying ’ from his side – but he is in denial , even later admitting that they were lacking flair			0
@entity1 should make it eight games without a win .			0

@entity0 could only draw 1 - 1 with minnows @entity6 on wednesday
@entity9 's side have not won in seven games
@entity9 *slammed* *striker* @entity24 for his wastefulness
