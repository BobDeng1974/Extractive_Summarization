@entity9 , formely the number two spy at the agency , called mr @entity3 ’s actions the most serious leak of intelligence in @entity7 history – actions that have done far greater harm than good			1
his comments echo similar remarks made earlier this month by the head of @entity22 intelligence agency @entity21			0
he 's a traitor : former @entity2 deputy director @entity9 blasted @entity3 in a @entity25 interview aired sunday night ‘ i do not believe he is a whistle blower , ’ mr @entity9 told 60 minutes			1
‘ i do not believe he is a hero , i believe he has betrayed his country			0
’ sharing an opinion held by many @entity7 officials , the ex-spook claimed the man revered by many is a reckless traitor who has crippled the @entity35 ’ intelligence gathering			1
‘ i think this is the most serious leak – the most serious compromise of classified information in the history of the @entity7 intelligence community , ’ mr @entity9 continued			1
saying both the amount and type of information revealed by the spy secret leaker is equally damning , mr @entity9 bemoaned the disclosure of the @entity2 budget			1
the ‘ black book , ’ as it is referred to , details the agency ’s spending across all activites			0
he did more harm than good : mr @entity9 contends the @entity55 's @entity3 series put @entity7 ' lives in danger ‘ [ enemies ] could focus their counterintelligence efforts on those places where we ’re being successful , and not worry as much about those places where we ’re not being as successful , ’ mr @entity9 lamented			1
when @entity25 correspondent @entity65 suggested it was like giving a playbook to the other team , the former @entity64 intelligence briefer nodded in agreement			0
if that sentiment sounds familiar , that ’s because it is			0
@entity21 chief @entity71 earlier this month called the @entity55 ’s series of collaborations with mr @entity3 a ‘ gift ’ to terrorists			2
‘ it causes enormous damage to make public the reach and limits of @entity83 techniques			0
such information hands the advantage to the terrorists , ’ mr @entity71 said in an oct 9 speech			0
‘ unfashionable as it might seem , that is why we must keep secrets secret , and why not doing so causes such harm , ' he continued			0
mr @entity71 claimed in the speech , given at a @entity93 think - tank , that there are several thousand @entity22 - based terrorist operatives who have benefitted from the @entity3 exposés			2
fury : the spy chief : @entity21 director - general @entity71 has blasted the @entity55 's publication of @entity22 's espionage capabilities even worse , mr @entity9 claims , is the possibility that mr @entity3 ’s files were compromised as he trotted across the globe from @entity104 to @entity105 , then @entity106 to @entity107			1
‘ we have to assume that any material mr @entity3 had with him when he was in @entity106 , and now in @entity109 , has been compromised – i think we have to assume that , ’ said the former second - in - command			2
currently squirreled away in @entity109 after being granted temporary political asylum , mr @entity3 has rarely been seen in public except to receive an award for ‘ integrity in @entity116			2
’ that award could n’t be more juxtaposed with the way mr @entity3 ’s government views him			0
‘ what @entity3 did has put @entity7 at greater risk because terrorists learn from leaks , they will be more careful , ’ said mr @entity9			1
‘ we will not get the intelligence we would have gotten otherwise			0
