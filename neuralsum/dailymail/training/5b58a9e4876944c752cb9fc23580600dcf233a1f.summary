a study has claimed that the fragrance of lavender can have a positive effect on how trustworthy a person seems			1
the researchers say that the scent of the plant promotes relaxation , which can help create mutual trust between two people			1
and they say their findings could have important implications in areas such as team sports and negotiations			0
they asked 60 volunteers to take part in a ' trust ' study			1
some were given the scent of lavender , peppermint or just nothing			1
people were more likely to lend money when they smelled lavender the study was carried out by dr @entity35 and dr @entity36 from @entity18 in the @entity19 and published in the journal frontiers in @entity38			1
dr @entity36 told @entity40 said that the effect was likely due to the calming effect of lavender			1
this hypothesis is supported by the fact that , from an anatomical point of view , the olfactory nerve is connected to the medial prefrontal cortex a brain region that ' “ controls ” the way we trust others , ' she said			0
scientific research commissioned by @entity56 and conducted with the @entity57 revealed brits believe we are more trustworthy , friendly and attractive in video than photos			0
both sexes perceive people more positively in video , although women are far less positive about their own sex			0
men are overtly more willing to see improvements in other men			0
videos and photographs of volunteers were used to develop an interactive psychology - driven study of 2,000 @entity76 consumers			2
participants were tasked with judging men and women in video and images based on their appearance , trustworthiness , friendliness , and strength , as well as probed on their own online sharing habits			0
according to the data , men find other men more trustworthy than they do women in video than they do in photo			0
when women were asked the same question , they again found men more trustworthy than they found other women			2
to determine the effect of fragrances , the researchers enlisted 60 volunteers			1
in the research , they exposed one group of test persons to the aroma of lavender , a second group to the aroma of peppermint and a third control group had no aroma			2
subsequently , the test persons played a trust game , to measure how much one test person trusts the other			0
a trustor was given five euros and was free to decide how much of that money he would give to a trustee in each round of the game			0
the trustor would then receive extra money , but only if the trustee gave him enough money in return			0
the money transferred to the trustee by the trustor served as an indicator of mutual trust			2
it was found that people gave significantly more money to the other person when they were exposed to the aroma of lavender than those exposed to peppermint or no aroma			1
‘ our results might have various serious implications for a broad range of situations in which interpersonal trust is an essential element , ’ said dr @entity35			0
‘ smelling the aroma of lavender may help a seller to establish more easily a trusting negotiation to sell a car , or in a grocery store it may induce consumers to spend more money buying products			2
‘ the smell of lavender may also be helpful in sport psychology to enhance trust and build team spirit , for example in the case of team games such as soccer and volleyball			2
’ the researchers said the aroma of lavender may help a person establish an air of trust in negotiations , for example selling a car ( stock image shown )			1
the effect could be due to the calming effect of lavender , and the plant camille may apparently work the same way			1
