@entity0 — forlorn , curt and quiet - voiced — had rarely looked more vulnerable than as he left the paddock to spend a night alone with his hopes and thoughts			1
the world championship is still his to lose			2
he is 17 points ahead of his @entity7 colleague @entity6 — who took pole — and will start only one place behind him on the grid at the @entity11			1
if he finishes where he starts — second — he will be enshrined in @entity14 history as only the fourth @entity15 to win two championships			1
@entity17 is one , the others are @entity19 and sir @entity20 , the last to accomplish the feat 43 years ago			2
@entity0 appeared vulnerable ahead of the final race of the season at the @entity11 @entity0 will battle @entity7 team - mate @entity6 for the drivers ' championship on sunday @entity0 qualified in second place and will win the title if he can finish in the same position but to observe @entity0 here after @entity6 ’s virtuoso lap was not to see a man happily embracing his destiny			1
@entity34 , the 1996 champion and son of @entity17 , summed it up perfectly : ‘ @entity6 is doing everything — and i mean everything — to get the high ground over @entity0			1
@entity0 looks sometimes as if @entity6 is getting to him			1
i am concerned about that for @entity0 ’s sake			1
’ @entity6 was 0.386sec faster in qualifying , giving him an 11th pole to his rival ’s seven this season			1
@entity0 , a venerated one - lap specialist , must find that perturbing and inexplicable			1
both men made a few mistakes over the three sessions			0
@entity0 locked up and ran far on to the kerbs ; @entity6 ran dramatically wide in the second session			1
when he set the fastest lap , @entity6 ’s wife @entity52 and the @entity7 ’ hierarchy celebrated			1
the man himself put up a thumb and thrust a forearm out as he drove back into the pit lane			0
it was a gesture of intent			0
@entity6 celebrates after wining his 11th pole position of the season with the fastest qualifying lap @entity6 is still in contention for the championship as double points are on offer in the season finale the @entity70 driver appeared more confident as the season reaches its nail biting conclusion this title fight is now going to be won as much in the six inches between the ears as the 3.47 miles of hot track			1
and @entity6 seems to be winning the psychological battle			1
‘ pressure , ’ said the @entity70 , ‘ is one of the hopes that i have , a bit like today and in the last race in @entity82			0
‘ they are the kind of opportunities i am looking for			0
i am pushing to keep the [ pressure ] level extremely high			0
@entity0 has everything to lose ; i have everything to gain , so the pressure is on him			1
’ @entity0 has made a virtue of having no friends or family with him in the paddock here			1
there is just him and his @entity98 trainer @entity97			0
but is his singular approach really a help ? or did he miss the companionship of more familiar faces when the going got tough under the night ’s sky ? by contrast , @entity6 ’s little throng of friends tucked into beer and pasta on a table outside the @entity7 hospitality area			1
they clapped when their man walked over with his plate of rice and chicken			0
@entity0 had to suffice with the brief company of rapper @entity118 , their meeting making the @entity121 driver so late for his 7pm engineering debrief that technical director @entity123 had to fetch him			1
@entity6 walked briskly there , sipping his water bottle			1
the up - and - at - ‘ im attitude was obvious			2
there are several permutations but @entity0 will be assured victory if he finishes second @entity0 speaks with international artist @entity118 ( left ) behind the scenes in @entity131 @entity0 takes time out to pose for a picture with @entity118 and @entity133 ( right ) how the @entity11 course is set up @entity135 was @entity0 ’s dejection			1
‘ i do n’t know whether he puts on looking sad , ’ said @entity17			0
‘ his body language in the post-qualifying interview told me he could hardly bare to sit next to @entity6			1
‘ it ’s not dislike ; it ’s just very difficult emotionally to cope with this type of situation			0
it ’s a total psychological game			0
that ’s all it is			0
’ we should not lose sight of the fact that @entity0 remains favourite for the title			1
the maths favours him : if he finishes first or second there is nothing @entity6 can do about it , even with the absurdity of the points counting double			1
and coming in the top two should be straightforward enough so quick are their cars			0
yet the @entity160 of @entity161 and @entity162 will start third and fourth and can not be discounted			0
if @entity0 should not get cleanly through the first corner in at least second place , he is liable to be caught in the scramble behind			2
@entity17 knows the dangers of this better than most			0
for he admits he was ‘ not on full attack ’ when he led the standings going into his title decider in 1996 and was hit by @entity172 ’s @entity171			2
former world champion has questioned whether @entity0 has got his tactics clear ahead of the race @entity0 races as night falls in @entity131 in his quest to be crowned drivers ' champion for a second time @entity0 's racing style does not lend itself to driving for second place ‘ it ’s like golf , ’ said @entity17			1
‘ the hard bit comes when you get nearer the hole			0
it ’s the 50 - yard chip with a half swing			2
i am not sure @entity0 is so good at that			2
’ @entity0 is supreme as an all - out attacker but that is not his task here			1
he seems confused about what tactic to employ			0
asked how he would conduct the race , he offered a brief response : ‘ same as always			0
’ fine , but later , when asked whether he would race for second , he said : ‘ you are right it ’s not my style			0
but we will decide tomorrow			0
’ a couple of hours later , he was a touch more relaxed			0
‘ i do n’t really pay much attention to @entity6 , ’ he said			2
‘ of course @entity6 , for sure , is trying everything possible in his head to come up with some kind of way of dealing with things i guess			2
that ’s just how he deals with it			0
i just keep things to myself and do my talking on the track			0
’ @entity0 gives a thumbs up after qualifying , although having @entity161 behind him could be a concern @entity0 and @entity6 share the stage together - but who will be standing on the winner 's podium ? @entity0 takes his mercedes around the track for the final time before judgement time by late evening , the @entity226 were under investigation after the technical delegate @entity228 spotted the front wings of the cars driven by @entity231 and @entity232 , due to be fifth and sixth on the grid , were flexing illegally			1
they were relegated down the grid , so @entity235 of @entity236 moved up to sixth and now could have a say among the fray in what may be his last ever @entity14 race			2
his qualifying session was eventful : he had to go back to the pits because @entity236 had forgotten to fuel him			0
‘ are you joking ? ’ he said			0
he still beat his rival for a seat at the team next year , @entity247 , who will start 11th			2
the slowest cars on the grid were the @entity251 of @entity252 and @entity121 rookie @entity253			0
but just making it here was a triumph of sorts for the team , whose affairs are being overseen by an @entity260 called @entity261 , the administrator and a ballroom dance devotee , who now finds himself on the pit wall .			2

the @entity14 drivers ' championship will be decided at the @entity11
@entity0 leads his @entity7 team - mate @entity6 by 17 points
@entity6 starts on pole while double points mean that @entity0 must finish at least second to win the title
