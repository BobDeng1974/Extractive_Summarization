the @entity0 march on @entity2 in a mood pitched somewhere between resignation and outright dejection			1
in the circumstances , none but the most blinkered of uber - patriots would castigate the fans for losing a little faith with even some in the camp sounding as if there may be no beginning to their ambitions on saturday evening , it ’s hard to foresee anything but a handsome home victory			2
it is almost impossible to imagine this young – in parts - visiting side succeeding where so many hardened men have failed			1
oh , if ever we needed a touch of the gallus swagger that plays such a beloved part in our nation ’s sporting mythology , it is today at @entity31			2
somewhere amid the mix of technique and aggression required to stifle @entity36 , it would be awfully nice if someone from the current crop showed some inspired – maybe even swashbuckling – leadership			1
@entity41 's squad need to find a new source of inspiration if they are to triumph at @entity2 @entity44 may only turn 21 on saturday , but he has emerged as a key leader in this @entity47 squad @entity48 ( second left ) is all smiles ahead of saturday 's @entity51 clash in @entity52 @entity53 is captain , of course			1
a tidy enough scrum - half well positioned to make split - second decisions on how to use the ball , he has plenty to concern himself with			2
among the forwards , an increasing burden is falling on @entity44 , who turns 21 on saturday			1
many happy returns and all that			2
a member of @entity41 ’s ‘ leadership group ’ , the man to whom @entity53 hands his armband when replaced , the youngster is involved in calling line - outs and directing the pack			2
the risk , of course , is that the burden of responsibility dulls the energy and skills that make @entity44 such an exciting prospect			1
would it be better , perhaps , to leave him to concentrate on his own game ? @entity79 know they will need to be strong in the battle up front if they want to be in touch towards the end @entity79 hooker @entity86 leads a passing drill during @entity79 's final preparations for saturday 's game ‘ ideally , yeah , you may think that , ’ admits @entity79 assistant coach @entity91 , the former @entity92 captain adding : ‘ but i compare him to @entity95 , who i coached at a very similar age			1
‘ these kids , they want it , they demand it			2
it is a growth within them			2
and , with @entity44 , he does n’t see it as a burden			1
he wants to grow , he wants to learn			2
‘ what i ’ve seen from him , he ’s a 20 - year - old kid , i ’ve seen a huge growth in him in terms of how he handles himself within the group			2
he will use the experience of the last game , losing to @entity113			0
he is a kid who will not repeat errors			0
he learns all the time			0
what @entity79 will get out of this is just a phenomenal leader and a phenomenal character			1
’ if it ’s obviously asking a bit much for @entity44 to emerge chrysalis - like from his cocoon in time to out - think and overpower a hugely effective @entity125 pack today , this might also be a perfect opportunity for the kid – winning only his 12th cap – to provide some firm and effective direction			1
the @entity79 players have spent part of this week watching video footage of last season ’s humiliation at the hands of @entity36 , as well as dissecting the horror show against @entity113 just a fortnight ago			1
@entity79 go through their paces at @entity2 on friday - it 's an important game for them to restore pride @entity91 warned : ‘ if you go into a game just with passion and heated fervour then that lasts maybe 15 or 20 minutes			1
it is about process , the technicalities of what you are trying to do			0
‘ that ’s the thing about getting it right			0
i do n’t think we got that wrong last year , it was just systematic errors that are still in our game at the moment			0
we need to learn from them and eradicate them			0
we need to get smarter as a group			0
‘ we have a young group who need to understand that being on the wrong end of the penalty count does exert a lot of pressure on yourself			1
how do we eradicate that and make sure we are a little more disciplined in those areas ? ‘ obviously , you pull apart a game piece by piece			0
that ’s what we ’ve done with the @entity113 game			0
we obviously took a step back in that game			0
’ the last thing we wanted , heading into this penultimate @entity172 weekend , was a loss of momentum			0
@entity2 is a tough enough venue for visitors on a high , never mind those struggling for confidence			1
@entity79 coach @entity91 says @entity44 is thriving under the pressure , just as @entity95 did @entity79 fly half @entity180 ( left ) and full back @entity48 work on their kicking on friday those of us who have been making this pilgrimage , on and off , since the dying days of the amateur era can remember when @entity79 ’s miserable streak here – only four wins in history , the most ‘ recent ’ in 1983 – felt odd , given that both sides were usually closely matched			1
with each passing loss , though , the sequence of results becomes more of a reflection on the gulf between these former rivals			0
@entity36 have moved on , found new best enemies , chucked us			1
stick on the mournful @entity202 numbers and weep into your cloudy local ale … today , they * should n’t * need to do much more than bully the @entity47 forwards , a unit so effectively driven about @entity208 by their @entity210 tormentors			0
‘ the game will be based around scrummaging for penalties and driving lineouts , ’ said @entity91 , seeking no prizes for predicting the obvious			0
‘ we defended 19 driving lineouts at @entity208 last year , so we are aware of the strengths and how they want to play			0
’ they will take some stopping			0
at the end of a week when even head coach @entity41 has spoken about keeping things tight and staying in the game until the final 20 minutes , it feels like @entity79 will do well to avoid being absolutely flattened			1
ah , we ’re not going to go down that road again			0

@entity79 have *n't* beaten @entity36 at *hq* since 1983
young second row @entity44 is becoming a big leader for @entity79
visitors will need to be tough up front to avoid being *steamrollered*
