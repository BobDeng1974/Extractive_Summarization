diverting the ill - fated @entity1 around hostile @entity3 airspace would have cost the airline just $ 66 a passenger , calculations have revealed			1
the additional 45 minutes of flight time that would have been required to divert the flight - accounting for costs such as fuel , maintenance , and cabin crew - would have cost the airline between $ 15,500 and $ 18,750			1
that figure is based on direct operating costs running at up to $ 25,000 an hour for the 777 - @entity15 aircraft			1
the equation roughly comes to $ 66 per passenger , the @entity17 newspaper has reported , and aviation experts believe the cost - saving mechanism is why many airlines have opted to take cheaper , more direct routes			1
' all flight plans that are filed using these routes are now being rejected by @entity38 , ' a statement said			0
but aviation experts - including the former head of @entity50 safety - are raising questions as to why it was even open at all			2

mr @entity55 said there had been instances , such as the recent volcano eruption in @entity73 , when @entity17 airlines had chosen not to fly even though the airspace was declared safe by authorities			2
' it is up to the individual , in the case of airlines , to make that ( decision ) , ' he told the @entity82			0
he said deciding not to fly over a conflict zone would come at a commercial cost to an airline , because more fuel would be required at a time when prices are high			1
airlines are responsible for deciding to choose which flight paths to take in the case of @entity35 , @entity3 and @entity93 air traffic engineers had given directions to the flight to observe a minimum altitude of 32,000ft minimum , and it was warned that the there was ' combat actions on the territory of the @entity41 near the state border with @entity93 ' hours before it took off			2
@entity105 transport minister @entity104 said the route was a major traffic zone , confirming that its flight operators ' followed the rules '			0
he cited that many more flights - up to 400 a day - had been used along the same route			0
@entity112 denied it flew the same route taken by @entity35 , as did @entity114			2
however both have found themselves in hot water after flight - tracking software indicated that they had			0
@entity50 confirmed it did n't use that airspace and had rerouted all flights about 800km south of that region earlier this year .			0

@entity35 , a @entity15 777 - @entity15 aircraft , costs $ 25,000 an hour to run
a 45 - minute diversion would have cost @entity126 up to $ 18,750 for the full journey
operating costs include fuel , cabin crew , maintenance , insurance and ground services
