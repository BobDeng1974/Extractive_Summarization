lord @entity2 told @entity27 , which is circulated in @entity28 , that this discouraged the poor from taking risks			1
‘ people who are poorer should be prepared to take the biggest risks ; they ’ve got least to lose , ’ he said			0

lord @entity2 defended plans to put a cap on the amount of money a family can have on benefits			2
‘ the point about the benefit cap is it is making a statement about what are the limits of a welfare system , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s saying that people should not get more by living on welfare than the average person in the country gets from earnings , so it ’s a very basic statement around fairness			0
