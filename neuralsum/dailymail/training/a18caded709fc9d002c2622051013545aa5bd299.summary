@entity0 insists he is back to his best and has denied suggestions he is over the hill			1
@entity4 will look to continue his recent good form on sunday when @entity6 host bitter rivals @entity7			1
the arrival of @entity9 , and @entity11 's appointment as captain had led some to question the 31 - year - old 's place in the starting @entity15 @entity0 has denied reports he is over the hill , and insists he has plenty of years ahead of him @entity19 ( left ) placed faith in his striker and has been rewarded with goals in @entity6 's last three games the striker looked a shadow of the man who scored 29 goals in his debut year at @entity29 at the start of this campaign			1
but after scoring three goals in his last three games - including a match - winning brace against @entity37 - @entity4 believes he has reached peak form again , which is handy for @entity6 ahead of their biggest home fixture of the season			1
' when you hit 30 and you 're having a bad spell everyone say it 's because you 're 30 or 31 and things might be over for you , ' the @entity6 striker told @entity46			1
' i live a quiet life for my football and i 'm almost convinced now that i will play for many years to come at the highest level , at least that 's what i want and what i 'm aiming for			1
@entity4 ( left ) celebrates with @entity54 after scoring against @entity37 on monday the @entity56 forward is fouled by @entity37 's @entity57 at @entity58 ' the age thing is not an issue for me at all			1
' @entity4 's poor showing at the start of the season was something of a mystery given his excellent displays under @entity19 at the @entity67			1
@entity4 scored one of the goals of the tournament during the group stages when he fired a superb diving header over @entity73 during @entity75 's 5 - 1 shock win over @entity76			1
@entity4 says playing every game for the @entity56 in the @entity67 took its toll on him and he suffered as a result when the domestic season began			2
' it was a hard start to this season , ' @entity4 said			2
@entity4 held his arms out to the @entity6 faithful at @entity58 's on monday there was doubt over @entity4 's position at @entity6 after the arrival on @entity9 ( left ) and the decision to name @entity11 ( right ) as captain of the club ' it 's hard to maybe pick things up straight away after the @entity67			1
' it can be tough to really get back to your best form			0
' but over the past couple of weeks i 've been feeling very well physically			0
' i feel like i can make more runs and keep things going up until the last bit of the game			0
i feel good and i do n't think it 's a coincidence that the goals are flowing in much better now			0
' @entity4 was part of the @entity6 team that was hammered 3 - 0 by @entity7 in march			1
it was one of the most embarrassing results of last season and was one of the reasons why @entity111 was sacked two months later			0
@entity111 , unforgivably in the eyes of some @entity6 fans , said @entity7 were the favourites to win the match before kick - off , but this time it is the hosts who are being tipped for victory			2
after a run of five straight wins , @entity6 have shaken off their early - season disappointment and are now just eight points below @entity124 leaders @entity122			2
@entity125 ( right ) celebrates @entity4 's goal against @entity37 on monday night @entity4 spent time with seriously ill supporters at the club 's training complex this week but @entity130 , never happy with anything but the best , is still not satisfied with the fact that his team are third in the standings behind @entity122 and @entity135			1
' i dream for @entity135 's place or @entity122 's place , ' the @entity56 admitted , frankly			1
' ( but ) now we have to live match for match and that is the most important thing			0
' @entity130 got a little taste of the rivalry between @entity6 and @entity7 in pre-season when the two teams met in @entity147 for the final of the @entity149			0
@entity6 cook @entity150 made it clear to @entity6 's new manager just how important it was to get one over on their rivals that day even though the match was a friendly			2
' even on the tour of the @entity160 , all the members of my staff were ( talking about the rivalry with @entity7 ) , ' @entity130 said			0
' we have a cook and his name is @entity150 and when i do n't know about anything to do with @entity6 and rival clubs he shall say it			0
' he is a big @entity6 fan and i hear immediately from him			0
' @entity169 claimed on monday @entity6 and @entity7 resembled two pub teams this year while ex assistant manager @entity171 also weighed in with criticism of the club 's physio department			2
@entity130 could not care less , though			0
when asked if he or his squad had been affected by the criticism , he replied : ' no , because i do n't think somebody who is living outside the community of @entity6 can judge how we are doing			0
it is based on no facts			0
i analyse everything and it is based on no facts			0

the arrival of @entity9 cast doubt over @entity0 's place
@entity11 was *installed* as captain and some though @entity4 would lose his position in the first - team at @entity6
now , @entity4 has scored three goals in three games
the forward insists he is back to his best , claiming he will play for many years to come
