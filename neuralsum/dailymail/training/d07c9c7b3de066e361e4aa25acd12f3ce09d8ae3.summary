@entity8 leader @entity22 is expected to use those conclusions to oppose the plans in their entirety			1
he has previously insisted that he will not approve anything which threatens civil liberties			2
a party source said : ' obviously given how strongly @entity22 felt on this , we would take the recommendations of the committee very seriously			1
