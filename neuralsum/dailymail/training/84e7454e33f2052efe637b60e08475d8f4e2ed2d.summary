by @entity0 published : 12:48 est , 24 july 2013 updated : 13:00 est , 24 july 2013 under a cost - saving plan by the @entity4 , people moving into newly - built homes will not have mail delivered to their doors and will instead have to pick it up at the curb or neighborhood cluster boxes			1
the @entity4 began the change in april , and @entity12 is considering an even bolder shift that would also affect existing houses			2
it 's unclear if delivery to the door will eventually be eliminated entirely			0
' converting delivery away from door delivery to either curb line or centralized delivery would enable the @entity4 to provide service to more customers in less time , ' @entity4 spokeswoman @entity18 said tuesday			1
stand and deliver : with the @entity4 facing billions of dollars in annual losses , door - to - door delivery service could be phased out in favor of cheaper alternatives more than 30 million @entity31 homes get delivery to the door and another 50 million get mail dropped at curbside mailboxes			1
but the @entity4 , which is buckling under massive financial losses , sees savings in centralized mail delivery			2
door - to - door delivery costs the @entity4 about $ 353 per address each year			1
curbside delivery costs $ 224 , and cluster boxes cost $ 160 per address			1
with cluster boxes , mailboxes for individual addresses are grouped together at a central neighborhood location			0
the move is one of many cost - cutting steps the @entity4 is trying as it continues to plead with @entity12 for permission to overhaul its business and avert a bailout			1
the agency also proposed eliminating saturday mail delivery but was forced to back off that plan this year after lawmakers and some industries balked			0
boxes : alternatives for door - to - door delivery are shared neighborhood boxes for receiving mail , or curbside delivery the agency also proposed eliminating saturday mail delivery but was forced to back off that plan this year after lawmakers and some industries balked			1
representative @entity65 , a @entity67 @entity66 who has spearheaded @entity4 reforms , has introduced a bill that would completely do away with door delivery and require curbside or cluster boxes for existing residences with an exemption for people with disabilities			2
the legislation was to be considered on wednesday by the @entity79			0
a senior committee staffer said the legislation could realize annual savings of $ 4 billion from switching to curbside and $ 6 billion from cluster boxes			1
last year , the @entity4 lost $ 16 billion , mostly due to dwindling mail volumes and payments into a mandatory fund for its future retirees ' healthcare			2
the agency , which does not receive taxpayer funds , is under pressure to modify its business model and raise revenues or risk requiring a bailout of nearly $ 50 billion by 2017			0
the @entity4 's efforts to require cluster boxes for new residences are being received with trepidation			0
@entity101 , 25 miles north of @entity102 , recently received a letter from the local postmaster saying that all new homes would be serviced by cluster box units rather than door - to - door or curbside delivery			1
beleaguered : last year the @entity4 lost $ 16 billion , mostly due to dwindling mail most new residential construction plans have already been approved and the change would require going back to the drawing board , said @entity113 , the town 's director for community development			2
' our board supervisors who actually run the township are very concerned about this , ' he said			0
since april , residential developers can no longer choose between curbside or cluster box delivery , agency spokeswoman @entity120 said			0
the @entity4 makes that determination based on what it considers to be more effective			0
the @entity4 has also been asking shopping malls and business parks to voluntarily convert to centralized delivery .			0
