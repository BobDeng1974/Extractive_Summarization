the winter vomiting bug could be virtually wiped out by reintroducing brass taps and fittings , according to new research			1
a study has found norovirus can not survive on the metal , offering hope of a cheap and effective way of reducing the 267 million cases of acute gastroenteritis it causes each year			1
the highly infectious bug costs the @entity13 at least £ 100 million annually , with up to 3,000 people admitted to hospital each year			1
the winter vomiting bug could be virtually wiped out by reintroducing brass taps and fittings , according to new research			1
the findings suggest the bug can not survive on the metal there is no treatment or vaccine , and outbreaks require expensive cleaning , with lost working days when staff are infected adding to the burden			2
its impact is also felt beyond healthcare , with cruise ships and hotels suffering significant damage to their reputation when epidemics occur among guests			1
dr @entity36 , of the @entity37 , said : ‘ the use of antimicrobial surfaces containing copper in clinical and community environments , such as cruise ships and care facilities , could help to reduce the spread of this highly infectious and costly pathogen			1
’ the virus can be contracted from contaminated food or water , person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces , meaning those made from copper could effectively shut down one avenue of infection			2
a study designed to simulate fingertip touch of surfaces showed norovirus in room temperature was rapidly destroyed on copper and its alloys , with those containing more than 60 per cent proving particularly effective			1
the rate of destruction was initially very rapid and proportional to the copper content			2
no such effect was found on stainless steel			0
the virus can be contracted from contaminated food or water , person to person contact and contact with contaminated surfaces copper alloys have previously been shown to be effective antimicrobial surfaces against a range of bacteria and fungi			2
dr @entity36 said : ‘ copper alloys , although they provide a constant killing surface , should always be used in conjunction with regular and efficient cleaning and decontamination regimes using non-chelating reagents that could inhibit the copper ion activity			2
’ professor @entity87 added : ‘ although the virus was identified over 40 years ago , the lack of methods to assess infectivity has hampered the study of the human pathogen			0
‘ the virus can remain infectious on solid surfaces and is also resistant to many cleaning solutions			0
‘ that means it can spread to people who touch these surfaces , causing further infections and maintaining the cycle of infection			0
‘ copper surfaces , like door handles and taps , can disrupt the cycle and lower the risk of outbreaks			1
what we have found is the metal destroys the genetic material of the norovirus			1
‘ in the @entity116 , 100,000 people die each year from hospital acquired infections			2
in the @entity120 , i believe the figure is about 5,000			0
if a healthy person gets norovirus they are sick for a couple of days , and then get over it			0
but for an elderly person , it can be fatal			0
‘ if you build a hospital , a care home or a liner from scratch using copper instead of stainless steel , the cost will be about the same			1
‘ brass fittings were used in hospitals forty or fifty years ago , since when we have gone over to stainless steel			1
during this time hospital acquired infections have soared			0
is that a coincidence ? ’ earlier research has found copper fittings rapidly kill bugs on hospital wards , succeeding where other infection control measures fail			2
the highly infectious bug costs the @entity13 at least £ 100 million annually , with up to 3,000 people admitted to hospital each year in a ten week study at @entity154 , @entity155 , copper taps , toilet seats and push plates on doors all but eliminated common bugs			1
it is believed the metal ' suffocates ' germs , preventing them breathing			0
it may also stop them from feeding and destroy their dna			0
lab tests show that the metal kills off the deadly @entity173 and @entity174 superbugs			0
it also kills other dangerous germs , including the flu virus and the @entity179 food poisoning bug			0
although it is usually thought to be an expensive metal , copper is actually a similar price to stainless steel .			0

copper destroys the genetic material of norovirus and stops it breathing
the norovirus is estimated to cost the @entity13 at least £ 100 million per year
using brass taps and fittings in hospitals , care homes and on cruise ships could prevent outbreaks
