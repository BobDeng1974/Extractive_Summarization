by @entity1 reporter last updated at 10:59 am on 6th august 2011 just two weeks after the end of its historic shuttle programme , @entity2 will today launch a solar - powered spacecraft on a mission to @entity7			1
the robotic explorer @entity8 is set to become the most distant probe ever powered by the sun. the windmill - shaped craft is equipped with three tractor - trailer - size solar panels for its two billion - mile journey into the outer solar system			1
it will blast - off from @entity19 in @entity20 at 11.34am local time ( 4.34pm bst ) aboard an unmanned @entity23 rocket			1
the robotic explorer is set to become the most distant probe ever powered by the sun after the landing of shuttle @entity35 prompted waves of nostalgia around the world , the demise of that @entity2 programme is giving extra oomph to the $ 1.1billion voyage to the largest and probably oldest planet in the solar system			0
it will take @entity8 five years to reach its target , five times farther from the sun than @entity47			1
no spacecraft has ever ventured so far , powered by solar wings			0
@entity52 's solar - powered , comet - chasing @entity51 probe made it as far as the asteroid belt between the orbits of @entity55 and @entity7			1
each of @entity8 's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide , necessary given that @entity7 receives 25 times less sunlight than @entity47			1
the panels - folded for launch - emanate from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill			2
at @entity7 , nearly 500million miles from the sun , @entity8 's panels will provide 400 watts of power			1
in orbit around @entity47 , these panels would generate 35 times as much power			2
it is the first of three high - profile astronomy missions coming up for @entity2 in the next four months			2
@entity7 - a planet several @entity2 spacecraft have studied before - is so vast it could hold everything else in the solar system , minus the sun. scientists hope to learn more about planetary origins through @entity8 's exploration of the giant gas - filled planet , a body far different from rocky @entity47 and @entity55			1
@entity83 , @entity2 's director of planetary science , said : ' look at it this way - it is a new era			0
' humans plan to go beyond low - earth orbit			1
when we do that , it 's not like @entity92			0
it 's not " go where no man has gone before "			0
' plunging deeper into space will require robotic scouts first , he said			0
@entity98 , a @entity99 astrophysicist and @entity8 's principal investigator , said it 's also important for people to realise that ' @entity2 's not going out of business			1
' ' if we 're going to learn who we are and where we came from , and how @entity47 works , we 've got to keep doing these science missions , not just @entity8 , ' he said			1
environmentally - friendly : the windmill - shaped craft is equipped with three tractor - trailer - size solar panels for its two billion - mile journey into the outer solar system how it will look : each of @entity8 's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide			1
the panels - folded for launch - are here seen emanating from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill @entity2 's long - range blueprint would have astronauts reach an asteroid by 2025 and @entity47 's next - door neighbour @entity55 a decade later , although there 's still uncertainty surrounding the rockets needed for the job			0
a @entity8 success would be a good sign for future solar - powered missions of all types			1
@entity7 may be just two planets over , but it 's far enough away to be considered the outer solar system			2
it will take @entity8 five years to reach its target , five times farther from the sun than @entity47			2
no spacecraft has ever ventured so far , powered by solar wings			0
@entity52 's solar - powered , comet - chasing @entity51 probe made it as far as the asteroid belt between the orbits of @entity55 and @entity7			1
the choice of solar was a practical one , mr @entity98 said			0
no plutonium - powered generators were available to him and his @entity149 - based team nearly a decade ago , so they opted for solar panels rather than develop a new nuclear source			0
they wanted to avoid ballooning costs and possible delays connected with developing new technologies			0
he said : ' it 's nice to be green , but it was n't because we were afraid of the plutonium			0
' long journey ahead : it will take @entity8 five years to reach its target , five times farther from the sun than @entity47 passengers : three @entity169 figurines representing the @entity171 god @entity7 , his wife @entity8 and @entity167 will travel aboard the @entity8 on its journey to @entity7 indeed , @entity2 's six - wheeled , @entity174 - size @entity55 rover named @entity175 , due to launch in late november , will be powered by more than 10lbs of plutonium			1
despite safety efforts , there 's always the question of public safety if an explosion occurred			0
@entity2 's grail mission - twin spacecraft to be launched next month to @entity47 's moon - employs solar panels			0
eight robotic craft have already flown to or near @entity7 and its many moons , as far back as the 1970s - @entity2 's @entity187 , @entity167 , @entity188 , @entity189 and , most recently in 2007 , the @entity191 - bound @entity190			1
juno - named after the cloud - piercing wife of @entity7 , the @entity171 god - will go into an oval - shaped orbit around @entity7 's poles in july 2016 , after travelling 1.74billion miles			1
the craft will fly within 3,100miles of the dense cloud tops , closer than any previous spacecraft			0
any closer , and @entity8 would feel the tug of the planet 's atmosphere , which in turn would alter the spacecraft 's orbiting path and hamper its gravity experiment			2
the spinning spacecraft will circle the planet for at least a year , beaming back data that should help explain the composition of its mysterious insides			0
each orbit will last 11 days , for a total of 33 orbits covering 348million miles			2
nine instruments are on board , including @entity217 , a wide - angle colour camera , which will beam back images			0
destination : @entity7 as seen by the @entity190 spacecraft in 2007 @entity8 's most sensitive electronics are inside a titanium vault to protect against the incredibly harsh radiation surrounding the planet			1
the radiation exposure will worsen toward the end of the mission			0
' we 're basically an armoured tank going to @entity7 , mr @entity98 said			2
scientists believe @entity7 was formed from most of the leftovers of the sun 's creation			2
that 's why it is so intriguing - by identifying the planet 's contents , besides hydrogen and helium , astronomers can better explain how the solar system came to be			0
mr @entity98 said : ' we want to know that ingredient list [ for @entity7 ]			2
what we 're really after is discovering the recipe for making planets			0
' for these answers , @entity8 will study @entity7 's gravity and magnetic fields , and turbulent , cloud - socked atmosphere , which can spawn 300mph wind and hurricanes double the size of @entity47			1
the experiments will investigate the abundance of water , and oxygen , in @entity7 's atmosphere and help determine whether the planet 's core is solid or gaseous			2
once its work is done in 2017 , @entity8 will make a kamikaze dive into @entity7			1
@entity2 does n't want the spacecraft hanging around and crashing into @entity264 or other moons , possibly contaminating them for future generations of explorers .			0

@entity8 to blast - off from @entity19 at 11.34am local time ( 4.34pm bst )
it will go into orbit around @entity7 in july 2016 , after travelling 1.74bn miles
once its work is done in 2017 , it will make a kamikaze dive into @entity7
