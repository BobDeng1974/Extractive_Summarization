' these figures complement our figures			0
the figures have not surprised us because we live on this road so we know what it is like			0
' the villagers were given the gun by officers to catch speeding motorists who break the 30mph limit through their village			1
but they were so proficient with their speed gun that it was taken off them			1
they carried out 10 speeding operations on the @entity22 main road through the village clocking a total of around 200 motorists			0
over a 16 - day period , from december 3 to 18 , @entity29 undertook a speed survey on the @entity60 , @entity8			1
officers had told villagers armed with a speed gun to stop clocking drivers breaking the law - because they could n't cope with the paperwork the survey consisted of two rubber tubes being fixed across the road and connected to a survey counter that collected data including traffic flow and speed of traffic			1
members from the @entity29 team were quick to point out that this is not a ' method of speed enforcement ' but is used for data collection purposes			2

' mr @entity27 and his volunteers recently made national headlines after they were told to scale down the amount of times they conduct their speedwatch sessions as it was creating too much paperwork for police			1
