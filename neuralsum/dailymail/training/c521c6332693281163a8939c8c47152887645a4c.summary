by @entity0 and @entity1 digital currency @entity2 is built on the premise that it exists outside the control of any centralised power			1
but now it is in danger of losing this credibility because of the growing power of a group that runs some of the computers behind it			0
in recent weeks , a @entity16 - based ' mining pool ' called @entity17 has amassed nearly half of the @entity2 computing power and has briefly gone over 50 per cent			1

@entity16 - based ' mining pool ' @entity17 could , in theory , control the flow of transactions , freeze people out of the network and keep all future bitcoins for itself			1
@entity2 is a distributed peer - to - peer digital currency that functions without any central authority , such as the @entity29			2
the currency was launched in 2008 and is traded within a global network of computers			2
miners operate the computers that keep track of bitcoins and create additional coins			1
they pool their computing power to spread the financial risk of their operations			0
@entity2 can be bought with near anonymity , which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy			0
but critics say that also makes bitcoins a magnet for drug transactions , money - laundering and other illegal activities			2
the value of bitcoins has fallen six per cent in a week to around $ 600 ( £ 354 ) as the threat posed by @entity17 has become clearer , although the decline is within the range of normal fluctuations for the volatile currency			1
a bitcoin investor , @entity62 @entity61 , recently made more than half a million pounds after he forgot he bought £ 17 of currency four years			0
this means @entity17 could , in theory , control the flow of transactions , freeze people out of the network and keep all future bitcoins for itself			1
although @entity17 says it 's committed to preserving @entity2 as a trustable technology , the mere fact that one player can amass majority control could undermine trust in the currency , which is worth only what people are willing to pay for it			1

bitcoins allow people to send money over the internet without going through banks			1
this means transaction costs are low , but it also means they 're useful for illegal activities such as money laundering and drug sales			0

bitcoins have also become a target of speculators betting on a continued run - up in the currency			0
its value has grown a hundredfold over two years			0
from a technical standpoint , bitcoins are sequences of numbers , painstakingly produced by computers churning through millions of calculations			0
@entity2 transactions are recorded in a virtual public ledger , known as the blockchain			2
miners are in charge of maintaining the blockchain			0
as their computers perform the calculations to do that , the process rewards them with newly minted bitcoins			0

miners are in charge of maintaining the blockchain			0
as their computers perform the calculations to do that , the process rewards them with newly minted bitcoins a single mining computer might take years to produce a single block of coins , and there 's no way to know when that might happen			2
in pools , miners divide the bitcoins they create among themselves in proportion to the work done , providing with them with a steadier stream of income			2
the pools are n't created to threaten the trust placed in bitcoin ; it 's a side effect of the pool 's growth			0
@entity17 is controlled by a @entity156 company , @entity154 the company said in a statement monday that it wants to protect @entity2 , but it does n't want to turn away people from the pool or impose other temporary solutions to back away from the 50 per cent threshold			1
@entity17 said it 's arranging a ' round table ' meeting of key players in the @entity2 system in july to ' with the aim of discussing and negotiating collectively ways to address the decentralisation of mining as an industry			1
' @entity172 said the problem needs to be fixed in ' a very drastic fashion ; to reduce the incentive to create pools			0
that will probably be with an update to the software the underlies the system , he said			0
