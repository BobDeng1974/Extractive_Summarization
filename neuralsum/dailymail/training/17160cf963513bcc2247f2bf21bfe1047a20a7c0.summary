it may snow on @entity2 - although it will be snow composed of carbon dioxide , or ' dry ice '			1
the @entity7 's @entity6 satellite has spied a surprisingly cold region high in the planet ’s atmosphere that may be frigid enough for carbon dioxide to freeze out as ice or snow			1
the planet @entity2 is well known for its thick , carbon dioxide atmosphere and oven - hot surface , and as a result is often portrayed as @entity19 ’s inhospitable evil twin			1
but in a new analysis based on five years of observations using @entity7 ’s @entity6 , scientists have uncovered a very chilly layer at temperatures of around -175c in the atmosphere 125 km above the planet ’s surface			1
armed with information about the concentration of carbon dioxide and combined with data on atmospheric pressure at each height , scientists could then calculate the corresponding temperatures			2
' since the temperature at some heights dips below the freezing temperature of carbon dioxide , we suspect that carbon dioxide ice might form there , ' sayid @entity69 of the @entity70 and lead author of the paper			0
clouds of small carbon dioxide ice or snow particles should be very reflective , perhaps leading to brighter than normal sunlight layers in the atmosphere			2
' however , although @entity6 indeed occasionally observes very bright regions in the @entity2 atmosphere that could be explained by ice , they could also be caused by other atmospheric disturbances , so we need to be cautious , ' says dr @entity69			2
the study also found that the cold layer at the terminator is sandwiched between two comparatively warmer layers			0
' the temperature profiles on the hot dayside and cool night side at altitudes above 120 km are extremely different , so at the terminator we are in a regime of transition with effects coming from both sides			0
' the night side may be playing a greater role at one given altitude and the dayside might be playing a larger role at other altitudes			0
' @entity2 , as pictured by the @entity6 , has curious clouds in its atmosphere which may be cold enough to lead to carbon dioxide snow temperature ranges : @entity7 spotted an anomolous cold region in the clouds of @entity2 , 140km above the surface similar temperature profiles along the terminator have been derived from other @entity6 datasets , including measurements taken during the transit of @entity2 earlier this year			1
models are able to predict the observed profiles , but further confirmation will be provided by examining the role played by other atmospheric species , such as carbon monoxide , nitrogen and oxygen , which are more dominant than carbon dioxide at high altitudes			0
' the finding is very new and we still need to think about and understand what the implications will be , ' says @entity130 , @entity7 ’s @entity6 project scientist			0
' but it is special , as we do not see a similar temperature profile along the terminator in the atmospheres of @entity19 or @entity135 , which have different chemical compositions and temperature conditions			1

temperatures of -175c in high atmosphere *suggests* carbion dioxide ' snow ' on @entity2
follows recent discovery that @entity135 has *flurries* at the @entity146
planet has colder atmosphere than @entity19 - despite being closer to the sun
