by @entity0 published : 18:16 est , 16 march 2013 updated : 07:38 est , 17 march 2013 @entity1 has been moved from the harsh regime of @entity3 in @entity4 to an open jail in the @entity7 countryside			1
@entity1 and her ex-husband , disgraced former cabinet minister @entity8 , were both sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after she ‘ accepted ’ his speeding points ten years ago			1
last night , the economist told a friend : ‘ i ’m fine			2
’ she added that she was ‘ settling in ’ at @entity17 open prison near @entity18 and insisted staff were treating her very well			1
jailed : @entity1 , the ex-wife of former energy secretary @entity8 , pictured inside the window of a prison van as she was taken to @entity3 where she was moved after only four days on monday , @entity1 , 60 , who was convicted after a retrial at @entity22 , spent her first night behind bars at @entity3 , @entity25 ’s largest women ’s jail , which has a reputation as a daunting institution for first - time prisoners			1
but just four days later , after a risk assessment by @entity3 staff , she was driven 30 miles in a prison bus to the more relaxed regime of @entity17			1
the @entity33 describes the @entity35 - listed 15th century building as a ‘ pleasant mansion house overlooking the @entity37 ’ while prison inspectors say it produces ‘ unusually good outcomes ’ for the 100 women it holds			2
during her time there , @entity1 will work on the prison farm , where she will be expected to dig and weed alongside fellow prisoners – or ‘ residents ’			1
guilty : @entity1 and former cabinet minister @entity8 were both sentenced to eight months for perverting the course of justice after she ‘ accepted ’ his speeding points ten years ago they include april @entity52 , the disgraced former detective chief inspector convicted in january of corruption after attempting to sell information about the phone - hacking investigation			1
@entity52 , 53 , contacted the @entity57 to discuss @entity59 ’s decision to launch a new investigation into hacking			0
she claimed she made the call because the public should know that counter-terrorism officers were being used to investigate hacking instead of ‘ saving lives ’			0
another well - known @entity17 inmate was @entity68 , the @entity70 ’s former dresser who is serving life for stabbing to death her former lover @entity73 in 2000			1
@entity68 went on the run from @entity17 in 2009 and has now been sent to a closed prison			1
@entity1 – one of @entity77 ’s leading economists – was jailed with her former husband after jurors rejected her claim that @entity8 bullied her into accepting his penalty points in 2003 so he would not lose his driving licence			2
settling : @entity1 was moved to @entity17 open prison near @entity18 , described as a ' pleasant mansion house ' , where a friend said she was ' settling in ' although it is an open prison , @entity17 ’s dormitories and lack of privacy will still be a far cry from the £ 2 million @entity91 home she once shared with her former husband			1
last week her family raised concerns about her physical and mental state			1
her brother @entity95 said he was ‘ worried ’			0
‘ our family has no experience of going to prison , ’ he told @entity96			1
‘ physically , @entity1 is very frail			2
’ meanwhile , @entity8 remains within the bleak @entity102 walls of @entity103 in @entity91 , which is home to 1,600 hardened convicts			0
the former energy secretary ’s spirits are said to be undimmed by his first experience of imprisonment			0
his girlfriend @entity109 said : ‘ he is getting on well both with inmates and officers			0
’ @entity8 is also expected shortly to be moved to an open prison			1
provided that both he and @entity1 keep out of trouble they can be expected to be released within two months , having served just a quarter of their sentences			1
... but former inmate warns : it 's so sinister she 'll soon long to be back in her old cell my impressions of @entity17 were initially promising : a female open prison in a red - brick @entity125 deep in the @entity7 countryside with gardens designed by @entity129			1
it was certainly a world apart from @entity3 , the daunting jail for 500 offenders where i spent two years of a five - year sentence for fraud , and which is now home to @entity1 , economist ex-wife of disgraced cabinet minister @entity8			1
@entity1 has been given an eight - month sentence for perverting the course of justice after ‘ accepting ’ @entity8 ’s driving points			2
new home : @entity17 open prison near @entity18 in @entity7 , an an 15th century @entity125 manor but as a low - risk , white - collar offender she will be moved to @entity17 within the next two weeks			1
contrary to expectations , this is not a cushy number			0
while @entity3 , where you are locked up for 18 hours a day , has its own challenges , for an educated middle - class woman such as @entity1 , the regime at an open prison – where the walls are psychological , the competitive atmosphere suffocating and the rules petty and patronising – may prove unbearable			1
granted , when i arrived at @entity17 , i was astounded to be offered coffee – a luxury at @entity3 – and tobacco			1
i was no longer a prisoner , but a ‘ resident ’ , and staff called me ‘ @entity165 ’ rather than ‘ @entity166 ’			0
i could use nail varnish , had more than two pairs of shoes and glass perfume bottles – previously confiscated because they could be used as weapons			0
i could walk in the grounds until 11pm and use the telephone without asking permission			0
at ‘ @entity177 ’ ( there was an ironic sign in the prison ’s reception ) my cell had worn lino floors and steel walls painted institutional mint green			2
unbearable : the former inmate warned that a ' middle - class woman ' like @entity1 may find her new surroundings ' unbearable ' i was served sunday roast with rice and had plastic cutlery			1
now my ‘ bedroom ’ was carpeted and oak - panelled , with an original fireplace			0
we had fresh vegetables , meat and a salad bar and were allowed to eat with metal knives and forks off china plates – a luxury			0
but before long i saw the formidable downside of @entity17			2
as a working prison , ‘ residents ’ were required to graft on the farm , and in the gardens and kitchens , putting in eight hours a day for an average salary of £ 14 a week			1
it was often back - breaking , especially if , like @entity1 , you are used to sitting in an office , firing off emails			2
i regularly mucked out dozens of pigs			0
not easy : former city lawyer and ex-inmate of @entity217 said the prison stay was ' humiliating ' more humiliating were the menial roles such as cleaning toilets and taking rubbish out , for which we were paid two pence			2
we also shared rooms : i lived with a senior police officer convicted of theft , and a septuagenarian murderess approaching parole after a life sentence			0
she was said to be so determined for release that she informed on other inmates for cash			0
while ‘ grassing up ’ a fellow inmate may be considered unacceptable in television dramas , it was a culture that was almost encouraged at @entity17			1
the governors were reliant on informants and seemed overtly affected by the ‘ celebrity ’ of some residents			2
your ‘ press file ’ ( newspaper cuttings ) was used for risk assessment and to identify those with ‘ assertive tendencies ’			1
staffing , which had been limited at @entity3 , was excessive at the open prison and for the first time in my sentence i became conscious of being scrutinised , to an extent that felt obsessively intrusive			1
@entity253 listened to my telephone calls and discipline was dished out for the pettiest reasons			0
those who were allowed out on day release had to write down everything in their handbag , even including their brand of eyeliner			0
strip searches were the norm			0
thankfully , i never experienced one , but some women came back tearful and traumatised			0
we were also regularly subjected to room ‘ spins ’ , where dormitories were turned upside down by staff on the merest inkling we had contraband			0
punishments varied from loss of day release to the nuclear option : ‘ closed conditions ’			0
staff used them both , punishing residents randomly and threatening to restrict access to families , friends and children			0
@entity3 has an established reputation for violence , but i discovered a certain camaraderie between the inmates			2
that did not exist at @entity17 , where residents appeared to be in competition			1
we also faced threats of violence			0
one sunday i was typing up a witness statement – we had access to computers but not the internet – when two women serving life complained that i was typing ‘ too loudly ’ ( they could only type with one hand and had probably never heard anyone touch - typing )			0
they suggested i should leave the room or get ‘ hurt ’			0
in the past i have said that prison saved my life			0
it certainly gave me a reality check after years spent in an ivory tower in the @entity309			0
perhaps it will do the same for @entity1			2
but if her experience in open prison resembles mine , she may yet find she longs for the monotony of @entity3			1
by @entity315 lawyer and ex-inmate of @entity17			2

her family raised concerns about her physical and mental state last week
