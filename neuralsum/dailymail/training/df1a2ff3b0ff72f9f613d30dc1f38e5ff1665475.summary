appearing in front of mps on the @entity20 this afternoon , mr @entity10 slammed public ' ignorance ' of @entity22 and false allegations that his school segregated children and allowed extremism to fester			1
' there ’s been a wilful misrepresentation of things that we ’ve done and some things have been outright lies , ' he added			0
his remarks came after education watchdog @entity15 last week published a bombshell report following allegations of a @entity37 plot to radicalise @entity39 pupils in @entity41 state schools			1
mr @entity10 said : ' yes			2
' he also agreed that he had been ' victimised '			0

the teacher said he only spoke about ' time management , preparing for exams and responsibility to community and family ' , mr @entity10 said			2
his remarks came after @entity15 chief sir @entity87 , said ' a culture of fear and intimidation has taken grip ' in the schools			1
his report said head teachers had been ' marginalised or forced out of their jobs ' by hardline school governors and there was evidence of an ' organised campaign to target certain schools '			1
sir @entity87 described some of the findings as ' deeply worrying and in some ways quite shocking '			0

but the controversy has left @entity153 's government in crisis after mr @entity105 was forced to make a grovelling apology to the prime minister for undermining home secretary @entity138 , whose spin doctor had to quit for attacking the @entity105			1
the punishments were meted out after a furious mr @entity153 was compelled to intervene to stop a power struggle between home secretary mrs may and education secretary mr @entity105			2

the home secretary insisted she did not know about the decision to publish the private letter to mr @entity105			2
following the scandal @entity153 claimed extremism and division was flourishing because of a ' worrying ' failure to push @entity41 values			0
he said he wanted all school pupils to be taught about the @entity179 and ' @entity41 valies '			2

he said the @entity37 ' plot ' to bring hardline practices into @entity2 classrooms was part of a global extremist movement stretching from @entity41 to @entity193 to the @entity194			0
the former prime minister said : “ there is a very fundamental problem that we face , that may have originated in this region but has now spread across the world			0
“ that problem is extremism based on a warped and abusive view of the religion			0
it is a problem here in the region			0
it is a problem in countries like @entity209 , it ’s a problem in the @entity194			0
we can see from @entity187 and @entity186 it ’s a problem in @entity193 countries and it ’s a problem in our own society as we can see from @entity2 schools			0
” he added : “ we have to assert the strong values of religious respect and tolerance for difference			0
“ any politics that is based on a view that ‘ this is my religion and if you do n’t agree you are my enemy ’ , that is the ideology we have to attack and root out			0
” but some parents have accused @entity15 of looking for extremism			2

' now we are told we have deteriorated at an alarming rate - yet we are largely the same people , doing what we did previously			0
' i find it astounding that you are now so vehement in condemning us as negligent and derelict in our duties at best , and dangerous at worst			0
' he added : ' you have some very angry communities now who feel frightened , betrayed and let down by the way you have exploited the @entity37 hoax and demonised them			0
you have my best wishes in dealing with what has been unleashed			0
" mr @entity232 also insisted there was ' no plot to " islamise " @entity11 or to promote the violation of anyone 's human rights or to promote extremism '			1
a @entity277 spokeswoman said : ' it is right that @entity15 and the @entity277 investigated the very serious concerns raised about @entity11			1
