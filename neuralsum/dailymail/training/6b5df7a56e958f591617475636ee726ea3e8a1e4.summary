by @entity0 in @entity1 published : 19:35 est , 11 march 2014 updated : 04:46 est , 12 march 2014 @entity4 star @entity3 told @entity5 he should act with more class after being described as a ' great diver ' by the @entity9 boss			1
the @entity12 international hit back at the @entity14 boss in the wake of the @entity19 club 's 3 - 1 @entity17 victory at the @entity20 , in which @entity3 won a late penalty			1
the spot kick was saved by @entity23 , but @entity5 waded in after the match , prompting a robust response from the @entity26			1
video scroll to the bottom to see @entity3 's recent @entity30 hat - trick against @entity31 making his point : @entity3 told @entity5 to act with more class following the @entity35 's comments unimpressed : @entity9 boss @entity5 described @entity4 winger @entity3 as being a ' great diver ' down : @entity3 won a late penalty for @entity4 after going down under the challenge of @entity39 @entity3 said : ' i always say if you are a big manager then take your loss … if you win be happy , enjoy , but if you lose do n't complain about silly things			1
' it was two penalties but i do n't want to defend myself			0
' from a big manager you expect a little bit more			1
' despite @entity9 ’s spirited performance , @entity5 had complained that @entity3 , who won a penalty at the @entity50 when @entity51 was sent off , dived again in the 52nd minute after a challenge by @entity53			1
@entity5 said : ‘ he is a very good diver , but that is the way it goes			1
it is the referee - @entity3 is a fantastic player , but he does n’t need to do it			1
he gets in front of the player , he goes down			0
we spoke about this yesterday			0
if the referee gives him a yellow card he will not do it again			0
’ @entity5 remains convinced that @entity51 ’s dismissal was the reason @entity4 progressed to the quarter - finals			1
not this time : referee @entity66 waved away @entity3 's appeals during the opening stages of the second half after the @entity26 went down under the challenge of @entity53 the @entity9 chief added : ‘ we had a good chance to win the game			1
i believe that in the second half the opportunities were there but overall over the two games i feel the major decision was the one to send our keeper off			0
‘ good luck to @entity4 because they are a good side but this season they were more vulnerable			1
in the last five years we have twice played @entity83 , twice @entity4 and they are at the top of their game every time			2
‘ every time in the last two years at home we have been very harshly done by			0
away from home we have not lost for a long time in @entity90 but at home we have been caught			0
just in time : @entity93 saved @entity95 's injury - time penalty before denying the @entity19 the chance to score from the rebound @entity5 also confirmed that the club made an administrative error and were forced to name only six substitutes after realising @entity101 was ineligible			1
@entity101 was taken out of the @entity17 squad when @entity9 signed @entity103 in the january transfer window in the mistaken belief that he was registered on the ‘ b ’ list			0
@entity5 added : ‘ we discovered too late he could n’t play			1
i do n’t think it would have made a difference			0
’ error : @entity9 were forced to name only six substitutes after realising midfielder @entity101 was ineligible @entity112 put in another dreadful display , then limped out of the action at half - time			2
the @entity90 midfielder suffered a hamstring injury and looks sure to miss a series of crucial @entity120 matches , starting with sunday ’s @entity121 against @entity122			0
he was treated by @entity4 and @entity90 doctor @entity123 at the break and will have a scan on wednesday			2
@entity126 put @entity4 in front but @entity9 equalised when @entity128 rifled an effort beyond @entity130			2
@entity93 saved a late penalty from @entity95 to earn @entity9 a draw but they lost the tie 3 - 1 on aggregate			1
despair : @entity9 's @entity19 international @entity112 barely got into the game before limping off at half - time @entity112 was replaced by @entity138 at half - time and @entity5 said : ‘ he ’s out for a few weeks			2
it is a hamstring injury and it looks quite serious			0
i do n’t know how long and we hope it ’s not so bad			0
’ in the half that he was on the pitch , @entity112 had just 21 touches of the ball			0
to put that into perspective @entity150 , in the heart of @entity4 ’s midfield , had 66			2
want more ? @entity126 47 , @entity3 33 , @entity152 33			2
the exuberance has deserted him just when his team - mates are looking to the former @entity156 ace for inspiration			2
the days when he drifted in and out of games with @entity156 are behind him			0
now he just looks like a lost soul , lazy and uninterested			0
meanwhile , @entity162 target @entity160 stayed in his rich vein of form with a double as @entity166 thumped seven - times @entity17 winners @entity167 4 - 1 ( 5 - 1 on aggregate ) to secure a place in the quarter - finals			1
acrobatic : @entity162 target @entity172 gave @entity166 the perfect start by scoring a volley early on			0

@entity5 called @entity3 a ' very good diver ' after the 1 - 1 draw
@entity3 responded : ' from a big manager you expect a little bit more '
@entity26 earned @entity4 a penalty late on after a @entity39 *tackle*
but @entity93 saved the spot kick from @entity95
@entity5 remains convinced that sending off of @entity51 in the first - leg cost his side the tie after the 3 - 1 aggregate defeat
