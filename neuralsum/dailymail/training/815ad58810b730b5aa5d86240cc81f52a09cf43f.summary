by @entity0 tobacco companies have seen a dramatic profit increase in the last year despite the introduction of plain packaging legislation			1
the profits of three major @entity7 tobacco companies increased by 30 percent last year due to cigarette manufacturers raising prices before anti-smoking rules were introduced			1
according to data obtained by @entity15 , profits for @entity13 ’s three major tobacco companies have more than doubled to $ 2.2 billion over the last five years			2
while tobacco excise duty increased 24 cents per pack of 25 cigarettes , between august 2011 and february 2013 , tobacco companies increased their prices and increased their revenue			1
the three major companies – @entity34 , @entity13 and @entity35 – normally increase their prices above the rate of excise increases , but prices jumped significantly in mid- 2011 when the federal government indicated it would introduce plain packaging laws			2
data compiled by @entity42 shows that the average price of one cigarette increased by 34 cents from 43.9 cents in 2008 to 78.2 cents in 2014			0
a pack of @entity46 went from $ 16.55 in august 2011 to $ 18.75 in february 2013			0
of this $ 2.20 difference , the @entity15 reported that 44 cents was excise and gst and the remaining $ 1.56 was profit for the company			0
the increased profits are despite @entity54 data released late in june that showed cigarette sales have dropped since plain packaging became mandatory in december 2012 , with 3.4 percent fewer cigarettes sold in 2013 compared to 2012			1
these profit increases are despite the grim predictions of the tobacco industry about the effect the plain packaging laws would have on their business			0
