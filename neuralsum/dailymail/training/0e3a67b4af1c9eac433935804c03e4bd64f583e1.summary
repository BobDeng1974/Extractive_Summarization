by @entity0 published : 11:23 est , 30 october 2012 updated : 11:48 est , 30 october 2012 @entity1 today dispelled the myth that cats do n’t like water – by designing a speedboat to go with its latest car			1
it unveiled the prototype craft to showcase the towing ability of its new @entity11 estate which hit the road today and will arrive in showrooms and driveways from late november			1
@entity1 design director @entity15 explained : ' the @entity16 by @entity1 ’ showcases the design dna of the @entity19 premium luxury and sports car manufacturer in an unexpected and spectacular package			2
concept : @entity1 has designed a speedboat to showcase the towing ability of its new @entity11 estate luxury : the fibreglass hull is finished with teak decking in classic nautical style ‘ we recognise that both our existing and future customers enjoy diverse and active lifestyles			1
with the launch of the new @entity11 , we had an opportunity to create a vision of how our design philosophy might be applied to an alternative product , in which speed and beauty are also priorities			1
it follows , in so many ways , the idea of a traditional speedboat but with the sleek and fast characteristics that you would expect from a @entity1 car			2
’ to create the sleek speedboat , @entity1 consulted with specialists @entity50 , and @entity52 the @entity53 has a gel coat fibreglass hull topped with teak decking			2
this is split by a carbon fibre fin , inspired by the legendary @entity1 d - type			0
demand : the work put into the boat suggests @entity1 may consider putting the prototype into production design philosophy : both the car and the boat are aimed at customers with ' active lifestyles ' iconic : the fin behind the boat 's cockpit evokes memories of @entity1 's classic @entity73 car mr @entity15 said : ’ the front of the boat flows seamlessly into the screen and the red 2 +1 cabin follows the sporting character of @entity1 cars			1
‘ @entity1 ’s automotive heritage is also subtly recognised with fuel filler caps inspired by the first generation of the @entity84 saloon			0
a polished aluminium propeller and pop - up mooring post show how the boat could be powered and docked respectively			0
although officially spoken of as a ‘ styling exercise ’ , the degree of work put into the project suggests that @entity1 could be persuaded to build the craft if demand for it is sufficient			2
@entity53 overall length : 20 ft waterline length : 17 ft , 5in @entity96 : 6ft , 7in draft : 1ft , 3in @entity98 21 ° passengers 2 + 1 mr @entity15 said : ’ i hope our design inspires people to think about our products in a much broader sense , especially in lifestyle and enjoyment			0
i have always had a passion to create such an object and it seemed fitting that we relate this to a lifestyle vehicle such as the @entity11			0
the two sit together perfectly			0
’ the new @entity11 estate is priced from £ 31,940 for the 2.2litre 163 horse - power diesel up to £ 51,505 for the top of the range 3.0litre @entity117 diesel s with 275 horse - power , which propels it from rest to 60mph in 6.1 seconds to a top speed artificially restricted to 155mph			1
