by @entity0 published : 06:16 est , 20 september 2013 updated : 07:49 est , 20 september 2013 @entity1 has visited new paleontological hotspots to fill in evolutionary gaps of how vertebrates came to rule the @entity5 and how their evolution defines our own human bodies			2
in a new two - part documentary , rise of animals : triumph of the vertebrates , the naturalist explores the origins of the backbone by studying a tiny prehistoric animal and a living fossil living in the south of @entity19			1
sir @entity1 takes a 500 - million - year evolutionary journey to study animals including a newly discovered ‘ missing link ’ from @entity23 , a shallow water predator that swam like a fish but took its first steps on land , giant ancient animals and the famous fossil of the feathered dinosaur			1
scroll down for exclusive video sir @entity1 sets out to investigate how vertebrates managed to step out of the water for the first time and his search takes him to see fossils in the @entity37 , revealing an amazing creature called @entity39 ( a @entity41 image is pictured ) sir @entity1 looks at the story of mammals in the @entity44 of @entity23 where he examines a tiny 195 - million - year - old fossil of a @entity48 skull measuring just one centimeter belonging to one of earliest mammals discovered			1
a mocked - up skeleton of a @entity48 is pictured the series , which will air at 9pm tonight on @entity53 , uses cgi animation to bring long - dead creatures to life and tells the story of how a wide array of animals , including fish , amphibians , reptiles , birds and mammals came to flourish			1
it sees sir @entity1 filming for the first time in @entity23 , where he sees the fossils that are changing the face of palaeontology , as well as travelling to remote locations across the globe to unravel the mysterious origins of vertebrates , chart their unexpected journey out of the water and reveal the rise of mammals			1
he said : ' @entity23 has discovered rare fossils which it takes very seriously that have not yet been fully explored by the western world			2
sir @entity1 discovers fossilised creatures that would prove the only living legacy of the giant reptiles - the first feathered dinosaurs			1
a @entity41 image is pictured ' having visited @entity23 30 years ago , i wanted to return and film there to find out more about the amazing discoveries scientists have been making there over recent decades			2
' sir @entity1 was given special access to this treasure trove of new fossil evidence in @entity23 , which he uses to answer questions such as where do fingers and toes come from and why are we warm - blooded ? the programme explores the origins of verebrates by looking at primitive fish , which sees sir @entity1 joining an excavation team in the @entity105 province of @entity106 to unearth creatures entombed in an ancient seabed 525 million years ago			1
the site is considered one of the most significant discoveries of the 20th century because the creatures fossilised there have filled key gaps in the evolutionary tale and sir @entity1 reveals the origin of the backbone in the paperclip - sized ancient fish called @entity120			1
as the fight for space and resources in the ancient ocean grew , animals began to explore the land , including the vertebrates			2
sir @entity1 sets out to investigate how vertebrates managed to step out of the water for the first time and his search takes him to see fossils in the @entity37 , revealing an amazing creature called @entity39			1
the @entity39 's bones developed into four very simple limbs , allowing the freshwater predators to push themselves around in the shallows and ultimately , to take the first steps onto land			2
in these creatures are the origins of our arms , legs and articulated necks			2
sir @entity1 investigates the evolutionary innovations that spawned a pioneering group of land - dwelling reptiles , including watertight skin			1
at the @entity150 in @entity106 , he sees fossilised watertight dinosaur eggs and in the province of @entity153 in @entity154 , sir @entity1 discovers fossilised creatures that would prove the only living legacy of the giant reptiles – the first feathered dinosaurs			1
@entity1 has visited new paleontological hotspots , including @entity150 ( pictured ) to fill in evolutionary gaps of how vertebrates came to rule the @entity5 and how their evolution defines our own human bodies , in a new two - part documentary the programme explores the origins of verebrates by looking at primitive fish , which sees sir @entity1 joining an excavation team in the @entity105 province of @entity106 to unearth creatures entombed in an ancient seabed 525 million years ago , such as the paperclip - sized ancient fish , @entity120 ( pictured ) the @entity176 is @entity23 ’s @entity177 , where prehistoric creatures preserved in volcanic ash reveal a group of small , tree - living dinosaurs that evolved feathers the forefathers of modern birds			1
the feathers were used for warmth and display but flight came later			0
he said : ' there ’s no question what the number one highlight was - seeing one of these feathered dinosaurs			2
to be able to actually see it with a lens … that ’s a real privilege			0
' we met the man who identified the first feathers in dinosaurs			0
he ’s a historic figure			0
just sitting and listening and talking with him was a privilege			0
' sir @entity1 then looks at the story of mammals in the @entity44 of @entity23 where he examines a tiny 195 - million - year - old fossil of a @entity48 skull measuring just one centimeter belonging to one of earliest mammals discovered			1
at the @entity150 in @entity106 , sir @entity1 sees fossilised watertight dinosaur eggs ( pictured ) @entity23 's @entity177 revealed prehistoric creatures preserved in volcanic ash including a group of small , tree - living dinosaurs that evolved feathers the forefathers of modern birds , called @entity220			1
the feathers were used for warmth and display but flight came later			0
here sir @entity1 looks at the famous fossil he looks at how the creature evolved to have fur and warm blood and learned to hunt at night , as well as how other mammals evolved to produce milk around 160 million - years - ago			1
in @entity154 , @entity1 studies the earliest fossils yet found of the two live birth groups – the marsupials and the placentals - which make up 99 per cent of all mammals today , as well as travelling the world to see exampled of strange mammals and super-sized @entity237 , such as the @entity238 , which was over five metres tall and eight metres long			1
sir @entity1 is shown a fossilised skull that some experts believe is the earliest human known to have lived in @entity23 , 68,000 years ago , before visiting a maternity ward to explain how a child 's skull is adapted to accommodate a large brain , to complete the story of vertebrates			1
sir @entity1 said : ' evolution continually throws up new designs and some of them fit perfectly for a particular environment at a specific time in history , but in our bodies we contain some of the most amazing developments , which appeared at different times over 500 million years			1
sir @entity1 travels the world to see examples of strange mammals and super-sized @entity237 , such as the @entity238 , which was over five metres tall and eight metres long and the @entity260 - a cgi version is shown next to a human ' [ these developments appeared ] in animals as varied as the fish whose set of four limbs is the forerunner of our own arms and legs ; the amphibians which developed the ability to breathe air like us ; the reptiles who had the first water - tight skin , so they could live out of water – again like us ; and how we are the inheritors of the ability of the earliest warm blooded creatures who could be active at night			1
' i ’ll show what it is that sets us apart from other animals and makes us especially able animals			0
' the first episode of @entity1 's two - part documentary , rise of animals : triumph of the vertebrates , airs tonight at 9pm on @entity53 @entity120 : the first known common ancestor of all vertebrates			1
using its early back - bone to move around in a totally new way , this animal diversified over millions of years to create the spectacular variety of backboned creatures we see on our planet today			2
@entity304 : a newly identified ‘ missing link ’ from @entity23 ; older fish have front fins but this one has another pair of back fins , or pelvic fins , granting much more swimming stability to the owner			2
along with the jaw , sharks and skates benefited greatly from this crucial innovation			0
@entity39 : an ancient shallow water predator which is the very first vertebrate that could move its head independently of its shoulders			0
in deep water it swam like any other fish , but in the shallows it used its big muscles , robust bones and jointed fin to punt around			0
this key evolutionary step became the driving force behind one of the most spectacular events in evolutionary history : the arrival of vertebrates on land			0
@entity336 : @entity338 legs joints and stronger hips compared to their splayed out ancestors meant dinosaurs like @entity336 could take longer strides and support heavier bodies			0
@entity336 were able to support the entire weight of the body on the hind legs , like we can today			0
@entity48 : this is the earliest mammal fossil we know of which makes it the ancestor of all mammals alive today			0
this creature had a new innovation of warm - bloodedness , heightened senses powered by a growing brain which enabled it and the early mammals to operate in the dark			0
@entity363 : this small mammal is the first creature we know of that nurtured its young inside its body , in a womb			0
it is therefore part of the mammal group that we belong too , the placentals			0
the placental system evolved in @entity363 about 160 million years ago			0
@entity260 : one of the first ‘ megafauna ’ they started out as small creatures but evolved to be true giants , standing about 2 and a half metres tall			0
their skulls were massive with bony protrusions that were used for combat and defensive from predators			0
@entity1 helps to excavate a skeleton at the dinosaur excavation site in @entity150 , where the large dinosaur eggs were found			2
