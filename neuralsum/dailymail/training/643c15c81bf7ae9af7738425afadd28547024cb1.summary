by @entity0 published : 17:58 est , 9 june 2013 updated : 01:47 est , 10 june 2013 victim : april @entity3 s killer was an online child porn addict internet firms could be taken to court if child pornography is linked to more cases of sex abuse and murder			1
as @entity11 told @entity12 and other web giants to do more to remove vile images , @entity15 , his adviser on childhood , suggested failure to do so could lead to prosecution			1
‘ there ’s an interesting question if we have any more tragedies and internet activity is involved , whether there could ever be a case brought against one of these companies , ’ she told the @entity20			1
‘ i do n’t think they want to get there , so they need to step up to their responsibilities			0
’ research has suggested that more than half of those who view child abuse images go on to commit abuse themselves and concerns have also been raised over extremist material online in the wake of the @entity44 killing			1
mrs @entity15 , conservative mp for @entity45 , said the companies were ‘ starting to look culpable ’			1
‘ that is a very uncomfortable position for them to be in			0
if you are a trusted brand trying to provide family entertainment – @entity51 , for example – you do n’t want to be in that position , ’ she added			0
as well as suggesting the families of victims of criminals influenced by child porn might take court action , she said the government could examine making the transmission of such material – as well as making or possessing it – an offence			2
mr @entity11 , mrs @entity15 and culture secretary @entity64 are to tell internet giants that ‘ enough is enough ’ at a summit next week			1
@entity12 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and other firms have been summoned to a @entity72 meeting where they will be told to consider urgent measures to limit access to harmful material			0
phone companies , including @entity77 and @entity78 , are also being asked to attend the talks because of the amount of harmful material being downloaded on mobiles			2
government sources said they would include new filters to screen out ‘ offensive and unlawful ’ content , tighter controls on what is allowed on public wi - fi , and a new industry - wide protocol on how complaints are dealt with			0
ministers want warning screens to flash up telling people who attempt to access child porn sites which have been blocked that they risk breaking the law and losing their families and livelihoods			2
the prime minister said : ‘ i am sickened by the proliferation of child pornography			2
it pollutes the internet , twists minds and is quite simply a danger to children			0
‘ internet companies and search engines make their living by trawling and categorising the web			2
so i call on them to use their extraordinary technical abilities to do more to root out these disgusting images			2
‘ that is why the @entity115 lead is convening a round table of the major internet companies , and demanding that more is done			1
‘ there are encouraging signs that the industry is willing to step up , increasing funding and technical support for organisations combating child sexual abuse imagery online			1
but i want more action			0
‘ the time for excuses and blame is over – we must all work together			0
the safety of our children is at stake			0
’ mrs @entity15 claimed web firms themselves identified only around 5 per cent of illegal material which is then blocked			1
mrs @entity15 ( right ) and culture secretary @entity64 ( left ) are to tell internet companies that ‘ enough is enough ’ ‘ i find that astonishing , ’ she said			1
‘ some 1.5million people see child abuse images by accident and only 40,000 report them			1
‘ child porn is illegal but the system only works when consumers stumbling across it report it			2
imagine if that was the case in other areas – like the drugs trade for example			0
‘ if the police suddenly said it was up to us to go out and find bags of heroin before they did anything about it			0
people would n’t find that remotely acceptable			0
‘ the companies have got to do more , whether it ’s providing filters or looking more actively at content			2
’ the five main internet service providers – @entity159 , @entity160 , @entity51 , @entity161 , and @entity162 – have made a commitment to offer filters to protect all devices in the home and will make selecting internet controls an ‘ unavoidable step ’ for new customers			0
if customers choose not to engage – for example , if they just repeatedly click ‘ yes ’ to get through set - up quickly – then that will lead to protections being switched on rather than off			0
@entity173 , @entity174 ’s shadow culture secretary and deputy leader , said : ‘ the industry should be making safe search default , seeking robust age - verification systems and splash page warnings , and we should legislate if progress is not made			0
’ a @entity12 spokesman said : ‘ @entity12 has a zero - tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content			1
we are members and joint funders of the @entity186 – an independent body that searches the web for child abuse imagery and then sends us links , which we remove from our search index			1
‘ whenever we discover child abuse imagery we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities			1

@entity15 , @entity197 *'s* adviser on childhood , said failure to remove vile images could lead to prosecution
more than half of those who view child abuse images go on to commit abuse
mrs @entity15 said the companies were starting to look ' culpable '
