in the previews for @entity3 's much - anticipated interview with @entity4 , he said that his whole life has been getting him ready for this moment - and truly , the @entity7 's changing looks over the years most certainly seem to have been building up to some kind of dramatic transformation			1
since achieving fame in 1976 , when he won @entity13 gold in the men 's decathlon , @entity16 , now 65 , has notoriously undergone countless cosmetic procedures , from multiple nose jobs to the shaving down of his adam 's apple , many of which - including a revisionary face lift - have been documented as part of his well - known reality series @entity25			1
now sporting manicures and ponytails , the former @entity27 cover hunk has evolved from being the picture of @entity32 manliness into a favorite feminine topic of tabloid speculation			2
he confirmed this is the last time he will appear as @entity16 before becoming ' her ' after taking home the gold , @entity16 was a national hero - and a national heartthrob			1
muscles bulging , the athletic champ quickly became the media 's darling , and appeared in a variety of advertisements , including a @entity52 box cover , as well as many magazine covers			2
in 1982 , he famously posed shirtless on the cover of @entity27 alongside then - wife @entity55 , now 64 , epitomizing the manly ideal of a strong athlete with a hairy chest			1
but underneath that uber - masculine exterior , @entity16 confirms , he was already looking to transition from a man to a woman			1
boyhood flashback : @entity16 shows no hint of his future penchant for pony tails in his closely cropped high school yearbook photo in 1968 crossing the finish line : the former athlete has n't looked like the @entity7 who won gold , here in 1976 , for years			0
while competing in the iconic sporting event , @entity16 was known for his bulging muscles and athletic physique body hair gone : since this hairy - legged high jumper competed in @entity76 in 1976 , he has reportedly undergone numerous electrolysis treatments , and photos from the 1975 @entity79 show a much more hirsute physique he told @entity4 that in the mid- 1980s , he started hormone therapy and was undergoing electrolysis to rid himself of his ' repulsive ' facial hair , and had already gone under the knife in a bid to make himself look more like a woman			1
in 1984 , he got what his future step - daughter @entity87 would later describe as an ' ill - advised ' nose job and facelift			2
he had also noticeably begun thinning out his eyebrows , which only made him look like a better - groomed metrosexual			0
in fact , @entity16 had even been considering getting gender reassignment surgery - until , divorced from @entity55 , he began dating his future wife @entity96 , known as the matriarch - turned - momager of the @entity87 clan , and changed his mind			1
@entity102 ' 70s hunk : as an athlete who gained national recognition in the 1970s , @entity16 , shown here in 1978 , once oozed masculine sex appeal his eyes have barely changed , but @entity16 is now virtually unrecognizable as the testosterone - fueled man pictured here in 1981 1980s : the buff @entity13 hero evolved from scruffy athlete to polished celebrity as he cleaned up his hairstyle and began thinning his eyebrows			1
he is seen far right in 1985 1990s : before the end of the decade , @entity16 admitted that he had at least six procedures on his face , including nose jobs and face lifts 2000s : @entity16 's hair got shorter and his skin got smoother as keeping up with the @entity25 propelled his family to superstardom 2010s : the tv patriarch pierced his ears and grew his hair longer again as the naughties past but though he put a hold on his plans to live his life as a transgender woman , @entity16 continued to play with his appearance throughout the 1990s			1
during the first few years of his marriage to @entity96 , @entity16 's appearance remained much the same , although he would sometimes let his hair grow out a bit longer , which only served to draw more attention to the numerous cosmetic surgeries @entity16 is known to have undergone during this time			1
before the year 2000 , the former @entity7 admitted that he had undergone at least six procedures on his face , including nose jobs and face lifts			0
' if you @entity148 my name , the worst plastic surgeries of all time or whatever it is â€¦ they 've compared me to @entity146 , ' he once said			0
so in 2009 , @entity16 went under the knife again , ostensibly to ' correct ' his previous procedures , a process which was documented closely on @entity25			0
pictured here in 1982 in costume , @entity16 was still considered the height of manliness at this time , having won a gold medal and appeared on the cover of @entity27 pearly whites : @entity160 has also gotten and maintained a fantastic set of teeth , even more perfect in 2014 , right , than they were decades ago in 2009 @entity16 had a revisionary face lift			0

but as his marriage to @entity96 began to fall apart , the former star athlete gradually started revisiting his old desires to transition			1
