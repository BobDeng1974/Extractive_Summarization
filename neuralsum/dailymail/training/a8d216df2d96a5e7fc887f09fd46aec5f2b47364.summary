@entity0 believes the jury is still out on @entity3 's @entity2 as they have yet to play any of the @entity5 's leading lights			1
@entity2 sit fourth in the table after an inconsistent start of three wins , two draws and two losses , but will be heartened by their last result - a 2 - 1 win over @entity11 at @entity12			2
and while @entity0 , who spent 19 years as a player at @entity2 , believes the future is bright for his old side , he feels the coming month will prove how good @entity18 's fledgling side is compared with their rivals			1
the next month will show the true measure of @entity3 's new - look @entity2 side , says @entity0 ' i think it 's an exciting time , ' @entity0 told @entity2 's official website			1
' it 's going to be an important few weeks but exciting as well			0
we 'll find out in the next few weeks as the @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 games are all massive ones that i 'm going to be at and my thought is we 'll find out exactly [ the level ] where the team is at this season			2
' @entity2 face a trip to @entity28 in their first match after the international break before hosting runaway league leaders @entity29			2
@entity2 have had some inconsistent results so far this season including a 5 - 3 hammering at @entity30 @entity44 ( left ) vies for possession with @entity46 during @entity2 's encouraging 2 - 1 win over @entity11 @entity28 away - monday october 20 @entity48 - sunday october 26 @entity49 away - sunday november 2 @entity51 home - saturday november 8 and former @entity12 stalwart @entity0 believes @entity18 will find out the mettle of his side against teams of that calibre rather than the outfits they have faced so far			1
he continued : ' it 's going to be tough for @entity2 to get into the @entity58 and that would be a big achievement			0
at this moment in time , we 're in the places in fourth spot but we 'll find out where we 're at in the next few weeks			0
' we 've not really played anybody really strong yet			0
i know @entity11 at home could be classed as being a tough game but , in terms of really tough matches , @entity29 and @entity30 will provide a real measure of where this team is at			0

@entity2 currently sit fourth in the @entity5 table
