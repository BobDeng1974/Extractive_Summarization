@entity8 , in @entity3 ’s @entity2 , was the setting for an orgy scene in the 1978 erotic movie @entity11 , starring miss @entity6 and based on the novel by her sister @entity13			1
it is to shut because its owner is making more money from selling its branded lotions , oils and scrubs than from pampering the well - heeled			2
@entity8 , a favourite among celebrities , was opened by @entity25 choreographer @entity24 in 1977 as a present to his ballerina wife			0
it welcomes around 60,000 guests a year , offering treatments ranging in price between £ 30 and £ 330			0
but @entity32 , which now owns the spa , announced yesterday that it would be closing the flagship club to focus on selling its beauty products			1

overall the company saw ‘ good progress ’ across all four of its @entity86 beauty brands , including @entity90			2

the spa has been a favourite among @entity3 celebrities and socialites since its opening in 1977 it is being sold so the company may be able to focus more on its beauty products which have been highly successful the group assured trading in the second half remained ‘ pleasing ’ in the face of the currency challenges			1
