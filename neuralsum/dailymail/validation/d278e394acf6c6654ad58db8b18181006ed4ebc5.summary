an unusual row has broken out in @entity1 after a @entity3 monk was pictured fondling a topless worshipper 's breasts			1
the image was posted on @entity7 last week and has since been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people - many of whom were angry at the celibate monk breaking a key vow			1
but the woman in the photo has now come forward to say she was born a man , and therefore believes the monk is completely innocent			2
furore : the image of a monk fondling a worshipper 's breasts in @entity1 was seen by hundreds of thousands of people online - and prompted a debate over whether transgender people count as women in @entity23 she was interviewed by @entity1 's @entity25 , where she was quoted as saying she had undergone hormone therapy which enlarged her breasts			1
she had not undergone gender reassignment surgery or received breast implants			1
a person born in a woman 's body would never have been able to get so close to a monk in @entity3 culture and would never dream of doing so , she told the news channel			0
according to her account the monk , from a temple in @entity38 , had led a blessing ceremony at her family home in @entity42 which involved writing messages on the bodies of the faithful			1
the men reportedly had the messages inscribed on their chests , while the women had the same symbols written on their foreheads			1
because the worshipper considered it acceptable to present her gender as male , she was happy to join the rest of the men for the ritual			2
but that was not enough for many commenters online - who insisted the ritual was inappropriate no matter what the gender of the worshipper			1
identified only as @entity67 , the worshipper said she felt guilty about the reaction the photo had , saying : ' i feel that i 've damaged the monk â€™s reputation '			0
different culture : @entity1 has a tradition of kathoeys , also known as ladyboys - the definition of which varies hugely			0
kathoeys are often considered a ' third gender ' and are due to receive legal protection ( file photo ) the monk was reportedly from a temple in @entity38 's @entity86 province , where he and others follow a strict doctrine in which they avoid all contact with women			2
monks swear a vow of celibacy in order to learn more about themselves and come closer to enlightenment			0
ideas about gender have historically been more fluid than other countries in @entity1 , where there is a long tradition of kathoeys , also known as ladyboys			0
the broad term can describe effeminate men , those who dress as women , those who define themselves as women or those who have undergone a sex change			0
kathoeys are also seen by many as a third gender , not simple enough to class simply as ' male ' or ' female '			0
despite being popular in cabaret shows kathoeys have very few legal rights , and @entity1 politicians proposed earlier this year to recognise people with alternative sexualities legally for the first time			0
if approved it is thought the draft constitution will ban discrimination on the basis of gender and sexuality - putting @entity1 ahead of more than 30 @entity127 states and much of the rest of the world .			2
