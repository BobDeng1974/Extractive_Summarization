a woman who tipped the scales at almost 20st has shed nearly half her body weight after she was forced to stand during an 11 - hour flight - because she feared she was crushing the woman in the seat next to her			1
@entity6 , 43 , from @entity7 , @entity8 , was a bulky size 26 when she went on the business trip in december 2012 and struggled to fit in the plane seat			1
today she weighs in at a healthy 9st 9lb and is due to run a 10k race on sunday , when two years she would have struggled to walk half a mile , let alone run six			1
her weight loss began just under two years ago when she joined @entity21 , but did not weigh herself immediately			2
after six months of following the plan , she was 18st 6lb so estimates that when she started she was ' way over 20st ' and a size 26			1
she said that although she had always been larger she had never been happy being overweight			2
@entity6 said : ' i was never one of those people who was okay being big , it had always upset me but my head was n't in the right place to do anything about it because i had a busy working life			1
' she put her unhealthy lifestyle down to commuting to @entity34 for her job as a children 's clothes designer for @entity38 which saw her do minimal exercise			1
at her heaviest @entity6 was over 20st and a size 26 but she has now slimmed down to 9st 9lbs and is a size 10 but the turning point came for @entity6 after having to ' squeeze ' her bulky frame into seats on trains and planes			1
' i started commuting to @entity34 in august 2012 and the business trip to @entity49 was in december that year , ' she said			0
' i had been travelling out there for ten years but luckily i had always managed to upgrade or have no one in the seat next to me			2
' but this trip coming back i was in economy and it is the one that really sticks out in my memory			0
' i remember being rammed in my seat with a lady next to me			0
i felt uncomfortable not just for me but for her too			0
@entity6 says her weight was down to to commuting to @entity34 for her job as a clothes designer but after quitting her job to go freelance and work from home , @entity6 was able to exercise at lunch ' i ended up standing for the entire flight with my @entity69 in			1
' i was genuinely worried i might hurt the woman in the next seat because of my weight			0
she did n't say anything but i just did n't think it fair for her to suffer because of my size			2
' the flight attendant even offered me the seats they use for take - off and landing			0
but with the big long - haul jets there is more room to stand			0
' but even back in the @entity86 , she was fed - up of the daily humiliation of her long journeys to work			0
she said ; ' on top of this , every time i went to @entity34 i was fed up having to squeeze into train seats			0
' @entity6 made small changes to her lifestyle , such as walking around @entity34 rather than taking the @entity97 , and in january 2014 , she decided to quit her high - flying job and go freelance			1
she began working from her home which meant she could go for a walk every lunchtime			0
@entity6 took up running last march and by now was around 13st to 14st and finding it difficult to lose any more weight			1
friends were talking about the ' @entity106 to 5k ' beginners running programme so she started doing that and signed up for a 5k @entity110 , which she did last july in an impressive 40 minutes			2
after getting a taste for activity @entity6 joined a runners ' website , @entity115 , which ' changed her life ' as she was egged on by other enthusiasts			1
@entity6 added : ' the site , especially the members ' forum , gave me so many tips and so much encouragement			2
' @entity6 took part in a 5k @entity110 which she completed in just 40 minutes the designer has since completed two 10k runs last year and even ran the @entity127 half marathon in two hours and 59 seconds in february this year			1
@entity6 , who is also running the @entity129 10k run this sunday , added : ' the weight loss really picked up when i started running , it really helped with the momentum			1
' once i started training for my first 10k race last summer , the pounds really dropped off			2
' i think it was a mix of things that caused the problems , i knew my diet was n't healthy			0
' at the weekends i tended to graze the whole day through so there would n't be that many minutes when i was n't eating , it was constantly chocolate and crisps			0
' now i do n't buy any processed foods , i do n't even buy ready - made bread and i try to make everything from scratch			0
' i eat a lot more fruit and veg and try to eat health fats like nuts			0

children 's clothes designer @entity6 , 43 , weighed over 20st
