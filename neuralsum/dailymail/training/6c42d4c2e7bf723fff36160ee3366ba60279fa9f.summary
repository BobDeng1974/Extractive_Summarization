teachers are being paid to strike in defence of a militant union official bringing chaos to the education of 3,000 pupils			1
the @entity6 is reimbursing members who join a walkout today in support of @entity10			1
the militant rep was suspended after headteachers accused her of ‘ confrontation ’ , ‘ obfuscation ’ and encouraging ‘ a climate of mistrust ’			1
the @entity6 is reimbursing members who join a walkout in support of @entity10 ( above ) mrs @entity10 has organised two strikes in protest of her suspension			1
pictured : an @entity6 march earlier this year parents reacted with fury to the idea of bribes for strikes and have suggested they will bill the @entity6 for their childcare costs			1
but union leaders remain defiant , threatening longer walkouts and extending the action to more schools			0
this is despite only 50 to 60 per cent of teachers at the two comprehensives involved having voted for strike action			2
mrs @entity10 , 58 , is a full - time @entity6 rep who has not taught since 2000			1
schools across @entity42 in north @entity44 pool their funds to pay her £ 45,900 salary but many heads do not want to continue the deal , with insiders saying she has been obstructive for years			1
mrs @entity10 is leading strikes in protest , initially targeting @entity49 and @entity50 – the two schools she claims signed the letter denouncing her			1
@entity53 , whose son attends @entity50 , said : ‘ if the @entity6 are setting aside money to pay the teachers to go on strike , then what about paying the parents to sort out the childcare at the same time ? people are having to take time off work			1
’ he is spearheading a petition calling on @entity6 general secretary @entity65 to end the strikes			1
she is away on a business trip to @entity68			0
it states : ‘ we believe our children are being victimised by one @entity6 member while she battles her disciplinary hearing and suspension			1
this is damaging their education , our patience , and it is significantly damaging the reputation of the @entity6 as a whole			1
mrs @entity10 , 58 , is a full - time @entity6 rep who has not taught since 2000 but who still earns a salary of over £ 45,000 on @entity82 , the suspended mrs @entity10 describes herself as a ' teacher , union rep , psychokiller , obviously ' ‘ @entity65 , you can show some leadership and do what you can to end this strike immediately , or you can stand idly by while 3,000 pupils suffer each day of strike action , and their parents get increasingly bitter with the @entity6 as a result of one solitary member – a member who according to media reports has n’t done any teaching in 14 years			1
’ the petition has already attracted more than 50 signatures , including that of @entity99 , who said : ‘ i have two sons at @entity49 and missing their education because professional teachers can not agree is pathetic and such a bad example to young people on how the world should work			0
’ another parent , @entity107 , said : ‘ singling out two schools in a whole borough in order to pressure the council is unethical and hard to sympathise with			0
my child does not deserve this and neither do the schools			0
’ schools have a legal obligation to give union officials ‘ facility time ’ – paid leave of absence to undertake their union duties			1
but the @entity121 insists that ‘ taxpayers ’ money should not be funding trade union reps who spend little or no time actually teaching ’			2
it has published guidance which aims to ensure reps continue to teach alongside carrying out their union duties			0
talks between the @entity6 and local heads are likely to begin next week			2
@entity131 , the union ’s regional secretary for @entity44 , said : ‘ we are considering strike action for next week			1
we would be delighted if we were able to resolve the dispute and not have to call that action but there is every possibility of action there and in further schools			0
‘ we are escalating slowly because we want to minimise disruption but they need not doubt our resolve			0
‘ we ca n’t lose – we can not contemplate a situation in which an employer vetoes our representative			0
we would cease to be a free and independent union			0
‘ the fact that teachers are reimbursed for loss of pay does not lessen the difficulty for teachers of going on strike			2
‘ our members want to work with these youngsters and get the best possible results for them but at least in some of these local disputes , the union ’s resources are deployed in order to offset the loss that people would otherwise suffer			2
’ parents have started a petition calling on @entity6 general secretary @entity65 ( above ) to end the strikes in a letter to parents , @entity50 ’s headmaster @entity168 said the school was unwilling to continue funding mrs @entity10 ’s post ‘ until concerns had been addressed about aspects of the @entity6 ’s behaviour ’			1
he described today ’s two - day walkout as very disappointing , adding : ‘ we are clear that the @entity6 ( and any other trade union ) can elect who they wish to represent their members			1
’ around 150 members are thought to have taken part in the first walk - out backing mrs @entity10 last week			1
the @entity183 teacher was suspended in july over the concerns expressed by heads as well as over other allegations , including that she sent a tweet spreading news about a mayor ‘ abusing ’ her position			2
its leader @entity191 said : ‘ strike action in two @entity42 schools has already disrupted the education of our young people , and i ’m very concerned about the negative impact that further industrial action will have on students			2
‘ @entity42 has a proud history of championing trade unions and we want all teachers in the borough to continue to have access to appropriate union representation			0
mrs @entity10 was released from teaching @entity183 at @entity207 community school in @entity44 ( pictured ) to carry out ‘ staff representation ’ full time , while still picking up her annual pay of more than £ 45,000 ‘ however , the fact is that all council employees are bound by our code of conduct			1
it is our responsibility to fully investigate any alleged breaches of this code , and it ’s important that this process is allowed to run its course			0
’ teachers at another @entity42 school , @entity223 , are being balloted over strikes and a ballot is being considered at @entity226			0
the letter from local secondary heads said : ‘ secondary school headteachers have found , and continue to find , that ms @entity235 ’ preferred approach and working style is one of confrontation and obfuscation			2
‘ our combined experience is that she seeks to encourage a climate of mistrust , often involving the airing of her personal critiques of individual head teachers , rather than seeking to develop effective communication channels or relationships based on trust and openness			0
’ i ’m just an ordinary teacher , says the activist who ’s picked up £ 1/2m without who has n’t taught a class for 14 years full - time activist @entity10 , 58 , has claimed she would be ready to step in front of a class ‘ tomorrow ’ despite not teaching a lesson for 14 years @entity10 claims she would be ready to step in front of a class ‘ tomorrow ’ – despite not teaching a lesson for 14 years even though she is drawing a full teacher ’s salary			1
the 58 - year - old activist ’s critics are dubious that she would be up to the job , given all the changes in education policy and practice since she last taught			1
they believe she would require a lengthy training course to bring her up to speed – paid for by the taxpayer of course			2
however , mrs @entity10 claims to be as much of a teacher as she was when she last did the job we pay her for – at the dawn of the century			2
‘ i ’m an ordinary teacher , ’ she declared a few years ago , when questions began to be asked of her role			0
‘ most of my time ’s spent sitting next to teachers who are being sacked or disciplined			0
’ she was hired to teach @entity183 at @entity276 , but found she was spending increasing amounts of time on her union duties			0
to her delight – and many taxpayers ’ dismay – in 2000 she was released from teaching entirely , so she could become a full - time activist			1
mrs @entity10 says she is barred by her contract from talking to the @entity285 , so will not say whether she enjoys the same long holidays as normal teachers			2
she was recently known to be spending four days a week ‘ supporting @entity6 members ’ , and a fifth as a ‘ convenor ’ , co-ordinating between various teaching unions in the north @entity44 borough of @entity42			1
it is understood that her annual pay has risen from £ 35,000 to more than £ 50,000 over that time – meaning the council has paid her well over half a million pounds to not teach a single lesson			1
she had been flying under the radar until recently , when communities secretary @entity297 called for an end to the @entity300 ’s bankrolling of union officials ,			0
mrs @entity10 , who lives with husband @entity302 , 65 , and their two sons in a £ 500,000 house in north @entity44 , is mystified by her opponents , insisting that she plays a valuable role in resolving disputes in schools			1
before the launch of strikes she helped organise , she has said : ‘ i do n’t spend my time organising strikes			0
i spend my time helping people who need support and advice			2
‘ perhaps they have been assaulted by a pupil or parent , or suspended following an allegation			0
they might be facing redundancy or underperformance issues or being disciplined ... teachers are entitled to representation			0
' every local education authority gives union reps time to do their work			0
it ’s a far more cost - effective way of representing @entity6 members ... i work really hard			1
’ the staunch left - winger has opposed a raft of government reforms , such as turning schools into academies			0
she dislikes her own finances , background or property holdings being discussed – but wrote pompously to the @entity337 several years ago that @entity44 schools ’ problems are ‘ beyond the understanding of a millionaire @entity341 or privately educated @entity342 ’			2
she also intervened in 2003 , suggesting that children of failed asylum seekers should not be deported because it upsets their classmates			0
‘ our schools are penalised by serving a transient community			0
it is distressing and further destabilising for our young people to lose their friends through deportation , ’ she claimed .			0
