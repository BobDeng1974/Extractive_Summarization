the fate of @entity1 and @entity2 , two @entity4 ships lost at sea while searching for the @entity6 , has been a mystery that has baffled @entity9 historians for more than 160 years			1
the two ships , along with their captains and 129 men , were last seen sailing north of @entity14 in july 1845			1
it is believed the doomed boats became trapped in sea ice , and that the crew may even have resorted to cannibalism to stay alive , but their exact fate has remained unknown , until now			2
yesterday the @entity14 prime minister @entity21 announced that underwater drones using sonar had located one of the two boats at the bottom of the @entity27 , near @entity28 , @entity29			1
@entity14 prime minister @entity21 announced that one of two fabled @entity4 explorer ships , the @entity1 and @entity2 , that disappeared in the @entity38 more 160 years ago has been found discovery : a second image shared by @entity32 shows another side - scan			1
it is not clear which of the two ships it is , but officials said it is definitely one of the pair ill - fated voyage : both ships sailed from @entity51 to @entity52 , when they were last seen by two whaling ships			0
a note found by a later rescue mission detailed the rest of their journey , though the exact location of the wrecks remained a mystery until now mr @entity21 said it was too early to tell which of the vessels it was , but images beamed back to the surface contain enough information to confirm that it is one of the two			2
in 2008 , @entity14 announced it would search for the ships in a bid to assert its sovereignty over the passage , which was found during searches for the missing ships			1
he said : ' this is truly a historic moment for @entity14			2
this has been a great @entity14 story and mystery and the subject of scientists , historians , writers and singers so i think we really have an important day in mapping the history of our country			1
' he added : ' finding the first vessel will no doubt provide the momentum – or wind in our sails – necessary to locate its sister ship and find out even more about what happened to the @entity99 ’s crew			1
' archeologists have hailed the find as highly significant , saying it is likely that items on board are well preserved and may include the bodies of crew members or photographs of their voyage			2
@entity1 and @entity2 were heavily - armoured bomb ships , and two years before the mission to the @entity6 , they had taken an expedition captained by @entity112 to the @entity113			1
despite his experience in exploring polar waters , @entity112 turned down the latest mission , viewing it as too dangerous , so instead the command of @entity1 passed to sir @entity118 with @entity2 captained by @entity119			1
the pair departed on their ill - fated expedition from @entity51 in may 1845 , and were last seen sailing towards the @entity123 by two whaling ships in july that year			1
after that , they were never seen again			0
while no one knows for sure exactly what happened to the crew , experts believe the ships were lost in 1848 after they became locked in the ice near @entity28 and that the crews abandoned them in a hopeless bid to reach safety			1
in 1854 , an explorer by the name of @entity138 came across an @entity139 who claimed to have met the expedition , and produced a small silver plate with the engraving ‘ sir @entity144 ’			2
however , the man also told @entity138 that the explorers had resorted to cannibalism in order to stay alive			0
mission : the @entity2 and @entity1 , depicted in @entity150 in 1841 in a painting , left , were being led by @entity4 @entity38 explorer sir @entity118 , right what happened to them ? mystery still surrounds exactly what happened to the crew , who are depicted in 1847 depiction by @entity160			1
it is widely believed the expedition was troubled by thick ice and that most of the men died of starvation - although @entity139 reported at the time that some turned to cannibalism missing : @entity118 is pictured in the left picture , second row down center , along with his crew			1
right , some of the tools and equipment they took on their expedition @entity177 : another illustration shows the noonday rest of a search party led by lieutenant @entity181 as they search for sir @entity118 and his team , circa 1880 eventually an expedition to @entity28 , near to where the wreck has now been found , discovered a note written by @entity118 which revealed that the expedition camped at @entity190 between 1845 - 6 , the @entity1 and @entity2 then sailed southwards to the entrance of @entity27			1
here on september 12 , 1846 the two vessels became trapped in ice north of @entity28 , and spent two winters here between september 1846 and april 1848			1
the note says @entity118 died on 11 june 1847 , without giving a cause of death , and the command passed onto @entity119			2
abandoning their ships on april 22 , 1848 , 105 survivors led by @entity119 set out toward @entity201			0
after that , historians rely on @entity139 accounts for the fate of the men , and believe that some may have headed back to the stricken ships , which sank at different times			2
it is thought some survivors may have lived as late as 1850			0
the failure of the expedition was a huge event in @entity215 in the mid- 19th century ; @entity216 likened it to a moon landing gone wrong today			0
@entity118 's vessels are among the most sought - after prizes in marine archaeology , and @entity21 said the discovery would shed light on what happened to @entity118 's crew			1
tantalizing traces have been found over the years , including the bodies of three crewmen discovered in the 1980s			0
the bodies of two @entity215 seamen - @entity231 , 25 , and @entity233 @entity232 , 33 - were exhumed in 1986			0
an expedition uncovered the perfectly preserved remains of a petty officer , @entity237 , 20 , in an ice - filled coffin in 1984			0
@entity118 's disappearance prompted one of history 's largest and longest rescue searches , from 1848 to 1859 , which resulted in the passage 's discovery			2
the original search for the ships helped open up parts of the @entity38 for discovery back in the 1850s			0
the route runs from the @entity253 to the @entity254 through the @entity38 archipelago			0
@entity257 explorers sought the passage as a shorter route to @entity260 , but found it rendered inhospitable by ice and weather			0
search : an image from august 24 shows a crew member of the @entity267 loading an remote underwater vehicle as part of the @entity270 proud : prime minister @entity21 , right , talks about the find from the @entity273 as @entity32 's @entity274 looks on			1
@entity14 started looking for the ships in 2008 in a bid to assert its sovereignty over the @entity6 , which @entity118 's crews had been searching for @entity279 : @entity32 's @entity274 explains the find from the @entity273 during a a news conference in @entity282 on tuesday early clues : @entity284 , president of the @entity285 , holds an iron fitting from a @entity288 ship , which is regarded as the key piece of evidence that led to the discovery of the ship with the melting @entity38 ice now unlocking the shipping route @entity118 was after , @entity21 's government searched for the ship in order to stake a claim on the passage			1
sunday 's discovery came shortly after a team of archaeologists found a tiny fragment from the @entity304 expedition			0
searchers discovered an iron fitting that once helped support a boat from one of the doomed expedition 's ships in the @entity28 search area			2
the search for an @entity38 passage to @entity260 frustrated explorers for centuries , beginning with @entity317 's voyage in 1497			0
eventually it became clear that a passage did exist , but was too far north for practical use			0
@entity317 , the @entity322 - @entity4 explorer , died in 1498 while trying to find it and the shortcut eluded other famous explorers including @entity326 and @entity327			1
no sea crossing was successful until @entity329 of @entity330 completed his trip from 1903 - 1906			0
the @entity1 which sank in the @entity27 along with the @entity2 after an ill - fated expedition to find the @entity6 in may 1845 captain sir @entity118 set off from @entity51 to find the @entity6 , a rumoured trading route which @entity257 merchants hoped would cut shipping times to @entity260			1
sailing on board the @entity1 and @entity2 , along with 129 hand - picked crew and enough supplies to last seven years , @entity118 sailed north to @entity52 , between @entity340 and @entity14 , before turning into @entity123			1
in july 1845 two whaling vessels recorded spotting @entity118 and his ships as they sailed past			1
that was to be the last sighting of either vessel for nearly 160 years			0
back in @entity51 , in 1847 , after months without contact from @entity304 , another @entity38 explorer by the name of @entity112 raised the alarm , saying a search party should be sent to look for them			0
however , believing the boats had enough supplies to last another year at least , the @entity288 delayed sending a search party until 1848			0
no trace of the boats or their crews could be found , despite a £ 20,000 reward being offered for any captain who brought back news of the ill - fate expedition			2
it was n't until 1850 that a camp at @entity190 was discovered , though there was no note explaining where the boats had gone			0
later , in 1854 , explorer @entity138 came across an @entity139 who claimed to have passed the vessels as they were dragged along by their crew , and produced a silver plate with @entity375 's initials engraved on it as proof			2
however , the man also said that he had seen the crews resorting to cannibalism in order to survive , a claim that is still hotly debated			0
finally in 1857 captain @entity382 , sailing on a mission funded by @entity118 's wife , discovered the remains of a camp on @entity28 , along with a note detailing the last movements of @entity118 and his crew			1
the note , which had originally be written saying everything was going well , was penned over with a message revealing how everything had gone wrong			0
after spending the winter from 1845 - 6 at a camp on @entity190 , @entity118 sailed his ships south towards @entity27 before becoming stuck in ice north of @entity28 where the crew spent two winters between september 1846 and april 1848			1
according to the note , @entity118 died on 11 june 1847 , though no cause is given			2
the command passed to @entity119 , who waited until 22 april 1848 before taking 105 survivors and heading for the mainland			0
nothing more is known about @entity119 , or what became of the men , though it is thought that several may have returned to the ships and lived there until 1850 , before the vessels sank to the bottom of the sea .			0

@entity1 and @entity2 took @entity4 explorer sir @entity118 and 129 crew to find @entity6
ships last seen in july 1845 sailing north of @entity14 before vanishing and their fate has been a mystery ever since
@entity32 have found a wreckage in the @entity27 near @entity28 but do not know which ship it is
@entity14 began searching for the wreckages in 2008 in a bid to assert its sovereignty over the @entity6
