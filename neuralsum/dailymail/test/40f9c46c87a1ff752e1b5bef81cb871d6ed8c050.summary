@entity1 will definitely become independent one day , @entity0 vowed today as she again refused to rule out a second referendum on breaking up the @entity3			0
the @entity5 leader said the ' direction of travel ' was towards independence , as she set out her demands for her to support @entity9 if @entity10 falls short of a majority			1
but @entity12 warned of the ' frightening ' prospect of the @entity5 holding @entity10 to ransom and demanding they ditch new roads and hospitals in @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19			1
the prime minister issued a plea to @entity38 and @entity40 voters to lend their support to the @entity27 to prevent ' @entity9 , propped up by @entity0 demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes '			1
writing in the @entity46 , the @entity27 leader said : ' a vote for any of the other parties makes it harder for conservatives to get those 23 constituencies we need to form a majority government			0
' vote for @entity38 or the @entity40 and you take @entity9 and @entity0 a step closer to @entity55 — and our government , economy and country a step closer to chaos			1
' so if you are considering voting @entity38 or @entity40 , i urge you to think of the chaos of a weak @entity9 , propped up by @entity0 demanding ever more borrowing and more taxes			1
only a @entity67 vote in your local constituency will keep @entity9 and the @entity5 out and secure @entity70 's future			1
' mr @entity12 warned that with the @entity5 calling the shots , the rest of the @entity70 – @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , ' would n't get a look - in '			1
both mr @entity9 and ms @entity0 have ruled out a formal coalition , with @entity5 ministers sitting in a @entity76			0
but ms @entity0 has repeatedly offered to work with @entity10 to ' lock ' the @entity27 out of power			0
in september 's referendum , 55 per cent of people voted against independence , but since then support for the @entity5 has soared			2
latest polls suggest more than half of @entity1 plan to vote for the @entity5 , robbing @entity10 of dozens of seats north of the border			1
on @entity88 's @entity87 , ms @entity0 would only say : ' i have no plans for another referendum at this stage			0
' but she added : ' i think @entity1 will become an independent country one day			0
i think that 's the direction of travel			0
' whether there is another referendum , and whether @entity1 becomes independent is not a matter for me to decide			0
it is a matter for the @entity1 people to decide			0
' ms @entity0 tried to play down the idea that the @entity5 would attempt to cause disruption at @entity103 to further its goal of independence			2
' i 've got to persuade people that the @entity5 in the @entity107 after the election will not be any kind of disruptive force			2
we want to be constructive , to get better politics coming out of the @entity103 system			0
' as long as @entity1 remains part of the @entity103 system , it matters to people that we get good decisions out of that system , and i want the @entity5 to play a positive part in improving politics at @entity103 for people right across the @entity70			1
' but mr @entity12 warned that if @entity10 is forced to rely on the @entity5 to pass laws and budgets , @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 will pay the price			1
ms @entity0 tried to play down the idea that the @entity5 would attempt to cause disruption at @entity103 to further its goal of independence mr @entity12 warned that with the @entity5 calling ths shots , the rest of the @entity70 – @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , would n't get a look - in the prime minister , who described himself as a ' fundamental believer in the @entity70 ' , told @entity87 : ' this would be the first time on our history that a group of nationalists from one part of our country would be involved in altering the direction of the government of our country			1
i think that is a frightening prospect			0
' people thinking in their own constituencies , is that bypass going to be built , will my hospital get the money it needs ? frankly this is a group of people that would n't care about what happened in the rest of the country			0
' the rest of the @entity70 – @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , would n't get a look - in			2
' that is the prospect we face if we do n't get the majority @entity67 government that is in our reach			0
' a recent @entity167 survey showed the @entity5 has almost doubled its lead over @entity10 in a month , with 52 per cent now backing ms @entity0 with only 24 per cent of @entity1 planning to vote for mr @entity9 last week @entity10 announced plans for a freeze in rail fares , paid for by scrapping road upgrades on the @entity173 along the south coast and the @entity175 in @entity176 - both in @entity27 and @entity40 seats			1
mr @entity12 said : ' the @entity5 is a party that does n't want to come to @entity103 to contribute to a government , it wants to come to @entity103 to break up our country			1
' you have to ask yourself , if you are in a voter in @entity17 , in @entity18 or in @entity19 , would these people care at all about what happens in my life or my constituency			0
and the answer is no. ' we have already seen @entity10 cancelling important infrastructure projects , in the south of @entity17 , in the @entity192 , the @entity173 … ' they 've said we would n't go ahead with those , they 've cancelled , they 've said we do n't care about these things because they do n't matter to us politically			2
' imagine what it would be like with @entity5 mps			2

@entity5 leader says she is not planning second referendum ' at this stage '
forced to deny her mps will wreak havoc in @entity103 after the election
@entity12 warns @entity10 already punishing areas where they have no seats
@entity5 holding @entity10 to ransom means rest of @entity70 ' would n't get a look in '
@entity12 urges tactical voting from @entity38 and @entity40 to block @entity10
