by @entity0 down in the forest , something stirs			0
the tops of the pine trees sway a little in the chill , still air and from the ground , you can just hear the faint sound of rustling			2
then - as if from nowhere - he takes to the air			2
not just with a little jump or a measured step from branch to branch , but an arcing , fully - fledged , death - defying leap into thin air			1
the @entity21 ninja leaps from a log , as photographer @entity23 is on hand to capture the giant jump flying through the air , tiny red squirrel reaches heights of up to 12 - feet , launching itself through the treetops springing high above the woodland floor , the little fella jumps through the trees high in the @entity33 is it a bird ? is it a plane ? no , it is an incredible flying red squirrel is it a bird ? is it a plane ? no. it ’s the @entity44 of the @entity45 - a red squirrel who ’s simply nuts about jumping			1
his antics were captured by photographer @entity23 as part of a project to celebrate the area ’s red squirrel population , slowly re-establishing itself after decades of absence under threat of extinction			1
even among fellow red squirrels , this particular one appears to be a champion			0
the photographs capture him leaping up to 12ft from a standing start on the ground , and flying through the air with the greatest of ease as he jumps from tree to tree in the forests around @entity68			2
given that he ’s only 18 inches long at full stretch , it ’s quite a feat. were a human able to replicate it inch for inch , it would be the equivalent of jumping 40ft or hurdling a transit van			0
photographer @entity78 said : they have little fear but their secret is their hooked claws , which they can deploy to give as much grip as they need ' mr @entity23 captured the stunning series of images of the leaping red squirrel as part of a project to celebrate the area 's red squirrel population the population of red squirrels in the @entity45 is slowly re-establishing itself after decades of absence under threat of extinction not to mention landing perfectly on the other side before taking off again			1
‘ red squirrels are extremely agile , ’ mr @entity23 said			1
‘ most of my pictures are taken a few feet off the ground but they regularly jump around the tree canopy 70ft up in the air			1
' they have little fear but their secret is their hooked claws , which they can deploy to give as much grip as they need			0
’ and the @entity44 ’s @entity111 performance ? ‘ different individuals have different characters and abilities , ’ he said - other squirrels he filmed were less willing to jump so spectacularly			0
@entity116 red squirrels ( @entity118 vulgaris ) are native to the @entity119 but were almost wiped out in large parts of the country after grey squirrels were introduced in 1876 from @entity123			0
the greys carry a deadly squirrel pox virus but are immune to it ; red squirrels are not			2
hence , there are currently an estimated three million greys in the @entity130 compared to fewer than 135,000 reds , 75 per cent of which are in @entity133			0
in @entity45 , a conservation partnership has been working to build up the still - fragile population and numbers are visibly increasing			1
so could ginger ninjas eventually take over the world ? to be fair , that ’s probably a jump too far			0
but mr @entity141 and conservationists are hopeful they will be a more common sight in the future			0
@entity147 's last red squirrels might be hemmed in by their grey cousins , but they are still leaping free in their own woodlands the tiny creature leapt up to six times the height of its 18 - inch body , the equivalent of a human leaping over a @entity155			1

@entity23 captured the tiny red squirrel leaping from trees
the series of shots are part of a project to track the creatures , which were until *recently* under threat from extinction
they can leap up to 12 - feet in the air , high above the woodland floor
the pictures chart the *growing* population in the @entity45
