by @entity0 older people are more likely to have a stroke if they are suffering from depression or stress , research has found stress , hostility and depression put older people at much greater risk of suffering a stroke , a new study has warned			1
the three factors are associated with a ' significantly increased risk ' of stroke in middle - age and older adults , researchers have found			1
hostility alone more than doubled the likelihood of having a full - blown or ' mini ' stroke , also known as a transient ischaemic attack ( @entity22 ) , a study claims			1
chronic stress increased stroke and @entity22 risk by 59 per cent , and depressive symptoms by 86 per cent			1
scientists used questionnaires to assess chronic stress , depressive symptoms , anger and hostility in 6,700 men and women aged 45 to 84			2
over a period of eight - and - a - half to 11 years , a total of 147 strokes and 48 @entity38 occurred within the group			0
the only trait not linked to a higher risk of stroke was anger , despite the strong association with hostility			2
the researchers defined hostility as a ' negative way of viewing the world ' and measured it by assessing participants ’ cynicism			0
study leader dr @entity53 , from the @entity54 in the @entity55 , said : ' there ’s such a focus on traditional risk factors - cholesterol levels , blood pressure , smoking and so forth - and those are all very important , but studies like this one show that psychological characteristics are equally important			1
' given our ageing population , it ’s important to consider these other factors that might play a role in disease risk			2
' stroke is a disease of the elderly predominantly , and so learning more about things that can influence risk for stroke as people age is important			1
' the findings are published in the @entity81 journal @entity71			0
chronic stress was measured in five different areas relating to personal health , the health problems of close others , work or the ability to do a job , relationships and finances			0
scientists used questionnaires to assess chronic stress , depressive symptoms , anger and hostility in 6,700 men and women aged 45 to 84 based on participants ’ answers , scores were allocated for depressive symptoms and anger levels			2
the associations remained significant after accounting for age , race , sex , lifestyle and other factors known to influence stroke risk			1
dr @entity111 added : ' one thing we did n’t assess is coping strategies			0
' if someone is experiencing depressive symptoms or feeling a lot of stress or hostility , we do n’t know how they manage those , so it ’s possible that positive coping strategies could ameliorate some of these associations or effects			0
' we did not inquire about coping			0
i would say that ’s one of the tasks for future studies			0

depression and stress associated with ' significantly increased risk ' of stroke
factors could increase the risk for older people and middle - aged adults
' @entity142 ' can more than double the likelihood of having a stroke , say experts
the research was *carried* out at the @entity54 in the @entity55
