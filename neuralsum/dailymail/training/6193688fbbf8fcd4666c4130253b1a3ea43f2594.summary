reporters did n't want to hear about changes to @entity2 or the @entity3 on wednesday , opting instead to kick off @entity5 ' first press conference of 2015 with questions about the white supremacy scandal that threatens to swallow majority whip @entity9 whole			1
house speaker @entity10 introduced a parade of @entity13 luminaries to push his legislative agenda but the event quickly devolved into his worst nightmare before he offered his own defense of his third - in - command			1
' i know what 's in his heart , ' the speaker said			2
' he 's a decent , honest person who made a mistake			1
we 've all made mistakes			2
it was his first confrontation with reporters over the damaging revelations since @entity9 apologized in a statement for the speech , which he characterized as an unintentional lapse in a frayed and inconsistent vetting process			2
@entity9 said after the story broke that when he was a more lowly state legislator he did n't have adequate staff to screen groups that asked him to deliver remarks			0
and besides , he added , his practice was to speak to any group of constituents who would hear his message against an unpopular tax proposal that was made law and later repealed			2
@entity10 himself said wednesday that when he was in the @entity60 legislature , ' i had a half of a staffer			0
you get asked to speak to a lot of groups			0
' @entity9 spoke for himself			0
' i reject any form of bigotry , bigotry of all kinds , ' he said in response to a question about the @entity72 ( @entity72 ) , a group with strong ties to the infamous @entity77 @entity76 founder @entity75			1
@entity9 referred reporters to his statement last month , in which he said the speech he gave was ' a mistake i regret			1
' ' i think that 's where the story ends , ' he insisted			0
@entity5 @entity13 leaders have yet to address a story line that emerged shortly after @entity9 confirmed that he had delivered the tax speech in 2002			1
@entity89 , the former @entity90 aide who reserved the hotel hospitality suite where he spoke , said the meeting was for a civic association , not @entity72			0
the two meetings were held in the same room , he said , hours apart			0
@entity9 's speech , @entity89 recalled in an interview with @entity98 , was sandwiched in between a @entity100 presentation about cpr and a sheriff 's department talk about local crime watch programs			2
feeding frenzy : the first three questions – half of those @entity10 's team took – were about the allegations of racism lodged against @entity111 but the @entity5 has seized on the event to cast doubt on @entity13 ' ability to run both houses of @entity37 with @entity9 as part of the leadership structure			1
' who they choose to serve in their leadership says a lot about who they are and what their values should be , ' @entity5 press secretary @entity118 said on monday			0
@entity118 made special mention of a 20 - year - old comment attributed to @entity9 , who reportedly told a constituent that he was ' @entity75 without the baggage			1
' @entity9 did not directly deny making that claim , but emphasized that ' i reject bigotry of all kinds			0
