@entity0 : from revolutionary to emperor by @entity2 the roman emperor augustus surely has a good claim to be considered the greatest leader in history			1
at 18 , he made himself undisputed ruler of @entity8 and the most powerful man on @entity10 , governing an empire that was not only mostly peaceful , but prosperous under him			1
not bad for a sickly teenager , whose eyes were described as being as widely spaced a horse ’s , and whose limbs were marked by scaly skin			0
at 18 @entity0 made himself undisputed ruler of @entity8 and the most powerful man on @entity10 his rise to power followed years of bloody civil war			1
not everyone supported @entity0 ’s rule , but most agreed it was preferable to continuing slaughter			1
@entity24 @entity23 hailed him as the son of a god and father of his country			0
in private , as ancient historians such as @entity31 record , they identified more pungent qualities , among them his taste for married women and a vicious temper			1
@entity2 ’s preferred description of @entity0 is ‘ warlord ’			1
ambition , political acumen , sleight of hand and plenty of good fortune smoothed @entity0 ’s path to supremacy			1
for almost six decades he dominated the violent world of @entity23 politics			0
underpinning everything was military support on an unprecedented scale			0
despite a dodgy track record on the battlefield — he had a knack of falling ill and missing the worst of the fighting — @entity0 was a military dictator			2
he worked hard to keep @entity8 ’s armies on his side			1
@entity0 was as slippery as any politician			2
he devised an approach to government that was transformed into a one - man tyranny by his successors , including the lunatic @entity63			0
under @entity0 ’s heirs , the @entity64 had all the trappings of monarchy , despite @entity0 claiming that he had restored the @entity68 , a system intended to prevent excessive power on the part of any individual			1
@entity2 ’s is not a radical reinterpretation of @entity0			2
he presents a man who , in his youth , was ruthless , cruel and occasionally vindictive			0
with age came mellowness and , for much of the time , a velvet glove disguising the iron fist			0
for good measure , he commissioned splendid buildings , restored temples , improved the road system and struggled to clean up elections			0
he also did his best to improve @entity8 ’s morals , despite the many affairs that punctuated his 50 - year marriage to @entity88 , whom he stole from a fellow senator			2
he even banished his own daughter and granddaughter on charges of adultery			0
ambition , political acumen , sleight of hand and plenty of good fortune smoothed @entity0 ’s path to supremacy @entity2 ’s aim is to examine the roman emperor as if he were the subject of a modern political biography			1
at times , @entity0 disappears from view , victim of the author ’s relish for the details of warfare			2
after 2,000 years , and with patchy source material , it is impossible to identify @entity0 ’s motives clearly , beyond concluding that he was spectacularly determined and a workaholic			1
@entity2 ’s mastery of his material is assured			0
he is undoubtedly correct to demolish many of the more colourful rumours reported by ancient historians			0
@entity31 , for example , claimed that @entity0 tore out a rival ’s eyes with his own hands on a misplaced suspicion that the man intended to stab him , and that he once offered to have sex with an older politician in return for 3,000 gold pieces			1
as a result , @entity2 ’s @entity0 is a more elusive , less likeable character			2
@entity131 is author of @entity132 ( @entity133 )			0
