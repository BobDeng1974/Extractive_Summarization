by @entity0 published : 13:04 est , 10 june 2013 updated : 13:04 est , 10 june 2013 an archaeological row over when exactly mankind began leaving @entity3 has intensified with a new study dismissing one of the main theories			1
new genetic and archaeological findings suggest mankind only left @entity3 within the last 60,000 years rather than up to 120,000 years ago , according to a study			1
the two main theories for the timing of exodus put it either side of the @entity14 of about 74,000 years ago but one of them , according to the study , is worthless			2
@entity17 was formed from a volcanic eruption 74,000 years ago but did mankind leave @entity3 before it or afterwards ? the eruption forms the fault - line between scientific theories on when people started colonising @entity24			1
in an unusually strong scientific put - down , archaeologists involved in the latest study claim the theory that @entity29 left @entity3 the before the volcanic eruption has ' no evidence '			1
genetic evidence , they say , only backs up the idea that man left @entity3 within the last 60,000 years			1
had colonisation of @entity24 and other parts of the world taken place much earlier , there would have been genetic traces surviving today			0
the ' lack of any discernable evidence ' of such genetic traces , said the researchers , ' poses a final obstacle to the hypothesis of an early , @entity48 modern human colonization of @entity49 '			0
stone tools and symbols like perforated beads and artistic engravings that had previously been used to support the @entity55 theory actually date from 25,000 years after the eruption , they said			0
prof sir @entity57 , from the @entity58 , and other researchers presented their findings in the journal @entity62			0
' we find no evidence , either genetic or archaeological , for a very early modern human colonization of @entity49 , before the @entity17 eruption , ' they concluded			0
a view of @entity17 which is 55 miles long and up to 1,600 feet deep			0
it was formed by a supervolcano 74,000 years ago			2
ash from the volcano has been found thousands of miles away may have caused a nuclear winter			0
' all of the available evidence supports a much later colonization beginning 50 â€“ 55 ka [ 50 - 55,000 years ago			1
the eruption of @entity17 in @entity78 74,000 years ago is the biggest for the last two million years			2
it spewed out ten billion tons of ash and left a huge hole in the ground which today forms @entity17 - fifty - five miles long , twenty miles wide and over 1600 feet deep			0
at the centre is @entity84 - a popular tourist spot and the largest island - within - an - island in the world			0
' we see no reason to believe that the initial modern human colonization of @entity24 and @entity24 was distinct from the process that is now well documented for effectively all of the other regions of @entity94 from 60 ka [ 60,000 years ago ] onward			1
' they said in their summary : ' we show here this " @entity55 " dispersal model is in serious conflict with both the most recent genetic evidence from both @entity3 and @entity24 and the archaeological evidence from @entity49 sites			2
' we present an alternative model based on a combination of genetic analyses and recent archaeological evidence from @entity49 and @entity3			2
' these data support a coastally oriented dispersal of modern humans from eastern @entity3 to southern @entity24 about 60,000 to 50,000 years ago			1

researchers dismiss alternative @entity3 theory has having ' no evidence '
latest findings suggest mankind left the *continent* less than 60,000 years ago
