a football coach who made an ignorant statement during a recent interview got the ultimate payback at a news conference this week			2
@entity6 head coach @entity5 was appearing on a local @entity6 radio station earlier this week when he referred to @entity9 quarterback @entity8 as a ' midget			1
' and while the rookie footballer , who claims to be 6 ' 0 " said he had no problem with @entity5 ' comment , even calling the comment ' funny , ' a @entity9 news station found the perfect way to make @entity5 acknowledge his statement - by sending a little person to interview him			1
before he could start asking them though , @entity5 did take a moment to apologize for his ' midget ' comment			0
' it was thoughtless on my part to use the word i did , and not excusable , and i greatly regret it , ' he told the assembled reporters			0
then @entity30 got to his first question for @entity5 ; ' based on the height difference of a play like @entity8 how has your defensive approach changed for sunday â€™s game ? ' this was a reference to the fact that @entity8 is a few inches shorter than @entity56 , the @entity9 normal starter , who he is replacing in sunday 's game			1
@entity5 , undaunted , gave the question a long and thorough response			0
not bothered : @entity30 ( above in blue in a photo posted by @entity61 on @entity62 ) said he was not offended by @entity5 ' comment @entity30 then asked ; ' @entity56 likes to stand tall in the pocket and @entity8 likes to move around			2
what challenges does that present to your defense ? ' @entity5 again had a nice long response			0
for his part , @entity30 said he took no offense with @entity5 ' comment , and feels the coach has apologized enough			0
@entity8 will have a shot at getting the last word however when his @entity9 take on @entity5 ' @entity6 this sunday in @entity9 .			1

@entity6 head coach @entity5 was *grilled* by a little person at a news conference on wednesday
this came just days after @entity5 called @entity9 quarterback @entity79 a ' midget '
@entity5 apologized for his comment , and both @entity8 and the little person who interviewed him say they were not offended
@entity8 , who claims to be 6 ' 0 " , will play against @entity5 and the @entity6 on sunday in @entity9
