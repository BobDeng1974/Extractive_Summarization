the ancient city of @entity1 was built to align with the rising sun on the day of @entity4 's birth , a new study suggests			1
the @entity7 empire builder , who conquered a swathe of territory stretching from @entity11 to @entity12 in the west , to as far as the @entity14 in the east , founded the city on @entity12 's @entity18 coast in @entity19			1
now research shows that on @entity4 's birthday the main east - west thoroughfare of the ancient city is ' in almost perfect alignment ' with the rising sun of the fourth century			1
an engraving imagines the @entity27 of @entity1 : new research shows the city , founded by @entity4 , was built to align with the sun on the day of the empire builder 's birth @entity35 , an archaeoastronomer at the @entity37 , hopes his results could help researchers in the hunt for @entity4 's tomb , the location of which has been lost for over 2,000 years			1
these days a modern city home to 4million people , @entity1 was in ancient times hugely prosperous and home to the @entity27 , one of the @entity47 , as well as the @entity48			0
however a study of the ancient city 's main thoroughfare , called the @entity52 , shows it was not laid out according to topography - sitting , as it does , slightly off parallel with the @entity18 coast			1
professor @entity35 and his colleague @entity55 used a computer to plot the sun 's position in the fourth century @entity64 because the earth 's orbit varies , the path of the sun through the sky changes changes over time			1
still prosperous : the modern city of @entity1 on @entity12 's @entity18 coast , which is these days home to 4million people @entity4 , commonly known as @entity4 , was a king of @entity69 , a state in northern ancient @entity11			1
born in @entity70 in 356 @entity19 , @entity4 was tutored by @entity71 until the age of 16			2
by the age of thirty , he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world , stretching from the @entity77 to the @entity78			0
he was undefeated in battle and is considered one of history 's most successful commanders			0
@entity4 died in @entity83 in 323 @entity19 , without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of @entity87			2
in the years following his death , a series of civil wars tore his empire apart , resulting in several states ruled by @entity4 's surviving generals and heirs			2
after his death he became a near - legendary figure			0
he has long been the measure against which military leaders compare themselves and military academies throughout the world still teach his tactics			0
@entity4 was born on july 20 , @entity101 , by the @entity102 - which differs from our modern calendar because it omits leap years , which keep our calendar synchronised with the astronomical year			2
the researchers found that on that day in the fourth century @entity19 the sun rose in near perfect alignment with the @entity52 , at a spot less than half a degree off the road 's route			1
a second star would have reinforced the effect			0
@entity117 - the so - called ' @entity115 ' which is the brightest in the constellation of @entity119 , found near the lion 's head - also rose in near perfect alignment with the road			1
professor @entity35 told @entity123 that basing architecture on astronomy was common in the ancient world			0
the @entity127 of @entity128 is in near - perfect alignment with the points of the compass , for example			0
the @entity12 , who @entity4 conquered and who were admired in the ancient world for their science and maths , had long associated the sun god @entity137 with their own rulers , the pharaohs			0
the researchers say @entity1 was the prototype of a series of @entity143 towns designed as ‘ king 's towns ’ that aimed to make explicit the divine power of their founder			0
' aligning the city to the sun in the day of birth of @entity4 was a way to embody in the architectural project an explicit reference to his power , ' professor @entity35 told @entity123 , adding that the @entity155 would have only added to the mystique			1
professor @entity35 and ms @entity55 are now examining other cities founded by @entity4 and his successors to see if they maintain the link to the sun 's route across the sky			2
their research was reported online in the @entity166 .			0

in the fourth century @entity19 the city 's main road would have also lined up with @entity117 , the ' @entity155 ' which is the brightest in the constellation of @entity119
@entity173 researchers used computers to *simulate* the movements of the *heavens* in the time @entity4 was alive
