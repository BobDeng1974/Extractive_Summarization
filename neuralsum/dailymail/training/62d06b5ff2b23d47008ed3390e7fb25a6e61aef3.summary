the full extent of the @entity2 ’s campaign of bullying and intimidation against senior managers during the bitter @entity7 oil refinery dispute is revealed today			1
in a disturbing echo of the union militancy of the 1970s and 80s , @entity2 leaders deployed a dirty tricks squad to personally target and humiliate executives of the @entity14 chemical company and their families			1
the sinister unit – known as the ‘ leverage team ’ – sent mobs of protesters to the homes of senior figures in the firm			1
one director last night said he had feared for the safety of his wife and his two young children after 30 unite protesters descended on his drive during the school holidays			0
bullying : the @entity30 revealed how @entity2 thugs targeted the families and neighbours of staff at the @entity7 petrochemical plant , pictured , in @entity36 during strike action last month police were called after the group approached his neighbours , telling them he was ‘ evil ’ in an apparent attempt to coerce him into giving in to their demands			1
the daughter of another company boss had ‘ wanted ’ posters denouncing her father posted through her front door hundreds of miles away in @entity53			1
the union agreed to call off the leverage team only as part of the settlement of the dispute			2
yesterday , an unrepentant @entity2 spokesman said such activities were ‘ legitimate in the context of an industrial dispute ’ , adding that ‘ bad employers should have nowhere to hide ’			1
@entity64 , the @entity2 organiser at the heart of the dispute details of the bully - boy tactics were revealed yesterday as @entity72 branded @entity64 , the @entity2 organiser at the heart of the dispute , a ‘ rogue trade unionist ’ whose behaviour nearly sank the plant			1
@entity14 threatened to close the @entity7 plant after mr @entity64 and @entity2 refused a new pay and pension package designed to save the business			1
unite general secretary @entity81 brought the dispute to crisis point by launching strike action			2
unite finally caved in last friday and mr @entity64 resigned on monday after being told he would be fired for spending a quarter of his working hours on @entity87 business			1
mr @entity64 was also chairman of the @entity88 where he had become embroiled in a @entity87 vote - rigging scandal			1
the prime minister said of mr @entity64 : ‘ frankly , we have a real problem with a rogue trade unionist at @entity7 who nearly brought the @entity36 petrochemical industry to its knees			1
’ one @entity7 boss , who as asked not to be named for fear of reprisals , called the police after 25 @entity2 members working for the union ’s leverage team protested on his driveway with flags , banners and an inflatable rat for about 90 minutes on october 18			1
the director was called by his wife , who was out with her children and had been phoned by a friend to say a mob had arrived on their doorstep			0
he rushed to the scene said he was overcome with ‘ bloody anger ’ when he saw they had targeted him			1
‘ it was a mob , a threatening mob , ’ he said			2
children as young as seven who were playing on the street were coaxed into joining the mob			0
‘ they were trying to humiliate me , ’ the director said			2
‘ trying to portray me as a nasty boss , a nasty capitalist			2
to portray me as someone evil			0
their intent was to have my neighbours thinking , gosh , what sort of a guy do we have living there			0
unite members protest outside the home of an @entity14 director over the @entity7 dispute ‘ it was just despicable to approach kids and try to introduce them to a demonstration against one of their neighbours			1
it ’s hard to find words to describe the lunacy of their behaviour			2
’ police were called and interviewed the director and his neighbours at length , saying they would search out the members of the group on suspicion of being in breach of the peace			0
officers decided not to press charges			0
the director added : ‘ their intent was to gain concessions			0
but taking it to someone ’s home , to someone ’s drive , during the school holidays , is way over the line			0
’ unite admit the use of ‘ leverage ’ on their website and claim it has helped secure a number of ‘ landmark victories ’			2
it says : ‘ leverage is a process whereby the union commits resources and time to making all interested parties aware of the treatment received by @entity2 members at the hands of an employer			1
‘ those interested parties may include shareholders of the employer ; competitors of the employer ; communities within which the employer operates ; customers of the employer and the market place of the employer			0
‘ we ask all interested parties to make moral and ethical decisions about their future relations with an employer who we believe is acting immorally			0
‘ @entity2 will make sure all are aware of the true facts behind an employer ’s poor treatment of our members			1
‘ we will ask those who object to the behaviour of an immoral employer to conduct in lawful protest against the actions of the employer			2
‘ where @entity2 members are involved in such lawful protest the union will use its best endeavours to ensure such members are aware of their rights of lawful protest			1
leverage is not a call for unofficial action			0
‘ leverage is about the democratic right of the union to ensure that immoral employers can not hide behind veils of secrecy and must conduct their business in an open and transparent fashion and accept the consequences of the moral judgements that may follow			2
‘ it is in no way a replacement for collective strength			0
the development of industrial power remains vital if workers are to have the ability to win long - term			0
‘ leverage does not offer a solution that excludes the critical need to organise workers			0
‘ @entity232 has secured landmark victories including : ‘ @entity236 – defeat of de-recognition at the cac			0
‘ @entity240 – defeat of the so - called @entity240 – construction industry ‘ majors ’ – who were seeking to rip up industry agreements and impose inferior contracts on thousands of workers			2
‘ @entity247 – a supplementary payment gained following a dispute over additional workload caused by @entity252 ’s hosting of the @entity253			2
’ the director and his wife now fear for the safety of their children , who are both under ten			0
‘ it had quite an impact on my kids , ’ he said			2
‘ my wife is very concerned that they could turn up at any time again			0
they know where i live			0
it ’s in the back of my mind			0
’ leaflets denouncing company owner @entity269 were also posted through the doors of homes in the town where he lives			0
@entity275 protests were also held outside dozens of businesses which trade with @entity14 , including their bankers @entity278 and customers @entity281 ’s and @entity282 , in a effort to pressurise them to cut their ties with the firm			1
another @entity14 director said : ‘ they have send flying squads of protesters to dozens of businesses we have links with			1
the put leaflets through the door of pretty much every house in @entity296 where we have our headquarters			0
my daughter received a poster explaining what a terrible person i am			0
‘ this behaviour smacks of totalitarianism			2
the way they have been behaving is frankly insane			0
’ the @entity30 has seen an email , sent from mr @entity64 ’ email account last wednesday , acknowledging that the @entity232 unit went on the attack			1
the message , written by mr @entity64 ’ fellow unite convenor @entity312 to @entity313 and @entity314 , the two @entity14 negotiators , offered the company a deal			1
in addition to accepting the ‘ survival plan ’ and ‘ pensions proposals ’ , the @entity2 point man also says union bosses will ‘ ensure withdrawal of leverage strategy ’			1
on @entity2 ’s website , the union boasts that it uses ‘ leverage ’ to put pressure on ‘ shareholders of the employer , competitors of the employer , communities within which the employer operates ’ and ‘ customers of the employer ’			1
‘ leverage is about the democratic right of the @entity275 to ensure that immoral employers can not hide behind veils of secrecy			0
’ the behaviour of the leverage team appears not to violate union laws banning secondary picketing since protests are allowed if they do not prevent employers of the firms they targeted from going to work			2
but the @entity350 last night branded the revelations ‘ extremely sinister ’ and called on @entity352 to reopen @entity87 ’s inquiry into the activities of @entity2			1
a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ all the activities referred to are both legal and legitimate in the context of an industrial dispute			1
bad employers should have nowhere to hide			0
‘ of course all campaigning in the context of the @entity14 dispute has now ended			1
‘ however for the workers and their union to be described as “ bullies ” is beyond satire			0
’ last night @entity81 denounced mr @entity72 after he used @entity367 to criticise mr @entity64			1
‘ the prime minister ’s conduct today was disgraceful , ’ said mr @entity81			1
‘ his rush to smear a good and honourable man will appal decent - thinking people			0
he should apologise at once			0
