a borders row erupted last night after a @entity2 killer was named the prime suspect over missing @entity4			1
@entity5 , 41 , was jailed in 1998 for battering his wife to death in his homeland			1
but after just seven years inside he was free to move here without immigration officials or police knowing of his murderous past			1
and he is now at the centre of an international manhunt in the case of 14 - year - old @entity4 who vanished three weeks ago in west @entity18			1
‘ it ’s completely unacceptable for a convicted murderer from another country to ever be allowed to stay in this country , ’ said @entity28 backbencher @entity27			0
‘ i have no confidence in our border controls as far as i can see – they must be the laughing stock of the world now			0
‘ police are never going to be able to keep tabs on the criminal records of people with @entity44 passports – they have got no chance			0
' we need to get control of our borders			0
if we have open borders then by definition we are going to be dealing with all sorts of murderers , rapists , drug dealers and other serious criminals walking in			0
’ @entity4 ’s family are said to be deeply upset by the developments			1
zalkalns was convicted of murder after luring his wife to a forest outside the @entity2 capital @entity63 where he beat her over the head with a scaffold pole and stabbed her in the chest			1
he was jailed for 12 years for the march 1997 murder but was released early in 2005			2
he fled to @entity25 in 2007 after his second wife and daughter from his first marriage , now 19 , found out about his past			1
immigration officials , who had no idea of his record , let him in			1
two years later he was arrested in @entity78 , west @entity18 , over an alleged indecent assault on a 14 - year - old girl , but was never prosecuted because the victim was unable to substantiate her account			0
@entity83 vanished while walking on the @entity85 towpath in @entity86 , west @entity18			2
zalkalns was captured on @entity89 cycling along the same path just 15 minutes after the schoolgirl walked past the camera at 3.45pm on august 28			1
she was last seen at 4.26pm			0
grainy cctv stills show @entity83 crossing a canal footbridge in @entity86 , @entity18 the footage , captured at 3:45pm on august 28 , shows @entity4 walking along the @entity85 towpath teams of police divers and sniffer dogs have spent more than a week scouring a mile of the murky canal but have found no sign of the teenager			1
detective superintendent @entity102 , who is overseeing the inquiry , said : ‘ they were both going in the same direction so it is clear he would have passed her			0
‘ the focus of this investigation is now what happened when this took place			0
’ but @entity113 is facing questions about why it has taken so long to reveal that their prime suspect is a convicted killer suspected of sexual assault			1
zalkalns disappeared on the night of september 3 from the @entity78 home he shares with his girlfriend @entity121 and their one - year - old daughter			0
yesterday police were seen digging up the garden of his flat and removing potential evidence			0
the @entity128 operates a computer system called the ‘ @entity130 ’ which contains information shared by foreign countries , including @entity26 states , on terrorists and criminals			2
anyone on the database who attempts to enter the @entity25 is supposed to be flagged by the system , allowing immigration officers the opportunity to interview them and potentially refuse entry			1
however @entity2 authorities insist they were under no obligation to forewarn their @entity25 colleagues about @entity5 ’ conviction because he was not wanted for any offence			1
@entity2 police informed @entity113 about his record a few days ago when it was requested through @entity152			2
but amid farcical scenes , detectives were still awaiting details of the case yesterday , even though it took the @entity158 less than an hour to uncover his past			2
suspect : @entity118 , a convicted murderer , cycles past 15 minutes later at 4pm @entity5 , 41 , was jailed in 1998 for battering his wife to death in his homeland , @entity2 last september a report by the @entity167 said the index was ‘ unstable and at risk of collapsing ’ and that it ‘ contained a great deal of out - of - date information ’			1
last night it was unclear whether even @entity5 ’ girlfriend was aware of his past			2
miss @entity121 , a 39 - year - old waitress from @entity174 , has described him as a loving family man who dotes on their daughter @entity176			0
police have issued an all ports and airports alert for the @entity2 and urged people not to approach him			1
they also announced a reward of up to £ 20,000 for information			0
last night a @entity186 spokesman said they would not comment further on the 1998 conviction : ‘ as with all live investigations there is information that the police have that they can not and should not make public			0
to obtain the full file in relation to the conviction of @entity118 we now need to obtain an international letter of request			0
’ a @entity128 spokesman said : ‘ we have detailed arrangements in place to identify people of concern entering the @entity25			2
‘ all passengers are checked against police , security and immigration watch lists and where we are aware of individuals who pose a risk , @entity214 officers can – and do – refuse them entry			0
