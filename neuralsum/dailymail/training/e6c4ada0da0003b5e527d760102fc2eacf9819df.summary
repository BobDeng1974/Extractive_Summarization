controversial airport ' strip - search ' full body scanners are to be scrapped after they failed to get approval from @entity5 bosses			1
experts feared the ' naked ' body scanners , which use x-ray technology to show up hidden explosives or weapons , could emit harmful levels of cancer - causing radiation			1
the move in @entity5 begs the question -- why are they still allowed in the @entity16 ? hundreds of the devices are in use at at least 68 airports across the nation			1
controversial : a demonstration of the scanners that @entity5 bosses have failed to give approval of			1
a full body scan is shown , left , and a screen showing the results of the scan , right new trials of the device , which display a ' naked ' image of the person being scanned - were blocked by the @entity32 last november			2
but @entity33 , the only airport in @entity5 using the $ 130,000 machines , was told it could continue using them for another year			1
now , after the machines have come to the end of their three year trial , @entity32 chiefs have failed to give their approval for their full time use			1
@entity32 bosses eventually declared the risk was ' close to zero ' in a report in may -- and @entity33 airport expected the technology would be approved for permanent use			1
but bosses were left waiting for the green light and now say they have been left with no option but to axe the 16 security machines because @entity53 legislation does not allow security trials to exceed a three - year period			1
as @entity33 airport introduced the scanners as part of a security pilot in october 2009 , they will have to scrap the machines at the end of next month			1
the scanners have been controversial among flyers since they were introduced in force at @entity16 airports in 2010			2
the @entity65 began installing hundreds of the devices after the foiled christmas day 2009 attempt to blow up a @entity69 - bound passenger jet with an underwear bomb			2
the @entity65 insists that research shows the devices do no emit harmful levels of radiation , but the issues is far from settled in the minds of many flyers -- some of whom opt for full - body pat - downs instead of passing through the machines			1
last month , @entity84 rep @entity82 said greater study and oversight of the machines was needed -- especially in cases when the broke down in a red - tape wrangle , $ 1.8m will be splashed out on new ' privacy - friendly ' machines at @entity91 and the recruitment of an extra 55 full - time security officers , who will manually frisk passengers			1
the new scanners will use radio - frequency technology instead of x-ray radiation			1
@entity16 use : more than 600 @entity100 units , using x-ray technology , have been installed at 140 airports across the @entity16 @entity103 , spokesman for the airport , said : ' we ’ve been talking to passengers literally every week and our security staff and overwhelmingly in august it was 100 % thumbs - up to security at @entity33			1
' we ’ve had visits from airport and governments from all over the world to see how we do it			0
' ' today , we ’re just kind of standing around scratching our heads wondering why a trial that was popular with everybody , that everybody approved of , just never got the green light from @entity5			1
' the report from the @entity122 in may said radiation doses were ' very low ' compared with other sources such as cosmic radiation received during flights			1
but it did add that the long - term effects , such as cancer risks , could not be ' entirely excluded '			1
@entity32 : @entity32 chiefs have failed to give their approval for their full time use despite a report declaring the risk was ' close to zero ' @entity16 academic dr @entity135 said he believed the scanner could deliver up to 20 times more radiation to the skin than previously thought - potentially increasing the risk of skin cancer			1
fears were also raised that the scanners were an invasion of privacy and some passengers and religious groups had questioned their use			2
the scanners were introduced at @entity33 in a security crackdown after incidents such as the attempted ' underwear bomb ' terror plot in 2009			2
the airport said around 10 passengers were unable to board their flight after refusing to pass through the scanners , known as ' back scatter ' machines			2
the passenger screening programme at airports in the @entity16 has had frequent complaints that not all passengers are screened in the same way			0
in reaction to this , the @entity65 ( @entity65 ) has replaced the machines , which give a detailed outline of individuals ' figures , for a more generic shape			2
on the updated machine , the passenger and the @entity65 worker both view the image together which lights up on screen if it detects a problem			0
the need for a separate @entity65 officer viewing the image in another room is no longer required			0
the new images are said to be ' very generic ' and ' focus on the privacy of the passenger '			0
the images of passengers are not stored or printed and can not be transmitted			0
they are deleted from the system once they have been viewed			0
those who fly are not required by law to pass through @entity100 screening - but if they opt out , they will receive alternative screening , including a physical pat - down			0
the @entity65 has continued to defend the safety of the x-ray devices , saying they expose passengers to the same radiation as two minutes on a flying plane			2
they were used at @entity199 but scrapped amid complaints about invasion of privacy			0
they have also been tested in @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207			0
research has suggested that , despite the low radiation dosage , that because of the large number of scanners in the @entity16 , hundreds of passengers a year could get cancer			1
when there were 250 scanners in the @entity16 last year , research suggested up to 100 passengers a year could get cancer			2
earlier this year it was reported that more than 600 @entity100 units , using x-ray technology , have been installed at 140 airports across the @entity16 the first x-ray body scanner was developed in 1992 by @entity224			1
he sold the technology and rights to @entity227 , which now manufactures and distributes the device			0
fears about the health risks were raised in the @entity16 as far back as 1998 when the machine known as the @entity232 was evaluated by a panel of radiation safety experts brought together by the @entity235			2
they all expressed concerns about the machine because it violated a longstanding principle that humans should not be x-rayed unless there is a medical purpose			0
the machine ’s inventor told panelists that the machine would most probably not be widely used for many years to come			0
@entity248 in @entity248 was the first airport to implement the scanners in 2007			0
in the @entity16 the @entity65 scanners sparked a heated debate over security concerns versus travelers ' privacy when they were first brought in in autumn 2010			0
the machines have also been installed in some courtrooms			0
in response , @entity258 's legislature issued a resolution urging @entity261 to review the programme			0
study group @entity263 then filed a lawsuit to suspend the use of scanners at @entity16 airports pending an independent review			0
in february 2011 , a trial of new ' non-intrusive ' body scanners started at @entity272 , @entity273 , and @entity274 before they were rolled out permanently in july last yer			0
@entity278 's @entity277 followed in september last year , where more than eight million passengers boarded planes in 2010 .			0
