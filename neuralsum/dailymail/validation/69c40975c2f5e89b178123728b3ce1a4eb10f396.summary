two moms started a science - themed clothing line for girls after they realized they could n't find clothing featuring rocket ships and dinosaurs outside the boys ' department			1
@entity8 and @entity11 's @entity10 line has dresses , leggings , t - shirts and underwear with rocket ship , train and dinosaur patterns for girls between 18 months and eight years old			1
the moms said that though they have no experience in the business of fashion , the idea for @entity22 stands for science , technology , engineering and math - came out of experiences with their own daughters			1
we just think there needs to be more than just that offered for our girls , ' @entity8 , 37 , of @entity50 , @entity34 , told @entity51			2
she said her now - five - year - old daughter wanted to be an astronaut for @entity55 in 2013 , but noticed the costume catalog only had boys wearing the costume			0
' she looked at me and said , ' i ca n't be an astronaut			0
they 're only for boys ' , ' @entity8 told @entity51			0
after seeing pictures of @entity64 , @entity65 and other female astronauts , however , her daughter still dressed up as an astronaut , according to the moms ' kickstarter page			0
@entity8 said her daughter wanted to be an astronaut for @entity55 , but was put off by the fact that only boys wore the costume in the catalogs @entity8 and @entity11 said that their daughters are interested in things that are not usually found on girls ' clothing , including space ships , dinosaurs and trains @entity8 told @entity11 , 34 , also of @entity50 , about the issue and they were both frustrated			1
@entity11 told @entity51 that her three - year - old daughter is ' very into trains ' and when she and her husband wanted to buy train - themed underwear as a gift to their daughter for @entity90 , they could only find boy 's underwear			1
' i was actually at their house on @entity90 and saw the boys ' underpants under the tree , and it was that moment that it kind of clicked , ' @entity8 said			0
' i said , ' you know what , @entity11 ? we should make underpants with trains on them … and then we thought why just underpants : there are no dinosaurs or rocket ships on leggings or dresses for girls ' , ' she added			2
the women , who have no experience in the business of fashion created dresses , leggings , t - shirts and underwear for girls between 18 months and eight years old @entity123 standing for science , technology , engineering and math - was registered as a business in april 2014			1
since the business 's origination , the moms have raised more than $ 52,500 for the company through a @entity133 and so the pair filed their business registration for @entity43 in april 2014			0
' if there is something that is not fair - because my daughter will say that it is not fair - you can actually start working toward doing something about it , ' said @entity8			0
with help from a textile designer and a @entity133 that helped them raise $ 52,500 to date , the clothing line will be available in july			2
' one of the things that i 'm happiest about … is what i think we 've shown our daughters , ' @entity11 said			2
' we 're two working moms			0
we do n't have a background in fashion , and we saw a need and we worked hard			0
' the clothing line features simply designed outfits that are easily mixed - and - matched with train , space and dinosaur themes			1
clothing can come in blue and pink or teal and gray @entity11 said she was disappointed when she wanted to give her daughter train - themed underwear as a gift for @entity90 , but could n't find any in the girls ' department			1

@entity8 and @entity11 's @entity10 line has dresses , leggings , t - shirts and underwear for girls
the clothing features rocket ship , train and dinosaur patterns
neither woman has experience in the fashion business *industry*
both moms said that the *inspiration* behind the clothing line stems from experiences they 've had with their own daughters
