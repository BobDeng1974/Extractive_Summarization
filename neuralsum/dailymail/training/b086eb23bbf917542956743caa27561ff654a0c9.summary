by @entity0 published : 06:26 est , 2 august 2013 updated : 08:09 est , 2 august 2013 this angler will be enjoying seafood suppers for weeks after landing an enormous 8ft halibut big enough to make 400 portions of fish and chips			1
it took @entity8 , 45 , and two other men almost five hours to reel in the mighty 428lb catch in the @entity11 off @entity12 , which mr @entity8 described as being ' the size of a door '			1
as he left for his latest angling trip the @entity17 banker 's wife had told him to be sure to bring home a fish supper , said mr @entity8			1
catch of the day : @entity17 fisherman @entity8 spent five hours reeling in the huge halibut , which he described as being ' the size of a door ' her husband , from @entity25 near @entity26 , went on to haul in one of the biggest halibuts on record			1
' i thought my hook had struck the ground at first because there was so much resistance , ' mr @entity8 said			2
' i tried to dislodge it and after a few seconds i realised the ground was moving			0
we had to start the engine because it started swimming away			0
' after about 20 minutes it tired and slowed down and that 's when the hard work started			0
' my rod was bent at 90 degrees and i had to work for over four hours to bring it to the surface			1
by that time my arms were burning and i was covered in sweat			0
' when it came to the surface it was about the size of a door			1
' monster : @entity54 's huge halibut was so vast it yielded 400 filleted portions after hauling the monster fish on board with ropes , all three men had to stand on one side of the boat to prevent it from lurching beneath the weight of the halibut			1
' we all had to stand on one side of the boat to keep it balanced , ' he said			0
once they reached dry land , the halibut was weighed and measured before being carved up into about 400 filleted portions and distributed			0
a halibut main course in a quality fish restaurant could cost as much as £ 25 - meaning mr @entity8 's haul could have realised a value of around £ 10,000			2
but because the fish was caught in the @entity11 off @entity12 , mr @entity8 was only allowed to take home or export a maximum of 15kg - around 30 portions			1
impressive haul : weighing a massive 428lbs , the halibut is one of the biggest ever caught by a fisherman he donated most of the rest to the man who rented him the 19ft fishing boat			0
' my wife 's three favourite fish are halibut , halibut and halibut and she wanted me to bring some back with me			2
' i think we will be eating halibut for a long time to come , ' mr @entity8 said			0
the current halibut records stands at 482lbs 13ozs , landed by another @entity17 angler , @entity101 , off @entity12 in 2009			1
@entity103 halibut are among the largest bony fish in the world			2
their native habitat is the northern @entity103 , from @entity108 to the @entity11 and as far south as the @entity109			0
they can reach up to 15ft in length and weigh up to 700lbs and can live for 50 years .			0

@entity54 , 45 , landed 428lb beast of coast of @entity12
too three men almost five hours to reel in fish the ' size of a door '
