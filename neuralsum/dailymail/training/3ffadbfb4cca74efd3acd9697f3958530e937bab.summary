by @entity0 published : 12:09 est , 18 april 2013 updated : 16:54 est , 18 april 2013 @entity2 writer @entity1 has competition for her erotic fiction throne ... and @entity5 - sitting pretty at the top of @entity8 's steamiest chart with her @entity10 novel entwined with you - had better watch out			1
another woman has been churning out racy tales of sex and sadomasochism as fast as her hot little hand will allow , and her new one hit the top of the @entity21 charts within two weeks of its release			1
and thanks to the online success of @entity27 , the first of @entity31 - born @entity30 's six - part mastered series , the e-book is now being published in print by @entity33			1
@entity30 's steamy novel , with this collar , claims to be even racier than @entity2 by @entity36 writer @entity1 with this collar tells the story of @entity39 , who finds herself unexpectedly thrown into the world of @entity41 at her best friend 's wedding			1
as she begins to object during a ceremony in which her friend vows submission to her new husband , she is stopped by @entity49 , who offers to introduce her into the clandestine lifestyle			1
speaking to @entity52 , @entity51 said : ' i had written nine books but then i went through a difficult divorce and i channelled all my creative energy in to writing murder mystery novels , but i ended up taking a break			2
' i 've always been interested in erotic fiction and then after my divorce i started dating again and met some gentlemen who were a little more risqué than my ex-husband			1
' so i actually had a little bit of experience that was helpful , and it allowed me bring an added dynamic to the romances that i write			2
' @entity51 said : ' i 've always been interested in erotic fiction and then after my divorce i started dating again and met some gentlemen who were a little more risqué than my ex-husband ' @entity68 , ceo of @entity69 , said : ' we watched the @entity2 phenomenon with interest , we 've seen the copy cats so we decided to get right under the skin of what women want when it comes to their " me time " reading material			1
' over the last 2 months we 've surveyed 1800 women in the @entity36 and @entity80 and we know that they 're hungry for well - written , sexy stories about love , power and relationships			1
' they want real - life romance that does n't stop at the bedroom door			1
but above all they want great stories , believable characters and provocative storylines			2
' with this collar is available as an e-book for 79p and in print for £ 6.99 from @entity33 publishing			1
with this collar is the first in the six - part mastered series ' would you like to offer your submission ? ' @entity97 asked			1
@entity100 tipped back her head			2
' yes , sir , i would			2
' @entity104 picked up something from the mantel and offered it to @entity97			2
@entity39 stood on her toes , trying to get a better look			2
' to the vanilla world it looks like a silver necklace with a lock on it , ' @entity49 said			2
' but those of us in the lifestyle recognise it for what it is			2
' ' @entity27 ? ' @entity39 repeated			1
the word startled her so much that she did n't think to ask what he meant by lifestyle			0
' some people use dog collars from the pet store , ' he said			0
' you ca n't be serious			0
' she wrapped her arms around her middle			0
' in this case , it appears to be an ordinary piece of jewellery , but it likely has a hex screw so that she ca n't remove it			0
' @entity97 accepted the necklace from @entity104 and passed the chain through the flame of an enormous candle			0
' he 's purifying the metal , ' @entity49 explained			1
' and then he 'll ask her again if her submission is given of her own free will			0
' @entity97 looked down at @entity100 and captured her chin before saying , ' i offer you this collar as a symbol of my love , and as a promise to be a kind , consistent and honourable master			0
in return , i will demand your servitude			0
i will enforce the rules we have agreed to , and i will never touch you in anger			0
' @entity100 linked her hands at the small of her back , while she continued to meet her new husband 's gaze			1
firmly she said , ' i accept your gift			0
in return , i offer my humble devotion and a promise of my servitude			0
' to @entity39 , the words sounded just as practised as their traditional vows had			0
' we 're here in front of our friends and mentors , and i want everyone to hear your assurance that you are willingly agreeing to be my slave			0
' the blood chilled in @entity39 's veins			1
as if @entity49 sensed it , he tightened his grip on her			0
oddly , the touch reassured and grounded her rather than annoyed her			0
' i am joyfully agreeing to be your slave , sir			0
' @entity1 with her novel @entity2 , left , and @entity30 , whose latest book with this collar topped the @entity8 erotic fiction charts just two weeks after its release			1

@entity30 's @entity27 topped @entity8 's erotic fiction charts
born in @entity31 , @entity27 is the first book in her six - part mastered series
