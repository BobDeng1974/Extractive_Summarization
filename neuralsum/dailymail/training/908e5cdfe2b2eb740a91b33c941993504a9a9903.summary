the oil painting by @entity7 artist @entity6 was purchased as an ‘ impulse buy ’ by a canny collector in 1957 who bought it at a reduced price as it was deemed unfashionable			1
art expert @entity12 was shocked when he identified the 1909 painting by @entity6 that had been missing from the art world since 1937			1
missing masterpiece : a woman from @entity17 bought this painting by @entity6 , entitled ' @entity19 ; @entity20 , ' for £ 100 in 1957			1
today it sold at auction for £ 380,000 @entity6 ’s works have become incredibly popular in recent times and so today at auction the work , which measures 20x30in , sold for £ 320,000 plus £ 60,000 of fees to an anonymous @entity29 dealer			1
the unidentified woman from @entity17 loved the painting , of a wistful - looking woman sitting on a marbled seat , until her death in 1979 when it was inherited by her daughter			1
the daughter , who did not like the painting quite as much , decided to sell it at auction			1
the family who sold the painting , entitled ‘ @entity19 ; @entity20 , ’ attended the auction at @entity44 in @entity45 , @entity17 and were ‘ very happy ’ with the price			1
mr @entity12 said : ‘ the vendor ’s mother bought it at @entity3 in @entity29 in 1957 on impulse			1
‘ now , 55 years later , her good eye has led to her family receiving this vast amount of money for it			0
‘ the family were very happy with the price			0
it is a sum of money that will make a great deal of difference to their lives			0
‘ @entity6 would have been astonished by the price			0
even his very finest works were making just £ 150 during his lifetime , which equates with barely £ 10,000 in today ’s money			0
’ tragically , @entity6 committed suicide in 1922 by putting his head in a gas oven when he feared that modern art by artists such as @entity70 were making his style of work obsolete			2
mr @entity12 said : ‘ this picture was last recorded when it sold at auction in @entity29 in 1937			0
‘ up until now scholars only knew of the picture from a 1910 print			0
@entity79 collector : the woman bought the artwork at @entity3 ( pictured ) on impulse but she died in 1979 , leaving the painting to her daughter who decided to sell it ‘ i suspect that after it sold at auction the owner could n’t sell it because nobody wanted it and gave it to @entity3 to sell for him			1
‘ the owner ’s mother was very keen on art but did n’t have a great deal of money to spend on it			0
‘ on a visit to see her sister who lived in west @entity29 in 1957 , she went in to @entity3 and was bowled over by the quality of this painting			2
‘ it is a @entity103 picture in style which was really out of fashion in the 1950s			0
‘ against the opinion of the art world she acted on impulse and paid a not inconsiderable amount of money for it			2
‘ £ 100 in 1957 was worth about £ 2,000 today but even in the late 1970s this picture would have been worth barely £ 5,000			0
’ the owner used to hang the painting on her wall but took it down for safekeeping after realising @entity6 ’s works were becoming valuable			2
the painting was either painted in @entity119 or @entity120 where @entity6 spent a lot of his time as an artist			2
it shows a buxom woman wearing a flimsy purple dress sitting with her legs up on a marble seat .			0
