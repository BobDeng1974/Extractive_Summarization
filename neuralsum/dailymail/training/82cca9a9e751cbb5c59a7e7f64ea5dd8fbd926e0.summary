by @entity0 published : 17:42 est , 18 september 2012 updated : 17:42 est , 18 september 2012 a gipsy thrown off a campsite after her son threatened other travellers with a gun suffered a breach of her human rights , @entity2 judges ruled yesterday			1
@entity12 and her family were evicted after being accused of causing a ‘ very substantial nuisance ’ and presenting ‘ a risk of disturbance and violence ’			2
despite a series of appeals being rejected by @entity23 ’s highest courts , judges in @entity19 yesterday ruled the eviction was an ‘ extreme ’ interference with the 53 - year - old ’s human rights			1
' nuisance ' : @entity12 , 53 , and her family were evicted from @entity30 caravan park in @entity31 , @entity32 , a local authority site operated by the @entity35 council they also ruled she should receive £ 3,400 to compensate her for ‘ feelings of frustration and injustice ’			1
the judgment by the @entity41 could now pave the way for other traveller families to use human rights grounds to fight eviction orders			2
the @entity12 family first moved to the @entity30 caravan park in @entity31 , @entity32 , in 1999			0
six years later the @entity48 – the traveller - run organisation which operated the local authority - owned site – obtained a possession order claiming mrs @entity12 and five others were causing trouble			1
the family were , the @entity48 said , ‘ guilty of causing very substantial nuisance ’			0
in november 2007 , three @entity57 judges headed by @entity58 upheld a possession order against @entity60 , saying that she had a ‘ generally disruptive family ’ with a ‘ culture of disrespect ’ who ‘ presented a risk of disturbance and violence ’			0
the @entity2 judges admitted that , during another appeal , a @entity83 county court judge ‘ was satisfied that her son , who resided part of the time with her , had been involved in an incident in which he threatened someone with a gun , although it was not clear whether the gun had been real or an imitation ; and had dumped garden refuse ’			0
ruling : the judgment by the @entity41 could pave the way for other traveller families to use human rights grounds to fight eviction orders however they claimed that the only wrong committed by @entity60 herself was the failure to pay a £ 95 water bill			2
they ruled that @entity23 judges had been wrong to claim the eviction order was beyond challenge , ruling it should have been considered in the light of @entity98 of the @entity99 , which guarantees respect for a person ’s home , private and family life			1
they said : ‘ the loss of one ’s home is the most extreme form of interference with the right to respect for the home			0
any person at risk of an interference of this magnitude should in principle be able to have the proportionality of the measure determined by an independent tribunal			0
’ in total mrs @entity12 - who left the site in may 2008 to live on land owned by her brother , which had no planning permission for residential use – was awarded nearly £ 7,000 in damages and legal costs			0
in past cases @entity23 courts have ruled against traveller families who have protested that evictions break their human rights , especially when there has been evidence of their disruptive behaviour			1
mrs @entity12 ’s case is thought to have cost taxpayers around £ 80,000 in legal aid and local authority fees on its way through the @entity23 court			1
legal aid is not paid by the taxpayer to support cases in @entity19 .			0
