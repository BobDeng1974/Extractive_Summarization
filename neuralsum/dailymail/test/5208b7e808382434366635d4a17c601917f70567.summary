@entity0 today finally admitted the name of the slave ancestor he had censored from his past			1
the @entity5 - winning actor posted on social media that a ' @entity7 ' of @entity8 , an ancestor on his mother 's side , was the relative dropped from the @entity12 show about his family history			1
the admission came the day after he apologized for lobbying for the removal of the truth about his family past from finding your roots			1
writing on his personal account he said : ' lots of people have been asking who the guy was			0
his name was @entity7 - lived in @entity8 on my @entity29 's side about six generations back			1
after appearing on finding your roots and learning one of his ancestors was a slave owner , @entity0 pushed the network to leave that information out of the program it was first revealed by @entity55 , a request the producers ultimately agreed to			1
however , the admission suggests @entity0 may have more than one slave - owning ancestor			1
another was named today by @entity62 as @entity63 , who kept eight slaves on his farm in what is now @entity68 in @entity69 in the 1840s			0
the affair has severely embarrassed the actor , a high - profile campaigner for liberal causes , who runs a charity for @entity76			2
it has also plunged @entity12 into crisis , and according to a prominent commentator , ' diminished ' prof @entity80 , the host of the show , who is a @entity83 academic			1
last night the actor apologized for asking producers to leave out the name in a post on @entity37 , while also explaining his reasons for his decision			1
' after an exhaustive search of my ancestry for finding your roots , it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves , ' wrote @entity0			1
' i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves			1
the very thought left a bad taste in my mouth			0
' @entity0 went on to say he lobbied for that information to be withheld after filming the episode			2
' it 's important to remember that this is n't a news program			2
finding your roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family , making you quite vulnerable , ' he explained			1
' the assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family			2
' he then added ; ' i regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story			0
we deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are , as a nation , still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery			0
it is an examination well worth continuing			0
' spotlight : the future of prof @entity80 as the host of the show is in the balance after @entity12 launched an investigation into whether its editorial code was breached			1
@entity144 genealogist @entity143 is said to have helped trace @entity0 's family tree back to @entity146 , a relative of his father @entity147			1
ms @entity143 told the @entity62 : ' there are lots of farmers in the family			0
@entity152 did n't end in @entity69 until 1846			0
' @entity0 is just one of the many celebrities once again under fire after @entity155 sorted all the hacked @entity157 emails into a system that makes them easier for the public to search			2
@entity12 meanwhile is conducting an internal investigation to determine if this omission violated the network 's editorial standards			1
they have yet to release a statement on their findings or to make clear when they will be reported , and whether they will quiz @entity0			2
however , the affair has also called into question the future of the show 's host , prof @entity80 after an exhaustive search of my ancestry for ' finding your roots , ' it was discovered that one of my distant relatives was an owner of slaves			1
i did n't want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves			1
the very thought left a bad taste in my mouth			0
@entity190 decided what went into the show			0
i lobbied him the same way i lobby directors about what takes of mine i think they should use			0
this is the collaborative creative process			0
@entity190 agreed with me on the slave owner but made other choices i disagreed with			2
in the end , it 's his show and i knew that going in			2
i 'm proud to be his friend and proud to have participated			0
it 's important to remember that this is n't a news program			2
finding your roots is a show where you voluntarily provide a great deal of information about your family , making you quite vulnerable			1
the assumption is that they will never be dishonest but they will respect your willingness to participate and not look to include things you think would embarrass your family			2
i regret my initial thoughts that the issue of slavery not be included in the story			0
we deserve neither credit nor blame for our ancestors and the degree of interest in this story suggests that we are , as a nation , still grappling with the terrible legacy of slavery			0
it is an examination well worth continuing			0
i am glad that my story , however indirectly , will contribute to that discussion			0
while i do n't like that the guy is an ancestor , i am happy that aspect of our country 's history is being talked about			1
@entity0 until now he had been a @entity83 academic best known for the ' beer summit ' organized by president @entity238 when a policeman tried to arrest him because of a 911 call about men breaking and entering a home - which was in fact prof @entity80 ' own home			2
the arrest became the center of a debate on racial profiling , and the @entity250 academic and the policeman were invited to the @entity252 to discuss the arrest and its fallout over a beer			0
however today he was described as ' diminished ' in the @entity256 by @entity257 , its columnist , as ' diminished ' by the affair which ' exposed @entity80 , a trusted authority on the @entity250 - @entity250 experience , to accusations that he 'd sold out '			0
@entity12 declined today to offer any guarantees that he would remain host of the show			1
on friday it issued a statement on his behalf but today said it was not responsible for his public statements			0
the publicly - funded broadcaster was severely criticized by its ombudsman for its handling of @entity0 and @entity273 's revelations			1
@entity274 , the ombudsman , said the channel ' took a beating '			0
' on the broader points , it seems to me that any serious program about genealogy , especially dealing with celebrities , can not leave out a slave - owning ancestor , ' he said			1
' ... gates , aside from the decision he made – and it looks to me like a bad one – also , in my opinion , violated the well - known " no surprises doctrine " for public affairs programming and many other things by not informing @entity12 about these demands by @entity0 '			1
he added : ' as for @entity12 , they just struck me as asleep at the switch when this broke			0
it was pretty apparent from the leaked emails what had happened and to put out a statement that said essentially nothing and very quickly looked pathetic , as if they were hiding something			0
' @entity12 said it had no comment to make on the ombudsman 's words .			2

@entity0 has revealed name of the slave - owning ancestor which he got @entity12 to cut from finding my roots
he says his @entity40 mother @entity41 was descended from @entity7 , a @entity8 slave - owner ' about six generations ' *ago*
