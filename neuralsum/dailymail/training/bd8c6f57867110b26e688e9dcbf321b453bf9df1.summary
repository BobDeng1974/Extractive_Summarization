@entity1 internet star @entity0 has a taste for misadventure			1
in the past 12 months the 16 - month - old has found herself stuck up trees , stranded on garage roofs , wedged under fences and even jammed in a watering can			1
with her nine lives rapidly running out , her anxious owner 's fear the worst after their treasured pet disappeared from home last month			1
she has now gone missing from her home in @entity18 after she did n't come in one evening , @entity20 and her mother @entity19 went calling all over their garden looking for @entity0			1
with no luck , they put her food out and hoped she would soon reappear			0
but in the morning tortoiseshell @entity0 had still not come home and she has been missing ever since			1
miss @entity20 , 24 , from @entity18 , said : ' i am really upset			1
she is a really homely cat and has never ventured more than four houses away			2
' she climbs up trees then is scared to get down so she just starts meowing - i 'm really worried as to what she might have got up to this time ! ' @entity0 , also known as may may , was a birthday present in december 2013 but the adventurous animal has been on a a campaign on mischief ever since			1
in just 12 months she has been stuck up trees , trapped on top of a shed roof and wedged under fences as well , as the near permanent jam in the watering can			1
in just 12 months the tortoise shell pet has also been stuck up trees , trapped on a shed roof , wedged under a fence miss @entity20 spends hours every week trying to rescue her from treetop branches where she has climbed to but is unable to get down now , miss @entity20 's other cat @entity51 is pining to have her back and @entity52 and her 46 - year - old mother are campaigning to get @entity0 home and hoping a public appeal will see her returned			1

worried : dedicated owner @entity20 fears spends hours each week rescuing her pet from mishaps and now fears for the animal 's safety the kitten disappeared and @entity52 could n't find he anywhere until @entity0 's head then popped out of the watering can			1
miss @entity20 said : ' she was just wondering what was going on			1
she kept meowing for me to get her out			0
' no amount of manoeuvring could help @entity0 wriggle out and @entity52 and her mother were forced to call in the fire brigade			2
@entity19 said : ' we let her out in the garden and then could not find her			0
' i could hear her meowing and thought ' where are you ? ' - and then her little head popped out of the watering can			2
' we tried to see if she would come out on her own and we tried to pull her out but her shoulders were stuck			2
' december 2013 : arrived at @entity52 's house december - april 2014 : constantly stealing food and climbing in cupboards april 2 , 2014 : on @entity0 's first day outside she got stuck in a watering can and the fire brigade were needed to rescue her june 2014 : first tree climb the pet was stranded all day until miss @entity20 could find her and get her down after her first tree climbing disaster			1

december 19 , 2014 : @entity0 does n't come in one evening , missing ever since			2
' it was quite a spectacle			0
there must have been eight or nine firefighters gathered around			0
' we were all having a laugh about it			0
' we said ' do n't mind the watering can - just get the cat out '			2
' she was n't distressed , she thought it was a game ! ' the firefighters safely rescued @entity0 by using a pair of tin snips , hand - held cutters , and chopped down the side of the watering can and the cat used up one of her nine lives and escaped unhurt			1
@entity120 , red watch manager at @entity123 fire station , said at the time : ' we used a pair of tin snips and cut down the side of the watering can			0
tin snips are hand - held cutters			0
' ' it was a little bit strange , but we do get strange and out of the ordinary jobs sometimes , especially involving young children and animals			0
' miss @entity20 said : ' she 's so timid and loving			2
' she is a baby			0
the first time she went outside the wind really scared her			0
' it is strange not having her around and would mean everything to have her back			0
' i 'm fetching her from trees and off the shed roof almost everyday - she might as well be the most mischievous cat in the country			0
' she 'll explore and go on adventures wherever she can but then she gets stuck or trapped and ca n't get out or down			0
' i 've had to climb onto the roof to get her more times than i can count			0
' this time i 've just got to hope she can escape on her own			0
