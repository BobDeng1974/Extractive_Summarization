by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 16:32 est , 19 february 2013 updated : 16:57 est , 19 february 2013 eighties pop star @entity3 has likened dr @entity4 to notorious @entity5 after news of country singer @entity8 's apparent suicide			1
' i think ‘ dr ’ @entity4 should change his name to @entity11			0
same results , ' he wrote on @entity13 monday night before deleting it several hours later			0
he later backtracked but but then many began criticizing the doctor 's work on @entity17 , the reality television show that @entity8 starred in seasons ago			1
it is , however , my opinion that what dr. @entity32 does is exploitation and his tv track record is not good , ' @entity3 said , referring to the four other show contestants who have died as a result of their drug and addiction battles			1
critic : eighties pop singer @entity3 likened dr @entity4 to the infamous dr @entity11 @entity42 's @entity17 with dr. @entity4 is not currently on the air			1
@entity4 switched his focus to non-celebrities in season 6 last fall and changed the title to ' rehab			2
' the show spawned two spinoffs , ' @entity51 ' and ' @entity48			2
' @entity8 was a sympathetic character on the show and appeared to be far less damaged than her fellow cast members , some of whom experienced fairly graphic symptoms of opiate withdrawal in front of the cameras			1
@entity8 suffered a seizure while on the show , further endearing her to @entity4 and the others			1
she said in a 2010 interview with the @entity1 that she initially turned @entity4 down			0
' but dr. @entity4 said something to me that just mowed me over literally , just floored me , ' she said			0
' he said , ` you 've been being treated for the symptoms of what 's wrong with you , not the problem			0
and you 're going to have to put your family aside for a moment , put their feelings aside for a moment and worry about you because if you do n't get better , it does n't matter what your family thinks			0
you 're not going to be there anymore			0
'' @entity4 diagnosed her with ' love addiction ' during the series ' run and called her an ' angel ' in the finale			2
in an interview with the @entity1 several months later , he said @entity8 had a good shot at recovery if she remained in treatment			1
airing grievances : eighties pop star @entity3 took to @entity13 to slam the famed television doctor ' like with anybody i treat , it 's really up to them , ' @entity4 said			0
if they do the work they 're supposed to do , yes ( there can be success )			0
if she does the work it will be great			0
it 's up to her how much of that she does , how much she feels she needs to do			0
it seems like she 's doing rather well right now so i hope she continues to do so			0
