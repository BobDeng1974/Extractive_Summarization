living along the west coast of @entity1 is good for your health - if you 're a killer whale			0
an orca called @entity5 , who is matriarch of a group called the @entity8 in the @entity9 , is thought to have reached the ripe old age of 103 - meaning she could have been a year old when the @entity13 sank			1
although her age is an estimate , studies into her reproductive history have plotted her birth all the way back to 1911			2
experts have been studying whales in the @entity9 , called the @entity8 ( @entity23 ) since the early 1970s			1
@entity5 , pictured , is said to be the matriarch of the group and was spotted in the @entity26 at the weekend researchers began studying the resident orcas in the early 1970s			1
at that time they had photos of @entity31 , known as @entity32 , and @entity5 , taken in 1971			2
their relative size suggests they were both fully grown adults when the photo was taken , meaning they were both at least 20 years old in 1971			0
experts at the time said @entity39 was the younger of the two , and due to their association , suggested @entity5 was @entity31 ’ mother			1
if @entity39 was at least 20 in 1971 , she would have been born in 1951 , and since @entity5 was not spotted with any more children after this date , the researchers assumed @entity39 was her final calf			1
female killer whales stop producing at around the age of 40 , which means if @entity39 was born in 1951 , and @entity5 was 40 at that time , her birth year would be 1911			1
@entity5 was spotted in the @entity26 on saturday and is thought to have travelled up from @entity51 with her pod , dubbed @entity53			1
it is the first time @entity5 , officially known as @entity5 , had returned to the northwest since the 3 march , according to captain @entity56 of @entity57			2
he captured the images using a telephoto lens			0
@entity56 said he recognised @entity5 because she has a white patch on the dorsal fin alongside a half - moon - shaped notch			2
news of the @entity5 ’s return was announced by the @entity67 ( @entity67 )			1
executive director @entity68 said @entity69 had travelled up from the coast of @entity51 , near the mouth of the @entity72 , where it was spotted eight days before @entity56 ’s sighting			1
this means the pod covered around 800 miles in just over a week			1
@entity56 said : ‘ we were thrilled to see her			0
and it ’s mind - blowing to think that this whale is over 100 years old			2
she was born before the @entity13 went down			0
can you imagine the things she ’s seen in her lifetime ? ’ @entity5 , pictured , is thought to be 103 years old			1

experts have been studying whales in the @entity9 since the 1970s
this particular pod is called the @entity8 ( @entity23 )
*granny* is said to be the matriarch of the group and was spotted in the @entity26 at the weekend
she is thought to have travelled around 800 miles up from @entity51
the average lifespan of a wild orca is between 60 and 80 years
@entity5 ’s age is an *educated* guess based on her reproduction history
