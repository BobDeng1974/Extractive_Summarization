by @entity1 reporter published : 13:29 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 17:04 est , 29 september 2013 the rate of @entity3 picking up and moving each year is near a record low despite indications last year that the recession - era trend might be improving			1
@entity8 data showed an improvement last year in people moving from one house to another			2
the important indicator of economic strength saw record highs during the boom years and the improvement was cause for optimism in the country ’s besieged housing sector			0
but the bump now appears to have been short - lived as 2013 data sinks back to near 2011 ’s lows			2
downward trend : @entity3 move far less than they did in the years leading up to and during the housing bubble and the trend is improving only sluggishly according to data assembled by @entity29 , post-housing bubble lows came in 2011 when 11.6 percent of @entity3 picked up and moved			1
back during the 1950s and 1960s — as families moved en masse to booming cities in @entity35 and elsewhere in the @entity36 — the rate hovered around 20 percent each year			1
leading up to and during the housing bubble of the early 2000s , that number had surged back to around 17 percent each year			1
but in 2013 , that number was a meager 11.7 percent			1
higher than 2011 stats , though not by much			0
golden years : in the 1950s and 1960s , some 20 percent of @entity3 moved each year , but those rates no longer break 12 percent improvement ? moving for all reasons is down from pre-housing bubble numbers , while moving for a job is slightly up from the 2010 - 2011 data data from 2012 indicated a rise with 12 percent of people moving , making 2013 ’s poor showing all the more depressing for @entity3 hopeful for an accelerating economic recovery			1
@entity52 , the data has not been all bad in 2013			0
while short - distance , intra-county moves are at an all - time low of 7.5 percent this year , longer distance moves are slightly up from 2011 and 2010			1
however , the explanation for this could be disheartening			0
while short - distance moves are for people looking for new or better homes — a leading force behind the @entity3 economy — longer - distance moves across counties and states tend to be more for those in search of work			2
while this suggests that the job market is picking up ahead of the housing market , both indicate a sluggish recovery			0
the rates of longer - distance moves , while improved from 2010 - 2011 , are still far lower than pre-housing bubble levels			0
recovery ? a 2011 map shows state - to - state moves , a trend that indicates moves for better jobs			0
moves for better housing are at all - time lows , which indicates a continued sluggish housing recovery			0

in the 1950s and 1960s , 20 percent of @entity3 moved each year *--* in 2013 , only 11.7 percent moved
