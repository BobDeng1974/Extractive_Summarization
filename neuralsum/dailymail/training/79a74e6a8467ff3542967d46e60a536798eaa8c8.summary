lethal @entity2 drones are launched from a top secret base in @entity4 , it has emerged			1
the @entity5 uses the base to target @entity8 operatives in neighbouring @entity9 , according to the @entity10			1
it was from this base that the @entity2 - born operative @entity13 was killed in 2011			1
it has also emerged that up to 54 countries may have helped the @entity5 to hold terrorism suspects in secret prisons , or turn them over to foreign governments , a human rights organisation has claimed			1
the drone that killed @entity2 - born operative @entity13 in 2011 was launched from a secret base in @entity4 , it has emerged the revelation comes amid a growing outcry against the @entity25 administration 's use of deadly drones and their use to watch @entity2 citizens			1
it is the first time the location of the secret drone base has been revealed			0
it 's whereabouts had remained secret at the request of high - ranking officials , although it was known that one had been built			0
@entity37 is now trying to limit the power the @entity2 has to kill suspected terrorists , including @entity2 citizens , with drones			1
the drone programme is expected to be the major talking point when the @entity44 interviews @entity45 , the @entity47 's choice for @entity5 chief on thursday			2
yesterday the government defended its lethal drone programme by citing the laws that were introduced following the september 11 attacks			0
many in @entity37 now believe the scope of the laws may be too broad			0
@entity57 senator @entity56 said in a recent : ' it has to be in the agenda of this @entity37 to reconsider the scope of action of drones and use of deadly force by the @entity2 around the world because the original authorisation of use of force , i think , is being strained to its limits , ' congressman @entity72 , the number two @entity73 in the @entity75 , said yesterday , that ' it deserves a serious look at how we make the decisions in government to take out , kill , eliminate , whatever word you want to use , not just @entity2 citizens but other citizens as well			2
' @entity72 added : ' we ought to carefully review our policies as a country			0
' @entity57 chairman @entity90 and the panel 's top @entity91 , senator @entity93 , both have both quietly expressed concerns about the deadly operation and the @entity97 is likely to hold hearings on @entity2 drone policy , an aide said on tuesday			2
the @entity2 government can legally order the killing of @entity2 citizens if they have senior - level ties to @entity8 the memo outlines for the first time the @entity25 administration 's decision to kill @entity8 terror suspects without any evidence that specific and imminent plots are being planned against the @entity2			1
earlier this week , a group of 11 @entity57 and @entity91 senators urged president @entity25 to release a classified @entity114 legal opinion justifying when @entity2 counter-terror missions , including drone strikes , can be used to kill @entity2 citizens abroad			2
without those documents , it 's impossible for @entity37 and the public to decide ' whether this authority has been properly defined , and whether the president 's power to deliberately kill @entity2 is subject to appropriate limitations and safeguards , ' the senators wrote			0
' the threat posed by @entity8 and its associated forces demands a broader concept of imminence in judging when a person continually planning terror attacks presents an imminent threat , ' concluded the document			0
@entity2 citizen @entity13 , who was born in @entity135 , was killed by a drone in @entity9 in 2011			1
it was launched from a secret base in @entity4 the memo was immediately decried by civil liberties groups as ' flawed ' and ' profoundly disturbing ' - especially in light of 2011 @entity2 drone strikes in @entity9 that killed three @entity2 citizens : @entity13 , his 16 - year - old - son and @entity145			1
@entity146 was linked to the planning and execution of several attacks targeting @entity2 and @entity151 interests , including the attempt to down a @entity154 - bound airliner in 2009 and the plot to bomb cargo planes in 2010			2
his son was killed in a separate strike on a suspected @entity8 den. @entity145 was an @entity8 propagandist			0
@entity161 spokesman @entity160 called the strikes ' legal , ethical and wise ' and said they are covered by a law that @entity37 approved allowing the use of military force against @entity8			0
he added : ' it is a matter of fact that @entity8 is in a state of war against us and that senior leaders , operational leaders of @entity8 are continually plotting to attack the @entity2 , plotting to kill @entity2 citizens as they did most horrifically on september 11th of 2001			0
' three days after september 11 , @entity37 approved a law authorising the military to use ' all necessary and appropriate force ' against @entity8 and other groups believed to be helping or harbouring the global terror network , including the use of drone strikes			0
because militants have since splintered into a number of affiliates and sympathisers the current laws could allow military force against thousands of people across the @entity186 and @entity187 who have limited or no ability to strike the @entity2			0
both the @entity5 and the @entity2 military are authorised to remotely pilot unmanned , missile - carrying drones against terror suspects			1
it 's unknown exactly how many strikes have been carried out , but experts say that drone attacks in @entity196 are conducted by the @entity5 , while those in @entity9 and @entity198 , for example , are by military forces			1
the drones have strained diplomacy between the @entity2 and the nations where the strikes are carried out , as civilians have been killed alongside the targeted terrorists , even though most nations have given @entity206 at least tacit agreement to carry out the attacks			1
the use of drones has caused tensions in some countries where civilians have died a @entity186 diplomat said that in @entity9 , for example , an increase of @entity2 drone strikes last month have killed dozens of people and upset the local public , leading some leaders in @entity221 to reconsider how often they should be used			1
the @entity222 is also considering basing surveillance drones in @entity224 to monitor on burgeoning extremist violence in @entity187 , but it 's not clear if they will be armed , it has emerged			1
the campaign against the use of drones to spy on @entity2 citizens has also been growing in momentum			2
on monday , @entity232 , in @entity231 , became the first city in the @entity2 to pass a resolution against the use of drones for surveillance against @entity2 citizens			1
it calls on @entity37 and the @entity239 of the @entity231 to bring in laws ' prohibiting information obtained from the domestic use of drones from being introduced into a @entity245 or state court			2
' the resolution also ' pledges to abstain from similar uses with city - owned , leased or borrowed drones			0
' @entity250 , a council member who voted in favour of the bill , told @entity253 that drones are ' pretty clearly a threat to our constitutional right to privacy			0
' she added : ' if we do n't get out ahead of it to establish some guidelines for how drones are used , they will be used in a very invasive way and we 'll be left to try and pick up the pieces			0
' the campaign has been helped by a @entity114 memo that has recently surfaced , which show drones can strike against a wider range of threats than previously believed .			0
