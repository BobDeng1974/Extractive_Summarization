by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter @entity3 is to boost the dosages of its lethal injection drugs even as it stands by the january execution of an inmate who made unusual snorting and gasping sounds that led to a civil rights lawsuit			1
the state 's new policy , announced on monday , considerably increases the amount of the sedative used in its two - drug combination and raises the amount of the painkiller , which are injected simultaneously , according to a court filing			1
the state said it was making the changes ' to allay any remaining concerns ' after the last execution			2
the @entity24 said its review of the jan. 16 execution of @entity27 determined he was asleep and unconscious a few minutes after the drugs were administered and his execution was conducted in a constitutional manner			1
humane : @entity3 officials say that the drug used in the execution of @entity27 was humane , despite taking 26 minutes killer : @entity37 ( pictured ) was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of @entity41 in 1989 ' he did not experience pain , distress or air hunger after the drugs were administered or when the bodily movements and sounds occurred , ' the state said			1
the department said it ' finds no harm in increasing the dosage levels of its drugs , ' after consulting with its medical expert and examining other states ' practices , spokeswoman @entity50 said			0
the state 's policy change comes 30 days before the next scheduled execution on may 28 , when a man convicted of killing a @entity64 produce vendor in 1983 is set to die			1
@entity37 's fitful 26 - minute execution was the longest since @entity3 resumed putting inmates to death in 1999			1
his adult children complained it amounted to torture , with his son saying : ' nobody deserves to go through that			0
' lawsuit : @entity37 's son , @entity76 , has filed a lawsuit against the state for the unusually slow death of his father during his execution the @entity37 family 's attorney criticized the state 's report , saying it relied on a medical expert who predicted before the execution that @entity37 would n't experience air hunger , desperate attempts to catch one 's breath while suffocating			1
' that causes some concern as to whether they looked at it from both sides , ' defense attorney @entity93 said			0
the state 's execution policy calls for it to use a specialty dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital , made by non-federally regulated pharmacies , as its first choice			2
if that ca n't be obtained , as has happened twice , it goes to a backup method of midazolam , a sedative , and hydromorphone , a painkiller			0
the state said its review found high doses of hydromorphone commonly cause people to stop breathing , as does midazolam			2
with the drugs given together , it said , the effect ' is much greater			0
' snorting : during @entity37 's execution , witnesses heard him snorting and gasping for air , which is why his son is suing the state in about two weeks , the state must say whether it has found pentobarbital for the may 28 execution of @entity131 or must go to the backup method			1
in a rare move , @entity131 's attorneys and prosecutors are asking for him be spared , though for different reasons			0
states are in a bind for two main reasons : @entity141 companies have cut off supplies of certain execution drugs because of opposition to capital punishment in @entity141			0
and states ca n't simply switch to other chemicals without triggering legal challenges			0
@entity149 has struggled to obtain execution drugs and has had to change its three - drug protocol to a dose of pentobarbital .			2

there were *questions* about the january 16 execution of @entity27 , who was convicted of the 1989 rape and murder of @entity41
it took @entity37 about *25* minutes to die after he *'d* been injected with the lethal dose of chemicals
despite the amount of time it took @entity37 to die , the state has ruled that the execution was not *unconstitutional*
