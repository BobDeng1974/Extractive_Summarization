@entity1 has an ' addiction ' to sugar which is making us eat the wrong kind of apples , chef @entity0 has said			1
the @entity8 tv cook said our love for sugar has caused a growth in popularity of sweeter - tasting @entity13 , @entity14 and gala apples			1
this has led to a decline in sales for traditional fruit like the @entity21 apple , despite the country having perfect conditions for its growth			1
mr @entity0 said : ' the @entity14 and the @entity13 are not great apples			1
they have been engineered on sweetness , shapes , colours and resistance to disease			0
but mostly sugar , sugar , sugar			2
that ’s not the definition of a good food			0
we are addicted to sugar and the retailers know it			0
' our taste is now so neutralised that we identify taste with sweetness			0
@entity58 is not a good taste			0
for any great taste , you need contradictions , a mix of sweet , sour , acid , bitter or salty			2
' you have lost the taste of the apple			0
' the @entity13 ( left ) and @entity67 ( right ) apples taste sweeter than some varieties , but this is because they have lower acidity , rather than having higher sugar content @entity0 says the @entity21 apple ( pictured ) , which is seeing a decline in sales , has a ' beautiful balance of acidity , sweetness and perfume ' in the last year , the sweeter - tasting gala apples - @entity1 's most popular - accounted for 31 per cent of sales , with 32,237 tonnes sold			1
meanwhile @entity21 , which is less sweet but has a less ' artificial ' flavour , accounted for 21 per cent , or 21,310 tonnes			1
the sugar content of most apples is between 12 and 14 per cent , with a few the highest supermarket - sold apples reaching 20 per cent			2
@entity1 eat 80 per cent more red apples than green ones			2
it is believed that the red appearance is associated with a sweeter taste			2
but according to apple experts , it is not necessarily the level of sugar in an apple which makes it sweet			1
the @entity21 apple has a similar level of sugar to @entity67 and @entity13 apples , but has a lower acid content			1
@entity102 , the chief executive of @entity103 and @entity104 , which promotes the @entity106 apple industry , said : ' the @entity21 balances sweetness and acidity , but the @entity67 is all sweetness			1
' people associate appearance with taste , but that ’s often not the case			0
' mr @entity0 , who runs the two @entity118 star @entity116 restaurant and hotel in @entity120 , @entity121 , is trying to grow 115 varieties of apple in his large orchard , including two types of @entity21 apple			1
he said : ' they have this beautiful balance of acidity , sweetness and perfume			0
and they [ appear to ] have less sugar			0
but that ’s the problem : we are so addicted to sugar that we are not used to these flavours			0

chef @entity0 says *brits* eat the wrong apples because of a sugar ' addiction '
he says we *choose* @entity67 and @entity14 apples over @entity21 because they are sweeter
the @entity8 chef is frustrated at @entity140 not eating more *homegrown* apples
but experts say acidity levels , rather than sugar , make apples taste sweet
