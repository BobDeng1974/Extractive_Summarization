by @entity0 it is a shocking demonstration of the effect global warming will have on @entity4			2
a new interactive map reveals that based on current predictions , @entity6 will feel like @entity8 does today , while @entity9 will have @entity11 - like temperatures			2
the organisation behind the map warms that all of @entity4 will be ' like @entity14 '			1
enter your city below to see the prediction the analysis only accounts for daytime summer heat - the hottest temperatures of the day , on average between june - august			0
it does n’t incorporate humidity or dewpoint , both of which contribute to how uncomfortable summer heat can feel			0
this projected warming also assumes greenhouse gas emissions keep increasing through 2080 , just as they have been for the past several decades			0
on average , temperatures will be 7 - 10 ° f warmer with some cities as much as 12 ° f hotter by the end of the century			1
' summer temperatures in most @entity4 cities are going to feel like summers now in @entity36 - very , very hot , ' said @entity37 of @entity38 , lead researcher of the analysis , which looked at projected changes in average summer ( june - july - august ) high temperatures			1
on average , those temperatures will be 7 - 10 ° f warmer with some cities as much as 12 ° f hotter by the end of the century			1
' in some cases , summers will warm so dramatically that their best comparison is to cities in the @entity50 , it said			0
' take @entity6 , for example			0
' summer highs there are projected to average a scorching 111 ° f , which is what summer temperatures are like today in @entity57 , @entity8			0
and at 114 ° f ° , living in @entity9 will feel like summering in sweltering @entity58			0
the graphic reveals @entity60 will feel like @entity14 , with temperatures topping @entity62 @entity6 will be among the worst hit places , with temperatures akin to those found in @entity8 the research also highlighted @entity67 , where average summer high temperatures will likely be more than 10 ° f hotter than they are now , making it feel as steamy as @entity69 is today			1
@entity70 , @entity71 , where summer high temperatures are expected to warm an averageof 12 ° f , which puts it on par with broiling @entity76 , @entity77			1
' for our @entity80 interactive we have projected summer high temperatures for the end of this century for 1,001 cities , and then showed which city in the @entity4 — or elsewhere in the world , if we could n’t find one here — is experiencing those temperatures today			2

most cities in @entity4 will be ' like @entity14 or @entity77 '
temperatures will be 7 - 10 ° f warmer
some cities will see rises of as much as 12 ° f
