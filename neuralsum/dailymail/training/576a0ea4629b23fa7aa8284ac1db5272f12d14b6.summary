by @entity1 reporter published : 20:39 est , 18 november 2012 updated : 11:46 est , 19 november 2012 famously freewheeling @entity2 may no longer be a city where anything goes - and that includes clothing			0
the city 's lawmakers are scheduled to vote on tuesday on laws that would ban nudity in most public places - and , in a funny twist , it 's a man called @entity14 who 's leading the campaign			1
supervisor for the gay @entity17 @entity14 's proposals to ban anyone over the age of five from exposing ' his or her genitals , perineum or anal region on any public street , sidewalk , street median , parklet or plaza ' have caused outrage amongst the city 's many nudie devotees			1
sheriffs plan to escort at the hearing who tries to strip in protest from the building @entity14 felt compelled to act two years ago after constituents complained about the naked men who gather in a small @entity17 plaza most days and sometimes walk the streets au naturel			1
he persuaded his colleagues last year to pass a law requiring a cloth to be placed between public seating and bare rears , yet the complaints have continued			2
' i do n't think having some guys taking their clothes off and hanging out seven days a week at @entity17 and @entity65 is really what @entity2 is about			2
i think it 's a caricature of what @entity2 is about , ' @entity14 said			0
the proposed ban predictably has produced outrage , as well as a lawsuit			2
outrage : many @entity2 residents are angry at @entity17 supervisor @entity14 for sponsoring the proposed public nudity ban last week , about two dozen people disrobed in front of @entity43 and marched around the block			1
@entity77 , 37 , said he understands the disgust of residents who would prefer not to see the body modifications and sex enhancement devices sported by some of the @entity17 nudists			0
but he thinks @entity14 's prohibition goes too far in undermining a tradition ' that keeps @entity2 weird			0
' ' a few lewd exhibitionists are really ruining it for the rest of us , ' he said			0
' it 's my time to come out now to present myself in a light and show what true nudity is all about so people can separate the difference between what a nudist is and an exhibitionist is			0
' because clothes are required to enter @entity43 itself , demonstrators who try to disrobe at the board of supervisors meeting will be escorted out by sheriff 's deputies			0
@entity2 lawyer @entity107 filed a federal lawsuit last week on behalf three men that seeks to block @entity14 's ordinance , if it passes and is signed by mayor @entity112			1
outspoken believer : @entity77 , 37 , is an avid nudist supporter in @entity2 the complaint alleges that the ban infringes on the free speech rights of nudists and discriminates against those who can not afford to obtain a city permit			0
while it may seem strange that going out in the buff is not already illegal in @entity2 , most @entity121 cities do not have local nudity laws , @entity14 said			2
' i suspect there are a lot of places that maybe do n't currently have a local law ( and ) that if people started getting naked every day would quickly see a local law , ' @entity14 said			0
if @entity14 's ban is passed , the violators will face a maximum penalty of a $ 100 fine for a first offense			1
but prosecutors would have authority to charge a third violation as a misdemeanor punishable by up to a $ 500 fine and a year in jail			1
exemptions would be made for participants at permitted street fairs and parades , such as the city 's annual gay pride event and the @entity147 , which celebrates sadomasochism and other sexual subcultures .			1

a third violation could mean a $ 500 fine and a year in jail
