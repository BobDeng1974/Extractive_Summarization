@entity0 insisted @entity1 had to take collective responsibility for their @entity4 embarrassment as he defended his team selection			1
@entity1 endured a night of humiliation against @entity7 and tumbled out after a 5 - 2 defeat ( 6 - 4 on aggregate ) in the @entity10			1
their performance was stained by defensive mistakes , with @entity13 particularly culpable			0
this was a night comparable to how @entity1 folded against @entity15 ( 2005 ) and @entity16 ( 2009 ) when they also conceded five times			2
@entity1 's @entity18 and @entity19 ( right ) look miserable during the painful defeat it made @entity0 's decision not to start @entity23 puzzling but the @entity1 manager maintained there was only a slight difference between the two teams and it was @entity28 's superior finishing that meant they reached the quarter - finals			1
' we did make some defensive mistakes but also there was some incredible finishing and sometimes you have to highlight the quality of that , ' said @entity0			2
' it is only natural and normal from the outside to look back , and i do not regret playing @entity13 - the defence has been strong in the last two games			0
@entity1 's @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 look dejected after @entity7 score their third ' we conceded only one goal from a corner in the first leg and kept a clean sheet against @entity50 on sunday , although we did not adapt too well to the pitch			1
' but it is a case of the whole team not defending well enough			0
i do not think it is down to the personnel , but as a team			0
@entity7 built a lot of momentum with their crowd rather than us being to blame			2
' @entity1 got back into the tie when @entity61 equalised @entity63 's opener but they fell asunder afterwards and @entity43 's late header provided no solace			0
@entity0 , though , was pleased that @entity1 kept searching for goal			1
@entity61 and @entity18 both look out of sorts as @entity1 crash out of @entity69 ' i am looking at the effort and the way we gave up , ' said @entity0			1
' we tried everything to stay in the tie but the way it unfolded was down to one team taking most of their chances ' sometimes the margins are so small and part of the experience in this competition is learning how to play the second leg			0
@entity86 looks at the ground in disappointment as @entity1 crashed out of the @entity4 @entity0 and substitute @entity89 remonstrate with the fourth official @entity90 ' both teams created a lot of chances and the difference was one team taking them			1
after the away goal i thought we would be tighter but it looked like they had a lot of belief and always looked a threat and like they could score a goal			0
the type of game it was there were opportunities for both teams			0

@entity1 were *beaten* 5 - 2 by @entity7 in the @entity10
the @entity1 lost 6 - 4 on aggregate and leave no @entity115 side left in the last eight of @entity69 competitions for the first time since 1993
@entity0 says @entity1 must take collective responsibility for their exit from @entity4
