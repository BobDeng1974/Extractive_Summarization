by @entity0 i have given in to an overwhelming number of requests to take the @entity5 challenge			1
bad timing really given that summer is now officially over and the country has avoided autumn this year and has instead jumped straight to freezing cold winter			0
just for anyone who has been living in a cave for the past month , the @entity9 is charity campaign to raise awareness and money to aid research into amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or as we call it here in the @entity18 , motor neurone disease			1
my latest nomination was from singer / charity campaigner @entity21 , but there have been several others , notably @entity22 and @entity23			1
so far the challenge has raised Â£ 48m pounds for research into the disease which affects the brain and the spinal cord causing motor neurons to die and leads to gradual paralysis and eventually death			0
there is no known cure for this terrible disease and seeing as i am a tv personality and not a neurosurgeon , the best thing i thought i could do to help was to throw a bucket of icy water over my head			1
if you are thinking of doing this challenge then please do it properly			0
pick a container large enough to bathe a small child			0
there needs to be much more than a couple of pints of freezing cold water - please note @entity60 and @entity21 - perhaps you would both care to do it again ? @entity63 and @entity64 did much better - both chose very decent sized containers of chilly water			1
a barman at @entity69 prepared a huge @entity71 bucket filled with a 50/50 mix of ice and water when i took my challenge i was doing a pr job for @entity79 's latest game @entity78 and i was at a very high - end club called @entity81 on @entity82			1
the barman picked out a wine cooler which contained barely over a pint , i refused			0
then a champagne bucket , still not big enough , then a magnum cooler , i pointed towards the rather huge @entity71 bucket			0
the bartender added a 50/50 mix of ice and water			1
i sat out on the pavement outside as the club did n't really want two gallons of icy cold water poured all over the floor just before their lunch - time service started			0
then the world 's coldest wet t - shirt competition began			0
it 's not the first time i 've had a cold drink thrown over me , as viewers of made in @entity101 will know , but this time at least it was for a good cause			2
and now i have nominated @entity23 , @entity23 and @entity23 to do their challenge in 24 hours , so let 's see if they can handle it			2
if you would like to donate to the motor neurone disease campaign please do go to @entity109 he has nominated @entity23 , @entity23 and @entity23 to do their challenge in 24 hours			2

@entity9 is campaign for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
