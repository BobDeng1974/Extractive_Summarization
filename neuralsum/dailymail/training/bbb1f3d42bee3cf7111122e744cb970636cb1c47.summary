click here to read the most damning allegations in the leaked @entity3 dossier @entity4 has never been one to follow the norm , and on tuesday night he chose one of the world ’s 100 most endangered buildings to launch the book charting the recent career of this endangered cricketer			1
the former @entity13 batsman found himself in a stunning @entity15 monastery set , incongruously , in the unfashionable @entity17 suburb of @entity18 to publicise the autobiography that has lit bonfires around the national team			1
this late 19th century building has long since ceased to be a place purely for religious contemplation - it is now rented out for assorted functions - but it still seemed an appropriate place for him to stop to consider the latest chapter in his colourful life			0
@entity4 , pictured during the last @entity31 series , has told his side of the story in his new autobiography @entity35 in @entity17 , one of the world 's most endangered buildings , where @entity4 spoke by the time @entity4 was introduced , in conversation with journalist @entity40 , he was being buffeted by the appearance of an @entity3 dossier , which had mysteriously appeared online to coincide with this book launch			1
tuesday night was the first event of what might , in reality , be the last concerted blast of publicity for the wandering batsman , good or bad			1
his resurrected profile in the past week saw a late surge in interest , and it was standing room only in the cloisters with @entity35 full to its 400 - capacity			0
supplementing their number , and paying for their tickets , were representatives from the @entity3 , including one of @entity63 friends in the governing body ’s employ , just to keep an eye on things			2
a dossier of information on @entity4 put together by the @entity3 has been revealed it was not long before @entity4 brought out the heavy roller with reference to the home board			1
‘ my character has been assassinated for five or six years by the @entity3 press machine , but i can go to bed at night and sleep easy , ’ he said			1
this was the first time that he had put himself in the court of public opinion , and he got a warm enough reception from the gathering of cricketing enthusiasts , although it was hardly the @entity83 treatment			0
the five - page section of the @entity3 dossier draft is marked strictly privileged and confidential after warming up , he lined up @entity87 in his sights , addressing the spinner ’s decision to leave the @entity31 tour after three tests , something he omits in the book			1
‘ do i think it ’s right he jumped ship ? no , i think he let the @entity13 team down			1
a lot of the players felt very aggrieved by him jumping ship mid-series			0
‘ if his elbow was an issue , fine , but i think he could have held on for a couple more weeks			0
’ never likely to escape was one of his main targets in the book , wicketkeeper and vice-captain @entity109 , and laughter broke out when the @entity112 label was brought up - ‘ the @entity113 who thinks he is @entity115 ’			2
a truncated round of applause broke out when he addressed the issue of @entity13 players being ‘ picked on ’			1
he said : ‘ everyone knew there was a bullying culture in that dressing room			0
a lot of players have texted me in the past 24 hours saying “ well done ”			0
’ as his answers echoed around this former place of worship with its glorious acoustics ( it was deconsecrated in 1989 ) , the audience hung on his words			0
whether people like @entity4 or not , they wanted to hear his every thought , even when credulity was stretched			2
‘ if there was a podium for egos in the @entity13 team , i would n’t be on it , ’ he insisted			1
sitting 30 yards beneath a giant crucifix hung from the ceiling , persecution for stating his beliefs was a recurring theme			0
it had been a long day of broadcast appearances and he sounded tired , and somewhat resigned to his fate with @entity13 : ‘ i live in hope and i know a lot of people will think i have no chance , maybe rightly so			2
’ he reiterated his regret about @entity154 , of how he added to @entity156 ’s stress as @entity13 captain , and how he apologised to the skipper ’s wife , @entity158			1
@entity160 spoke of his regret for adding to @entity156 's stress as captain of @entity13 and another thing he kicks himself for : ‘ watching an @entity167 match on the television while we ( @entity13 ) were batting - bad move			1
it sounds funny but it was n’t			0
’ it is one thing saying it in a book or on the radio , it is another saying it to a room of 400 people			2
the first 40 minutes of last night was serious stuff and somewhat joyless , not unlike much of the book			2
he seemed relieved to , latterly , get questions purely about his playing experiences			0
the mood lightened considerably when it was thrown open to the floor , with the people seemingly well - disposed towards him			0
a boy , announcing that he was 10 years old , asked what tips he might hand out about batting			0
‘ if it ’s up there , hit it into the car park , ’ replied @entity4			1
and for a fleeting moment it seemed like 2005 again , everyone eating out of his hand .			0
