not many people could drag us out of bed on a sunday morning when it is @entity4 outside			1
but , true to form , @entity6 drew a stellar crowd at her @entity9 show today including @entity10 , @entity11 and proud husband @entity12 , who sat front row next to the @entity21 editor - in - chief with their sons @entity17 , 15 , @entity18 , 12 , @entity19 , nine , and daughter @entity20 , three			1
the designer , 40 , seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this fall / winter 2015 collection			1
knits were the order of the day with slinky midi - length dresses opening the show			1
cool factor : @entity6 seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this fall / winter 2015 collection - there were lots of knits pale and interesting : the neutral palette , which included plenty of cream and taupe , showed just how luxurious winter white can look in a sophisticated neutral palette of cream , taupe , black and navy ( save a splash of orange and mustard yellow ) , the collection evolved into a dream winter wardrobe			1
@entity53 cream skirts , sweaters designed to hang ' just so ' , and calf - scraping culottes			2
in fact , the latter contributed to a touch of what we can only describe as @entity61 - chic , in the oversized proportions of the coats and jumbo buttons on the dresses - though clever tailoring kept silhouettes elegant			2
but , says mrs @entity6 in her show notes , ' it is not about one theme - but instead thinking about what women really want to wear and how they want their clothes to make them feel			2
' the shoes are certainly ' what women really want to wear			0
' following her footwear debut last season , these were designed by mrs @entity6 too			0
the calf - length boots came in black and beige and had substantial heels in which one could actually envisage stomping around @entity83			0
bright ideas : a pair of mustard yellow culottes and a vibrant orange coat were the designer 's only concessions to bold colour ' what women really want to wear ' : mrs @entity6 debuted a new footwear style ( left ) while bags were small and boxy ( right ) turn up the volume ! mrs @entity6 's oversized buttons and plays on proportion ( left ) called to mind costumes from the 1992 @entity100 children 's tv series @entity101 ( right ) though bags are an important category for mrs @entity6 's brand , there was less focus on them than in seasons past			1
we did see a few tiny boxy styles , almost small enough to fit in the palm of a model 's hand , and one sleek , minimal foldover number			0
the creative process for this collection , mrs @entity6 says in her notes , was a little different from usual			0
' i began with the dress and looked at evolving and translating it , ' she wrote			0
' it was from here that the collection and its narrative developed and it has been liberating and surprising for me in terms of the creative process			0
' familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked			0
volumes have been subverted , menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists , spirals , seams and asymmetry interplayed			0
fabrics bounce and move , a swing is sculptural , and a more body conscious silhouette emerges ... ' for me it is a collection full of possibilities			0
' flower power : the final looks included asymmetric skirts seemingly assembled of iridescent petals future perfect : in a sophisticated neutral palette of cream , taupe , black and navy , the collection evolved into a dream winter wardrobe take a bow : the designer was greeted by applause when she stepped out from backstage after the show family affair : mrs @entity6 's husband , @entity12 , sat front row next to @entity21 editor - in - chief @entity11			1
daughter @entity20 , three , sat on his lap , and sons @entity17 , 15 , @entity18 , 12 and @entity19 , nine , to his right			2
ms @entity11 was joined by her daughter , @entity162 ( pictured far right ) also at @entity9 ... by @entity163 at @entity9 for @entity164 @entity6 was n't the only @entity166 - based designer to show at @entity9 this weekend			1
@entity168 's creative director @entity167 , who is originally from @entity169 , @entity170 , presented a beautiful fall / winter 2015 collection inspired by @entity170 @entity21 fashion spreads from the @entity173 and late @entity175 glamour at @entity176 in downtown @entity177			1
instead of a runway show , however , models posed on boxes covered in large sheets of canvas fabric , like an exquisite painting brought to life			2
a velvet - looking maroon corduroy suit worn with a lacy green shirt sparked nostalgia for the @entity175 , while sophisticated evening looks - a black midlength tube skirt decorated with sequined fringe detail at the hem ( like the bottom of a delicate chandelier ) and a slinky pink satin slip dress with a knotted bow on the waist - recalled @entity173 glamour			2
the exotic dark plum lipstick also helped			0
painterly : @entity168 presented a beautiful fall / winter 2015 collection inspired by @entity21 from the @entity173 and late @entity175 glamour			1

the designer drew a stellar crowd for her show on sunday morning , including @entity11 , @entity10 and of course husband @entity12 who sat front row with their four children
cosy knits were the order of the day for fall / winter 2015 , in a sophisticated palette of neutrals
