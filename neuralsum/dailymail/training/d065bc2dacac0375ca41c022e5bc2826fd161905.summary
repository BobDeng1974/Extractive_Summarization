by @entity0 published : 08:12 est , 25 february 2013 updated : 20:35 est , 25 february 2013 ruling : property investor @entity1 , pictured outside @entity4 's @entity3 , has been refused permission to appeal his divorce it was only a tiff about a woman ’s ability to map - read			1
but property investor @entity1 ’s ten - year marriage appears to have lost its way the day he argued with his wife over her navigational skills			2
the couple took a wrong turn in @entity16 while driving along back - roads to @entity18 on a wine - tasting holiday			2
mr @entity1 stopped the car and clashed with his wife @entity21 over her ability to plan the route			1
and although the disagreement lasted only ‘ a matter of moments ’ , it would later form a plank of mrs @entity30 ’s successful bid to divorce him			0
yesterday mr @entity1 lost a costly legal battle against the decision to end the marriage – despite a judge admitting he had similar rows with his own wife			1
@entity4 ’s @entity3 heard that mr @entity1 , 60 , went on the @entity16 trip with @entity21 , a 51 - year - old company director , two summers ago			1
judge @entity41 granted the couple a decree nisi in december – and revealed that he and his own wife also argued about map - reading			0
but mr @entity1 , of @entity45 , @entity4 , claimed the judge was wrong to accept his wife ’s account that the map - reading clash was one of many			1
he also maintained the marriage had not irretrievably broken down			0
so yesterday he asked another judge , @entity52 , to overturn the decision and give him the opportunity to breathe life into a marriage he insisted was not dead			0
although he admitted having the row , he denied acting unreasonably and also objected to being ordered to pay his wife ’s £ 20,000 legal bill			0
he told the court : ‘ there was nothing on which the judge could conclude that my wife could not be reasonably expected to live with me			0
i believe as i stand here that the marriage has not irretrievably broken down			0
mr @entity1 was refused permission to appeal his divorce at a hearing at the @entity3 , in the @entity71 ( pictured ) ‘ she said that there had been lots of arguments between us , but she never mentioned any arguments to the judge when asked a direct question , apart from one about map reading on the way to a wine tasting in @entity16			1
‘ i conceded that the argument about map reading had happened and the judge said he and his wife argued about map reading			2
’ refusing mr @entity1 permission to appeal , however , @entity52 said of the earlier hearing : ‘ the conclusion of the judge was that the marriage had irretrievably broken down			1
‘ it is sad , as it seems to me , that this couple have spent far more energy and wasted far more money than was ever necessary had there been a more realistic assessment of where they stood and how to bring their failed marriage to an end			0
’ mr @entity1 ’s ex-wife was not at court yesterday and was not represented .			2
