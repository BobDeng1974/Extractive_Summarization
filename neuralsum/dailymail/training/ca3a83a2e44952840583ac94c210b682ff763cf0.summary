few @entity14 journalists have ever visited the open - cast mine in @entity3 's @entity16 - and with reason			2
it spews out 420,000 cubic feet of toxic gas for every ton of rare metal mined , along with acidic waste water and radioactive material			0
@entity26 's @entity25 satellite has captured the growth of the secretive facility over five years - as @entity3 aims to stockpile rare earths to gain an economic advantage against the @entity31			1
[ caption rare - earths are so - called because when they were first discovered in the @entity35 in @entity36 , they were believed to be some of the most uncommon elements.but through further scientific discovery , rare - earths have been found to be relatively abundant in the @entity39 's crust			0
however , the high cost of extraction means that only areas with rich deposits are worth @entity45 - earth metals are typically malleable			1
they also have high electrical @entity47 are often extracted from minerals through a process that involves dissolving elements in different liquids - usually water and a @entity53 are 17 rare - earths and their purposes include being used in shielding for nuclear reactors , fibre optics , flatscreen displays and earthquake monitoring equipment			0
in 2008 , @entity3 supplied 139,000 tons worldwide , 97 per cent of the world 's total rare - earth production			1
the architect of modern @entity3 , @entity62 , realised the significance of the elements lurking in the arid wastes of @entity16 almost 20 years ago when he said : ' there is oil in the @entity68 but there is rare - earth in @entity3			2
' with names like cerium , lanthanum , and ytterbium , rare earth elements are n’t exactly household names			2
but the consumer products they are used in - such as magnets , camera lenses , and batteries - certainly @entity77 are 17 rare earth elements in all , but these key metals are n’t as rare as the name suggests			1
( in fact , some are relatively abundant in @entity39 ’s crust			0
) the vast majority of rare earths — 96 percent of the market — come from @entity3			0
@entity3 has a stranglehold on the global supply of 17 rare earth materials essential for making high - end goods such as hybrid cars , camera lenses , mobile phones and weapons			1
about half come from @entity2 , a single mine			2
on july 2 , 2001 ( below ) and june 30 , 2006 ( above ) , the @entity101 ( @entity101 ) on @entity26 ’s @entity25 satellite acquired these false - color views of the mine in the @entity105 appears red , grassland is light brown , rocks are black , and water surfaces are green			1
two circular open - pit mines are visible , as well as a number of tailings ponds and tailings piles			0
use the image comparison tool to see how the mine has grown larger since 2001			0
according to a @entity117 ( @entity117 ) report , @entity3 produced about 81,000 tons of rare earth metals in 2001 ; the number jumped to about 120,000 by @entity120 an intensive mining operation has a definite impact on the surrounding environment			1
according to the @entity124 of @entity125 , 9,600 to 12,000 cubic meters ( 340,000 to 420,000 cubic feet ) of waste gas — containing dust concentrate , hydrofluoric acid , sulfur dioxide , and sulfuric acid — are released with every ton of rare metals that are mined			0
approximately 75 cubic meters ( 2,600 cubic feet ) of acidic wastewater , plus about a ton of radioactive waste residue are also produced			0
around 100 miles south of @entity137 , larger rare - earth refineries sit around the banks of the world 's largest tailing lake , @entity141 - seven square miles of evil - smelling toxic waste that shows the shocking extent of this industry 's impact			1
a @entity25 satellite image ( captured july 2 , 2001 ) of @entity3 's @entity2 mine located in @entity3 's @entity16 , showing two circular open - pit mines , a number of tailings ponds and tailings piles			1
vegetation appears red , grassland light is brown , rocks are black , and water surfaces are green			0
according to a @entity117 report , the @entity156 has enough rare earth elements in the ground to meet global demand for decades to come			2
but until @entity164 ’s @entity163 recently reopened , few of these minerals were being mined in the @entity156			0

one single mine produces half the world 's supply of ' rare earth ' metals

two pictures captured five years apart show huge growth of mine facility
few *westerners* have ever visited mine for metals crucial to electronics
