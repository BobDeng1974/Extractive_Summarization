@entity0 and stable jockey @entity1 walked away from @entity2 after turning the @entity3 into a virtual closed shop			1
combined success with @entity6 in the @entity7 and the @entity8 with @entity9 took @entity0 ’ tally to six in the 19 races run over the three days			1
@entity1 took his haul to seven when winning the concluding @entity12 on @entity14 - trained @entity13			1
stable jockey @entity1 ( far right ) and @entity0 ( far left ) celebrate @entity16 's success at the @entity17 at @entity18 @entity1 ’s feat – he was only eligible to ride in 17 of the races - matched that of @entity22 , who won seven races at the meeting in 2001			1
@entity0 , who had sent out @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 to win on friday plus @entity28 on saturday , could n’t quite match the achievement of @entity30 – he produced seven open meeting winners in 2001 , 2002 and 2004 – but his reward is to be sitting at the top of a trainers ’ championship table most expected to be a three - cornered fight between @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity39			1
@entity0 said : ‘ before the meeting started i said i would settle for two winners and @entity1 said three			1
to have six is phenomenal			2
‘ i could not have imagined it in my wildest dreams			2
it was borderline whether we ran today ’s two winners because we thought it might be too soft for them			2
we will enjoy it while we can			2
’ the @entity50 could prove the ultimate aim for 7 - 2 winner @entity9 , who held off favourite @entity54 on whom jockey @entity56 seemed to overdo the waiting tactics			0
@entity1 holds the trophy after winning the @entity61 on day three of @entity17 after his heroics for new boss @entity37 on saturday when winning the @entity64 on @entity65 , it will not be the last blip on a learning curve and @entity37 must equally acknowledge he has invested for the future in a young talent			1
@entity0 , whose understated demeanour often means his successes do not achieve the attention they deserve , brushed off any notion @entity6 may be a @entity75 outsider by saying the 10 - 1 winner was ‘ about 20lbs ’ below the standard required			0
action more pertinent to that race took place at @entity81 where @entity82 proved there is still life in his 10 - year - old legs with third consecutive win in the @entity87 when beating reigning champion @entity88 two and a half lengths			0
@entity93 ’s @entity92 , under an exquisite front - running @entity91 ride , landed the @entity94			0
@entity95 make him 16 - 1 for the @entity97			0
but attention in that division is of stars trying to overcome problems			0
we should find out after a bone scan on tuesday if reigning champion @entity104 has suffered a hairline pelvic fracture or less serious muscle pull while @entity38 said 2013 title holder @entity108 , sidelined last term by a fibrillating heart , will have a racecourse gallop before being given the go ahead to run in the @entity112 at @entity113 on december 6			0
@entity38 said : ‘ he has had his mot and heart-wise everything is fine			0

@entity117 reigned victorious on the third day at @entity2
@entity1 has won seven races out of 19 during the last few days
that matches the same feat achieved by @entity22 in 2001
