by @entity0 @entity1 uses photos to search for similar - looking animals in the local area that are up for adoption if cloning your recently deceased pet is a step too far , an app will now find an almost near replica			1
called @entity1 , it uses images of either an old pet , an animal that belongs to a friend , or just a favourite breed to search for similar ones nearby			1
the app only searches for animals that are up for adoption in the user ’s local area , and as a result the service is only available in certain areas			1
@entity1 was launched by @entity28 start - up @entity26 , which specialises in image search algorithms			1
animals lovers upload a photo to @entity1 , or use a sample image from the gallery , and the app will search a database of pets for animals with similar features			1
it uses @entity26 ’s patented image recognition technology to perform what ’s called geometric analysis			1
this includes scanning images to plot and match the distance between the animal ’s eyes , the angle of its mouth , its face shape and its colour			2
users can then browse a list of potential matches before clicking through to a profile and learning more about the dog , and the centre where it is up for adoption			2
these results can be filtered by similarity or distance , and favourite images can be stored for later			0
