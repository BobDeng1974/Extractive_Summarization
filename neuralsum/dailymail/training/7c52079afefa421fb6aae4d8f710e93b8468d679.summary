the tiger 's latest victim was an unidentified woman who was found in a forest tuesday in @entity10 , @entity3 yesterday			1
the female tiger is believed to be prowling over an area covering around 80 miles and is considered to be far more dangerous than others in the area due to a lack of hunting experience that forces the desperate cat to move closer to human occupation			2

@entity3 is home to some 1,700 tigers - half of the world 's rapidly shrinking wild tiger population - but has been struggling to halt the big cat 's decline in the face of poachers , international smuggling networks and loss of habitat			1
