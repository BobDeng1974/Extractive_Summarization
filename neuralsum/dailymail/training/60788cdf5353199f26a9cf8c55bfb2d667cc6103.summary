by @entity0 the softness of the dustbag , the crush of the sugar paper as you unwrap it , then , finally , that unmistakeable scent of real leather - there ’s something undeniably luxurious about the first touch of a designer handbag			1
and for most of us , such bags are the single designer item in our wardrobes - carefully stored among the fail - safe @entity17 trousers , sturdy @entity19 dresses and trendy @entity20 tops			1
the perfect once - in - a - lifetime investment or birthday gift , a quality designer handbag will not just stand the test of time , but look good whether you ’re a size 8 or 18 , and add a slick of polish to any @entity31 outfit			1
@entity44 ’s instantly recognisable and versatile @entity43 , for example , has increased by 70 per cent , to £ 2,740 , in just five years			1
a natural leather @entity47 , meanwhile , that cost £ 650 in early 2012 is now £ 895			2
an @entity49 clutch , which cost £ 845 in 2012 , will now set you back £ 995			2
and it ’s not just at the very top of the market that prices are climbing rapidly			1
even brands such as @entity57 ’s favourite , coach , which has traditionally sold bags with starting points of £ 200 to £ 300 - and enjoyed double - digit sales gains during the recession - are increasing their prices			1
in 2009 , @entity56 was hailing its bright , breezy @entity64 range - which combined colourful canvas , denim and leather - as a recession - proof bargain			1
but now it has hired @entity72 accessories maestro @entity71 , formerly of @entity73 and @entity74 , it has started throwing around figures that make @entity44 look modest			1
‘ you can have a £ 3,000 , £ 1,500 or £ 1,200 coach bag in the future , ’ the brand ’s chairman @entity76 recently told @entity79 fashion industry bible @entity80			0
unless it is fashioning these bags from gold , how can brands possibly justify prices rising so high ? the simple answer is that the more accessible the ‘ average ’ shopper finds handbags , the less appealing they are to the very rich , who would prefer something a little more exclusive			1
and the big fashion houses are very , very busy chasing the very rich ; specifically the roubles of the billionaire @entity97 oligarchs and the yuan of @entity100 super-consumers			0
‘ there are a lot of extremely rich people in countries such as @entity100 and @entity97 , while in the @entity110 the wealthy have seen their incomes rising far faster than the rest of us , ’ says fashion and retail consultant @entity101 , until recently editor - in - chief at leading fashion forecaster @entity103			0
the price of @entity49 's bags have increased by 18 %			1
costs going up means average middle - class consumers are unable to afford them ‘ this has created a market where shoppers do n’t think twice about paying £ 1,000 - plus for a bag — and buying a new one every season			0
’ for some brands , however , moving too far upmarket has backfired , most notably in the case of @entity73			1
just over a week ago , its ceo - and the man chiefly credited with the decision to take the brand upmarket - @entity132 , resigned			0
@entity73 ’s share price had plummeted 60 per cent in two years , wiping millions from the value of the company			1
commentators believe the move backfired as most of the company ’s customers , some two - thirds it is estimated , are @entity72			0
and those customers , according to tv fashion commentator and personal stylist @entity143 , feel abandoned by the brands they have trusted for years			1
‘ they ’re alienating the core middle - class customer , ’ she says			0
‘ they ’ve abandoned the middle market , which just wants quality and style at a decent price			2
as you get a bit older , you want nice things			0
but if you have worked hard to afford them , you also want value for money			0
instead , you ’ve got @entity44 bags at £ 2,500			1
’ @entity159 once sold a bag for £ 75,000			0
it was made of matt crocodile and anti-scratch calf leather the design houses themselves claim that the rising cost of leather twinned with additional costs in production are to blame			0
‘ essentially , the whole world now wants real leather , from the @entity31 up to @entity44			1
but there are only so many cows to produce it , ’ says @entity170 , a trends analyst			0
@entity73 cites this as one of the reasons its prices have risen , along with its ongoing return of production to @entity72			2
it had been producing around 80 per cent of its leather goods in @entity186 , but now is aiming to make at least 50 per cent on @entity72 soil , having just opened a new factory in @entity189			2
but mrs middle - @entity190 can no longer afford it			0
@entity193 , 67 , a retired office administrator from @entity194 , @entity195 , has been buying ‘ posh handbags ’ for years - she now has about 40 - but as prices climb towards £ 1,000 , she knows she will now have to forego her annual luxury purchase.her first @entity73 tote cost around £ 500 when she bought it a couple of years ago , and it was n’t long before she ’d bought another			1
there are still some advantages to investing in a top - end designer item , such as this @entity206 bag ‘ i took a big gulp at the cash register , but i ’ve used them every day and they always look good , ’ says @entity193			2
‘ a really beautiful handbag elevates an outfit , even if you ’re dressed casually			0
but i ’d need to have a very , very , very good reason to pay £ 900 for one			0
some brands have forgotten about their old customers as they go after international jetsetters			2
’ for so many of the international rich , status is king			0
boutiques in prestigious streets , limited runs in rare leathers , collaborations with stars			0
it all adds to the cost , and it ’s all in the name of exclusivity			0
‘ there are enough people who will just pay the extra and not notice , but there are also people who will actually feel better for having paid more , ’ says @entity170			0
‘ that ’s essentially who @entity44 , @entity235 and their like are appealing to			1
’ while luxury handbag prices soar out of our price range , other brands are jostling to fill the mid-market gap : @entity243 set out to design a mid-priced must - have with its lovely @entity244 ( designed by the actress @entity246 ) last year , which starts at £ 350 ; and @entity248 and @entity249 are both contesting the £ 500 - ground vacated by @entity73			1
certainly , while @entity56 ’s prices remain ( reasonably ) reasonable , it seems it can expect sales figures to rise			1
@entity254 , head of women ’s accessories at @entity257 , says , ‘ we have seen a significant uplift in mid to premium - priced bags			0
‘ coach only launched at @entity257 in october but we expect to see growth of almost 40 per cent for the last quarter , while other brands such as @entity264 have seen a 360 per cent uplift versus last season			1
’ now @entity268 brands are getting in on the bag - flation act , too			2
whereas just a few years ago , you could easily find a decent leather bag on the @entity31 for around £ 60 , now @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity19 , @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity20 and even @entity277 are all ramping up prices to the £ 150 to £ 300 mark - prices most people would only be comfortable paying for something decidedly more premium			1
nevertheless , there are still some advantages to investing in a top - end designer bag , if you can afford it			2
the resale value on a well cared - for bag can be astonishing			0
in may 2012 , a crocodile @entity291 fetched £ 40,000 at auction			0
after all , for handbag conoisseurs such as @entity193 , the purchase of a bag is not about the name or the price , but ‘ the pleasure i get from it ’ .			2
