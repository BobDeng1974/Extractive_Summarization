with an election ahead and the weight of expectation upon him , @entity0 needs all the support he can get ... and so did his knees yesterday			0
@entity8 , the prime minister wore support bandages on both legs – and , observers noted , perhaps a little extra padding of the natural variety elsewhere on his body too – as he got a soaking during a race along a swollen icy stream in the @entity18			1
mr @entity0 , 48 , tackled the annual fund - raising competition , known as the @entity20 , close to his constituency home in @entity23 , @entity24			1
with mud smeared on his face , @entity0 enjoyed a pint after crawling the icy water to get under a low bridge during the charity fun run the prime minister gave a thumbs up to photographers as he crawled through the tunnel the prime minister wore knee pads to prevent a repeat of the cut he sustained in the @entity20 in @entity39 in 2012 with mud smeared on his face , mr @entity0 came close to losing his footing as he ran through the stream the cross-country event is raced for half its mile length in the stream itself close to the village of @entity39			1
perhaps it was just as well he took extra precautions yesterday as , face smeared with mud , he crawled under a bridge and stumbled through the water , almost losing his footing at one point			0
but at least there was little danger of cuts – to mr @entity0 ’s knees , that is , thanks to the extra layer protecting them			0
a @entity63 source said : ‘ he took the precaution of using the knee supports this year for protection from sharp stones submerged in the water			2
’ the race is held every year in the @entity18 village during the @entity71 break as a chance to run off the excess of the festive season every competitor gets a medal for taking part in the race , which has the slogan : ‘ @entity79			1
have a pint ’ mr @entity0 's wife @entity81 stayed warm and dry in a grey winter coat and matching scarf the run ’s safety manual warns : ‘ the brook is cold , parts of it are up to 3ft deep			1
there are many hidden rocks and tree roots which can be a trip hazard			0
’ despite looking a little breathless at times , mr @entity0 completed the course			0
he finished 64th out of 141 runners , with a time of 14 minutes , 12 seconds , organiser @entity96 said last night from the @entity100 in @entity39 , where many competitors recuperate after the run			1
mr @entity0 was congratulated by his wife @entity81 , who stayed warm and dry in a grey winter coat and scarf while watching the race , as he enjoyed a refreshing pint of beer			2
she was on hand for moral support after the race 's conclusion , with spectators looking on mr @entity0 lined up with other runners this morning , after taking part previously in 2012 and 2009 the @entity20 , which was first held in 2006 , starts and ends at the @entity100 in @entity39 and aims to raise funds for local good causes the race , which raises money for the local primary school and costs £ 5 to enter , was first run in 2006			1
organisers say that every runner ‘ no matter how c * * p ’ gets a medal			2
in 2008 , the first year mr @entity0 competed , he finished 25th out of more than 100 competitors – and did not wear a support bandage on either knee			0
in 2009 , his knees were unsupported too			0
but at his next appearance in the event in 2012 he wore a support bandage on his right knee and finished 46th out of a field of 109 ( a few places behind a man dressed as @entity71 ) with a time of 18 minutes , 23 seconds .			0
