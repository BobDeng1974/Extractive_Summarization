by @entity1 reporter last updated at 6:42 pm on 20th june 2011 the death penalty carries a heavy price in @entity4 , and not just to those executed			1
the legal practice also costs taxpayers billions , at a time when the state languishes under crushing debt			0
@entity12 taxpayers have spent more than $ 4 billion on capital punishment in since it was reinstated there in 1978 , or about $ 308 million for each of the 13 executions carried out there since then , according to a new report			1
walking dead : a prisoner on @entity21 is led back to his cell in @entity4 's @entity23 in 2003			1
due to legal challenges and long delays , the state has n't executed anyone since 2006 , despite a crowded death row the analysis by a senior federal judge and a law professor estimated that the additional costs of capital trials , security on death row and legal representation through long appeals for the condemned adds $ 184 million to the budget each year , reports the @entity39			1
the study 's authors , @entity41 9th circuit judge @entity40 and @entity43 professor @entity42 , predicted that the death penalty will cost @entity4 $ 9 billion by 2030 , when death row will house more than 1,000 condemned inmates			1
for their report ' executing the @entity50 : a roadmap to @entity53 or end the @entity55 's @entity54 ' , the authors examined previously unavailable records from the @entity57			0
mr @entity40 and ms @entity42 suggested three options to reduce the ballooning costs of capital punishment : fully preserve the practice with $ 85 million more in funding each year ; reduce the number of death penalty - eligible crimes for an annual savings of $ 55 million ; or abolish capital punishment and save taxpayers about $ 1 billion every five or six years , reports the @entity39			1
former death chamber : the gas chamber at @entity23 , seen in 2006 , has n't been used since 1996			2

he said he does not oppose the controversial death penalty and believes @entity4 voters do want to keep it as an option			0
ms @entity96 is his long - time law clerk , though she says she favours eliminating capital punishment in her state			1
even so , both authors claim they approached their report as impartial academics , focused on the economics of the issue			0
four years ago , mr @entity40 pointed out that it took an average of 17 years from conviction to execution in @entity4 , two times the national average			0
now , it takes longer than 25 years , and no executions have taken place in the state since 2006 , despite a crowding death row that now numbers 714 inmates			1
no executions are likely in the near future , according to the @entity39 , due to legal challenges to the state 's lethal injection procedures			2
the report stated : this ' reflects a wholesale failure to fund the efficient , effective capital punishment system that @entity4 voters were told they were choosing ' in the battery of voter initiatives over the last three decades that have expanded the penalty to 39 special circumstances in murder			1
executed : @entity130 ( left ) was executed at @entity23 in january 2006 ( at age 76 ) for the murder of three people			0

the death penalty remains controversial unless major reforms are made , the authors claim ' capital punishment will continue to exist mostly in theory while exacting an untenable cost ' , writes the @entity39			1
among their findings to be published next week in the @entity43 of @entity157 : the state 's 714 death row prisoners cost $ 184 million more per year than those sentenced to life in prison without parole			1
a death penalty prosecution costs up to 20 times as much as a life - without - parole case			0
the least expensive death penalty trial costs $ 1.1 million more than the most expensive life - without - parole case			2
jury selection in a capital case runs three to four weeks longer and costs $ 200,000 more than in life - without - parole cases			2
the state pays up to $ 300,000 for attorneys to represent each capital inmate on appeal			2
@entity23 : federal judges have found fault with about 70 % of the state 's death row convictions , sending them back to trial courts			0
@entity4 also has a lack of lawyers who are experienced in death row appeals cases death row inmates play basketball and stand around in the crowded exercise yard of @entity189 during a rare tour of @entity23 in 2003 the heightened security practices mandated for death row inmates added $ 100,663 to the cost of incarcerating each capital prisoner last year , for a total of $ 72 million			1
the study echoes findings by the bipartisan @entity198 on the fair administration of justice in 2008 and a 2009 report by the @entity201 of @entity4			0
there is a lack of death penalty - qualified attorneys in @entity4 , perhaps only 100 , which leads to long delays			2
federal judges have found fault with about 70 % of the state 's death row convictions , sending them back to trial courts			0
the report claims voters have not been apprised of the real costs of capital punishment over the years			2
