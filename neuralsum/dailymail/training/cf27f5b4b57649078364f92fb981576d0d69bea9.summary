@entity0 believes @entity1 has turned a corner			2
after six months in @entity4 , the @entity3 is slowly beginning to look and sound like a @entity6 manager			1
no 3 in the first - team coaching set - up , former @entity7 central defender @entity0 was as in the dark about @entity1 as everyone else at first			1
he knew little or nothing about the man he was asked to work with			2
unheralded and unproven outwith @entity3 football , @entity1 seemed almost overwhelmed by the demands of his new job in those early days			1
a casual drink in a @entity4 pub at the end of the night became an ordeal			2
posing for pictures became an invasive way of life			2
@entity1 has turned things around at @entity7 following a slow start on the field , his system was unfamiliar to the players , results hinting at a lack of understanding between the manager and his charges			1
as @entity33 approaches , however , @entity6 are three points clear at the top of the @entity36			1
the air of crisis has passed – for now - and @entity1 looks to be finding his feet			2
they could always score more goals – notably so against @entity42 on saturday			2
yet , since a 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity44 in october , @entity6 have now kept five clean sheets in seven league games			1
‘ sometimes it looks as though it ’s stuttering along and question marks start , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ but , in recent weeks , you can see a team that ’s fully committed to what the manager is trying to do			2
once you get that things can only move forward			0
’ @entity1 was named the @entity55 for november after four - straight wins the ideas were radical at first			0
@entity1 brought many of his own fitness and analysis staff over from @entity3			1
the diet was famously overhauled and sports scientist @entity62 was promoted to the first team			0
the blunt truth is that some still do n’t care for this stuff			0
a change of culture and philosophy is an unsettling business and some of the existing staff and players will inevitably leave because they have n’t bought into it			1
for his part , @entity0 is convinced by the changes made so far			0
‘ @entity1 was new to me , as well , when he came in , ’ he continued			0
‘ initially , he was finding his feet , and the thing that catches people off guard is the magnitude and size of the club , the focus that ’s on them every day			0
‘ he ’s certainly settled in , he ’s the right type of character for this type of job and he has all the players on board for where he wants to go			1
first - team coach @entity0 ( right ) believes the players are buying into @entity1 's methods ‘ i think we ’re beginning to see more and more of that			1
at first , it ’s always the same - a new manager with new ideas and things take time			0
‘ he has n’t changed his style in the dressing room			0
he can be heated when he wants to be and really enthusiastic when he wants to but generally he ’s very calm and thoughtful about what he ’s trying to do			0
‘ he does n’t get too worked up and he makes sure that when the players go out on the pitch , whether that be before the match or at half - time , he ’s very clear about what he wants			1
’ there are times , most notably after away victories , when @entity1 does become worked up			0
@entity1 has developed a bond with @entity6 supporters after his post-match fist - pumping displays after the 1 - 0 win over @entity42 on saturday , the @entity6 coach indulged in another of the first pumping displays of bonding with the travelling support which have become his new practice			1
if it seems a little forced at times , there is method in his actions			0
the supporters like to see a manager – especially an outsider – display passion for their club			0
‘ you obviously also have to have the character and everything else to drive the players on , which he ’s got , but at the right time he ’s got a calm head to make sure that he is clear in his instructions , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ from my perspective , it ’s been a fantastic learning curve working under him			0
he is very specific in what he wants from us all and he certainly makes sure that in training every day he drums it into the players what he wants on pitch at match time			2
@entity149 scored the only goal of the game in saturday 's 1 - 0 win at @entity42 ‘ it has probably taken time but certainly from my perspective we ’re beginning to see that			2
’ the process of change has not all been one way			0
an idealist at heart , @entity1 began life as @entity6 manager with a dogged attitude to how his teams should play the game			1
the 4 - 2 - 3 - 1 formation has never altered – he wo n’t change that – but there is an acceptance now that he will only be given the time to change things if he is winning games			2
altering a culture while carving out results is a tricky balancing act			0
thursday ’s @entity177 game with @entity178 – @entity6 are already in the last 32 - offers a rare opportunity to try things without having to win the match			1
@entity1 has won over @entity6 supporters after finally getting things right on the pitch and yet , still , people will expect a performance and result of an acceptable standard			1
for @entity1 , this has been the biggest lesson of all at @entity7			1
‘ winning is the big thing at @entity6 , ’ added @entity0			1
‘ if you go two matches without winning all of a sudden the question marks come out - but that ’s the nature of the beast and that will never change			0
‘ when you are the manager or a player , you just have to have the mentality to deal with that and that ’s something he knows about now			0
he ’s well aware that when we do n’t play well just make sure you still win the match			0
‘ performance-wise , you want to win with style - but when that style does n’t come across in a specific game just make sure you win it and move on			0
