fearless leader : the raid was led by lt col @entity99 the toast ritual grew from early get - togethers led by @entity102 , who died in 1993			1
' it is a very private moment , ' said @entity52 , a @entity28 native who lives in @entity104 , @entity105			1
' you remember the ones who did n't make it , you think about them , and you are sorry they are n't with us			1
and then the ones fortunate to still be living trade off stories			1
' the stories are many , their bond forged in a daring mission			1
' i did n't expect to survive			1
we should have been shot down , ' said @entity57 , 92 , a @entity121 , @entity120 , native who lives in @entity122 , @entity123			1

' @entity127 , from @entity128 , @entity129 , got top - secret briefings with pilot @entity131 in @entity123 , just five months after the @entity24 attack on @entity76			1
' we needed to hit back , ' recalled @entity55 , now 95 and living near @entity135			1
once at sea , the rest learned targets - factories , plants , military facilities on mainland @entity142			2

@entity102 's plane took off first at 08:20 from a pitching carrier deck			2
' it 's the @entity186 , ' said historian @entity187			2
' they know that a betting man would probably bet against them ... brave heroism in the face of an enemy that at that time was winning the war			2
' they flew low in radio silence , skimming seas and then treetops			2
@entity52 recalls the country song ' @entity199 ' running through his head			2
he tapped his foot in time until @entity102 shot him a questioning look			2

' at that point , col. @entity102 said to open up the bomb bay doors			2
' the bombs dropped , ' and we got the heck out of there			2
