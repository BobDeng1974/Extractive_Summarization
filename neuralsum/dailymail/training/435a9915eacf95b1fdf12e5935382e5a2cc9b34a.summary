by @entity0 in @entity1 , @entity2 published : 07:54 est , 11 october 2012 updated : 15:38 est , 11 october 2012 @entity3 hopes to deliver a knockout blow to president @entity6 's hopes of re-election tonight against @entity8 who expects to come at him ' like a cannonball '			1
@entity3 has been taking time out from his workouts to prepare assiduously for tonight 's vice-presidential debate in @entity1 , @entity2 with both camps predicting a muscular showdown between the two campaign attack dogs			2
if the pictures in the next edition of @entity17 of the vice-presidential candidate working out last year are anything to go by , he 's at least in physical shape for the showdown			0
tough guy : @entity3 , pictured here demonstrating his workout technique last year , is hoping to deliver a knockout blow to @entity6 's re-election hopes tonight			2
photo credit : @entity27 for @entity17 @entity3 said this week he expects @entity8 to come swinging for him from the off after @entity6 's disastrous presidential debate last week : ' what was wrong with @entity6 ? i do n't know			1
it was really something , ' @entity3 said			0
' president @entity6 was flustered			2
he has a terrible record to run on			0
it ’s pretty indefensible as witnessed by the fact that he did n’t do a very good job of defending it last night			0
' ' that means the focus is going to be on @entity8 , ' @entity3 said , ' and i expect the vice president to come at me like a cannonball			1
he ’ll be in full attack mode , and i do n’t think he ’ll let any inconvenient facts get in his way			0
' brains and brawn : @entity3 is seen as the intellectual superior to @entity8			2
photo credit : @entity27 for @entity17 at the same time , @entity3 aides have said their man will be aggressive , accusing @entity8 of misrepresenting his record			1
@entity8 this morning joked with reporters about his strategy , saying : ' you ever see me rope - a - dope ? ' while the @entity61 campaign has been publicly playing down the chances of representative @entity3 , chairman of the @entity63 , scoring a major victory in the vice-presidential debate , privately hopes are high that he could do very well			1
advisor : @entity3 today tweeted this picture of him hugging one of his sons as he prepares for the showdown @entity8 , who was a senator for 36 years , is legendarily verbose and prone to verbal slips which have been a boon to the @entity61 campaign - most particularly when he said @entity73 wanted to ' put y'all back in chains ' and when he said the middle class had been ' buried ' under @entity6			1
@entity3 , just 42 , is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new @entity73 generation , a policy expert steeped in the minutiae of the economy and who entered @entity83 in 1999 when he was just 28 - two years younger then @entity8 was when he became a senator in 1972			1
feeling good : @entity73 are more confident than @entity85 going into the vice presidential debate @entity8 is expected to assail @entity3 on his own budget plans in the @entity63			1
but @entity3 , who has fallen in line with @entity61 on policy issues , will want to keep the focus on his running mate			1
' you have to remember this is a @entity61 - @entity3 ticket , and there 's one presidential candidate , there 's one person at the top of the ticket , ' @entity61 spokesman @entity92 told reporters			1
a new @entity103 poll has found that voters view @entity8 less favourably than @entity3 and much worse than they did when he debated the 2008 @entity73 vice- presidential candidate @entity105			1
by a 40 per cent to a 34 per cent margin , voters expect @entity3 to beat @entity8 at their thursday debate in @entity1 , @entity2			1
among independents , 42 to 25 per cent believe @entity3 will win			2
this could create an expectations problem for @entity3 - much as was the case for @entity6 , who was heavily favoured by voters before he was trounced by @entity61 in the first presidential debate in @entity115			1
at the weekend , @entity3 said of @entity8 : ' he 's fast on the cuff , he 's a witty guy			2
he knows who he is and he 's been doing this for 40 years			0
so you 're not going to rattle @entity8			0
' all smiles : @entity8 joked with reporters after stepping off the plane with his daughter @entity123 today ' have you seen my rope - a - dope ? ' @entity61 tried to damp down @entity3 's experience , telling @entity128 : ' i do n’t know how @entity3 will take on the debate			1
obviously the vice president has done 15 - 20 debates in his lifetime — he is an experienced debater — i think this is @entity3 ’s first debate			1
i may be wrong , he may have done something in high school , we do n’t know			0
' but , it will be a new experience for @entity3 , but i am sure he will do fine			0
frankly , he has policy , facts , and results on his side			0
so i think you find in the analysis people make the assessment on these debates not so much on the theatrics or smoothness of the presenter , but the policies and pathways being described			0
' popularity contest : a new @entity103 poll has found that voters view @entity8 less favourably than @entity3 charmer : @entity3 is widely seen as one of the most intellectually impressive of a new @entity73 generation in fact , according to @entity159 , @entity3 has taken part in at least eight debates during his 14 years in @entity83 - though none of them anything like as high - profile as thursday 's clash , which could be seen by as many as the 67 million who watched @entity61 and @entity6 in @entity115			1
according to @entity103 , @entity8 , whose role in the campaign is as attack dog and as the man who can connect with blue - collar voters , is viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters			0
four years ago , when he faced @entity105 , his favourability rating was 53 per cent			0
@entity61 has leapt to level pegging - or even into the lead - in national polls since his much - praised debate performance in @entity115			1
while @entity6 still holds slim leads in battleground states , his campaign badly needs to alter the trajectory of the race			0
@entity8 has the opportunity to do that but traditionally vice-presidential debate , while they have provided entertainment and some big moments , have not had an appreciable effect on the general election result			0
losing ground : @entity8 is viewed favourably by just 39 per cent of voters compared to four years ago , when he faced @entity105 and his favourability rating was 53 per cent in 1988 , senator @entity196 of @entity197 delivered one of the most famous put - downs in political history			2
when senator @entity201 , then vice-president @entity203 's running mate , said he had nearly as much congressional experience as @entity205 , @entity196 pounced			2
he said : ' senator , i served with @entity205 : i knew @entity205 ; @entity205 was a friend of mine			0
… senator , you 're no @entity205			0
' @entity201 responded lamely that this was ' really uncalled for ' and his political career arguably never recovered but in the november election , the @entity214 @entity73 ticket was victorious over governor @entity216 of @entity217 and @entity196 , the @entity85 ticket .			0

@entity3 says he expects @entity8 to come at him ' like a cannonball '
pressure on @entity8 to be aggressive after @entity6 flop in @entity115
he joked this morning about his strategy , saying ' you ever seen me rope - a - dope ? '
expectations are high that @entity73 vice presidential nominee @entity3 will win the debate against vice president @entity8
@entity8 , a senator for 36 years , is a far more experienced debater than @entity3 , who is 27 years younger than @entity8
@entity73 nominee @entity61 is *tamping* down expectations that @entity3 will win the debate to avoid *negative* fallout if his running mate fails to impress
