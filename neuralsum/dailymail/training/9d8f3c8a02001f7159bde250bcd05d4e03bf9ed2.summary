by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ riathalsam @entity2 have signed @entity4 ’s @entity3 on loan for the remainder of the season			1
the @entity9 under 21 midfielder will be available for saturday ’s @entity11 fixture against @entity12			1
@entity2 manager @entity13 was keen to strengthen his midfield options with knee injuries currently keeping out the vastly influential @entity16 , out for three - to - four weeks , as well as @entity17			1
loan star : @entity3 has joined @entity2 on a season - long loan from @entity4 the 22 - year - old has made 23 appearances for @entity4			1
he enjoyed his best spell under @entity24 , where he featured 14 times in the @entity11 , @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			0
last season , @entity3 featured in both legs of @entity4 ’ @entity27 victories over @entity33 before joining @entity34 on loan , making 26 appearances as the @entity38 club won the @entity40 play - off final			1
@entity2 manager @entity13 believes he has more quality to call on this season - but admits he does need extra bodies to bolster his squad			1
@entity44 drafted in @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 over the summer and on wednesday captured @entity51 defender @entity50 from @entity52 for a fee understood to be around the £ 8million mark			0
gaining experience : @entity3 spent last season on loan at @entity34 in the championship but @entity2 were also depleted as @entity58 and @entity59 left for @entity4 , loan signing @entity60 headed for @entity52 and the @entity63 quartet of @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 were among the other players who left			1
' it is different to last season			2
we had 25 - 26 senior professionals last season and now i have five or six of the @entity73 in my squad , ' @entity13 said ahead of newly - promoted @entity12 's trip to the @entity76 on saturday			1
' so in terms of that there is a big difference , but in terms of the players we can bring on , it is better			2
' there were players we have got rid of from last season and the players we have brought in i believe are better players			2
' that is how i feel , but in terms of numbers of senior professionals we do need two or three players			2
' we are in a very tough league that gets better every year and you have to add quality every year and get a group that is good together			0
' it has been a mammoth effort from everyone involved this summer to put these things in place on the budget we have , but at this moment we have worked it well			0
' @entity13 points to the signing of @entity50 as a symbol of the shrewd business @entity2 have done this summer , the 25 - year - old centre - half having been a @entity108 starter for @entity51 in @entity109 before injury struck			1
incoming : @entity2 completed the £ 8million signing of @entity50 during the week from @entity52 ' he is an @entity51 international , has played at a very high level with @entity52 and was highly considered over there , ' @entity13 said			1
' it 's important we try and improve the quality all the time and he fits our profile			0
' he is a good ball - playing centre - half , he is a good size and suits the way we play			0
hopefully he can adapt as quick as possible and offer us the quality he obviously possesses			0
' the @entity11 is an eye - opener for everyone , but you do n't play for the sides he has played for without being physical			0
' coming through in @entity51 is very physical , they are a tough people naturally and he should suit us well			0
' it 's now about getting him up to full fitness as he had an extended break after the @entity108 , more than some of our other players like @entity135 ( @entity136 ) and ( @entity138 ) @entity137 , as they reached the final			0
' @entity2 shocked @entity140 on the opening day of the season to win a league match at @entity144 for the first time in their history			1
sign when you 're winning : @entity2 boss @entity13 still wants to add players to his squad despite @entity45 's ( above ) strike helping the @entity151 to a 2 - 1 win at @entity140 on the opening day since then @entity44 has spent the week telling his players not to underestimate @entity12 opponents who lost their opening game 3 - 1 at home to @entity158			1
' there is a concern which is why i 've stressed to them , i 'm conscious we know how important it is to follow up , ' @entity13 said			2
' there 's no guarantees but if we can get preparations as best as possible it gives you a chance of delivering a performance you 're happy with and can win a game			0
' @entity12 will be a hard working team			2
they are together , work for each other and can be a threat			0
' i watched the @entity158 game , they started well and got their goal but this is the difference at this level when you come up against players of their standards			0
' there is always a chance they can turn it on and play their best which they did , but i thought @entity12 did very well			2
