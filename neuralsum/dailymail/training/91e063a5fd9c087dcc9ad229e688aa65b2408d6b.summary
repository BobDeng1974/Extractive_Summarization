' the @entity18 database is saved on the sd card which can be read by any @entity2 application if the user allows it to access the sd card			1
' and since majority of the people allows everything on their @entity2 device , this is not much of a problem , ' @entity24 wrote on his blog			0
he outlined the steps needed - and even provided the code to do it			0

' next thing we need is an @entity2 application which uploads the @entity18 database to the website			2
