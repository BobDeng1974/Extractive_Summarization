@entity16 has refused to release a full list of guests at the prime minister 's @entity6 retreat			2
it claims there is no commitment to transparency where the bill for meals , drinks and hospitality was picked up by the @entity30 party			0
mr @entity3 's official spokesman said : ' there are distinctions that are drawn with government business and party political business			1
i don ; t think there is anything new in that			0
' but he refused to say how many people had secretly visited @entity6 or how much the conservative party paid for entertaining supporters at the taxpayer - funded property			2
the spokesman added : ' the approach is the one that has been taken forward for a very considerable time going back to before 2010			0
' he insisted that despite the refusal to release the full @entity6 guest list , the government is ' more government information than ever before '			1
mr @entity3 faced claims of a ‘ @entity6 cover - up ’ last night after the government failed to publish a full list of visitors to his grace - and - favour country residence			1
@entity16 was accused of exploiting a loophole which means visitors to @entity6 funded by the @entity30 , or the prime minister personally , are kept secret			2
the latest annual @entity6 guest list was finally published more than a year late on friday evening , with no warning			1
it reveals that mr @entity3 entertained the emir of @entity68 and the provost of @entity70 , his old school , but is largely dominated by an uncontroversial string of conservative and @entity74 ministers			1
the last @entity6 guest list included @entity78 ’s @entity77 , now on trial over phone hacking and other alleged offences , and @entity30 donor and treasurer @entity82			1
in 2012 , mr @entity3 was forced to admit seeing at least 15 @entity30 donors , who have handed the party £ 23million , in a series of secret lunches and dinners at @entity16 and @entity6			1
@entity93 , then @entity30 treasurer and one of those who enjoyed hospitality , said in late 2009 that he expected a @entity30 government to axe the 50p rate , which it did on taking office			0
a list of guests to @entity99 , @entity100 ’s official residence , was also published on friday evening			1
it contains politicians , journalists and tv personalities , including @entity105 and @entity106			0
critics said it appeared the @entity30 was seeking to avoid scrutiny of sensitive friends and supporters ’ visits to @entity6 , near @entity112 in @entity113 , by paying for their hospitality			2
no details of how much was paid , or how charges were calculated , were available			0
@entity117 , the shadow minister for the @entity118 , has written to mr @entity3 demanding full publication			1
‘ there are some glaring omissions from the list , ’ he wrote			0
‘ @entity6 is a public building and being able to access it is a privilege			2
the fact that the @entity30 may have nominally paid to host various people at @entity6 can not be used as a device to block transparency in relation to lobbyists and others gaining access			2
’ mr @entity117 said it appeared that there was an ‘ attempt to buy out of transparency , which leaves the perception of a @entity6 cover - up ’			2
he added : ‘ regrettably – given you once said “ sunlight is the best disinfectant ” – your previous commitments to openness have not been met			0
‘ it is now vital that a full and complete list of all visitors to @entity6 and @entity16 , whether paid for by the prime minister or by the @entity30 , is published			1
’ a general view of @entity6 , the prime minister 's official country residence , in @entity113 @entity151 , the @entity152 mp for @entity153 , said releasing the list quietly on a friday night ‘ smacks of burying bad news ’			1
he said : ‘ you would only do this if you ’ve got something that you would be embarrassed about			0
’ a @entity16 spokesman said : ‘ this return includes guests who have received official hospitality at @entity6 , excluding officials and special advisers			0
‘ consistent with the practice of previous administrations , it does not include those receiving hospitality paid for personally by the prime minister or by the @entity30			0
’ the @entity171 accused @entity152 of ‘ hypocrisy ’ because @entity173 promised to give regular updates on meetings with trade unionists and donors , yet this has not happened since march 2012			0
a @entity30 spokesman said the party had published a list of the prime minister ’s meetings with donors – including at @entity6 – quarterly since 2012			1
a @entity30 source said : ‘ we ’ve published expenses over £ 500 online and details of ministerial meetings			0
this is grade a hypocrisy			0
