by @entity0 published : 17:36 est , 15 june 2013 updated : 11:17 est , 19 june 2013 a group of daring archaeologists uncovered a lost 1,200 - year - old city on a misty @entity6 mountain by hacking through the thick jungle , strewn with live land mines			1
yet they were also aided in their quest by some incredible technology that revealed the ancient city to them in the first place , and guided by a local - a one - legged former @entity17 soldier			1
@entity20 , the city they found , is thought to pre-date the famous site of @entity22 by around 350 years and lies only 25 miles west of that huge temple			1
archaeologists believe @entity20 was the first city of the @entity26 in 802 ad			1
the technology was developed in the early 1960s and uses laser imaging with radar technology that can calculate distances			1
it was first used in meteorology to measure clouds by the @entity55			0
the term lidar is a portmanteau of ' light and ' radar			0
' lidar uses ultraviolet , visible , or near infrared light to image objects and can be used with a wide range of targets , including non-metallic objects , rocks , rain , chemical compounds , aerosols , clouds and even single molecules			0
a narrow laser beam can be used to map physical features with very high resolution			2
the @entity76 reported the expedition exclusively , which began in earnest after the team used lidar technology on a helicopter			1
the lidar system uses pulsing laser signals to see through the thick undergrowth , where it detected a distinct outline of the the long - forgotten city			2
it uses ultraviolet , visible , or near infrared light to image objects and can be used with a wide range of targets , including non-metallic objects , rocks , rain , chemical compounds , aerosols , clouds and even single molecules			0
this map of northwest @entity6 gives an overview of the areas where @entity30 and his team used the lidar imagery technology			2
the relevant areas covered are shaded yellow perilous : the team were guided by @entity107 ( left ) a local , one - legged , former @entity17 soldier through the dangerous jungle @entity30 , director of the @entity32 's archaeological research center in @entity6 , told the @entity76 of his ' eureka ' moment when the city appeared on his screen			2
' with this instrument - bang - all of a sudden we saw an immediate picture of an entire city that no one knew existed which is just remarkable , ' @entity30 said			2
so his team headed into the perilous mountain countryside of @entity6 , along goat tracks , through deep bogs and around rivers , always avoiding the live land mines placed during previous conflicts			0
location : @entity20 lies in the @entity129 mountain range in @entity130 of @entity6 they were helped in this by @entity107 , a chain - smoking former @entity17 soldier who lost a leg in mine explosion			0
even the local was surprised by what the archaeologists took him to			2
the team discovered a whole urban landscape with canals , roads , caves and , as yet unexplained , mounds which could be tombs			0
@entity30 added that : ' there may be implications for society today ... for example , we see from the imagery that the landscape was completely devoid of vegetation			0
' the archaeologist had one explanation for this : ' one theory we are looking at is that the severe environmental impact of deforestation and the dependence on water management led to the demise of the civilisation â€¦ perhaps it became too successful to the point of becoming unmanageable			0
' ancestor : the new - found city predates the famous @entity22 temple by 350 years the archaeologists were astounded by what they found lidar imagery shows the central area of @entity22			1
the ' walled city ' of @entity173 is pictured above @entity22			1
the red lines are features such as roads and canals from the post-medieval period , while the other features are from the @entity22 era a pre-publication draft from the @entity182 claimed that @entity20 , as well as @entity22 , would have been part of a ' vast urban network			1
' the paper said : ' we identify an entire , previously undocumented , formally planned urban landscape into which the major temples such as @entity22 were integrated			1
' beyond these newly identified urban landscapes , the @entity191 data reveal anthropogenic changes to the landscape on a vast scale , and lend further weight to an emerging consensus that infrastructural complexity , unsustainable modes of subsistence and climate variation were crucial factors in the decline of the classical @entity205 civilization			1
' according to @entity207 , the researchers claim the new map shows a pattern of ' city blocks '			0
mounds and ponds would have been built within these blocks to create temple precincts			0
they type of ' cityscapes ' were seen in ancient @entity22 as well as the @entity129 region and another area farther northeast , known as @entity219			1
the researchers added : ' these ' urban temples ' are not isolated ; rather , they are nodes in an increasingly concentrated medieval cityscape			0

archaeologists used @entity191 technology that combines narrow lasers with radars to scan the ancient city
it was *attached* to a helicopter that *spent* a week *flying* over the site north of @entity22 *collecting* the data
