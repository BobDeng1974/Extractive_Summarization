by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 18:37 est , 26 april 2013 updated : 20:02 est , 26 april 2013 @entity2 yesterday warned that the furore over false intelligence about @entity6 ’s weapons of mass destruction was stopping @entity8 leaders getting tough with @entity9			1
after accusing @entity9 ’s @entity10 of war crimes by using the chemical weapon sarin , he admitted the @entity14 blunders made by @entity16 ’s government offered an excuse for leaders to do nothing			1
mr @entity2 said : ‘ i do worry about that			0
i think the @entity6 lesson must be about how we marshal and use information and intelligence and i think that lesson has been learned			2
crisis : as the @entity9 civil war rages on , this week the @entity28 administration announced that as well as conventional weapons , president @entity10 has used chemical weapons on civilians recent interview : president @entity10 accused the @entity34 on wednesday of backing @entity35 in his country 's civil war this week ‘ but i think it is very important for politicians and leaders of this generation to look at what is happening in @entity9 and ask ourselves what more we can do			1
’ earlier mr @entity2 ramped up the rhetoric against @entity10 over the alleged use of sarin			2
‘ it is extremely serious , this is a war crime , and we should take it very seriously , ’ he said			0
he echoed @entity28 by warning ‘ this should form for the international community a red line for us to do more ’			1
that is code for military intervention by the @entity34			0
his statements make @entity60 and @entity61 air strikes far more likely and officials admit that imposing a ‘ no - fly zone ’ over @entity9 is definitely ‘ on the table ’ for top - level discussion			1
however , mr @entity2 ruled out sending @entity60 troops into @entity9 saying : ‘ do i think putting troops on the ground in @entity9 is the right thing to do , as we did in @entity6 and @entity70 ? no , i do n’t			1
should we be working with our allies , the @entity72 , @entity61 , others in the @entity74 to support the responsible part of the opposition , do everything we can ? to train them , to work with them so they can support their people , to put pressure on the regime ? yes , we should			0
’ criticism : @entity2 , right , openly said that the misuse of intelligence under @entity16 , left , was discouraging leaders from acting over the @entity9 civil war mr @entity2 is expected to lead a @entity87 meeting and talk to mr @entity28 next week			1
national security adviser sir @entity88 held video conferences this week with his @entity61 opposite number @entity91			0
meanwhile , @entity93 scientists at the @entity94 at @entity95 , @entity96 , have analysed samples smuggled out of @entity9 and confirmed they are @entity99 samples probably include ones from the @entity9 government ’s attack on april 13 near the city of @entity104			0
@entity106 officers are also working with the @entity107 to gather intelligence on the exact circumstances in which chemical weapons were used			1
dilemma : president @entity28 faces a hard decision over the ongoing situation in @entity9 as he said that use of chemical weapons by @entity10 was the ' red line ' @entity60 diplomats want to present concrete evidence to the @entity118 that chemical weapons were used			1
they need to secure support from @entity120 for international intervention			0
@entity122 has so far blocked @entity118 action			0
asked if air strikes and a no - fly zone are under consideration , a senior government source said : ‘ nothing is off the table			0
these are issues that we will be exploring with our allies			0
the priority is to obtain the full facts			0
' the @entity120 have previously taken the same view as us on the use of chemical weapons so there may be an opportunity to get some movement at the @entity118			1
but before we make that case we need the full facts			0
’ it is feared that @entity9 ’s large arsenal of chemical weapons , approximately 1,000 tons , stored in 50 towns and cities , could fall into the hands of @entity35			2
@entity61 special forces are understood to have devised plans to seize control of the arsenal , but sources here denied @entity60 will help them			2
despite the mounting evidence @entity9 continues to deny using chemical weapons			2
@entity9 official @entity156 called the @entity61 claims ‘ lies ’ and likened them to false accusations that @entity6 possessed weapons of mass destruction ahead of the @entity61 - led invasion .			1

@entity16 's false alarm over @entity6 has stopped leaders *tackling* @entity10 says *pm*
@entity60 and the @entity61 have accused @entity10 of using chemical weapon sarin
@entity28 warned the chemical weapons should be ' a red line ' for intervention
