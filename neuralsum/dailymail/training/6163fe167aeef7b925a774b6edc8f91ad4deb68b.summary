@entity0 admits the heat is already on at @entity2 after starting the new campaign with a home defeat			1
it was n’t simply the pain of losing to neighbours @entity7 but also the experience that a flying start can set the tone for the months ahead , while an early setback is only likely to increase anxiety levels			1
asked when he expected to start feeling the pressure , he guffawed and replied : ' tomorrow '			1
' the start is everything , ' he admitted			2
' it is a trigger to the whole season and whereabouts you are going to finish			2
' the perfect example is our first two seasons back in the @entity24 where we acquired 14 points in the first eight games in the first [ season ] and only eight in the first eight last season			1
' we saw that last season was a struggle			2
in the end we finished six points behind the season before			0
' we had a huge amount of problems and lot of criticism for results and that comes by allowing yourself to slip into the bottom or relegation zone			0
that is where the pressure really mounts on you			2
' our life is about results , not how well you play or compete			0
the game is about winning and we have not won so people will be disappointed			0
exasperated : @entity0 protests against the award of a @entity7 free - kick off target : @entity70 slides his penalty wide as @entity2 wasted a golden chance to take the lead dismissed : @entity74 was sent off by referee @entity75 for handball after conceding the penalty 10 men : @entity79 collected a second booking for @entity2 later in the match ' they ’ll not be any more disappointed than me or the players in the dressing room			1
they ’re all downhearted , as we lost and the way that we lost			0
deep down inside they know what a big three points we have let slip ; a big - big three points , against our local and biggest rivals			2
' @entity0 must ensure @entity2 respond in another @entity96 derby , against @entity97 on saturday			1
he has not given up hope of adding to the squad and hopes more players are closer to full fitness by then , including new signing @entity102 , who came off the bench against @entity7			1
' when everyone is fit , our squad runs at the same level as most teams around our level , ' he added , and he was heartened by much of what he saw in saturday ’s 1 - 0 defeat and felt his team would have won had @entity115 not missed the penalty awarded as @entity7 went down to 10 men			1
debutant : new signing @entity102 came off the bench for the @entity2 ' i do n’t think there is much doubt about that , ' said @entity0			1
' but i would want the players to forgive @entity70 for missing a penalty for the first time and not put it on him as a heavy burden as he does not deserve it			0
his penalty taking in the three years that i have been here has been absolutely superb			0
' we have to forgive him for missing the odd one and the rest of the lads should have made up for that			0
when they came in at the end they should ’ve been smacking him on the back of the head saying do n’t worry about it we ’ve got you out of jail			0
that ’s what we should have done			0
