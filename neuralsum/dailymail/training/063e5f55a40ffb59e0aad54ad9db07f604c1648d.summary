' thinking up other odd jobs came from research , word - of - mouth and luck			2
as it was a personal project not funded by anyone else i tracked down odd jobs all over the @entity66 staying with friends and grouping odd jobs in cities together			1

an artificial inseminator gets stuck into a routine task tampon tester : judging by his beaming smile this fellow is definitely the right man for the job team player : this wax museum figure maker fits in around the office just fine a coin polisher sifts through hundreds of silver coins a immaculately coiffured dog handler with and equally well - turned out poodle a fish counter keeps a close eye on her charges as they swim on by a dowser 's job is to detect groundwater using a divining rod although may scientists say it 's purely down to chance @entity15 has huddled underneath a trailer as hundreds of cows were artificially inseminated by a more - than - willing man and watched as a museum worker painstakingly dusted dinosaur bones			1

but in 1989 , after spotting a race - timer at the @entity175 in @entity176 , miss @entity15 became fascinated with those who leave their house every morning to thrust themselves into the most unconventional working scenarios			1
after three years of travelling and research since the inception of her idea , she had amassed 15 photographs , which she bundled into a drawer			1
@entity186 for heights : her adventures saw her scaling @entity189 to follow a @entity191 crack - filler , as he perilously dangled over the rock face , making sure that time did n't take its toll on four of @entity66 's most famous sculpted faces @entity197 collector : one of the more unusual jobs was when she photographed a woman who collects bull 's semen for a living a horse dentist gets to grip with a rather tricky - looking patient a fish doctor struggles to keep hold of a poorly carp as it wriggles around his net the bizarre shots sat dormant for nearly five years before somebody expressed an interest and the idea for a book became a reality			1
there have now been two volumes of her images - @entity133 , released in 2002 , and 2006 ’s follow - up @entity220			0
she describes her motivation for taking the pictures as a ‘ fascination with @entity66 humour ’ , which shines through in many of her photographs			1

@entity241 : a woman 's day job is standing as still as a statue in @entity16 sparring partner : her unusual subjects could not be further removed from her own working life as a young portrait photographer , capturing household names such as @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 despite spending a large part of her working life meeting people because of the strange ways they earned a living , miss @entity15 says she was struck by the ‘ normality ’ of those she met			1
while some may expect an occupation as an animal keeper at the @entity261 mansion to go hand - in - hand with unorthodoxy , miss @entity15 says : i was struck by how they were all quite normal – and all the people i met seemed to enjoy their jobs			1
’ she adds : ‘ some of them even invented their own jobs – such as the sandcastle instructor – which i found quite charming ’			0

clock master : making sure that this clock never loses time is this man 's job golf ball diver : she describes her motivation for taking the pictures as a ' fascination with @entity66 humour ' , which shines through in many of her photographs whether dealing with notable figures such as literary giant @entity296 , or the owner of a pet cemetery , she said she was always equally inspired – driven by the lure of turning up on a job and ‘ not knowing what to expect ’			1
describing how she picked suitable subjects for her odd jobs , she says : ‘ my criteria for odd was simple : there had to be a twist of some sort			0
‘ perhaps there was a gender reversal for example , a male bra designer or a young man testing tampons			0
‘ in fact , ‘ testing ’ professions became a whole chapter			0
or perhaps the job dealt with death or a forbidden but funny subject — or maybe the job was performed by only one person on earth			0
’ her stylised shots , carrying an otherworldliness befitting her subjects , were always taken in black and white , which she describes as the ‘ colours of photography ’			0
