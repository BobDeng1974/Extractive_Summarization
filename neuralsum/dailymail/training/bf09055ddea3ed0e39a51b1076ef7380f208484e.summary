@entity1 , from @entity2 , was found unresponsive in his parents ' double bed after all three slept there together , an inquest heard a healthy baby boy may have been accidentally smothered as he and his parents all slept together in a double bed , an inquest was told			1
@entity1 , who was seven weeks old , had been taken from his moses basket into his parents ' bed for an early morning feed less than two hours before he was found lying , unresponsive , next to his mother			1
the baby , who was discovered by his father as he got up for work , was n't breathing , and had blood trickling from his nose , and was declared dead by doctors soon after when efforts to resuscitate him failed , the hearing in @entity2 , @entity16 , was told			1
@entity24 , a thriving baby boy from @entity2 , had been put to bed the night before in his moses basket next to his parents ' bed , and woke at 1am for a feed and again at 4.20am			1
a police statement read to the court said the baby 's mother , @entity30 , 29 , woke her partner up to prepare the feed at 4.20am before feeding her small son herself			2
@entity24 's father last saw miss @entity30 holding @entity24 as he went back to sleep , before his alarm woke him up at 6am			2
mr @entity1 had been sleeping on the far side of the bed next to a wardrobe , miss @entity30 was in the middle , and the baby on the side of the bed between his mother and his moses basket , the coroner was told			1
the baby 's father noticed his son lying unresponsive on his back , with his feet under the duvet , beside his mother			1
@entity24 was n't breathing and had blood trickling from his nose			1
mr @entity1 dialled 999 and began to administer @entity55 , but the baby was pronounced dead at @entity2 hospital at 6.49am that day			1
miss @entity30 's aunt , @entity58 , 55 , who also lived at the house , told the inquest @entity24 was a healthy baby			2
' @entity24 was a thriving baby who woke up at regular times like clockwork , ' she said			0
' he was doing really well , no illness , no coughs , no nothing - he was coming on well			0
' she said she had made her home smoke - free before the baby was born , and insisted on @entity24 's parents , both of whom smoked , doing so outdoors			2
and mrs @entity58 said the room was kept to an optimal temperature which the baby 's father was ' meticulous ' about checking , which ruled out the possibility of the baby overheating			0
police said they had spoken to the baby 's parents about the incident but had not taken any action against them			0
@entity24 , pictured with his parents @entity86 , 29 , and @entity30 , 29 , was an otherwise healthy little boy paediatric pathologist @entity89 told the inquest that tests had found nothing wrong with @entity24 , and said that in the past , the baby 's death would have been attributed to ' cot death '			1
she said the term ' unascertained death ' was used more now , but said certain factors including sleeping not in a cot and sleeping with a parent were known to be linked to a higher incidence of such deaths			2
recording an open verdict , coroner @entity103 said that the infant may have been a victim of ' accidental overlaying ' , where the child is smothered by a larger individual sleeping on top of them			1
he told the family that because an adult turns in the night , one could obstruct a baby 's airways and the baby would not have the ability to push back			0
mr @entity103 said : ' i recognise that one possibility is that of accidentally overlaying			0
i can not eliminate that as a possibility , but certainly no evidence that would confirm that			0
' whilst it might be a natural cause of death , nothing can confirm that , and in these circumstances it therefore leaves me with no alternative than to reach an open verdict			0
' the coroner added : ' i know you wanted an explanation ; that i have been unable to give you			0
' there is nothing i can say that will go close to reflecting the tragedy of this situation other than you have my heartfelt condolences			0
