the stunned pair were within touching distance of the sea monster as they enjoyed the summer sun just off shore at @entity6 in @entity7 on thursday afternoon			1
the basking shark ’s massive dorsal fin can be seen protruding around two feet from the water and dwarfs the kayaks bobbing beside it			1
but this curious leviathan of the deep was less interested in the boaters as food and was more likely searching for its favourite dish , a hearty helping of plankton			1
need a bigger kayak : two kayakers cling to each other 's canoe as a giant 20 - foot shark cruises past just inches from them fortunately although basking sharks are the second biggest fish in the sea they are plankton eaters and harmless to humans			1
photographer @entity42 caught the astonishing scene and was astonished by the shark ’s size			2
' it was gigantic , ' she said			2
' there were four of them and that was the biggest			2
sea monster : the basking shark 's massive dorsal fin can be seen protruding around two feet from the water and is nearly as broad as the kayaks the pair are sitting on mesmerising : members of the public watch in awe as a giant 20 - foot long basking shark glides past at @entity6 in @entity7 ' they were feeding not far from shore			1
' there were a few kayakers nearby and the shark just passed them and did n’t seem bothered at all			2
' the size of the fin gives a feel for the size of the shark - it was quite a sight			0
' unfortunatley a snorkel diver went in to have a closer look at the shark and it just swam away			0
' the real jaws : fortunately although basking sharks are the second biggest fish in the sea they are plankton eaters and harmless to humans big fish : they can reach up to 36ft and weigh up to seven tons			1
they are the largest wild animal to regularly visit @entity85 reaching lengths of up to 36ft , basking sharks are the largest fish in @entity85 waters			0
one of only three plankton - feeding shark species , these harmless giants reappear in @entity85 coastal waters each summer			1
their presence is often marked by their large dorsal fin , though watchers are often lucky enough to see baskers breach - jumping clear of the water			0
the basking shark is the second largest of shark species , second only to the also ' vegetarian ' whale shark			0
the basking shark is so - called because it is most often observed when feeding at the surface , appearing to be basking in the warmer water			0
it does n't suck up its food by pumping water through its gills - as the whale shark or the wonderfully named megamouth shark			0
instead , it relies only on water being pushed through its gills by swimming .			0
