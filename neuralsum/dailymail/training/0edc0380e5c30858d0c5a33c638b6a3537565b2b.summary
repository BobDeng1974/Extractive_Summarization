neither of the two leaders provided details about when the @entity37 could join the aerial campaign			2
@entity39 added that @entity37 has delivered four arms shipments and 60 metric tons ( 66 tons ) of humanitarian equipment to @entity1			2

@entity95 spokesman @entity232 said the new total reflects stronger recruitment by the extremists since june , following battlefield successes and the group 's declaration of an @entity177 state , or caliphate , on territory under its control			0
i have a plan : both @entity99 and @entity100 in @entity101 lined up yesterday behind @entity103 's call to combat the militants , a day after he laid out a long - term campaign to defeat is mediation : the @entity19 has been asked to act not just as a ' leader for its friends and allies ' , but also as a ' referee between @entity60 , @entity73 and @entity252 ' when dealing with @entity1 and @entity34 ( pictured : @entity60 king abdullah bin @entity251 and @entity67 talk before the meeting only @entity73 would not back the plans against @entity15 , after it was asked to secure its borders to prevent oil smuggling out of @entity1 and @entity34 and keep foreign fighters from heading in			1

squabbling among @entity285 's allies in the region has complicated efforts to present a united front to beat back the militants			0
@entity60 , the @entity290 and @entity61 are at odds with @entity292 and @entity73 because of the latter two countries ' support for the @entity295 and other @entity297 groups in the region			0
@entity61 's foreign minister , @entity298 , emphasized that rift in his opening remarks , saying regional chaos is the result of a number of factors , including the tolerance of some in the region and the @entity308 for ' so - called political islam ' - a clear dig at supporters of the @entity295			0
