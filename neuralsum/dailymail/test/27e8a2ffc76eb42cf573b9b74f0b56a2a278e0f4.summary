@entity1 manager @entity0 has claimed no club has made an offer for @entity4 , and that the left back would be better off continuing his development at @entity1 amid rumoured interest from @entity8 and @entity9			1
@entity4 , 25 , has been a consistent performer for the @entity1 since signing from @entity10 for £ 2million last summer , making 32 @entity12 appearances and scoring twice in his debut top - flight season			1
the defender ’s performances have not gone un-noticed among the division ’s top sides , with @entity8 and @entity9 supposedly eyeing a deal for @entity19 in the summer			1
but @entity20 claims that club have not been approached with an offer for his services			0
@entity1 defender @entity4 ( right ) is a reported target for @entity8 and @entity9 the 25 - year - old has starred for the @entity1 this term , scoring twice - including this goal against @entity28 ‘ as far as i am concerned , no - one has bid for @entity4			1
so , it ’s all pure rumours and speculation , which has to fill the huge amount of media space that you have to fill , ’ @entity0 said			2
‘ my problem is : does it affect @entity4 and affect his performance ? ‘ players can lose that focus on that rumour and that ’s for me to make sure @entity4 does what he can all season and he performs on a consistent basis			2
what will happen in the summer , we will wait and see			0
‘ i have even heard somebody said we have put a £ 25m buyout on him			0
that ’s the first i know , i have n’t heard anything from myself or through owners to say “ well , if somebody wants @entity52 they would have to pay 25m			0
” ’ despite @entity4 ’s smooth negotiation of the step up to the @entity12 from the @entity55 , @entity0 firmly believes he would be better served staying with the east @entity58 side next season			1
@entity59 boss @entity0 ( centre ) believes @entity4 would be better off staying to develop his game ‘ there ’s no doubt about that , because he ’s year one in the @entity12			1
year one is an ongoing experience that you have that you know the level , ’ @entity0 continued			2
‘ @entity4 now needs to grow from that experience			2
his challenge is to continue to work as harder than he has this year , not to rest on his laurels , to think that he ’s here			0
‘ we have seen players do that and then year two more of a disaster than his impressive first year			0
his professionalism will come into play start of next year by where he gets and if he gets to the next level .			0
