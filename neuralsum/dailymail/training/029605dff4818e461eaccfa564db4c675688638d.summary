the mites are too small to be seen with the naked eye and signs of infection include intense itching and a red rash			2
treatment is simple and essential			2
permethrin cream or malathion lotion must be applied to the affected areas			2
everyone in a household – as well as any sexual partners – must also be treated			2
@entity50 is usually contracted in highly unhygienic environments			1
once the minuscule mites have laid their dozens of eggs , there is a two - to six - week incubation period , after which lesions appear on the victim ’s arms , hands , torso and genitalia			2

@entity1 sources told @entity140 that when the outbreak was identified , the regiment ’s medical staff advised that all military training involving bodily contact should cease until the scabies was eradicated			1
despite that , many guardsmen then took part in exercises at a training centre at @entity152 in @entity153 , after which the outbreak continued			0
last night , the @entity41 said that accommodation used by the guardsmen at @entity152 was now being deep - cleaned			0
