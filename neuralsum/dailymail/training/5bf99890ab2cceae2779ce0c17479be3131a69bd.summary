i was filling the camper van with petrol at 3.30am in @entity3 , @entity4 , and could n't help but notice the large man with an out - of - control orange beard walking towards me			1
' could you tell me when @entity9 's passing this way ? ' he asked			2
the @entity9 in question was @entity12 , who , with her brother @entity13 were members of an eight - person team participating in the 2014 @entity16 ( @entity16 ) cycle race			1
wide open spaces : @entity19 - with landmarks such as the @entity21 - is a wonderful country for cycling i was a member of a team in the same event , so i had the answer - but not the one he was looking for			1
he 'd missed her : @entity9 and her crew were slightly quicker than us , and a few hours ahead			0
the news disappointed my bearded friend			0
@entity16 is regarded as one of the toughest cycle races in the world , with competitors starting on the @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38 , and finishing 3,020 miles and a total of 170,000ft of climbing later in @entity40 , @entity41 , on the @entity42			1
once the clock starts , it does n't stop until the team cross the finishing line			0
for solo riders , this means an average of 90 minutes ' sleep every 24 hours during the seven to 11 days they are on the road			1
girl on a mission : @entity12 took part in the 2014 @entity16 ( left ) ; in her usual glamourous mode ( right ) when i say i was part of a team , i must confess that i was n't actually taking part			1
i was a member of the 13 - strong back - up crew required to make sure our four riders , all raising money for @entity63 , travelled across the @entity19 as quickly and safely as possible , and we did it in seven days , nine hours and 42 minutes			1
the race is in its 34th year and attracts somewhere in the region of 350 riders and more than 1,000 support crew who handle all the logistics - including food , fluids , navigation , laundry , medical needs and bike repairs , so that all the riders have to do is race			1
it was a major life experience for all our riders			1
none had experienced sleep deprivation on this scale			0
crew tended to get a couple of hours ' sleep every 14 hours or so , with riders slightly more			1
for the first 24 hours everyone runs on adrenaline , the next 24 are tough but bearable , but by day three you can see only what other crew members are n't doing and fail to recognise anything they actually do			0
it was on the third day of the event that we actually saw crew members from another team wrestling each other by the side of the road			1
and we heard of another team who 'd been forced to hire an additional back - up vehicle as two of their crew could no longer share the same space			1
however , after day three the body becomes more used to the lack of sleep and some form of ' status quo ' returns			0
although there were more dark moments along the way , i can no longer recall them and it 's the highlights that will live with me for ever			0
an a-list attraction : passing through @entity125 ( in @entity4 and @entity126 ) was one of @entity129 's highlights from a scenic point of view , the route is stunning			0
a few personal recollections in chronological order : * the 4,000ft descent from the @entity137 mountains via ' @entity138 ' - the road into the @entity140 , 170ft below sea level with temperatures in excess of @entity144			1
* the stunning @entity125 , characterised by clusters of vast iconic red sandstone buttes			0
* riding at 10,000ft over the snow - capped @entity148			1
* the arrow - straight roads disappearing into the horizon across the @entity152 of @entity153			1
* the @entity154 and the beautiful , densely wooded @entity155			0
* the famous @entity157 battlefield at @entity158 in @entity159			0
we arrived at the @entity161 in @entity40 shattered but with the most amazing sense of achievement , and a bond between a group of individuals that will last for ever			0
the logistics of getting a team of four cyclists non-stop to the end of a 3,000 - mile race are complicated			1
as a crew , we planned for several months prior to the race while the riders trained			1
we decided to operate two crews and work in seven - hour shifts			2
each shift would see two riders alternating on the road , usually doing a half - hour stint each before swapping			1
at the end of seven hours , they 'd be replaced by the two riders who had been resting			2
on the road behind each pair of riders there was a driver , a navigator and a nutritionist , who ensured that the riders were topped up with fluids and food			2
just another 2,000 - ish miles ago : a member of @entity129 's team keeps the pedals turning across @entity19 in the @entity140 , one of our riders consumed more than six litres of fluid during his seven - hour shift and still managed to lose some 4lb in weight			1
supporting these people were the guys and girls in the motorhome , who made sure that a hearty meal was prepared for the riders coming on to shift and something even more substantial for those coming off			2
they also took care of laundry , food shopping , the constant supply of ice , blogging , updating our website , and any other unforeseen requirements thrown at them			0
the motorhome was also the communications hub , which presented its own set of challenges when no signal of any form could be detected for many miles in the more remote areas along our route			0
one of the ' unforeseens ' came when we discovered that a couple of our riders and crew could n't sleep in a moving vehicle			2
to solve this problem we 'd anticipate where a shift would end and try to book a motel room there			0
the resting riders would be driven about 120 miles along the route and deposited in the room			2
the incoming riders would jump into the ' still warm ' beds and rest before themselves being transported a further 120 miles to the next change of shift			2
as a crew member , i got to meet a few locals as i travelled from west to east			1
apparently more than half of @entity19 have never travelled outside the @entity19 , almost two - thirds do not even own a passport and more than a few have never been outside their own state			2
so when you mention you 're part of a team cycling across @entity19 , they 're stunned and impressed in equal measure			1
@entity256 : @entity129 's route took him over the wide water of the @entity259 ( pictured here in @entity261 ) i 'm not suggesting the following encounter is typical , but it certainly made an impression on me … halfwaythrough the race we were having some difficulties with a faulty generator on our motorhome			2
so one of our crew wandered over to a giant truck , explained our problem to the driver and asked if he could possibly help			0
after a moment , the driver looked down and said : ' i do n't know nothing about generators			0
' he then paused for several seconds before continuing : ' but i know a whole lot about chickens			0
' fortunately , we had n't experienced any problems with chickens , so his expertise in this area was n't required			0
a few of our crew and cyclists were so moved by the overall @entity16 experience they are planning a ' race within a race ' next year			1
as 2015 sees the @entity290 taking place , they approached numerous former international rugby players from around the world and invited them to participate			0
many have responded saying they 're keen			0
it seems cycling is the preferred method of keeping fit for retired players with ' dodgy knees ' ( they have no idea what they 're letting themselves in for ! )			2
if you fancy taking part in such an experience , ask yourself the following questions : do i have a sense of adventure ? can i function on very little sleep ? do i have a modicum of common sense ? am i willing to commit to a seriously tough challenge ? if the answer to all of these is yes , take a look at the @entity16 website - www.raceacrossamerica.org			1
who knows , you might be inspired to get a team together and enter the challenge			0
our team covered all our costs ( excluding flights , which were paid by each individual ) through corporate sponsorship and in addition raised more than £ 50,000 for asthma @entity63			0
a landmark on the way forward : @entity129 was also entranced by the @entity332 in @entity159 we never did catch up with @entity9 's team , who were riding for another charity , the @entity336 , which campaigns for education for all			2
they finished almost a full day ahead of us			0
i know how incredibly hard our cyclists worked , so hats off to @entity9 's team			0
she may have a famous sister and a ' party girl ' reputation , but on this occasion she definitely walked the walk ... or , more accurately , cycled the cycle , all the way across @entity19 .			1

the @entity16 is a cycle event that crosses the whole country
riders race non-stop from west - coast @entity38 to east - coast @entity41
