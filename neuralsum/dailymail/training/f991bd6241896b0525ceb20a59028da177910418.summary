snuggling up with a good book in bed has long been seen as a way to wind down at the end of the day			2
but scientists have discovered that the millions who read their bedtime stories on an @entity8 or a @entity9 are actually keeping themselves awake			2
they found that people who regularly read electronic books before lights out sleep for fewer hours			1
people who read on @entity8 and @entity14 before bed are less sleepy and take longer to fall asleep this is because the blue glow emitted by the electronic devices can destroy the body ’s natural rhythm			1
all living things have an internal mechanism – known as the circadian rhythm , or body clock – which synchronises bodily functions to the 24 - hour pattern of the @entity28 ’s rotation			2
the clock is regulated by the senses , most importantly , the way the eye perceives light and dark			0
this mechanism rules our daily rhythms , including sleep and waking patterns and metabolism			0
it also determines whether we are a ‘ morning ’ or an ‘ evening ’ person			0
but the pressures of modern living mean many of us now increasingly work against our body clocks – with disrupted sleep thought to be partly responsible for increased rates of cancer , dementia and diabetes			2
during the two - week study , 12 participants read electronic books for four hours before bedtime			1
the experiment was then repeated with printed books			0
the researchers found that those reading on screens were less sleepy in the evening and took longer to fall asleep			0
they had reduced levels of melatonin , a hormone which plays a role in inducing sleepiness			1
and they took nearly ten minutes longer to fall asleep after reading an e-reader compared to reading a printed book			0
they also had a lower amount of rapid eye movement sleep – a stage thought to be crucial because it is when memories are consolidated			0
regular books are better before bed because screens have an ' extremely powerful effect ' on the body ’s natural sleep pattern lead researcher dr @entity79 said screens can have an ‘ extremely powerful effect ’ on the body ’s natural sleep pattern the study was carried out by @entity84 and @entity86 universities in the @entity87 and published in the @entity88			1
lead researcher dr @entity79 said screens can have an ‘ extremely powerful effect ’ on the body ’s natural sleep pattern			1
she added : ‘ participants reading a light - emitting @entity93 took longer to fall asleep and had reduced evening sleepiness , reduced melatonin secretion , later timing of their circadian clock and reduced next - morning alertness than when reading a printed book			1
’ dr @entity100 from @entity86 , who contributed to the study , added : ‘ in the past 50 years , there has been a decline in average sleep duration and quality			0
‘ since more people are choosing electronic devices for reading , communication and entertainment – particularly children and adolescents who already experience significant sleep loss – research evaluating the long - term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed			1

blue light emitted by modern devices can knock out body ’s natural rhythm
people who regularly read electronic books before bed sleep fewer hours
the @entity8 readers had reduced levels of melatonin , a hormone which normally rises in the evening and plays a role in inducing sleepiness
