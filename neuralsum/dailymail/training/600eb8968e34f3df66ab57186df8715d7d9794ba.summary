@entity0 took a public stand against @entity2 on tuesday , joining the chorus of calls for the @entity6 president to resign and describing his accusation that the @entity9 media is racist as ‘ offensive ’			1
@entity0 was one of only two leading football officials who challenged @entity2 after the 78 - year - old @entity11 had delivered a speech to @entity14 @entity13 here in @entity16			1
@entity2 sparked fresh controversy on monday when he claimed allegations of corruption around the @entity21 victory to host the @entity22 was being driven by the ‘ racism and discrimination ’ of the ‘ @entity9 media ’			1
eyes on the prize : @entity2 on stage with @entity30 model @entity28 at a @entity6 gala on tuesday evening on stage : @entity32 - presenting at the @entity13 - alongside under - fire @entity2 ( right ) tough crowd : @entity2 and @entity34 attend the @entity35 of the 64th @entity13 @entity36 out the red carpet : @entity2 ( arriving with @entity34 on tuesday ) has come under siege this week @entity39 chairman @entity0 said he found the remarks ‘ completely unacceptable ’ and stood up to the @entity6 president in an auditorium at the city ’s @entity43			1
‘ the only reason i did it was because of what mr @entity2 said yesterday , which i found , as i ’m sure many of you found , offensive , ’ he said			2
@entity0 shared his response to @entity2 with the media			1
‘ i said : “ could i say that i regard the comments you made yesterday about the allegations in the @entity9 media in which you described them as racist as totally unacceptable			1
i have read the articles in the @entity59 in great detail , and the allegations being made have nothing to do with racism			2
they are allegations about corruption within @entity6			1
‘ these allegations need to be properly investigated and properly answered			0
we need to know from mr @entity67 ( @entity67 , the independent @entity6 investigator ) tomorrow if he was aware of the material in the @entity59 before it was published and , if not , whether he will now extend his investigation to consider these allegations			2
‘ mr @entity2 , many of us are deeply troubled by your reaction to these allegations			2
it ’s time for @entity6 to stop attacking the messenger and instead consider and understand the message			2
’ @entity0 said @entity2 did not react as he stood at a lectern on the stage			1
‘ he said it would be addressed tomorrow in @entity13 , ’ said @entity0			0
@entity82 , the former @entity83 chief executive and current member of the @entity14 executive committee , echoed @entity0 in a press conference after the @entity89 governing body ’s meeting had finished			0
when @entity0 was asked if @entity2 should now stand for re-election next year , he replied : ‘ @entity91 has real concerns			1
opposition : @entity2 addresses the room during a meeting of @entity14 federations in @entity16 fury : both @entity39 chairman @entity0 and @entity39 's @entity14 vice-president @entity82 are unhappy with @entity2 ‘ obviously there would have to be a decision made by the @entity39 board but i think that we all accept that four years ago he ( @entity2 ) said he was only standing for one more term			1
‘ we were asked at a meeting fairly recently and our view was that among the @entity9 public there was n’t any doubt that brand @entity6 is severely damaged			1
and i suspect that ’s the same throughout large parts of @entity89			0
‘ i suspect there is a view within the @entity39 that we would support that position ( that @entity2 should stand down ) but we will decide that at the board , which is the proper place			2
’ pressed for his personal view , @entity0 then said : ‘ it ’s certainly @entity91 ’s view and we all accept that four years ago he said he would stay on for one more term and he should probably stick to that ‘ in these circumstances , when a third of the @entity120 has already resigned due to corruption allegations , i think what you want … there have been serious allegations that need to be investigated			1
should he stay or should he go ? @entity2 has indicated he plans to run for another term as @entity6 president ‘ if they turn out to be true then it ’s difficult for a chief executive figure to continue in most circumstances			1
’ it was a courageous stance for @entity0 to take , particularly when @entity89 ’s opposition could prove futile given the widespread global support @entity2 has appeared to retain this week			1
there was no standing ovation at the end of @entity139 – indeed he needed the protection @entity16 ’s @entity142 riot police to enter the @entity14 hotel - but from continents like @entity145 and @entity146 that has been the reaction , and at the end of the day @entity89 have just 53 of the 209 votes for the president			0
@entity151 , also the vice-chairman of the @entity39 , nevertheless backed @entity0			2
‘ that statement made by mr @entity2 was , from our perspective , totally unacceptable and factually incorrect , ’ he said			1
‘ to attempt to portray it as a racial or discriminatory attack is totally unacceptable			2
‘ what is important is we test that information			0
we should be saying we ’re not happy about it , what are we going to do about it and let ’s investigate it fully			0
‘ we ca n’t have football being the number one game in the world , growing year by year , without having that responsibility around it			0
’ time to go ? @entity151 has urged @entity6 president @entity2 , 78 , not to stand for a fifth term asked for his view on 78 - year - old @entity2 ’s decision to stand for a fifth term , @entity151 said : ‘ i ’m surprised			1
i think the very fact that in 2011 he was clear that it was for four years , i think that should have been the situation			0
‘ to see he has changed his mind is disappointing			0
’ asked whether @entity2 should go , @entity151 then replied : ‘ personally , yes			2
i think we need to move on			0
but that 's just my personal opinion			0
there are 209 countries voting for the new president			0
‘ but if i was the chief executive and i had these allegations and these concerns , i would n't look at them negatively and blame people for bringing them forward			0
‘ i think @entity6 would benefit significantly from a change			0
if you look at what happened at the @entity190 , the @entity190 is now a much more respected organisation			0
’ before @entity0 stood up to challenge @entity2 , @entity194 federation president @entity193 tore into the under - fire @entity6 president			1
@entity196 might yet emerge as @entity14 ’s choice to stand against @entity2 next year and the fact that he is a @entity6 @entity120 member was certainly significant			1
way back : @entity151 with @entity2 at the @entity202 game between @entity83 and @entity203 in 2009 in the behind - closed - doors @entity139 it is understood he told @entity206 : ‘ in the last eight or nine years , @entity6 has built an ugly reputation , not only in the press but you only have to look at @entity211 - # @entity6 @entity206 # @entity210			1
‘ there are reasons – bribery , money and corruption are so often linked			0
@entity6 has a bad reputation			0
@entity6 has an executive person and if you like it or not , you have a responsibility			0
’ to the media @entity196 then said : ‘ i took the floor and i said that if you look at the reputation @entity6 has built over the last 7 to 8 years , with accusations of corruption , bribery and all kinds of old - boy network things , @entity6 has an executive president and that means you are responsible			1
‘ you do n't make it very easy on yourself because what you said on @entity21 was the wrong choice , which means you blame your executive committee			0
‘ all these problems occurred when you were president so i believe that you should not run anymore			0
’ responding to @entity2 ’s accusations of racism , @entity196 said : ‘ i was not happy because this has nothing to do with racism			2

@entity2 claimed on monday that racism was behind corruption allegations
@entity0 said his comments about the @entity9 media were ' totally unacceptable '
and @entity151 has called on the @entity6 president not to stand for another term
