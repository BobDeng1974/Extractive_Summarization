the hotly debated @entity63 - to - @entity64 oil pipeline cleared final @entity66 approval and was bound for the desk of president @entity2 , who has vowed to veto the law the @entity1 house speaker was flanked at the formal enrollment ceremony by @entity70 , president of the @entity31 's @entity71 , senate majority leader @entity41 , and the bill 's author , @entity52 sen. @entity42 , among other @entity1 members of @entity66 from states that would be directly affected by the realization of the @entity78 portion of the transnational conduit			1
' we 're hoping common sense will prevail here , and the president will sign this extraordinary jobs bill , ' @entity80 said			2
both the @entity8 and the @entity61 have ok 'd the @entity5 expansion multiple times yet never with enough votes to override @entity2 's promised vetoes			1
a @entity8 vote on wednesday to pass the latest @entity61 bill drew 29 democrats and passed 270 to 152 , falling 20 votes short of what was needed			1

a @entity8 spokesman confirmed on thursday that @entity2 had not changed his mind			2
' as you know , the approval process for this pipeline is one that predates this administration , and is hubbed at the @entity104			0
we 're going to let that process unfold , ' @entity2 spokesman @entity114 told reporters travelling with the president			0
' the president has announced that he would oppose and veto any legislative maneuvering to circumvent that process			0
so he will indeed be vetoing it			0
' the @entity104 paused its review process last spring as it awaited the verdict of the @entity125 and has not publicly announced plans to restart it			0
not gon na happen : the @entity8 has said in no uncertain terms that @entity2 wo n't lend his name to the @entity5 expansion bill and anxious lawmakers will just have to wait for the @entity104 to resume its stalled review of the permit request for the oil transportation system though @entity7 signed the bill today he will not immediately send it to 1600 @entity136 ave. following monday 's federal holiday , @entity66 is scheduled to be in recess for the remainder of the week			1
@entity42 told reporters on thursday the legislative branch would wait until it resumed its activities to present @entity2 with the document ' so attention is brought to it ' when he rejects it			0

@entity1 ' inability to force the bill into law , despite having majorities in both chambers of @entity66 and the support of more than three dozen of their colleagues across the aisle , highlighted the struggle the @entity1 faces during @entity2 's last two years in office			1
' now we have the @entity61 and so our constituents think " now you can stop @entity2 "			0
well we do n't have 60 , ' @entity165 rep. @entity164 told the @entity166 on thursday , referring to the number of votes it takes in the @entity61 to overcome a minority party filibuster			2
' honestly it 's going to continue to frustrate not only our side but the people who elected us that nothing is going to change until we get a new president , ' he said , acknowledging the virtual stalemate .			0
