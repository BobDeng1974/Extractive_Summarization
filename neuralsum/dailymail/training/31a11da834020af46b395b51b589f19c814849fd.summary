@entity0 opened their doors to a remarkable £ 40million training facility on wednesday , yet their main hope is that the scented massage rooms , bacteria - killing washing machines and ‘ @entity6 ’ can , at the very least , match the talent - reaping brilliance achieved in the portacabins of their past			1
@entity12 was invited to a behind - the - scenes look at the new @entity16 facility , a stunning home to the brilliant minds and methods that have done so much to create one of the most celebrated production lines in @entity23 football			1
‘ five years ago we had a single - storey brick building and cabins , ’ said chairman @entity24			1
today , in a centre named after the @entity48 , the @entity46 ’s second - ranked club have a training centre that @entity51 , their technical director , hopes might yet produce enough homegrown players to fill half the first team			1
another aspiration , spoken by several at this club , is to see @entity0 ultimately gatecrash the top four			1
on arrival at this remote @entity61 base , the scale of the operation is obvious			2
there are nine training pitches , ranging from the 60x40 - yard surface used by the @entity66 eights to the one next to the pavilion that uses the same type of turf and matches the dimensions of the @entity72 ’s pitch			1
‘ everything here is about progression , ’ said @entity51			2
‘ the eight - year - olds want to get from that pitch to this one , right next to the pavilion			1
they start in small football , one v one , two v two			2
concentrate on the game not the system			2
@entity46 high - fliers @entity0 unveiled a new state - of - the - art training centre on wednesday @entity85 celebrates with team - mates @entity86 ( left ) and @entity88 ( right ) after his winner at @entity90 last weekend the @entity0 academy and first - team players will be able to relax in the pools after training or when recovering from injury former @entity0 owner @entity36 pictured when taking over the club in 2009 with former boss @entity97 ( left ) the extensive gym and training areas will enable @entity0 's players to work on their strength and fitness of the pitches ‘ they learn the principles of attack and defend			1
the teams from under 15 and up will have a flexible variant on 4 - 3 - 3 ( as they do at @entity109 ’s famed academy ) , but the kids start with a ball and they learn to play , to think for themselves			1
‘ if they progress they go from the academy and under 21 dining room to the first - team dining room			1
’ cameras are next to the pitches – nine to be precise , with another 16 cameras on the way			2
‘ we want to have every view that might make us better , ’ said @entity119 , their head of recruitment			2
the footage from those cameras is studied live by eight analysts , with a dedicated analyst for each of the @entity129 and @entity66 21 squads			2
all those training on these pitches have already been scrutinised physically and mentally by the recruitment team and scouting group of four , led by @entity134 , who was central to the discoveries of @entity43 and so many others			1
their scouting network includes a further 30 ‘ consultants ’ out in the field			2
their latest tool is called the ‘ @entity6 ’			0
it ’s a two - tiered windowless room next to the analysis suite , with a huge touchscreen and viewing gallery			1
‘ it is our own software , ’ @entity119 said			0
‘ i wo n’t tell you how much it cost because i ’d rather other clubs did not know			0
in here , the manager will come to see what we have compiled on prospective new players			0
’ the gym at the @entity157 , with machines displaying the club crest , is of the finest quality @entity0 want all the players from the different age groups to be integrated into one at the new training centre the software processes the vast information compiled on potential senior signings and junior recruits , from school grades to video clips			1
when the club rebuilt its decimated squad in the summer , many of @entity28 ’s final decisions were shaped in this room			1
‘ it is all about making up the small percentages , ’ @entity51 said			0
it extends to the laundry room of kit man @entity180			0
‘ we spent 18 months researching the washing machines , ’ he said			0
the amount of oxygen pumped into these specific machines has all but eliminated bacteria from kit			1
‘ it all helps keep the players healthy , ’ @entity180 added			0
they are also known to bring bespoke mattresses to away matches			0
then there are the two massage rooms			0
‘ you can change the lighting , the smell and music – it is hard to measure the impact but , along with our psychology department , we want to see if they stimulate certain hormones , ’ said @entity195 , the sports science and medicine manager			0
‘ we want them to help a player relax on a recovery day or invigorate them on a hard training day			0
’ @entity213 ace @entity44 and @entity214 superstar @entity43 both graduated from @entity0 's academy before moving on @entity217 internationals @entity216 and @entity218 also progressed through the @entity0 academy before moving on @entity195 ’s department claim to have statistics from a @entity223 audit that shows they are best ranked in the @entity46 for injury prevention over the past two seasons			1
in context , he estimates his department , that also studies the running patterns of the eight - year - olds , is half the size of that at @entity234			1
to be achieving more than a club of such resources seems implausible			2
‘ the challenge now is staying ahead , ’ said @entity195			0
‘ it ’s not just the young players here who have to progress			0
we have done well so far			0
you ’d hope this magnificent facility adds a bit more			0
we want to punch above our weight			0
’ so far so good .			0
