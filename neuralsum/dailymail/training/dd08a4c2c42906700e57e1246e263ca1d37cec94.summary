the biggest shake - up of performance rules for 40 years was ordered by ministers amid concerns that the current regulations are ' archaic , complex and irrelevant '			1

changes : tv talent shows will be forced to apply for licences to feature child stars under new proposals			0
@entity28 's @entity27 was criticised three years ago when @entity29 , pictured , started crying after struggling to complete a song this includes programmes that are billed as observational or factual , but actually put a child into a contrived situation			1
rules on including children in performances , including tv , radio , film or theatre , were last reformed in 1968 - a time when there were just three television channels and a small number of radio stations			1
those rules stated that a licence was needed for under - 14s who would be singing , dancing , acting or taking part in musical performances			2
but there have been suggestions that this left a grey area between factual programming and entertainment shows that is not covered by the rules , and has left some producers unsure if they need a licence			0

new proposals : children 's minister @entity74 , pictured , said current rules are outdated , complex , confusing and not fit for purpose ' they come from an age when there were just three television channels and bear no relation to the broadcasting or performing industries in the 21st century			1
' the rules are incredibly complex , bureaucratic and patchily applied - meaning that many amateur dramatic groups simply do not involve children in their plans , which is ridiculous			2
' the proposals say that a parent must take responsibility for their child 's activities , and producers will have to show they have strong safeguarding measures in place before they apply for a licence			0
under the last @entity116 government , then schools secretary @entity114 ordered a review of child performance rules amid fears that youngsters were being exploited by reality tv			2
at the time , mr @entity114 said he was not attempting to stop children from appearing on talent shows , on stage or in documentaries			0
