by @entity0 follow @ @ samcunningham @entity1 is a bulldog of a player ; he is snarling , growling , teeth baring			1
he kicks out , stamps , swears into cameras , criticises his own fans			2
perfect for a @entity9 captain			1
the forward is set to be named as the next man to lead @entity13 's side in what @entity9 fans are hoping will be a new era of success			1
he would not be the first maverick captain – and if the others are anything to go by it could be just what the club needs			1
he scored the winning goal against @entity39 then let out an almighty roar as he lifted the trophy above his head			0
the following season , he was made club captain by sir @entity44			1
had he not announced his shock retirement after a year , he may have continued on for many more			2
this was a player stalked by controversy			0
he spat at a @entity50 fan in his first season at @entity9 , following his switch from the @entity54 club in november 1992			1
there is the infamous karate kick on a supporter at @entity58 three years later and the horrible stamp on @entity60			0
yet in equal measures he produced moments of genius			0
there was the sublime chip against @entity66 , the volley against @entity68 in the @entity35 and the thunderbolt free - kick against @entity70			2
he scored vital goals – a crucial one away to @entity72 on the way to winning the title in 1993 , two penalties at @entity76 in the 1994 @entity77 to secure the club 's first league and cup double and that winner against @entity39 in the 1996 @entity77			2
they won three league titles and two @entity35 cups in the five years he was at the club – including one league title in his final year as captain			1
video @entity9 return after successful tour - @entity1 favourite for captaincy @entity92 : @entity33 was a phenomenal talent and a huge fans favourite at @entity9 in control : @entity33 captained @entity9 in the 1996 - 1997 campaign - his last at the club @entity33 puffed his chest out , raised his collar , strutted on and off the pitch and was a born winner			1
he was an artist ; the football pitch his canvas , the ball his paint brushes and the goalposts his masterpiece			0
it made him a leader			0
@entity1 , too , has shown those flashes of brilliance which were so common in @entity33 's career			1
the overhead kick against @entity114 in in 2011 , the first - time volley against @entity116 in 2005 seconds after screaming at referee @entity117			2
@entity1 has been doing it since the moment he announced himself on the scene aged 16 with that 30 - yard curler against @entity70 in 2002			1
these are the moments which can fill his team - mates with confidence that their captain can conjure something out of nowhere to drag them back into a tie or win a game at the death			1
it was none other than @entity134 who picked up the mantle from @entity33 in 1997			1
his bullish aggression and flawed genius made him a perfect replacement in @entity44 's eyes			2
legends : both @entity134 and @entity33 will go down in @entity9 folklore for their contributions to the club @entity134 missed most of that first season , injuring his cruciate ligament in a tackle with @entity148 , who then stood over @entity134 and accused him of trying to hurt him			1
it was a moment he would live to regret			0
when @entity134 returned he led @entity9 to the @entity150 , @entity35 and @entity152 treble			1
he missed the @entity152 final after picking up a yellow card for a trip on @entity156 in the semi-final against @entity158 , but that suspension was indicative of his style			0
he was another who , throughout all the trophies and silverware , refused to hold back			0
he entered into a furious row with the club after demanding a new contract only for officials to say season ticket prices went up to fund it			0
he launched a stinging attack on fans at @entity172 after a @entity152 match against @entity174 in 2000			1
' away from home our fans are fantastic , ' he said			0
' i 'd call them the hardcore fans			0
but at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches , and they do n't realise what 's going on out on the pitch			2
i do n't think some of the people who come to @entity172 can spell ' football ' , never mind understand it			1
' class : @entity134 led @entity9 to four league titles as captain at @entity172 later in his reign he claimed his team - mates ' forgot about the game , lost the hunger that got you the @entity198 , the cars , the mansion			1
' he sought his revenge for the clash with @entity148 and admitted he intentionally hurt the player when he was sent of for a disgusting knee - high challenge in 2001			2
' i 'd waited long enough , ' he said afterwards			0
' i f * * * * * * hit him hard			0
the ball was there ( i think )			0
take that you c * * t. and do n't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries			0
' he was banned for a further five matches , to add to his initial three			0
amid all the carnage , it did n't stop them winning four league titles , two @entity218 , the @entity152 and much more while he was captain			2
@entity1 has that fire about him and his career is filled with moments of explosive anger , too			1
more to come ? @entity1 could go on to lift the @entity150 title as @entity9 captain in the future @entity228 : @entity1 will be hoping he can take his game to the next level under @entity13 he stamped on @entity231 in the 2006 @entity233 quarter - final against @entity234 then pushed club team - mate @entity235 after being sent off			1
he was shown a red card for needlessly kicking @entity238 in @entity240 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity241 in the final qualifier for @entity243 and was initially banned for all three of their group matches , although it was later reduced to two			1
he has pushed @entity246 , swore at @entity247 and again at @entity240 's entire bench after being substituted in a friendly against @entity250 then throwing to the floor a red armband worn in memory of the late @entity254			2
like @entity134 , he is not afraid to confront his own fans and criticised @entity240 supporters for booing the team off the pitch in their goalless draw with @entity260 at the 2008 @entity233			1
' @entity261 to see your home fans boo you , ' he raged at a camera beaming back into every home in the country			0
as well as that he was banned for swearing into a camera after scoring a hat - trick against @entity269 in 2011			2
it earned him a two - match suspension and he missed the @entity35 semi-final			2
even in accepting the ban , he refused not to have the final say			0
' i am not the first player to have sworn on tv and i wo n't be the last , ' he said			0
' unlike others who have been caught swearing on camera , i apologised immediately			0
and yet i am the only person banned for swearing			0
that does n't seem right			0
' through all the screaming and shouting and scrapping , @entity1 could be the perfect captain for @entity9 after all .			1

@entity1 is reportedly set to be named @entity9 's captain
the 28 - year - old has been in impressive form in pre-season
the @entity9 forward will hope to replicate the success @entity134 and @entity33 both had when they were skippers at @entity172
