by @entity0 from plank hats to frilly hotpants , @entity2 's leading platform for men 's fashion is no stranger to the bizarre ensemble			1
but designer @entity8 took things a step further when she sent models down the catwalk in neoprene mankinis			2
the unusual two - pieces were joined by billowing printed capes in an array of zany hues , flowing silk board shorts , crop tops and even , for one poor model , a fringed bodycon dress			2
others sported strapless dresses , cut just below the nipple , which came in bright fluorescent pink , high viz orange , subtle black and a pretty shade of cobalt blue			0
unusual look : models sporting strapless dresses by designer @entity8 hit the runway on day one of @entity33 : men bizarre : a model in a neoprene and lace cycling shorts and crop top combo ( left ) and right , a heavily tattooed model in a pair of parachute silk printed board shorts floaty : a model in a billowing cape strides down the catwalk at @entity8 sporty : a model in a sheer mesh top and cycling shorts , and a cropped jacket on the catwalk all dressed up : a model shows off a fringed neoprene dress at @entity8 and @entity56 was n't the only one bent on raising eyebrows			1
at @entity62 , models sporting candy stripes and summer brights chomped on cigars as they posed on the catwalk during the presentation			2
then , at @entity67 , a distinctly feminine palette took centre stage with cleverly cut jackets in coral teamed with shorts that finished just above the knee , and a delicate pale pink parachute silk blouse			0
equally quirky were the offerings at @entity75 , a show designed to showcase the best of @entity2 's up - and - coming creative talent , where wacky masks , a skin - tight all - in - one and a @entity82 costume all took centre stage			1
luckily for the models at @entity86 : men , which opened in the capital today , not every designer was bent on making headlines for all the wrong reasons			0
also on the runway today were pieces by @entity94 , where creative director @entity95 took an more tailored approach to menswear , showing beautifully cut suits in delicate summer pastels			1
@entity101 : a model sporting a bizarre face covering headdress on the catwalk at man all in one : designer @entity107 sent a skin tight all in one down the runway during the man show pioneering : an ensemble by @entity112 during the man show at @entity33 : men quirky : a model in a denim cape and a feathered hat strides down the runway ( left ) , followed by another in a @entity120 inspired ensemble - both by @entity112 at man smokin ! models puff on cigars as they show off their clothes during the @entity126 presentation during @entity33 : men puffing away : despite the cigars , there were plenty of fabulous pieces to be found during the @entity132 presentation at @entity33 : men in the pink : @entity67 showed a collection dominated by salmon pink and coral hues unconventional : an ensemble by newcomer @entity139 on the runway pared back : @entity67 also included a pared back shell pink blouse in her menswear collection @entity144 , sugared violet , cornflower blue and palest apricot : all were present and correct , with @entity95 even managing to make them look masculine , courtesy of mod sunglasses and foppish @entity152 style haircuts			1
happily for those not yet ready to be prised away from their black , @entity95 followed up with wideboy suits in charcoal and black , teamed with chunky knits emblazoned with zig - zags , and wearable black and grey striped @entity158			2
there was one less than sharp addition however			0
watched by a starry front row that included @entity164 @entity163 , model @entity165 and fellow clothes horse @entity167 , every look was accessorised with bright white trainers			0
it was a rare dose of sportiness in what was otherwise a collection aimed wholly at the dapper gent , who is certainly not the sort of chap who would shop at @entity179 - the big name brand which got @entity2 collections : men off to a star - studded start last night			0
here , sports - casual dominated with khaki board shorts and scruffy - cool camouflage vests taking to the runway in front of a dapper crowd that included actor @entity191 and model @entity192			0
return of the @entity194 : @entity94 sent models sporting delicate pastel coloured suits down the runway during their show at @entity33 : men floral reign : a model hits the catwalk in a floral garland during the @entity205 show 70s redux : a brown and yellow grandad knit on the catwalk during the @entity94 show looking good : a model on the catwalk in a pinstriped tunic at @entity205 @entity214 : along with pastel suits , @entity95 's collection for @entity94 was heavy on the graphic print and tailored trousers kicking off : @entity179 opened @entity2 collections : men with a unisex show on saturday night that was watched by @entity192 among others			1

@entity94 , @entity8 , @entity62 and @entity75 were among those to show their collections on day one
among the more bizarre looks on offer were the neoprene bodycon dresses and *bikinis* at @entity231
equally odd were the @entity120 inspired looks and face - covering masks at new talent platform , man
@entity94 's @entity95 showed *gorgeous* tailored suits in apricot , cornflower and sugared violet hues
