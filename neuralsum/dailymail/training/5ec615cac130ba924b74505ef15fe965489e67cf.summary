his foreign secretary said last week that the only way to revive @entity4 's flagging economy was to work harder			2
but it appears @entity7 's blunt words may not apply to @entity8 who found time to go home and change into jeans before whisking his wife out for a swanky meal last night			1
with thoughts of the recession , the euro meltdown and @entity14 placed firmly to one side ' call me @entity19 ' seemed determined to enjoy ' date night ' at @entity20 in north @entity21			1
with its salmon - pink decor and retro puddings , critics say the @entity27 restaurant is like stepping back into the 1970s			1
did you have to wear that coat darling ? @entity8 and wife @entity30 dress down for a night out at @entity27 restaurant @entity20 in north @entity21 sartorial flair : as ever mrs @entity32 got it right in a classic @entity35 top and navy trousers with classic taupe coat unlike ' @entity38 ' who looked like he was off to scoff pie and mash down the local boozer that decade was dogged by strikes and economic decline too , which may explain why mr @entity8 chose to dine at @entity20 instead of his regular haunts in upmarket @entity47			1
according to a source , the @entity48 had been celebrating a family birthday at the restaurant			2
after tucking into half a dozen oysters and the veal chop the prime minister is thought to have eaten a slice of birthday cake before heading home			1
in a recent interview he explained how his weekly date night with his wife was important for maintaining a healthy marriage			2
but the only way to bring colour back into the economy 's cheeks after the @entity4 plunged into its first double - dip recession since 1975 is hard work , according to mr @entity7			2
speaking to @entity68 , he delivered a hammer blow to the country 's bosses saying they should stop complaining and get on with reviving economy			2
work harder : foreign secretary @entity7 delivered a hammer blow to the country 's bosses saying they should stop complaining and get on with reviving economy by working harder with its salmon - pink decor and tempting dessert trolley , @entity27 restaurant @entity20 has changed little since opening its doors in 1970			1
it attracts an older , loyal clientele who wolf down bulging glasses of lobster cocktail and whole globe artichokes			2
@entity8 last night dined on half a dozen oysters and veal chop , according to a source			1
but the restaurant in north @entity21 also serves up classic beef @entity87 , steak , @entity90 and is well known for its fresh fish and seafood			1
the dinner menu is a fixed price of £ 42.50 with some dishes carrying a small surcharge , allowing you to splash out on a nice bottle of plonk			0
a bottle of the @entity101 will set you back £ 199			0
puds come courtesy of @entity105 waiter @entity104 who wheels out his dessert trolley groaning with lemon meringue and tarts in every colour			0
current owner @entity113 - who is ' sadly not @entity27 but @entity114 ' - says he 's well used to seeing famous faces in the restaurant			1
' @entity117 was in last week and we 've had @entity119			0
everyone comes here , ' mr @entity113 told the @entity121 before adding that bar mr @entity8 he had n't seen many @entity124 members for a while			1
mr @entity7 may be glad to hear it			0
' i think they should be getting on with the task of creating more of those jobs and more of those exports , rather than complaining about it , ' he said			0
asked if his comments could be compared to lord @entity137 's ' on your bike ' message to the unemployed in the 1980s , mr @entity7 said : ' it 's more than that			0
it 's get on the plane , go and sell things overseas , go and study overseas			0
' it 's much more than getting on the bike , the bike did n't go that far			0
' his comments are a direct riposte to business leaders , including chief executive of @entity152 's @entity151 , who criticised the lack of measures for economic growth in the @entity156 last week			0
mr @entity7 , a former comprehensive schoolboy from @entity157 whose parents manufactured soft drinks , is seen as the best person to deliver the tough message , rather than @entity8 or @entity162 , who have been criticised for their privileged backgrounds			1
but mr @entity8 's privileged background does not appear to have influenced his sartorial choices			1
in a classic breton top , stone - coloured jacket and navy trousers , his wife look her usual chic self			0
but with his shiny ' dad ' anorak and pointy work shoes , ' call me @entity19 ' looked ready for pie and mash down the local boozer rather than a lobster cocktail in plush surroundings			0
in a recent interview the prime minister described himself as a ' romantic ' and revealed that he tries to take his wife out for dinner on @entity185 - if he remembers to book a table early enough			0
he also revealed he and his wife have a couple of favourite @entity189 restaurants in upmarket @entity47 , west @entity21			1
mr @entity8 's image took yet another battering earlier this week when he revealed that @entity192 , by @entity193 was his favourite album			1
already hounded for being ‘ out of touch ’ during the economic crisis , critics pointed out that the album appears a fitting choice , featuring tracks including @entity201 , and @entity202			0
labour leader @entity203 also delivered a hammer blow during the @entity206 's speech at the @entity207 last week			0
he said : ' in two years , this prime minister has gone from @entity8 to @entity209			2
' keeping it alive : mr @entity8 said the couple 's weekly date nights help to keep their 16 - year marriage going			2
