by @entity1 reporter published : 11:57 est , 16 july 2012 updated : 03:34 est , 17 july 2012 desperate for success : policeman @entity3 falsely issued hundreds of fines to be successful at work he made a name for himself after wrestling a gun from the hands of a woman who was pointing it at a young boy			1
and after his spell in the limelight , it appears pcso @entity3 was determined to keep up the crime - fighting			1
but the 48 - year - old ’s desire for success ended in shame yesterday when the @entity21 was jailed for six months for issuing hundreds of false fixed penalty notices			2
@entity3 was the first @entity15 in @entity23 to be awarded the commendation of the high sheriff of @entity23 after wrestling a gun from a woman ’s hands at @entity28 in 2009			1
he was given the award by then @entity31 police commissioner sir @entity30 for pinning down the armed suspect after she pointed the weapon at a boy			0
but the @entity35 - based @entity15 was so hungry for success he began inventing bogus penalty notices , usually for cycling on the pavement			1
@entity3 targeted members of the public after finding their names and addresses on items of lost property			1
some victims paid the fines – which started at £ 45 and quickly increased to £ 320 – while others spent hours arguing about them in court			1
one woman who was issued a false notice had bailiffs come to her home chasing £ 320 in fines			1
another ticket was issued to a man who had suffered nerve damage to his arm and could not even ride a bike			0
although the exact number of false notices issued is unknown , investigating detectives found at least 350 suspect tickets between february 2010 and september last year			0
@entity3 was caught out after a man fined for cycling on the pavement on the @entity66 complained			1
when police searched the officer ’s home they found a canister of @entity73 gas which had been reported missing from a police locker room			0
humiliated victims : one woman was falsely fined £ 320 by mr @entity3 and was left embarrassed and humiliated @entity76 , prosecuting , said : ‘ one woman was stopped at @entity28 coach station with friends and had bailiffs come to her house after she was ordered to pay £ 320 in fines			1
‘ she had to come to a subsequent court hearing , and in her own words felt embarrassed and humiliated , due to mr @entity3			2
‘ another man who paid a £ 45 fine later told police that he had an accident in 1997 and suffered nerve damage to his left arm and shoulder			1
he said he could not use a bicycle if he wanted to			0
’ @entity3 , of @entity91 , admitted one count of misconduct in a public office and possession of a prohibited weapon			2
judge @entity97 said : ‘ it ’s an abuse of power by someone who is given power and then decides to use that power in a bad way			2
as a pcso he had a power and used it in a crazy way which is extremely harmful			0
‘ you have a positively good character , for some seven years as a pcso in which i ’m told you loved , and indeed did extremely well in			0
‘ you were serving the public but that trust placed in you , you abused			0
lost property : mr @entity3 targeted cyclists using personal details found on lost property ‘ what motivated you is and remains entirely unclear			2
there was no financial gain , there was no corruption , there was no acting on behalf of criminals or friends			1
‘ it seems to me , what you chose to do having been given power , was to abuse that power			0
‘ the public have to be confident in the fixed penalty notice system and you undermined that confidence			0
‘ confidence in the @entity15 community has also been undermined			2
’ @entity136 - @entity135 , defending , said @entity3 had been sacked as a @entity15 and had moved back to his native @entity137 , where he worked as a part - time cleaner			1
she added : ‘ it would appear there was no motivation other than a desire to be successful in his job			0
‘ i do n’t think he understands himself though what led him to take these actions			0

@entity3 falsely fined victims £ 45 - £ 320
he had been awarded for *bravery* in 2009
his motive was to be successful at work , not for financial gain
@entity157 said the @entity15 abused his power
