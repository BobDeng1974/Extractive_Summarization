the @entity0 told the @entity2 board they would stump up whatever was required to prevent @entity4 being used as security on a loan to @entity7			1
the @entity9 - led group also revealed how their bid to secure a guarantee for the stadium was recently kicked out by the powerbrokers – giving rise to the ‘ abhorrent ’ notion that it will now be mortgaged			0
the prospect of the @entity18 owner getting the title deeds to the stadium moved into clear view when his company served notice of its intention to use it as collateral on a £ 10million loan			1
@entity7 , who has already loaned the club £ 3m , plans to extend its credit facility with him by using its prized asset and the @entity34 training complex as security			1
@entity7 has filed documents notifying land register bosses that he plans to take out security on @entity4 news of the development – emerging from documents filed with the registers of @entity43 - was met with widespread anger by fans groups – with many highlighting the fact the board had repeatedly stated their famous ground was sacrosanct			1
now the @entity49 are set to attend the @entity50 today in a bid to have an interim interdict granted against security over @entity4 being issued			1
the development could also force a push for drastic boardroom changes via an egm but , as of the close of @entity60 business yesterday , @entity61 , the man thought most likely to call one , had not done so			0
the @entity4 board had been negotiating with the @entity9 - led consortium – knows as the @entity0 – to address its drastic cash shortage			2
the future of @entity2 remains uncertain due to the club 's drastic financial situation that faction , which owns circa 20 per cent of the club , had been seeking two boardroom seats in return for a £ 5m investment			2
this would be transferred into equity through a forthcoming share issue			0
those negotiations have been fruitless , however , as @entity7 ’s move means no other group can use @entity4 or @entity34 as security for 35 days			1
it ’s believed the @entity79 had earmarked @entity34 for their purposes			2
last night the three – @entity9 , @entity84 and @entity85 – responded to @entity7 ’s move by insisting they ’d gladly up their level of investment if it meant keeping @entity4 out of his clutches			1
furthermore , they revealed a request to keep @entity4 free of any security during the talks was flatly rejected			1
a consortium spokesman said : ‘ if we are to believe the @entity100 report then the @entity97 may be suffering from a bout of amnesia			0
‘ a £ 5m funding package was offered by us after discussions with @entity105 regarding the amount required by the club			2
if the @entity97 are now saying they need more than £ 5m then we are prepared to increase our funding package to begin the process of putting @entity2 back on a firm financial footing			0
‘ we hope this can be agreed soon so we can put an end to the suffering of @entity2 fans who have been shown complete disregard for far too long			0
@entity18 owner @entity7 is not yet ready to give up his grip on power at @entity2 ‘ @entity2 supporters deserve greater respect and it would be foolish to take them for granted			1
they have had enough and will not take any more			0
‘ our initial funding offer also asked for a negative pledge on @entity4 , which is a guarantee that security over that asset could n’t be given to anyone else			1
‘ this condition was refused by the @entity97 and we accepted this on the basis of the @entity97 ’s previous statements that @entity4 would be sacrosanct			2
‘ @entity2 fans , including ourselves , do not want @entity4 given over as security to anyone			1
the very notion is abhorrent to us and that it is even being considered suggests at best a lack of understanding of what @entity4 rep - resents and at worst a callous disrespect			0
‘ there is absolutely no need for @entity4 to be used as security when there are people ready and committed to offer more than adequate funding while at the same time protecting the stadium			1
’ confirming moves were afoot to grant security over the stadium , a @entity2 statement to the @entity149 read : ‘ the directors confirm that they are currently consider - ing various proposals to secure the financial future of the club , however no decision has been made at this time			0
’ however , fans fear their club could be in thrall to @entity7 for years to come were he to take possession of the title deeds to the stadium in the event of a default on the loan			1
the @entity49 said they were ‘ taking urgent legal advice regarding this attempt by the board of @entity2 to pass the most prized assets of the club to @entity7 ’			2
the @entity4 club have turned down a £ 20million bid by @entity175 financier @entity174 ‘ we believe the board may be acting illegally on two fronts and we will be working with any other shareholder who wishes to challenge this			1
if necessary we will instigate legal action against the directors both collectively and individually			0
‘ we have also contacted several mps and will be seeking political and government support to stop this attempted asset grab			0
’ the @entity187 accused the board of lying to fans , while imploring a boycott of tonight ’s crucial match with @entity192			0
fan ownership group @entity193 also went public with its dismay at the latest development			0
it remains to be seen whether anything can be done to prevent @entity7 taking security of @entity4			1
although @entity61 could yet call an egm which may see @entity199 and @entity200 deposed , that could take up to 42 days to stage			0
in theory , the board could solve the cash crisis with a combination of @entity7 ’s money and some of the £ 5m tabled by the @entity0			2
but the @entity207 ’ insistence on having two places – most likely at the expense of @entity210 and @entity200 makes that seem highly unlikely			0
last night , @entity213 owner @entity212 , whose £ 3m rescue package was rejected in favour of @entity7 ’s , called on him to allay fans ’ fears by publicly stating his intentions for @entity4			1
‘ we ’ve got to be rational , ’ he said			0
‘ it ’s very easy to take a kick at @entity7 but the bottom line here is that , if the club does n’t get funds immediately , it will go into administration			2
‘ i can understand why @entity7 ’s offer is secured against @entity4 because i wanted to do the same thing when i offered the club money in november			1
‘ the key difference was my offer was conditional upon @entity4 being placed in a trust			0
‘ if @entity7 was prepared to make such a pledge perhaps there would not be such feelings of anxiety and hysteria among the @entity2 fans			2
they are being treated with absolute contempt			0

@entity7 plans to use @entity4 and and @entity34 training complex as security on £ 10m loan
the @entity18 owner has already loaned £ 3m to the *troubled* @entity43 club
news of the development was met with widespread anger by fans groups
