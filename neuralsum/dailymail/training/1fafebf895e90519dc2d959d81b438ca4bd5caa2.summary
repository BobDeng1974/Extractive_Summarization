by @entity1 reporter published : 06:08 est , 7 november 2013 @entity3 : 10:33 est , 7 november 2013 fears have been raised that the houses of @entity6 have been infested with a breed ' mutant ' rats which are becoming immune to traditional poisons			2
up to £ 6,000 a month is being spent on pest control at @entity12 , according to figures released in response to a @entity16 request			1
the amount being spent on tackling pests at the @entity19 has risen 15 per cent in the last two years			1
concerns have been raised that the number of rats resistant to poison is on the rise at the houses of @entity6 according to the @entity30 , while officials have attempted to play down any concern of an increase in the recently publicised ' mutant rats ' , one source told the paper : ' you can see from the pest control figures that this is a mounting problem			1
' experts have warned the rats are on the increase across parts of the country after building up a resistance to normal toxic pellets and powders			1
conservative mp sir @entity42 , a member of the @entity43 , told @entity44 he was not aware of mutant rats at the @entity12 but said there was a ' constant battle ' against rodents			1
he said : ' it is an old building and it is on the river and like all buildings on the river and old buildings we have a constant battle			0
' all sorts of techniques are used to deal with this , right through to using a kestrel , but i do n't know about the so - called mutant rats			1
' according to @entity64 , scientists at the @entity63 found three in four of a group of rats they tested were resistant to the poisons			2
up to £ 6,000 a month is being spent at @entity12 on pest control , a rise of 15 per cent in two years , according to reports scientists have warned that in parts of southern @entity73 , up to 70 per cent of rats could be resistant to poisons			1
@entity75 , the @entity76 's technical manager , told @entity44 that ' cases of resistance in rats have been known for decades '			2
he said : ' while the studies show that the resistant rat population is spreading , you can be assured our members have the skills and products to solve this problem			2
' the resistant rats have the ability to multiply rapidly as the gestation period of rats is around 22 days and they reach sexual maturity by eight to 12 weeks			0
experts have warned the ' mutant ' rats are on the increase across parts of the country after building up a resistance to normal toxic pellets and powders mr @entity75 said : ' normal rats are being killed off by poison , so these resistant species are taking their place - it ’s only natural that their numbers are expanding			1
' in december last year @entity44 reported how @entity108 was asking the @entity109 to change rules on how poison is used in a bid to tackle a plage of ' super rats ' that were resistant to conventional poisons			0
homes in @entity118 , @entity119 and @entity120 had reported increased numbers of the ‘ super-rodent ’ which is resistant to normal poisons and can transmit life - threatening diseases to humans and farm animals			0
but wildlife experts feared that if stronger poisons were allowed to be used against the rat - threat it may harm innocent local wildlife			0
@entity132 , from @entity133 in @entity134 , who is contracted by @entity108 , said : ‘ it ’s becoming more of an issue now simply because of the number of rats that are being seen			0
‘ they ’ve also mutated genetically and are bred to be immune to standard poisons			0
‘ we have to start using different methods such as trapping and gassing , which can be less effective and more costly			0
