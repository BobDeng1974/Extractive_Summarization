prominent @entity3 barrister @entity29 said : ' there has not been an incursion such as this since the mid- 1960s when @entity33 ruled @entity1			1
' the current situation is very similar to that recently involving the @entity36 where an unpopular government in @entity38 has seen a territorial dispute as the best way to bury bad news at home			2
' however , the major difference is that @entity1 is supposed to be an ally within @entity45 and a partner in the @entity47			2
@entity48 , @entity49 for the @entity50 and @entity3 , urged the government to draw a line in the sand following the latest incursion ' @entity3 remains staunchly @entity6 and loyal but the worry among many people here is that unless @entity59 becomes more active in protecting its interests , matters will soon escalate into an armed incident			1
' all vessels have the right to innocent passage across @entity6 waters but they can not stop without good reason and they can not patrol the waters as if they belong to them			0
” the warship tornado is a 94 - metre - long vessel which dwarfs both the @entity2 ’s light craft based at @entity3			1

however , it is unprecedented in modern times for such a large military vessel to assert itself off the @entity3 coast			1
