a study published in the @entity1 found that ' consumers who use products to boost their sense of self - worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings ' hitting the shops after heartbreak or not getting a promotion does not make you happy and even backfires by making you think more about your failures , a new study warned retail therapy is thought to make you feel better when you treat yourself to that luxury watch or bag that you have always coveted when faced with a disappointment			1
but in fact you are more likely to dwell on your problems than others			2
researchers found consumers who buy luxury products after a personal failure are simply masking the issue rather than recovering			2
the study by @entity26 of the @entity27 , @entity28 of @entity29 , @entity30 of @entity31 , and @entity32 of @entity33 showed shoppers who buy to boost their self - worth could actually feel worse			1
they said : “ when consumers experience a psychological threat to how they would like to see themselves , buying products that signal accomplishment in the same area of their life could ironically cause them to dwell on their shortcomings			0
“ this can strip consumers of their mental resources and impair their self - control			1
” the study invited participants to recall a time when their intelligence was undermined and what they did about it			0
results showed that those who opted for a form of retail therapy were unhappier in the longer term			0
the researchers concluded : “ consumption can sometimes compensate for our blunders and failures , but this does n’t always work			0
“ consumers who use products to boost their sense of self - worth tend to dwell on their shortcomings and their ability to exert self - control is impaired			1
“ after experiencing a setback in one area of their life , consumers might be better off boosting their sense of self in a different area of their life			0
“ for example , a consumer whose intelligence is undermined might be better off signalling their self - worth socially rather than trying to assert their intelligence			2
” the study was published in the @entity1			0
although you might think retail therapy will have you feeling great ( left ) a new study from researchers at @entity27 , @entity29 and @entity31 has found it can actually negatively impact your mental resources and self - control ( right )			1

treating yourself makes it likelier you will dwell on problems , study finds
boosting self - worth with products can affect ' ability to exert self - control '
study was *conducted* by researchers from @entity31 and others
