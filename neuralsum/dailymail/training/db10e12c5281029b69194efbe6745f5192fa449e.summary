the boss of @entity1 has announced a radical plan to make the trains run on time - fast - track more women recruits			1
chief executive @entity6 has declared war on the ' macho - culture ' of the rail industry and unveiled a blueprint to more than double to one in 3 , the proportion of female staff employed by his firm which runs the nations rail tracks			1
at the current recruitment rates that would take 65 years			0
so radical action is needed now , he said			0
the culture change was necessary to address the chronic failures and ' institutional incompetence ' of the recent past , for which he apologised			1
@entity6 , the boss of @entity1 , has declared war on the ' macho - culture ' of the rail industry he said the vital woman 's touch was needed to rid the railways of a reputation for ' stale sandwiches , leaves on the line , and the wrong kind of snow ' , to show a more caring face to passengers , and to end @entity1 's own image as ' the company that people love to hate '			1
the former oil industry boss who was once responsible for @entity42 's @entity41 fields , told rail industry chiefs he had seen first - hand the degree to which more women employees had ' transformed ' the macho culture there and wanted to repeat the lesson on the railways			1
but it prompted one former @entity52 to describe mr @entity6 's frank appraisal - following the @entity55 chaos at @entity56 and @entity57 - as ' a systematic hatchet job ' of the current @entity1 culture			1
currently just one in seven of @entity1 's 35,000 staff – or around 5,000 employees in total – are women			2
but he want to increase that to around one in three – from trackside engineers to office support staff			0
mr @entity6 said : ' today women make up only 14 per cent of the @entity1 workforce			1
it is hardly surprising that under such circumstances we still have what many would describe as a macho - culture within the company			1
' currently just one in seven of @entity1 's 35,000 staff – or around 5,000 employees in total – are women he added : ' and to make matters worse , at the current rate that the numbers of women in our business are increasing , it will take another 65 years before we reach 30 per cent – a level which is seen as a tipping point for organisations looking to benefit from gender diversity			2
' he was a strong advocate of ' positive action ' to recruit and promote more women but stressed : ' this is not the same as positive discrimination , but it does recognise that if you do not take some action to compensate for the inherent biases that must exist , the bad habits that have persisted in the past will carry on in the future			2
' he said any woman with the necessary qualifications for a job will in future be automatically offered an interview for it			0
but only the best candidate – regardless of gender – would be recruited , he insisted			0
more women would also help reduce the ' appalling tragedies ' and 600 serious injuries on the railways each year because female employees were less ' macho ' , he said : ' when women started becoming a much more visible presence on the oil and gas platforms in the @entity41 twenty years ago , the difference they brought was profound			2
' the extreme macho , and frankly unsafe , culture that was a hallmark of the industry in the 1970s and 1980s changed dramatically and forever			2
' mr @entity6 said : ' diversity and inclusion are n't just nice - to - haves			1
it 's not political correctness			0
they are powerful tools to help any organisation improve its performance			0
' he said @entity1 had to get back to basics noting : ' too often we have allowed the basics to be forgotten as we divert the organisation onto yet another fad or initiative			2
' mr @entity6 , who has waived a bonus and reduced the amount that directors can earn above their basic salary , attacked the bonus culture and the previous ' incomprehensible ' company incentive scheme which he said has now been reformed			1
he noted : ' sometimes we let passengers down			0
i do n't think that 's acceptable or just a fact of life			0
and i understand their frustration and their anger			0
' ' reputations are hard won and easily lost			0
anecdotes can quickly become a short - cut to characterise more general institutional incompetence			1
' stale sandwiches , leaves on the line , the wrong kind of snow			0
these have entered the lexicon of public conversations about the railway over the last 30 years			0
' the railway 's poor reputation left staff ' being ridiculed by friends and family			1
' he added : ' if we are to stop being the company that people love to hate , the public needs to see a high performing organisation , but crucially one that demonstrably cares about passengers			0
' former labour transport secretary @entity175 who compered the event at the @entity177 in @entity178 said mr @entity6 's speech smacked of ' a systematic hatchet job ' of the current @entity1 culture adding : ' i do n't think i 've ever heard a ceo be so critical of his own company			1
