by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity2 has urged @entity3 to make @entity4 progress a higher priority than four domestic league crowns in a row			1
a key figure in the last @entity11 side to reach a @entity13 final in 2003 , @entity8 claimed the champions can afford to drop points in the @entity16 – and still win the title			1
rating @entity20 ’s second - tier competition as a chance to re-energise a season which has already witnessed two demoralising exits from the @entity24 , however , the @entity18 suggested his former club could go all the way and actually win the trophy			1
@entity2 played for @entity3 between 2000 - 2006 , and believes the club should prioritise the @entity4 @entity30 's side have endured a torrid start , but ended a four - straight run of defeats on saturday ‘ @entity3 , for me , should prioritise this @entity4 campaign , ’ said @entity8 , as he promoted @entity35 ’s live coverage of the opening game in @entity37 on thursday night			1
‘ they can afford to drop points in the league , lose games and still win the league because they are far and away the best team in @entity44			1
‘ they would get a real shot in the arm from performing well in this competition			2
the @entity4 has a totally new dimension now with the winners going straight into the @entity24			2
why ca n’t it be @entity3 ? @entity30 joined @entity3 in june , but has not had an easy start to life in @entity54 @entity3 crashed out of the @entity24 after losing at home to @entity56 on 26 august ‘ things change quickly in football			1
there is a bit of doom and gloom about the @entity24 but that ’s gone now			2
@entity3 could win the treble and could go on a good run in the @entity4 and go on and win it			1
‘ they have top players like @entity67 and @entity68 coming back and players who can grow			0
@entity3 have good raw attributes – they just need to pull it all together			1
’ @entity8 has been sceptical of the systems employed by coach @entity30 in a stuttering start to the season delivering just five wins in 11 competitive games			1
but heartened by the additions of @entity77 , @entity78 and @entity79 - with @entity80 only eligible for the knockout stages – @entity8 believes @entity3 now have the pace to make an impact			1
@entity2 ( right ) has experienced @entity13 success with @entity3 , pictured scoring against @entity85 in 2003 @entity67 celebrates his goal against @entity87 on saturday , which helped @entity3 end a win-less spell ‘ there are things i have n’t understood about the @entity4 and the mentality of clubs in @entity18			1
they play the youth team and get knocked out			0
it does n’t make any sense to me			0
‘ i think @entity3 should really go for this campaign because they have everything to gain			2
‘ the first two games in this group stage are absolutely crucial			0
@entity37 have lost their last three , but that ’s dangerous going into this because they have chucked a lot of money at their side and we all might think @entity3 should go there and win , but it does n’t work like that			1
‘ that might work against @entity3			2
but they can go there with confidence			0
the main thing is : “ do n’t lose the game			0
” ’ @entity117 ( right ) gave @entity3 a scare when his goal for @entity120 sparked a spirited fightback on saturday @entity3 captain @entity68 and @entity35 pundit @entity2 at @entity3 's training ground on tuesday @entity8 also cautioned against making snap judgements following an accusation by @entity87 ’s @entity125 that @entity3 winger @entity79 aimed racist comments towards him during last saturday ’s game at @entity11			1
‘ there is n’t any place for abuse of any level			0
it is up to the @entity44 to investigate it , ’ said @entity8			2
‘ we ’ve all been abused over the years and i am not saying it is right , but you get on with the game			0
‘ it is unsavoury but the @entity44 have to get to the bottom of it			0
you ca n’t hang @entity79 yet because if it is proved he did n’t say it , then he did n’t say it			0
it ’s jumping the gun a little bit			0
people jump to conclusions pretty quickly			0
’ @entity87 confirmed yesterday that they have been asked for their version of events by the @entity44 as the governing body ’s enquiries continue			0
a statement read : ‘ the club will co-operate fully with this investigation			0
as an employer we support unconditionally any employee who is the subject of any form of abuse and as such believe it is appropriate to allow the @entity44 the time necessary to carry out a full investigation			0
’ @entity3 have already issued a denial on behalf of @entity165 international @entity79			2
