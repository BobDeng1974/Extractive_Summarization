it 's not often that a king comes face - to - face with an emperor but that is exactly what happened when the @entity7 's @entity6 was welcomed to @entity8 by the country 's @entity9			1
the @entity7 royals are beginning a six - day tour of the country , and were greeted by an honour guard as they arrived in the @entity8 capital			1
after a visit to a design museum and a gorgeous oriental garden , the two finished their first day with a lavish state banquet thrown in their honour			0
also on hand to welcome the @entity7 monarch and his wife was @entity45 , 80 , who , when she married emperor @entity9 on the 10th april 1959 , became the first commoner ever to marry into the @entity8 royal family			1
after exchanging handshakes on the red carpet , @entity9 , 80 , joined his @entity7 counterparts for a flag raising ceremony and official public welcome			2
glowing : the @entity7 royal appeared to be in good spirits during the evening bejeweled : @entity23 commanded most of the attention at the dinner - courtesy of a glittering gold gown later , the @entity7 couple were taken to visit a design museum , with @entity23 , ever the fashion fan , proving particularly interested in the style offerings on show			1
an exhausting day then ended with a sumptuous state banquet , which saw the couple arrive in full royal regalia for their dinner with the @entity46 couple at the @entity46			0
warm : the two couples exchanged kisses as they were introduced to one another ceremony : the two couples then took part in an official welcome ceremony which saw both flags raised making an entrance : @entity23 , 43 , was glamorous in a patriotic orange silk dress and hat formal : @entity6 looked sombre as he walked with emperor @entity9 during the ceremony big event : the @entity7 royal couple are beginning a six - day tour of the @entity97 nation solemn : although sombre during the ceremony , @entity23 and @entity45 appeared to enjoy each other 's company @entity8 boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world , beginning with @entity104 who reigned from 660 bc. since then , 125 emperors have come and gone , with the most recent , @entity106 , famous for being head of state during the @entity108			1
unlike other members of the @entity8 administration , he was not charged with war crimes and instead oversaw @entity8 's rebirth as a constitutional monarchy - a process continued by his son , @entity9			2
unlike their @entity8 counterparts , who have sat on the @entity119 since 1990 following the death of @entity106 , the @entity7 royals are among the newest - and youngest - monarchs in the world			1
@entity6 , 47 , was one of the beneficiaries of a spate of abdications in 2013 which saw his mother @entity126 step down along with @entity127 of @entity128 and pope @entity129			0
only @entity130 and @entity131 of @entity132 have been on the throne for a shorter period of time , with the two crowned in june following the abdication of @entity137			0
but while @entity140 and @entity130 's reign has so far gone smoothly , @entity23 and her husband have had a rougher ride in recent months thanks in part to the @entity145 tragedy , which left the @entity7 reeling			2
nevertheless , since the crash , the popularity of the @entity148 - born @entity7 queen has soared thanks to her tireless work on behalf of the @entity145 families			0
she has also attended some of the repatriation ceremonies and was seen sobbing from her perch beside prime minister @entity155 as the first flight arrived back on @entity7 soil			0

with her husband , she also enjoyed a successful trip to @entity192 last month , where she was seen chatting with fellow queen @entity140 during a meeting of the @entity194			0
the pair were reiunited for the second time in a month two weeks ago , when the @entity132 royals paid their @entity7 counterparts a friendly visit in the @entity179			0
entertaining : the couple appeared to enjoy their time at the museum , @entity23 in particular what 's this ? the pair look baffled as they inspect a series of jars containing a mysterious - looking substance curious : maxima looked slightly horrified as the jars contents were explained to her by museum guides beautiful : after the visit to the museum , the couple enjoyed a quiet walk around its pretty garden quiet : @entity23 , who was clutching a bouquet , and @entity6 made their exit across a bridge			2
