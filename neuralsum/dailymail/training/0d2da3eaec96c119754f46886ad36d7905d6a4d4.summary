dogs only migrated to the @entity6 10,000 years ago , thousands of years after the first human migrants crossed a land bridge from @entity3 to @entity4 , researchers have found			1
the biggest analysis so far of ancient dogs in the @entity6 looked at the genetic characteristics of 84 individual dogs from more than a dozen sites in @entity6 researchers say studying our canine companions could even help explain human migration around the world - as they faithfully follow			1
use the interactive map below to see how dogs arrived in the @entity6 the @entity19 site is located near the ancient city @entity21 ( below ) , the largest and first known metropolitan area in @entity4			1
occupation of the @entity19 site occurred between 1,400 and 1,000 years ago , the researchers said , while @entity21 was active from about 1,000 to 700 years ago			1
dozens of dogs were ceremonially buried at @entity19 , suggesting that people there had a special reverence for dogs			1
while most of the dogs were buried individually , some were placed back - to - back in pairs			0
the findings appear in the @entity35			0
unlike their wild wolf predecessors , ancient dogs learned to tolerate human company and generally benefited from the association : they gained access to new food sources , enjoyed the safety of human encampments and , eventually , traveled the world with their two - legged masters			2
dogs also were pressed into service as beasts of burden , and sometimes were served as food , particularly on special occasions			0
their 11,000 - to 16,000 - year association with humans makes dogs a promising subject for the study of ancient human behavior , including migratory behavior , said @entity63 graduate student @entity62 , who led the new analysis with anthropology professor @entity66			2
' dogs are one of the earliest organisms to have migrated with humans to every continent , and i think that says a lot about the relationship dogs have had with humans , ' @entity62 said			1
' they can be a powerful tool when you 're looking at how human populations have moved around over time			0
' human remains are not always available for study ' because living populations who are very connected to their ancestors in some cases may be opposed to the destructive nature of genetic analysis , ' @entity62 said			0
analysis of ancient dog remains is often permitted when analysis of human remains is not , she said			2
previous studies of ancient dogs in the @entity6 focused on the dogs ' mitochondrial dna , which is easier to obtain from ancient remains than nuclear dna and , unlike nuclear dna , is inherited only from the mother			1
this means mitochondrial dna offers researchers ' an unbroken line of inheritance back to the past , ' @entity62 said			0
the new study also focused on mitochondrial dna , but included a much larger sample of dogs than had been analyzed before			0
molecular anthropologist @entity108 of @entity109 provided new dna samples from ancient dog remains found in @entity111 and @entity112 , and the @entity113 ( @entity114 ) provided 35 samples from a site in southern @entity117 known as @entity19 , near present - day @entity118			1

while most of the dogs were buried individually , some were placed back - to - back in pairs			0
in @entity21 , dog remains , sometimes burned , are occasionally found with food debris , suggesting that dogs were present and sometimes were consumed			2
dog burials during this time period are uncommon			0

while most of the dogs were buried individually , some were placed back - to - back in pairs			0
as previous studies had done , the @entity117 team analyzed genetic signals of diversity and relatedness in a special region ( the hypervariable region ) of the mitochondrial genome of ancient dogs from the @entity6			1
the researchers found four never - before - seen genetic signatures in the new samples , suggesting greater ancient dog diversity in the @entity6 than previously thought			1
they also found unusually low genetic diversity in some dog populations , suggesting that humans in those regions may have engaged in dog breeding			2
in some samples , the team found significant genetic similarities with @entity172 wolves , indicating that some of the dogs interbred with or were domesticated anew from @entity172 wolves			0
but the most surprising finding had to do with the dogs ' arrival in the @entity6 , @entity62 said			0
' dog genetic diversity in the @entity6 may date back to only about 10,000 years ago , ' she said			2
' this also is about the same time as the oldest dog burial found in the @entity6 , ' @entity66 said			0
' this may not be a coincidence			0
' the current study , of only a small part of the mitochondrial genome , likely provides an incomplete picture of ancient dog diversity in the @entity6 , @entity66 said			1
' the region of the mitochondrial genome sequenced may mask the true genetic diversity of indigenous dogs in the @entity6 , resulting in the younger date for dogs when compared with humans , ' he said			2
more studies of ancient dogs are in the works , the researchers said			2
@entity62 has already sequenced the full mitochondrial genomes of 20 ancient dogs , and more are planned to test this possibility , the researchers said			0
many researchers believe the earliest dogs in the @entity6 were similar to the @entity204 ( pictured )			0
