@entity5 , 16 , was visiting a friend 's house in @entity8 , @entity9 , when she was attacked by the animal - a @entity12 @entity11 crossed with a rottweiler			1
she said : ' when we got to the house i sat on one of the chairs in the living room but my friend and her grandma told me to move because that was the dog 's chair			2
warning graphic content vicious : the terrifying attack left 16 - year - old @entity5 with horrendous facial injuries ' the dog started licking my face , and it made me feel uncomfortable so i tried to move away , but as i moved it attacked			1
' the next thing i knew i was outside the house with blood gushing from my face			2
my nose and lip were hanging off and i could hardly see			1
' @entity5 was rushed to hospital and has undergone two operations and required more than 100 stitches to repair her injuries			1
the dog attacked her so viciously her tear duct was torn out , her cheekbone was fractured , her nose ripped out of place and her lips torn to shreds			1
@entity5 added : ' my cheekbone will always be fractured - they ca n't fix that unless i have major surgery			1
' because my tear ducts were ripped out i have to have a glass tube inside my eye that filters my tears			1
the doctors had to sew my nose back on and sew my lips back together , and i 've got a really deep scar on my face			2
it still has n't healed , 18 months later			0
' @entity5 and her parents contacted the police , but were shocked to discover no action could be taken against the owners of the dog because the incident happened on private property			1
it is understood the dog was put down following the attack in august 2011			0
@entity5 is now urging the government to go ahead with plans for a change in the law			1
last month , 14 - year - old @entity72 was mauled to death by a pack of dogs at a house in @entity77 , @entity78			0
still recovering : @entity5 says she still feels nervous about going out in public following the horrific attack the dog was a cross-breed between a @entity12 @entity11 , pictured , and a @entity83 the dog , a cross between a rottweiler , pictured , and @entity87 was put down after the attack @entity89 , who are investigating @entity72 's death , have said it is ' unlikely ' anyone will be prosecuted over @entity72 's death			1
they are unable to take action because the dogs involved were not banned breeds and under current laws dog owners can not be prosecuted if attacks take place on private property			1
but @entity72 's family have launched an e-petition calling for a change to the law and her death has prompted mps to call for urgent reform of dog control laws			0
in february , the government announced it would amend legislation so dog owners could be prosecuted if their animal attacks someone on private property			1
eighteen months after the attack , @entity5 says she has been left so traumatised she is scared to go out in public and constantly feels like she 's being judged			2
angry : @entity5 has spoken out as the government is trying to pass new laws regarding dog attacks she said : ' it 's affected me in so many ways			2
i 've become anxious around dogs , dog lovers and people i do n't know			0
' even walking in public with no makeup on is a demanding task , i ca n't bring myself to do it			0
' i dread sleeping at night in fear of having nightmares			0
' i find it difficult to have relationships because i think the constant reminders and moods i go in over the intrusive thoughts will destroy them			0
' my old friend and her family have blamed me and said it 's my own fault because i was told it was the dog 's chair , but it was a sofa , i did n't see anything wrong in sitting down			0
' the family have not shown any remorse - i still see them near my home and they act like nothing has happened			2
' that 's why the government needs to carry on trying to change the law on this			0
' i fully support it , and knowing other people think they should be prosecuted has given me the confidence to speak out			0
' it ' [ s happening too often now , and the attack on me and other attacks on young girls in the news show it can happen to people of any age			0
' i will fight until the day i die for justice for people in the same boat as me			0
