exactly a century after it became the first ship to be sunk by a @entity3 torpedo , the @entity0 has been marked with a wreath at its underwater resting place			1
divers swum 220 feet ( 68 metres ) down off @entity8 's east coast to commemorate the anniversary - filming the touching event on a @entity11 camera			1
they made their way through the murky waters off @entity14 , before coming across the rusted remains of the once great warship			1
@entity29 went on to become one of the @entity32 ' most successful u-boat commanders , earning himself the nickname ' @entity34 der @entity35 ' - or ' destroyer of @entity37 '			2
captain @entity38 laying a wreath on behalf of the @entity20 and @entity40 lost on @entity0 the @entity20 and @entity40 remember @entity0 from onboard @entity41 the @entity43 patrol boat @entity45 meeting @entity46 there were just 18 known survivors - including the captain - lieutenant commander @entity49 , who escaped wounded			1
lieutenant @entity50 ( then @entity51 ) also survived the sinking , and recounted : ' the ship gave a heavy lurch forward and took an angle of about forty degrees down by the bow			1
' @entity57 came swirling up to the searchlight platform			2
' the captain said : " jump you devils jump ! " ' the captain and his secretary remained with the ship until the very end but somehow both survived ' the @entity68 family , who laid a plaque over the wreck site to remember @entity68 - a stoker on board @entity68 , who died on board ( left ) and a plaque made to commemorate his death the ship was struck on the starboard side under the bridge from 1,500 yards ( 1,372 metres ) while patrolling waters off southern @entity8			1
the forward magazine exploded , the bows were blown off and it sank in around four minutes			2
author @entity82 , who wrote the @entity84 classic ' @entity85 ' , actually witnessed the moment the ship was struck			1
he said in a letter to his father : ' there was not a piece of wood , they said , big enough to float a man - and over acres the sea was covered with fragments - human and otherwise			2
' they brought back a sailor 's cap with half a man 's head inside it			1
' the wreath was presented to the team of @entity105 divers by @entity106 - a 74 - year - old from @entity108 who lost his uncle in the disaster			1
a portrait of @entity32 commander @entity112 , who sunk the ship from the u-boat ( furthest right ) @entity117 never met his nephew , as he was just 19 when he was killed on board the ship , but mr @entity106 was especially keen to honour him , as his body was never recovered and he has no grave			1
because of difficulty travelling , his grandparents were unable to make it up to @entity8 to remember their son , so when he heard about the commemorative dive he requested that the wreath be placed			1
a plaque was also laid over the wreckage site by the @entity68 family , to remember @entity68 - a stoker who died on board the @entity0			1
despite the sinking being plainly visible from the shore , @entity135 authorities tried to cover it up , and claimed the ship was destroyed by a mine			1
however , @entity141 published the report of a fisherman who helped with the rescue , revealing the truth that the boat was shot down			1
the @entity0 was a 385 - foot ( 117 - metre ) long @entity148 scout cruiser			2
it had a top speed of 25 knots and had 15 guns and two torpedo tubes			2
the @entity32 ran the u-boat campaign throughout @entity24 , and used the submarines to attack the @entity156 ' trade routes			0
they mostly attacked around @entity135 and the @entity157 , and destroyed almost 5,000 ships in total			0
the campaign started in the @entity161 , when 10 submarines were sent from @entity163 to attack @entity20 ships			0
however , it was unsuccessful - only one torpedo was fired and it missed its intended target - @entity167			0
meanwhile , two of the u-boats were lost			0
the u-boats had much more success when their attentions were turned to the war on commerce			0
@entity135 had already managed to block off @entity32 with its @entity20 , not even allowing food to enter the country , and since the @entity32 ' main navy was much weaker than the @entity135 , they fought back using u-boats			0
admiral @entity178 , commander of the @entity179 , declared the @entity135 and @entity181 seas a war zone , and the @entity32 send out 20 boats to form a naval blockade			0
they sunk a huge amount of trade boats heading into @entity135			0
in 1917 , the @entity32 came up with the tactic of trying to 600,000 tons of shipping heading into @entity135 each month - they believed this would force their enemies to try for peace within six months			0
this was a huge success - 860,000 tons were sunk in april of that year alone , the @entity135 were left with just six weeks - worth of wheat , and the @entity195 were forced to declare war			0
towards the end of the war , the @entity156 had become far better at countering the threat of u-boats			0
they used planes to patrol the seas - forcing them to go below the surface , where they were blind			1
the @entity204 then followed - when 70,000 mines were lain and destroyed six u-boats between september and november 1918			0
upon the @entity32 surrender , the @entity156 insisted all u-boats were also surrendered to them			0
their last act was to suppress the @entity32 naval mutiny in october 1918 - revolt by sailors of the @entity179			0
in total , u-boats sunk almost 13 million gross tons of @entity156 ' shipping			0
of the 351 boats , 178 were lost in combat , with 5,000 people killed on board them .			2
