@entity0 believes that next season 's @entity2 title race will be even more open - and admits his @entity5 side could finish anywhere from being champions to finishing sixth			1
and having already signed @entity8 from @entity9 - with @entity11 striker @entity10 expected to be next to head to @entity12 - @entity0 has admitted he still needs to ' rebuild ' @entity5 , hinting that more changes could be on the way			1
speaking to @entity5 's website , the @entity16 coach reflected on his first season back in @entity19 that saw @entity5 finish third behind @entity20 and @entity21 - and said that @entity5 will be ' better ' next season , before admitting that their title rivals may also improve			1
but he says that in the 2014/15 campaign , the @entity35 want to finish top of the pile			2
' next season will be very , very difficult , even more so , ' he said.Ã‚ transition : @entity41 and @entity42 are among those that will be leaving @entity12 this summer new boys : but @entity8 has been brought in and @entity10 looks set to follow him to lead the line @entity5 anxious for @entity10 deal ' i know @entity5 will be better , but maybe the other teams will be better too , so it will again be the kind of league where you do n't know if you 're going to finish first or finish sixth			1
in this moment i have to think and feel and say we want to finish first			2
' i enjoy this club , i like the club , and i like the league			0
i love the way people live football in this country			0
i was a little part of the process that made @entity5 a force in the last decade , and i come back with the dream to try to be a little part again of the next decade			2
' competition : @entity68 rival : @entity70 new kid : @entity72 but the self - proclaimed ' special one ' also conceded that his @entity5 side are still in transition			2
' after 10 years of titles and great moments , this is a moment to rebuild again , because teams do n't last for ever			1
clubs yes , but not the teams			0
in the same club you have to build another team			0
' and @entity0 reserved some special praise for @entity84 from last campaign , recognising the @entity88 playmaker 's contribution after criticising his work rate after @entity5 's @entity91 semi final exit against @entity92			1
@entity93 staying put under pressure : @entity0 failed to win a trophy in his first season back at @entity5 but will want to change that hazard warning : @entity5 's new no 10 is on international duty but @entity0 praised his contribution last season ' i understand this beauty and these magic moments he brings to the game are what the fans enjoy the most , ' he assessed			1
' people like @entity110 bring the magic and win matches in one action			0
they have the flair and the artist 's touch of the football			0
' he had a big evolution and he scored more goals than before			0
his work - rate for the team improved a lot too			0
[ he will have ] more appetite for the next season to be even better			0
' final puzzle piece : @entity0 has longed for a striker of @entity10 's calibre and looks to have secured him @entity5 complete @entity8 transfer			1

@entity5 manager expects @entity84 to become ' even better ' this year
but he says with other teams improving @entity5 could finish anywhere
' this is a moment to rebuild again , ' @entity0 says
