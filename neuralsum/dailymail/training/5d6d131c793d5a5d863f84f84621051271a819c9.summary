@entity0 fears @entity1 will be ruled out until the @entity2 , leaving @entity3 to consider a late plunge into the transfer market before monday ’s deadline			1
@entity0 tried to push concerns aside to avoid distractions ahead of wednesday ’s @entity9 play - off second leg against @entity11 but admitted @entity1 could face a long time out after a freak injury			1
the striker was hurt when the ball smashed into the sole of his boot in the final seconds of saturday ’s 2 - 2 draw at @entity19 , pushing the toe - end of the foot upwards towards the shin , causing a small fracture near his ankle			1
‘ the problem i think is his tibia			2
he over-stretched his ankle that way			2
it was on the ball , not a contact			2
‘ he has had a medical check but we need to have further investigation			0
the first news is not fantastic but i am not a doctor			0
so i wait for the complete examination and decision for how long he will be out			0
’ @entity1 will be assessed again by a specialist on wednesday but when asked if it looked like a long - term injury , @entity0 replied : ‘ it can be , we ’ll see			1
it ’s sad for us , but for the moment we are focused on this game			0
we have started the season quite well , with three good games			0
we want to continue to grow and win our games			0
’ @entity3 are also without captain @entity57 , who twisted an ankle in the goalless first leg and influential midfielder @entity60 , who is banned after a red card in @entity63			1
@entity64 has a hamstring problem and @entity66 , out since january with a knee injury , will not be rushed back , with both set to return after next month ’s international break			1
@entity70 man ? summer signing @entity71 is an option for @entity0 up front against @entity11 option : @entity76 is a more natural forward , but there are still reservations over his consistency and ability transfer : @entity82 seemed in high spirits despite speculation linking him with a move away @entity3 ’s poor injury record has been criticised in the past but @entity0 said : ‘ we do not have any muscular problems apart from @entity64			1
overall that is quite good compared to other clubs			0
the other injuries are @entity57 with an ankle problem and @entity1			1
you can not plan for an injury like his in the 94th minute			2
’ the prospect of five months out for @entity1 forces @entity0 to contemplate an emergency dip into the market , even though it is something which goes against the grain for the @entity3 boss			1
‘ in @entity99 as soon as you have a problem people want you to buy , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ i can give you clubs with plenty of players who every time they lose say they have to buy more			0
but if you give the number of strikers we have it is unbelievable			0
’ @entity0 can choose between @entity76 , @entity110 , @entity82 and @entity71 to lead the line against @entity11			1
@entity71 is the favourite , despite failing to impress at @entity113			2
stalemate : @entity3 were held to a 0 - 0 draw against @entity118 side @entity11 in the first leg last week ‘ you do not convict a player on one half , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ it was not all bad			0
there was some quality in what he did			0
i just felt , on the day , we needed some more physical presence			0
’ @entity3 are attempting to reach the group stages of the @entity9 for the 17th successive year			1
they have won their last six of these play - off ties without ever seeming in danger			1
defeat at this stage would cost the @entity135 an estimated £ 25million and , despite healthy cash reserves , it would not help the club buy a top - quality replacement for @entity1			1
‘ it will affect us because we will have less income , ’ said @entity0			2
‘ but it will not affect our balance sheet in a dramatic way			0
we can survive without that			0
we want to be in the @entity9 , we want to play top - level football			1
‘ financially we have always adapted			0
when we had very small resources , we adapted to very small resources			0
we want to play at the top			2
’ in charge : @entity0 gathers his troops ahead of @entity3 's tuesday morning training session			1

@entity3 face @entity11 on wednesday in @entity9 play - off second leg at the @entity156 after 0 - 0 draw in @entity118 last week
captain @entity57 is injured and @entity60 is *suspended*
@entity1 suffered an ankle injury during 2 - 2 draw with @entity19
@entity163 , who scored in the draw , set to be ruled out for five months
@entity0 could be forced back into the transfer market to find a striker
@entity71 , @entity76 or @entity110 could fill the void up front
@entity82 is also an option , but @entity174 @entity173 winner has been linked with a loan move to @entity176
