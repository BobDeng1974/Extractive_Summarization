by @entity1 reporter published : 20:55 est , 11 september 2012 updated : 20:55 est , 11 september 2012 many city dwellers have resigned themselves to the fact that living in close proximity to pet owners means sharing the sidewalks with their four - legged friends			0
but in @entity9 , @entity10 , authorities are thinking about banning dogs altogether			1
the radical measure , if passed , could ban any canines from walking along a key 10 - block stretch of @entity9 ’ downtown business district			1
no dogs go downtown ? officials in @entity9 , @entity10 are toying with the idea of banning dogs from a 10 - block stretch of the downtown strip the @entity22 reported that officials in @entity9 believe part of the problem is that larger dogs , including pit bulls and @entity27 , sometimes left tied to parking meters by their owners			1
city manager says some of the dogs are ‘ as big as ponies			1
’ another concern is simply that some owners do n't clean up after their dogs			0
one elderly resident nearly tripped over a leashed dog as he tried to make his way down the sidewalk , said city manager @entity40			0
the city is still researching a possible ban and council does n't expect to act on it until later in the year			0
while some residents applaud the move , others say the city should focus on drug crimes and prostitution in the city about 30 miles northwest of @entity52			0
revitalizing : officials say that large dogs that are curbed downtown just congest the sidewalks checkered past : the downtown strip is battling image problems due to drug deals and prostitution many businesses along the stretch of downtown have complained that dogs along the strip are unsanitary , and prevent potential customers from strolling along the storefronts			1
but the paper notes that even if dogs were banned , the downtown section has a checkered past with drugs and prostitution			2
resident @entity73 told the @entity22 that the whole endeavour is a ‘ waste of time , ’ adding that having officers patrolling the streets would be much more effective			2
as it stands , the city is still looking into the parameters on a possible ban , and wo n’t vote on any until later this fall .			0
