a team of scientists has discovered that a giant ' burp ' of carbon dioxide from the @entity4 helped trigger the end of last ice age , around 17,000 years ago			1
the recent study , led by dr @entity8 of the @entity9 in @entity10 , found that changes in ocean circulation in the @entity4 caused a massive outpouring of @entity14			1
this was released from the deep ocean into the atmosphere , helping to warm the planet sufficiently to trigger the end of the ice age			2
a team of scientists has discovered that a giant ' burp ' of carbon dioxide from the @entity4 helped trigger the end of last ice age , around 17,000 years ago ( stock image shown )			1
the recent study was led by dr @entity8 of the @entity9 , @entity10 previously , scientists have suggested that the @entity24 and @entity25 were the only places likely to release @entity14 as a result of glaciers retreating , due to their deep water formation			1
however , a change in rainfall over the @entity4 region caused by the @entity34 monsoon and the westerly storm track made the ocean surface saltier and less buoyant , allowing it to form deep water , say the scientists			2
deep waters form when air temperatures are cold but the salinity of surface water is high , so water becomes denser and sinks lower			0
one example is the @entity44 , which carries salt into high latitudes of the @entity25 where water cools			0
the cooling and the added salt cause the waters to sink in the @entity51			0
this is the formation of @entity53			0
if deep water comes to the surface it will warm and release carbon dioxide , as cold water holds more carbon dioxide than warm water			1
@entity61 this resulted in co2 stored in the deep @entity4 being released into the atmosphere , where it helped warm the planet and melt back the ice sheets that covered much of the @entity68			2
' our study shows that @entity4 deep water penetrated all the way into the deep ocean , allowing it to release deep ocean @entity14 , ' said dr @entity8 , of the @entity76 of @entity77 and @entity78			0
' we tested this idea further with a climate model , which showed that deep water formation in the @entity4 causes ocean @entity14 release , large enough to drive the atmospheric co2 rise recorded at the start of the deglaciation			2
' the results of our study came as a big surprise , as we were expecting to see a signature of @entity14 release from the ocean around @entity92 , which has been the leading hypothesis for deglacial @entity14 rise			0
' instead we found a signal we can only explain with @entity14 release from the @entity4			0
' the researchers warn , however , the man - made activities will warm the climate much faster than this release of @entity14 did			1
' humans have driven @entity14 rise in the atmosphere as large as the @entity14 rise that helped end the last ice age , but the man - made @entity14 rise has happened 100 times faster , ' said dr @entity8 the team of scientists from the @entity9 , @entity112 and @entity113 , @entity109 made a series of chemical measurements on minuscule fossil shells to trace ocean co2 storage and circulation patterns up to two miles ( 3.2 kilometres ) beneath the ocean 's surface			1
' this study is only really possible thanks to new developments in geochemistry , that allow us to reconstruct the @entity126 [ acidity ] of the ocean in the past for the first time , giving an accurate measurement of how ocean @entity14 is stored and released , ' added dr @entity133 , of the @entity134			0
the new findings will help scientists understand how @entity77 's climate can operate , and the different ways in which the ocean and atmosphere can exchange @entity14			0
but dr @entity8 warned : ' although the @entity14 rise caused by this process was dramatic in geological terms , it happened very slowly compared to modern man - made @entity14 rise			1
' humans have driven @entity14 rise in the atmosphere as large as the @entity14 rise that helped end the last ice age , but the man - made @entity14 rise has happened 100 times faster			1
' this will have a huge effect on the climate system , and one that we are only just starting to see			0

scientists have found evidence for a giant release of carbon dioxide
the *international* team was led from the @entity9 , @entity10
a change in rainfall over the @entity4 *unleashed* stored co2
this *ultimately* warmed the planet and brought the ice age to a close
but the researchers warn the event was on a much slower scale then man - made global warming
