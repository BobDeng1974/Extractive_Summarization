@entity1 team boss @entity0 has defended outgoing champion @entity2 after another race in which he again played second fiddle to team - mate @entity5			1
after winning the title for the last four years , @entity2 's reign is almost officially over as he trails championship leader @entity8 by 132 points , with 175 available			2
for the most part it has been a season of struggle for @entity2 , who has far from enjoyed the change in car following the switch at the start of this year to the current 1.6 - litre @entity19 turbo - charged power units			1
feeling the strain : four - times world champion @entity2 has endured a troubled campaign coming through : @entity5 passes his team - mate during the latter stages of sunday 's race during sunday 's @entity26 @entity25 , @entity5 produced another fine drive to finish fifth following a shocking start , dropping several places after lining up ninth on the grid			1
following his only pit stop , @entity5 conjured a number of stunning overtaking moves on @entity36 's @entity35 , the mclarens of @entity38 and @entity39 , @entity41 's @entity40 , and finally @entity2			2
the 27 - year - old @entity42 now faces the ignominious prospect of being beaten by a team - mate for the first time in his @entity47 career			1
despite that , a protective @entity0 said : ' it 's been a difficult year for @entity50 , but that 's not been of his own making			1
' @entity5 has driven incredibly well , and all credit should be given to him for how he has driven this year			0
on the move : @entity2 finished sixth behind @entity5 in @entity55			1
he is 60 points behind the @entity57 ' @entity2 was happy with the car in qualifying , and in the early stages of the race , and his defensive driving was phenomenal			1
' but his result was n't down to a lack of pace , it was how their different strategies worked out			0
' not for the first time this year , though , @entity0 was again full of praise for @entity5 , who retains a small but unlikely hope of denying @entity8 and @entity72 the title			2
winner of the previous two races in @entity76 and @entity77 , fifth was undeniably the best of the rest given the pace of the @entity82 - powered cars ahead , with the two works cars followed by @entity84			0
' i thought some of @entity5 's moves were fantastic			0
he really drove with precision , ' said @entity0 of @entity5 , who trails @entity8 by 72 points in the standings			2
' for somebody who had a question mark over their overtaking at the beginning of the year , he 's right up there with the best			0
does he continue to surprise me ? absolutely			0
every race is a surprise			0
' his start was shocking , which he 's apologised for , but his recovery - particularly after the stop on to the prime ( hard ) tyre - was extremely impressive			0

@entity5 finished fifth in @entity55 , one place ahead of his @entity1 team - mate
the @entity57 has won three times this season , but @entity2 is yet to take to the top step of the *podium*
@entity2 is 60 points *adrift* of @entity5 with just six races remaining
@entity0 says is has been a ' difficult year ' for the four - times champion
