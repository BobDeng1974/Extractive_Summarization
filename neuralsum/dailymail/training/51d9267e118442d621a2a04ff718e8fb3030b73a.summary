an 85 - year - old @entity1 tourist detained in @entity2 for six weeks for alleged ' war crimes ' has landed back in @entity4 after catching a flight from @entity6			1
@entity2 state media said saturday that @entity8 , a war veteran , was released because he had apologized for his alleged crimes during the @entity10 and because of his age and medical condition			1
speaking after arriving at @entity13 , mr @entity8 said he was glad to be back home and thanked @entity1 and @entity16 diplomats who worked to secure his release			0
' i 'd like to thank the @entity19 and the @entity20 in @entity6			0
it was a great homecoming ! i 'm tired , pleased to be with my family			1
thank you for all the support we 've had			0
he said it felt good to be back home and was looking forward to seeing his family and getting some rest @entity1 vice president @entity39 , who is traveling in @entity40 , welcomed the release and said he talked by phone with @entity8 in @entity6 , offering him a ride home on air force two			0
@entity39 said @entity8 declined because of a direct flight to his home state of @entity47 , which he took later saturday			2
@entity8 's son , @entity48 , said he spoke briefly with his father from @entity6 and that he was ' in excellent spirits and eager to be reunited with his family			2
' ' as you can imagine this has been a very difficult ordeal for us as a family , and particularly for him , ' he said in a statement read outside his home in @entity57 , adding that they will say more about this unusual journey after @entity8 has rested			0
back with his family : @entity8 speaks beside his wife @entity62 after arriving at @entity60 was detained in @entity2 late october at the end of a 10 - day trip to @entity2 together again : @entity8 , left , walks beside his wife @entity62 and son @entity48 after arriving back home			1
his trip to @entity2 came six decades after he oversaw a group of @entity70 wartime guerrillas during the 1950 - 53 war the smiles say it all : ' it 's been a great homecoming ' , said mr @entity8 , who was wearing a blue sport coat and khakis			1
he thanked the @entity1 and @entity16 diplomats who had helped secure his release he 's free ! : veteran @entity1 soldier @entity8 ( c ) , who was detained for over a month in @entity2 , arrives saturday at @entity6 airport last month , @entity8 read from an awkwardly worded alleged confession that apologized for , among other things , killing @entity2 during the war			1
they were his first words since being taken off a plane october 26 by @entity2 authorities while preparing to leave the country after a 10 - day tour			2
analysts questioned whether the statement was coerced , and former @entity70 guerrillas who had worked with @entity8 and fought behind enemy lines during the war disputed some of the details			2
@entity8 's detention highlights the extreme sensitivity with which @entity97 views the 1950 - 53 war , which ended without a formal peace treaty , leaving the @entity101 sill technically in a state of war			1
the conflict is a regular focus of @entity2 propaganda and media , which accuse @entity97 's wartime enemies @entity108 and @entity40 of carrying on the fighting by continuing to push for the @entity2 's overthrow			2
propaganda reel : @entity8 reading a written apology for his alleged crimes both as a tourist and during his participation in the @entity10 , while under detention ' in the @entity1 , we revealingly refer to the @entity10 as the ` forgotten war			1
' most @entity1 do not realize that memory of the war 's violence is at the foundation of @entity2 national identity , ' said @entity124 , an @entity125 specialist at the @entity126 at @entity127 who has twice visited @entity2			1
tension remains on the @entity101 , though @entity97 's angry rhetoric against the @entity1 and @entity70 has toned down compared with its torrent of springtime threats to launch nuclear strikes and restart nuclear bomb fuel production			0
@entity135 spokeswoman @entity134 urged @entity97 to pardon ' as a humanitarian gesture ' another @entity1 , @entity137 , who has been held in the @entity2 for more than a year			0
members of the former @entity70 guerrilla group said in an interview last week with the @entity142 that @entity8 was their adviser			0
some have expressed surprise that @entity8 would take the risk of visiting @entity2 given his association with their group , which is still remembered with keen hatred in the @entity2			1
others were amazed @entity97 still considered @entity8 a threat			0
' why did @entity2 make such a big fuss ? ' @entity152 , a former guerrilla who worked with @entity8 during the war , said saturday			1
' it 's been 60 years since he worked as our adviser			0
' the televised statement read last month by @entity8 said he was attempting to meet surviving guerrilla fighters he had trained during the conflict so he could reconnect them with their wartime colleagues living in @entity70 , and that he had criticized the @entity2 during his recent trip			1
back in the day : @entity164 @entity163 ( bottom row , 4th l ) poses for a group photo with some members of the @entity169 ( top row ) in this photo taken september 1953 @entity8 's political value had ' expired ' for @entity2 , said @entity173 , a senior researcher at @entity175 's @entity174			1
@entity8 's written apology and the tv broadcast were enough for @entity97 to show outsiders that it has maintained its dignity - something the proud country views as paramount , said @entity173			1
there was relief in @entity8 's home state of @entity47			2
' he 's a genuine and generous man , and we 're all so relieved that he 's coming home , ' said @entity186 , executive director of @entity187 , an ocean exploration program in @entity127 that the @entity189 have supported			0
@entity190 has previously said that his father , an avid traveler and retired finance executive from @entity47 , had always wanted to return to the country where he fought during the @entity10			0
before @entity8 , @entity2 detained at least six @entity1 since 2009			1
five of them have been either released or deported after prominent @entity1 like former presidents @entity196 and @entity197 travelled to @entity97			0
' the release is vintage @entity2 , ' @entity198 , president of the @entity199 think tank in @entity202 , said of @entity8			2
' they always try to capture the attention away from something that might make ( @entity70 ) look good and get the spotlight on them instead			0
normally they do this by doing something negative			0
at least in this instance , it was a positive gesture			0

' it 's been a great homecoming , ' @entity8 said upon arrival in @entity4
@entity8 , 85 , was a @entity10 vet who returned to @entity2 with government *approval*
he was detained in october and only released after issuing a *public* apology for his crimes during the war
