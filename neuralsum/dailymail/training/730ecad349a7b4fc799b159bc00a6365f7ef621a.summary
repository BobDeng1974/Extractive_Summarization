by @entity0 he was one of the greatest engineers of @entity3 history , designing and building 25 railway lines , over 100 bridges and three ships including the @entity7 and @entity8			0
she is an award - winning mechanical engineer , a star graduate from the @entity12 , and one of a few women in her field			1
and now , @entity15 , the great - great granddaughter of @entity16 , has been charged with renovating the area around @entity18 , built by @entity16 's contemporaries in 1851 - 52			1
@entity15 , 31 , the great - great granddaughter of @entity16 , has been put in charge of a team of architects and engineers renovating the area around @entity18 at just 31 years old , ms @entity15 will lead a team of architects and engineers tasked with giving a modern - day twist to the old @entity31 structures around the station and bringing them back to life			1
@entity16 was one of the greatest engineers of his time , building 25 railway lines and more than 100 bridges speaking about her ancestor to @entity39 , she said : ' he was an inspiration			1
it definitely runs in the family			0
my grandfather was also an engineer			2
' studying at the @entity12 , she was perfectly placed to admire the brilliance of great - great grandfather			1
in 1833 @entity16 was commissioned to work on the @entity7 linking @entity48 to @entity49 , and accomplished many engineering feats during its construction , including the viaducts at @entity54 and @entity55 , the @entity56 , the @entity57 and @entity58			1
earlier , in 1931 , his designs won a competition to build the @entity61 across the @entity62 which flows through the city			0
while he was responsible for several architectural feats in @entity48 , such as @entity65 from @entity66 to @entity67 , he was n't actually the genius behind @entity69			1
the station was in fact designed by his contemporary , @entity73 , and later details were added by @entity74			1
@entity16 would be proud to know that , 155 years on from his death , his descendent is carrying on with the work he and his contemporaries started			1
when the work on @entity69 is completed it will house more than 18 restaurants , 2,000 new homes , 23 office spaces and a collection of outdoor venues			2
women are woefully under - represented in the construction industry , making up just 11 per cent of the workforce , compared with 50 per cent in finance , 46 per cent of doctors and 27 per cent of police			2
among one of his most spectacular achievement is the @entity61 over the @entity62 while most of his work was completed in the west of @entity98 , he designed bridges across the @entity3 inlcuding this one across the @entity100 in @entity101 , @entity102 it 's something she is keen to change			2
she said : ' it 's not just about being a builder on site			2
it 's about celebrating practical achievements			0
' one of the things i enjoy most about my job is that i am creating tangible things			0
i can show people and say " i was part of this			0
" ' another female engineer keen to engage women is @entity120 , a 30 - year - old structural engineer who worked on the @entity121 in @entity48 and appeared as one of the inspirational women on the recent @entity125 poster campaign			1
she said there was still an element of everyday sexism on building sites , but added : ' as the number of women on site is steadily increasing , it 's only a matter of time before that gets stamped out			0
' @entity16 was a stand - out even in a field of greats , accomplishing a huge amount in a relatively short lifespan over the course of his relatively short life , from 1806 to 1859 , @entity16 was responsible for building over 25 railway lines , more than 100 bridges , eight piers and docks , and three enormous steamships			1
he was a stand - out even in a field which included greats like @entity149 - so - called father of the railways - and @entity152 - who helped build large parts of @entity48 , including @entity154 , @entity155 and @entity156			0
he constructed the @entity7 , linking @entity48 to @entity49 , built the famous @entity157 , and designed five revolutionary suspension bridges including the @entity61 over the @entity62			0
while he is best known for his work on the railways , he was also an accomplished ship builder			0
he built the the ' @entity7 ' , which launched in 1837 and was the first steamship to ferry regular passenger journies across the @entity165			0
the ' @entity8 ' , launched in 1843 , was the world 's first iron - hulled , steam - powered passenger liner to use a screw - propellar , which made ti far more efficient			2
the ' @entity171 ' , launched in 1859 , was designed in cooperation with @entity173 , and was by far the biggest ship ever built , but was so expensive it drove its owner into bankruptcy .			0
