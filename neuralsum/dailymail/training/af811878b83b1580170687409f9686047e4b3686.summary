a fridge - sized asteroid has crashed into the @entity2 , in the largest lunar collision with a space rock ever captured on video			2
incredible video footage has emerged of the spectacular fireball created as the asteroid impacted the @entity9 , a lava - filled basin on the moon			1
@entity12 astronomer @entity11 , a professor at the @entity13 , @entity15 's @entity14 , witnessed the incident on september 11 last year , according to @entity18 reports			1
at one stage , the flare was almost as bright as the @entity43 's @entity42 , according to the @entity14			2
the flash would have been visible to the naked eye for anyone who was looking at the @entity2 at that moment in clear viewing conditions , the @entity14 said			0
after the impact there was an afterglow that lasted a further eight seconds , which was the longest and brightest incident of its kind ever recorded			1
see more videos at @entity11 's @entity55 channel flashing light : footage shows the moment asteroid hits the @entity9 , a lava - filled basin on the moon bright flare : footage shows afterglow following the impact that lasts for eight seconds ' at that moment , i realised that i had seen a very rare and extraordinary event , ' @entity11 told the @entity14			1
two videos have captured the event , including one which features actual footage and another that was posted by the researchers , which includes computer - generated graphics that explain the event in great detail			0
@entity11 's team estimate the asteroid hit the moon at about 61,000 kilometres an hour			1
it was so fast , the rock turned to molten and vaporised , creating the flash and a crater 40 metres in diametre			0
the impact energy was equivalent to an explosion of around 15 tonnes of @entity84 , more than triple the largest previously seen event , claimed by @entity86 in march 2013			2
as a measure of comparison , the asteroid that hit @entity88 , @entity89 , in february last year , is believed to have been about 20 metres wide , weighing 13,000 tonnes			1
it is considered to have been at the lower end of medium - sized asteroids			0
@entity11 and colleagues estimate the rock had a mass of around 400 kilograms , with a diameter of between 60 centimetres and 1.4 metres			0
the team of researchers estimate that asteroids of this size may strike @entity103 about 10 times more frequently than was initially thought			0
however @entity103 is protected by its atmosphere and asteroids of this size burned up as meteors			0
the @entity12 observation is published in the @entity14 journal @entity110 .			2
