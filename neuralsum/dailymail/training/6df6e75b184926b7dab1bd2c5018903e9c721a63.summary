by @entity0 published : 05:12 est , 9 january 2013 updated : 14:29 est , 9 january 2013 a young couple who found themselves longing for a simpler life decided to take the matter of their marital abode in their own hands - quite literally			2
@entity9 and @entity10 live in a perfect miniature home which , despite the fact that their combined knowledge of construction amounted to bare minimum , they built themselves			0
the @entity22 , as the pair have named their cottage - on - wheels , is a 140 sqft wooden structure , complete with kitchen , living room , bathroom and a sleeping loft in @entity28 , @entity29			1
despite having little to no knowledge of how to build a house - or anything at all for that matter - they spent 800 hours over seven months to build their own home and everything within it			1
thanks to @entity9 ’s skills as a 3d artist the pair were able to designed it themselves and make a virtual version of their future home , ahead of grabbing hammer and drill			0
‘ we just had some basic shop class skills from @entity66 ’ , @entity61 explains on their website			2
simple is good : @entity68 and @entity61 traded in the busy life for what they think is the good one - as small as it may seem welcome inside : as you enter the @entity22 you walk straight into the living room and office with the bathroom on the left , and the sleeping loft above it and the small kitchen cramped kitchen : the couple say living small has made them more considerate and a better couple as there is no way squeezing past unnoticed in the kitchen ready , steady , cook : although the pair relied on professional advice regarding electricity and plumbing , they installed it all themselves ‘ the work was done by @entity68 and myself			1
there was a few days where the parents flew in to help out with the roof			0
‘ we had advice help with the electrical and plumbing from a certified person			0
‘ just about everyone we know thought we were crazy , but now , everyone loves the idea of the house ! ' the house has four solar panels and is supplied by a 40 gallon fresh water tank , making it environmentally , as well as financially , friendly			0
meals on wheels : the pair fit their entire lives , work , sleep and eat in this petite cottage picturesque : the house has all the components of a dream home - although some may struggle with the size the green stuff : the @entity22 is parked on rented land and is partly powered by four solar panels a mere six months after the pair moved in to the @entity22 they reaped further benefit from their downsizing as @entity68 lost his job as a ‘ lead creative ’ at @entity134			1
thanks to their choice to live small , they are able to ride out the storm as both maintenance and building costs were relatively low			0
the tacks expect to have paid it off completely within two - three years and keep costs to bills and rent of the land where the @entity22 is parked			0
@entity147 , night : the sleeping loft is located underneath the roof above the kitchen and bathroom looking down : a birds - eye view of the @entity22 from the sleeping loft shortly after it was finished cat not included : the pair are now devoting a lot of their time to the tiny homes movement helping others in their bid to downsize and build their own home handy work : the married couple have built everything in the @entity22 themselves ( apart from the @entity166 double - functioning as a television ) back to nature : despite working in high - tech fields , @entity9 as a @entity172 animation artist and @entity68 previously at @entity134 , they wanted a simpler life outside their professions ‘ without the substantially lower cost of living , we would be struggling financially , ’ @entity175 told the @entity176 , the tacks add that living small made them stronger as a couple , and nicer to one another			1
the cramped situation forces them to respect the individual 's right to their own space and to be more polite , as the tiny kitchen barely allows a squeeze - past			2
