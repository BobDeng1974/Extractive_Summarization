at first glance , it looks like a perfectly normal helicopter			2
but @entity4 ’s new @entity3 is missing one key thing - a pilot			2
the craft , shown off at a trade show this week , has been stuffed with electronics so it can be flown as a drone - but with all the same capabilities as a normal helicopter			1
mockup of an @entity3 from the @entity4 display at the @entity15 2013 the @entity3 looks almost identical to a normal helicopter - but is in fact a drone the ultimate drone in numbers the @entity3 is a fully autonomous , fourblade , single - engine unmanned helicopter			1
' it will carry an array of reconnaissance , surveillance and target acquisition ( @entity28 ) sensors to support warfighters ’ demands for enhanced situational awareness , ' the firm said			1
' the craft combines the best of two proven air systems in a low - cost , fast - fielding package , ' said the defence firm			0
earlier this year the @entity38 awarded @entity4 a $ 71 million contract to procure six additional @entity41 variants , for a total of 30 aircraft			0
@entity44 , vice president for tactical unmanned systems with @entity4 's @entity46 sector said , ' this contract provides significant momentum for the work @entity4 and its supply chain partners are doing to meet the @entity38 's requirements			0
' an artist 's impression of the @entity3 in action the drone is based on a @entity57 helicopter , which is often used by hospitals , news organizations , movie studios and law enforcement agencies worldwide			2
over 1,000 have been sold , with over 3 million accumulated flight hours - but now it is undergoing a radical conversion			0
' @entity3 supports both maritime and land - based missions , taking off and landing on aviation - capable warships , and at prepared and unprepared landing zones in proximity to ground troops			0
a scale model of the @entity74 was revealed , and it is hoped the real thing could be flying this year the complex electronics that can pilot the helicopter remotely			1

@entity74 will be used by @entity79 as a surveillance drone
has same capabilities and range as a @entity84
