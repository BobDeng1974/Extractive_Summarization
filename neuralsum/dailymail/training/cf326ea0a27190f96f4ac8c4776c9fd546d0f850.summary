by @entity0 and @entity2 reporter when the days get shorter and the weather colder , many of us no doubt envy those who have headed for a new life in the sun. however , making such a move can actually leave us more miserable , according to research			0
a study of those who moved to a @entity14 country found their levels of happiness were lower than those who had headed in the opposite direction			0
and official figures from @entity22 authorities show how 90,000 @entity23 packed up and left last year , fleeing the eurozone crisis , high unemployment and a crash in house prices			0
@entity29 changes : this couple may look happy , but scientists have found that those who move to the @entity14 can end up more miserable than if they had stayed at home			1
@entity33 agrees data from the @entity35 reveals how almost a quarter of @entity37 registered with local councils in @entity22 went home last year			0
in all , 87,880 left @entity22 behind after a life in sun failed to live up to the dream			0
in a separate study , @entity44 researchers looked at 256 migrants from @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , and 73 from the @entity37 , who relocated to @entity22 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 in search of a new life			1
the migrants were asked how happy they were on a scale of one to 10 compared with 56,000 people who stayed in the northern countries			1
it was revealed that the migrants were less happy , scoring 7.3 out of ten , compared with the average of 7.5			1
and the gap was even higher for brits with migrants four per cent less happy than those back in @entity68			1
dr @entity69 analysed the data to take account of differences between migrants and those who stayed in terms of age , health , income , education , employment and religious beliefs , to make sure these factors did not distort the results			2
report : on average migrants were found to have higher incomes than the average in their new country he said : ' the key finding from the analysis is that people from northern @entity93 who migrated to southern @entity93 are less happy than the stayers in northern @entity93			1
' on average the migrants were found to have higher incomes than the average in their new country , due to higher education levels			2
many previous studies suggest that these factors would result in a higher social status and levels of happiness			0
however the paper , which will be presented at the @entity105 's annual conference in @entity106 on wednesday revealed that migration can disrupt social ties and make people less happy			2
the gap was even higher for @entity23 , with migrants four per cent less happy than those back in @entity68 ' migration itself can be disruptive to other dimensions of people 's lives - social ties , sense of belonging - possibly with consequences for their happiness , ' said dr @entity69			1
' perhaps any positive subjective consequences were outweighed by negative consequences arising from the more general disruptive effects of international migration on one 's life			0
' within the @entity129 opportunities for such migration are abundant , and migration flows in this mode have reached significant dimensions			0
' the analysis in this paper , however , raises doubts about whether migration in this mode will result in greater happiness for the migrants			2
