@entity15 videos featuring 69 - year - old @entity16 , a @entity17 man who lives on the @entity18 , went viral in @entity3 communities earlier this year			1
in them , @entity16 talks about being mistreated at the @entity22 hospital and shows his abdomen			1

no criminal charges have been filed in the case			1
@entity56 , a lawyer for @entity40 , filed a lawsuit on monday in @entity59 in @entity22 against @entity60 , its board of directors , physicians and @entity63 the lawsuit alleges a civil rights violation based on race and cites the scarring from @entity40 's double - bypass surgery done in august 2011 as evidence			1
it seeks a jury trial and damages			1
' defendants injured , carved , burned , and / or cared for @entity75 's abdomen in such a manner that scars resembling three letters " k " were permanently placed on @entity75 's abdomen for no medically necessary purpose or reason , and in the process injured , carved , burned , and / or cared for other portions of @entity75 's body to cause injury , specifically his abdomen and back , ' the lawsuit stated			1
@entity88 , chief executive of @entity60 , said in a statement that the hospital will ' vigorously defend this claim '			1

' i think the native people have been fighting racial hatred for many years in @entity22 , but you know , it 's not all the people that are hateful toward @entity47 , ' said @entity16 , who recently had another heart surgery in @entity127 , @entity128			1
' we have a good segment of our society -- white society -- in @entity22 that are @entity134 people and they get along good with the @entity47			1
in my instance , i believe i 'm dealing with the @entity4 , and that 's a small minority			2
' as well as the marks on his skin , he said the staff was also abusive towards him and when he told them how much pain he was in , no one did anything to help him			2
' i had a confrontation with a male nurse while i was in intensive care , ' he said			2
' i was in so much pain , i begged him for pain medication			2
' he told me to shut my f * * * ing mouth or he ’d shut it for me			2
i did n’t provoke him			2
i did n’t disrespect him			2
' when he asked to be sent to a rehabilitation center because the pain was so bad , they said this was approved - but instead discharged him			2
on the day he was discharged , a nurse at the hospital told mr @entity16 that he should get someone to take a picture of the surgery scars on his stomach and his back			2
the nurse said she would not testify on his behalf but could n't live with herself without at least alerting him to the scars			0
she said to him : ' my conscience wo n’t let me be			0
it ’s bothered me for days			0
something was done to you , and i believe it was wrong			0
' i ca n’t sleep			0
i keep thinking about what they did to you			0
' scars : mr @entity16 had an old wound reopened on his back and two more cuts above it			0
on his abdomen the letters @entity181 can be seen point out : a @entity15 video made about his story shows where the @entity181 letters are for those who do not recognize them			0
it was a nurse who first alerted mr @entity16 to the scars he told the @entity191 after the operation : ' you can see the surgery sutures , and they ’re clean			0
' but those three letters , two good - sized ks and one smaller one off to the side , had to be made with some sharp knife or heated instrument			0
it ’s like they branded me			0
' this is what a scar from heart surgery should look like ( file photo ) @entity208 , a member of the @entity210 , and @entity211 , a member of the @entity212 , which @entity40 belongs to , organized the may rally in an effort to bring attention to what they say is continued mistreatment of @entity3 people			0
@entity208 declined to comment about the lawsuit			0
while @entity16 's story spurred the protest , many @entity47 who attended referred to broken treaties , unsolved murders and incarceration rates among @entity47 as their reasons for showing up			0
they included @entity227 , who helped found the @entity228 in the late 1960s to protest the @entity231 government 's treatment of @entity47 and demand the government honor its treaties with @entity47 tribes			1
