by @entity0 published : 23:46 est , 13 september 2012 updated : 23:47 est , 13 september 2012 president @entity1 has clearly stayed in style as @entity3 , the editor - in - chief of @entity4 , has raised a total of $ 2.7million for the commander - in - chief and his fellow @entity7 since 2008			2
according to newly - released campaign finance reports , the president has cultivated a larger and more monied group of wealthy donors for the 2012 presidential bid than he did during his inaugural race			1
those bold - faced names who write checks and host fundraisers to convince their friends to do the same - dubbed ' bundlers ' for their hefty donations - include @entity21 , the former @entity23 executive who just recently became the ceo of @entity25 , actress @entity26 who doubles as one of the co-chairs for the re-election campaign , and the discerning editor herself			1
made the cut : @entity3 , a large @entity1 donor , and her longtime partner @entity33 were invited to the @entity34 at the @entity35 when prime minister @entity36 came to visit in march			2
ms @entity3 , who is a dual citizen of the @entity37 and her native @entity38 , is the fourth - highest - grossing bundler over the past four years , bringing in a total of $ 2.7million for the president and fellow @entity7			2
the data comes from financial records obtained by @entity44 , and while it portrays a varied and deep - pocketed group of funders , they only refer to donations made up until may of this year			2
as a result , any of the tens - of - millions raised over the summer and after the @entity7 national convention is not included			2
@entity3 has lent hosted a number of fundraisers for the president in the past few months , all of which have shown the strength of her rolodex			0
in may , she co-hosted a $ 40,000 - per - plate dinner for 50 people in actress @entity63 's @entity62 townhouse			1
prior to the dinner , she even appeared in a @entity66 video promoting the dinner which offered up two raffled tickets to the event			0
in august , she moved her sights out of the city and partnered up with @entity73 producer @entity72 and his fashion designer wife @entity74 to host a $ 38,500 - per - plate dinner in their @entity77 home			0
moving down the list of his top fundraisers , @entity26 and @entity83 's names stand out given their star power			1
desperate for donors : @entity26 has raised $ 271,300 for the president and spoke at the @entity88 ( right ) @entity35 visits : @entity21 ( left ) is seen joining the @entity89 ( center ) and @entity91 ( right ) during a women 's history month event			1
all told , @entity83 's bundling has contributed $ 386,000 @entity26 , known best for her role on @entity96 , raised $ 271,300 for the president since 2011 and she does not simply write checks			1
she has made numerous campaign appearances - particularly those aimed at attracting younger and minority voters			0
she even gave a speech at the convention stage in @entity104 , @entity105			0
while the records show that @entity26 only started bundling during this campaign , @entity83 's devotion to @entity7 causes dates back to 2007			1
over the past two years , @entity83 has been responsible for $ 112,400 but all told , her bundling has contributed $ 386,000			0
increased access and prominent political appointments are common rewards for top bundlers , and that presents a problem that president @entity1 's campaigners have to contend with that the @entity120 camp does not face : he awarded political positions and ambassadorships to a number of his top contributors from 2008			1
as a result , those individuals are barred from giving this time around because of federal election laws			0
former ambassadors : @entity129 , who served as ambassador to @entity131 , and @entity132 , who was ambassador to @entity133 , were both appointed by @entity134 and now are bundlers for @entity1 those laws , however , do not apply to former ambassadors which explains why two of former president @entity134 - appointed ambassadors have become @entity1 bundlers			0
former ambassador to @entity131 , @entity129 , has raised $ 545,300 for the president , as has former ambassador to @entity133 , @entity144 , who has raised more than $ 1.5million for the president and @entity7 since 2007			0
considering her prominent position on the donor list and the cycle of turning donors into ambassadors , it comes as little surprise that @entity3 's name has been floated as a possibility			1
though the fashion world may stop turning as a result , she has never publicly discussed the option			0
