by @entity0 and @entity1 shifting blame : @entity3 rejected the claims by @entity6 chief executive @entity5 , pictured parents would be able to cut their energy bills if their children learned to turn off their lights , tvs and @entity12 , the head of @entity6 claimed today			1
chief executive @entity5 claimed even his own teenage daughters wasted electricity , and people must stop fewer power something than can be easily wasted			1
he also tried to shift the blame for higher charges from the industry to the government , claiming eco-schemes are the biggest driver of costs			0
green taxes will more than double by 2020 , pushing up bills to £ 1,500 - a - year , the @entity27 - owned firm claimed today			1
but mr @entity5 courted controversy when he suggested gas and electricity bills are high only because households waste so much power			1
' the reality is that we have some of the cheapest prices in @entity38 but our bills are some of the highest because our houses are old and not insulated			2
' he told @entity42 's today programme			2
i have two teenage daughters			0
they have been brought up in a generation that has looked at energy efficiency , that has looked at climate change			0
' they would never dream of walking out of a bathroom leaving the taps running			0
and yet my teenage daughters will walk out of a room and leave the lights on and their @entity12 playing and the tv on quite happily			0
' so i do think we need to change our approach and the way we think about energy waste			0
' saying he wanted to dispel myths and restore trust , he insisted suppliers were responsible for only 20 per cent of a bill			1
he added : ‘ the actual unit price of energy in the @entity67 is one of the lowest in @entity38 – but bills are high because @entity67 houses waste so much energy			2
‘ if we can increase the efficiency of the @entity67 ’s old and draughty housing , we can ensure that annual energy bills are some of the lowest too			2
’ the chief executive ’s claims were immediately rejected by industry regulator @entity3			1
a spokesman said : ‘ their data on network costs is incorrect and misleading			1
’ @entity6 boss @entity5 mr @entity5 made his comments ahead of a report his @entity27 - owned firm publishes today on the energy market			1
it said the cost of green taxes and eco schemes will rise by 272 per cent between 2007 and 2020 , driving up energy bills			1
@entity6 says the average figure paid by householders through levies on bills under the heading of ‘ government energy policy and regulation costs ’ will rise from £ 75 in 2007 to at least £ 279 by 2020			1
by contrast , it says the average cost of supplying a home with energy – gas and electricity – over the same period will actually fall from £ 514 a year to £ 408			0
the company ’s figures suggest the cost of shifting energy supply away from fossil fuels toward wind , solar and wave power , coupled with schemes to insulate homes are the main reason for rising bills			2
the cost of building nuclear power stations , which will also be subsidised through bills , will push up the prices paid			0
the figures are included in an @entity6 report called ‘ @entity122 ’ , which is designed to help customers understand why their bills are going up			1
burning money : a report by @entity6 has warned prices will rise still further due to the cost of building nuclear power stations			1
it claims government policies will push the average household bill to £ 1,330 in 2020 the company ’s calculations suggest @entity135 policies , coupled with the fact we live in cold and draughty homes , are largely responsible for a predicted rise in energy bills from £ 954 a year in 2007 to £ 1,330 in 2020			1
mr @entity5 said : ‘ at times during the debate on energy , facts have been in short supply , but we urgently need to dispel some myths to restore trust in the energy industry			1
' suppliers control less than 20 per cent of a bill and i want to shine a light on all the different aspects of energy – particularly to reassure my customers that there is no hidden profit			1
‘ we made a 3.2 per cent margin in our retail business in the first nine months of 2013			1
‘ over the same period our power stations were struggling to recoup the hundreds of millions of pounds in investment required to build them , and made a loss of £ 59million			0
’ ' misleading ' : a spokesman for @entity3 said @entity6 declined to work with them to make the data accurate but the @entity3 spokesman disputed the research : ‘ we offered to help @entity6 improve the accuracy of their numbers for network charges and it is disappointing that they did not engage fully with us until after the document had been circulated			1
‘ @entity3 directly regulates the money that network companies can earn through charges			2
‘ given this level of certainty we can see that after 2014 network costs per household are expected to remain broadly flat in real terms			0
it is unclear how @entity6 can state with any authority otherwise			2
