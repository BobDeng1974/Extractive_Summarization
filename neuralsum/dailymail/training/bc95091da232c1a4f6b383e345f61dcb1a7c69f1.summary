@entity1 travellers have had their holiday plans ruined when they were sent what they say was the ' the worst text ' on @entity5 – cancelling their flights with just a day 's notice			1
the @entity10 ' @entity9 ' airline had been promoting their new route for months , promising to fly passengers directly from @entity13 to @entity14 after a december 26 launch			1
instead , they sent out frantic texts on christmas day to passengers , informing them that flights from @entity19 onwards were not only cancelled , but their expected travel time on their new flights was now doubled from five - and - a - half hours to a lengthy 13 hours			1
weddings and travel plans went out the window when the commuters were informed they would now stop over at @entity26 , meaning many travellers would arrive a day later than they had planned			0
' this was until you changed my daughter in laws and sons direct flight from the 27th dec 2014 to leave on the 28th dec with a stop over in kuala lumpur in which they will miss the whole wedding ! ! ' wrote @entity34			0
it all occurred due to an ' administration issue ' according to @entity9			0
rumours are flying , unlike the airline , that @entity9 is not authorised by air controllers to fly from @entity13 to @entity70			2
an @entity29 spokesman confirmed that ' an unforseen delay in the approval process for necessary documentation , ' was the reason for the delay			0
' @entity78 is working closely with all relevant authorities including the @entity80 and @entity81 ( @entity82 ) to ensure that the administration process can be completed as soon as possible , ' an @entity29 spokesman told @entity84			0
' @entity78 will commence the direct return flight from @entity70 to @entity13 as scheduled as soon as this process has been completed			2
passengers have been put on new flights and will now have to change over at @entity26 airport ( pictured ) @entity90 ( left ) and @entity91 ( right ) are furious that their flights have been cancelled and that they have received ' appalling customer service ' by writing messages on @entity39 travellers are enraged that the airline has been selling tickets for the flights since october , pledging to carry 377 passengers five times a week			1
the airasia facebook page has been flooded with angry messages from jilted customers , complaining about the major gaffe			0
' you should n't have advertised / sold flights under the guise of them being available when they were n't			0
if you were n't allowed to fly direct from @entity13 – @entity14 then why advertise that you can ? ' wrote @entity109			2
' i am keen to investigate under @entity111 as this surely is false advertising , ' added @entity113			0
' this morning ( @entity5 morning ) we got a phonecall from @entity9 saying that our flight to @entity14 which was scheduled to leave at 10:40 am on the 26th of dec ( tomorrow ) has been delayed to 05:00 pm and will fly thru @entity26 instead of being a direct flight			1
we were supposed to reach @entity14 at 01:00 pm but now we will reach 14 hours later at 03:00 am , ' explained @entity118			0
ms @entity91 is furious that her ' transfers and accommodation ' are now going to waste and is concerned that she does not know what will happen with her return flight , which had promised to fly her straight from @entity14 to @entity13 with @entity9 @entity90 was concerned that he had not been contacted about whether or not his december 28 flight would be affected , despite the news that flights were indefinitely grounded ms @entity34 is devastated about the impact this decision has had on her daughter 's wedding , which was further exacerbated by the ' poor service ' they received from @entity9			1
she explained in her @entity39 page that that they were ' hung up on fifteen times ' while trying to change their flights , and then transferred to a call centre where they encountered a serious language barrier			1
' this service is beyond unacceptable and due to this my two kids will miss this very special day and they can not afford another $ 1700 each to change their flights ! ' ' the biggest issue is that it 's such short notice that all the other direct flights are more than $ 1000 direct , ' affected traveller @entity148 told @entity84			2
other customers are livid that @entity9 will not compensate the travellers for the prepaid accommodation , transfers and other activities which will be missed due to the last - minute change in their flights			1
an @entity29 spokesman confirmed that ' an unforseen delay in the approval process for necessary documentation , ' was the reason for the delay traveller @entity113 wrote a bitter message on @entity39 , sarcastically posting ' thanks for the @entity166 text ' on their @entity39 page , @entity9 sent messages to furious customers to apologise for the fiasco			1
' the re-route via @entity26 ( @entity26 ) is a temporary solution as we work with authorities in the coming days to overcome the issue , ' wrote @entity9 on @entity39 , not explaining to customers what exactly the ' issue ' is which has caused all flights to be cancelled			1
customers were not satisfied by @entity9 's response when they demanded to know how they would be compensated for the lost funds			0
' for any extra costs , we recommend you contact your travel insurance provider			0
this is a temporary issue , and we 're working with government agencies to be able to commence our direct services as soon as possible in the near future			0
' @entity90 was pro-active , asking @entity9 on @entity39 if they could give him slightly more notice if his december 28 flight was set to be re-routed			2
' any idea if the direct flight from @entity13 to @entity14 on the 28th departing at 10:40 will be re-routed as well ? thought i 'd be proactive and ask here first rather than wait for the news to be delivered by carrier pigeon 7 days after my flight			2
' @entity200 will also miss a friend 's wedding and is angry that the airline does n't seem to care , because they already have her ' hard earned money ' some travellers will arrive at @entity207 more than 24 hours than they had originally planned			1

@entity9 have cancelled all direct flights from @entity13 to @entity14
the direct route was planned to launch on december 26
it 's understood the airline does not have the required approval from @entity217 and @entity10 aviation authorities
travellers were sent texts about the cancellation on @entity5 - just *12* hours before some of the scheduled flights
furious *patrons* have left complaints on @entity228 's @entity39 page
one woman explains that her daughter 's family will not arrive in time for her @entity14 wedding
the airline will not compensate passengers for prepaid accommodation , transfers and other costs which are lost due to flight delay
