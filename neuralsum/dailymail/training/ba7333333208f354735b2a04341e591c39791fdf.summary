‘ captain ’ @entity7 is being forced to sell the mock @entity12 after he was made to move the vessel 100 yards from @entity9 in @entity10 and visitors disappeared			2
only a fifth of the length of a real - life submarine the @entity17 replica u-boat is priced at £ 30,000			0
captain : @entity7 built the replica from an old canal narrow boat and now welcomes visitors to his museum the boat has been moored outside the @entity9 at @entity25 in @entity10 attracting tourists and museum visitors to come and have a look inside the submarine			1
however , a recent request from @entity32 waterways for it to be moved 100 yards away made it less visible to museum - goers , and killing the trade for mr @entity7 and his crew			0
the self - styled ' captain ' @entity7 built the submarine from an old canal boat and with the help of a company which supplied props for the @entity42 and @entity44 movies it was turned into a floating museum			1
the mock u- 8047 u-boat stands out alongside the other canal boats in its new home the dock unlike its previous spot near the @entity9 the floating museum is a hybrid of a @entity55 u-boat and a @entity32 submarine from the @entity17 captain @entity7 , 52 , said : ‘ i ’m gutted			1
we were offered a place here , we came here			0
‘ we ’re all volunteers and do n’t make any money out of it			0
‘ we suffered the winter and lost a lot of money which we were expecting to make back in the summer , but we are not doing 10 per cent of what we were doing			0
’ capt @entity7 , who spent 50,000 pounds creating the hybrid @entity55 u-boat and @entity32 submarine , is hoping the boat can be sold but still run by the current “ crew ” , aided by corporate sponsors , or sold outright			2
the boat is a much smaller version of the real thing - only a fifth of the size of a real submarine - and is the only floating submarine museum in the world if you are not a museum sort of person , the boat is still fully functioning as a narrow boat - but you would probably get some funny looks from the shores the boat , which has a coning tower , periscope and torpedo room , is being sold with @entity55 and @entity32 items , uniforms , sonar , whoopar horn and morse key			1
capt @entity7 added : ‘ this is a unique opportunity to own the world ’s only mobile submarine museum , which is based in @entity10 but able to travel the canal network			2
’ the boat is currently operated under the @entity99 , a social enterprise offering children education about @entity55 submarines during the @entity17			0
children are allowed free entry and adults are asked to make a 1 pound donation for visits			0
the boast cost captain @entity7 £ 50,000 to make and the interior was made with the help of prop - workers from the @entity44 and @entity42 movies fans of memorabilia and collectors alike can get their hands on the u- 8047 for £ 30,000			1
