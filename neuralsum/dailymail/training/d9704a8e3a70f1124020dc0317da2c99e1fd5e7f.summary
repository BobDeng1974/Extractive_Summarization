by @entity0 the stopped watch , pipe and other last possessions of a first world war hero have gone on display 99 years after his death			1
the belongings of 36 - year - old @entity9 include his mud - encrusted watch which was stopped at 8pm on 1 december 1915 - the exact moment he was killed by a @entity13 mine in the @entity15 region , northern @entity16			1
but the objects , covered in the mud from the tunnels in which lieutenant @entity9 died , were only discovered 99 years later because his heartbroken widow @entity20 was too distressed to look at them			1
the watch worn by @entity23 was frozen at 8pm on 1 december 1915 , the exact moment he was killed by a @entity13 mine			1
the watch lay untouched for 99 years after his widow was too heartbroken to look at it his grandson @entity31 found the sacred items just this year and has donated them to the @entity33 in @entity34 , in lieutenant @entity9 's home village			1
after his death , lieutenant @entity37 's surviving comrades scoured the @entity16 frontline where he fought to gather his kit bag , letters , binoculars and other belongings			1
@entity9 , who was killed on 1 december 1915 , aged 36 , by a @entity13 mine they then posted them back to @entity46 , @entity47 , where lieutenant @entity9 's family was living at the time			1
but his widow could not bear to open the parcel and his daughter had just a brief look before it was packed away			2
the mementos then lay untouched , covered in the mud from the @entity15 tunnels in which he had battled , for nearly a century			2
it was then only this year that lieutenant @entity9 's grandson @entity31 , also from @entity34 , stumbled across them			1
lieutenant @entity37 was working overseas as a mining engineer when war was declared			2
he returned home to sign up and was seconded to the @entity64 of the @entity65			0
an expert in digging tunnels and sinking shafts , lieutenant @entity9 was put in charge of a team of @entity34 miners			1
the team 's job was to tunnel under the @entity13 trenches in northern @entity16 to lay explosives			1
his team had just retreated in december 1915 , after setting a series of charges , when the enemy detonated a huge mine			2
the blast killed him and four of his fellow countrymen			0
after lieutenant @entity9 's death fighting in the @entity15 region of northern @entity16 , his pipe and binoculars were sent back to his widow , who was living in @entity46 , @entity47 at the time , by his comrades they are buried in @entity91 at @entity92 , a village on the @entity15 , near @entity93			1
lieutenant @entity9 's widow commissioned a memorial plaque in her local church to honour her husband and his dead comrades			1
she also wrote to their families to pay her respects			0
when the items were found , mr @entity31 donated them to the @entity33 where they will feature as part of a memorial exhibition , marking the @entity107 's centenary			1
museum spokeswoman @entity108 said the personal nature of the items offered a tangible reminder of the terrible loss suffered by soldiers ' families			2
a page from the sketch book of another unnamed @entity107 hero , which is also on display at the exhibition these sketches from the @entity107 , taken from an unknown person 's sketchbook , will also be on display at the exhibition she said : ' his widow never opened it , his daughter looked at it once , and his grandson , @entity31 , generously offered it to us			2
we were amazed when @entity31 brought it in			2
' among the possessions are his shirt , pipe and mud - encrusted watch , stopped at precisely 8pm , the time of his death			1
' there is a letter to his widow , written by a fellow officer from the battlefield , and a great deal of correspondence			0
' the exhibition will also include a sketch pad containing drawings from an unknown artist			0
in late 1914 , it became clear that new tactics were needed for both sides to break through the enemy 's entrenched positions			0
so the @entity155 employed companies of engineers to start digging attacking tunnels under the enemy lines			2
tunnelling would involve digging under the enemy lines , placing explosives in the tunnels and blowing them up			0
once a tunnel was discovered , it would be destroyed by the enemy			0
for the infantry above ground , the wait for underground explosions was nerve - wracking			0
for the men underground , the explosions often meant sudden death			0
it became a good way of moving into an enemy territory			0
but there was a constant struggle to find the areas where the conditions were most favourable - and to rebuild in areas which had been targetted by the enemy			0
as the two sides created tunnels and counter tunnels , there were many underground encounters			0
sometimes a tunnelling team would break into an enemy position and meet the enemy underground			0
this would lead to fighting in the tunnels .			0
