@entity0 has been ' outstanding ' ever since he broke into the @entity2 team and @entity4 team - mate @entity3 believes there is no limit to his potential			1
four and a half years ago the @entity8 beat the likes of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 to the signature of @entity16 's nippy @entity15 - born attacker			1
@entity0 , like so many preciously - talented teenagers , was hailed as a wonder kid but is one of few to look as if he is getting anywhere near to fulfilling the hype			2
oustanding : @entity0 has been a stand - out performer for @entity2 this summer at the age of 19 , he has established himself as a first - team regular at @entity4 as well as an increasingly important member of the @entity2 team			1
he was one of few players to impress during the summer 's disastrous @entity28 campaign and has started the season wonderfully , following up a man - of - the - match display in @entity4 's 3 - 0 win at @entity32 by winning the same award just days later as @entity2 defeated @entity34 1 - 0			1
' i think @entity0 has been outstanding since he 's come into the @entity2 first team , ' @entity4 and @entity2 team - mate @entity3 said after the match			1
@entity2 : in a flat performance against @entity34 , @entity0 was comfortably @entity2 's best player ' i thought he was outstanding in both games at the @entity28			1
for a 19 - year - old to play on the world stage like that i thought he was magnificent			2
' he continues to do it every week for @entity4 and he got man of the match again against @entity34 , so he 's a very level - headed for a young lad his age			2
his football brain is not as young as that			0
' he 's really clever with his positioning			0
he drives forward the ball			0
hopefully he can continue improving and working hard			0
' @entity0 plays with no fear			2
he just wants to get the ball run at people and take them on			0
' @entity3 hopes @entity0 continues that fine form when @entity2 begin their @entity59 qualifying campaign with arguably their toughest match of @entity61 in @entity62			1
team - mate : @entity3 was impressed by @entity0 's developmentat the @entity28 a similarly impressive display may well tip the balance in @entity2 's favour at @entity67 and would only see his star rise further			1
@entity3 believes @entity0 will thrive under such scrutiny and , having seemingly sorted out some off - field issues , backed him to kick on			1
' i think he was 16 when i first saw him training with us , ' he said			0
' you could see he had the mentality to be a top player , but we try to keep his feet on the ground			0
' he 's got the right people around him at the club and off the field as well			0
if he keeps working hard , with the players and the manager he has at @entity4 he can really kick on			2
environment : @entity3 believes @entity0 has the right people around him at the moment to help him grow ' i do n't think he 's going to get carried away by it			1
he 's got the right people around him off the field for @entity4 and @entity2			1
i 'm sure he 'll keep his feet on the ground			0
' but as a young millionaire doing a job you love , how hard is it to not get distracted ? ' it 's not that difficult , ' @entity3 said with a wry smile			2
' it just depends what type of person you are			0
' you have to concentrate on your football and not let anything outside affect you , enjoy playing and work as hard as you can in training , try to improve your game all the time			0
' i think that 's really important as well			0

@entity0 has been ' outstanding ' for @entity2
that is the opinion of @entity3
