@entity0 thought she was making history this month as the first woman bishop for the @entity3			0
but it seems she was pipped to the post by an 11 - year - old schoolgirl			1
@entity7 , from @entity8 , became @entity10 's first female bishop when she took over from the @entity11 at the beginning of december - a post she will hold until @entity14 on january 6			1
at just 11 years old , @entity7 has accepted the role of ' girl priest ' in her local @entity17 the service where @entity7 took over from the current @entity11 , left , at the beginning of december involved her pulling him out of his chair and sitting in it herself wearing her ceremonial robes the ceremonial post has always been held by a boy but with the church 's new rulings about women , the schoolgirl is making history of her own			1
she told @entity31 : ' i was really excited ever since i found out i was going to be girl bishop			0
' really women are just as good as boys i think , they ’re both equal to each other			1
if a boy can be bishop , i do n’t see why girls ca n’t			2
i just believe that girls have a right to be as good as boys			1
' as regular churchgoers , @entity7 said her parents are very supportive of her new position , although her little sister feels a bit left out			1
her priest suggested @entity7 for the role			1
' @entity48 asked my mum if i wanted to think about it and as soon as i agreed it was announced in church			0
' they ’d decided it would be nice to have a girl			0
if i ’d disagreed there were lots of others who would have done it , ' she said			0
@entity7 , here with associate priest @entity61 , says girls have a ' right to be as good as boys ' the @entity67 tradition sees the serving @entity11 symbolically step down from his duties at the church and a young church member take over the responsibilities during the festive season			1
@entity7 was officially invested at a special service on monday by the bishop , @entity74			2
during the ceremony , she had to pull him out of his chair and sit in it herself			0
church warden @entity79 told the @entity80 : ' @entity7 is our first ever girl bishop and she will be the country ’s first female bishop because the first female bishop has n’t yet been appointed after the decision was made to allow female bishops			2
' we met to decide who would make a good bishop and @entity7 is a lovely girl and she comes to church every week			1
' we asked the @entity11 @entity74 if we could have a girl bishop and he gave his approval			2
' @entity0 made history when she was announced as the @entity3 's first woman bishop @entity93 , 48 , was recently announced as the first female bishop in the @entity3			0
the saxophone - playing mother - of - two has spent much of her career working in the north east and was announced as the new @entity99 , an assistant in the @entity100			0
