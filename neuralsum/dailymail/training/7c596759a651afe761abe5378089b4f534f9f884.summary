' ' she had so much freedom			0
unique start : @entity15 , aged one and a half , drinking from her bottle among an elephant herd in @entity41 , @entity42 real life mowgli : @entity15 aged 6 sitting with @entity68 , a tame adult leopard in @entity51 trip of a lifetime : living with her @entity47 parents , wildlife photographers @entity43 and @entity45			1

we lived in a tent , completely in the wild , but she always woke up with the sun shining and her parents around her			1
' and the incredible photos - from sitting on the back of an ostrich , lying peacefully with a young caracal , or dancing playfully with an elephant - show an unusual bond and tranquility between man and beast			2

she would talk to them with her eyes and her heart , ' said @entity43			0

she would just speak to him like she would speak to me			0
they used to call her ' the little girl who would talk with animals			2
' @entity15 was able to form strong bonds with some of the most dangerous beasts in the animal kingdom because they were used to humans			1
most of the animals had been orphaned and raised by farmers			0
however , despite the apparent ease and comfort with which they interact , @entity43 always put @entity15 's safety first			1
' you ca n't just meet any of these animals and act like this with them , ' explains @entity43			0
' wild animals will either run away or attack you if they are either frightened , injured or need to protect their young			1

' i had the least fear i would n't have let @entity15 anywhere near them			1

' the year after this photo we came back and we went to see him and he was huge			0
' @entity176 came to @entity15 and he friendly brushed her with his long tail , like a cat would do , and she almost fell down			1
i had to take her away - i was not at ease			0
' but she was only ever bitten once on the nose by a @entity185 , only two bites ! ' this is funny because @entity15 's middle name is @entity188 , meaning mongoose or meerkat			1
they were part of her family in @entity18 , so i wanted her to have something to take home with her			2
' ' the second incident was when she met with @entity166 the baboon at a water point			0
@entity166 attacked @entity15 's hair and pulled out a handful , out of jealousy			2
' that was terribly painful ! wild animals are unpredictable			1
we ca n't be sure of their reaction as we are not of the same species , we do n't know all of their behaviour codes			0
