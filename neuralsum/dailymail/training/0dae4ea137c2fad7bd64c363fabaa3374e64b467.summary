by @entity1 - @entity0 when she suffered a massive stroke , @entity2 needed lifesaving five - hour surgery – and her distraught family were prepared for the worst			1
so it felt like a miracle that once she was allowed home , there were no significant lasting physical effects			1
in fact , the damage caused by a burst blood vessel in her brain was far more insidious @entity2 , 52 , former manager of retail at the @entity18 in @entity19 , recalls : ‘ the stroke happened without any warning one morning as a terrible pain in my head and uncontrollable sickness			1
invisible struggle : @entity2 , from @entity19 , has found that the stroke four - and - a - half years ago had left her unable to make even the simplest of decisions ‘ although i was home alone , i was able to call an ambulance myself , and lived very close to @entity30 , @entity19 , a specialist stroke centre			1
for months afterwards i had constant flashbacks of those moments , and could n’t stop crying			2
but that was just the start of it			2
’ @entity2 found that the stroke four - and - a - half years ago had left her unable to make even the simplest of decisions , such as getting dressed			1
‘ i just sat in a chair for hours not knowing what to wear			2
it was the same with shopping			2
‘ like most people , i always had a list at the supermarket , but if the list did n’t specify exactly which brand name , i ’d stand in an aisle not knowing which to buy			2
’ professor @entity49 , from @entity50 , a psychologist who specialises in stroke , says : ‘ a stroke can be caused by a blockage in the arteries that supply the brain or by bleeding , which can be caused by injury or a weakness in the blood vessels			1
the result is brain damage , which can affect everything from speech and movement to reading ability			1
stroked off : @entity2 's damage was caused caused by a burst blood vessel in her brain ‘ normally , the worst impairment is seen immediately after a stroke and , as bruising and swelling heals , improvement is seen			1
we know that two - thirds of stroke patients experience psychological problems , including depression , fatigue , sexual problems and changes in identity			1
‘ this can be the result of physical disability leading to isolation , but also happens without it			1
whether or not the brain damage causes the psychological problems is n’t always clear			2
’ further psychological assessment at the @entity90 in @entity19 revealed the extent of @entity2 ’s problems			1
‘ the things that had been affected were all the things i ’d been good at : multi-tasking , forward - planning , thinking on the spot , working out implications , nuance			1
it made me laugh , then i cried			2
’ her doctors referred her for psychotherapy to help her adjust			2
‘ i ’d been a high achiever – an alpha female			0
at work , i had a staff of more than 50 and an £ 8 million budget			0
‘ with a husband and two teenage daughters , i would have said i was one of those “ superwomen ”			0
suddenly , i had to adjust to a learning disability			0
now i work one day a week welcoming visitors to my workplace			0
i ’m especially geared up to look out for people like me with less obvious disability			0
’ family life has changed , too			0
‘ my husband @entity116 , a supervisor at the @entity117 , has to run the house			0
we have a deep , loving relationship of companionship , but it ’s not like before when we sparked off each other			0
‘ he cosseted me like an invalid for the first year afterwards , and is still terrified it could happen again			0
she adds : ‘ i still do n’t like meeting new people as they ’ll just think i ’m slow			0
i ca n’t tell what direction sound comes from , so i feel disorientated all the time and suffer massive anxiety because of it			0
it means i ca n’t go to the cinema or pub any more , and i watch television on my own as otherwise i keep asking what ’s happening because i ca n’t follow complicated programmes			0
’ the effect on @entity2 ’s daughters , @entity139 , 20 , and @entity140 , 24 , was more dramatic			1
‘ they became noticeably distant , ’ she says			0
‘ my doctor explained they were frightened of getting close again in case i died			0
‘ then , about five months into my recovery , i noticed @entity139 was very thin			0
i was distraught when she was diagnosed with anorexia			0
basically , she could n’t control the outcome of my stroke but she could control eating			1
‘ both are still looking for their “ mum ”			0
but i could n’t cope with anything dramatic , like boyfriend troubles			0
’ @entity2 has been helped by counselling and occupational therapy and wants to emphasise the emotional impact a stroke can have			1
‘ there has been practical help – i have organised all my clothes into colours and outfits so i do n’t have to make so many decisions when dressing			1
my therapist has helped me grieve for the person i used to be , but it has taken me three years to accept where i am now			2
’ new data suggests that stroke patients and their families in up to two - thirds of the country have no access to psychological support			1
@entity2 says : ‘ people need to realise that even if a survivor looks ok , their lives are almost always much more challenging			1

@entity2 , from @entity19 , suffered a stroke four - and - a - half years ago
ms @entity2 , 52 , has lifesaving surgery and had no physical effects from it
however , she 's lost the ability to make decisions , even the most basic
