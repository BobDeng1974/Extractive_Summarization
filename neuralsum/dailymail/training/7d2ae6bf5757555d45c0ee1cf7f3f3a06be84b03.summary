by @entity0 published : 18:30 est , 5 april 2013 updated : 18:58 est , 5 april 2013 prime minister @entity1 , pictured in his @entity3 constituency , insisted the @entity5 case raised questions about the welfare state the case of child killer @entity5 does raise ‘ wider questions ’ about @entity11 ’s benefits system , @entity1 insisted last night			1
the prime minister defied vitriolic attacks from @entity13 and the @entity14 to back chancellor @entity15 in arguing that the @entity5 case highlights the need for reform of the welfare system			1
in a direct reference to the case , mr @entity1 said welfare handouts should not be seen as a ‘ lifestyle choice ’			1
he added : ‘ i think what @entity15 said was absolutely right			2
‘ he said @entity5 was the one to blame for his crimes , that he should be held responsible			1
' but what the chancellor went on to say was that we should ask some wider questions about our welfare system , how much it costs and the signals that it sends			2
‘ and we do want to make clear that welfare is there to help people who work hard , it should n’t be there as a sort of lifestyle choice , and that ’s entirely legitimate			1
’ mr @entity1 ’s intervention in the row underlines @entity44 determination not to back down in the growing national debate sparked by public outrage over the @entity5 case			2
@entity5 , a father of 17 , was jailed for life on thursday for the manslaughter of six of his children after setting fire to the family home in @entity54			1
his wife @entity55 and accomplice @entity5 were each jailed for 17 years			1
did the benefits system contribute to the @entity89 fire killings ? @entity5 , who had not worked for almost a decade , is said to have enjoyed an income equivalent to that of a £ 100,000 salary as a result of the benefits and earnings of his wife and his lover			1
mr @entity15 faced a ferocious attack from @entity13 and many @entity14 after saying the @entity5 case raised questions about whether the taxpayer should be ‘ subsidising lifestyles like that ’			1
@entity14 president @entity104 described mr @entity15 ’s comments as ‘ incendiary and incredibly stigmatising ’			2
former @entity14 children ’s minister @entity106 said : ‘ i am shocked and appalled that @entity15 has stooped so low as to make a crude political point out of the tragic deaths of six young children			1
’ shameless : former @entity44 minister @entity111 , who filmed a documentary about @entity5 's lifestyle , said she was appalled by a state system which allowed a man to live in this way hated by the nation : @entity5 's infamous appearance on the @entity119 in 2009 when he was roundly criticised for demanding a bigger council house for his expanding brood front - page news : yesterday 's @entity124 on @entity5 's conviction senior @entity14 peer @entity126 even suggested mr @entity15 should consider resigning			1
‘ if @entity15 ca n’t see how wrong it is to play politics with six children ’s deaths he ’s not fit to be chancellor , ’ he said			1
shadow chancellor @entity134 said : ‘ we should have a proper debate about welfare reform			2
but for the chancellor to link this wider debate to this shocking crime is nasty and divisive and demeans his office			0
’ even mr @entity15 ’s @entity14 deputy @entity141 refused to back him yesterday , saying politicians should ‘ let that case lie ’			2
but senior @entity144 believe there is widespread support for further reform of the welfare state – and revulsion at those seen as milking it			0
@entity153 sources said mr @entity1 believed further radical reforms of the welfare system were needed , although these are unlikely before the election because of @entity14 opposition			0
@entity44 mp @entity158 said it was completely legitimate to debate the wider issues raised by the @entity5 case			0
on the attack : @entity13 's @entity164 and shadow work and pensions minister @entity163 have accused @entity15 of acting ' cynically ' he said : ‘ nothing can excuse the individual moral and criminal responsibility for this crime			1
‘ but we would be abdicating our responsibility as a society if we did not look at whether there is some link with the climate of dependency that our bloated welfare system has helped to create			0
’ some @entity13 figures also warned there was a danger that @entity13 would end up on the wrong side of public opinion			0
@entity181 , a former speech writer to @entity182 , said : ‘ the grotesque @entity5 became the stooge embodiment of all that is said to be wrong with a culture in which the idle take the rise out of the working population			0
‘ we may look back on this as the week in which the @entity189 began to speak again to the @entity11 public while the forgetful @entity192 slunk back on to the sofa			0
’ former @entity13 general secretary @entity194 said @entity13 was in danger of becoming the ‘ party of the poor ’ that ‘ does not really care about the middle classes ’			0
the reaction from the opposition front bench was condemned by @entity13 activist and blogger @entity200 , who said mr @entity134 had ‘ plunged ’ into a trap set by the @entity144			0
‘ @entity13 ’s strategy on @entity5 and welfare is suicidal , ’ he said			1
‘ the @entity144 want lots of stories tomorrow that have the phrases “ @entity5 ” , “ welfare ” , and “ @entity13 defends welfare ”			2
they ’re going to get them			0
‘ you do n’t need to be a master strategist to make a monkey of the @entity192 on the issue of welfare			0
@entity13 should back a welfare freeze , in the same way it backs a freeze in public sector wages			0
