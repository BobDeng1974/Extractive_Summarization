deputy mayor : councillor @entity1 has blamed the @entity2 for @entity4 's coin toss councillors in a seaside resort could not decide whether to allow takeaways in a children 's park - so they tossed a coin			1
members of @entity4 voted to ban fast food businesses from @entity12 in @entity13 , @entity14 , after the coin landed on heads instead of tails			1
they have blamed their controversial voting method on the @entity2 , which elected its new leader on a 50/50 spin just weeks ago			1
@entity21 , a former firearms officer , took the helm of the national organisation after a split in the ranks over his appointment was settled by the flip of a coin			1
now , @entity4 's deputy mayor @entity1 , who chairs its place policy development group , has defended its decision to do the same			1
' i opted to use a random method of decision , which was a toss of a coin , ' he said			1
' if you look at election law in a local or general election if the vote is an even split - say 5,000 and 5,000 - the decision has to be made by the presiding officer			1
' they have to decide any method they choose			2
' they can toss a coin or use a short straw or put candidates ’ names in a hat and the one pulled out is counted as an extra vote			0
that ’s a valid and legal way of deciding an election			0
' only two months ago the @entity2 of @entity54 appointed its chairman by the toss of a coin			1
' i thought in my infinite wisdom as a lowly councillor in @entity60 that if this was good enough for the @entity2 and if it is good enough to decide on an mp it was good enough for @entity4			1
' children 's park : councillors voted to ban food takeaways from @entity12 ( pictured ) in @entity13 , @entity14 , after the coin landed on heads			1
their recommendation will now go to @entity60 mayor , @entity70 , for a final decision angry : today , the council 's method of voting was condemned by caterer @entity75 ( pictured ) , who operated her @entity76 at the park last summer			1
she said : ' it just seems like a game to them			0
i think it is unprofessional ' councillor @entity1 said he had been unable to use his casting vote on what was a split decision because he had a personal interest in the issue , as the owner of his own mobile catering firm			0
the four other councillors had been divided over the issue - with @entity92 and @entity93 against takeaways in the park , and @entity96 and @entity97 in favour of them			2
as a last resort , council officer @entity99 had tossed the coin at a private meeting of around 20 councillors , 15 of whom did not have the authority to vote			2
new leader : @entity106 blamed the coin toss on the @entity2 , which elected its new leader , @entity21 ( pictured ) , on a 50/50 spin in may they all watched as it landed on heads - meaning that no takeaways would be allowed in the park			1
their recommendation will now go to @entity60 mayor , @entity70 , who will make a final decision			1
cllr @entity1 said : ' this decision is basically a recommendation to the mayor			1
it is his decision what he does			0
he can either listen to what was said or do something totally different			0
' today , the council 's method of voting was condemned by caterer @entity75 , who ran her @entity76 at @entity12 last summer			1
' it just seems like a game to them , ' she said			0
' i think it is very unprofessional and i feel completely disillusioned			0
' this is no way to treat all the people who supported me last year who really want to see a facility there			0
' cllr @entity1 said the decision to ban food takeaways from park was not aimed at individual businesses			1
but he accepted that the vote - if rubber - stamped by the mayor - may ‘ affect an individual business this year ’			2
last year , ms @entity75 secured a 200 - signature petition to reinstate her airstream van at the park when her trading licence was revoked after her first few days of trading			0
she said she was concerned about competition from @entity152 in nearby @entity153			0
' @entity60 will lose all its parents to @entity152 with its facilities , toilets and play area , ' she said			0
council : cllr @entity1 said he had been unable to vote on what was a split decision because he had a personal interest in the issue			0
the four other councillors had been divided over the matter			0
above , @entity4 ' the council should think about providing a kiosk there with at least one toilet			2
it is an ideal spot			0
' councillor @entity169 , who voted against the proposal , said he did not think the coin toss had been a ' satisfactory way ' of dealing with the matter			2
' i understand where [ @entity106 ] was coming from with a toss of a coin as it is legal , but it makes the council look ludicrous , ' he said			0
councillor @entity97 agreed , saying : ' i think the chairman , knowing he had an interest and could n’t make the decision if it was an even vote , should have handed over the chairmanship to another member of the committee for that item of the agenda only			0
' then no - one would have been put in the position of deciding something on the toss of a coin which is not a good way of making a decision on anything , least of all that			1
' but councillor @entity93 said : ' it is not the most desirable way of dealing with things , but in these circumstances it seemed to be an acceptable way of resolving the situation			0
' the @entity2 came under fire last month after electing its new leader on the flip a coin			1

she also announced that she was scrapping all @entity2 funding this august because the organisation sits on ' vast reserves ' of cash worth tens of millions of pounds			2
the home secretary 's intervention came as a fourth police officer was sacked over the @entity237 ' plebgate ' row involving the former @entity239 chief whip @entity238			0
