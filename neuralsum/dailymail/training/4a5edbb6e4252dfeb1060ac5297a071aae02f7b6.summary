published : 11:11 est , 14 august 2012 updated : 15:01 est , 14 august 2012 most of us are guilty of letting rolls of camera film to languish forgotten in drawers			1
but this camera 's owner surely takes the prize for being the most forgetful photographer			1
atmospheric photos offering a snapshot into life in post-war @entity12 have been discovered on a vintage camera that has survived against the odds for sixty years			1
the find was made by @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity18 , when she snapped up an old @entity20 camera which had been donated to a charity shop in her home town			2
@entity24 moment : one of the photographs from the camera shows this smiling couple peek into the past : @entity16 from @entity17 , @entity18 is desperate to the find the boy in this picture after splashing out a measly £ 3 for the camera , she was intrigued to find it still held an undeveloped film			1
the 23 - year - old took the camera to a local company who warned her that it was highly unlikely that any pictures would even survive the development process			1
but @entity16 was thrilled when she returned to find that six black and white images dating back to the early 1950s had survived			0
although some of the photos from the roll of film were too blurry to see , the six remaining provide a nostalgic flashback of how life was in post @entity12			1
on your bikes ! this surviving picture shows a green and pleasant @entity12 which cyclists enjoyed bucolic : despite being a little blurry , this snap shows what appears to be a village cycling race , watched by keen spectators and what makes @entity16 ’s find even more special is the fact that an undeveloped film left on a camera normally survives a maximum of 20 years before it is rendered useless			1
the pictures feature a couple enjoying a day out in the countryside , smiling as they pose for the picture			2
another image shows a young boy of about eight - most probably the couple ’s son - stood in shorts and a polo neck shirt			2
@entity77 green fields , undisturbed skylines and a village watching a bicycle race portray an idyllic , quiet life - one that is a far cry from the urban lifestyles many lead today			2
the photos were taken in the @entity18 area as one picture shows @entity87			0
now @entity16 hopes that she might be able to trace the young boy who she hopes will still be alive today , believing he would now be retired			1
she said : ' when i took the camera home from the charity shop i saw there was a roll of exposed film so i put it in for developing			1
' the developers were very dubious about whether anything would still be on there and the chap said ‘ i doubt anything will come out due to its age but let ’s give it a go ’			0
one for the album : the rolling hills of @entity12 are showed in this snap , where two cows peacefully chew grass memory lane : one of the old photographs showing @entity87 - a typical @entity113 seaside resort ' i was just interested to see if anything would come out and amazingly six really clear pictures were on there			1
' i do n’t know who was more surprised , me or the man from the shop			0
@entity120 , @entity17 ' in a bid to trace the people in the photos @entity16 posted two of them on @entity126			0
and although no - one has come forward yet , a local historian came back to her to say that the photos , based on the fashions as well as the houses in one of the images , date back to the early 1950s			0
they do n't make them how they used to : emma with her lucky find two of the images show a bike race in action - one with four young men lined up at the start whilst the other is captured mid-race			0
the final photo is of two cows stood in a field			0
@entity16 added : ' the one of the bike race has the most historical information in it because you can see the council homes in the background and can see what people were wearing at the time			0
' but , i am really hoping that the little boy might still be alive today and will get in touch when he sees the pictures , that really would be lovely - he would be into his 60s by now			2
it would be amazing to hear from him			0
' @entity16 , who works as a digital retoucher on modern photos , has a large collection of vintage cameras .			0

@entity170 , green @entity12 captured on camera
owner who found vintage camera wants to trace little boy in the pictures
camera film usually only survives twenty years
