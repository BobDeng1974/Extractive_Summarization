by @entity0 published : 18:48 est , 5 november 2012 updated : 08:55 est , 6 november 2012 hoax : the boy , @entity2 , never existed , and photos posted on a @entity5 page were actually of a young @entity7 cancer victim , pictured when students at a @entity10 high school heard about a nine - year - old boy who was dying from leukemia they wanted to help , raising money and dedicating a football game to the brave youngster			1
but it has since been revealed little ' @entity21 ' never existed and was instead an elaborate hoax a 22 - year - old woman allegedly created to dupe an entire community			1
students at @entity23 in @entity24 thought little @entity2 was battling terminal leukemia , and a special @entity5 page detailing hospital visits and treatments suggested this was the case			1
it all began two weeks ago when @entity30 told colleague , @entity31 , the mother of an @entity23 football player , of the fake child 's ordeal			1
teary - eyed , ms @entity31 offered to get a signed football for ' @entity21 ' who was supposedly a huge football fan			1
' i dragged my son into this and i feel terrible about it , ' ms @entity31 told the @entity42			2
' i just wanted this little boy to be happy if these were his final days			2
' the story quickly spread that the nine - year - old was desperate to see an @entity48 football game , so the school dedicated its october 26 match to the youngster			1
' it was such a big thing to support this little kid that was near death , ' student @entity52 told @entity57			2
the entire student body and the football team - the @entity61 - donned orange to honour the boy , but he never made it			1
students were told he 'd died the day before the big game			1
' the football players had orange socks and orange stickers on their helmets , ' mr @entity52 said			2
' for the dance team , their dance at halftime , they spelled out @entity21 's name on the field			1
' spread : the story quickly spread that the 10 - year - old was desperate to see an @entity48 football game , so the school dedicated its october 26 match to the youngster an obituary appeared in the local newspaper that read : ' out beautiful angel @entity2 lost his two - year battle with leukemia on thursday at the age of 9			1
@entity21 was born in @entity86 to @entity87 and @entity88 on november 2 , 2002			2
he is survived by his brother @entity89 and honorary brother @entity90			0
' but after the no - show , some local residents became suspicious and took the story to @entity94 on friday where investigators quickly determined ' @entity21 ' did n't exist by searching for his death certificate			1
photos of the boy posted on the @entity5 page , which by saturday had more than 1,000 likes , were actually revealed to be a young @entity7 cancer suffer who is still alive			2
they had been stolen from a kids cancer charity website			0
investigators are now questioning ms @entity30 over the made up little boy			1
the students organised a fund raiser for @entity2 but ms @entity30 never asked for money nor she did she receive any , according to the tv station			1
heartfelt response : ' it was such a big thing to support this little kid that was near death , ' said student @entity52 parents like @entity118 were moved by the student 's reaction to the heartbreaking story			0
' this is a very caring , giving community , ' ms @entity118 told @entity57			0
' it 's like family			0
when they hear somebody has a need , they go all out			0
' but the kids feel like they 've been conned			0
' it 's not right			0
i do n't think it 's right for anybody to do that , to even joke about something this big , ' mr @entity52 said			0
' i feel like we were kind of played because everyone was in on it			0
even our principal , he played a big part in it			0
' he added : ' we were trying to think of why she would do it			0
she 's kind of messed up to come up with such a sad story , basically broke the heart of a lot of people			0
' ms @entity118 said she prayed for the person behind the hoax			2
' apparently , she lacks so much in her life that she would do something like this , ' she said .			0

students at @entity23 in @entity10 raised money , made posters and dedicated an entire football game to the fake boy
