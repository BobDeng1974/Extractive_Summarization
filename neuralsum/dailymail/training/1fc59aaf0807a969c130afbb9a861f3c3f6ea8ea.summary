recovery : prices have risen faster than they have done for three years , mortgage lender the @entity5 said today @entity5 's house price graph index graph shows how prices are rising by above four per cent over last summer ( quarterly annual % change along the top ; quarterly year on year price change on the left ) thanks to consumer confidence , prices lifted by 0.9 per cent month on month to reach £ 169,624 on average , marking the sixth monthly rise in a row			1
@entity5 housing economist @entity29 said recent signs of improvement in the economy and increases in employment have helped boost confidence , although activity is still being held back by the squeeze on household budgets			1
he said : ' @entity40 prices are expected to continue to rise gradually through this year , with only modest economic growth and still falling real earnings constraining housing demand and activity			2
' @entity5 ’s report follows similar findings from building society @entity47 last week that the housing market revival is gathering pace			2
lenders , surveyors , estate agents and property websites have all been reporting a strong pick - up in activity following the launch of a government scheme called funding for lending one year ago , which has prompted a big increase in mortgage availability and mortgage providers to slash their rates			0
other initiatives called @entity65 and help to buy have been aimed at giving people with smaller deposits a leg up			0
recent rise : house prices have risen for six months in a row but average house prices to earnings are also on the rise @entity40 sales in the first half of 2013 were six per cent up on the same period last year , according to @entity79 figures			1

just under a third ( 31 per cent ) of trapped renters said they had previously owned their own home but had returned to the rental sector in the tough economy			0
@entity111 , chief executive of mortgage broker @entity112 , said : ' this will be a long , slow recovery			0
' much ground has been lost and transactions and lending levels are running at a fraction of what they were at the height of the housing boom			0
' government schemes such as @entity124 and help to buy are seeing a positive impact though , and we expect this to continue when the mortgage guarantee element of help to buy is introduced in january			0
