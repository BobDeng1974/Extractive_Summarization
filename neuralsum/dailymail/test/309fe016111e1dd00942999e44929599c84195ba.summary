@entity1 manager @entity0 accepts his side are now facing a fight to stay in the @entity5 places			1
city appear to have lost too much ground to @entity8 in the @entity10 title race and their recent form has led to a further worry , with the sides behind them catching fast			1
the fading champions could even find themselves in fourth place before they next play - at @entity16 on monday - if results go against them over the weekend			1
@entity0 ( centre ) shakes hands with @entity21 during @entity1 training @entity23 ( left ) , @entity24 ( centre ) and @entity26 during friday 's session @entity28 ( right ) looks to play a pass as he and his team - mates are put through their paces this is not a battle they envisaged having to fight at the start of the campaign but @entity0 realises nothing can be taken for granted after a frustrating second half of the season			1
@entity0 said : ' i think in this league you can never be sure you are going to have a @entity5 place			1
you have six or seven teams that , from the beginning , all of them play for that position			0
' at the moment , for the whole year , we have been in a position of the @entity5			2
i hope that we will continue			0
' @entity0 believes his side are now in a battle for the @entity5 places and not the title @entity1 have struggled to keep up with @entity8 , who are closing in on the @entity10 trophy the ramifications of dropping out of the top four , however , are not really something @entity0 wants to consider , given that he still has hopes of landing the title			1
with just eight games remaining and a significant deficit to make up on @entity8 that looks a forlorn task , but @entity0 is not giving up			1
the @entity64 said : ' of course if we want to continue in the first position of the table we must not drop any more points			0
it is easy to say but not easy to do it			0
' we just know that from now until the end of the season we will try to win all the games and we will see if we can do it			0
we have to play eight finals from now until the end			0
' @entity78 has found goals hard to come by in recent weeks but will hope to find the net on monday @entity81 is in line to return after withdrawing from the @entity84 squad with a knee problem @entity1 will hope to be at full strength for the trip to @entity88			2
@entity0 reported nothing other than ' small problems ' when asked about any injury concerns at his pre-match press conference			2
that means a likely return for key midfielder @entity95 , who missed the 3 - 0 victory over @entity97 a fortnight ago with an @entity99 problem but has since played for @entity100			0
fellow midfielder @entity81 has also been troubled by a knee problem in recent weeks - and withdrew from @entity84 's midweek friendly in @entity103 - but the issue is not thought serious .			0

@entity0 says his side are in a fight for the @entity5
@entity1 have *slipped* further behind @entity8 in the title race
city travel to @entity112 's @entity16 on monday night
