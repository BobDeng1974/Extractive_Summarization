two years ago , after @entity1 delivered @entity3 ’s first league title since 1968 , this lot took their foot of the gas			1
they coasted through the season , finishing 11 points behind @entity9 in the @entity10			1
@entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 finished them off in group stages of the @entity16			0
those in power at @entity3 vowed that it would never be allowed to happen again			1
they have the mentality of champions			1
just look at the substitutes bench , where @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity26 keep each other company			0
‘ i came here because they are the best team in the country , ’ claimed @entity38 in his first interview with the club ’s matchday programme			0
it is hard to disagree			0
this team look like they mean business , which is just the way we want it after @entity55 opened the season with two victories			0
in the hotseat : @entity20 has put together a @entity3 team who have the mentality of champions it is too early in the season for anyone to start pulling away in the @entity10			1
the hunger is there , underpinned by the brisk and purposeful passing of @entity68 at the heart of @entity3 ’s midfield last night			1
@entity28 midfielders @entity72 and @entity73 , in for @entity74 , never got near him			2
when @entity3 score , as they did 102 times in the @entity10 last season , no - one in the crowd looks at each other agog any more			1
yes , it really is happening			0
when @entity23 follows his opener with goal made from the sweetest of moves , it is normal service			2
last night , at the @entity29 , it was resumed			2
@entity23 was exceptional , providing the classiest moment of the match when his backheeled flick to @entity90 left @entity28 ’s defence flat - footed			1
he scored and @entity3 , who made 19 passes together in the move , felt unstoppable			1
there will be times when it feels routine , particularly for those who criss - cross the country to watch the champions on their travels			2
at @entity103 , on the opening weekend , it felt and looked like they were always in control			0
perhaps they are saving themselves , sparing their legs as they prepare for the 38 game assault on the @entity10 and the travelling that will come with their @entity16 dream			2
pass master : @entity68 , pictured taking on @entity28 's @entity73 , won the midfield battle against the @entity114 exceptional : @entity23 found the back of the net twice in the win over last season 's runners - up @entity28 they have yet to make an impression on the competition , but the draw for the six group games , all played before @entity127 , is on thursday			1
it is time for @entity3 to go deep into the competition after assembling one of the strongest squads in @entity132			2
irrespective of their inexperience at this level , they have to do better			0
@entity3 ’s fans , all 40,000 - plus inside this stadium , operate in real - time these days			1
this team can live with the best now , they proved that with this determined performance against @entity28			1
the @entity139 , the half - baked effort at @entity141 earlier this month where they lost 3 - 0 to @entity142 , has already been forgotten			1
city are only going to get bigger now that they are sitting on two @entity10 titles			0
at the top of the @entity147 , the scaffolding is in place as the club get to work on adding another 6,000 seats to the stadium			0
next summer it will be the turn of the @entity153 for some cosmetic surgery , given a facelift as they plan for the future			0
in the boardroom suite , where the great and good can mingle with chairman @entity160 or club ambassador @entity161 on matchday , they have relaxed the rules			0
suit and tie is out this season , with jeans and smart trainers allowed , even in the posh part			0
on the pitch , they look like the sharpest team in town .			0

@entity68 commanded the midfield and put in yet another top @entity10 performance
