by @entity0 published : 04:27 est , 6 june 2012 updated : 19:25 est , 6 june 2012 @entity2 detectives have reopened their investigation into the murder of a @entity6 student 22 years ago after a tip - off about a new suspect			1
@entity9 was raped , beaten and strangled before her body was left in a river in 1990			2
the 20 - year - old , who was teaching at a @entity2 school as part of her university course , had arranged to meet a man who had answered her newspaper advert offering private @entity20 lessons			1
mystery : @entity9 ( left ) was found raped and strangled in a river in 1990			2
the new investigation will probe convicted killer @entity24 ( right ) and a new , unnamed , suspect the investigation will re-examine evidence against serial killer @entity24 as well as an unnamed new suspect , who is also a convicted murderer and sex attacker			1
yesterday miss @entity31 's father @entity30 , 68 , said : ' we are very pleased			0
they said there are now two strands to the investigation			0
' one is @entity24 and his ex-wife and there are many questions to be answered about that			2
@entity30 and @entity31 are still fighting for justice , 22 years on ' i personally think that they are the strongest suspects			1
the new lead we do n't know much about			0
' all i know is that it is a man who is serving a prison sentence for violent sexual crimes and in the investigations an informant told the police they suspected he was involved in @entity55 's murder			0
' @entity24 , 69 , was nicknamed the ' @entity56 of the @entity57 ' after he lured seven girls , aged between 12 and 21 , to remote spots before strangling , shooting or stabbing them			1
he was convicted in 2008 and is serving life			0
he had been near @entity62 when @entity55 , from @entity63 on @entity64 , @entity65 , was murdered , but attempts to try @entity24 floundered because incriminating evidence from his wife was extracted under duress and police lost vital dna evidence			1
the @entity73 feared any chance of justice for their daughter was lost , but they have been have been given fresh hope by the new development - thought to have been prompted by a tip - off			0
the new suspect has not been named , but he is believed to be - like @entity24 - a convicted murderer			1
the @entity84 family 's lawyer @entity82 said : ' the court has now requested the judges to reinvestigate all aspects of the case including the @entity24 lead and a new lead which has just emerged			2
' this lead concerns another man with a long list of criminal convictions who has been denounced			0
' @entity97 's parents , who have often had the impression of being abandoned by the @entity2 justice system , have renewed hope of finally seeing a result to the inquiry			0

20 - year - old student was beaten , raped and strangled while teaching in @entity2 22 years ago
new suspect is a serial sex killer with a string of convictions
police will also *reexamine* evidence against the ' @entity56 of @entity57 ' @entity24
