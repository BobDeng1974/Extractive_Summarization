by @entity0 published : 14:34 est , 5 january 2013 updated : 14:48 est , 5 january 2013 a @entity2 couple is holding on to hope they may one day be reunited with their curly - haired adopted daughter , whose @entity7 biological father now has custody of the child , after the @entity11 @entity10 announced on friday that it would hear their complex case that involves tribal law			1
@entity15 and @entity16 were overjoyed when they adopted little @entity18 in september 2009 but were dealt a crushing blow when her biological father , who had never met the girl , gained custody of the child by invoking the @entity23 of 1978 , which grants @entity26 parents preference in custody disputes			1
the @entity28 were forced to relinquish custody on @entity30 in 2011 but just one year later are hopeful that the highest court may rule in their favor and return @entity18 to the parents who raised her			1
innocence : after three years with her adoptive parents in @entity2 , little @entity18 was given to her biological father , who had never met the girl happy family : @entity15 and @entity16 , with their adopted daughter @entity18 , were in the delivery room when the child was born in @entity42 in september 2009 @entity43 , @entity18 's birth mother who is not @entity7 , has said that she decided to give the child up for adoption after her relationship with @entity18 's father , @entity47 , ended in april 2009 and she was pregnant with the couple 's child			1
the couple were never married			0
alone and uncertain of her future , the mother thought adoption was the best route and decided on the @entity55 in july 2009			2
@entity56 works as a technician at @entity58 and his wife @entity59 has a doctorate in developmental psychology			0
the pair had tried to have children of their own that included a painful journey of seven unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilization			0
the birth mother , who has supported the adoptive couple throughout the custody battle with @entity47 , said the father relinquished his parental rights via text message			2
but the birth father claims that the girl was conceived when he was engaged to the birth mother but that she broke up with him via text messages			2
though he admits that he did relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support , he said that he never knew his former fianc√©e intended to give the child up for adoption			0
the adoptive couple were in the delivery room when @entity18 was born on september 15 , 2009 and they took the girl from @entity42 to their home in @entity87 , @entity2			1
the adoption was finalized in january 2010 but in the paperwork , the biological father was not reportedly not identified as @entity7			1
though @entity47 signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for adoption , he attorneys later claimed that he did not have a clear understanding of what he had signed and alleged that the birth mother had not fully identified the child 's heritage as an @entity26 to social service workers			1
lawyers for the father say that the @entity103 mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe and thus the father has a right to pursue custody under the claims of the @entity110			2
new home : before @entity18 's birth , @entity47 gave up his parental rights and her mother put her up for adoption fight : the @entity55 have questioned whether it is right for a man - who previously showed no interest in his daughter - take her back simply because he is @entity7 in july 2011 , due to the @entity121 , a @entity2 court ruled that @entity47 had a right to custody of the child , who was 22 - months - old at the time			1
the @entity126 ( @entity121 ) is a federal law established in 1978 to keep @entity26 children with @entity26 families			1
the law came as a response to a high number of children that were being taken from their communities and placed into non @entity7 homes			2
@entity47 , who had never met the girl , came to @entity2 in december 2011 and took @entity18 into his care			1
the @entity55 have not seen her since			0
after a legal battle , the @entity139 ruled in favor of @entity47 in july 2012 even though the court acknowledged the adoptive couple had demonstrated they were ' ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment			0
' a dissenting justice called the ruling a ' human tragedy			0
' ' i profoundly disagree with the majority 's elevation of the @entity23 to a position of total dominance over state law and settled principles of the best interests of the child , ' @entity2 's @entity149 wrote in her opinion last summer			0
missed : the couple that raised the girl since her birth in sep. 2009 have not seen her since dec. 2011 back and forth : lawyers for @entity18 's birth dad , @entity47 , have maintained that he is a good parent and have said the 3 - year - old is happy and healthy in his care following the disappointing ruling in their home state , attorneys for the couple appealed to the @entity11 @entity10 in october 2012 and have gained supporters through their website , @entity174 , where allies can donate to help cover the legal costs			1
in their petition to the high court , attorneys for the adoptive parents lamented the ' bare majority of the @entity139 [ that ] ordered petitioners to surrender custody of the two - year - old daughter			1
' the petition adds that the application of the @entity23 ' has disrupted the lives of children , their parents , extended families , the adoptive parents , and others and has sent a " chilling message " to any couple wishing to adopt a child of @entity7 descent			1
' the attorney general for the @entity197 has said that the intent in applying the law is not to rip a child away from a loving home			0
' we want to make sure those loving home have the opportunity to be @entity26 homes first , ' he told @entity207			0
hopeful : the couple are hoping that the @entity11 @entity10 will allow them to be reunited with their daughter heavy heart : @entity56 weeps over little @entity18 , who he has n't seen since dec. 2011 expectant : the adoptive parents have @entity216 ready and waiting for her as they pray the court will rule in their favor lawyers for @entity47 said the biological father is a good parent and have said @entity18 is ' happy , healthy and thriving ' in her new living situation with her biological father			1
after waiting for months and agonizing over the separation with their child , the couple were overjoyed when the court agreed to hear their case			0
' we are going to the @entity11 @entity10 ! praise @entity232 ! ' they wrote on their @entity235 page on @entity235 , to the more than 8,000 followers of their cause			2
' it has been an extremely difficult year but we now have a renewed sense of faith in our legal system , ' the couple added in a statement			0
' we remain hopeful that our daughter will finally be able to come home and to have a life where she can be surrounded by everyone who loves her			0
there is no way we could have gotten this far without the support from our family , friends and our supporters			0
we are beyond grateful and appreciate the continued prayers			0
' the @entity55 remain in touch with the biological mother , who supports their parental rights , but @entity47 has not allowed them to contact @entity18			2
they told @entity207 that they have had one phone call with the girl since she left in december 2011 and that they told her they love her .			2

@entity15 and @entity16 have raised adoptive daughter @entity18 since her birth in september 2009
biological father , who is @entity7 , wanted nothing to do with her and mother put her up for adoption
he has won custody of the 3 - year - old girl invoking the @entity23 of 1978
