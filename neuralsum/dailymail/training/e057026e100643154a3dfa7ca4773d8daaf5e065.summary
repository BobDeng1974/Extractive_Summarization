lost in thought : a woman sits pensively on the subway , clutching her purse in front of one of the underground maps just another day : two women sit side by side looking off to a corner of the train each sporting 1960s style jackets sailor : this sailor gazes into the camera as he waits for the @entity14 to take him to his desired destination @entity45 made his way back to @entity0 in 1966 as his mother advised him			1

vintage look : the trains of 1966 have a vintage feel when compared to the modern subway system in @entity0 today staples of the past : the photograph shows the types of machines that lined the subway back in 1966 and one could get their horoscope peekaboo : two young boys ride the @entity14 in 1966 just a few years after the @entity127 read the sign : a woman leans against a sign that reads , ' do not stand here ' back in 1966 on a @entity14 platform a moment : this dapper commuter rides @entity0 's subway in 1966 and flashes a curious and confident glance at the camera			2
