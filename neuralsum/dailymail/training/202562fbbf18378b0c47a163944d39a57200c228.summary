these new pictures show the @entity3 's next - generation @entity2 fighter , bristling with fearsome state - of - the - art weaponry			1
however , the deadly - looking weapons are actually trial or ' dummy ' ordnance , which are identical in fit and form to their lethal counterparts but incapable of causing damage			1
a @entity10 test team including personnel from @entity12 , has successfully completed initial aircraft handling trials for @entity15 and @entity16 weapons on the @entity19 aircraft at @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
the ' weapons ' were tested on the short take - off @entity26 ( @entity24 ) @entity2 for the first time during a series of flights from the @entity31 's test facility			1
the flights involved different configurations of both weapons types on the aircraft the ' weapons ' were tested on the @entity47 - off @entity26 ( @entity24 ) @entity2 for the first time during a series of flights from the @entity31 's test facility the initial tests are an important step in integrating weapons onto the @entity2 , allowing test pilots to understand how they affect the way the aircraft performs and handles			1
the planes feature short take - off and vertical landing ( @entity24 ) technology and the latest stealth and intelligence surveillance , target acquisition and reconnaissance ( @entity65 ) technology			0
the @entity3 already uses @entity15 air - to - air missiles and @entity16 - a 500lb weapon capable of taking out a small compound - on its existing combat air fleet			2
the successful tests are a step towards full integration between the current and future fast jets that will be used by the @entity3 and the @entity10 's @entity74 from 2018			2
two @entity34 aircraft , flown by @entity35 , @entity37 's f - 35 test pilot and squadron leader @entity38 from the @entity3 , completed nine flights with @entity78 's @entity15 missiles and @entity80 's @entity16 laser guided bombs			1

the successful tests are a step towards full integration between the current and future fast jets that will be used by the @entity3 and the @entity10 's @entity74 from 2018 the successful tests will be followed by the next stage of weapons testing due to take place in early 2015			1
these tests will involve weapon separation and then guided releases of both @entity15 and @entity16 from the aircraft			0
@entity12 ' lead test pilot for @entity96 , @entity94 , said : ' the team at @entity20 has got over two thousand hours of flying under their belts for the @entity2 variant and the handling and performance of the aircraft has shone through throughout			2
these latest trials were no exception and help us to move confidently into the next phase of weapons testing			2
' @entity108 , @entity37 's vice president for f - 35 test & verification from the @entity96 programme added : ' these trials show the truly international nature of the f - 35 enterprise - being led out of a @entity31 facility , involving a joint @entity10 @entity116 and industry team , working alongside the @entity22 @entity118 and @entity37			1
' and the test results for one partner will benefit all , further demonstrating the versatility and capability of the @entity96 as a multi-role platform			0
' the aircraft were equipped with ' dummy ' @entity16 500lb laser guided bombs			0
file picture deadly effect : an explosion after a @entity16 bomb strike on a @entity132 warship launched from an @entity133 in 2011 @entity10 on monday announced it had signed a contract with @entity22 manufacturer @entity37 to buy the first of 14 @entity2 combat jets			1
the four @entity19 stealth combat aircraft will operate from both of the @entity74 's forthcoming new aircraft carriers and from @entity3 land bases , with another 10 due to be ordered over the next five years			1

' the investment we are making in the f - 35 aircraft will ensure we are securing the skies for decades to come , providing the @entity10 with the latest stealth technology and multi-role aircraft capability , ' said @entity155 , minister for defence equipment support and technology			0
the @entity10 government has long planned to provide its air and naval forces with @entity160 and signed an agreement in principle to buy the four jets last month			0
the @entity96 should have appeared at this year 's @entity164 near @entity165 , but was grounded by technical problems and could not cross the @entity167			0
@entity10 's navy is currently without an aircraft carrier but a new carrier , @entity171 , is due to go into service in 2020 with another , @entity175 @entity174 , to follow .			0

despite their lethal *apearance* , the weapons on the @entity2 are ' dummies ' used for testing
the @entity22 - built fighter needs to be *compatible* with @entity3 's @entity183 weapons
@entity3 has ordered four of the @entity188 fighter , which cost *$* *400billion* to develop and was hit by delays
