residents have been left baffled after bungling council workers put up a 20mph speed limit sign on a footpath			1
the notice was put up by @entity5 in the @entity7 area of the city as part of a £ 147,000 road safety scheme			1
but the sign in @entity12 was placed at a dead end in front of a set of bollards , which enclose a pedestrian - only zone in the residential area			1
a @entity5 worker removes the 20mph sign that was put up in error at the end of a footpath @entity28 , 89 , who has lived in the area all her life , said : ‘ it ’s bizarre , you can barely even get a bicycle through the gap in those bollards never mind a car			1
‘ the sign is actually on the pavement , it ’s not like it ’s a few yards before , there would be no chance to get up to speed before you hit the bollards			2
‘ i know we old dears can hit some speed in our mobility scooters but this is taking it a bit too far			0
’ another resident , @entity46 , 54 , said : ‘ i ca n’t believe it , i do n’t think it ’s the only place they have done something stupid like this either			0
a woman with a pushchair walks past the pedestrian zone in @entity12 where the sign was put up a man inspects the bizarre location choice for the sign after residents call the error ' daft ' and ' not needed ' ‘ it cost money to put that up too , and it will never make any kind of difference			1
‘ what will they do next ? install a speed camera to make sure we do n’t run too fast ? ’ @entity70 , 26 , who also lives nearby , said : ‘ it ’s a bit daft			0
‘ you would have thought people would have common sense and not put the sign up with the bollards right there			2
’ a footpath is not the only place where residents claim a sign is not needed			2
another street nearby has a 20mph sign attached to a lamppost - but it is just a 45 metre stretch			0
@entity88 , 27 , added : ‘ it ’s impossible to go that quick on these streets anyway , so what ’s the point of the signs ? ’ a spokeswoman from @entity5 said the sign was put up in error and it has now been removed a @entity5 spokeswoman confirmed the @entity12 sign was erected in error and said it has now been removed			1
she said : ‘ the scheme is still under construction and so the checks to pick up on issues like this are yet to be carried out			0
‘ changes like this are implemented before speed limit orders come into effect			0
‘ 20mph limits are being introduced in residential areas across the city and have been shown to bring a number of benefits , such as reduced traffic noise , safer junctions and improved air quality			0
