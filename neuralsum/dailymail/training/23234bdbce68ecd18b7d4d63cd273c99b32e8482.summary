by @entity0 published : 08:02 est , 1 november 2012 updated : 02:43 est , 2 november 2012 parents at a primary school are up in arms over a plan to send pupils home at lunchtime every friday to let teachers catch up on paperwork			1
the move would mean children losing the equivalent of 16 days of education every year			1
families are furious at the threat to their youngsters ’ schooling , and also the prospect of having to pay for extra childcare			0
controversial : @entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity20 , proposes to close on friday afternoons so teachers can catch up on paperwork from january , the 355 pupils at @entity24 in @entity19 , @entity20 , will be sent home at lunchtime every friday			1
more than 100 parents gathered at the school this week to voice their anger at the plans			2
@entity31 : the school says teachers need the time for planning , preparation and assessment ( posed by model ) mother - of - one @entity38 , 38 , said : ‘ this is not just parents having a moan about nothing			1
this is a vitally important issue			0
‘ we asked if the teachers would be giving up 16 days of the summer holidays to make up for the 16 days of teaching the children will be losing			1
we did not get an answer			0
’ schools have a legal requirement to ensure that all teachers are given planning , preparation and assessment time during the day to help with their workload			1
but rather than spread this time out across the week , the head at @entity24 decided that grouping the time together for one afternoon a week ‘ will ensure that the children get the best out of their education ’			1
parents , however , say the proposals are simply a way for teachers to start their weekends early			1
they added that many parents who also have children at a nearby affiliated infants ’ school would be faced with the inconvenience of two separate school runs every friday afternoon			1
on wednesday evening , more than 100 parents assembled at the school for a meeting about the plans , with those in attendance claiming 95 per cent of parents were against them			2
one father , a 40 - year - old banking consultant from @entity77 , @entity20 , said : ‘ you could describe the atmosphere as spicy			1
there were some very angry people in there			0
’ @entity83 , 36 , who has one daughter at the school , added : ‘ my daughter will start to lose part of her education			2
‘ they said they will provide help for parents who work , but only if both parents work			2
because i work part - time , i ’ll be excluded			2
’ another mother who was at the meeting said : ‘ it ’s interesting the school chose a friday afternoon to close			0
why not a mid-week day ? ‘ a lot of the staff are young and a lot of parents think it ’s an excuse to let the staff have an extended weekend			0
’ parents also gathered at the school gates yesterday morning to complain			0
@entity104 , 38 , whose son @entity105 , eight , goes to the school , said : ‘ it seems like a stupid idea to me			0
how can they take away half a day ’s education like this ? ‘ i could n’t go to the meeting because of when they scheduled it			0
they have already said they are getting teachers in early , at 8.30am to do this paperwork , so what has changed ? if they need more time to do it they need to come in earlier			2
’ mother - of - two @entity123 added : ‘ the simple thing is the teachers can not be bothered to teach them and do their paperwork			0
they are just destroying our children ’s education			2
’ ' @entity133 priority ' : the school claims the move would improve the education of their pupils the half - day closing measure comes just months after teachers were criticised in an @entity141 report for failing the most able pupils at the school			1
a spokesman for the school said no decision had been finalised regarding closing early on fridays			0
in a letter to parents , head teacher @entity145 said : ‘ we can assure you that the children ’s education is the number one priority and we believe that this method will ensure that the children get the best out of their education			1
’ a spokesman for @entity156 said : ‘ this is ultimately a school decision , with the board of governors making a final decision			0
‘ wednesday ’s meeting with parents was part of a broader consultation on the possibility of altering the school day			0
‘ there is a legal requirement for teachers to be given time to plan lessons			1
any proposal would still ensure that pupils are taught for the legally required amount of time per week			0

@entity18 , in @entity19 , @entity20 , claims teachers need the time to plan and prepare their classes
parents argue cut in teaching time will impact *quality* of children *'s* education
