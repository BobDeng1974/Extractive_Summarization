@entity0 announced fuel duty had been frozen for the fifth year in a row fuel duty has been frozen for a fifth year in succession , allowing the chancellor to boast that motorists have had ‘ £ 10 off a tank with the @entity7 ’			1
yesterday ’s move means a 0.54p - per - litre duty rise planned for september 1 will not go ahead			1
and the freezing of duty over the five years of the @entity12 means the average driver spends £ 10 less per fill - up than if the controversial ‘ fuel - price escalator ’ had been implemented in full			1
between 2011 and 2016 , a typical motorist will have saved £ 675 , the @entity15 calculated			1
the planned fuel duty rise by the @entity19 rate of inflation on september 2015 would have increased the current duty rate by 0.54p per litre – from the current 57.95p to 58.49p			1
for an average family car fill - up of 55 litres , this would have increased the cost by 30p			1
mr @entity0 said he had cancelled the fuel duty rise because ‘ i want to help families with the cost of filling up a car ’			1
he added : ‘ it ’s a cost that bears heavily on small businesses too			2
it ’s the longest duty freeze in over 20 years			0
it saves a family around £ 10 every time they fill up their car			1
that ’s £ 10 off a tank with the @entity7			0
’ motoring groups welcomed the policy and urged any future government ‘ not to step back on the escalator ’			0
the @entity42 said the above - inflation fuel duty ‘ escalator ’ that operated between 1993 and 1999 ‘ is the primary reason that we now pay nearly 70 per cent in tax on every litre of fuel we buy at the pumps ’			1
@entity51 president @entity50 said : ‘ the @entity12 has done its “ fuel duty ” by shielding drivers from some of the impact of volatile fuel prices over the past four years by freezing fuel duty , and we welcome the further freeze and cancellation of the scheduled fuel duty rise for september 2015			1
‘ with petrol and diesel prices surging and falling by more than 35p a litre since 2010 , the continued four - year fuel duty freeze allows the @entity12 to dodge the fuel - protest bullet			1
’ @entity67 , of the @entity69 campaign , welcomed the freeze but said the chancellor should have gone further and cut duty			0
the move means a 0.54p - per - litre duty rise planned for september 1 will not go ahead , which for an average family car fill - up of 55 litres , would have increased the cost by 30p he added : ‘ we give mr @entity0 six out of ten for endeavour and will continue to campaign that duty should be frozen for the lifetime of the next @entity81			1
’ @entity42 director professor @entity82 said : ‘ with fuel duty revenue making up about 5 per cent of the @entity15 ’s tax income there was never going to be a huge giveaway as the chancellor still desperately needs motorists ’ money			1
’ he added : ‘ but with the latest figures showing that almost a million of the poorest households see a quarter of what they spend go on buying and running a car the continued freeze is very welcome			0
’ @entity97 and @entity98 , pictured with their two children @entity101 , 6 , and @entity102 , 1 , will save £ 50 a month on fuel @entity97 and @entity98 will save £ 600 a year thanks to the fuel duty freeze			1
the couple , who use their cars for commuting and taking six - year - old @entity101 and one - year - old @entity102 to school and nursery , drive a combined 1,500 miles a month			0
mr @entity98 , an it manager , spends two hours a day making his 35 - mile commute in rush hour			0
filling up his 2.7 - litre @entity112 every week costs him £ 280 a month			1
mrs @entity113 , a maths teacher , spends another £ 70 a month on fuel for her @entity115			2
yesterday @entity0 delayed an increase in fuel duty once again – meaning drivers are nearly £ 10 better off every time they fill up their car than they would have been had @entity124 ’s ‘ fuel - price escalator ’ still been operating			1
this saves the family , pictured , about £ 50 a month			2
mr @entity98 said : ‘ the extra money we save will be a nice little boost and we can spend more on the kids			0
’ company cars take a clobbering @entity132 attacks his @entity133 in show @entity135 and @entity135 's 1975 @entity136 the classic car to which @entity132 administered ‘ a damned good thrashing ’ is now exempt from road tax			2
the character played by @entity142 actor @entity141 famously took a tree branch to a red @entity133 estate in frustration after it broke down on him in the 1970s comedy series @entity147			0
but now it has reached an age where the government no longer requires @entity151 to be paid			0
also newly exempt is the red 1975 @entity136 – with its trademark stripe – as used and rolled over by @entity154 tv cops @entity135 , played by actor and singer @entity156 and @entity157 in the popular 1970s crime - fighting series			0
@entity159 , senior tax manager at @entity162 accountants @entity160 , said : ‘ an exemption from @entity151 for vehicles constructed 40 or more years ago was introduced in april 2014			0
‘ this exemption applies automatically on a rolling basis on 1 april each year			0
‘ so next month all cars made before 1 january 1976 will be exempt from the duty			0
’ he added : ‘ this includes the 1975 @entity136 used in @entity135 and the @entity133 estate famously thrashed by @entity132 in 1975 ’			0
the majority of drivers with company cars will be hundreds of pounds worse off after the chancellor moved to make the work perk ‘ greener ’			0
the tax levied on the majority of company cars will be increased by three percentage points in 2019 - 20			2
the rate for environmentally - friendly vehicles will also rise – but at a ‘ slower rate ’			1
city accountants said the changes are unfair on company car drivers locked into three or four - year deals who chose a cheaper vehicle ‘ in good faith ’ – only to have it re-classified months later as a gas - guzzler , and taxed accordingly			2
the government ’s avowed aim of the changing tax rates for the ‘ benefit in kind ’ is to push company car drivers into greener vehicles – such as fully electric or hybrid cars , which carry a smaller tax burden			0
this has fuelled a boom in low - tax ‘ plug - in ’ hybrid vehicles , which can be charged from the mains but also run on conventional fuel			2
the tax on these so - called ‘ ultra-low - emissions vehicles – or @entity218 – is still rising too			0
however , the chancellor is at pains to point out that it is rising at a ‘ slower ’ rate because he is increasing the gap between the tax on the cleanest ‘ green ’ cars and the conventionally - fuelled alternatives			2
@entity0 told @entity219 : ‘ to encourage a new generation of low - emission vehicles we will increase their company car tax more slowly than previously planned			1
’ @entity224 of accountants @entity160 stressed that because most company car drivers are signed up to three or four - year deals , they will be penalised for choices made well before the changes were introduced			2
‘ it ’s effectively a retrospective tax on cars , ’ he said			0
‘ many employees with company cars will be locked into long term deals and will have no choice but to bear the ever - increasing cost of company car tax			1
’ ‘ having previously introduced an annual two - percentage - point increase in the rate of company car benefit in kind to 2018/19 , today @entity0 announced a further annual hike of three percentage points from 2019/20			1
this announcement will see the benefit in kind rate increase by nearly 50 per cent in the period to 2019/20			0
‘ for example , the benefit in kind rate on [ a car emitting 100 grams of carbon per kilometre ] will increase from 19 per cent next tax year to 28 per cent by 2019/20			2
‘ the changes mean a driver paying the 40p tax rate with a £ 28,000 1.6 - litre @entity256 provided by their employer will be £ 1,008 worse off after five years , with a ‘ benefit in kind ’ tax bill of £ 3,360			1
someone with a @entity115 worth £ 28,000 will also see their tax increase by £ 1,008 , to a total of £ 3,472			0
an executive with a £ 38,000 @entity266 will pay £ 1,368 more , taking their annual bill to £ 4,712 , while anyone with an £ 81,000 three - litre @entity270 as their company car will be nearly £ 2,600 worse off , with an annual bill of £ 11,998			1
however , taxes on green cars mean the driver of a top - selling £ 28,304 @entity277 hybrid will also see their company car tax treble – rising by £ 1,245 to £ 1,811 a year			1
tax on a £ 32,000 @entity281 hybrid will rise by £ 1,408 to £ 2,028 by 2019 - 20			1
@entity282 will become a world - leader in the development of driverless cars thanks to a £ 100million boost from the chancellor			2
the figure will be matched by private - sector funding for a total pot of £ 200million			2
the announcement was welcomed by @entity292 , which hailed a policy that will ‘ help create the smarter and more connected cars of the future ’			0
two driverless car pilot schemes are already under way in @entity298 and @entity299			0
much of the technology – from automatic parking to radars that scan for pedestrians or cyclists and can slam on the brakes – already exist in the latest cars on the road			0
however , new research is aimed at making driverless cars both safe and socially acceptable .			0

move means a 0.54p - per - litre duty rise planned for september is cancelled
planned rise by @entity19 rate of inflation would have gone from 57.95p to 58.49p
for average family car of 55 litres , this would have increased cost by 30p
@entity0 cancelled fuel duty rise to ' help families with filling up '
it 's *believed* between 2011 and 2016 , a typical motorist will have saved £ 675
