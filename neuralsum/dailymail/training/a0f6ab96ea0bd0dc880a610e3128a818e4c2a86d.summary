@entity3 has shown slight signs of improvement , 94 days after being placed in an artificial coma , his manager has said			1
@entity6 said the 45 - year - old @entity8 ace , who has been sedated since his skiing accident at the @entity11 resort of @entity12 in december last year , will not be confined to a vegetative state for the rest of his life			2
his family is said to be planing to build a custom multi-million pound mini-clinic to care for him , but not in the home he shares with @entity21 , as previously reported , but in the house of his father @entity23			2
new hope : @entity3 's manager last week said the @entity8 driver has shown ' encouraging signs ' of improvement ‘ i can only repeat there are signs that give us encouragement , ’ said @entity29 , claiming unending ‘ negative ’ reports that doctors fear he will be condemned to life as a vegetable are untrue			1
‘ family , friends and doctors are optimistic , ’ said @entity39 , without elaborating on where the optimism comes from			0
earlier this week it was said that his wife @entity21 is planning on spending £ 10million on building a fully equipped medical suite on their vast family estate in @entity51 , although new reports say it will be built at his father 's home			1
even though @entity58 , 45 , has been told by doctors it is highly unlikely the racing ace will ever wake up from his medically induced coma , she has decided to use the family 's £ 500million fortune to build the facility in their lavish £ 25million estate on the banks of @entity69 , @entity51			1
today is the three month anniversary of the @entity72 skiing accident where the seven - time @entity8 champion , 45 , hit his head and was put into an induced coma to reduce brain swelling			1
bring him home : reports had claimed that @entity21 planned to build a multi-million pound facility so her husband can leave hospital , but these were subsequently denied by family and friends of the former @entity8 ace successful : the £ 25million estate on the shores of @entity69 where the @entity3 family live since then , there have been few encouraging signs of recovery and the racing ace has been wasting away in his hospital bed , losing 25 per cent of his body mass to now only weigh 8st 7lbs			1
a friend of the @entity3 's , who has known the family for 25 years said : ' miracles happen , of course , and as a wealthy man he has the best care money can buy			1
' but all the money in the world can not fix what has happened to him			0
the family are making arrangements for a future of permanent immobility			2
' is there a sense of denial at play among them ? i would say yes , ' the friend told the @entity117 the family 's life has been taken over by the accident , every day they make the 150 - mile round trip from their home in @entity51 to the @entity125 , @entity11 , where @entity3 is receiving the best possible care			1
they spend up to ten hours by his bedside , offering up prayers for his recovery , before returning home in the evening			0
mrs @entity58 has always been a devoted wife , extremely supportive of her husband 's career			0
mr @entity3 once said : ' it is not so easy to find a partner who unconditionally adapts to the pace of my life			2
' both growing up in the same region of @entity140 , @entity3 and @entity58 met at a party in 1991 and fell in love			2
the pact that has seen their loving relationship endure is that she allows him pursue his high - octane career and , in return , he would give her everything she could want			0
@entity153 skier : thrill - seeker @entity3 had been a keen and skilled skier before his accident in december waiting : the @entity125 , where @entity3 has been in an induced coma for three months loving support : @entity21 arrives at the hospital to which she and family make a daily 150 - mile round trip with an accumulated wealth estimated to be well over half - a - billion pounds , @entity3 's family is well placed to provide the limitless care that will be needed in the coming years			1
this will include physiotherapists , to massage his atrophying joints , doctors , nutritionists , nurses and neurological experts			0
he used the staggering fortunes from his 22 - year career to snap up a ranch in @entity174 , where @entity21 raises horses , as well as apartments and ski chalets around the world - including the one in @entity12 from which he set out on the tragic day late last year			0
he even built the estate on @entity69 where the new medical facility will be installed			1
as a result , mrs @entity58 refuses to give up on the man she once described as the ' perfect partner '			0
the family friend told @entity117 she ' would view breaking faith with the hope of a miracle a betrayal , little better than treachery			0
' she feels that the family communes around his bedside pulsate their hope and love to him , and that of the millions of fans worldwide who share that faith			0
' she ca n’t express defeat because that would be the end of her			0

@entity3 is showing slight ' encouraging ' improvements , manager says
despite grim *prognosis* , the seven - time @entity8 champion 's family will not give up
family is set to build a £ 10m medical facility to care for @entity3
the family are currently making 150 - mile round trip to his bedside daily
