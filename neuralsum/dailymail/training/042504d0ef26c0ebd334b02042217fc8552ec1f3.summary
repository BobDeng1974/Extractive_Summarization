by @entity0 published : 09:29 est , 25 december 2012 updated : 18:29 est , 25 december 2012 the father of a student blinded in one eye in an unprovoked attack by a teenager yesterday condemned police for letting him go with just a telling - off			1
the latest shocking example of ‘ soft justice ’ occurred after @entity9 , 20 , intervened to protect a female friend who was being verbally abused by a gang of teens			1
one lashed out at him , resulting in horrific injuries which caused his right eyeball to deflate			2
despite a five - hour operation involving 170 stitches , his sight could not be restored , and he may lose the eyeball altogether			1
furious : @entity9 was blinded in his right eye during the attack but the perpetrator was let off with a caution but because police and doctors were initially unaware of the severity of @entity9 ’s injuries , his 16 - year - old attacker was let off with a reprimand – a youth caution which means he was n’t even given a criminal record			1
the let - off emerged days after figures revealed that more than 500,000 criminals have been given cautions for serious crimes – including almost 8,000 violent assaults – in the past 15 years			0
that is despite the lord chief justice , director of public prosecutions and @entity43 all expressing concern at the number of out - of - court penalties being issued by police			1
as @entity9 told yesterday how the assault had ruined his life , his landscape gardener father @entity47 , 45 , said he felt betrayed			1
bloodied : @entity9 said police initially thought he only suffered cuts and bruises in the attack ‘ i ’ve got no respect for what the police have done			1
i got a £ 60 fine for having the spacing on my private registration plate wrong			0
' yet this lad has left my son blind in one eye and gets off scot - free			1
where ’s the justice in that ? @entity9 will now be affected for the rest of his life			2
’ @entity9 , who is studying environmental management at university in @entity69 , was attacked last august after going for drinks with friends			2
‘ as we got out on to the street we noticed around 50 teens , ’ he said			0
‘ one started shouting abuse to my friend ’s girlfriend and i quietly told him to “ leave her alone ”			0
‘ he carried on being aggressive , so i told him to “ leave it ”			0
he squared up to me , screaming in my face and then i felt an almighty blow to my eyebrow			0
’ @entity9 was taken to hospital where his injuries – at first thought to be merely a cut eyebrow – were photographed			2
he said : ‘ i did n’t think it was anything serious , especially when i was sent home			0
’ the next day , his doctor covered his left eye and asked him to read from a board			0
‘ i said “ what board ? ” and he looked into my eye and said , “ oh dear ”			0
@entity96 and i broke down			0
i ’d always said going blind would be the worst thing			0
@entity9 , who lives in @entity98 , @entity99 , with his father , mother @entity101 and sister kate , 16 , added : ‘ i ’m shaking with rage that more is n’t being done to get justice in this matter			1
’ a police spokesman said : ‘ we are aware that ( @entity9 ’s ) eyesight has since begun to deteriorate , and we are reviewing the case with the @entity111			2
’ deflated : doctors discovered a haemorrhage in @entity9 's eye and a tear meant it had no pressure and was deflating surgery : @entity9 needed 170 stitches in his eye to stop it deflating @entity9 was hit outside @entity121 with two @entity122 in @entity123 ( pictured ) which has now closed			1

@entity9 , 20 , from @entity123 , @entity99 , was hit outside a pub
he needed 170 stitches in his right eyeball to stop it collapsing
he will never regain vision in the eye and is now registered disabled
@entity9 said his 16 - year - old attacker should have gone to court
