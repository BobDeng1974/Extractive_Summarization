by @entity0 miracle : @entity2 , 22 , and her fiance @entity3 were saved by an anonymous benefactor a woman whose car was stolen and trashed with her $ 1,800 wedding dress inside has been saved in time for the big day – after an anonymous ‘ angel ’ bought her a new gown			1
@entity2 , 22 , was devastated after her @entity10 turned up in an alleyway with the all - lace gown missing in her home town of @entity14			1
several women offered her their gowns after the crime appeared in her local newspaper , but the search seemed hopeless because none would fit @entity21 ’ 5ft 1in frame			1
she put down a $ 400 deposit on a new gown , but could not afford the balance because she used all her spare cash fixing her trashed car			2
that was until a miracle struck at the bridal shop			1
@entity32 , the manager phoned @entity2 to tell her a ‘ wedding angel ’ had paid the $ 1,400 cost of an identical gown			1
@entity21 – who still has no idea who the mystery woman was – joked she would be sleeping with the dress every night until the big day in june			1
she told today : ‘ she said that she had amazing news and that someone had come in and anonymously paid off my dress			2
‘ i just started crying			0
they do n’t even know me , and it was a wonderful thing to do			0
‘ i ’m so , so grateful			0
if i can find her , she can come to the wedding			0
’ @entity21 had received the original gown as a gift from two aunts and chose it because it reminded her of the one her late grandmother wore 60 years earlier			0
she and fiancé @entity3 scoured pawn shops in the hope the dress had been traded , but to this day it has not turned up			2
saviour : the mystery woman donated $ 1,400 at @entity59 's @entity58 in @entity14 , pictured it is far from the first wedding miracle			1
in february a newlywed couple in @entity63 survived a 30ft tree toppling onto their car as they drove from their wedding ceremony to the reception			0
@entity70 , 36 , and his new wife @entity71 , 40 , were driving away from the wedding in fierce winds in their @entity74 when the car buckled under the force of the blow			0
miraculously the pair only suffered minor injuries - while @entity70 ’s two children @entity80 , seven , and @entity82 , five , and their dog @entity84 , walked away completely unharmed .			0
