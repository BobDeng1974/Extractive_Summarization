@entity0 will have a metaphorical target on his back at this week 's @entity3 in the same way @entity5 did in his heyday , according to @entity8 legend @entity7			1
@entity7 , the triumphant captain at @entity9 in 2010 and a giant of the competition during his playing appearances , believes all 12 members of the @entity15 team will relish the chance of claiming @entity0 's scalp if they are drawn against the @entity19 and @entity15 @entity20 champion in the foursomes , fourballs or singles matches			1
the @entity24 was the first player spotted on the driving range at @entity27 on monday morning , clearly looking to get his game into the best shape well in advance of the start of the three - day competition on friday			1
@entity8 team - mates @entity0 and @entity35 fist bump on the driving range on monday morning @entity0 was the only player spotted practising early on monday morning on the driving range at @entity27 the world no 1 gets in the swing in @entity41 ahead of golf 's biennial showpiece the @entity19 and @entity15 @entity20 champion moved on to hitting his driver later in the practice session @entity0 was soon joined by @entity35 , with whom he enjoyed a morale - boosting fist bump , and later @entity49 , who warmed up in the chilly @entity41 air with a hot cup of coffee			1
@entity0 told @entity53 5live : ' i arrived here yesterday evening and hit some balls last night , i just wanted to get here a bit early and make sure i am prepared for friday			1
it 's been a long stretch ( of golf ) for me			0
" i just wanted to try and take as much time as i could off and get away from the game a little bit but obviously excited about this week			0
it will be good to meet up with all the team later this evening and i think once that happens i think we will all get into the spirit of it and be really excited			0
' @entity0 was seen working hard on his swing , and the four - time major champion and world @entity70 looks ready to prove his status as the game 's brightest star this week			1
but @entity7 had a warning for the 25 - year - old ulsterman			2
' @entity0 is the one player that @entity15 wants to play because they 've nothing to lose , ' the 51 - year - old @entity78 told the @entity81			1
' it was a bit like that for us against @entity5			0
when we did draw him we would say " @entity86 on , i 've got a chance here			0
if he beats me he 's supposed to beat me , if he does n't , well , what a day for me and what a day for the team			2
" ' @entity7 , who featured in eight @entity92 as a player , said @entity8 captain @entity94 may be tempted to ' hide ' @entity0 in the opening foursomes or fourballs on friday and saturday			1
the @entity19 and @entity15 @entity20 champion tucks into a snack , while standing next to his @entity8 branded golf bag @entity49 was the next @entity8 player to turn up and he seemed to enjoy a story @entity0 was telling @entity101 star @entity49 hits a drive on the far left side of the range under the gaze of his caddie and coach vice-captain @entity108 ( left ) wrapped up warm ( in september ) , while @entity49 ( right ) drank coffee ' i think a lot of pressure is on @entity0 's shoulders , ' explained the eight - times order of merit winner			1
' if the rest of the team see @entity0 winning it gives them confidence			2
' if the team see @entity0 losing in one of the first groups then it 's difficult to think ' we 've got to pick up the pieces ' so it 's a huge temptation to hide him away			2
' you do n't want to put your main star out at no 1 because the rookies in the @entity15 team can play and any one of them can score a 66 and win , ' said @entity7 who is @entity8 's third highest @entity3 points scorer of all time with 23 1/2			1
' i would definitely be for hiding @entity0 the way @entity5 was many times			2
we expected him at no 1 in the singles in 2006 for instance when @entity15 were well down at the @entity140 and he turned up at @entity141			2
' @entity0 's last competitive outing saw him battling for a Â£ 7million payday in the @entity144 , but he is equally fired up by the thought of playing for team glory at the @entity3			1
he famously labelled the @entity3 as an ' exhibition ' the year before his debut in 2010 , but contributing to narrow victories at @entity9 and @entity150 means he appreciates the special nature of the biennial contest			0
@entity0 works on hitting his irons in @entity154 ahead of the @entity15 team 's arrival ' it 's a group of people that you know well and they all have one goal , one collective task which is to win the @entity3 and beat the @entity15 team , ' @entity0 told @entity163			1
' the money does n't matter to us any more , it does n't matter if we 're playing for millions of pounds all over the world			0
this means as much to us or even more than any other thing that we play for			0
it 's a big deal to us , we want to play as well as we can and try to win			0
' i arrived here yesterday evening and hit some balls last night , i just wanted to get here a bit early and make sure i am prepared for friday			0
it 's been a long stretch ( of golf ) for me			0
' i just wanted to try and take as much time as i could off and get away from the game a little bit but obviously excited about this week			0
it will be good to meet up with all the team later this evening and i think once that happens i think we will all get into the spirit of it and be really excited			0
