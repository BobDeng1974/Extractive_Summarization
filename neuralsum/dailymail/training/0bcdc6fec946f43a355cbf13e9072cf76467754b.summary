that is why i just ca n't let it go			0

mr @entity112 , 40 , of @entity116 , said : ' there was evidence from @entity7 's family and friends about @entity5 's background that was never heard during her trial			1

' @entity7 was gone and it was all my fault			2
' @entity7 said that before the incident she managed to get her ' alcoholic ' partner ' into the back seat ' with help from her son			2
' after giving him a very good talking to , i dropped him off outside his house , ' she told the court			0
' but instead of going inside , he started staggering slowly in front of the car and refusing to move out of the way , so i had no option but to drive slowly behind him to get to the end of the narrow street			0
' the road was dark as it was winter , but i could clearly see him in front of the car bonnet and he stumbled slightly then disappeared			0
mr @entity7 pictured with his sister @entity160 - she says the sentence given to @entity5 is ' disgusting ' ' i quickly did an emergency stop and looked at my son in a panic			1
i tried to reverse and , when the car would n't move , i realised @entity7 was under the car			1
' i am a qualified nurse but i panicked when i saw him lying there			0
' he was my husband and i loved him and when i took his hand and held it , i knew he was dead			0
' during the trial , @entity7 's lawyer , @entity169 , said : ' this incident is something that is going to live with her for the rest of her life			1
' sheriff @entity83 also told the hearing : ' this is a tragic case			0
she was careless , that is the bottom line , but i am not going to send her to jail			0
this is a very long and tragic case which has gone on for years			0
' it is very sad			0
' he added : ' i do not want to upset you			0
i am not going to send you to jail			0
you were careless and it had a terrible consequence			0
' there needs to be an element of punishment for what took place			0
now , you can put it behind you			0
' mrs @entity26 said she struggles to comprehend why the sheriff said he did not want to upset her son 's ex. she said : ' how can the sheriff tell her not to get upset and that he would n't jail her ? ' i was furious with what he said , taking pity on @entity7 's ex but totally overlooking the feelings of his family			1
' mrs @entity26 said ' i have been left without my son and we want to see justice for what happened to him ' the procurator fiscal 's office last night explained it ' has a limited right of appeal against sentence '			2
a spokesman added that for an appeal against sentence to be successful , it must be outside the range of sentencing options which could be imposed			0
sentences for causing death by careless driving can range from ordering a re-test to five years ' imprisonment			2
the spokesman said it would therefore be ' inappropriate ' for the procurator fiscal to appeal against @entity5 's sentence			1
' we will be contacting mr @entity7 's next - of - kin to explain the reasons for this decision to them , ' he said .			1
