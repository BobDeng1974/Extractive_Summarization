so how does she do it ? ' i do n't know ! , ' she told @entity1			0
' a very understanding husband maybe and a lot of will power to get up early to work out			2
i do a lot of my projects at night when the kids are asleep			0
it 's a balancing act			0
i do n't have nannies or family nearby but we make it work			2

' it 's all a balancing act with maintenance , if you ’re good 70 per cent of the time you should enjoy the other 30 per cent			0
