likely @entity1 presidential contender @entity0 takes a swipe at @entity3 and @entity4 in his new book , calling out the hip - hop duo for their on - stage sexual gyrations and explicit lyrics , and slams the @entity10 for their close relationship with the a-list couple			1
' how can it be that the @entity10 let @entity18 and @entity10 listen to that trash ? ' the onetime @entity16 governor - turned - @entity14 host asks			1
' ' @entity4 is incredibly talented – gifted , in fact , ' the former baptist minister writes			1
' she has an exceptional set of pipes and can actually sing			0
she is a terrific dancer – without the explicit moves best left for the privacy of her bedroom			0
' but that 's where the love-fest ends in the book ' @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34			1
he last ran in 2008 , winning the @entity64 caucuses and five super tuesday primaries before conceding the @entity1 nomination to @entity68 sen. @entity67			1
@entity0 's weekend @entity14 show has positioned him as a conservative culture warrior who may find it difficult to attract an audience in an increasingly secular @entity73			1
and nowhere in his book is the culture war between the coasts and ' flyover country ' more present than in his backhand dismissals of @entity3 and @entity4			1
the music video for ' @entity53 , ' the song @entity0 criticizes in his book , includes explicit lyrics and images of a sultry @entity4 strutting on a beach ' from husband to @entity87 ' : @entity3 makes an appearance in the ' drunk in @entity91 ' video , rapping ' slip the panties right to the side / @entity93 n't got the time to take drawers off ' as his wife dances seductively the pair headlined the @entity54 , opening the broadcast with a performance of their hit ' drunk in @entity91			1
' @entity0 calls it a ' song ' – air quotes included			1
' @entity4 must have been confused , ' he writes , ' when she agreed to humiliate herself by performing in a way that prompted this comment from author @entity108 ( whose book when did ' @entity110 ? ' says it all ) : " honestly , i did n't want to watch @entity3 and @entity4 's foreplay "			1
' @entity0 's latest culture - war book hits shelves on january 20 ' the song contains words and imagery so graphic that they would never make it through the editing process of this book			1
( not that i would want them to ! ) but the onstage gyrations , bare flesh , and ( most of ) the lyrics did make it onto @entity127 , again during the smoldering remnants of what used to be the " family hour "			0
' @entity4 's rap lyrics in ' @entity53 ' include ' i get filthy when that liquor get into me			1
' her husband enters the song halfway through , intoning about ' foreplay in the foyer / f * * * ed up my @entity138			0
' ' slip the panties right to the side , ' @entity3 continues in the wildly popular track			0
' @entity93 n't got the time to take drawers off			0
' the song 's video has been played a stunning 245 million times on @entity147 , treating viewers to repeated shots of @entity4 gyrating in a swimsuit and swapping lines with @entity3 about their sex life			2
@entity4 , @entity0 reflects , ' was a huge , breakout star before going x-rated			1
she proved she does n't need to lower herself to this type of crude exploitation to be a megastar			0
' ' she must know that millions of young girls look up to her as a role model to emulate			0
and she even has a daughter herself now			0
so why has she done this ? ' first lady @entity161 is a close @entity4 friend , taking @entity18 , her younger daughter , to a concert in july			2
the singer serenaded the first couple as they danced at their first inaugural ball , and performed @entity73 's national anthem at president @entity169 's second inauguration			2
she later admitted she had lip - synched the patriotic song			0
' that trash ' : @entity4 performed onstage at the 2014 @entity172 at @entity173 in @entity174 , @entity175 @entity16 gov. @entity0 was a force to be reckoned with in 2008 , winning the @entity178 and five super tuesday primaries before conceding the @entity1 presidential nomination to sen. @entity67 but @entity4 has been to the @entity183 numerous times with @entity3 and remains close to the @entity10			1
she was the star attraction at the first lady 's 50th birthday party a year ago , and the a-listers hosted a fundraiser for the president in 2012			2
in a december 2013 @entity191 interview , the president said that both of his daughters have ' gotten to know @entity4 , and she has always been very sweet to them			1
' he told @entity195 in a softball 2012 interview that he and the first lady ' do n't constrain ' the music elder daughter @entity10 listens to			2
' we expect her to show some good judgment			0
' ' we actually share tastes in hip - hop and rap music , ' the president added , ' but we do n’t listen to it together , because some of the language in there would embarrass me – at least while i ’m listening to it with her			1
' ' folks like @entity3 , @entity214 , we both like them , but when it comes on and i ’m sitting with her and @entity18 , then i fast - forward because it would make me blush			0
the important thing is for him not to be embarrassed , ' he snarks in the book			0
' it 's no small wonder why the culture has become so crude when fathers and mothers allow and even encourage their children to devour vulgar , misogynistic , and violent material when it 's performed by " cool " people like @entity3 and @entity4			2
' ' with the first lady so concerned about making sure her daughters ' bellies do n't ingest unhealthy food , how can she let their brains ingest obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics ? if lived out , those lyrics would be far more devastating to someone 's health than a cupcake			2
' @entity244 ? an image apparently showing @entity10 , 16 , wearing a t - shirt for hip hop collective @entity247 was shared on @entity249 by the group , which claimed a ' mutual friend ' gave them the image @entity254 : @entity0 writes that @entity4 ' does n't need to lower herself to this type of crude exploitation to be a megastar ' @entity4 is close to the first family , performing at inaugurations and headlining @entity161 's 50th birthday party in january 2014 @entity10 attracted attention this month when the hip - hop collective @entity247 posted a photo on @entity249 in which she appeared to be wearing a $ 40 t - shirt emblazoned with their logo			1
the first daughter 's picture was shared online just days after one of @entity247 's founding members was arrested for breaking a security guard 's nose at a concert in @entity274			0
the @entity183 is investigating how the photo of the elder @entity169 daughter found its way to the group			0
@entity0 signed off from his eponymous @entity14 news show on january 3 , announcing that it would be the last episode			1
he is expected to make a final decision about whether or not to join the presidential race in the coming months			0
his first stop will be in the state where he first cruised to victory eight years ago : @entity0 is scheduled to speak at the @entity287 on january 23			2
' @entity32 , @entity288 ' also includes a chapter about the indignities of airport searches at the hands of the @entity293 – titled ' @entity294 and take it like a @entity295 ! ' ' where else would i be ordered to stand still , put up my hands , and have my personal belongings taken and searched without a warrant or probable cause ? ' he asks , referring to his frequent commercial airline flights			2
' after years of this indignity , much of the flying public thinks little of it , and they usually do n't complain			0
they just dutifully stand there , bend over , and take it like a prisoner			0
