ever since man embarked on his ceaseless quest for knowledge , there have been questions that do n’t really need answers			0
but yesterday some of the finest minds of science , engineering and craftsmanship combined to examine one of them anyway : precisely how useless is a chocolate teapot ? would it turn into a steaming , molten splodge as soon as boiling water was introduced ? would n’t the spout just go floppy and prevent the tea being poured ? and surely the brew would taste like a cross between day - old hot choc and recycled canal water ? useful at last ! a team of scientists and engineers have created a fully - functioning chocolate teapot ( pictured ) that can brew tea for two minutes without completely melting all these imponderables faced a specialist team at @entity30 when the corporation set about trying to determine the effectiveness or otherwise of a mythical piece of culinary equipment that has become part of modern @entity37 usage as an insult ( to wit : ‘ he ’s as useful as a chocolate teapot ’ )			1
it took six weeks of planning , countless equations and several failed prototypes before master chocolatier @entity46 and his team at the @entity49 in @entity50 were ready to craft the perfect teapot from chocolate			1
the moment of truth : scientists settled on using dark chocolate with 65 per cent chocolate solids , due to its fat content			1
here , @entity60 presenter @entity59 pours hot water into the chocolate teapot chocolate ingredients determine the material 's heat resistance and its melting point			1
chocolatiers are interested in the science of chocolate to influence how it tastes and feels in the mouth			0
the melting point is typically just above 36 ° c so it melts in the mouth , according to @entity73			1
if the melting point is very high , the mixture will feel waxy			1
if it is too low , it does n't store well and separates			0
first decision : milk or plain ? they opted for dark chocolate with a 65 per cent cocoa content , the logic being that it contained the best fat composition to stay solid			1
and in any case , it tastes rather good			0
then a pukka - looking teapot , short and stout , was crafted in a silicone mould			2
the pot had a large opening at the lid to let the initial waft of steam escape quickly , and a hand - hollowed spout			2
the manufacturing process took just over two and a half hours			0
and then it was time for tea			0
filmed by a crew from @entity101 ’s @entity60 , presenter @entity59 poured freshly boiled water into the pot and added a couple of teabags			1
the good news : it did n’t immediately melt			0
as the tea brewed for the requisite two minutes , mr @entity46 reflected on the challenge and admitted : ‘ we thought we would probably end up with chocolate tea			2
’ but he added : ‘ interestingly , if you pour the water in a certain way and you do n’t stir inside , the chocolate on the inside of the shell melts but does n’t move anywhere			0
so you get a very , very small amount of residue coming up to the top			0
’ in a moment of great triumph , the tea was poured into a cup and sampled			0
verdict : it tasted like tea , with a hint of chocolate			2
now … where ’s that inflatable dartboard ? tasting the final brew , the team concluded it was a good cup of tea with a slight hint of chocolate			2
the scientists built up a series of layers using a silicon mould to create the teapot in a process that took around two hours			1
the finished product ( pictured ) has a large lid and very thick spout			1

teapot was created by scientists and engineers at the @entity150 in @entity50
scientists used dark chocolate with a higher melting point that was built up in layers inside a silicon mould , to make the chocolate teapot
design features a large whole and lid , plus a very thick chocolate spout
it was tested for an *episode* of the @entity101 's @entity60 where it did n't melt
the teapot *unsurprisingly* produced a cup of tea with a ' hint of chocolate '
