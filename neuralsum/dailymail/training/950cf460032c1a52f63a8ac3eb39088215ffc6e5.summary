it 's a jungle out there			2
particularly when you are shaping up to be today 's ' special ' on the waterhole lunch menu			1
in an astonishing video shot on the @entity6 savanna , a pack of seriously hungry jackals and a lone crocodile lurking just below the water 's surface , have cornered a warthog			1
now , if you are the prey in this particular scenario - dish of the day for some of animal kingdom 's most vicious predators - you already know there is no escape			1
a little warthog drinks at a watering hole on the @entity6 savanna unaware of the jackals who are stalking him for lunch			1
but they are n't the only predators in town the jackals are already licking their lips at the prospect of warthog , served extremely rare			1
but the crocodile in the @entity35 video seems almost casual to the point of disinterest			1
both sets of hunters have an enviable strike rate in this situation , even though crocodiles eat very rarely and jackals tend to hunt alone or in pairs			2
jackals , carnivores with dog - like features and a bushy tail , tend to live singly or in pairs , only coming together to hunt in small packs			2
they have a reputation for being opportunistic , skulking scavengers and would have no problem taking down a warthog			0
crocodiles are amazingly fast when they want to be - swimming at 20mph to catch prey			0
they use their powerful jaws and teeth to crush their meals , often tearing animals apart in chunks or swallowing them whole			0
what 's on the menu today ? warthog for the pack on the left			1
but who is this showing up to the party on the right ? never underestimate a crocodile @entity74 : jackals : warthogs are a species of wild pig , who in spite of their ferocious appearance , are omnivorous , eating grasses , roots , fruits , bark , fungi and insects			2
its the the only species of pig that has adapted to grazing in the savanna habitat			0
far from fighting , it would rather run away from trouble - at speeds of up to 30mph - than attack			0
which is a bit unfortunate for our poor warthog in this home movie			0
caught between the bank and the water , he had no place to go			0
so who bagged it for lunch ? it was the crocodile of course			2
leaving some very disappointed jackals yelping on the sidelines			0
the crocodile finally makes its move , lunging forward with its tail and hind legs , jaws open , to grab the warthog the disappointed jackals can only look on as the crocodile pulls the warthog down with its powerful jaws and drags the prey off for lunch			1
the ' dish of the day ' is off guys			0

amazing video of warthog being stalked by @entity6 's *sneakiest* predators
the prey was *destined* to be lunch for either the crocodile or the jackals
but the *outcome* was anyone 's guess
