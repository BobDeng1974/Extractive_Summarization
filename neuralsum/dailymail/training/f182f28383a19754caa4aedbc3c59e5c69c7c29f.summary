by @entity0 published : 13:40 est , 24 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:23 est , 24 february 2014 nearly 70 - years ago , they were laid in the sand to stop the @entity5 invading from the west			1
now the tank traps built to protect @entity8 from @entity10 's @entity9 have been uncovered on a beach after sand was washed away by the storms			1
the metal structures , built using a mixture of heavy chains and disused railway track , were exposed on a beach in @entity19 , @entity20			1
discovered : the tank traps were uncovered on rest @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity20 in the aftermath of the storms that have swept the country the traps , several feet high , were set in 1940 when the country feared that @entity8 might be invaded after @entity29			1
they were part of a long coastal line of barricades to prevent enemy tanks from moving inland if they successfully reached the shores			2
@entity19 historian @entity37 , who remembers the tank defences from when he was a child , said they were still visible until 1946 or 1947			1
he said : ' they were chains and old railway lines which were embedded upright in the beach			2
they would have been around six or seven feet above the level of the beach			0
' i can remember them stretching from @entity48 all the way round to @entity19			1
tough : the historic fortifications are made of chains and old railway lines barricades : they formed part of an enormous line of coastal defences to prevent tanks from advancing inland ' they were then cut down at some point after the war but even then , i remember going swimming in @entity48 and catching my toe on them - it could be pretty painful			1
' a number of tank defences were built in @entity67 , nine of which formed the backbone of the @entity70 defence			0
it was developed in 1940 and 11 of the barricades used rivers as their backbones			0
many were used to protect approaches by enemies into the @entity78 from places such as the @entity80 and the @entity22			0
however the main threat stemmed from the @entity82			0
@entity8 feared the country , which was neutral at the time , could provide a launching point for the @entity87 forces			1
those in @entity20 were also used to guard against the flourishing mining communities which included the coal fields and industrial belt			1
concrete obstacles , which can still be seen today , were the main defensive lines set up on beaches			0
anti-aircraft poles and wire obstacles were also used			0
around 30 beaches were said to have had the defences installed			0
council workmen will start digging them up and removing them this week after local beach walkers at @entity19 complained they were a dangerous hazard			1
local @entity102 took photos of the remains of about a dozen traps and posted them on @entity106 to warn surfers and other beach users			2
he said yesterday : ' the council cut them back quite a few years ago but they are exposed now more than ever			0
' they have been visible since the first storm back in january - it surprises me nothing 's been done about it because they are so dangerous			0
' a @entity119 council spokesperson said highways workers would be taking a digger to the beach to remove the traps			2
crews and machinery had been deployed elsewhere to tackle storm damage and the council had also been waiting for the sand on the beach to settle			2
' about nine ' @entity132 explosives have been washed up on a beach in @entity134 following recent storms , @entity130 have said			1
they have been on the beach for nearly 70 years , but cause a problem for swimmers who can catch themselves on it line : the defences extended along the @entity67 coast , all the way along to @entity145 in @entity146 base : the defences were built eight miles away from @entity149 ( picture during @entity132 ) which was an armament training centre for the @entity152 engulfed : enormous waves caused by the high winds hit @entity155 while storms battered @entity8 coast lines controlled explosions : ' about nine ' @entity132 explosives were washed up on a beach in @entity161 , @entity134 remains : last week , 100 miles up the @entity67 coast in @entity164 , an ancient forest thought to be 6,000 years old was uncovered by the storms experts from the @entity168 carried out controlled explosions on the anti-aircraft shells at @entity161 at about 09:45 gmt. they were called in by coastguards , after a man walking on the beach on sunday morning spotted the explosives			1
they were identified as anti-aircraft shells by the navy experts			0
@entity130 said the shells , which were corroded but still live , were found at low water at @entity181 channel , about half a mile away from @entity161 seafront			0
