this week it was revealed that teachers are currently using training packs which suggest sex as young as 13 is ‘ normal			1
’ the ‘ traffic light tool ’ which was sent out to schools up and down the country by sexual health advice service @entity4 also suggests that masturbation and kissing are ok between children as young as nine			1
but how does losing your virginity at 13 really affect you ? we spoke to one woman , who wished to remain anonymous , who said that it was one of the worst things that could ever have happened to her			1
she said : ‘ i lost my virginity at the age of 13			2
at the time i had an 18 - year - old boyfriend who i thought was the epitome of cool because he used to pick me up from school on his motorbike			0
‘ we were together , on and off , for almost three years in the end , and i always used to describe him as my first love			0
‘ that was , until i grew up and fell in real , adult love , and realised that all i ever had with him was a case of extreme infatuation			2
’ the woman - who was outraged when @entity52 bought the ‘ traffic light tool ’ to the public ’s attention - explained that the sex was planned and that she was on the pill at the time			2
‘ i definitely did n't have sex because all my friends were doing it , and it was n't really a social - climbing exercise either , but i did want my boyfriend to stay with me			2
' however , that did n't stop her riding an emotional roller coaster that she feels she would have been better equipped for had she not been so young			2
‘ when we did , inevitably , split up on numerous occasions the emotional fallout was unprecedented			0
i would weep for days in my room , refuse to eat and obsess over whichever girl it was that he 'd dumped me for that time			0
‘ it was unhealthy and borderline unhinged , but then , i was only 13 years old			0
’ having heard the latest news she is adamant that young children should not be taught that sex at such a young age is normal			1
‘ i have a 15 - year - old niece now , and she 's still such a child in my eyes			0
the idea of an older man convincing her to have sex with him makes my blood boil , and she 's two whole years older than i was when i was doing just that			0
the age of consent varies massively around the world , from 13 to 20 ... ‘ my mum knew about what i was doing at the time and whilst i do n’t blame her entirely i do wish she 'd tried to reason with me , perhaps told me that i did n't need to have sex with a boy to keep him interested			1
' our case study says that having sex so young skewed the way she viewed relationships			1
‘ being in an intimate relationship at such a young age definitely made me see sex in the wrong way			1
‘ for many years after i broke up with my first boyfriend , i did n't have much self - respect and slept with quite a few people that i wish i had n't			0
‘ i was simply not emotionally mature enough to deal with a sexual relationship and , while i do n't necessarily regret the person i chose to lose it with , i do 100 per cent regret doing it so soon			1
’ she went on to say , ‘ children should definitely not be taught that sex at 13 is normal			1
the age of consent is in place for a reason			0
‘ i think it would be good to be taught more about the emotional side of a sexual relationship as well as just the mechanics and scaremongering			1
‘ yes , you might get an sti or even pregnant , but what about the psychological damage to your young teenage mind			0
‘ it 's a tough enough time already without adding those woes to the list			0
children should be allowed and encouraged to stay young for as long as possible – we 're all growing up far too fast these days			2
‘ save sex for the right person and the right time			0
’ the @entity132 ' states that for children as yoiung as 13 ' green behaviour ' includes ' consenting oral and / or penetrative sex '			1
