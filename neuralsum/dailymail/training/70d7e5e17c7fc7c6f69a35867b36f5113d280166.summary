the greatest prize in club football , the @entity3 , returns for another glorious season on tuesday and as ever there 's so much to look forward to			1
the biggest teams and the biggest stars going head - to - head in the biggest stadiums for the biggest prize on the continent			0
there really is nothing better			0
here 's 10 reasons why we ca n't wait for the return of @entity18 's top competition this week			1
who will succeed @entity20 as champions of @entity18 this season ? 1			1
the return of @entity24 it 's been a long five years away for @entity24 and their captain @entity26 admitted to feeling ' jealousy ' as rivals @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 took on the cream of @entity18			1
but the wait is finally over and the strains of the iconic @entity3 anthem will once again ring out at @entity36 ahead of their match with @entity38 on tuesday			2
for a club with such a proud @entity41 pedigree as @entity24 , being away from the @entity3 really hurt and they 'll be desperate to make up for lost time			1
@entity24 captain @entity26 limbers up as he prepares to lead @entity24 back into the @entity3 @entity26 lifts the @entity3 after @entity24 's memorable comeback win in @entity44 in 2005 @entity45 is set to lead the @entity24 line against @entity38 on tuesday night @entity47 has a bold and exciting team to unleash , with @entity45 leading the line ahead of the likes of @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 ( when he returns from suspension )			1
there are few things more stirring in football than a big @entity41 night at @entity36 and they will be worth the wait			0
@entity62 's @entity61 core take on @entity18 while @entity24 are making a return , @entity62 are mainstays in the @entity3 , about to embark on their 17th consecutive season			1
they begin with a tricky trip to @entity67 and wo n't be helped by a defensive injury crsis that sees them without @entity70 , @entity71 and possibly @entity72			0
@entity73 is preparing to lead @entity62 in the @entity3 for the 17th successive season @entity62 will be without right - back @entity70 for their trip to @entity67 on tuesday ( left to right ) @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity72 and @entity80 form part of @entity62 's @entity82 core as they chase glory in the @entity3 but they do boast a wonderfully creative attack , with the likes of @entity87 , @entity77 , @entity80 and @entity78 flying the flag for @entity61 talent			1
throw in @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 and the @entity93 should have the firepower to cause plenty of problems			0
they take on @entity67 , @entity98 and @entity99 in their group			0
@entity31 aiming to go one better it was a case of so near and yet so far for @entity31 as they were beaten by @entity103 in last season 's semi-finals			2
the lack of a deadly goalscorer proved the downfall of @entity110 's team , but this time it 's all very different			0
@entity111 helped @entity103 to victory over @entity31 in last season 's @entity3 semi-finals but now @entity111 is showing excellent form for @entity31 following his £ 32m summer move @entity111 has scored seven goals in four @entity118 matches since his £ 32m move from @entity103 and if he can translate that form into @entity41 competition , there 's no reason why @entity31 ca n't repeat their 2012 triumph			1
@entity31 start their campaign at home to @entity128 on wednesday and a group that also contains @entity130 and @entity131 should n't cause too many problems			2
champions @entity30 with a point to prove they may have won two @entity118 titles out of three but @entity30 have n't yet been able to translate domestic dominance into @entity41 success			2
when they are confronted with one of the established names , they have struggled			0
last season , it was @entity145			2
the year before it was @entity20 and @entity67			2
the year before that @entity147			2
@entity148 and @entity145 proved the downfall of @entity30 in last season 's last 16 tie city need star striker @entity153 to deliver the goals if they are to improve in the @entity3 and as a result , they once again find themselves in a tough group with @entity147 , @entity159 and @entity160 , travelling to the @entity161 first up on wednesday			1
it 's time for @entity30 to perform and get to the latter stages and they undoubtedly have the quality to get there			2
@entity20 's @entity166 they ended an agonising 12 - year wait for a @entity3 crown last season and now @entity20 are hungry for more			1
having secured the much - coveted @entity171 triumph on an unforgettable night in @entity172 back in may , @entity20 start their pursuit of @entity174 at home to @entity176 on tuesday night			0
@entity177 celebrates scoring @entity20 's fourth goal in the 4 - 1 final win over @entity103 in may new galactico @entity180 celebrates with @entity177 during the @entity20 derby with @entity103 they look an even more formidable proposition this time round , with @entity180 and @entity185 the latest @entity186 to join @entity177 , @entity187 and @entity188			1
it 's actually been quote a shaky start to the season for @entity193 's men , with league defeats already to @entity195 and @entity103			0
they will hope the @entity3 will provide the kick - start they need			2
@entity145 's awesome forward line @entity145 also have the @entity3 firmly in their sights having strengthened their attacking options with the purchase of @entity202			1
as we all know , @entity202 wo n't be available until the matchday four trip to @entity206 but his goalscoring talents could prove the difference between success and failure in the latter stages			0
@entity145 's new star signing @entity202 will be available from matchday four onwards @entity213 and @entity148 celebrate a goal in @entity145 's win over @entity216 at the weekend however with their midfield packed with plenty of @entity3 nous and @entity148 and @entity213 up front , @entity145 have plenty to go on			1
they start their quest for a first @entity3 title since 2011 when they play @entity225 on wednesday , with two tantalising games with @entity227 to come			0
@entity147 's stars on top of the world having been embarrassed by @entity20 in last season 's semi-finals , @entity147 find themselves with something to prove on the @entity41 stage			1
but at least their @entity236 stars have that winning feeling - @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 helped win the @entity243 over the summer			0
@entity147 's @entity239 lifts the @entity243 for @entity244 during the summer @entity242 will once again offer a potent goalscoring threat for @entity147 in the @entity3 @entity246 is seeking to win his third @entity3 as a coach with genuine challenges likely to be few and far between in their domestic league , @entity147 will set their sights on @entity41 glory and they have an amazing team			1
@entity246 already has two @entity3 wins as a manager - he 'd dearly like to make it three			0
familiar faces the @entity3 is a constellation of stars and many of them we know very well from the @entity118			0
former @entity31 and @entity261 manager @entity260 will be leading @entity262 into action against @entity264 , @entity265 and @entity266 in @entity267 @entity268 will spearhead the @entity265 attack on their return to the @entity3 for the first time since 2005 - 2006			1
and @entity30 will come up against a familiar foe in @entity273 when they take on @entity159			0
@entity260 is in charge of @entity262 for this season 's @entity3 campaign @entity268 will be up front for @entity265 as they make their return to the @entity3 @entity273 will line up for @entity159 , who have been paired in the same group as @entity30 9			1
the minnows the elite invariably grab the headlines in the @entity3 but let 's not forget some of the lesser lights taking part			0
nobody could have scripted @entity38 ' qualification play - off victory over @entity289 as defender @entity290 donned the goalkeeper 's gloves to make two vital saves in a penalty shoot - out and secure their progress			0
@entity296 @entity225 will visit @entity145 , @entity227 and @entity206 as they compete in the @entity3 group phase for only the second time , while @entity130 of @entity299 are also making their second appearance at this stage			1
@entity290 was the penalty - saving hero for @entity38 in their play - off win over @entity289 10			0
it is the best of football whoever 's playing , the @entity3 is a byword for top quality football and unmissable drama			2
the competition throws the world 's biggest clubs and world class stars week - in week - out and it 's wonderful to have it back again .			0

the @entity3 returns this week as group stage gets *underway*
@entity24 return to the top table after five years away as @entity45 prepares to lead their line
@entity62 hope strong @entity61 core will guide them to latter stages
@entity111 will offer @entity31 extra firepower as they target glory
@entity30 seeking to improve on *disappointing* early exits
@entity20 to unleash formidable @entity186 team on @entity18 as they bid to retain their crown
@entity145 and @entity147 again amongst the favourites
