by @entity0 will @entity1 be playing for @entity2 or @entity3 at the @entity4 in @entity5 ? will the @entity7 elite like @entity8 be happy sharing rooms in the @entity10 ? will players wear the @entity13 cap when so many have lucrative deals in place with other manufacturers ? will all the caddies turn up for nothing ? just some of the questions that are now the responsibility of the man who beat more than 40 other applicants to be named manager of @entity2 when golf re-enters the @entity27 fold in two years ’ time			1
and so when he was n’t overseeing the startling short game improvements he ’s instilled in @entity30 , or practising his own game for the @entity32 , @entity28 was wandering up and down the driving range in @entity34 last week and making people aware of his new posting			1
@entity5 , here we come : @entity28 has landed the plum job of @entity2 's golf manager for the @entity4 lean on me : @entity1 talks to his fiance , @entity41 , after losing out in @entity34 on sunday big decision : @entity1 must choose whether to represent @entity43 or @entity3 at the @entity27 in two years we may as well start with the toughest question of all			1
how well does he know @entity47 and is he intent on a bit of arm - wrestling ? ‘ who would n’t love to have @entity47 in his team ? ’ he said , smiling			2
‘ i will certainly be talking to him , that is for sure			2
but i think we all respect the incredibly difficult position he is in , and that this is a decision that has to come from him			2
as i said , i ’d be the first to welcome him if he does decide to play for us , but i ’ll also be the first to wish him all the best if he plays for @entity3			1
’ the 50 - year - old @entity60 confesses to being a little nervous as to the reaction of players used to all possible creature comforts being asked to ‘ rough ’ it in the @entity10			1
‘ there is some talk of a hotel , to be honest , but if i was a player who had made this team i ’d want to embrace the whole experience , ’ he said			1
‘ but will our top players feel the same way ? in fact , are they interested in playing in the @entity27 at all , with everything else going on in the crowded golf calendar ? those are the sort of conversations i will be having over the next few months			1
’ heard the one about staying in a shared room , @entity81 ? @entity82 could be in line for the @entity84 party time : the @entity27 is heading to @entity5 in 2016 when golf will be played at the @entity84 one good thing about golf being back in the @entity27 is the welcome boost it will surely give the women 's game			1
‘ i think that ’s going to be one of the really nice things about the job , ’ said @entity28			1
‘ it ’s a real chance for the leading @entity7 women to put themselves on the wider sporting map and i ’m looking forward to doing what i can to help			2
’ the selection criteria has yet to be finalised but is expected to be based on the world rankings , with @entity28 likely to be in charge of an eight - strong team of four men and four women , competing in two 72 hole events			1
he has been encouraged by the initial reaction			2
‘ the caddies have been telling me how much they ’re looking forward to it , even though they wo n’t be paid , and i have had a good response from the players i have spoken to so far , ’ he said			1
as an ex-chairman of the tournament players ’ committee , and a former tour winner in his own right , @entity28 is certainly amply qualified			1
let ’s hope the stars give him the support he deserves			2
@entity119 a villa on the market for £ 4million in @entity34 comes with one unique selling point : a round of golf with the owner			1
given the seller just happens to be the current @entity128 champion , it ’s not a bad marketing ploy			2
the villa next to @entity132 golf course was bought by @entity133 in 2008 , and comes with all the luxury items you would expect plus two maid ’s rooms and , naturally enough , ‘ a room for the driver			1
’ that ’s the human variety , presumably			2
despite owning it for six years , @entity119 has never lived in it			2
who has a house worth £ 4m and never uses it ? @entity145 once said the top golfers are now so rich they live like movie stars and here ’s another example			0
c'mon @entity150 : @entity133 is the reigning @entity133 champion following his unforgettable triumph last april room with a view : @entity119 's @entity156 villa is up for sale for a cool £ 4m ... but includes a round of golf it 's a hard knock life : the @entity133 champion has never actually lived in his @entity34 mansion @entity163 's girl set to make a splash @entity163 is giving the @entity165 a miss this week in order to attend the latest edition of the less than highbrow television show splash on @entity170 on saturday night			1
@entity163 ’s glamorous fiancée , television presenter @entity171 , is among the contestants			1
‘ i ’m not allowed to talk about what dive she is going to do but i can promise it will be spectacular , ’ says @entity163 , whose own career has come out of a rather spectacular nose dive since hooking up with fearless @entity175			1
driver and diver : @entity163 ( left ) and his glamourous tv presenter girlfriend , @entity171 ( right ) sorry @entity182 , but yours was not the shot of the @entity185 hate to be so arrogant as to tell 63 per cent of voters they went for the wrong man , but let ’s have a bash , shall we ? in a recent poll on the @entity195 ’s website , that many people declared @entity197 ’s prodigious blow on the 18th hole in the @entity199 in @entity200 last november as their shot of the year for 2013 ( click here to watch the shot )			1
true , it was a real crowd - pleaser , finishing inches from the hole for a tap - in eagle			0
but shot of the year ? @entity197 was so far ahead he had already won the tournament			0
he admitted afterwards he actually pulled the shot , which is why it flirted with danger before finishing so close			0
poll - winner : @entity197 was back in action at the @entity212 last week a far better blow was surely @entity214 ’s on the 18th at the @entity215			0
not only was the tournament on the line , his whole career had practically been preparation for the four iron he simply had to pull off			0
so much at stake then , but the ball never left the flag for a second			0
ok , it finished 30ft away			0
but the only reason it did n’t finish as close as @entity197 ’s shot in @entity200 is they do n’t have soft greens at the @entity232			0
the @entity234 gent was a deserved winner of many awards last year			0
but he should n’t have won this one			0
moment of a lifetime : @entity214 hits his laser - guided four iron from the 18th fairway at @entity242 final series solution is no closer no 1 : @entity197 claimed glory in the @entity195 's race to @entity200 last year but not everybody was happy with the @entity248 schedule members of the @entity195 ’s players committee were specifically told not to comment on matters that went on during their meeting in @entity34 last week			1
but my sources tell me a good deal of the meeting was spent talking about what changes , if any , to make to the structure of the tour ’s @entity248			1
this , you will recall , was the four event series that closed out the season , comprising two events in @entity264 , one in @entity265 and the last one in @entity200			0
many of the top players were unhappy at being made to play in two of the first three at the end of a long season in order to qualify for the grand finale			2
rebels like @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 simply downed tools , and so did n’t make it to the grand climax in the @entity281 which , in turn , left the sponsors of the @entity199 feeling slightly short - changed			0
so what ’s the solution ? is it right the top players should call all the shots and be free to play where they choose ? or do you protect the interests of four big - money sponsors by insisting the superstars show some commitment and responsibility ? it ’s easy to see the argument from both sides and so not surprisingly , after much debate , the matter went unresolved , with officials left to go away and try to come up with a halfway house that keeps everyone happy			2
quote of the week ‘ it ’s still @entity304 , and he proved the perfect replacement			0
they ’re brother and sister and their demeanour is the same			0
they do n’t get too high and never get too low			0
’ as far as @entity313 @entity312 is concerned , there ’s nothing like keeping it in the family			0
when his wife , who caddies for him , became pregnant , @entity304 turned to his brother - in - law @entity318 to carry the bag – and you could say it worked , as he completed a comfortable victory in the @entity323 on the @entity324 on sunday			0
two years ago @entity304 was outside the world ’s top 1,200			0
now the 23 - year - old rising star is inside the all - important top 50			0
happy family : @entity312 and wife @entity330 celebrate his victory in the @entity323 climbed the mountain : @entity304 hits from the 13th tee on the @entity335 private course at @entity336			0
