the @entity7 compared insurance data for the 2009 - 2011 model years and found @entity2 occupants filed personal injury claims 28.5 times for every 1,000 of the vehicles the industry insured			1
the car with the best safety rate using the same measurement was the @entity19 sports car , which had only 4.5 injury claims for every 1,000			1
unwanted achievement : the @entity2 had a higher rate of personal injury claims than any other car , according to the @entity7 safest auto ? the @entity19 had the lowest rate of personal injury claims - only 4.5 claims per 1,000 insured vehicles ‘ @entity2 is committed to achieving the highest standards for safety and is proud of its industry - leading 18 @entity2 , @entity34 and @entity35 models , including the @entity2 , named 2012 ‘ @entity37 ’ by the @entity38 , ’ @entity2 spokesman @entity29 told the @entity30			1
the institute said its research clearly demonstrated that the vehicles with the highest injury claims tend to be small cars , while also proving an important alternative to the crash tests conducted by federal safety regulators and the insurance industry			1
‘ injury claims data shows something that crash test results ca n’t , and that ’s the role that vehicle size plays , ’ said @entity48 , @entity7 senior vice president			1
‘ in most crash tests , the advantage of greater size and weight is masked by using a fixed barrier [ in a test ]			0
as a result , crash test results are comparable only among similar vehicles			0
’ these numbers demonstrate which vehicles ' occupants are the most likely to be injured in when it comes to real crashes , the institute said			2
‘ we know that in the real world , if all else is equal , a larger , heavier vehicle does a better job protecting occupants than a smaller , lighter one , ’ @entity48 said			1
the @entity76 , a small crossover , had the second - highest risk of injury to its occupants , posting 26.6 claims per 1,000 insured vehicle years			1
the @entity76 crossover had the second - highest injury claim rate : 26.6 per 1,000 @entity85 the @entity87 subcompact had the third - worst record , logging 26 injury claims per 1,000 insured @entity90 other vehicles that scored poorly by the institute 's measurement included the @entity87 , @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity97 ’s @entity96 and @entity98 , @entity99 and the @entity100			1
‘ there are many factors that can influence claim rates and we will study the results to determine if the data can provide us with useful information for future safety developments , ’ said a @entity97 statement			0
the company had two cars on the list of the worst 10			0
‘ @entity97 has a longstanding commitment to safety and innovation and continues to explore enhancements to safety technology even beyond conventional safety technologies			0
we believe that the @entity98 and @entity96 provide excellent crash protection and safety to its occupants in the real world , ’ the automaker said			2
vehicles that scored well included the @entity125 and @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 570 , @entity130 convertible , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
the @entity94 sedan ranked fourth with a reported 25.4 injury claims per 1,000 insured @entity136 the @entity95 came in at no. 5 for personal injury claims with 24.9 injuries per 1,000 insured vehicles the institute also looked at which vehicles suffered the highest dollar amount of physical damage in a crash			1
not surprisingly , the $ 200,000 @entity145 fared the worst			0
although there were just 2.6 claims per every 100 of the @entity149 , each claim averaged $ 82,112			2
that was five times the second - worst vehicle , the @entity152 , which suffered an average $ 16,150 of damage in a collision			2
expensive cars topped the list , but the institute also looked at the results for vehicles that are priced under $ 30,000			0
the @entity160 ranked poorly both in claims frequency and the amount of damage inflicted per incident			1
the @entity160 averaged $ 6,221 per claim			2
other vehicles that had high claims and losses were the @entity170 coupe , the @entity172 four - wheel drive sedan and the @entity173			0
‘ for consumers concerned about insurance premiums , this information is key , ’ @entity48 said			0
‘ a lot of things go into your premium - your age , place of residence , driving record , sometimes even your credit history			0
the kind of vehicle you buy is the one factor that a consumer can control in the short term			0
