by @entity0 published : 19:29 est , 1 january 2013 updated : 07:50 est , 3 january 2013 @entity1 was one of the wealthiest women in @entity3 when she died age 104 three of the relatives fighting for a share of @entity9 's fortune now stand to inherit a further $ 6.3million each			1
the siblings ' windfall is as a result of the death of @entity14			1
the reclusive heiress 's great - half - nephew , @entity14 died before he could even be told that he stood to inherit $ 19million			1
@entity14 , 60 , died of hypothermia shortly before @entity18			2
he was homeless and his body was discovered under a railway bridge in @entity21			1
as he was not married and had no children the sum , which @entity23 were fighting to secure for him , will now be divided by his three surviving siblings - @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
speaking to @entity32 , attorney @entity30 who is representing 19 of the 21 potential distributees , described this latest development as ' a very sad part of a very sad story			2
' mr @entity30 , a partner at prestigious @entity38 firm @entity36 who specialises in trust and estate litigation , said that he was hopeful that the family 's case would reach a settlement			1
he revealed : ' there are efforts to settle it going on and that 's certainly a possibility			2
another possible outcome is a summary judgement whereby the issue is deemed so clear that there is no need for a trial			2
' the family remain prepared to go before a jury should no agreement be reached			1
mr @entity30 and his team have gathered and scrutinised thousands of documents and taken hours of depositions including ones from doctors and nurses entrusted with @entity65 's care in a discovery process which began in june			2
court papers were lodged last feburary in the bid to prove that the heiress , who was 104 when she died two years ago , was not in a fit state to sanction her second will , written in april 2005			2
while all who are fighting were named in her first @entity71 , the second makes no mention of the family members - some of whom had not seen their reclusive relative for 40 years			1
it divides her estate between her nurse , goddaughter , attorney , accountant , hospital , doctor , favourite museum , various employees and an art foundation that @entity65 , herself a talented artist , wanted established at her oceanfront estate , @entity93 , in @entity94			2
the family claim that @entity96 , ' was not competent to make a @entity71 in that she did not know the nature , extent or value of her assets			1
' conservative estimates place the fortune , inherited from her father @entity107 senator @entity106 's copper mines , at $ 307million			1
@entity14 froze to death in the bleak @entity21 winter before he could be told of his possible fortune they paint a picture of a vulnerable woman , who had retreated mentally and physically from the real world , and was coerced and defrauded by her closest advisors - attorney @entity114 , accountant @entity115 - and nurse , @entity117			1
mr @entity30 described a court - ordered accounting of @entity65 's finances as overseen by @entity114 and @entity115 in the last 15 years of her life as , ' a chilling report of mishandling , misappropriation and mismanagement			2
' wealth : @entity65 ( right ) is pictured as an 11 - year - old with her father and sister @entity129 in this 1917 photo great wealth in the @entity133 but @entity65 's copper mining fortune never brought her happiness @entity65 's is a strange and sorry tale			1
during her life she regarded her great wealth as ' a menace to happiness			0
' when she died two weeks shy of her 105th birthday the only people present at her burial were funeral home employees			0
' everything stopped for her when her mother died ' she had spent the the final two decades of her life in seclusion in @entity38 's @entity150			0
she was n't ill. ironically it was her fear of illness and dying that saw her effectively give up her life some 20 years before her death			1
while she lived a solitary life her three fabulous homes sat empty : the $ 100million @entity93 estate , a $ 24million country house in @entity160 and a $ 100million co-op , the largest apartment on @entity163 overlooking @entity164			1
at 42 rooms @entity65 's was the largest apartment on @entity163 and overlooked @entity164 @entity65 's @entity160 country house worth $ 24million @entity93 , @entity94 , a vast estate that has lain empty since 1963 according to @entity174 , @entity65 's great - half - nephew , a former @entity170 ambassador and one of the relatives embroiled in the legal battle , ' everything stopped for her when her mother died			1
' @entity96 's mother , @entity175 , was 39 years younger than @entity176 who was a widower when they met following the death of his first wife			1
most of the relatives fighting for the family fortune are descendants from that first marriage			0
from the very beginning @entity96 's life was touched by intrigue and tragedy			0
no record was ever found of the marriage between @entity170 - born @entity175 and @entity176 which supposedly took place in @entity170 five years before her birth			0
unfazed by public opinion @entity176 , who paid little attention to ethics and fulfilled his ambition to enter politics by buying votes , set @entity175 and his daughter up in a @entity163 apartment that cost three times more than the @entity201			0
he was as wealthy as @entity202 , a product of the @entity133 who made his fortune in copper mines , timber and banks and owned the land that would one day become @entity210			0
former @entity3 senator @entity106 , center , joins his daughter , @entity96 , at the @entity213 in @entity38			0
@entity96 's only sister , @entity129 died of meningitis age 16 and @entity65 grieved her loss to the end			0
she briefly married a bank clerk , @entity218 but the marriage foundered within months and ended in divorce after two years			0
and so @entity65 's retreat from adulthood began			0
speaking to @entity224 last year @entity223 said : ' she did n't want to go out			1
she did n't want to have beautiful things			2
she just wanted to be home and play with her dolls			0
' @entity96 collected dolls obsessively - on her mother 's death she filled her apartment with them			2
@entity96 occupied the entire eighth floor of the @entity163 building while her mother had an almost equally large apartment on the 12th			0
she always referred to it as ' mummy 's apartment			0
' the two women were constant companions following the end of @entity65 's brief marriage			0
in stark contrast to her father 's greed @entity65 was generous to the point of extravagance			0
during the @entity251 she and her mother tore down their @entity94 home and rebuilt it just to give people jobs			0
she sent dolls to friends as surprises , once buying two first class seats to @entity260 : one for a doll and one for her personal physician to make sure it arrived safely			0
she paid $ 342,000 a year in tax and upkeep on her @entity38 apartment , employed gardeners and groundkeepers and effectively funded a life she herself did not live .			1

death of homeless man who did n't even know he was an ' heir ' adds an extra $ 19million to three surviving siblings named in first @entity71
fight will go before a jury this year if no settlement is reached
