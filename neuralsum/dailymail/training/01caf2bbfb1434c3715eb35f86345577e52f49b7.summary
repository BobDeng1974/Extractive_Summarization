by @entity0 for @entity1 1st odi , @entity2 - match abandoned 2nd odi , @entity5 - @entity4 won by 133 runs @entity3 , @entity4 won by 6 wickets @entity9 , @entity10 - september 2 @entity11 , @entity12 - september 5 @entity13 look about as likely to win the @entity14 as @entity15 do the @entity16 after another abject performance at @entity4 which advertised their long - standing one - day weaknesses in all their infamy			1
an @entity13 team that were so dominant by the end of the test series have been made to look like limited - overs novices in two thrashings by a rejuvenated @entity4 who have simply come alive in coloured clothing			1
how can a change of format herald such a transformation of fortunes for an @entity13 side who once again looked out - dated , devoid of imagination and flair and unable to force the pace against even a moderately spinning ball ? it is a mystery which leaves @entity39 with much to ponder at the start of an intensive run of 50 - over matches which is supposed to provide the perfect preparation for a tilt at a @entity14 which @entity13 have never won			1
‘ it ’s the fact that there are some good players there who are not showing it			0
it ’s frustrating that we ’re not playing to the standards we ’re capable of			0
‘ everyone keeps talking about more power at the top but we ’re getting good starts			0
the problem is our top scores have been in the 40s and we need bigger runs than that at the top of the order			0
’ the one consolation from a six - wicket defeat that @entity4 completed with 42 balls to spare is that conditions at @entity4 , not to mention much of the support , were far more @entity84 than what awaits them in @entity87			2
@entity4 , who looked spent after being thrashed 3 - 1 in the @entity93 series , were made to feel right at home by at least 60 per cent of spectators supporting them , the loud booing of @entity90 whenever he went near the ball and a pitch which again raises questions			1
@entity100 groundsman @entity99 was under pressure after his lifeless surface for the first test last month but here he produced another slow turner which did little to provide either entertainment or ‘ home ’ conditions			0
yet the pitch is no excuse for an @entity13 side capable of losing one - day games anywhere , not least when the world champions are in such irresistible form six months before their title defence in @entity114 and @entity115			1
@entity13 ’s collapse from the bright start provided by @entity39 and @entity118 to a woefully under par 227 all out as soon as they faced spin could have happened at any time in the last 20 years , so perennial are their limited - overs limitations			1
all @entity121 , who has looked a different captain in the one - day arena , seemingly had to do was throw the ball to part - time spinners @entity126 and @entity52 and @entity13 ’s decline was on			1
once the occasional bowlers had claimed a wicket each , @entity121 threw the ball to @entity131 and @entity132 and that decline became terminal , @entity13 crashing from 82 without loss to 182 for seven			0
nothing sums up the feeble nature of @entity13 ’s batting than the fact that only one four was hit between the 18th and the 44th overs while the form of their key one - day batsman @entity141 is one of the biggest causes for concern			2
add @entity147 ’s wretched one - day form and it is clear the batting mountain @entity13 must climb now resembles @entity150			0
decisions : @entity121 won the toss and elected to bowl first for @entity4 intent : @entity13 captain cook put on 82 runs for the first wicket with @entity118 breakthrough : @entity118 was the first man to fall when he was caught by @entity121 off @entity126 for 42 looking back with anger : captain cook was stumped for 44 by @entity4 captain @entity121 as @entity13 lost their way @entity13 are expected to include @entity162 and @entity163 for their squad for the one - off @entity165 international against @entity4 at @entity10 next sunday			1
hard - hitting @entity167 batsman @entity162 and @entity168 left - arm seamer @entity163 look likely to be handed their debuts in an @entity13 side that will be captained by @entity141			2
at a time when 300 has become little more than par in one - day cricket @entity13 have reached those lofty heights no more than four times in their last 37 internationals , the most damning statistic of all			0
neither spin nor pace posed many problems for @entity4 , with @entity182 struggling to make an impact in his first appearance for @entity13 in just under a year			2
it was largely plain sailing for @entity4 but there was a reminder of the acrimony that goes back to the incident between @entity90 and @entity132 during the first test when @entity190 was given a send - off by @entity13 and responded by pointing his bat at @entity90 and @entity193			1
umpires @entity194 and @entity195 had words with both @entity193 and captain cook			0
whipped off : @entity147 feel for just two runs as he was stumped by @entity121 from @entity132 's bowling @entity200 : @entity141 was gone for 10 when he edged behind off @entity131 to leave @entity13 120 - 4 short : @entity201 ( left ) was run out with a direct hit from the deep by @entity203 ( right ) direct hit : @entity126 celebrates after @entity53 's throw from the deep crashed into the stumps and left @entity201 short otherwise there was little to be excited about , @entity52 completing his perfect day with an unbeaten 64 as @entity4 took a 2 - 0 lead with two to play in a series which has brought @entity13 back to earth with a thud			1
‘ we can turn this round quickly but it starts with individual responsibility , ’ added @entity39			0
‘ it will take someone to score a hundred and everyone will jump on the back of that , we will score 330 and things will change			0
’ that will take some doing as , to coin a phrase beloved of @entity222 , @entity13 would not appear to have a ‘ cat in hell ’s chance ’ of emerging with even a share of this series , let alone a stab at the biggest prize in one - day cricket next february			2
they need a huge improvement at @entity10 on tuesday			0
inspiration : @entity126 pulled off a stunning low catch at slip to dismiss @entity193 for just two runs delight : @entity126 celebrates his catch with @entity121 to leave @entity13 in trouble at 149 - 6 @entity240 : @entity241 's 42 down the order helped @entity13 limp past 200 at @entity4 the end : @entity182 was run out off the last ball as @entity13 scored just 227 first blow : @entity247 dismissed @entity248 early when the @entity249 cut straight to @entity141 at point in the wickets : @entity182 returned to the team and ended @entity254 's steady innings of 45 exchange : @entity190 looks back in anger after being dismissed by @entity193 for 40 home and dry : @entity52 's unbeaten 64 guided @entity4 to victory with seven overs to spare at @entity4 baffled : @entity247 , @entity90 and @entity39 look short of ideas as @entity13 are thrashed again			1

@entity4 take 2 - 0 lead in series after second straight thumping victory
*tourists* restricted @entity13 to 227 before chasing modest target with ease
@entity13 must win last two games in @entity271 and @entity272 to level series
no @entity13 batsman passes 50 with @entity39 's 44 the top score
@entity13 collapsed from 82 - 0 after strong start from @entity39 and @entity118
@entity52 's unbeaten 64 anchors @entity4 's chase in @entity282
