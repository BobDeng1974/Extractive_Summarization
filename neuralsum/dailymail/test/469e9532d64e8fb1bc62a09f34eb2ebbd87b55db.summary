as the fashion crowd took their seats and the lights went down for the we are handsome @entity6 show in @entity7 on tuesday night , things took an unusual turn			2
the catwalk was replaced with a tennis court , the front row with stadium seating , and the usual parade of slender models walking single file was nowhere in sight			2
instead , four strong , muscular women sashayed onto the grass , and proceeded to stretch and bend their bodies into yoga poses			0
@entity29 , along with former @entity23 pole vaulter @entity21 , @entity25 star @entity24 , and @entity26 and @entity28 star @entity27 , wowed the crowds as they struck strong poses			1
the models included ballerinas and sprinters , while @entity74 also made an appearance			0
they carried tennis rackets , volleyballs , and skipping ropes as they walked the border of the tennis court showcasing high - tech sports - luxe fabrications			0

the beautiful 37 - year - old said she was n't nervous despite being absent from the runway in nearly a decade , and the age difference between herself and the other participants			0
' i ’m quite comfortable with myself			0
i ’m older than most girls here but ' i 'm quite comfortable with my body and exercise a lot so it ’s a good fit , ' she said , adding that the we are handsome message aligned with her health and fitness philosophies			2
@entity109 star @entity74 was one of the few ' traditional ' models in the show athletic : the brand emphasised strong fitness - focused women above traditional runway models @entity29 told @entity88 that there is a start contrast in her fitness and diet habits when she is in @entity122 versus her life at home in @entity125			1
' i exercise in @entity125 for two hours a day , but then when i 'm in @entity122 i do n't exercise at all , ' she revealed , adding that in @entity122 she struggles to find the time in her schedule			1
' my diet in @entity125 is a lot healthier in @entity125 than it is in @entity122			1
it 's so much easier to eat really healthy food there , it 's all organic , locally grown food			0
' we do n't snack in @entity125 either - we do n't have chips and lollies and things , so i find it a lot easier to eat over there			1
' when i 'm in @entity122 i love to go out to restaurants , drink red wine , and i do that a lot during @entity109 as well as its so social			2
' @entity27 told @entity88 that she thought there had been a mistake when she was asked to model in a @entity109 show			1
yogis on the field : @entity151 co-owner @entity150 ( left ) and pole vaulter turned yogi @entity21 ( right ) had starring roles in the show lifestyle : speaking to @entity88 , @entity29 revealed that she works out for two hours a day at home in @entity125 , and finds it a lot easier to eat healthily there than in @entity122 , where her social life sees her out for dinner most nights the 20 - year - old has a huge following on @entity28 , where 680,000 followers are glued to her daily yoga poses			1
' at first i was confused and double checked it was for runway , ' she said			0
' i was told fitness influencers were involved , so that was exciting , then i realised it was different from ‘ normal modelling ’			1
' [ we are @entity65 ] have picked up on the fact social media has such a power for advertising			0
' we ’re all just regular girls , i think that we ’re helping to promote a healthy body image			0
fitness is n’t one shape or size , so we ’re empowering one another and celebrating every single , shape , size and sport			0
’ ' girls who are active are the new shape ' : we are @entity191 design duo @entity190 and @entity192 told @entity88 that they chose girls who embodied the healthy lifestyle for the show we are handsome design duo @entity190 and @entity192 are known for pushing boundaries but believe there will be only positive reaction to their unusual model choice			1
' there ’s a big thing about " who should be on the runway " so we know we ’re breaking rules by having girls that have never been on a catwalk before ( and who are nervous about it ) , ' @entity192 told @entity88			1
' but the rules are there to be broken , times have changed and girls who are active are the new shape			0
strong really is the new sexy			0
' ' a lot of the girls are very big on @entity28 and encourage people to follow in their active foot steps , so we have chosen experienced yogis , a ballerina , a sprinter and pole vaulter and people who embody healthy eating too , ' said @entity190 .			2

we are handsome designers @entity190 and @entity192 chose real - life fitness influencers above models
@entity29 , @entity21 , @entity24 , @entity150 and @entity27 were among the athletic stars
@entity29 told @entity88 that she exercises two hours a day in @entity125 *...* but barely makes it to the *gym* in @entity122
