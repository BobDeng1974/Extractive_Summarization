by @entity0 for @entity1 a revolutionary cream made from silicone claims to dramatically reduce unsightly scars and stretch marks in under a month			1
@entity6 , which works by covering the scar or stretch mark in a thin , invisible film of silicone , is said to reduce the appearance of skin problems by 50 per cent			1
the film protects the top layer of skin in its own healing ‘ micro-environment ’ , sealing in moisture and helping stimulate the production of collagen , which boosts the skin ’s recovery			1
@entity6 , which works by covering the scar or stretch mark in a thin , invisible film of silicone , is said to reduce the appearance of skin problems such as stretch marks and scars by 50 per cent stretch marks occur when the skin is stretched extensively over a short time period			1
the rapid stretching causes the middle layer of skin ( dermis ) to break in places , allowing the deeper skin layers to show through , forming stretch marks			1
the dermis is made - up of strong , inter-connected fibres that enable your skin to stretch as your body grows			1
if part of your body , such as your abdomen ( tummy ) , grows rapidly over a short period , the fibres can become thin and over-stretched and some may break			2
at the point where the skin fibres break , tiny tears develop which allow the blood vessels below to show through			2
this is why stretch marks are often red or purple when they first appear			2
when the blood vessels eventually contract ( shrink ) , the pale - coloured fat underneath your skin will be visible , and your stretch marks will change to a silvery - white colour			1
source : @entity63 the product also includes beta glucan , a naturally occurring plant or yeast extract which has a proven protective and hydrating effect on wounds , and powerful @entity71 uv filters to shield against sun damage			0
in clinical trials , users who applied it twice a day said they noticed a 50 per cent reduction in the appearance of their stretch marks on their thighs , stomach and hips in 28 days - and some much sooner			1
patients with both existing and new scars , caused by minor surgery , burns , acne or accidents , who used the treatment , also reported a reduction in the length and height of their scarring			0
they said the treatment helped to restore their skin to a more normal colour and texture , helping scars to fade and diminish			1
sensations of burning , tingling and itching were also reduced			0
the @entity102 scientists behind the product claim it is the ' first medically recognised and clinically proven treatment for stretch marks to either reduce existing scars or treat new ones , and help treat and prevent stretchmarks '			2
it is the first time that an easy - to - apply silicone treatment has been made available to the general public in @entity112			2
in clinical trials , users who applied the cream twice a day said they noticed a 50 per cent reduction in the appearance of their stretch marks on their thighs , stomach and hips in 28 days traditional , professional silicone gel or sheet treatments for scars can often cause embarrassment to patients because they are visible to others			1
they are also more expensive and can be difficult for the user to apply			0
nine in ten women are affected by stretch marks - narrow streaks or lines that develop on the surface of the skin			2
although pregnancy is one of the most common causes , they can also affect young women who have not had children			0
growth spurts and weight fluctuations can also cause them			0
while usually harmless but unsightly , if there are clinical complications with stretchmarks then inflammation or itching can occur , causing pain and infection			0
the treatment , which comes in a cream or deodorant - style stick , costs between £ 19.95 and £ 24.95 at @entity154			0
the cream is a similar formulation to the stick , but easier for people with stretch marks to apply on a larger surface area			0
a thin , transparent silicone film is released to hydrate , protect and restore the upper layer of the skin and stimulate collagen production , creating a protective barrier for scars to help heal			1
the cream also helps to keep the skin 's natural moisture balance under control , in turn helping it to soften and flatten scar tissue and restore the skin to a more normal colour and texture so that even old scars fade and diminish			1
it also helps to relieve burning , tingling and itching sensations			0
the product contains : a powerful @entity178 and uvb screenprotects scars from uv rays ( scars need to be protected from uv radiation for least six months )			0
beta glucan helps to hydrate the skin and is helps to form a film over the scar			1
@entity188 ( polyvinyl pyrrolidone ) also a film forming agent and frequently used in the treatment of wounds			0
it is said to allow a longer contact time between the active ingredients and the damaged skin tissue so that the skin can repair itself faster @entity198 ( beta glucan ) a well - known wound healer , calms , protects and hydrates the skin			0
the cream is a similar formulation to the stick , but easier for people with stretch marks to apply on a larger surface area .			0
