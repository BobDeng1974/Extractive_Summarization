by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 ’s summer of reckoning as @entity5 captain begins in earnest at @entity7 on thursday when he leads a side containing three debutants into what his opposite number says will be a hostile encounter against @entity13			1
all eyes will be on @entity2 as he attempts to show he has the captaincy skills to ease the winter misery by overcoming a team still indignant at what they see as @entity20 slurs on the legitimacy of spinner @entity23 ’s bowling action			1
the controversial run - out of @entity25 , when backing up , by @entity23 in the final one - day international was still on the agenda on wednesday			1
@entity28 , the @entity13 captain , sought to justify his side ’s ‘ @entity30 ’ of @entity25 by saying that @entity23 ’s action had only ever been reported in @entity5			1
new start : @entity2 ( right ) talks to his new opening partner , debutant @entity34 ( left ) the heat is on : @entity2 prepares in the nets at @entity40 's where a new era under his captaincy begins on thursday tough cricket : @entity13 captain @entity28 ( right ) has predicted a fiery series against @entity5 ‘ everything started with the reporting of @entity45 , ’ said @entity28			1
‘ when people find a bowler difficult to handle they tend to report him			0
we all know it ’s going to be a hostile series but we ’re up for the challenge			2
’ it means both sides still feel hard done by - @entity2 said the ‘ @entity55 ’ was ‘ still frustrating ’ - as they approach an @entity58 series in which @entity5 will need to regain the faith of a public who might accept an odi series loss to @entity13 but not one in test cricket			1
without question there will be extra pressure on @entity2 , even though that might seem harsh after all he has achieved as a batsman and as a captain in winning in @entity70 and at home against @entity72 last summer			2
yet there is no doubt that @entity2 retains the full support of the @entity5 management , the @entity77 and his players			1
all he has to do is repay that faith			0
‘ it feels like a fresh start , it feels good , ’ said @entity2 in the @entity40 ’s sunshine			1
‘ i ’ve got on really well with @entity84 since he came back and it has been good to have @entity86 with us			0
we ’ve had two great days here in the build - up to this series and hopefully people will be ready to go			0
’ moving up : @entity92 , who will bat at @entity94 in the first test , gets poised to take a catch during practice much has been made of the need for @entity5 to play positively and with aggression and , on a pitch which looks as green as the outfield , @entity2 ’s plan is to hit @entity13 hard with a four - man seam attack that seems sure to include the returning @entity104			1
comeback : @entity104 is poised to return as part of a four - pronged seam attack against @entity13 yet if @entity2 ’s critics are expecting a transformation in his captaincy style , they may be disappointed			1
he would be foolish to try to be a chameleon and attempt ‘ funky ’ field placings and bowling changes as @entity115 does			2
@entity2 ’s strengths are leading from the front and man - management			2
the best way for him to energise @entity5 is by scoring his first test century in more than a year and allowing the newcomers - his opening partner @entity34 , @entity122 and a virtual newcomer in @entity92 , who will bat at @entity94 in this first @entity95 ahead of @entity125 and @entity126 - time to bed in to their new environment			1
two players who will not be at @entity7 , @entity25 and @entity130 , have commanded almost as much attention as those who will take on @entity13 in this first of two tests , but @entity2 was adamant @entity5 have got their selection right			1
@entity130 was the one glimmer of hope to emerge from the @entity137 but @entity5 feel he has not played enough cricket after the self - inflicted blow of breaking a wrist when punching a locker out of frustration in the @entity143			2
‘ he was n’t quite ready , ’ said @entity2			2
‘ he ’s only bowled 30 - odd overs and has been a bit rusty , going for four - and - a - half or five an over			0
it ’s a big ask to come back quickly from an injury like that			0
’ steam in : @entity150 is another set to debut in @entity5 's attack after impressing in limited overs formats someone who plays despite not having much cricket is @entity156 , another under extra pressure after being left out following @entity5 ’s @entity137 - losing defeat in @entity159			1
he returns after just one first - class match as a wicketkeeper with @entity162 because of his chronic achilles problem			0
‘ he has been picked because of his long - term record as an @entity5 player , ’ said @entity2			1
‘ he has a wealth of experience in a side that is changing			0
he ’s a proven international whereas @entity130 is n’t quite there yet			0
@entity156 has a lot more to offer			0
i ’m backing his ability and we should support him			0
’ it was good to hear @entity2 backing prior			2
the captain had a big say in the appointment of @entity84 , the sacking of @entity180 and clearly now the personnel he wants alongside him at @entity7			0
that is how it should be			0
@entity5 's line - up : ( back row ) @entity92 , @entity122 , @entity104 , @entity186 , @entity150 and @entity34			1
( front row ) @entity188 , @entity156 , captain @entity2 , @entity189 , @entity125 and @entity126 start : 11am at @entity7			1
@entity190 : live on @entity191 from 10am ; @entity192 from 10.25			0
umpires : @entity194 ( @entity72 ) , @entity195 ( @entity196 )			0
tv : @entity198 ( @entity72 )			0
match referee : @entity200 ( @entity201 )			0
weather : bathed in sun on wednesday and expected to be kind for first three days			0
pitch watch : @entity2 says it ’s the greenest he has ever seen it			2
@entity5 want as much pace , movement and bounce as possible			0
if @entity5 fail this summer @entity2 will not have anything to complain about , yet with so many new faces and @entity104 playing his first test in seven years , it would be unrealistic to expect them to hit the ground sprinting			1
this is the first time they will have fielded three debutants since , well , their last test , and the identities of two of those who played in @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 , proves not all newcomers adapt quickly			0
@entity92 , who was the third debutant at the @entity224 , @entity34 , @entity225 and @entity150 all have the ability to enjoy long @entity5 careers but , for now , they will need as much help as possible from the senior spine - in particular the captain			1
@entity5 : @entity2 ( capt ) , @entity34 , @entity92 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity232 , @entity156 ( wkt ) , @entity189 , @entity233 , @entity104 , @entity188			1
@entity13 : @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity28 ( capt ) , @entity240 ( wkt ) , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 .			2

three debutants line up for @entity5 in the first test against @entity13
@entity34 , @entity122 and @entity249 will play at @entity7
@entity13 *remain* bitter about spinner @entity23 ’s bowling action being reported
@entity28 used the issue to in part justify the @entity255 ’ of @entity25
the visiting skipper expects a hostile encounter with @entity5
@entity2 says lining up with his new - look team ' feels like a fresh start '
