a leading @entity1 mp has claimed that 2,000 @entity2 have travelled to @entity3 and @entity4 to fight for @entity5 and other jihadist organisations			1
@entity7 , mp for the @entity9 constituency , claimed that official figures on the numbers of @entity2 jihadis is grossly underestimating the size of the problem			1
@entity2 security officials believe in the region of 500 men have travelled to @entity3 and @entity4 , but mr @entity7 claims this figure is widely inaccurate			1
i think 2,000 is a better estimate			0
my experience in @entity9 is it is a huge , huge problem			0
' mr @entity7 told the @entity33 : ' the government does not have significant people at border control			2
the fact is these jihadists are coming in and going out without almost ever being arrested			0
we have had hardly any arrests			0
we have had people coming back in after six months in @entity4 and they are not being picked up			2
' mr @entity7 's warning follows reports that @entity2 jihadis @entity44 , 20 and @entity45 , 21			1
the two men from @entity47 are believed to have been killed in heavy fighting in the @entity4 border town of @entity25 , which has been the subject of a major counter-offensive by @entity53 fighters , supported by @entity55 bombers			1
@entity56 grew up in north @entity47 in a @entity2 - @entity58 family and converted to @entity59 at the age of 16			0
the @entity55 has been using the fearsome b1 - b bomber to attack @entity5 targets in @entity25 , @entity4 he told the @entity63 back in august that he was one of the few @entity2 jihadists who fought with @entity5 in @entity4 and @entity3			1
during the interview , he admitted that he was never going to return to @entity2 despite the pleas of his family			0
@entity68 grew up in west @entity47 and is from a @entity2 - @entity70 background			0
he entered @entity4 in december 2013 after crossing the @entity72 border			0
almost 30 @entity2 are believed to have been killed fighting for jihadist organisations although the @entity75 confirmed that determining exact figures is incredibly difficult			1
a spokesman said : ' we are aware of reports of the death of two @entity2 nationals in @entity4			1
' the @entity2 has advised for some time against all travel to @entity4 , where all @entity2 consular services are suspended			2
' as we do not have any representation in @entity4 , it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting @entity2 nationals there are extremely limited			2

@entity7 claimed officials have underestimated @entity95 numbers
the @entity1 mp believes at least 2,000 @entity2 have gone to @entity3 and @entity4
he *blasted* the @entity100 for failing to *intercept* jihadists at the *airport*
