rugby union has a doping problem , with one former international coach claiming that there has been ‘ institutionalised drug - taking ’ since the game turned professional			1
in a week when @entity10 ’s @entity9 became the 10th rugby union player in the @entity12 this year to be suspended for doping offences , the most senior figure in @entity8 rugby has admitted that the sport has an issue with drugs that urgently needs to be tackled			1
less than a year before @entity8 stages the @entity17 , @entity18 , the @entity19 ’s chief executive , said : ‘ whichever way you look at it i think there is recognition that there is a problem			2
former @entity28 and @entity29 prop @entity27 lifted the lid on doping in rugby ‘ we are addressing this and not putting it under the carpet			2
we ’re recognising this is an issue			0
’ @entity18 and the @entity19 point to the fact that , although 15 of the 43 banned athletes or coaches listed by @entity43 are from rugby union , the vast majority of players come from the junior ranks			1
indeed @entity18 was responding to figures which appear to show that professional rugby ’s endless drive for players to become bigger , stronger and faster is placing sometimes intolerable pressures on young players to take performance - enhancing drugs			1
but @entity53 has spoken to a former international coach who believes it is naive to think the problem is limited to young players trying to take a short cut to the professional ranks			1
speaking to this newspaper under condition of anonymity , the former coach , who has worked extensively in @entity8 , says he walked away from the professional game in disgust at the scale of drug - taking			1
@entity19 chief @entity18 ( right ) recognises there 's a problem with performance - enhancing drugs @entity27 is the former @entity28 and @entity29 prop who dared compare drug use in @entity73 rugby to cycling , claiming it is as rife as it was in the @entity78 peloton at the height of the @entity81 scandal in 1998			1
for speaking out he risked losing everything			0
the @entity73 players ’ union issued a writ on behalf of their 134 members , with each player wanting € 2,000 in costs — a total of more than £ 200,000			1
a @entity73 court cleared him of defamation in september			0
@entity27 , who claimed he was given the banned substance cortisone during the 1995 @entity17 , questioned the physical size of the modern professional rugby player , his concern sparked by individuals who were somehow gaining 20kg of muscle in a single season			1
the 47 - year - old said such a gain could not be achieved naturally ‘ i ’m sure there was the odd player taking drugs before the sport went professional , ’ said the former coach			1
‘ but what i found abhorrent was the institutionalised drug - taking that came in in the professional era			1
‘ players are being told to bulk up , and it ’s being spelled out to them in no uncertain terms that the way to bulk up is to take drugs			2
‘ you ca n’t become as big as the players are becoming without a serious amount of drug - taking			1
once a core of players take drugs , get bigger and win places , the only way other players can compete is by taking drugs too			2
it ’s a problem that has engulfed the sport and i wanted no part of it			2
be assured , you do n’t get a physique like a modern - day rugby player by eating grilled fish and doing press - ups			1
’ the size and power of professional players has increased dramatically in the past two decades			2
an investigation by @entity53 earlier this year found that the average weight of an international player today is more than two stones greater than when the game turned professional in 1995			1
@entity8 's @entity143 was cleared of intentionally doping after testing positive for morphine last year ’s @entity145 who took on @entity147 weighed more than 2lb per man more than the @entity8 side who lost to @entity151 in the 1991 @entity17 final			1
meanwhile , a recent study of @entity155 schoolboy players returned 12 positive tests for anabolic steroids out of just 52 undertaken			1
our whistleblower ’s astonishing claims of ‘ institutionalised doping ’ in the professional game will set alarm bells ringing among rugby ’s administrators			1
they are desperate to avoid falling into the same trap which saw sponsors leave cycling in their droves in the wake of a succession of scandals , which culminated in @entity174 being stripped of his seven @entity78 titles			0
in september , former @entity28 and @entity29 prop @entity27 was found not guilty of defamation by the @entity177 in @entity178 for alleging that rugby is in precisely the same state of denial that gripped cycling before the infamous @entity81 affair in 1998 , starting a process which almost brought the sport to its knees			0
@entity27 , 47 , claims he was unwittingly , and illegally , administered cortisone by @entity73 team doctors during the 1995 @entity17 and believes that unreasonable demands placed on players by coaches desperate for short - term success have led to a culture of drug use			1
@entity193 ’s @entity9 became the 10th rugby union player in the @entity12 this year to be suspended ‘ when i meet rugby players and i see , for example , a change in their jaw , which is the mark of human growth hormone , i can only be concerned about the long - term evolution of my sport and the health of its players , ’ said @entity27			1
‘ @entity19 is in exactly the same situation as before the @entity81 cycling business			0
’ it is impossible to know just how deep rugby ’s doping problem runs			1
but there has been growing concern since the advent of professionalism that the increasing physical demands placed on players and the refusal by administrators to reduce the frequency of matches has inevitably led to some opting to cheat			0
@entity220 , the director of communications and education at @entity43 , who run the @entity19 ’s testing programme , said the evidence points to more of a problem in the junior ranks than at elite level but agrees that questions should be asked across the whole of rugby union			1
‘ i think it ’s a really important conversation to be having , ’ said @entity232			0
‘ there is an issue in rugby , and this is something the @entity19 have acknowledged			0
but what we do n’t know , and will probably never know , is how big an issue it is			0
@entity241 and @entity243 hooker @entity242 has been provisionally suspended ‘ what we are acknowledging , based on evidence , is a trend towards younger players testing positive			1
the evidence suggests younger players and players at lower levels are trying to get into the top level by using banned substances			0
‘ our understanding is that it is easy to buy steroids , but there are an awful lot of risks involved			0
the substances could be anything			0
they will have no idea of the dosages			0
but it is not illegal to buy steroids for personal use			0
it is only illegal to sell them or supply to others			0
’ @entity232 says the @entity19 are committed to cracking down on drug use			0
of the 536 tests carried out last year , about 75 per cent were out of competition and a certain number of players are on the @entity277 , which means they have to inform @entity43 of their whereabouts and can be tested ‘ anytime , anyplace , anywhere ’			1
the @entity19 also have a separate testing programme to tackle the use of illicit drugs and earlier this year they commissioned researchers from the @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 at @entity288 and @entity289 to look into the abuse of ‘ performance and image - enhancing substances in male adolescent rugby union players ’			1
the @entity19 now employ two full - time anti-doping officers and last month their fourth annual report into the subject concluded : ‘ the next phase of anti-doping activity in @entity8 should maintain the education and deterrents that are manifestly successful in keeping the game clean at the senior elite level			2
’ but , while it may be convenient for rugby to direct attention at the junior level where some teenagers — including @entity310 , the son of former @entity312 international @entity311 — are lured into abusing steroids in a bid to secure contracts , it is inconceivable that cheating does not occur in the professional game			1
@entity242 ( right ) escaped punishment despite testing positive for a banned substance in 2010 ‘ i ’d been getting under pressure			0
a lot of people say you ’ve got the skills and stuff — you just need to put on weight , get bigger , ’ said @entity310 , who is serving a two - year ban after testing positive for two anabolic steroids at a @entity312 under 20 training camp in 2013			1
‘ one day , i just thought i ’ll get what my friend ’s taking			2
i did n’t look into it ; i did n’t think about it at all , the effects , or if it could hurt me			0
but when you want something so bad , you ’ll do anything			0
’ @entity310 bought the drugs legally on the internet and the availability of unregulated supplements and steroids online as well as in high - street gyms is now seen as a serious threat to all professional sports			2
@entity241 and @entity243 hooker @entity242 , who escaped punishment after testing positive for banned substance methylhexanamine following the @entity241 ’ clash with @entity351 in 2010 , is provisionally suspended following reports in the @entity73 media that he tested positive again in june , for anabolic steroid drostanalone			2
two years ago @entity356 ’s former @entity8 flanker @entity143 was cleared of intentionally doping after testing positive for morphine			2
but no positive results were returned in @entity8 last season			2
@entity18 added : ‘ the current @entity8 squad are very serious and very committed , and they take advice on a lot of those things			0
‘ but you ca n’t be complacent about all this			0
we are very transparent about it			0
we recognise that there are things that are putting pressures on particular ages , whether that ’s supplements or other things			0
but we are absolutely open , transparent and rigorous about education			0
’ @entity376 , the @entity19 ’s anti-doping and illicit drugs programme manager , said : ‘ the @entity19 takes anti-doping extremely seriously and condemns all drug use in sport			2
all players , at every level , should be aware that they can be tested any time , anywhere			0
