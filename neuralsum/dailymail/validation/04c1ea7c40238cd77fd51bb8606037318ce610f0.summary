she has walked for the likes of @entity2 and @entity3 , been a @entity4 for five years in a row , and on top of this , is a married woman			2
so it 's no wonder that busy supermodel @entity11 needs ways to unwind , just like everyone else			2
the 30 - year - old has now revealed her top tips for managing stress to online beauty magazine , @entity18 , and thankfully they are things that everyone can incorporate into their lifestyle			1
@entity11 commented on the feeling of love that she receives from spending time with her pet : ' she 's just full of love , as are most pets			2
' she goes on to suggest alternatives for those who do n't own dogs : ' if you do n’t or ca n’t have a pet , many animal shelters love to have volunteers who come to interact with the animals			0
' in fact , several shelters [ ... ] let you come and walk the dogs for a few hours a day			0
' @entity11 also recommends massaging oil into the skin on daily basis , revealing it 's the smell that works to de-stress : ' the scents will immediately transport you to a calm place			0
' aromatherapy oils are yet another way that the model stays stress - free in her hectic lifestyle forget coffee , the model drinks calming organic tea , containing liquorice ginger , cardamon , and cinnamon she even carries her oils with her , admitting , ' i never leave home without it			1
' the @entity4 model also says drinking a special herbal tea when she 's on the move or feeling out of sorts can make her feel calm again			2
in particular , she goes for natural herbal @entity84 tea , which consists of liquorice root , organic ginger , cardamom and cinnamon			0
@entity11 further adds that she personally opts for the tea when ' travelling [ or ] feeling restless			0
' the 30 - year - old emphasises always ' falling asleep the right way ' - especially with @entity26 next to her 5			1
spa day - a midday spa appointment is one of the @entity95 's favourite ways to unwind and for the model , getting her beauty sleep is a must			1
she opts for a pre-bed ritual to guarantee she 'll feel well - rested the next days , explaining that it 's important to fall ' asleep the right way '			2
this involves removing devices from around the bed			0
she said : ' reading on my @entity106 is a big no - no. ' instead , she suggested ' a cup of warm almond milk before bed and then massaging your feet with an essential oil			2
' the best time to go to sleep ? ' preferably at 10pm - according to @entity114 , an alternative medicine , originating from @entity116 , your body repairs itself most effectively between 10pm and 2am , ' she said			1
while another @entity120 tip for managing stress is : ' a mid-day @entity114 facial in between running to my appointments ' , which she describes as ' the perfect pick - me - up			1
' and the best bit is the massage			0
the model 's favourite parts to concentrate on are : ' my favorite part is the face , neck , arm , and shoulder massage			2
' for those who are new to the entire spa experience ? ' bring a friend to enjoy the day , ' she advises			0
for the next tip , @entity11 ca n't quite put her finger on the reason she finds painting her nails so relaxing			0
' maybe it 's the total distraction from all my daily activities and the focus it takes to paint inside the lines			0
' @entity11 finds that the concentration needed to paint her nails is a relaxing experience ayurvedic self - massage - the model has always been interested in alternative medicine and tried out @entity114 , which aims to balance the body , mind , and spirit through a combination of sleep , yoga , herbs and oils , meditation , and a healthy diet another tip from @entity11 : ' i love the idea of giving yourself an oil massage every day			1
' earlier this year the model became interested in @entity114 : an alternative medicine that originated in @entity116			1
' i wanted to try something new and good for my body and mind			0
' prior to giving the self - massage , the model suggests : ' [ rubbing ] a couple drops of calming oil into [ your ] hands for a few seconds ... and deep breaths to slowly transition into a meditative state			1
' @entity11 states that she enjoys an oil massage due to the fact : ' it 's incredibly soothing and detoxifying			0
' @entity11 says that something that everyone can relate to enjoying is a getaway the beauty pairs a face mask with under - eye patches , and for the extra relaxation factor , a cup of tea @entity11 flags going on holiday as ' the ultimate way to recharge ' and that listening to the sound of the waves is an incredible relaxation technique			1
her low - budget alternative ? ' if you ca n’t afford a seaside getaway , no problem			1
thankfully there 's an app for that - the soothing sound of crashing waves , no beach required ! ' and if you 'd rather just put your feet up at home , make like the model and slap on a face mask while you 're sipping a calming cuppa			1
although she admits : ' i try not to scare my husband like this too often ! '			0
