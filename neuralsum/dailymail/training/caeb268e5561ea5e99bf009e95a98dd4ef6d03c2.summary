@entity1 teams have bowed to public pressure , and sporting fairness , by agreeing to abandon double points for next year ’s final race			1
the rule was one of the sport ’s most derided ever initiatives when it was introduced for the 2014 season , which ended last sunday with @entity11 beating @entity12 fair and square			1
had the awarding of double points in @entity16 swayed the championship , it would have been one of the biggest travesties in any sport			1
public scepticism would have blown up to global outrage			0
@entity11 gives double peace signs after securing @entity1 championship fair and sqaure in @entity16 the teams assemble before the season - ending @entity25 where double points could have swayed the title as @entity11 said before the race : ‘ it is a question of what is fair			1
to lose by double points would suck			1
’ the teams had long known this and on wednesday the @entity33 and the @entity35 meeting in @entity36 decided to ditch the gimmick for 2015			1
the change needs to be ratified by the @entity40 ’s @entity39 , but there is almost no chance that they will go against the teams on such a clear - cut matter			0
the final approval should come in the @entity39 meeting in @entity47 on december 3			2
the rule , which was only in place for one year , was a bastardised version of @entity52 ’s proposal that three races should carry double points			2
the teams did not like this suggestion and the fudge of final scoring at only the last race was introduced			2
@entity63 waves the @entity64 after his victory in @entity16 put his second title triumph beyond doubt @entity11 ( left ) had to finish at least second in @entity16 to ensure @entity12 ( centre ) did n't beat him @entity1 chief executive @entity52 ( right ) had suggested three races be worth double points @entity69 secures title in @entity16 @entity52 said of his plan : ‘ one race is stupid but imagine if it was the last three races			1
it means that somebody would have to have a 150 - point advantage minimum to be sure they would win			0
the teams have not accepted it because they are bloody idiots			0
’ it is unlikely his three - race idea will be adopted , but that every race will count the same			0
double scoring was introduced to keep the last race alive after four championships had all been won by @entity88 of @entity89			2
last year he scorched to the title and the season faded away			0
but that did not convince the public of the merits of double scoring			0
one fans ’ survey said opposition to the rule ran at 96 per cent .			0

@entity33 and the @entity35 decided at meeting in @entity36 to *axe* double points for the final race of the @entity1 season
@entity106 at @entity107 to offer 25 points to the winner again
@entity11 *clinched* @entity1 championship with win worth 50 points
@entity12 could have *mathematically* *snatched* the title from @entity63
