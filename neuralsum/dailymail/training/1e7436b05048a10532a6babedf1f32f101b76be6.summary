@entity1 's middle class is less wealthy in 2014 than at any other time since the 1940s			0
the bottom 90 percent of families in the @entity1 collectively owns just 23 percent of total @entity1 wealth			1
meanwhile , those at the top end of society are getting richer with senior company executives and successful entrepreneurs earning pay packets that far exceed those of their predecessors			0
it means that ordinary middle class @entity1 families living the ' @entity17 ' are now worse off than during wartime			2
the startling statistics have been revealed in a new working paper put together by economists @entity22 of the @entity23 , @entity24 , and @entity25 of the @entity26			0
debt has been the big force driving net wealth lower for the middle class , according to @entity22 and @entity25			0
brief bubbles in stock and home prices in the 1990s and 2000s only temporarily offset the steady , depressing rise in mortgage , student - loan , credit - card and other debts for the bottom 90 percent wealth inequality , it turns out , has followed a spectacular @entity42 evolution over the past 100 years			1
from the @entity44 in the 1930s through the late 1970s there was a substantial democratization of wealth the pair claim that the economic imbalance that exists between the top members of society and those at the the bottom , is not simply a matter of rising pay packets but also as a result of great wealth inequality			1
from the @entity44 in the 1930s through the late 1970s there was a substantial democratization of wealth but the last four decades has been wealth inequality creep into society			0
put simply , only a tiny fraction of the population saw its wealth grow - namely those at the top 0.1 percent			1
the top 1 per cent of families earned 20 per cent of the country 's income - up from 10 per cent in the 1970s			2
at the very pinnacle , the extremely wealthy ( the top 0.1 percent ) includes 160,000 families with total net assets of more than $ 20 million in 2012			1
the fortunes of those families who are seen as ' rich ' and within the top 10 per cent of society did not rise as much as those at the very top ( the 0.1 per cent )			2
in other words , those who already had money saw their wealth continue to grow as they continued to earn off the returns of their wealth , whilst those families who did not make it into the top spots saw their fortunes grow at far slower pace			2
this rising inequality of wealth can only lead to more inequality of income and wealth in the future , @entity22 and @entity25 warn			1
the very rich will just keep getting richer by living on the returns from their wealth , while the rest of us will keep falling behind while the share of wealth of the bottom 90 percent of families did gradually increase from 15 percent in the 1920s to a peak of 36 percent in the mid- 1980 , it then dramatically declined			1
by 2012 , the bottom 90 percent collectively owns only 23 percent of total @entity1 wealth , about as much as in 1940 when it comes to the middle class , that particular section of society appears to have fared far worse			1
@entity22 & @entity25 note that although there is a widespread belief that wealth among the middle class has been rising and that better more productive lives are lead as a result , with greater home ownership and the rise of pensions , there has in fact been an erosion of wealth among the middle class and the poor			2
whilst the wealth of the bottom 90 percent of families did gradually increase from 15 percent in the 1920s to a peak of 36 percent in the mid- 1980s , it then dramatically declined			1
by 2012 , the bottom 90 percent collectively owned just only 23 percent of total @entity1 wealth , about as much as in 1940			1
the reason for the awkward position of @entity1 's middle class is because they have taken on more debt than ever before			0
although many middle class families own homes and have pensions , these same families also have much higher mortgages to repay with larger loans to repay			0
and while the value of assets also tends to rise as it did during the stock - market bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s , values then plummeted during the @entity147 of 2007 - 2009			0
the average wealth of bottom 90 percent of families jumped during the stock - market bubble of the late 1990s and the housing bubble of the early 2000s			1
but it then collapsed during and after the @entity147 of 2007 - 2009 incomes have stagnated for most @entity1 over the past few decades , once adjusted for inflation			2
along with rising debt levels , stagnant wages have made it impossible for most families to save very much money since the housing and financial crises of the late 2000s there has been no recovery in the wealth of the middle class and the poor			1
the average wealth of the bottom 90 percent of families is equal to $ 80,000 in 2012 â€” the same level as in 1986			1
at the top of the tree , the average wealth for the top 1 percent more than tripled between 1980 and 2012			0
for the wealthiest members of society , the @entity147 was a mere bump in the road on an upwardly inclining path towards even greater wealth			0
@entity22 & @entity25 explain the growing disparity in @entity1 wealth is due to a number of reasons			0
apart from a lack of real wage gains , it appears that people 's inability to save is helping to create a widening gulf between @entity1 's richest and poorest			0
at the top , wages sky rocketed , but at the bottom 90 per cent , with salaries barely moving , most families are unable to put any money away and save for the future			1
the worrying trend looks set to continue so long as wages at the top keep on rising and the middle class continue to fail to save			2
the economists suggest a number of policies that could be introduce to redistribute or at least reduce the concentration of wealth and encourage savings			0
they believe new regulations could be introduced to dissuade ' predatory lending ' where borrowers take on far more debt than they can realistically repay			0
they also suggest that people need to be encouraged in to saving more and that salaries at the lower end of society need also increase so that families can afford to save .			0

the rise in mortgages , student - loan , credit - card and other debts for the bottom 90 percent of society means poor are getting poorer
stagnant wages have made it impossible for most families to save very much money
however , the top 0.1 percent of @entity1 ' incomes have kept rising
this rising inequality of wealth will lead to more inequality of income and wealth in the future
