by @entity0 the @entity1 is preparing for a historic visit to the @entity3 to meet @entity4 , the @entity5 can reveal			1
her meeting with the new pope during her first overseas trip for three years will delight @entity10 ’s four million @entity9			1
it will also strengthen ties between the @entity14 and @entity15 churches , both of which appointed new leaders last year			1
strengthening ties : @entity1 ( left ) is preparing for a historic visit to the @entity3 to meet @entity4 ( right ) the new archbishop of @entity20 , @entity19 , has already met @entity4 at the @entity3			1
in an extraordinary break with tradition , say @entity3 sources , the @entity7 will not receive the @entity1 at the papal state apartments inside the @entity25			1
rather , the @entity27 - born @entity26 , who has a habit of dispensing with protocol , wants to keep the visit intimate and informal			1
he is expected to welcome her to the simple @entity3 boarding house which he has made his home and offer her a cup of tea in a small sitting room			1
the @entity7 has three rooms inside the @entity40 , or @entity40 , a five - storey hostel run by nuns where he is often seen in the canteen when not cooking his own pasta			0
the royal visit is expected in april , shortly before the @entity1 ’s 88th birthday , and she will be accompanied by @entity49 , 92			1
contrary to reports that @entity52 plans to curtail their foreign travel , they will go overseas to meet three world leaders in as many months			0
yesterday the @entity55 announced the @entity1 will make a three - day state visit to @entity57 in june for the @entity59 70th anniversary			1
meeting : in 1982 , the @entity1 became the first sovereign to welcome a @entity7 when @entity61 came to @entity62 with prince @entity49 , she will undertake engagements in @entity64 to mark the @entity10 war effort of june 6 , 1944			0
then , the couple wlll go to @entity67 to be formally received by president @entity68 and attend a series of state events			0
in @entity71 , the @entity1 will also meet @entity73 president @entity72 , a great admirer			2
the meeting with the @entity7 will be in striking contrast to the pageantry of 1980 when she became the first @entity10 monarch to make a state visit to the @entity3			2
there was also strict formality in 2000 when the @entity1 went to the @entity3 on a state visit to @entity73			1
this time , the atmosphere will certainly be very different from the security clampdown and media circus expected a few weeks earlier when @entity4 entertains @entity87 president @entity86			0
the @entity1 ’s visit will underline her position as the most @entity15 - friendly @entity90 of modern times			1
in 1982 , she became the first sovereign to welcome a @entity7 when @entity61 came to @entity62			0
she also gave pope @entity93 a full state welcome when he arrived in @entity95 in 2010			0
only nine months ago , she signed legislation repealing the 300 - year rule excluding royals who married @entity9 from the succession			0
four years ago : the @entity1 gave pope @entity93 a full state welcome when he arrived in @entity95 in 2010 three weeks ago , @entity4 included @entity10 ’s most senior @entity15 , the archbishop of @entity102 , @entity103 , in his first batch of new cardinals			1
the visit puts paid to suggestions the @entity1 is about to hand over most duties to other royals			2
this will be a long ‘ awayday ’ to @entity71 , with no overnight stay , but involves two high - level visits and makes it clear that the @entity1 and her husband intend to remain active in international public life			2
it was president @entity72 , rather than @entity4 , who originally suggested the @entity3 visit			2
though a member of the @entity73 communist party for 46 years , he is a great admirer of the @entity1 and , being nine months her senior , just pips her to the title of @entity126 ’s oldest head of state			2
the two leaders are said to get on extremely well and @entity128 and mrs @entity129 have visited the @entity1 and prince @entity49 at @entity52 several times			0
@entity25 officials declined to comment on whether they expect mr @entity68 , 59 , to have a new first lady at his side			0
last month , the @entity57 leader split from girlfriend @entity134 , 48 , after his affair with actress @entity136 , 41 , was revealed			0
he has refused to answer questions on the delicate subject .			0

@entity1 will meet new pope during her first overseas trip for three years
visit will strengthen ties between the @entity14 and @entity15 churches
@entity27 - born @entity26 wants it to be intimate and informal , sources say
expected to offer @entity1 a cup of tea in simple @entity3 boarding house
