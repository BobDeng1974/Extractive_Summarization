by @entity0 published : 08:44 est , 20 may 2013 updated : 13:12 est , 21 may 2013 a study has discovered that early humans began hurling stone - tipped spears and darts at large prey at least 90,000 years ago			1
there has been debate surrounding the precise date that early man began to use stone - tipped spears - with some experts suggesting their use as far back as 500,000 years ago - but until now , evidence to prove theories had been lacking			1
the throwing of spears was an important development because by throwing instead of thrusting , humans could hunt buffalo and other game from a safer distance , and with less risk of mauling			2
by using a calibrated cross-bow , archaeologists replicated the indentations made in animal bone by stone - tipped spears			1
they discovered that the same indentations were found in bones at least 90,000 years old archaeologist @entity31 , of @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 , shaped flint reproductions of spear and arrow points from the @entity38 in @entity39 and attached them to wooden shafts , according to a report in @entity42			2
together with a group of @entity45 students , @entity31 ran 15 experiments , throwing replica spears with bows or a calibrated crossbow at lamb and cow carcasses			0
after boiling the carcasses or burying them for rapid defleshing by microbes and insects , he found 758 wounds on the bones , which he examined microscopically , and compared to 201 cut marks in an experimentally created reference collection of butchered animal bones			0
the results showed ' quite a difference between the butchering marks and projectile impact marks , ' and revealed six types of distinctive projectile impact wounds , from drag marks to fracture marks and punctures			0
using the new technique , archaeologists discovered that the marks made by projectile or thrown spears ( left ) were quite different from marks made by spears used to simple stab or cut into the bone ( right ) @entity31 also noted that most projectile impact marks were located on vertebrae or rib bones and that 17 per cent of the marks overall - and 50 per cent of the punctures - held microscopic fragments of stone from the flint points , due to the high speed of impact			1
by contrast , none of the butchering marks contained such stone fragments , another key distinction			0
these findings prompted @entity31 and the @entity45 's @entity94 to take a new look at three bone specimens from large unidentified mammals - a rib and two vertebrae - from @entity99 in @entity39			0
using @entity31 's diagnostic criteria , the pair identified projectile impact marks on all three bones			0
experts have debated the precise date at which early man started to use stone - tipped spears for many years , but until now evidence to back up the various theories were lacking two dated to between 91,000 and 98,000 years ago and the third dated even earlier , between 153,000 and 174,000 years ago - making them the oldest direct evidence of the use of projectile weapons			1
archaeologist @entity114 at the @entity45 also finds the identification of projectile impact marksâ € ” at least on the two later bonesâ € ” highly persuasive : ' this strongly suggests that projectile technology at @entity99 was in use by at least 90 to 95,000 years ago , ' she says			1
but she 's less convinced by the evidence on the oldest bone , noting that only a ' single grain ' of stone from the projectile point was embedded in the bone			2
@entity31 's thesis will be published by the @entity127 in june .			0

experts have argued over the date at which early man first used stone - tipped spears , but there was very little evidence to back up various theories
but a technique developed by an @entity34 archeologist using replicas has shown humans used spears between 91,000 and 174,000 years ago
