@entity0 has been hit by a 6 per cent fall in profits after fed up customers switched to cheaper rivals			1
parent company @entity0 revealed its arm supplying homes with gas and electricity made £ 571million in 2013 , down from £ 606million a year earlier			1
chief executive @entity8 hit out at political attacks on the industry but critics said the firm was continuing to make huge profits ‘ on the back of spiralling bills for hard - pressed consumers ’			1
@entity0 saw profits fall by 6 per cent , after 2 per cent of customers switched to rival firms @entity0 lost two per cent of its residential customers 2013 , down to 15.3 million as households switched to other suppliers			1
it came after its move to increase bills by 9.2per cent on average from november as part of the winter round of price hikes			1
another 100,000 people have quit the group so far this year			0
but the company claimed customer switching was now ‘ stabilising ’ after it scaled back its price rise by 3.2per cent following a shake - up of the government 's so - called green levies on bills			1
across the @entity38 as a whole , operating profits were 2 per cent lower at £ 2.7 billion last year			2
mr @entity8 admitted that public and investor trust in the energy industry had been ‘ damaged ’ by the threat of price controls and political intervention			1
he said : ‘ @entity0 has reduced prices , designed new , competitive propositions and has a renewed focus on service			2
‘ our customers trust us to keep their lights on and their homes warm , as well as making the big , long - term investments which will secure their supplies for the future			2
' as we continue to debate the right future shape and structure of our industry , we will never lose sight of that			0
’ however he attacked @entity64 's pledge to freeze bills for two years if @entity66 wins power in 2015 , saying it was ‘ not a credible solution ’			1
he said : ‘ we firmly believe that any form of price control in a competitive market is not the answer and is not in the best interests of customers , and this has been clearly demonstrated by experience in other markets			2
‘ such proposals create both short - term uncertainty for all energy suppliers and longer - term additional costs for customers , ’ he added			2
@entity0 chief executive @entity8 blamed politicians for creating uncertainty in the energy market shares in @entity0 have plunged by more than a fifth since autumn following @entity66 's price freeze pledge			1
the stock has been driven down further after energy secretary @entity91 recently called for a full - scale investigation into the energy market that could see @entity0 broken up			1
in a letter , mr @entity91 urged competition authorities to ‘ think radically ’ as they consider whether to launch a probe			0
which ? executive director @entity96 said : ‘ @entity0 are still posting decent profits , despite angry customers leaving following recent price hikes and the company receiving over a million complaints last year			1
‘ when healthy profits are n't based on satisfied customers it 's further evidence the energy market is broken			2
’ @entity0 's results showed that higher wholesale prices and unseasonally warm weather at the end of last year saw @entity0 suffer an 18 per cent slump in operating profit in the final six months of 2013 , which offset a better start to the year			1
@entity115 , @entity66 ’s shadow energy secretary , said : ‘ however you look at it , there ’s no hiding the fact that on @entity122 ’s watch the energy companies have made their profits on the back of spiralling bills for hard - pressed consumers			1
‘ that ’s why the next @entity128 will undertake the biggest overhaul of our energy market since privatisation			0
‘ our plans will break up the big energy companies , put an end to their secret deals and make tariffs simpler and fairer			0
