@entity85 , @entity86 , added : ' bringing back sexy - a slither of flesh at the waist or a jigsaw of fabrics forming five shades of black - was only a sidebar to the main story : @entity4 has made it as a designer			1
' i ca n’t think of another celebrity who has been willing and able to create a unique style			0

' familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked			0
volumes have been subverted , menswear elements re-engineered to fit the female form and twists , spirals , seams and asymmetry interplayed			0
fabrics bounce and move , a swing is sculptural , and a more body conscious silhouette emerges ... ' for me it is a collection full of possibilities			0
' commenting on her range , @entity139 's @entity138 wrote : ' equally successful were the mannish double - breasted navy cocoon coats with neat horn buttons ; the herringbone coat with a bustle at the hip ; the chunky cream and navy sweaters with ballooning sleeves ; and the skirt made out of cream velvet bows - @entity152 's answer to the " modern day red carpet " conundrum when worn with a simple chenille sweater			2
' familiar shapes have been deconstructed and reworked ' , explained @entity4			2
' fabrics bounce and move , a swing is sculptural , and a more body conscious silhouette emerges ' @entity4 seemed to have the frosty weather in mind with this collection , with patent boots and luxurious coats @entity4 's collection went down a storm on social media with fashion editors such as @entity170 , right , hailing it as ' sexy ' ' sure , it 's not a problem that vexes most of us , but she 's got all her bases covered			1
