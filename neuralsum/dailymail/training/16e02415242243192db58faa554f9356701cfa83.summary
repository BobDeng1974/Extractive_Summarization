by @entity0 @entity2 has no plans to invade @entity4 but the @entity5 will respect the result of the upcoming referendum in @entity4 's @entity8 , @entity2 foreign minister @entity1 has said			1
speaking after several hours of talks in @entity11 with @entity13 secretary of state @entity12 , @entity1 there was still no common vision with the @entity15 over @entity4 and that @entity2 needed no international structure to help it mediate with @entity17			1
@entity12 also revealed that @entity2 president @entity18 will make no decision about the future of @entity4 until after the referendum on @entity8 's future			1
' neither we nor the international community will recognise the results of this referendum and we also remain deeply concerned about the large deployments of @entity2 forces in @entity8 and along the eastern border , ' he added			2
' right now , given this particular climate , we really need to hear more declarative policy in order to make clear where @entity2 is proceeding with respect to these troops and these exercises			0
' @entity12 said the @entity5 's next steps would depend on a final decision that @entity2 president @entity18 would take after the referendum			1
' the foreign minister made it clear that president @entity18 is not prepared to make any decision regarding @entity4 until after the referendum on sunday , ' @entity12 said			1
' we believe the referendum is contrary to the constitution of @entity4 , contrary to international law , is in violation of that law , and is illegitimate , ' he said			0
the news comes as @entity67 troops prepared for a possible attack by @entity2 forces by carrying out drills and firing rocket launchers near the capital			2
the moves were in response to fears that the @entity5 could move its military deeper into @entity4 after a @entity78 protester was killed overnight in @entity79			0
officials said that @entity2 would uphold its right to defend all its citizens in the country			0
@entity12 , pictured with @entity1 on the lawn of the @entity13 ambassador 's residence , @entity11 , has said @entity13 will reject the result of any referendum @entity1 said the talks were ' useful ' but refused to say how @entity2 will act until after the @entity8 referendum so far @entity2 troops have only occupied key parts of the @entity8 region , where they have a naval base , but @entity79 is 400 miles to the east			1
speaking to reporters after a talks with @entity13 secretary of state in @entity11 today , mr @entity1 said : ' we will respect the expression of the will of the @entity8 people in in the upcoming referendum			1
' the @entity2 does not and can not have any plans to invade the southeastern regions of @entity4			2
' sunday 's vote on @entity4 's strategic @entity108 peninsula of 2 million people - is widely expected to back secession and , potentially , annexation with @entity2			1
the new government in @entity17 believes the vote is illegal , but @entity114 says it does not recognize the new government as legitimate			0
the @entity13 and @entity116 say the @entity8 vote violates @entity4 's constitution and international law			1
if @entity8 votes to secede , the @entity13 and @entity116 plan to slap sanctions as early as monday on @entity2 officials and businesses accused of escalating the crisis and undermining @entity4 's new government			1
@entity1 on friday reaffirmed that @entity2 will ' respect the results of the referendum ' in @entity8 and said sanctions would harm relations			2
' our partners also realize that sanctions are counterproductive , ' he said			0
@entity134 and @entity13 leaders have repeatedly urged @entity114 to pull back its troops in @entity8 and stop encouraging local militias there who are hyping the vote as a choice between re-establishing generations of ties with @entity2 or returning to echoes of fascism from @entity4 's @entity145 era , when some residents cooperated with @entity148 occupiers			1
earlier today it was revealed that the @entity116 has drawn up a list of 120 @entity2 military figures it will hit with asset freezes and visa restrictions if @entity13 - led sanctions go ahead			2

the list represents the first concrete action against @entity2 by @entity134 , who until now have been more hesitant to issue sanctions compared with @entity13 , in part because of @entity2 investment in @entity134			0
speaking before the talks , @entity12 said he hoped the discussions would come up with a solution to ' resolve some of the differences between us ' as he welcomed @entity1 to the @entity13 ambassador 's residence in @entity187			1
however , @entity1 appeared to dash those hopes by saying there was ' no common vision ' between the two countries , although he added the discussion had been ' useful '			2
so far @entity2 forces have only occupied positions in @entity8 , where the country has a naval base the city of @entity79 , where the activist was stabbed to death , is 400 miles to the east of @entity8 as the country slips towards conflict , @entity1 insisted that talks with @entity12 had been ' useful ' politicians and officials in @entity114 could be hit with asset freezes and travel bans if a referendum goes ahead in @entity8 on sunday over whether to break away from @entity4 in favour of joining the @entity2			1
mr @entity12 said : ' obviously we have a lot to talk about and look forward to an opportunity to dig in to the issues and possibilities that we may be able to find about how to move forward together to resolve some of the differences between us			0
' we look forward , i know , to a good conversation			0
