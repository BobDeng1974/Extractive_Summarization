@entity0 believes @entity3 raider @entity1 is the horse which stands between him and a remarkable ninth @entity5 @entity6 at @entity7 on @entity8			1
the champion trainer will saddle three of the 10 entries in the £ 200,000 steeplechase with sponsors @entity13 making his 2013 winner @entity15 5 - 2 favourite to land a second victory in a race with a history of multiple winners			1
last week , @entity1 ’s trainer @entity20 said he was heading to @entity7 with concerns that the @entity23 - ridden horse lacked the necessary experience to land a first victory over three miles since his nursery days in the point - to - point field			1
@entity28 rides @entity15 following his @entity29 win at @entity30 last year trainer @entity0 fears that @entity1 is the only thing that stands between him and another win but , after watching the grey ’s victory in the two - and - a - half - mile @entity36 last month , @entity0 , who also saddles 6 - 1 shot @entity38 and 50 - 1 outsider @entity39 , senses where the danger lies			1
he said : ‘ @entity15 is last year ’s winner so deserves to be favourite but when i saw @entity1 win i thought that is the one to beat in the @entity44			1
i have always had the feeling @entity46 thought that as well			0
’ @entity0 also believes @entity47 - ridden @entity38 , beaten just under 15 lengths when third last year and another seeking a first win over three miles , is likely to be much closer to @entity15 on friday			1
@entity0 will be saddling three of the ten entries in this year 's steeplechase at @entity7 on @entity8 the trainer , who has also won the race five times with @entity56 and twice with @entity57 , added : ‘ @entity38 probably produced a career best to win the @entity59 at @entity60 last month and the form has worked out well			1
‘ he obviously has to prove he can win over three miles but he is a year older and there is stamina in his pedigree			2
’ both geldings have benefited from treatment for gastric ulcers which @entity0 believes affected their performances last season			2
‘ when @entity15 was fourth in the @entity70 , he wandered under pressure as if something was hurting and even when he won at @entity73 he pulled himself up from the last fence , ’ said @entity0			1
‘ we thought we were missing something , gastro - scoped him and he had grade four ulcers			0
‘ whether it is a footballer , athlete or racehorse you are always trying to eliminate problems			0
’ @entity20 ' @entity1 ( left ) won well in the two - and - a - half - mile @entity36 last month five of the @entity44 line - up were in last year ’s race with @entity88 second , @entity89 , who finished lame , fifth and @entity91 pulled up			1
two fences out , @entity88 still looked the winner but he was ultimately outstayed by @entity15 as his stamina kicked in			2
jockey @entity28 will no doubt attempt to make that happen again on an eight - year - old whose ability to stay — so important because the tempo of the race is invariably demanding — was also crucial as he landed a second @entity99 at @entity100 last month			0
it should prove the difference again			0
having twice been beaten in the race it is hard to see why @entity88 should make it third time lucky but @entity89 , a creditable third in the @entity99 , has frame claims for trainer @entity108 and jockey @entity109			0
the @entity91 of 12 months ago would have no chance but he has proved a different proposition this season			0
a win in last month ’s @entity114 at @entity115 was followed by a two - length second to @entity15 in the @entity99			2
@entity15 clears the last to win the 2013 @entity44 but @entity0 sees that @entity1 is a danger the drying ground conditions is a positive , as they are for his @entity122 - winning stable - mate @entity121 , plus @entity91 has won on all his three runs at @entity7			1
he should give @entity124 , standing in for suspended @entity125 , an exciting ride			0
with @entity128 having failed to recover from the shoulder muscle injury he sustained in a fall at @entity131 on december 13 , trainer @entity127 has called up stable conditional jockey @entity132 to ride @entity133			0
but , admirable though the eight - year - old is , he has looked a few pounds short of this level and the same applies to @entity0 ’s third string , wonderful charm			2
@entity138 steps up in grade after some great runs in handicaps but with his trainer @entity143 struggling badly with his form for most of the last two months , it is hard to see him figuring in the finish .			0

@entity15 is favourite to win the @entity147 on @entity8
trainer @entity0 is wary of the *quality* in *co-runner* @entity1
if @entity15 wins this year 's @entity36 it will be @entity0 ' ninth @entity44 win
