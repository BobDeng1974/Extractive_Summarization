the @entity8 10 's descent module landed by parachute in @entity10 on wednesday with the three crew members said to be in ' good health '			1
it was the second manned mission to the experimental @entity15 space station - launched in 2011 - with @entity3 hoping to have a permanent space presence by 2020			1
the crew had spent 15 days on board the @entity15 prototype space station @entity3 's h - shaped @entity15 space station can be seen in this image , silhouetted against the @entity36 the shot was taken by astrophotographer @entity38 in southern @entity39			1

the country plan to launch the @entity15 2 into orbit in two years , which will then be replaced by a three - module permanent station in 2020			1
the future station will weigh about 60 tonnes , slightly smaller than @entity56 's @entity55 of the 1970s and about one - sixth the size of the 16 - nation @entity58			2
alongside the manned program , @entity3 is developing the long march 5 heavier - lift rocket needed to launch the @entity61			1
it also plans to send a rover to the moon , possibly followed by a crewed lunar mission if officials decide to combine the human spaceflight and lunar exploration programs			0
the @entity30 spacecraft is @entity3 's fifth manned space mission since 2003 and the 15 - day mission was the longest time a manned @entity3 spacecraft has been in orbit			1
it beat @entity73 9 's mission time by two days			2
