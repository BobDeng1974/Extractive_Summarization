by @entity0 for @entity1 a new 24 - hour tube service at weekends will begin in the early hours of september 12 next year to coincide with the start of the @entity4			1
the launch of the ' @entity6 ' will see six trains operating every hour across central @entity9 lines including the @entity10 , @entity11 and jubilee lines			1
the @entity4 tournament will be hosted in 13 venues around the country , including three in @entity9 - @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 - and the new service will provide fans attending these matches , and the expected 400,000 overseas visitors into @entity23 , with additional transport options			1
the 24 - hour tube service was first promised by @entity27 @entity26 and @entity28 last november			1
it will also support @entity9 's businesses , jobs and leisure opportunities			0
in order to meet expected demand , there will be six trains per hour through central @entity9 on all night tube lines , including the jubilee , @entity33 and most of the @entity11 , @entity34 and @entity10 lines			1
on the @entity52 , there will be eight trains per hour to meet demand at busy stations between @entity56 and @entity57			2
mr @entity26 said : ' @entity9 is a bustling , 24 - hour global city and by this time next year we 'll have a 24 - hour tube service to match			1
' running trains all through the night was once thought impossible , but with the huge investment we 've put in and upgrades that have been delivered we stand ready to take the tube to the next level			2
@entity9 mayor @entity26 said : ' @entity9 is a bustling , 24 - hour global city and by this time next year we 'll have a 24 - hour tube service to match ' a map of south east @entity9 showing where the @entity71 line may be extended past @entity73 and @entity74 as far as @entity75 ' as well as creating vital new jobs and giving a huge boost to our economy , the @entity6 will help millions of people to get around our city more easily and quickly			1
the evolution of the @entity6 will without doubt make @entity9 an even better place to live , work , visit and invest			2
' it comes as mr @entity26 recently released proposals for a large extension to the @entity71 line beyond @entity90 through south - east @entity9			0
possible new stops south could include @entity92 and @entity93 to @entity94 , @entity95 , @entity96 and @entity97			0
earlier this year mr @entity26 was accused of breaking promises he had made stating there would be no @entity28 ticketing office closures			0
the planned office closures this year - which were strongly opposed by the unions - were one of the key issues that led to strikes widely condemned by mr @entity26 and @entity28 leaders			2
mr @entity26 has said he hopes to prevent such strikes occurring in future by introducing rules requiring a majority of union members to vote in favour of the strike			0
existing rules mean unions can order industrial action be securing only a majority among members who vote in a ballot			0
however , his proposed extension to the @entity71 line has been highly anticipated			0
the upgrade , which will extend past @entity90 into south - east @entity9 , is expected to relieve congestion on @entity125 routes into the @entity126 and generate about Â£ 400 in annual economic benefits			0
however the upgrade would not occur until 2040			0
however , if it were to go ahead it is not expected to be upgraded until 2040			0
@entity131 , managing director of @entity28 , said : ' we are now less than a year away from the first ever 24 - hour services operating on @entity28			1
already over half a million @entity134 use the tube after 10pm on fridays and saturdays , and the introduction of the @entity6 , which will cut journey times and open up new possibilities across the night time economy , is a historic step in our modernisation of the @entity28			1
@entity143 , leader of the @entity145 rail union , said the organisation welcomed the 24 - hour service but wanted to ensure it was not going to be a ' low cost , low maintenance ' service			1
he said : ' with @entity26 still wanting to axe 900 jobs and close all ticket offices , we want to ensure that the new service is properly staffed to ensure safe and secure travel for all passengers and that weekend maintenance work is not postponed to disrupt weekday services			2
' news of the 24 - hour was met with cynicism from @entity161 , @entity125 , @entity162 and @entity164 general secretary , who claimed it was a ' diversion ' from the mayor 's ' massive cuts and closures programme that will axe a thousand staff and decimate services and safety '			1
relations between @entity173 and @entity28 have been tense in recent months with a series of strikes organised			0
in may , a three - day strike that would have crippled parts of the train network was called off at the last minute following constructive talks .			0

new 24 - hour weekend tube service will begin on september 12 next year
launched in time to help the projected 400,000 @entity4 visitors
the ' @entity6 ' will include @entity185 , @entity33 , @entity11 and @entity10 lines
