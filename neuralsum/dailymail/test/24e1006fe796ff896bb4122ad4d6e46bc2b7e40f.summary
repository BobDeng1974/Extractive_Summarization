@entity1 boss @entity0 is in no doubt it is high time the club brought their run of fruitless trips to @entity8 to an end			1
since gaining promotion to the @entity12 in 2008 , the @entity10 have played @entity13 away eight times in all competitions and lost on every occasion			1
they did win their last visit to the @entity20 ' ground previous to that , a @entity23 triumph in 1995 , but it is not since a 1 - 1 draw between the two sides in 1984 that @entity1 have claimed a point there			0
@entity1 manager @entity0 says his side must end their barren run at @entity13 @entity30 ( right ) celebrates as @entity13 beat @entity1 3 - 0 on their most recent visit to @entity8 adding to that in saturday 's 5.30pm clash at the stadium certainly looks a tall order - leaders @entity13 have won 11 and drawn three of their 14 home league games this season			1
but @entity0 , who has seen his 10th - placed side notch victories at the likes of @entity42 and @entity43 already this term , is adamant @entity1 must address their poor @entity8 record			1
former @entity13 striker @entity0 said : ' it 's not easy			1
our record there has n't been great - but that could be said of most clubs in the @entity12 recently			0
' i 'm told that the last time we got a positive result there ( in the league ) was 1984 and my first - team coach ( @entity55 ) was in goal for @entity13			0
' i do n't know what that says about the quality of @entity1 in those days - or if it questions the ability of my first - team coach ! @entity1 forward @entity63 is expected to shake off a calf knock in time to be available @entity65 is set to return to the squad after missing five games because of a hamstring problem ' but it has been a long time and we need to address that			2
we have been able to go to the likes of @entity42 and @entity43 this year ( and get results ) and our away form for the most part has been good			0
' we have proved to ourselves that we can go to top clubs and get positive results , and hopefully we will do more of the same at the weekend			0
' @entity1 forward @entity63 is expected to shake off a calf knock in time to be available for saturday 's contest and defender @entity65 is set to return to the matchday squad after missing five games because of a hamstring problem			2
the @entity10 also have @entity84 fit again - but he will not be able to feature this weekend as the opposition is the on - loan winger 's parent club .			0

@entity1 have lost all eight trips to @entity13 since @entity12 return
@entity0 *insists* that their fruitless @entity8 visits must end
@entity13 *unbeaten* in 14 @entity12 home games this season ( 11 wins )
