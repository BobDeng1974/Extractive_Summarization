on february 14 , 1998 , new kid on the block @entity2 scored a hat - trick for @entity4 in a 3 - 3 draw with @entity6 at @entity7			1
doing so on the most romantic day of the year was fitting for the division 's newest heartthrob			0
the expectation surrounding @entity2 escalated , and the intro for the next day 's report in the @entity13 said it all : ' @entity15 have @entity16			2
@entity4 , and now @entity17 , have @entity2			1
' @entity2 was the new kid on the block in the @entity19 and scored three at @entity7 in 1998 @entity2 celebrates as he scores his hat - trick against @entity21 wednesday on february 14 , 1998 @entity17 's young striker @entity2 makes a run during the @entity24 against @entity25 in @entity26 @entity2 lets rip his shot that saw the @entity17 starlet score against @entity25 at the @entity24 @entity2 celebrates his goal at @entity26 ' 98 as he went on to deal with the expectation placed on his shoulders 1997 - 98 : 36 appearances , 18 goals 1998 - 99 : 30 appearances , 18 goals best ever season total : 19 2014 - 15 : 26 appearances , 19 goals 2015 - 16 : @entity38 best ever season total : 19 ( and counting ) it was a lot for young shoulders to take , yet four - and - a - half months later he scored that goal against @entity25 at @entity26 ' 98			1
other @entity17 strikers created a similar hype			2
@entity47 was one , @entity48 another			0
and now @entity49 is dividing opinion			2
some believe he will be the next name jotted on that prestigious list , others think he will be found out			0
this is where @entity49 can take note of @entity2			1
it was he who , in 1997 - 98 , scored 18 goals in 36 appearances in the @entity19			1
he kept it up at the @entity24 , and did so the season after , too , scoring 18 goals again but in six fewer @entity19 appearances			2
he never looked at the opposition as @entity65 , or @entity66 , or even @entity25			0
' from one game to the next , i did n't even know who i was playing against – they were just names on a teamsheet , not big reputations , and that innocence served me well , ' @entity2 once said			2
@entity49 has been just as fearless this year			0
the expectation on him is up there with @entity2 , and @entity47 , and @entity48			0
yet he must , at the very least , do it for another season ; prove it is not a fluke , or a one - off , before he can even be considered a reason for @entity17 supporters to be chipper			2
@entity49 came on as a substitute to make his senior @entity17 debut by replacing @entity47 @entity49 celebrates scoring for @entity17 during his senior debut at @entity86 against @entity87 @entity49 will try to prove his outstanding @entity19 season is not a fluke this year 3 - no player had ever won @entity91 three times in a row ... but @entity49 tied with @entity94 and @entity16 after winning it in january and february 19 - @entity49 has matched @entity2 's best - ever total for a @entity19 season 22 - @entity49 's 19 goals have directly contributed 22 points to @entity101 's 56 total 25 - @entity49 has won the same amount of tackles as @entity104 this season 40 - @entity49 's 22 goals in 40 appearances in the @entity19 beats @entity2 's 20 500 - @entity49 was 500/1 to be win the @entity107 this season even so , that does not mean he should n't be celebrated , or that he ca n't do it			1
@entity49 , after all , has matched @entity2 's 19 goals in 2001 - 02 and 2002 - 03 – the @entity113 co-commentator ’s best - ever total in a @entity19 season – with eight games to spare			1
his 22 goals in his first 40 appearances beats @entity2 ’s 20 , too			2
@entity49 's goals have contributed 22 points to @entity101 alone , taking them from a losing position to a winning one against @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity66 , and so on			1
they ’d be 14th without			0
nobody , by the way , had ever won the @entity91 award three consecutive times			2
@entity94 won it in august and september , 1997			0
@entity16 won it in november and december , 2006			0
@entity49 went desperately close to a third following five goals in march , only for @entity66 ’s @entity131 to deny him			1
even so , being mentioned in the same breath as @entity94 and @entity16 will do the man who was struggling for a place in the @entity121 team just two years ago			0
@entity49 celebrates scoring against @entity122 for @entity101 in the @entity19 at @entity136 @entity49 went desperately close to a third straight @entity137 - which has never been done before @entity49 and @entity104 have – coincidentally – played 1,876 minutes each this season , and here 's how they compare : tackles won : 25 - @entity49 25 - @entity142 tackles lost : 30 - @entity49 37 - @entity142 the @entity101 product – 6ft 2in with hair slicked back and a traditional look about him – seems an old - fashioned centre forward			1
he was 500/1 at the beginning of the season to win the @entity107 , and is not just another also - ran			1
in @entity150 and @entity151 , he is rivalling one man who cost @entity153 £ 32million , and another who won @entity154 the title three years ago			0
analysing his style of play , however , is n't easy			0
he is n't known for having pace like @entity2 , or a cannon of a right foot like @entity48 , or dribbling like @entity151 , or a bravado like @entity150 – yet @entity49 appears a @entity162			2
ten goals with his right foot , five with his left , four with his head – he ’s a right - place - at - the - right - time kind of striker , which never hurts			0
he ’s precise , too , having had the third-most shots on target in the @entity19 this year , behind @entity151 and @entity122 striker @entity171			0
@entity49 has had the third-most @entity19 shots on target , behind @entity151 and @entity171 @entity49 appears a right - place - at - the - right - time kind of striker who is a @entity162 on the pitch 88 - @entity151 , @entity154 81 - @entity179 , @entity180 65 - @entity171 , @entity122 63 - @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity154 62 - @entity183 , @entity184 61 - @entity49 , @entity101 58 - @entity185 , @entity65 58 - @entity186 , @entity187 57 - @entity150 , @entity153 55 - @entity188 , @entity189 47 - @entity151 , @entity154 43 - @entity171 , @entity122 37 - @entity49 , @entity101 36 - @entity150 , @entity153 35 - @entity183 , @entity184 35 - @entity190 , @entity66 33 - @entity181 , @entity154 31 - @entity185 , @entity65 29 - @entity179 , @entity180 28 - @entity188 , @entity189 @entity49 's heat maps against @entity121 ( left ) and @entity66 ( right ) show he 's active in both halves and do n’t forget persistent			1
consider the top 20 most distances covered by players during a @entity19 match , and @entity49 features twice ( 13.01km vs @entity184 , and 13.12km vs @entity182 )			1
it 's no wonder his heat maps ( above ) show him active from one half to the other			0
even chanelling his inner defender , @entity49 has made as many tackles ( 25 ) as @entity154 captain @entity104 this season in the same amount of minutes ( 1,876 ) – and has lost fewer			1
yet @entity204 proved more difficult to handle than @entity205 , or @entity121 , or @entity122			0
@entity49 was given a hard time by @entity207 – a foul after 19 seconds serving as an unofficial welcome to international football – but he has had that treatment before			1
not by the @entity212 , but by @entity153 captain @entity213			0
the @entity215 final at @entity86 was among his more difficult afternoons , @entity49 admitted in an exclusive interview with @entity218 previously , and it will only get harder			0
@entity49 was closely marked by @entity204 's @entity207 in what was a taster of what 's to come from defenders @entity207 often had his arms wrapped around @entity49 during set pieces in @entity17 's friendly with @entity204 in @entity224 @entity49 was barely given an inch by @entity207 during the international friendly and he can expect it to continue defenders catch on quick , and he will be marked intensely , as per @entity207 and @entity213 ’s taster			1
can his remarkable form continue for another season , and the one after that , and so on ? @entity49 must avoid what happened to @entity234 – a player who fell off the radar almost as quickly as he came on to it			2
@entity234 hit 12 goals for @entity238 in his first @entity19 season by february 2002 to earn his @entity17 debut against @entity241 that same month , yet the striker did not score for the rest of the season and never reached double figures for a club in the league again			1
what @entity49 does n't want is to become the answer to a pub quiz question that asks which player scored 25 - plus goals in 2014 - 15 , only to never be seen again ? only he can make sure that does n’t happen , and it begins with a half - decent 2015 - 16			1
@entity234 hit 12 goals for @entity238 in his first @entity19 season by february 2002 he did not score for the rest of the season and never reached double figures for a club in the league again @entity49 will try to avoid becoming a one - hit wonder in the @entity19 and it starts with next season distance data courtesy of the @entity261 , the @entity262 of the @entity19			1
