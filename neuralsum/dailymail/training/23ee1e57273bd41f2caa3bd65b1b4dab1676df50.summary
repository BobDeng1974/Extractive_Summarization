ambulance chiefs were accused last night of risking patients ’ lives to meet response time targets			1
one trust may have hastened the deaths of dozens of desperately ill people by downgrading emergency call - outs to non-urgent			2
this freed them from hitting a response time target of eight minutes			0
at least 57 were not taken to hospital and died			1
some of those downgraded had a terminal illness or a ‘ do not resuscitate ’ order			2
it emerged last night that another major ambulance trust – @entity26 – is also suspected of recategorising thousands of urgent cases			1
managers made the calls ‘ non-urgent ’ when they realised ambulances were not going to reach patients inside the eight - minute window			1
@entity34 , of the @entity36 - based campaign group action on ambulances , said : ‘ they are playing @entity39 roulette with patients ’ lives			1
‘ what is most shocking with @entity43 is the way patients who were near the end of life were treated			2
they were deciding on patients ’ quality of life and whether they died then or in dignity a few months later			1
' a lot of pressure ' : health secretary @entity55 said the number of ambulances dispatched within eight minutes had increased by 22 per cent this year ‘ any of those families will be questioning whether their loved ones ’ lives could have been extended by a few months			1
’ paramedics say they are so overstretched they often rely on firemen and police officers to take patients to hospital			2
@entity67 figures last week showed that eight out of ten ambulance trusts in @entity69 miss the target for responding to life - threatening calls			1
extra demand is driven by an ageing population and lack of out - of - hours gp care			0
ambulance crews also regularly find themselves having to queue outside casualty because staff are too busy to accept them			2
one paramedic , based in the @entity80 , said demand had grown by 6 per cent a year over the past decade			0
he added : ‘ it ’s awful			0
i think it ’s on the verge of collapse			0
we ’re getting stuck at hospitals and we ca n’t respond to patients			2
’ yesterday an internal investigation by @entity16 found that in january and february last year managers agreed to downgrade calls involving terminally ill patients			1
rather than being sent an ambulance within eight minutes , these patients were made to wait between 20 and 50 minutes			1
and in some cases ambulances crews were not sent at all and relatives were just given advice on the phone			2
the guidance had not been approved by the trust ’s most senior management and was flagged up by concerned staff			0
@entity103 , the ambulance service ’s chief executive , said he immediately launched an investigation and ordered the reversal of the changes			1
a leaked document last month revealed proposals to extend the window for emergency calls deemed slightly less serious from eight minutes to 19 minutes			1
the issue was raised in the @entity113 yesterday by @entity115 health spokesman @entity114 ( centre ) who blamed ambulance rationing on the growing pressure on accident and emergency wards the issue was raised in the @entity113 yesterday by @entity115 health spokesman @entity114 who said : ‘ withholding ambulances from terminally ill people is the most cruel form of rationing imaginable			1
’ health secretary @entity55 said the number of ambulances dispatched within eight minutes had increased by 22 per cent this year and the service was ‘ doing very well under a lot of pressure ’			1
last week an unprecedented 13 hospitals declared major incidents because they were unable to cope with the huge volume of patients in casualty			2
ambulance crews in the north of @entity69 have been forced to make 170 - mile round trips as 999 provisions reached breaking point			1
the @entity140 deployed two emergency vehicles from @entity142 to @entity143 overnight last monday			0
they were dispatched to help with several life - threatening 999 calls made in the area			1
however , the move stretched other crews serving in @entity142 , with a smaller pool of ambulances having to cover a greater area as a result			2
@entity154 , a @entity140 paramedic and @entity156 representative for @entity142 and @entity157 , branded the move ' unacceptable '			0
the @entity140 deployed two ambulances from @entity160 and @entity161 to @entity143 to cope with a surge in demand ' surely there were other crews in @entity157 that would have been able to come from @entity167 , @entity168 or @entity169 , ' he said			2
' to take two ambulances from @entity142 to help out in @entity143 just does n't make sense			0
' it 's not unusual for crews from @entity142 to respond to 999 calls in @entity157			1
this is usually when they have been called from a hospital after transporting a patient			0
' however , when it is 86 miles away we have to ask why were n't other ambulances closer called , especially as @entity142 is already one of the worst performing areas for response targets			0
' a spokesman for @entity140 said the seven other 24/7 crews based further east in @entity142 could not be sent to @entity143 as they were too busy			0
he said : ' occasionally there is a need to move resources to cope with high demand in a particular area			0
' the decision to deploy two vehicles from the @entity160 and @entity161 areas on the night of january 5 and early hours on january 6 was due to an increase in demand			0
' on the night , the vehicles in the @entity199 area , dealt with a high number of immediately life - threatening emergency calls			0
' resources are not restricted to areas			0
we constantly monitor activity against the demand and then decide whether extra resources are required			0
' every patient who needed an ambulance in @entity142 during those hours was responded to			0
' @entity140 has experienced a huge increase in demand so far this year as @entity214 departments continue to struggle with high demand			1
between january 1 and 11 , @entity140 received 12,813 emergency calls in @entity142 and @entity157 - up roughly a quarter compared to the same period last year .			0
