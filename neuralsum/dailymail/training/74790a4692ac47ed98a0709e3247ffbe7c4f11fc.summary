leading @entity1 ceos , angered by the @entity4 administration 's challenge to certain ' workplace wellness ' programs , are threatening to side with @entity7 forces unless the government backs off , according to people familiar with the matter			1
major @entity1 corporations have broadly supported president @entity4 's healthcare reform despite concerns over several of its elements , largely because it included provisions encouraging the wellness programs			1
the programs aim to control healthcare costs by reducing smoking , obesity , hypertension and other risk factors that can lead to expensive illnesses			0
a bipartisan provision in the 2010 healthcare reform law allows employers to reward workers who participate and penalize those who do n't			2
the lawsuits infuriated some large employers so much that they are considering aligning themselves with @entity4 's opponents , according to people familiar with the executives ' thinking			1
' the fact that the @entity37 sued is shocking to our members , ' said @entity54 , vice-president and counsel at the @entity56 , a group of chief executives of more than 200 large @entity1 corporations			1
' they do n't understand why a plan in compliance with the @entity62 ) is the target of a lawsuit , " she said			0
' this is a major issue to our members			0
' she then added , ' there have been conversations at the most senior levels of the administration about this			2
' business roundtable members are due to meet @entity4 in a closed - door session on tuesday , where they may air their concerns			1
it is not clear how many members of the group , whose companies sponsor health insurance for 40 million people , are considering any action			2
it is also not clear if the @entity85 can stop the @entity37 from challenging wellness programs			1
angered : @entity54 ( above ) , vice-president and counsel at the @entity89 , which represents over 200 corporations , is due to meet @entity4 in aclosed - door session on tuesday @entity44 allows financial incentives for workers taking part in workplace wellness programs of up to 50 percent of their monthly premiums , deductibles , and other costs			1
that translates into hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars in extra annual costs for those who do not participate			0
typically , participation means filling out detailed health questionnaires , undergoing medical screenings , and in some cases attending weight - loss or smoking - cessation programs			1
one of the arguments presented in the lawsuit against three employers is that requiring medical testing violates the @entity1 with @entity113			1
the lawsuits are based on the view that it is no longer voluntary if employees face up to $ 4,000 in penalties for non-participation , loss of insurance or even their jobs			0
employers , however , see the lawsuits as reneging on the administration 's commitment to an important part of the healthcare reform			0
in practical terms , large corporations have several ways to undermine @entity44 if they decide to			1
one is to support legal challenges to the subsidies given to low - income individuals who buy health insurance on the federal exchange established under the law			1
neither the @entity56 nor any of its ceo members have done this so far			0
another option is to make top executives available for hearings on repealing or diluting @entity44			2
' we never did this before , ' said the person familiar with the executives ' thinking			0
' but they could turn up the noise			0
i do n't think the @entity85 would want the @entity150 turning on them and supporting these efforts on the @entity152			2
' the nuclear option would be to radically change employer - sponsored health insurance			0
large corporations are highly unlikely to eliminate it , but they might give workers a fixed amount of money to buy coverage on a private insurance exchange			0
that would allow employers , almost all of which pay workers ' medical claims out of their earnings , to cap their healthcare spending .			0

many ceos are angry with the @entity4 administration thanks to three new cases challenging parts of his ' wellness program '
in order to participate in the ' wellness program ' and receive a low health care rate under @entity44 , employees must take a **physical**
now it is being argued in three cases that forcing someone to take a **physical** for work violates the @entity1 with @entity113
the @entity150 now have a number of ways they can undermine @entity4 because of this *development*
