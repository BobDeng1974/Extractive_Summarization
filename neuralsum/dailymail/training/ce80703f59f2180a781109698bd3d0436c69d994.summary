one police union is pushing for cop killings to be included in the federal hate crimes law			2
the @entity3 is asking that crimes against police be added to the @entity7 hate crimes statute			1
a hate crime is currently defined by @entity7 as a ' criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender ’s bias against a race , religion , disability , ethnic origin or sexual orientation			1
' this comes in the wake of the recent killing of two cops in @entity25			0
according to the @entity43 , ' 21.7 percent of non-accidental law enforcement deaths since 2004 were ambush attacks			1
' @entity45 reports that the @entity46 , which has 300,000 members , wrote a letter to @entity7 and president @entity28 this week addressing their concerns			0
' right now , it ’s a hate crime if you attack someone solely because of the color of their skin , but it ought to be a hate crime if you attack someone solely because of the color of their uniform as well , ' said executive director @entity61			2
@entity63 press secretary @entity62 said when asked about the initiative it was ' something that we 'll have to consider			0
' speaking out : ' it ought to be a hate crime if you attack someone solely because of the color of their uniform as well , ' said executive director of the union @entity61 ( above ) the hate crime statue has been expanded before , most recently in 2009 when disabilities and sexual orientation were added by @entity7			1
it is still not certain who in @entity7 might take up this bill , especially as violent deaths of police officers on duty have dropped drastically from just a few decades ago			2
that being said , the group is still intent on getting harsher penalties for those that take down officers in the line of duty			0
said the union 's president , @entity27 ; ' enough is enough ! it ’s time for @entity7 to do something to protect the men and women who protect us			0
