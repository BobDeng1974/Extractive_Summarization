by @entity0 published : 11:27 est , 24 may 2012 updated : 12:09 est , 24 may 2012 inexperienced driver : @entity2 a novice driver was killed when she misread her satnav and drove into the path of oncoming traffic on a dual carriageway			1
inexperienced @entity2 collided head - on collision with a @entity9 after driving the wrong way down a slip road after she misunderstood the satnav 's instruction to take the first left exit on a roundabout			1
failing to spot the ' no entry ' signs , the 21 - year - old ended up driving against the traffic flow on a 70mph road , directly into the path of driver @entity22			1
at an inquest into @entity27 's death , mr @entity23 told the coroner 's court he had ' absolutely no time ' to react			1
@entity31 was told that @entity27 , who had only been behind the wheel for three months , had set off for a friend ’s house in darkness on december 11 last year			1
on her 16 - mile journey she came to a roundabout near @entity38 , @entity39 , where her satnav told her to take the first left turn and she drove straight into the path of oncoming traffic			1
@entity31 was told @entity27 ’s @entity44 collided head - on with @entity22 ’s convertible @entity9 on the 70mph road			1
miss @entity27 , a barmaid from nearby @entity47 , died that night at @entity48 while mr @entity23 suffered a broken ankle and fractured spine			2
mr @entity23 , 49 , from @entity51 : ' i saw what looked like strong headlights coming towards me			2
' they were on my side of the dual carriageway			2
there was absolutely no time for me to react			2
' after the accident pc @entity60 , from @entity61 , used a satnav to follow the same route @entity64 had taken			2
wrong turn : the inquest heard how @entity27 could have missed the no entry signs at the roundabout slip road ( pictured ) he added : ' the device said cross the roundabout at the first exit , the first lawful exit being @entity74			1
' the signage on the exit slip road is quite high so if you missed the two signs on the flyover bridge you may miss those			1
' if @entity64 was unfamiliar with that junction she may have had a momentary lapse in her concentration			2
' he added once @entity27 was on the @entity85 she may have thought she was travelling the correct way along a single - carriageway			0
the @entity88 have since improved signage at the junction			0
however miss @entity27 's mother @entity91 , 45 , is calling for young drivers to be trained in using satnavs to stop a similar tragedy happening again			0
avoidable accident : miss @entity27 's mother is calling for young drivers to be trained in using satnavs to stop a similar tragedy happening again she said after the inquest : ' she was going to pick her friend up but did not know where she was going			0
' she heard the voice of the satnav and took it literally			0
she was a very inexperienced driver			0
' @entity104 are a help to youngsters on the road who do n’t know where they are going but young drivers have so much to think about			1
' if they are following the sat - nav they ca n’t always be aware of the road			1
if they sat - nav tells you to get off there you just think it ’s telling you the right thing			0
' she believed she was doing the right thing and did n’t question it			0
i think the use of sat - navs should be included in some way in driving lessons			1
