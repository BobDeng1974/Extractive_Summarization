the @entity0 is no longer the ' bastion ' of correct @entity2 on radio and television , one of its editors has admitted			1
thousands of viewers and listeners now complain to the corporation every year saying its once - high standards of grammar and pronunciation have slipped			1
@entity15 , who is the @entity0 newsroom 's ' style editor ' , conceded his presenters and reporters repeatedly make basic errors , such as confusing the word ' historic ' with ' historical ' and using the term ' chair ' when they mean ' chairman ' or ' chairwoman '			1
@entity15 , who is the @entity0 newsroom 's ' style editor ' , conceded his presenters and reporters repeatedly make basic errors , such as confusing the word ' historic ' with ' historical ' following recent criticisms that presenters are also mispronouncing the letter ' h ' , he called on the @entity0 's senior management to prioritise efforts to make the corporation a linguistic ' standard bearer ' once more			1
appearing on @entity34 , he said : ' there are thousands of people who get in touch with us every year because of our output on radio and television and on the internet			1
' and the thing that people often point out is that they look to the @entity0 to uphold standards			1
so i do think that we used to be a standard bearer in these matters			0
' whether that ’s the case now i ’m not so sure			0
i would love to see someone at the top of the @entity0 take up the challenge and put the emphasis back on the quality of our language so we can once again be a leader for the people who look to us			1
' they think the @entity0 is the bastion and i would like to see us back at that position			1
' mr @entity15 was asked to respond to a string of complaints received in the past week by @entity34			2
one listener , @entity67 , contacted the programme to complain about @entity0 reports into the resignations of @entity71 and @entity72 from the government 's sex abuse inquiry			1
he said : ' the other day it was reported that the child abuse enquiry had lost two chairs			0
today we were told that two chairs had stepped down			0
whatever next , " chairs found legless " ? or worse , " two chairs table motions " ? ' following recent criticisms that presenters are also mispronouncing the letter ' h ' , he called on the @entity0 's senior management to prioritise efforts to make the corporation a linguistic ' standard bearer ' once more mr @entity15 agreed it was incorrect to describe somebody as a ' chair ' rather than a ' chairman ' or ' chairwoman '			1
he added : ' i think it ’s one of the side effects of what we like to call political correctness			0
but i do n’t really see the need for it and we do n’t advocate using it			0
we think if a man ’s a chairman , he ’s a chairman			2
a woman ’s a chairwoman			2
' if you know the gender of a person then there are quite good options there			0
' another listener complained about the repeated confusion of the word ' historic ' , which should be used to describe an important event , and ' historical ' , which simply means an event took place in the past			2
he said newspapers , police forces and even the judiciary have also made the same error , adding : ' so it is one of those phrases that has seeped into our consciousness			0
we never used to use it and now we are not sure which it should be and tend to get it wrong			0
' mr @entity15 said he ' occasionally ' tells off presenters for making grammatical mistakes , but said listeners and viewers should be more understanding of errors that creep into live broadcasts			1
he said : ' the @entity0 produces hundreds of hours of broadcasting every day , much of it live			2
not every word is perfect			0
we would be concerned if writers were getting things wrong			0
' i think we have to allow staff a little bit of leeway in the live broadcasting that makes up so much of our output			0
' last month , the @entity0 was criticised by the @entity151 for allowing presenters including @entity153 and @entity155 @entity154 to say ' haitch ' instead of ' aitch ' when referring to the letter ' h '			1
it said such mistakes marked the beginning of a ' slippery slope ' , but the @entity0 said it was proud of the ' range of voices ' across its programmes .			2
