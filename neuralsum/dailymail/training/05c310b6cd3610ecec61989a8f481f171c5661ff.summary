the judge in the @entity2 trial has formally ordered the @entity3 to undergo psychiatric evaluation to establish whether he was criminally responsible on the night he killed his girlfriend			1
judge @entity7 told @entity2 he must report to @entity10 's @entity9 hospital , one of @entity13 's top mental institutions , as an outpatient for up to 30 days , starting on may 26			1
the judge named three of the experts - one for the defence and two appointed by the court - who will test whether @entity2 was ' capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his action '			1
the results could offer a way for the double amputee to beat both the murder charge and a lesser one of culpable homicide ( similar to manslaughter ) if the court is convinced he was not of sound mind when he shot @entity32			1
@entity2 must attend the hospital at 9am every weekday and will be evaluated by a panel of four mental health experts			1
he can leave every day at 4pm or when allowed by hospital authorities			1
judge @entity7 ruled that @entity2 's period of observation will not be more than 30 days			1
the ruling after an expert told the trial that he suffered from an anxiety disorder that made him ' hyper - vigilant '			2
festival atmosphere : local artists sing a tune called @entity65 ? outside the high court in @entity10 psychiatrist dr @entity68 , for the defence , said that @entity2 's condition is linked to his disability and meant that he was prone to fight , rather than take flight , in the presence of perceived danger			2
it means that the trial - already on its 33rd day - will now be delayed until june 30			1
the decision by @entity77 followed a request for a psychiatric evaluation by the chief prosecutor , @entity80			2
mr @entity80 questioned why the defense decided to ask dr @entity68 to testify on behalf of the @entity84 runner			2
he has suggested that the trial is not going well for @entity2 and that his lawyers are floating the idea that a disorder contributed to @entity32 's shooting and that therefore @entity2 bears less responsibility for her death			2
@entity2 says he mistook @entity32 for an intruder when he shot her through the closed door of a toilet cubicle			0
prosecutors say he killed her in anger after an argument			0
in asking for another professional evaluation of @entity2 's mental state , @entity99 appeared to be trying to ward off any attempt by the defense to say @entity2 should be treated favorably by the court because of a mental condition linked to his disability			1
professor @entity107 , head of psychology at @entity109 , explained to @entity110 more about the condition that it 's claimed @entity2 has			0
' hyper - vigilance is more of a behavioural symptom of wider psychological problems than an actual psychiatric condition in itself , ' he said			0
' hyper - vigilance is when an individual is in a chronic state of high anxiety and arousal and is constantly scanning their surroundings - the environment they are in , as well as friends and the people they encounter - for threats			0
' this is often as the result of suffering a traumatic or frightening experience			0
after a while this state becomes second nature to the fearful individual and begins to shape their routine behaviours - for example always checking behind closed doors when entering a room , or assessing new places for the nearest emergency exit			0
' those who are hyper - vigilant are often easily startled , suffer from poor sleeping patterns , may have difficulty concentrating , and can be quite quarrelsome , spontaneous and irritable			0
' hyper - vigilance is one of the symptoms required in order for psychiatrists to make a diagnosis of @entity151 ( @entity151 ) alongside other symptoms of intense fear such as avoidance , re-experience , flashbacks and intense arousal			0
' not everyone who suffers traumatic events will go on to develop ptsd or hyper - vigilance , and there may be other underlying personality factors or past experiences that make it more likely to manifest in some rather than others , such as narcissism or high intelligence			0

@entity3 must report to top mental hospital at 9am every weekday
double amputee will be evaluated by four experts until 4pm each day
will decide if he was ' capable of appreciating wrongfulness of his action '
