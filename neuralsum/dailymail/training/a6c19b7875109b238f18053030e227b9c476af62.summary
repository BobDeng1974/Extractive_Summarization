his wife @entity7 was not looking on as he gave his concession , and he did n't even thank his long - plagued wife in his remarks			1
@entity7 was said to be hundreds of miles away in the @entity11 on tuesday night but spotted coming out of the couple 's @entity13 apartment wednesday morning			1
rather than bowing out gracefully , @entity0 decided to throw one final insult at the voters by flipping his middle finger at the crowd as he drove off as captured by @entity19 photographers			0
instead of having his wife at the midtown bar where he and his supporters gathered tuesday night , a different woman was attracting attention : @entity25 , the woman with whom he had a sexting relationship , crashed his party			1

sadly , i was an imperfect messenger			0
' @entity63 was seen wandering around the pub - clearly as an uninvited guest - giving statements to reporters and showing off her widely publicized plastic surgeries including a breast augmentation and a nose job			0
her presence delayed the evening 's festivities as it took @entity0 half an hour to avoid a confrontation and run through a nearby fast food restaurant			2
after stepping down from @entity75 in 2011 following his first sexting scandal , @entity0 was hoping that his campaign for mayor would be his chance to reenter public office and clear his name			1

sadly , i was an imperfect messenger ' @entity45 mayoral hopeful @entity0 greets voters after making his concession speech different kind of support : @entity25 was using the primary attention to promote her new song it was n't work : @entity102 aide @entity7 was in the @entity11 but not with her boss , as former secretary of state and likely presidential hopeful @entity104 was at an event in @entity107 on tuesday @entity2 also voted against another scandal - plagued politician on tuesday as former @entity2 governor @entity110 lost his race for city comptroller			1
even though he and @entity0 were dealt the similar losses , @entity110 had a much more successful campaign as he came within 4 points of @entity116 , the former manhattan borough president who has worked in state politics for the past two decades			2

@entity110 - who like @entity0 , is married - was forced to resign five years ago after he admitted to hiring prostitutes			2
his wife @entity138 was not at the tuesday night event and never made any campaign appearances during his nine - week bid for comptroller			1
' all along we knew it was going to be a close race , ' @entity110 campaign spokeswoman @entity143 told @entity147 at his party tuesday night			1
' yes people know @entity110 and he has name recognition but @entity116 has the entire political establishment behind him - every union , every business			0
' striking a clear contrast to his failed colleagues , @entity31 danced and blew simultaneous kisses to the crowd with his wife and two children at their victory party in @entity161 , @entity30			1
@entity162 won 40.2 per cent of the @entity45 vote , and while there is a chance of a run off between him and the second place candidate , @entity167 , that seems unlikely			2
' you made this campaign a cause , and i say thank you for elevating it to that level , ' the former public advocate said to his supporters			0
victory : even though second - place candidate @entity167 refused to concede saying that there will be a run off , @entity31 ( pictured ) celebrated his 40.2 per cent victory coordinated : @entity31 and his wife @entity181 blew simultaneous kisses at the crowd happy : @entity162 's family was a much of his campaign as he was , with son @entity186 and daughter @entity187 joining him on stage tuesday night at their victory party @entity162 's interracial family was displayed prominently throughout the campaign as he featured his son @entity186 and his large afro in a number of television ads while his daughter @entity187 frequently spoke on her father 's behalf at events , including the victory party last night			1
' some of you may already be familiar with my brother @entity186			0
my brother , my little brother , may look good on tv â€“ but there 's only one de @entity31 who got to vote for her dad today , ' she said , referring to a clip of her condemning current mayor @entity214 's comments about @entity31 using his family as a part of the campaign			2
while many have pegged @entity162 as the ' populist ' candidate who will be facing @entity221 @entity220 in november , @entity186 is undoubtedly the fan - favorite as he had a round of cheers all his own at the @entity30 party			0
' in her enthusiasm @entity187 just attempted to touch the hair			0
security was ready to intervene , ' mr @entity162 joked .			0
