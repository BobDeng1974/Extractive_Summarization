@entity1 manager @entity0 expects @entity3 's rehabilitation from a long - term knee injury to keep him out for at least another six weeks			1
an awkward fall at @entity6 in april saw the 25 - year - old rupture an anterior cruciate ligament , the injury ruling him out of the reckoning for @entity14 's @entity13 squad			1
@entity3 has yet to make his return more than eight months later and , having gone under the knife again last month to clear out his knee , a comeback does not appear imminent			1
the news is a blow to @entity22 's hopes of signing the striker in january			2
' he had to make a step back in his recovery , ' @entity0 said			1
' that was a pity because i remember when we spoke about the squad in the pre-season i said @entity3 will be like a fantastic signing for december or january and he is n't			2
' all these kind of unlucky moments are part of the difficult time that we have			0
' after a big injury , you do n't have to rush			0
he needs time and we give him the time to come back , but it 's a pity because he 's a great player			0
the former @entity56 man made his @entity14 debut against @entity58 at @entity59 in november 2013 ' it 's always difficult now because it 's not good to fix on a special date to come back			1
he 's now making steps forwards and he needs more time and that 's the most important			0
' to fix a date makes pressure on the player and the medical staff			0
' while keen not to say when @entity3 would make his comeback , @entity0 did admit a return before february was unlikely			1
' i think now , in this situation , he will not be available before the end of january , ' he said			0
' no , no. ' @entity3 is one of a host of players unavailable for the visit of @entity25 this weekend , with @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 also sidelined by injury			2
@entity83 , @entity84 and @entity85 are suspended for the @entity87 's encounter , while @entity88 and @entity89 are doubts			0
key midfielder @entity83 ( right ) is suspended for the clash against @entity25 the string of absentees means @entity0 will be relying on @entity1 's much - vaunted youth system to help end a five - match losing streak			1
@entity0 said @entity96 would ' probably ' start his first @entity98 match on saturday , while @entity99 is pushing to join him			2
@entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 are others vying for a place in the squad to face @entity25 as @entity1 look to end their worst losing run of the 21st century .			0
