the art of management is to create an aura , to brainwash the players into believing that they can routinely beat a team every bit as good as @entity6			1
it is to inspire , to send @entity9 ’s players into the tunnel at the @entity11 in the minutes before kick - off and look down their noses at @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 or @entity17			2
out on the training pitches , where the real work is done , the coaches must come up with a plan to squeeze the pips out of the players over two legs in the @entity24			2
@entity28 coach @entity27 took his team to the @entity24 final at @entity31 against @entity32 ; last year @entity33 reached the final under their clever coach @entity35			1
unfortunately for @entity36 , he has come up short			1
this is no disgrace and there is no need to make his life a misery just because he can not find a way to beat @entity6			2
he just is n’t good enough			0
@entity36 has not taken @entity9 forward and looked clueless in the @entity11 @entity36 could not alter the game or put the shackles on @entity6 as @entity9 's @entity47 dream died @entity48 lifts the ball over the onrushing @entity50 and into the empty net to give @entity6 the advantage read @entity54 's match report from the @entity11 as @entity6 beat @entity9 1 - 0 to progress to the quarter - finals of the @entity24			1
the temptation , in the shakedown that will follow this @entity24 elimination for yet another @entity61 club , is to start over again			2
in the aftermath the cry now will be to send for @entity35 , to send for @entity64 , to send for @entity65 , or to send for someone else to have a go			0
the brutal truth is that it ’s coming to that			0
@entity32 ’s exalted coach @entity70 was here , settling down to watch his former club pass @entity9 off the park in a series of dizzying spells			2
possession football is anathema to @entity61 football			0
@entity9 spilt their guts here , exposing the size of the task to turn the current champions of the @entity83 into a team capable of living with a group of players who can change the pace of a game at will			1
@entity6 ’s tempo is soothing and reassuring			2
if @entity9 want to dominate in @entity90 , in a way that @entity6 did when they won the @entity24 in 2006 , 2009 and 2011 , then @entity36 is not the man			1
since he arrived at @entity9 he has had four chances to beat @entity6 and has yet to even secure a draw			1
team and coach are not up to it			0
city need innovation , a man with stature and the confidence to redevelop the team with some clever signings over the next couple of years			1
what @entity9 would give for a player like @entity14 , and you feel they would have to pay the earth @entity14 glides past @entity109 during another masterful display from the little @entity111 @entity112 resorts to desperate measures to stop a free - flowing @entity14 @entity14 attempts to dribble past @entity50 as the @entity6 man shows his mastery once more the @entity9 wall attempts to do its job as @entity14 fires in a free - kick that dressing room is n’t right , it ca n’t be when a player of @entity124 ’s supposed class can play as badly as this on a big night back at the @entity11			1
he gave up on his man @entity48 as he roamed into @entity9 ’s penalty area and the ball inevitably needed up in the back of @entity50 ’s net			1
that aside , @entity50 was immense here			0
if this is to be a slow , painful death for @entity36 , then the job is to breathe some life into this team for the final nine games of the league season			1
@entity138 this weekend is some homecoming			0
they will need leadership in the run - in , something that was missing from the sidelines as @entity15 and @entity48 splayed the ball out to the wings for @entity17 and @entity14 to slice their way through @entity9 ’s defence			0
at times it was shambolic back there			0
when you come up against @entity14 , the three - time winner of the @entity153 , it is down to the coach to come up with a specific tactic to stifle his impact			0
here he set up the goal for @entity48 with a ball that had a golfer ’s draw on it when it pinged off his left boot to meet the @entity6 midfielder ’s run at the back post			0
@entity167 reacts after seeing his late penalty saved by @entity170 ter - @entity169 @entity171 goes to ground after challenging @entity169 as as @entity124 looks on both @entity172 ( left ) and @entity173 play the blame game during the defeat in @entity6 @entity167 ’s miss from the penalty spot in the 78th minute is no more than a footnote because @entity9 were outclassed over two legs			1
the main man in @entity181 will demand answers , a natural consequence of another premature elimination in the @entity24			2
to @entity36 ’s great credit , he is always unmoved by the speculation about his future , but the ball is now in @entity190 ’s court			0
sadly for a man of integrity and honour , he has lost his appeal .			0

at the elite level of @entity198 *competition* , @entity9 boss @entity36 has come up short . not once , but every single time
if @entity9 want to dominate @entity90 , in a way that @entity6 did when they won the @entity24 in 2009 and 2011 , then @entity36 is not their man
city need innovation , a man with the stature and the confidence to redevelop this team and take them to the next level
@entity36 : defeat at @entity6 is not a *failure* , it is a *disappointment*
