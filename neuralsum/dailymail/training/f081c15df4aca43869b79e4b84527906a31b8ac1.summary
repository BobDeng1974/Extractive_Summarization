an attorney for the family of the teenager found dead inside a rolled up wrestling mat today claimed an expert analysis suggests the released @entity6 footage was doctored to blur a figure walking near the corpse			1
@entity9 , 17 , was found dead in the gym at @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 in january			1
while some of the footage is clear , the camera pointed toward the mat is blurry doctored ? @entity29 , a @entity9 family attorney , told @entity30 today that an expert took a close look at the video footage captured by motion - activated cameras and discovered ¿ a very suspicious image ¿ but @entity9 ’s family suspected foul play , claimed the police have taken part in a cover - up all along and have been campaigning for justice ever since			1
part of their campaign has been to fight for surveillance footage from the gym on the day @entity9 died to be released			2
his parents reported him missing that evening when he failed to return home but his body was not discovered until the following morning			2
he was last seen on school cameras at 1:09pm on january 10			0
a few weeks ago , the police handed the family footage from the high school gym			0
but , rather than giving the family the answers they desperately need , they have been left with more questions			0
missed : the death of @entity9 , 17 , was ruled accidental but his parents believe he was killed tragic : he is pictured heading to the gym , left , where he was found dead , right , after he failed to return home @entity29 , a @entity9 family attorney , told @entity30 today that an expert took a close look at the video footage captured by motion - activated cameras and discovered ‘ a very suspicious image ’			1
‘ that evening there is a blurry figure after the hour that the school had closed and you see what is a silhouette of somebody walking in the area of the mat. ’ @entity29 pointed to footage captured from camera ‘ @entity77 ’ in the gym aimed at the wrestling mats was what drew his concern			1
‘ the level of clarity of that image is far , far more pixelated than the same image at approximately 9am on that morning			0
’ while @entity29 stresses his impression of the footage is ‘ preliminary ’ , he believes the varying quality of the image coupled with frequent absent time codes raises more suspicions			1
‘ i do n’t know if it is the result of somebody photoshopping this piece but it lacks time code data , ’ he said			0
‘ in the morning image you have time codes but in the evening images you do n’t			0
’ questions : his family 's attorneys , @entity104 ( left ) and @entity105 ( right ) , pictured on @entity106 said that the footage has been doctored and that key parts are blurry and dark distraught : @entity110 and @entity111 have been calling for justice since their son died in january lt. @entity115 , of the @entity116 , maintains the video was not doctored			1
‘ we have never edited that video			0
we do n’t even have the capabilities to edit the video			0
’ he said the @entity6 footage that was ultimately turned over was stored in a chip			0
‘ the video chip we had was not the total video - it was a chip			0
’ earlier this year they demanded @entity9 ’s body was exhumed			2
a private autopsy was then carried out and found that the @entity9 , who went by the congenial moniker ‘ @entity130 ’ , died by a blow to the neck and also revealed that the boy ’s organs were replaced with newspaper			1
the family also released a gruesome image of @entity9 ’s bloated and apparently beaten face when he was in the mat , fueling their suspicions			2
the controversial case is being reviewed by @entity143 for @entity13 @entity144 who has brought in the @entity145 to determine if @entity9 was killed			2
twist : when his body was exhumed for further investigations , it was found to be missing its organs and stuffed with newspaper instead			1
an independent autopsy found he died of blunt force trauma			1

@entity9 , 17 , was found dead in a rolled - up mat in january and it was **initial*ly* ruled an accident - but his parents believe he was killed
*authorities* have released footage of his final moments at the school
on *thursday* , @entity29 , a @entity9 family attorney , told @entity30 that an expert took a close look at the video footage captured by motion - activated cameras and discovered ‘ a very suspicious image ’
it is yet another twist in the case where an independent autopsy found he died of blunt force trauma and when his body was exhumed for tests , his organs were missing and his body was filled with newspaper
in further *revelations* , a report has *emerged* showing how the *initial* *coroner* *complained* about how investigators dealt with the scene
