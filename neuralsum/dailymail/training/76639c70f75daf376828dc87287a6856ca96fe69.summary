by @entity0 it 's been more than a year since experts announced the remains found in a car park in @entity5 were those of @entity7 - but now experts have raised serious concerns about the findings			1
@entity11 , from @entity12 , and archaeologist @entity13 , from the @entity14 , are challenging the results of the dna testing , and the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating			0
they are even calling for a coroner 's court to be set up to independently review all of the evidence			1
the @entity23 concluded the remains , pictured , belonged to the king during a press conference in february last year			1
experts from @entity12 are now challenging these findings including the results of the dna testing and the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating the remains believed to belong to @entity7 , painting pictured , were uncovered by archaeologists at former church in @entity5 in 2012 the @entity23 concluded the remains belonged to the king during a press conference in february last year , after the body was excavated in september 2012			1
they claimed dna samples matched that of a descendant of the king 's maternal line , while the skeleton 's spinal curvature also matched accounts of the humpback royal			1
the team used radiocarbon dating to determine when the skeleton died , and said this confirmed it was around the same time the king was killed during the @entity52 in 1485			2
speaking to @entity54 , professor @entity11 argued the remains could belong to a victim of any of the battles fought during the @entity58 : ' lots of other people who suffered similar wounds could have been buried in the choir of the church where the bones were found , ' he explained			1
he also queried the project 's use of radiocarbon dating , which dates the bones to the period of @entity7 ’s death : ' such a technique is imprecise			2
it will give you an era , but nothing more			0
' in this case , it covers a period of 80 years			0
' professor @entity11 went on to question the prominence given to dna testing in claims about the identity of the remains , too , adding : ' the dna match could equally be the result of the bones being those of someone descended in the female line from @entity7 ’s mother , @entity89			1
' @entity7 ’s grandmother , @entity90 , for example , had 16 children , ' which made her the ancestor of much of the nobility of the @entity58 - quite a few of whom died violently in those conflicts , ' continued professor @entity11			1
' indeed , it is very hard to prove that the skeleton belongs to a specific person			0
the @entity5 team themselves acknowledge that it ’s extremely rare for archaeologists to find a known individual , let alone a king			1
' the @entity23 concluded the remains belonged to the king during a press conference in february last year after the body was excavated in september 2012			1
the skeleton was described of that of a slender male , in his late 20s or early 30s			0
@entity7 was 32 when he died			0
pictures also revealed a distinctive curvature of the spine synonymous with the hunchback king			2
there was , however , no evidence of a withered arm , which was also part of the @entity7 myth			2
while dna samples matched that of a descendant of the king 's maternal line			1
the team used radiocarbon dating to determine when the skeleton died and said this confirmed it was around the same time the king was killed during the @entity133 in 1485			2
trauma to the skeleton showed the king died after one of two significant wounds to the back of the skull - possibly caused by a sword and a halberd			2
experts said this was consistent with contemporary accounts of the monarch being killed after receiving a blow to the head			2
the skeleton also showed a number of non-fatal injuries to the head and rib and to the pelvis , which is believed to have been caused by a wound through the right buttock			0
the remains were uncovered by archaeologists at former church in @entity5 , which is now a social services car park			1
professor @entity11 argued the remains could belong to a victim of any of the battles fought during the @entity58 , as ' lots of other people who suffered similar wounds could have been buried in the choir of the church			1
' he also queried the project 's use of radiocarbon dating , because it covers a wide period of 80 years			0
professor @entity11 added the dna match could equally match anyone descended in the female line from @entity7 ’s mother , @entity89			1
@entity7 ’s grandmother , @entity90 , for example , had 16 children			2
professor @entity13 continued historians know very little about the graves in the east end of the church and is calling for a coroner 's court , or similar , to review the evidence			1
professor @entity13 echoed these concerns : ' we know very little about the graves in the east end of the church			0
' how many burials were made there in the three centuries of the friary ’s existence , and indeed after the battle of @entity133 ? ' without further excavation there is no certainty			2
before all this goes any further , it would be wise to be certain the body really is his			0
' something akin to a coroner ’s court should be set up to consider all the evidence			1
' two vertebrae of the skeleton , believed to belong to @entity7 , were found to show abnormal features relating to scoliosis , or curvature of the spine			2
@entity23 claimed this find corroborates historical accounts of @entity7 that described him as a hunchback in response to the claims @entity214 , who commissioned and paid for the excavation , said : ' to say it can not be claimed ‘ with any confidence ’ that this is @entity7 is quite puzzling			1
' given the totality of the evidence , it can surely be said with considerable confidence			0
@entity11 says that there may have been ‘ lots of people with similar wounds ’ : perhaps he could name one who fits the bill ? ' @entity7 , depicted by @entity228 as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the @entity231 , died at the @entity133 in 1485 , defeated by an army led by @entity233			0
according to historical records , his body was taken 15 miles to @entity5 where it was displayed as proof of his death , before being buried in the @entity240 friary			1
the team from @entity23 set out to trace the site of the old church and its precincts in 2012 , including the site where @entity7 was finally laid to rest			1
they began excavating the city centre location in august and soon discovered the skeleton , which was found in good condition with its feet missing in a grave around 27 inches ( 68cm ) below ground level			0
it was lying in a rough cut grave with the hands crossed in a manner which indicated they were bound when he was buried			0
to the naked eye , it was clear the remains had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head			0
but archaeologists were keen to make no official announcement until the skeleton had been subjected to months of tests			0
meanwhile , a spokesperson from the @entity23 added : ' the strength of the identification is that different kinds of evidence all point to the same result			1
@entity11 is entitled to his views , but we would challenge and counter them			0
professor @entity11 concluded : ' i ’m not saying that it ’s not @entity7 - it ’s perfectly conceivable that it is - but we are not in a position to say with any confidence that it ’s him			0
' similarly , while the curved spine suggests the skeleton is @entity7 ’s , the presence of scoliosis does not represent conclusive proof			0
' the @entity133 : @entity7 , pictured on the white horse , was killed in battle more than 500 years ago at @entity133 , in a battle which marked the end of his line and the rise of the @entity298			0

the findings have been challenged by history and archaeology experts
they said remains could belong to any victim of @entity58 battles
equally , the @entity311 match could be from any descendant of the king ’s mother
*researchers* are calling for a coroner ’s court to consider all the evidence
meanwhile , @entity23 said its findings all point to the same result and challenges these new claims
remains were uncovered by in a car park in @entity5 in september 2012
