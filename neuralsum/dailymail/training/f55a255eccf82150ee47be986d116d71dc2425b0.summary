by @entity0 published : 19:05 est , 19 january 2013 updated : 19:05 est , 19 january 2013 foreign crimebusters such as @entity3 supercop @entity2 will be given the chance to take over @entity6 police forces under radical new plans to be unveiled by home secretary @entity8			1
and former @entity10 officers will be recruited as police superintendents in an attempt to end the ‘ closed shop ’ police culture blamed for bungled investigations and corruption			1
the changes , set to be fiercely opposed by police chiefs , rip up the centuries - old tradition of only @entity6 citizens serving in the police			1
they also abolish the rule that senior policemen have to work their way up from being a bobby on the beat			0
tough : @entity2 ( pictured left ) cut murders in @entity30 but could n't lead in @entity31 mrs may believes there are too few talented people at the top of the police			0
crucially , she hopes the shake - up will lead to more women and people from ethnic minorities in high command			0
the reforms will have a major effect on policing at three levels : @entity8 believes there are too few talented people at the top of the police mr @entity2 , former head of @entity49 and the @entity50 , was drafted in by @entity51 to advise on tackling gang warfare in @entity6 in 2011			1
the prime minister had suggested putting him in charge of the @entity55 but was forced to drop the plan after protests by @entity6 police chiefs			2
in the end , the job advert said ‘ only @entity6 citizens can apply ’			1
mrs may ’s initiative follows mounting controversy over policing in the @entity6 highlighted by the cover - up in the hillsborough stadium disaster , police conduct in the phone - hacking scandal and the ‘ plebgate ’ row between former minister @entity70 and @entity72 officers			1
her controversial decision to cut constables ’ starting pay by £ 4,000 can now be seen as part of a major overhaul of police recruitment and salaries			2
ministers privately complain that one of the major problems in fighting crime is the ‘ lack of talent ’ in senior policing posts			2
a @entity72 source said : ‘ it will bring a breath of fresh air to policing			0
we ca n’t slam the door in the face of talent just because they have n’t paced the high street as a pc			0
and without these changes , it will take decades to change the all - white and all - male image of the police			0
’ when mr @entity51 first suggested hiring mr @entity2 , he said : ‘ why should n’t someone with a different skill - set be able to join the police force in a senior role ? why should n’t someone who has been a proven success overseas be able to help turn around a force at home ? ’ success : mr @entity2 became known for his ' no - nonsense ' approach to policing when he was in charge of @entity3 's two largest police departments			1
he halved @entity30 's murder rate but sir @entity118 , president of the @entity119 , said : ‘ i am not sure i want to learn about gangs from an area of @entity3 that has 400 of them			2
the notion that you can ship someone in from another country to run a police force in a different environment and a different culture is quite simply stupid			0
’ mr @entity2 , 65 , became renowned for his ‘ no - nonsense ’ approach to policing when he was in charge of @entity3 ’s two largest police departments			1
he halved @entity30 ’s murder rate and cut violent crime by 50 per cent in @entity132 .			0
