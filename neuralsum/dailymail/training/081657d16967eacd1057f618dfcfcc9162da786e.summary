his home is crammed with piles of papers , books , toys on armchairs and clothes and ornaments on every available space			1
but @entity10 is determined to maintain the notion that a man 's home is his castle - and no bureaucrat can take away his possessions			1
the 66 - year - old has recently been served with a council notice to clear his @entity20 home of clutter because of health and safety concerns , but he has refused - claiming their direction breaks the @entity26			1
he was then issued with an ' abatement notice ' which ordered him to remove food waste and thoroughly clean his flat in @entity44 , as well as get rid of all rubbish			2
he told the @entity46 : ' i think i have complied with most of that			0
' it just seems unnecessary , a waste of public money			0
' i ca n't see that i am a threat to public health			0
there 's no vermin here			0
' mr @entity10 has accused the council of breaching article 39 of the @entity26 , drawn up in 1215			1
rooms in mr @entity10 's flat are crammed full of his possessions , with piles of books and paper seen on sofas and chairs as well as on the floor every surface is covered with items mr @entity10 has collected , with clothes and trinkets strewn on a bed and flags and banners on the walls the pensioner has vast piles of photographs and letters which litter the floor , shelves and tables of his home but wants to keep them all mr @entity10 has bizarre collections including books , papers and leaflets ( left ) but insists he has cleaned up as directed by the council ( right ) this states that : ' @entity91 shall be taken or imprisoned , or be disseised of his @entity92 , or @entity93 , or free customs , or be outlawed , or exiled , or any other wise destroyed ; nor will we not pass upon him , nor condemn him , but by lawful judgment of his peers , or by the @entity98			1
we will sell to no man , we will not deny or defer to any man either justice or @entity101			0
' ' disseised ' means ' removed ' and mr @entity10 claims this covers the possessions in his home , and said there had been no legal hearing of his case and his rights are therefore being breached			1
the rooms of his flat are packed with items , with clocks on chairs and banners and number plates on the walls			2
in the kitchen dozens of pots , pans and plates are stacked around the sink , with no space on any surface			2
the pensioner disputes claims his home and vast array of hoarded items could be a health and safety hazard and said it is hygienic and safe mr @entity10 lives in a flat in @entity20 where he has filled rooms fit to bursting with items he has collected including books and papers books , papers , bags and signs abound throughout the home and were seen by @entity140 officers who were ' not pleased ' with it some rooms are covered with clothes and dressing up items ( left ) while the kitchen ( right ) is stacked high with pots , pans and plates under normal council rules householders are given a set period of time to clear up their property until police may be called to enforce it @entity36 said an abatement notice may be issued by @entity156 when they are concerned about the hygiene and cleanliness of a property			1
a spokesman said : ' the council may give the householder a period of time with a deadline , in which to clean their house			0
' if the householder fails to improve in the period of time given by the court , the council will take further action and in some instances , involve the police where necessary			0
' previously researchers from the @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity178 , found that people with hoarding disorder have abnormal activity in regions of their brains which affect decision making and can lead them to choose not to throw items away .			0

@entity10 has crammed his @entity20 home with dozens of papers toys and photographs he has collected
the hoarder has covered every available surface in his flat with the items and piles litter the floors and tables
the 66 - year - old was visited at his flat by @entity156 after concerns were raised about property
officers issued him with a notice to clear up his home and remove all the rubbish stored because of safety fears
but mr @entity10 claims the council order breaches article of the ancient @entity26 , which was produced in 1215
he said article *stipulates* a man should not have his possessions removed with a legal judgement taking place
