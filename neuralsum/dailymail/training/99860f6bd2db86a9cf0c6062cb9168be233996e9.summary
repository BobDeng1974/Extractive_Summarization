a furious brown bear is believed to have staged this stunning revenge attack on the car of a hunter who shot and wounded it in the leg			1
the unnamed huntsman and two friends were in the @entity12 forest when the beast surprised them			1
' the animal ran amok : it scratched the @entity26 's body , broke the lights , smashed the windscreen , tore the front and rear seats , and ripped off the rear bumper , ' reported @entity52			0
' the owner shook his head in disbelief			0
' the most surprising fact about the onslaught was that the vehicles belonging to the hunter 's friends were completely untouched			0
baffling : the men concluded that the bear has used his acute sense of smell to locate the car of the man who had left him crippled , and wreaked his vengeance			1
but it left the hunter 's friends ' cars completely untouched big squeeze : the beast apparently even managed to get inside the car in the attack ' that must have been a busy night for the bear , he worked hard , ' said the hunter 's astonished friend			1
' you must have had something sweet inside the car			0
' shocked , the hunter replies : ' no , i did n't			0
' the men concluded that the bear has used his acute sense of smell to locate the car of the man who had left him crippled , and wreaked his vengeance			1
nor was there any doubt that the attack was by a bear			2
claw marks and footprints were visible in the wet clay at the scene , as if the creature had left his calling card			1
' that must have been a busy night for the bear , he worked hard , ' said the hunter 's astonished friend			2

@entity12 bears tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer , more persecuted @entity128 counterparts			2
@entity12 bears regularly destroy hunters â€™ storages and huts where they think there is food			2
they are also more carnivorous than those in @entity128 too , hunting mountain hares , reindeer , wapiti or moose by ambushing them from pine trees			0
they do not , however , seem to like honey .			0

the astonishing revenge attack apparently took place in a forest in @entity12
