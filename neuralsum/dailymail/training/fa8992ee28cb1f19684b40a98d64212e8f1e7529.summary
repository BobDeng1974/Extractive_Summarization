by @entity0 last updated at 4:33 pm on 9th september 2011 relief : @entity2 at her appeal court hearing in @entity4 jailed @entity2 today spoke of her relief that ' finally they believe me ' as her hopes rose she will be cleared of the murder of @entity10			1
@entity11 , 24 , is serving 26 years for the brutal killing of the 21 - year - old @entity14 student , who was found semi naked and her throat slashed in her bedroom of the house they shared with two other women			2
also convicted with her was her former boyfriend @entity22 , 27 , who was given 25 years			0
both deny any involvement and have based their appeal on shaky forensic evidence that was used to jail them in their first trial but has now proved shockingly unreliable			1
their hopes have been raised after two court appointed independent experts produced a report which condemned the original forensic investigation as shoddy with clear breaches of internationally recognised guidelines being breached raising the possibility of contamination			1
earlier this week prosecutors - who admitted they are not confident the convictions will be upheld - had a request for a second review of the evidence denied by judge @entity46			2
turning down the plea , he said it was ' superfluous ' and that he and the jury had heard enough , while her family insisted it proved the case against her was ' falling apart			1
' guarded : @entity11 is held by an armed female officer as she arrives at her appeal hearing in @entity4 court drama : @entity11 consults her lawyer at the appeal hearing surrounded by armed police officers in an interview with local newspaper @entity63 through her lawyer @entity64 , @entity61 @entity11 said : ' finally they believe me			1
i always knew that i would make it			0
i hope that i will be back home in the @entity61 for @entity70			1
it 's great to know that at last they do n't hate me any more , that they are not looking at me as if i am guilty , although not all of them believe me			0
victim : @entity10 was found with her throat slashed ' some still want to hurt me and i do n't understand why			1
' during the first trial i was so afraid to go in the witness box , there was such a hostile atmosphere			0
every time i spoke and cried as i tried to explain that i had nothing to do with what happened that night , ' i could tell people were laughing bemusedly and shrugging their shoulders			0
now it 's all changed			0
' when asked what her biggest secret was @entity11 replied : ' i 'm going to whisper it because i still do n't believe it , because i 'm still scared it could all change at the last minute , that they could still find me guilty			0
' ok i will tell you			0
my secret is that i always believed i would get out of jail , where my life had frozen , after getting the truth to emerge			0
' @entity11 , from @entity101 , refused to comment on a film made about her earlier this year which starred @entity104 and said : ' i do n't want to talk about that , that 's all part of the hatred that i am trying to beat			0
' @entity10 was my friend , i liked her , i could never hurt her			1
' today her father @entity11 visited his daughter in @entity111 prison			0
earlier this week he said that he was in @entity4 , where the murder took place in november 2007 , to ' take @entity2 home ' adding that the case was '' falling apart at the seams			1
' the hearing is due to resume with closing arguments and final speeches on september 23rd and a final verdict is expected a week later			0
jail visit : @entity11 , pictured with @entity2 's stepfather @entity122 , saw his daughter in @entity111 prison rumours are already flying around @entity4 that @entity61 tv networks are offering her a ' million dollar deal ' to secure an exclusive interview with her if and when she is released			1
however her friend @entity128 , who moved to @entity4 to be close to her , said : ' she has n't decided anything yet			2
convicted killer : @entity22 at his appeal ' if she gets out she just wants to go home and spend time with her friends and family			0
she wants to get her life back			0
' under @entity139 law @entity11 could launch a compensation claim against the judicial system if she is cleared and could be awarded 500,000 euros in damages for the four years she has spent in jail			2
key to the case is a 30cm kitchen knife found at @entity22 's apartment on which dna from @entity11 was on the handle and that of @entity10 , was discovered on the blade			1
however the independent report by @entity153 and @entity154 of @entity156 's @entity155 has questioned seriously the reliability of the findings by forensic scientists			2
although they do not doubt @entity11 's @entity149 is on the handle , they have questioned the findings related to @entity10 insisting that the level is so low it should not have been admitted as evidence in the first trial			1
the experts have also questioned the reliability of dna evidence found on @entity10 's bloodied bra clasp which was found at the scene and then ' missed ' for six weeks			1
the original trial heard there were traces of @entity22 on the clasp after it was examined by forensic scientists but the experts say the fact it was left for six weeks at the scene leaves it open to contamination			2
police forensic scientist @entity180 who led the original investigation has dismissed any suggestion of contamination and insisted she and her team followed strict guidelines			1
but the appeal the court was shown a video which filmed the forensic team collecting evidence with dirty gloves and using their hands instead of tweezers to collect items			2
@entity10 , from @entity195 , @entity196 , was in @entity4 as part of her @entity198 and had only been in @entity139 for two months before she was brutally murdered			1
@entity11 and @entity22 were jailed in december 2009			0
a third defendant , small - time drug dealer @entity10 , an immigrant from the @entity201 , was also jailed in connection with the brutal killing			2
he was handed a 30 - year sentence for murder and sexual violence following a fast - track trial in october 2008 which was later cut to 16 years .			0

@entity61 student confident she will cleared of the murder of @entity212 @entity10
case ' falling apart at the seams ' because of shoddy and unreliable forensic investigation
