but this talented artist has put his digits to even more impressive use by turning them into lifelike recreations of famous faces			2
the inventive @entity9 , from @entity10 , has produced versions of everyone from @entity13 and @entity14 to @entity15 and @entity16			1
who would you give the finger ? the 33 - year - old artist has transformed his digits into characters as varied as @entity14 , left , and @entity16 , right @entity22 job : @entity24 has made his fingers look like recognisable faces from the @entity13 , left , to @entity27 , right he works under the pseudonym @entity24 , in reference to the burlesque dancer @entity30 and because ' il dito ' means ' the finger '			1
the ' @entity33 ' project aims to look at our sense of identity and how we use disguises - particularly when we leave a ' digital fingerprint ' online			2
it all started three years ago , when @entity24 , 33 , was looking for an original avatar to use as his profile picture on @entity42			1
@entity24 said he chose a finger as a disguise because he was not keen to reveal his identity			1
he said : ' in @entity9 someone could say i wanted to " hide myself behind my finger [ trans : nascondermi dietro un dito ] " - it 's a metaphor to indicate a not - very - effective hiding place			0
odd extremity : fictional characters such as @entity55 , left , and @entity57 's @entity56 , right , are at the tip of the artist 's fingers it 's a funny fing : these pictures brilliantly capture the spirit of @entity65 's @entity64 , left , and @entity66 's @entity66 , right ' i used this metaphor to say we all try to hide ourselves behind an image of us we create			2
that 's my finger , the changing masks everybody wears in playing life ... especially famous people			0
' the characters are chosen from daily news and important happenings , historical events , arts , music , television and politics			0
@entity24 changes the skin colour and adds hairstyles , distinctive features and even make up			0
other recognisable faces that @entity24 has digitally altered include @entity89 star @entity88 , to whom he added black and white facepaint , a wild hairstyle and even a pink tongue			1
digitally altered : the @entity9 's versions of @entity94 , left , and @entity15 , right , force us to confront our vivid perception of these faces handymen : images of @entity100 , left , and grease 's @entity101 , right , also appear in the diverse collection of faces from fiction , current affairs and the arts his @entity108 wears a green hat and smokes a pipe , while his version of @entity113 founder @entity27 sports glasses and bushy grey eyebrows			1
@entity24 has even put his finger on the perfect look for fictional characters @entity56 from @entity57 , @entity65 's @entity64 and animated monster @entity55			0
he has tackled all the @entity120 character as well as @entity121 's @entity101 in @entity122			0
the @entity33 project also taps into the importance of the index finger in today 's digital world - where many of us use our index finger to operate touchscreens			0
so if you want to examine your own ' digital identity ' , perhaps it is time to turn back to finger painting			2
finger paintings : @entity24 has also portrayed @entity120 characters including mr @entity136 , left , as well as famous detective @entity108 , right			1

funny ' finger paintings ' recreate @entity14 , @entity16 and the @entity13
the digitally altered digits were designed to examine *questions* of identity and disguise
it all started with a @entity42 avatar - and one of the faces is @entity66 , from the film of that name
