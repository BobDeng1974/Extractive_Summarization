three quarters of samples taken from one popular website were found to contain harmful levels of bacteria			1
several babies have already been made ill by drinking contaminated milk , according to the study by the @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			1
while human milk is also provided through milk banks to hospitals , their donors are carefully screened and all the milk is pasturised to remove harmful germs			1
@entity31 , the lead author and a researcher said that with internet sites , ' you have very few ways to know for sure what you are getting is really breast milk and that it 's safe to feed your baby			1
' ' because the consequences can be serious , it is not a good idea to obtain breast milk in this way			2
' the study tested 101 samples from one popular site , which they did n't name			1
seventy - four percent of the samples either had disease - causing bacteria like @entity51 or harmful levels of bacteria such as @entity54			1
as a control 20 samples from a milk bank were tested , and seven tested positive for containing disease - causing bacteria			1
dr. @entity60 , pediatrics chief at @entity61 in @entity62 , who was not involved in the study , called the results ' pretty scary ' adding : ' just imagine if the donor happens to be a drug user			0
' the study does not say where the bacteria comes from , but possible sources include donors ' skin , breast pumps used to extract milk , or contamination from improper shipping methods			2
while researchers admit that all milk will contain some bacteria which is essential for building up babies ' immune systems , these were not the bacteria they looked at			0

' ' we will be shifting our focus from mother to mother internet sales to helping qualified only the breast donors provide milk to a new milk banking program			0
' the company says it will screen its donors and process their milk in partnership with @entity130			0
supporters of milk - sharing also say that a line needs to be drawn between donors , who give away their milk for free and have nothing to gain from lying about their health , and sellers			0
@entity140 of @entity141 , @entity142 , is a donor who found a local woman who needed breast milk through one of the online sites where milk is offered free			1
' a lot of people are like , " ewww , it 's weird , " but they have n't been in a situation where they did n't want their child to have formula , ' or could n't produce enough milk , @entity150 said			0
she said she shared her medical history with the recipient			0
@entity150 is breast - feeding her 7 - month - old and stores excess milk in her freezer			0
