after hundreds of battered @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 rolled off the stricken cargo ship the sole £ 260,000 @entity5 on board emerged without a scratch			1
the @entity7 was bound for @entity8 in @entity9 with 1,400 luxury cars on january 3 , when it was deliberately grounded on @entity12 in the @entity13 to stop it capsizing			1
its cargo arrived back into @entity17 with ' limited damage ' , but the ship owners says it is unable to confirm the future of the vehicles after fears were raised that the entire fleet would need to be scrapped			1
and surprisingly , among the dented doors and scratched paintwork sat a single @entity25 , destined for private owners believed to be in the @entity54 - the final destination for the ship , which arrived in pristine condition			1
the incident happened after an excavator on one of the decks had shifted , punching a hole in the hull and causing 3,000 tonnes of water to flood some of the car decks - leaving a some of the vehicles under water			1
the ship , which has 12 decks , was just a third full when it left the @entity71 coast and was expected to pick up more cargo when it arrived at the @entity9 port , before heading to its final destination in the @entity54			1
the @entity7 was bound for @entity8 in @entity9 with 1,400 luxury cars on january 3 rescued : a @entity1 covered in plastic is taken off the @entity7 by a fork lift truck , after the ship ran aground 45 minutes off the coast damaged : another plastic - covered @entity1 is driven off the @entity36 - registered vehicle into @entity83 's @entity82 where it waits for assessment ruined : a loader transports other seriously damaged vehicles - some of which had been submerged in water - off the ill - fated vessel a spokesman for the ship owners said the @entity93 had come from @entity94 to the @entity95 and that ' the majority of the cargo was headed for the @entity98 and @entity54 ' where it was likely to go on to a range of dealers and some private owners			1
he said : ' these ships are used for transporting very big equipment and we are chartered with transporting the cargo			0
@entity107 has no right to decide on the future of the cargo			0
' we need our ship back so that we can fix it and that ; s going to happen in @entity83			2
we are going through the process of removing the cargo , which needs to go and be reviewed and engineers are looking at a variety of cars and equipment which has already been offloaded			0
' it presents a logistical issue for the owners of the cars about what to do next			2
' he added that the discharge operation is expected to continue into next week			0
concerns over the fleets future were raised after a similar accident in 2006 wrecked 4,700 mazdas			0
the cars were sent to the crusher after transporter @entity132 partially capsized in the @entity134 while carrying the cars away from the factory			0
battered : a @entity47 with a dented door is driver from the ship			2
it is one of 65 minis that were on board at the time the ship started to list wrecked : the ship 's owners said there was ' limited damage ' to most of the 1,400 luxury vehicles , however , plenty rolled off with doors missing it was left resting for just over three weeks - a similar length of time to the @entity26 - at an angle of 60 degrees			1
initially a @entity155 spokesman said that only 68 cars had been damaged in the crash , either by slipping their moorings or rolling into other vehicles , but it was eventually decided that all 4,700 vehicles needed to be crushed			2
engineers were worried about what effect resting at such a severe angle for so long would have on the inner workings of the cars , especially on the electrolyte in the batteries			0
rather than open themselves up to the possibility of lawsuits due to mechanical faults , the company decided that it was safer to scrap the lot			0
untouched : among the dented @entity2 and @entity176 emerged a perfectly preserved armoured personnel carrier ( pictured ) @entity178 : the massive tank was among hundreds of heavy equipment on board including 105 pieces of construction equipment the @entity93 was deliberately run aground after it started to list at 52 degrees , a similar angle to the @entity132 , just after leaving @entity83 port			1
if it is decided that all the vehicles need to be disposed of then the total bill will run into the tens of millions of pounds			0
high winds and heavy rain hampered the rescue operation - even causing one of the tugs to smash into the @entity93 as it was being towed			0
it is not yet known which vehicles were damaged by the sea water inside the ship and the spokesman said the vehicles were owned by ' a variety of parties ' - including dealers and private owners			1
cars which are damaged or do not start up will be towed off the ship			2
the 25 person crew had to be rescued by @entity206 and a coastguard helicopter with two people suffering non-life threatening injuries during the incident			0
the cargo ship , which is 180 metres long and 32 metres wide , finally arrived back in @entity83 on january 22			1
a spokeswoman from the @entity214 ( @entity214 ) confirmed they were investigating what had caused the large vessel to list so dramatically			0
january 3 , 8.30pm - @entity218 , a @entity36 - registered ship , left the port of @entity83 bound for @entity8 in @entity221 180 metre long ship was bound for @entity9 , and loaded with 1,400 cars including @entity45 , @entity2 and a £ 260,000 @entity5			1
january 3 , 9.20pm - about 45 minutes after it left the port the 15 year old ship started to list badly at 52 degrees			1
it was deliberately grounded by the crew , near the @entity229 in @entity40 , to prevent it capsizing			0
a rescue operation was then launched to rescue the captain and 25 crew members			0
it is understood the cargo ship , which has a nine - metre draught , turned sharply to the left as it passed the notorious @entity237 near @entity238 and ran aground			2
following the incident a 200 metre exclusion zone was set up around the ship , to prevent other vessels interfering with the tugs			0
january 5 - salvage experts unsuccessfully tried to re-float the huge ship by using four tugs to pull it off the sandbank			2
the @entity7 was deliberately grounded in the @entity13 , around 20 minutes into its journey , after it started listing at 52 degrees january 7 - the ship was floated from @entity12 on the high tide and tugs were used to tow it to @entity256 near @entity257			1
january 10 - one of the tugs crashed into the ship during a period of high @entity261 excavator that was on board shifted during the sailing and punched a hole in the side of the hull , which was quickly repaired			1
but some 3,000 tonnes of water entered the vessel			0
january 17 - the 3,000 tonnes of water was pumped out and into empty fuel tanks on board			2
january 22 - salvage firm @entity272 was able to complete ballast management and reduce the ship 's list to five degrees			1
it was then towed to @entity17 by four tugs.during its journey , an exclusion zone around the vessel was in place , set at 1,000 metres ahead and behind and 100 metres either side			0
airspace was also restricted to one mile around the route as a precaution			0
hundreds of people gathered at @entity288 to watch the ship complete its three hour journey back to the port			2
january 27 - luxury cars , including @entity1 and a @entity176 , started to be driven off the ship .			1

the @entity7 was bound for @entity9 with 1,400 luxury cars on board when it started list at 45 degrees
@entity299 arrived back with ' limited damage ' but ship owners can not confirm its future amid fears it could be scrapped
among dented and scratched vehicles sat privately - owned @entity5 - which survived completely unscathed
