by @entity0 forget the races , for many @entity2 is all about the fashion			1
that 's why @entity5 have hired style guru @entity6 to be their fashion correspondent as the glamorous event begins today			1
clothes expert @entity6 will be on hand every day to comment on ' who 's who ' while appraising racegoers ' outfits			2
@entity6 's fashion picks : he recommends , clockwise from left , colour - blocking with this vivid yellow number , eccentric prints , modern but still demure and chic lace and a dress and jacket combination for those who want to keep covered up attendees must adhere to traditional style rules including wearing skirts and dresses of a ' modest length ' , dress straps of one inch or greater ( no strapless dresses allowed ) and hats instead of fascinators			1
@entity6 said fashionistas can stick to the guidelines while still keeping their look on - trend			2
he said : ' my career is based on challenging tradition , but it 's all about taking classic stuff and twisting that			2
when you see women on @entity42 and they 're all parading along with their avant - garde hats and the latest trends , it 's all full of tradition			1
' the hemlines are to the knee , the arms are covered , there are all these rules and regulations			2
at the same time , there are little moments of new trends			2
' style watch : @entity6 will be the fashion correspondent for @entity5 at @entity2 this year , his pick of the trends are florals , monochrome and lace			1
he said : ' modern florals ooze femininity			2
if you 're an hourglass , look for a dress that has a deep v - neck and synched - in waist to make the most of those gorgeous , @entity63 curves			0
' he added : ' for an effortlessly glamorous , classic @entity72 look , pick monochrome			0
if you 're slim , a figure - hugging dress which finishes on or just below the knee will knock ' em dead			0
' jackets and pashminas are allowed in the @entity81 enclosure and @entity6 says they are a good option ' if you 're worried about putting too much on show – or the @entity86 weather			0
' @entity2 's official style guide stipulates no strapless dresses or fascinators for women and morning suits for men in the royal enclosure			1
@entity6 said you can stick to the rules whilst adding a personal twist he also believes lace will continue to be a big trend at this year 's event			1
he said : ' if the thought of lace makes you think of your gran 's net curtains , think again			0
there are loads of gorgeous , modern laces out there which look effortlessly chic			0
and a mesh or sheer material on the sleeves gives a beautiful hint of flesh whilst also giving you some coverage			0
' when it comes to footwear , he said nude heels , like those favoured by the @entity118 , are always a winner			0
be bold : @entity6 recommends clashing patterns and bold prints like these seen in the official @entity2 style guide on trend : @entity6 said floral prints like this will be another winner ' a heel will make your legs look gorgeous and a pointy toe will make your pins look even longer			1
every woman should own a pair of black or nude heels – they 'll go with everything , ' he recommends			0
but @entity6 's style tips are n't just for women			1
while he said men are more restricted in the @entity142 on how adventurous they can be with their outfit , there are ways to make a morning suit reflect personal taste			0
ahead of the trends : at last year 's @entity2 , the @entity148 showcased two of the looks @entity6 recommends will be big this year - colour - blocking , left , and floral print , right never out of fashion : @entity6 said nude heels , like those seen on the @entity118 when she went to @entity153 at @entity154 with princes @entity155 and @entity156 in 2011 , are a wise choice he said : the only things you can use to express yourself are your shirt - and - tie combination , and then your cufflinks			1
and then it 's more hidden moments - the lining of your waistcoat or your jacket – it 's all about hidden personality			2
' the tv presenter said wearing a morning suit to front the @entity2 fashion coverage will be an unusual experience for him			1
take a chance : of course you can get it wrong , but with clashing patterns , bright colours and bold prints a-plenty , chances are you will probably nail it			0
so be daring and give it a go , you mightjust surprise yourself ! get your underwear right : get your foundations right and everything else should fall into place			0
get the support you need in all the right places because that 's the last thing you want to worry about on the day ! size matters : the fit of your clothing has to be right			0
if you are literally tied up like a turkey ready for basting , you 're going to be uncomfortable			0
be on trend : there 's going to be a lot of monochrome and quite a lot of colour clash			1
floral prints are a huge trend throughout the whole of the summer as well			1
it 's going to feel very beautiful @entity208 garden			0
of course , there will be the big - brimmed hats as well and this season we 've gone very clean and neat with our tailoring , and we 've put that on to prints as well			1
so expect to seeloads and loads of sharp lines			0
