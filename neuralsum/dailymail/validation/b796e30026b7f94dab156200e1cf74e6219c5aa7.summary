he is better known as the hapless , doughnut - obsessed safety officer at @entity4 nuclear power plant , but it appears that @entity6 may have outwitted some of the brightest minds on the planet			1
the author of a book looking at the maths hidden within episodes of the @entity14 has discovered that @entity6 may have predicted the mass of the @entity16 boson 14 years before physicists discovered the particle at the @entity19 in @entity20			1
dr @entity21 , a physicist and author , found the solution written on a blackboard in front of @entity6 during a 1998 episode of the long running cartoon			1
speaking to the @entity39 , dr @entity21 said : ' that equation predicts the mass of the @entity32			1
the ' @entity32 ' , also known as the @entity32 , was a missing piece in the jigsaw for physicists in trying to understand how the universe works			0
scientists believe that a fraction of a second after the @entity48 that gave birth to the universe , an invisible energy field , called the @entity32 , formed			2
this has been described as a kind of ' cosmic treacle ' across the universe			0
as particles passed through it , they picked up mass , giving them size and shape and allowing them to form the atoms that make up you , everything around you and everything in the universe			0
this was the theory proposed in 1964 by former grammar school boy @entity16 that has now been confirmed			0
without the @entity16 field particles would simply whizz around space in the same way as light does			0
a boson is a type of sub-atomic particle			0
every energy field has a specific particle that governs its interaction with what 's around it			0
to try to pin it down , scientists at the @entity19 near @entity82 smashed together beams of protons – the ' hearts of atoms ' – at close to the speed of light , recreating conditions that existed a fraction of a second after the @entity48			2
although they would rapidly decay , they should have left a recognisable footprint			0
this footprint was found in 2012			0
' if you work it out you get the mass of a @entity16 boson that 's only a bit larger than the nano - mass of a @entity32 actually is			1
' it 's kind of amazing as @entity6 makes this prediction 14 years before it was discovered			1
' he added : ' one of the equations relates to @entity103 , and my first book was about all about this notorious equations , so leapt out of the screen			0
' my phd is in particle physics , so i was similarly shocked by @entity6 's equation predicting the mass of the @entity32			1
' the existence of the @entity32 - sometimes nicknamed the @entity32 - was first predicted by professor @entity113 , a theoretical physicist at the @entity115 , and five other physicists in 1964			1
the elementary particle is required to explain why other fundamental particles in the universe have mass. the theory said that all subatomic particles interact within an energy field known as the @entity16 field , giving them mass. like electromagnetic radiation , which can exist as both an energetic wave and a particle simultaneously , the @entity128 's field also has a corresponding particle - the @entity32			2
proof that the particle existed , however , did not appear until march 2013 when scientists working on the @entity19 - the worlds biggest atom smasher - announced they had discovered a particle that matched predictions of the @entity32 would be like			1
in an experiment costing £ 8.6 billion ( $ 13.25 billion ) , they were able to prove the existence of a new particle with a mass of @entity144			0
the physicists at @entity20 who worked on the discovery , along with @entity16 and his colleagues were awarded a @entity148 for their contribution			0
however , it appears that the writers of the @entity14 had already successfully predicted the outcome 14 years earlier			1
dr @entity21 claims the formula written by @entity6 while he is attempting to come up with a series of madcap inventions , including an electric hammer and make - up gun , gives close to the same answer			1
the @entity14 contains many mathematical jokes like the one above from an early episode in the series this equation above is said to concern the density of the universe but after a minor implosion in his basement @entity6 adjust the equation in an attempt to adjust the balance and prevent further accidents @entity21 has written a book on the maths hidden within the cartoon series @entity14 in fact one of the script writers for the episode , @entity177 , was responsible for sneaking in the mathematical equations onto the blackboard			1
he contacted one of his high school friends , @entity181 , who is an astronomer at @entity183			0
the first equation on the blackboard was largely based on his work predicting the mass of the @entity16 boson - denoted by @entity32			1
the pair cooked up the equation to give the best answer on the data available at the time			0
dr @entity21 said : ' the equation is a playful combination of various fundamental parameters , namely the @entity197 constant , the gravitational constant , and the speed of light			1
' if you look up these numbers and plug them into the equation , it predicts a mass of 775 giga - electron - volts ( @entity206 ) , which is not unreasonably higher than the 125 gev estimate that emerged when the @entity32 was discovered in 2012			2
' indeed , 775 @entity206 was not a bad guess bearing in mind that @entity6 is an amateur inventor and he performed this calculation fourteen years before the physicists at @entity20 , the @entity20 , tracked down the elusive particle			2
' it is not the only piece of science hidden within the long running cartoon series			0
the second line on the blackboard contains an equation that some have claimed is the solution to @entity103 's last theorem - although in truth the calculation falls just short			1
perhaps typically @entity6 also appears to have been thinking with his stomach with a formula that suggests eating half a doughnut makes a whole			1
or is it just a hole ? elsewhere in the series there are numerous jokes about perfect numbers and mersenne primes and the first ever full episode had a joke about calculus			2
dr @entity21 , who has written a book called @entity14 and their mathematical secrets , claims that the @entity14 is the most mathematical tv shows on prime time television			1
this may be because many of the writers of the show were mathematicians themselves			2
mr @entity177 , who wrote scripts for the @entity14 for five years , was a gifted mathematician from a young age and studied physics at @entity251			0
he is known to often smuggle mathematics into the tv series			0
dr @entity21 said he hoped the maths in the cartoon might even help persuade more people to take an interest in the subject			1
he said : ' @entity14 has many mathematicians on its writing team , including @entity262 , who worked on the very first series and who pretty much runs the show today			2
' he was such a brilliant young mathematician that he went to @entity251 when he was only sixteen years old			0
' if a nerdy teenager spots the maths in @entity14 , i hope that he or she will think that maths is rightly cool			2
' @entity14 is cool , the writers of @entity14 are cool , and if they like maths then maths must be cool			2
i think the show gives a big endorsement of nerd culture			0

author and physicist dr @entity21 found a formula for the mass of the @entity32 written on a blackboard during an episode of @entity14
in @entity33 , @entity6 becomes an inventor
dr @entity21 says @entity14 contains more maths than any other tv show
he says it is amazing that @entity6 appears to have predicted the mass of the @entity32 long before the @entity19 gave us proof it existed
jokes about calculus , pi and @entity103 's last theorem appear in the cartoon
many of the script writers for the cartoon are known to be mathematicians
