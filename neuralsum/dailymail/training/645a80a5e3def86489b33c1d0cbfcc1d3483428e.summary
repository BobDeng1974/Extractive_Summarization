by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 20:25 est , 17 december 2012 updated : 04:24 est , 19 december 2012 bargain hunters looking for @entity4 presents have been stripping shelves bare at doomed comet stores today - the @entity8 giant 's last day of in - store trading			1
shoppers queued outside one of the stricken retailer 's shops in @entity14 waiting for doors to open this morning as the company called time on 79 years of sales			1
shelves were left empty this afternoon as the store offered discounts on remaining stock and dejected workers were seen dismantling display units and taking down sale posters			1
the final store closures come after @entity26 became the latest big name casualty of the recession , slipping into administration last month			2
the circumstances surrounding the company 's demise will now be investigated by the @entity68 's investigations department it was announced today			1
following its collapse , @entity26 ’s accounts show it has insufficient funds to cover redundancy payments to its 6,600 staff with the government now responsible for paying staff their last pay cheque			1
and a further £ 26.1million is lost in tax to @entity79 , which is an unsecured creditor and receives nothing			1
the government is therefore nursing a combined £ 49.1million loss			2
the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the company are to be examined by the investigation 's branch of the @entity68 which will cover the run - up to administration and @entity26 ’s takeover by a private equity - backed investment vehicle in february			1
empty : everything has already gone from the @entity26 store desolate : a worker wheels electrical goods across an empty shop floor at a comet store in @entity14 liquidation : a shopper eyes up a late @entity4 present at @entity26 in @entity14 it is understood that the investigation is a matter of course and will check that the processes behind the firm 's fall into administration was handled correctly			1
a spokesman for the @entity112 , said today : ' we can confirm that the @entity68 has launched a fact finding inquiry under section 447 of the @entity117 into @entity118 ' the purpose of the inquiry is to investigate the circumstances surrounding its insolvency and to establish whether further action is required			1
' we are not in a position to comment further at this stage			0
to do so could prejudice the outcome of the investigation and any future action			0
final preparations : workings at the @entity52 branch take down sale posters bare : the shelves in @entity38 this afternoon mess : products lie strewn on the shelves at @entity26 in @entity38 as customers search for bargains ' @entity138 is already reviewing the overall insolvency regulatory framework , to see whether it remains fit for purpose in today ’s environment			2
' the government 's £ 50million loss on behalf of @entity26 comes despite the fact that there still assets worth almost the same amount in the business , but under the terms of the administration they belong to @entity151 , the controversial private equity firm run by founder @entity153			1
the multi-millionaire @entity155 , who is married to @entity159 - born pop singer @entity158 , managed to put his firm at the front of the queue of creditors after taking over the chain of 240 stores eleven months ago			1
drowning sorrows : this sign was taped in the window of a branch of the electrical retailer comet in @entity171 today this is a legal practice used by investment firms to ensure they lose as little cash as possible when they buy troubled businesses and the rescue fails			2
the firm received a £ 50 million dowry from @entity181 as part of the acquisition of the chain and continues to own @entity26 ’s warranties business , which is not in administration			2
the vehicle was also repaid a £ 9.5 million loan prior to the collapse			2
meanwhile , the thousands of ordinary customers who still own £ 4.7million - worth of unused gift cards and vouchers remain on the list of unsecured creditors			2
those who paid by credit or debit card will be protected by their card companies , but the rest will get little or nothing back			0
city sources say it is unclear whether @entity151 will make a net profit from the debacle			0
while @entity62 shows the company technically lost £ 95.7m with revenues slumping by £ 200million in the year to april , it is impossible to work out how much of this comes out of @entity151 ’s own pockets			0
it emerged that the company lost a further £ 31 million in the subsequent five months as credit insurers lost confidence and withdrew support for the business			0
much of the £ 145.4million owed by @entity26 when it went into administration will fall at the door of its banks and investors			0
the closure of the final group of 49 stores from the former 236 - strong estate comes seven weeks after @entity62 was appointed as administrator			0
closed : the shutters are coming down on the @entity229 's last remaining comet stores today			1
this one in @entity230 has already closed for the first time best buys : the last few items of stock have been brought to the front of the doomed store in @entity237 , @entity238 fire sale : this comet store in @entity241 , @entity242 , slashed prices of its remaining stock by up to 60 per cent off farewell : a shopper in @entity246 looks pleased with himself as he leaves the @entity240 on the last day of trading the collapse of the firm , which was founded in @entity250 in 1933 and employed 6,895 people , marks one of the biggest high street casualties since the demise of @entity255 in 2008			1
@entity62 has failed to find a buyer for the company or any of its shops			0
@entity26 was hit by weak high street trading conditions and fierce competition from online rivals			0
its suppliers could not find insurers willing to cover goods delivered should @entity26 default on its bills			0
the environment for credit insurance became tough and was withdrawn forcing @entity151 to pay for all its stock upfront			0
as the crucial @entity4 period approached stock levels peaked , making it impossible for the firm to find the necessary cash to buy stock			0
in particular , it was knocked by the lack of first - time home - buyers , who had been key customers for @entity26			0
bargain hunter : a shopper leaves a @entity26 store with discounted items in @entity241 , southern @entity285 bargain hunters : customers have headed to comet stores across the country today hoping to bag a bargain as the chain holds a last minute fire sale before closing			1
