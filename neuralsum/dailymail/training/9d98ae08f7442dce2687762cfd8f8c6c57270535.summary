by @entity0 it 's one of the most colorful weekends on the calendar with @entity5 events taking place around the world , but less than 45 years ago there were few celebrations of the @entity11 community at all			1
there were no openly gay politicians			2
no tv show had any identifiably gay characters			2
it was legal to fire gay men or women , and deny them housing			0
when @entity21 made a film with a major homosexual character , the character was either killed or killed himself			0
there were no openly gay policemen , public school teachers , doctors , or lawyers			0
in 1970 , to mark the first anniversary of the @entity32 uprisings , the very first gay pride marches took place in @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , and @entity37			1
and progress is still being made			0
this week the @entity40 @entity39 dumped the @entity41 and declined to reinstate a ban on same - sex marriage in @entity44			0
adopting the rainbow ' peace ' flag as it 's symbol , the early gay pride parades of 44 years ago depict a community coming out of the shadows and a little more reserved than today 's colorful marches			2
the @entity54 archives has some pictures of the first - ever pride parades around the world ... brotherly love at @entity60 's first @entity5 rally : obtaining gay rights was hard work and serious business in 1972 equality for all : @entity60 's first @entity5 rally and march , june 11,1972 where it all began : @entity70 march and dance , @entity34 , june 27 , 1970 @entity34 parade : in the early morning hours of june 28 , 1969 , violent protests and street demonstrations took over the streets of @entity34 after a police raid of @entity77 @entity34 @entity70 1970 : the now - legendary @entity79 gay bar saw the @entity32 , these protests are commonly considered the tipping point and the birth of the modern gay rights movement on message : @entity70 march and dance , @entity34 , june 27 , 1970 all walkers and no floats in 1970 : @entity88 and @entity89 marching in 1st @entity90 north of the border : lesbian couple at @entity94 's first @entity93 , august 1972			1
who knows if they 're still together ? gay couple at @entity94 's first @entity93 , august 1972 : now in 2013 , @entity98 marked the 10th anniversary of its first same - sex marriage marching for a cause : for some equality is still a goal , not a reality , and the struggle is far from over @entity106 celebration , 1972 : the first marches were both serious and fun , and served to inspire the widening activist movement ; they were repeated in the following years fitting in instead of standing out : pride marchers wanted to be seen as the same , not different light - hearted : activists used humour to break the ice and win people to their cause coming together : it 's easy to forget these people were marching for something as much as in celebration of something !			1

the first marches were both serious and fun , and served to inspire the widening activist movement
more and more annual marches started up in other *cities* throughout the world
in @entity130 and @entity34 and the marches were called ' @entity132 '
in @entity35 and @entity36 they became known as ' @entity135 '
in the 1980s there was a *cultural* shift in the gay movement and the name ' @entity5 ' was adopted
many parades still have at least some of the *original* political or activist character even if it can feel like @entity146 !
