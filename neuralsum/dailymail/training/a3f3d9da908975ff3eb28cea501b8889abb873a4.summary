the car in which @entity8 and @entity10 's characters travelled in to the airport for @entity13 's immortal finale is going under the hammer next month			1
the 1940 @entity15 - which belonged to @entity8 's character @entity13 in the 1942 film - is expected to fetch $ 500,000 ( £ 312,000 ) at auction in @entity19 on november 25			1
this car looms large in the final act of @entity13 : @entity49 as captain @entity50 drives the car to the airport at gunpoint , with @entity8 as @entity13 in the front , and @entity10 playinng @entity55 and @entity56 as @entity13 in the back seat			1

' despite being 73 - years - old the car , which as part of @entity84 's fleet it featured in several other films including @entity87 , also starring @entity8 , only has 42,000 miles on the clock			1
the car itself would be ultra-rare even if its was n't attached to @entity8 's star status			1
only 230 @entity92 trunkback convertible phaetons were built in 1940 - and similar buicks from that time period have sold for around $ 500,000 ( £ 311,000 ) , so @entity8 's could go for higher			1
the car was originally bought from @entity84 's by famed ukelele player @entity97 in 1970 before being sold at auction twice since			2
it was last auctioned off in 1995			0
the auction has been put together with television channel @entity101			0
stunning : the interior of the car is a beautiful mix of beige and brown famous passengers : @entity10 's character sat on the back seat of the car in the film			1

star : @entity8 starred in the much loved 1942 film @entity127 , @entity46 ' director of entertainment memorabilia , said : ' we worked with @entity101 to reach out to some of the best collectors in the country and to curate , really , an auction that runs the gamut of film history			2
' we hold memorabilia auctions pretty regularly , but this is the first time we 've partnered with someone like them			0
' they are the best possible partner we could have			0
they really are carrying the torch forward in terms of evangelizing the love of classic movies			0
' @entity147 , @entity101 host , said of the @entity149 brown convertible phaeton : ' seeing it in a catalogue is not the same			0
i knew the car was here , and i walk in and it still takes your breath away a little bit			0
' i 'm as amazed as , i think , anybody else is here			0
' @entity13 had its world premiere on november 26 1942 in @entity19 and was released nationwide in the @entity161 in january 1943			2
it had a solid , if unspectacular initial run - the film was rushed out to take advantage of the @entity165 several weeks earlier			0
it won three @entity166 , including @entity167 and now regularly features near the top of lists of the greatest films of all time			0
