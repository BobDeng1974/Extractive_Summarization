lava from @entity2 's @entity1 volcano continues to move slowly through a vacant lot in a rural subdivision			2
@entity2 spokesman @entity5 says it looks like the lava will bypass homes in the @entity10 subdivision			2
he says that as of tuesday , the lava is about 19 days from reaching @entity12			1
a geologist from the @entity14 using a radar gun to measure the speed of the lava flow from the june 27th flow from the @entity1 in @entity12 , @entity2 @entity2 spokesman @entity5 said the slow - moving lava is expected to bypass homes in the @entity10 subdivision , and the lava is about 5 days from reaching @entity12 the road is the main drag though @entity12 and from there , it could reach @entity24 130			1
the highway is a lifeline for residents living on the @entity2 's @entity29 district			2
workers continue to prepare unpaved roads to be used as alternate routes in case lava crosses the highway			1
the lava has slowed in recent days			1
@entity36 says it advanced 270 yards since monday			0
the flow is about 100 yards wide			0
@entity14 scientists say the lava has moved an average of about 890 feet a day since monday , slightly higher than the rate of about 705 feet a day between friday and sunday the slow - moving lava is expected to bypass homes in the @entity10 subdivision , and the lava is about 5 days from reaching @entity12 according to today 's report from the @entity48 @entity14 , the flow continues to advance northeast through thick forest , moving at an average of 890 feet a day in the last three days , traveling 11.3 miles from the vent			1
smoke billows from where the lava ' engulfs trees and other vegetation , ' the report notes , though fires are fortunately not spreading away from the flow			2
scientists predict it could cross @entity62 , fewer than 2.7 miles away , as early as september 24 , and then move onto block @entity63			2
but unpredictability is part of the problem : the flow emerged june 27 , but went underground for quite a while before returning to the surface in late august , with several disappearances and re-emergences since then			0
the direction and speed of the flow have also shifted slightly — though not for the better — since scientists began monitoring it			0
@entity78 : this map shows the location of the volcano and the small community of @entity12 which could be cut off entirely if the lava flow crosses the nearby highway 130 road @entity1 has been erupting continuously since 1983			1
scientists issued a warning last week when a lava flow that has been advancing through cracks in the earth for the past few months moved to within a mile of a rural subdivision			0
the flow since has slowed , but the @entity14 said it could reach the northwest edge of @entity10 in a day - and - a - half			0
the county has n't ordered any evacuations , however			1
officials also are preparing for the possibility that the lava will cross @entity24 130 , which links @entity99 and the sprawling , mostly rural district of @entity29 to @entity101			1
this could happen within weeks			0
@entity2 civil defense director @entity103 said lava has covered other major @entity2 roads in the past , like a state highway in @entity107 and @entity108 which is partially in @entity109			1
surf shop co-owner @entity110 said there ís a threat @entity99 could become a ghost town if lava from @entity1 volcano crosses roads connecting the village with the rest of the @entity2 the part of @entity24 that could be cut off is used by 7,000 to 11,000 vehicles per day , he said			0
the county is quickly trying to prepare alternate routes for people to use those who live on the slopes of @entity1 know lava could start creeping their way at any time but the area is still a powerful draw for many who value its community and affordability lava flow from the @entity1 volcano is approaching the boundary of the @entity138 division on the @entity2 of @entity2			1
@entity2 has declared a state of emergency with lava now less than 1.6 km from houses a vent on the volcano began oozing lava on 27 june 2014 , moving downhill at up to 240 meter per day the flow emerged from a vent at @entity1 's @entity148 crater in late june			0
since then , it has traveled nearly 9 miles as the crow flies , or just over 10 miles if its twists and turns are accounted for			0
the lava is creeping through thick forest , setting alight trees and generating smoke plumes			0
it is visible only from the air , unlike previous flows that tourists could watch drop into the ocean from coastal viewing areas			0
the @entity14 issued a warning to a rural community in the path of a lava flow on @entity2 's @entity2 , as the molten rock moved to within a mile of homes lava from one of the world 's most active volcanos has been advancing at a slower pace the past few days and is now moving parallel to a sparsely populated subdivision on @entity2 's @entity2			1

@entity48 says the lava could cross a major highway within the next five days
no evacuations have been ordered , but access to *roadways* to the community is restricted
