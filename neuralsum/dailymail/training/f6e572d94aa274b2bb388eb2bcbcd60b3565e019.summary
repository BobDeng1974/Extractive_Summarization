by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 05:12 est , 2 july 2013 updated : 09:21 est , 2 july 2013 @entity2 today put himself on a collision course with @entity4 as he revived calls for an amnesty for illegal immigrants			1
the mayor of @entity9 said the government had to be ' honest ' that when someone has been in @entity12 for 15 or 20 years ' authorities no longer really pursue you '			1
but the prime minister has rejected the idea , warning last week that it would send out a ‘ terrible signal of @entity12 as a soft touch ’			1
but mr @entity2 said the failure of border agency staff and the police to find illegal immigrants and send them home meant there was already effectively an amnesty in place			0
and he blamed ' ambulance - chasing lawyers ' who clogged up the legal system with repeated appeals against deportation			2
appearing on his new monthly radio phone - in on @entity44 , the @entity42 said : ' this is a chronic problem and if you look at what has happened in this country over the last 20 years , we have continuously failed to evict anybody			1
‘ if you look at the number of people who are staying here illegally and you measure that against the number that are meant to be on planes , it is absolutely astonishingly small			2
‘ the culture of human rights , the immense power of the ambulance - chasing lawyers who immediately come in and offer people protection against eviction , insert all sorts of delays into the procedure			1
it is blindingly difficult to get people on to planes			2
‘ they melt away into the maquis , into the undergrowth , and they are lost again			0
it is one of the reasons people lost confidence in the immigration system			2
’ ask @entity2 : mr @entity2 was speaking on his new monthly radio phone - in about the government 's approach to immigration checks : mr @entity2 told co-host @entity80 ( left ) that the authorities stop looking for people who have been in the @entity12 illegally for 15 or 20 years mr @entity2 said he remained convinced about the need for an amnesty despite the fact that mr @entity4 and other party leaders ‘ turned their machine guns on me ’ when he first suggested it in 2008			1
‘ we effectively have it , ’ he said after being asked about a recent operation to remove dozens of @entity92 squatters from a derelict former football club in the capital			0
‘ if you have been here for 10 or 12 years , i ’m afraid the authorities no longer really pursue you			1
why not be honest about what is going on ? @entity2 today revealed he could be tempted to run for mayor again - but only if hundreds of thousands of people line the streets demanding it			2
the mayor of @entity9 dodged questions about his ambitions to be prime minister when his term ends in 2016			0
instead he revealed he has been talking to friends about the possibility of breaking his promise to only serve eight years in @entity113			2
mr @entity2 joked that he could be persuaded to stand again if @entity9 saw a ‘ @entity114 ’ , referring to the mass protests taking place in @entity117 against the @entity119 president			0
he said politicians should be careful not to ‘ do things for too long ’ but admitted that he had discussed the idea of staying on with friends			2
‘ you mean , if it was a sort of a ' reverse @entity114 ' situation ? if there were hundreds of thousands of people actively calling for an extension of the administration ? ’ he asked			0
‘ the truth is that there are so many things we are trying to do at the moment that i know i am not going to be able to get in in time for 2016 that it is becoming increasingly ... ‘ i wo n't deny it , it is something i think about and something that i 've even talked to friends about			0
' ‘ ultimately you have got to reflect reality			0
otherwise they are not engaged in the economy , they are not being honest with the system , they are not paying their taxes properly and it is completely crazy			1
‘ but the key thing is to kick ‘ em out - get them before they hit first base			0
stop them coming in in such numbers and be much , much tougher in your general approach to borders			0
’ the @entity157 suggested an amnesty in their 2010 election manifesto , but leader @entity160 ditched the policy in march because it was ' seen by many as a reward for breaking the law '			0
last week @entity166 mp @entity165 claimed offering an amnesty to more than half a million illegal migrants would make financial sense by enabling them to pay tax rather than subsisting on cash - in - hand jobs			1
it would boost @entity166 support among ethnic minorities and stop the undercutting of low - income workers , mr @entity165 claimed			1
but he was slapped down by mr @entity4 , who said : ‘ it ’s not what we are going to implement			1
i ’ve never supported an amnesty			0
‘ i think that it would send a terrible signal of @entity12 as a soft touch			1
‘ what this government is doing is making sure we have strong control of our borders , strong control of immigration , a proper policy of returning people who do n’t have a right to be in the @entity12			1
’ today mr @entity165 insisted he and mr @entity2 were proposing the ' sensible approach '			0
' we have got to tackle this issue because we have got to create harmonious societies , ' he told @entity197 's @entity198			0
' there are people who 've been here for 12 or 15 years working in the cash economy , the black economy			1
' if you can bring them out of the shadows , bring them into the real economy , they can contribute to the tax system ... gbp3 billion a year , according to the @entity210			0
' coupled with that , you need rigour in your immigration system , border checks , @entity216 being able to get people out of the country , not allowing them to use ... human rights legislation			0
' warning : @entity4 rejected the idea of an amnesty during a @entity223 press conference last week , insisting it would paint @entity12 as a ' soft touch ' the mayor fielded a lot of calls about @entity9 ’s bus and rail system , and defended controversial bonuses given to transport bosses following last year ’s @entity233			1
he has followed mr @entity160 in hosting a regular phone - in , although the deputy prime minister answers calls one a week			0
after @entity4 was accused of jinxing tennis star @entity237 by tweeting a message of support , mr @entity2 declined to use the radio appearance to wish @entity242 good luck at @entity243			1
‘ if i say ` go @entity242 ! ’ or something like that , i will be accused of blighting his chances , ’ he joked			0
however , he did not blame the prime minister for cheering on @entity12 sports heroes who have later gone down to defeat			2
‘ @entity4 , like all politicians , wants to offer support to great @entity12 athletic stars , ’ he said .			1

@entity42 says it is ' completely crazy ' that people who have been in the @entity12 for years are not paying taxes
says the authorities stop chasing people here for 15 or 20 years
@entity4 slapped down a similar idea from a @entity166 mp last week
