' i think by a combination of a @entity23 drug you used that night and the revelation of something possibly to do with @entity101 on the part of mr @entity2 you lost it			2
' you got a knife from the block and went upstairs and , cool as a cucumber , you slit his throat			0
anyone listening to this must realise how serious this offending is			0
