by @entity0 last updated at 9:23 pm on 24th november 2011 she can deal , she can shuffle , she even knows how to bluff , but what makes @entity4 ’s talent unique is that she is only eight - years - old			1
having learnt to play poker at the age of just three , she is now taking on experienced card sharks more than seven times her age and is thought to be the youngest poker player in the world			1
a poker magazine has dubbed her a ' child prodigy ' and she can play over 50 varieties of the game , making her a veritable threat on the poker scene in her home town in @entity18			1
the @entity18 that can hold'em : @entity4 might only be eight - years - old but she can deal , shuffle and knows how to bluff she even snubbed @entity20 last year , instead begging her parents to take her to @entity22 to hunt autographs at the @entity25 tournaments			1
there she got an autograph from professional @entity28 on her hat that reads , ' see you in 2024 ! ' , which is when she will finally be of legal age to enter the @entity25 herself			2
at home in @entity34 , near @entity35 , she takes on grown men at the game they have been playing for decades , frequently pummelling the competition in weekly charity contests			1
and her father @entity40 , 35 , a house husband and fellow poker enthusiast , thinks his daughter could be the next big thing in professional poker			1
in the game : @entity4 pictured competing in a charity tournament he said : ‘ i know @entity48 could play poker with the best players in the world and definitely hold her own			1
‘ i also know she would be more than comfortable playing the professionals at the large buy - in events that many top name players are known for			2
‘ when @entity48 was three , i would have @entity57 and poker shows on in the background and she was attracted to the clapping and the sounds of people being happy on the television			2
‘ i used playing cards to help her count and to help with her maths skills when she was young and before she attended school			1
‘ as she began to learn which cards were higher , such as the aces , kings , queens and jacks in relation to the numbers , plus recognising what a pair , a flush , a three of a kind were , it was time to get poker chips			0
’ @entity81 came plastic playing cards , chips with values on them and a dealer button			0
by the age of four , she was shuffling , dealing , learning about basic tell signs and bluffing strategies			0
by age five , she knew @entity91 solidly			1
from there , @entity40 introduced her to other games , such as @entity94 and @entity95 , and by the age of six , she knew all of the @entity25 games , along with @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , and ace - to - five and triple - draw lowball			0
@entity48 has since played in several charity poker tournaments where players pay to enter or donate to local charities in order to circumvent local gambling laws			0
she played her first ever live poker tournament charity event at the age of seven			1
she set an age record at her first live tournament in 2009 , outlasting well over half the field - including her father - and becoming an instant local celebrity			1
during a tournament poker charity event last year she ended up making the final table that evening and finishing in 6th place			0
she said : ‘ the neat thing about poker is there are a lot of games to choose from and they are easy to learn and play			2
idols : @entity48 snubbed meeting @entity127 and @entity128 at @entity20 , to instead meet her poker idol @entity28 ( right ) at the @entity130 in @entity22 world series : she begged her parents to take her to @entity22 to hunt autographs at the @entity134 ( library image ) ‘ i know how to shuffle and deal the cards , raise , check , fold , and bluff			0
i also know how to play deuce - to - seven @entity138 , @entity139 , and @entity99			0
‘ i can now play any poker game with the best poker players in the world			1
‘ with me being a girl , when i am a professional poker player i hope i can inspire other girls and women to play poker too			2
’ as far as her parents know , @entity48 does not play poker with her schoolmates , but she is allowed to play for money - her cash allowance for doing chores around the house - because it teaches her money management			2
they gave her some money to start with , and now she has a bank account			0
her first win from a major cash game was $ 42 , and her first loss was $ 25 , while in @entity22			0
ultimately @entity48 's ambition is to be a professional poker player , and her parents are more than happy to encourage the youngster to follow her dreams			0
in addition , @entity48 juggles poker with rock climbing , @entity167 classes , football and weekly volleyball practices .			0

@entity4 started playing poker aged three and now takes on card sharks seven times her age

her father taught her the game to *improve* her maths skills
