before we get into @entity2 ’s rating for his masterful display against two of the most mediocre midfield performers in @entity7 ’s recent history , first some insight			1
this is my long - held view , but the match ratings are a complete waste of time			2
they are not based on a calculations from @entity16 , heat maps , passing percentages and touches of the ball to give a considered statistical view after careful analysis			0
@entity25 's @entity24 playmaker @entity2 produced a masterful performance in his side 's 2 - 0 win at @entity7 on sunday ... but it was only worthy of a rating of 7/10 online and 7.5 in monday 's @entity32 @entity2 skips past the grounded @entity33 during @entity25 's win at the @entity35 @entity2 scores his penalty to give @entity25 a lead midway through the first half on sunday click here to read @entity41 's ratings from the @entity35 in full they are done by one person who is responsible for umpteen other duties , often at the same time , under the pressure of deadlines of website and newspaper			1
it means studying 22 players plus substitutes , along with the referee , both managers and sending it on the final whistle			0
within minutes it is online			0
@entity2 was the go - to man on sunday , an easy pick because he scored a penalty and sent in the free - kick for @entity61 to score @entity25 ’s second			1
@entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 gave him 8/10 , he was 9/10 in the @entity66 and good luck to them			0
he was man of the match - and there was a case for it - in the @entity72 and the @entity73 , but not for me			2
life would be easier if i followed the golden rule - give the highest mark to the player who scored the winner , or set it up - and you wo n’t get clubbed to death on @entity82			1
@entity2 delivered the free - kick from which @entity61 ( right ) headed @entity25 's second goal @entity85 tries to close down @entity2 as the @entity25 man picks yet another pass how @entity88 's @entity41 rated @entity25 's midfield and forward line in monday 's @entity32 this is the life of a football reporter , looking up from a laptop screen and hoping to see a killer pass or a key decision in real time			1
if you do n’t , you ask a colleague sitting next to you for his opinion or pray to @entity100 that a crackly tv in the press box is a ) working and b ) about to show a replay			0
there is no time , so there is a reliance to use obvious match - winning contributions , such as a penalty struck with conviction in the 23rd minute or a free - kick in the 67th , to stand out			0
there is no hard and fast rule about marking players out of 10 because people will aggregate them based on various values , all of them refined over a period of years based on past experiences			0
perhaps it is little wonder @entity2 stood out for so many people because it is so rare for him to have this kind of influence on a game			1
@entity2 is a good player , but not a great and let ’s not pretend otherwise			1
yes perhaps he probably did deserve more than a 7 ( online ) and 7.5 in a considered appraisal in the paper , but good @entity100 you would think there was a fire judging by the social media feeds , along with the customary email from the @entity136			0
there is no need for an alarm in my house any more because he takes care of it before 6am after a game with his complaints , because i did n’t read the game the same way as he did			0
i got one after @entity149 v @entity148 and another this morning			0
this game could easily have seen @entity150 , stationed in front of @entity25 ’s back four , or @entity153 given man of the match for his job on @entity156			1
but there is an alternative , which is to scan the team - sheet before kick - off and think that some poor soul like @entity61 will have his work cut out today in a 4 - 1 - 4 - 1			2
he was the real man of the match , busting his balls as he worked the line across one of the best - and certainly most expensive - defences in the @entity167			2
@entity150 was also possibly worthy of the man of the match accolade for his performance @entity25 defender @entity153 ( left ) kept a close check on danger man @entity156 @entity61 was @entity41 's choice for star man after taking on @entity7 's formidable back line it was interesting to learn that @entity176 - a man who really does have a full appreciation and understanding of the game - gave @entity61 man of the match on @entity182 on monday morning , but what would he know , eh ? there are people ( myself included ) who will tell you that @entity188 is the best right - back in the history of the @entity167			1
let ’s pause there for a moment			0
then there are @entity7 supporters who would scream at you in the street if you dare to claim that @entity198 is a better central defender than their captain @entity199			2
tougher to make a case for @entity201 , but let ’s not pretend he did n't win four @entity205 titles with @entity206 , one @entity167 title with @entity7 or start the 2014 world cup final against @entity209			2
@entity61 takes on @entity7 defender @entity201 during the match at the @entity35 there is also @entity212 , a decent enough left back but without being anything special			1
four , plus the formidable presence of @entity7 keeper @entity215 , against one is not a fair fight			2
@entity61 still managed to play a part in the move that led to @entity25 ’s opening goal and finished the game off when he read @entity2 ’s free - kick to steer the ball beyond @entity215			1
that is why @entity61 was man of the match			1
the beauty about football is that it is all about opinions			0
and that ’s mine .			0

@entity88 's @entity41 *awarded* @entity2 a rating of 7
@entity2 scored the first goal and set up @entity61 for the second
but ratings should take into account far more than this
that 's why @entity61 was more deserving of the star man award
he took on @entity7 's *daunting* back line without fear and scored *crucial* goal
