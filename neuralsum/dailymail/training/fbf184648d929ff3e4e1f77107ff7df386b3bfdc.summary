an @entity1 refugee who made ‘ dubious ’ claims about having cancer , falling and injuring himself , and his father dying so he could continue to receive disability welfare while overseas finally came unstuck when the @entity6 refused to believe he ’d received death threats from @entity1 insurgents			1
@entity9 , who has a degree in chemical engineering but has never worked in @entity12 , first legitimately claimed @entity13 - which can be $ 800 a month - for his spinal scoliosis in 2003 when he arrived in the country on a humanitarian visa			1
however , over the past decade mr @entity9 left @entity12 to visit @entity1 on four separate occasions – remaining outside of @entity12 for longer than the 13 - weeks allowed in order to still receive @entity13			1
each time he sought extensions to his ‘ portability period ’ with excuses such as his father had died ( it later turned out to be his divorced wife ’s father ) and that he had cancer , which there is no medical record of			2
@entity9 's appeal to keep his disability welfare has been rejected after a tribunal concluded he did not have any evidence to prove his life was threatened in @entity1 that stopped him from returning to @entity12 it was n’t until his final trip to @entity1 , on 30 november 2012 , that the 54 - year - old came unstuck for his absences when the @entity38 claimed his life was in danger from @entity40 in his home country			1
mr @entity9 did not notify @entity42 that he was going overseas this time and after email correspondence - where he asked to be allowed to still claim - @entity42 refused the request and decided that the @entity13 should be cancelled from 1 march 2013			1
his @entity47 ( @entity46 ) instalments were also cancelled as of 22 march 2013 after he failed to provide an estimate of his income			0
after the @entity50 agreed to stop his payments on the recommendation of @entity42 , a determined mr @entity9 took his case to the @entity54			1
residence in @entity12 is a pre-condition for receipt of a dsp			2
if recipients go overseas they are required to notify @entity42 in advance			0
there is a 13 - week portability period - the period you can still claim while overseas - for @entity13			1
he arrived back in @entity12 on 1 march 2014 and claimed he was unable to leave @entity64 before because of death and kidnapping threats made by insurgents			1
senior tribunal member @entity68 said in an @entity54 , in @entity69 on october 24 , that he ‘ did not accept the applicant ’s account for a number of reasons ’			2
the reasons included the fact mr @entity9 made no contact with the @entity12 embassy in @entity64 ‘ and resisted all efforts to have him contact it			1
i infer that this was because he knew that any embassy enquiry would show he was not under any threat ’			0
the judgement went on : ‘ the applicant has a history of overstaying his absences and seeking extensions of the portability period for dubious reasons and , having regard to all the evidence before me , i consider that this is what occurred on this occasion			0
’ mr @entity97 said there was ‘ no independent corroboration ’ and that ‘ the applicant was a very unsatisfactory witness , being evasive , contradictory and inconsistent in his demeanour and responses to questions ’			0
mr @entity9 refused to attend the hearing in person for cross-examination			2
‘ i do not accept that he received any threat to his life or well - being in @entity64 , ’ mr @entity97 concluded			2
in the @entity54 the full list of outrageous claims mr @entity9 made to the @entity6 over ten years to try and keep his welfare payments while overseas were also revealed			1
in 2007 , he claimed he left @entity12 because his dad was very ill and died two days after he arrived			1
‘ at the hearing , the applicant ( having given evidence that his father was alive in 2012 ) said that the deceased in 2007 was his wife ’s father			0
i note that the applicant and his wife separated in 2006 , were divorced on 23 january 2007 , and the applicant professed to know nothing of his wife ’s whereabouts or activities “ for the last 8 years ” , ’ mr @entity97 said			0
during the 2008 trip , he claimed that he had fallen and hurt himself , and was granted another extension			2
on 23 february 2010 , he advised that he had been diagnosed with cancer and was receiving chemotherapy			0
extensions to his portability period were granted until april , and then june and , finally , august 2010			0
his further application for an extension on 30 august 2010 was refused because he did not provide any current treatment information			0
he appealed that decision to the @entity50 but was unsuccessful			0
‘ in evidence to this @entity54 , the applicant said that his abdominal cancer had been diagnosed on biopsy in @entity140 and chemotherapy commenced			0
‘ later , he consulted doctors in @entity143 and was told that it had all been a mistake and he had no cancer			0
he did not bring back to @entity12 any hospital or medical reports , x-rays or pathology results , ’ mr @entity97 revealed .			1

@entity9 arrived in @entity12 in 2003 and started receiving @entity13 for his spinal scoliosis
over ten years he travelled to his home country of @entity1 four times
each time he visited he applied for an extension on the time he could be outside @entity12 and still receive his welfare payments
the *maximum* time is *ordinarily* 13 weeks but from 2012 he left for *78* weeks
he claimed his life had been threatened by insurgents and he could **n't** get back to @entity12
a tribunal did **n't** accept his excuses and called his previous stories ' dubious '
