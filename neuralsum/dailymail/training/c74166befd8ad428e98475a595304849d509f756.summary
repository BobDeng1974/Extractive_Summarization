the @entity0 is on course to have a controversial face scanning system and database up and running by the summer			1
new documents released by the @entity5 reveal the system is capable of processing 55,000 faces a day - and that it will have 52 million faces by 2015			1
the database , shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal , state and local law enforcement agencies across the @entity12 , already has 7 - 8 million individuals			1
the database , shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal , state and local law enforcement agencies across the @entity12 , already has 7 - 8 million individuals loaded			1
the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) system builds on the @entity0 ’s legacy fingerprint database , which already contains well over 100 million individual records , and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data , including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data			1
@entity16 combines all these forms of data in each individual ’s file , linking them to personal and biographic data like name , home address , id number , immigration status , age , race , etc. this immense database is shared with other federal agencies and with the approximately 18,000 tribal , state and local law enforcement agencies across the @entity12			2
however , the extent of the system has not been revealed until now			0
' the records we received show that the face recognition component of @entity16 may include as many as 52 million face images by 2015 , ' the @entity5 's @entity43 said			2
the latest documents also reveal that non-criminal photos will be included			0
' one of our biggest concerns about @entity16 has been the fact that it will include non-criminal as well as criminal face images , ' the @entity5 said			1
' we now know that @entity0 projects that by 2015 , the database will include 4.3 million images taken for non-criminal purposes			1
the @entity5 received the records in response to a @entity63 lawsuit for information on @entity16 ( @entity16 )			0
the system builds on the @entity0 ’s legacy fingerprint database , which already contains well over 100 million individual records , and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data , including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data			1

by 2012 , @entity16 already contained 13.6 million images representing between 7 and 8 million individuals , and by the middle of 2013 , the size of the database increased to 16 million images			1
the new records reveal that the database will be capable of processing 55,000 direct photo enrollments daily and of conducting tens of thousands of searches every day			1
currently , if you apply for any type of job that requires fingerprinting or a background check , your prints are sent to and stored by the @entity0 in its civil print database			0
however , the @entity0 has never before collected a photograph along with those prints - but this is changing with @entity16			0
now an employer could require you to provide a ' mug shot ' photo along with your fingerprints			0
if that ’s the case , then the @entity0 will store both your face print and your fingerprints along with your biographic data			0
the new system also link criminal and non-criminal fingerprint databases			0
every record — whether criminal or non — will have a “ @entity123 ” ( @entity123 ) , and every search will be run against all records in the database			0
' this means that even if you have never been arrested for a crime , if your employer requires you to submit a photo as part of your background check , your face image could be searched — and you could be implicated as a criminal suspect — just by virtue of having that image in the non-criminal file , sayd the @entity5 it says the new system raises major privacy concerns			2
the system builds on the @entity0 ¿ s legacy fingerprint database , which already contains well over 100 million individual records , and has been designed to include multiple forms of biometric data , including palm prints and iris scans in addition to fingerprints and face recognition data			1
' @entity16 will allow law enforcement at all levels to search non-criminal and criminal face records at the same time			0
' this means you could become a suspect in a criminal case merely because you applied for a job that required you to submit a photo with your background check			0
the states taking part in the project ' second , the @entity0 and @entity162 have thus far failed to enact meaningful restrictions on what types of data can be submitted to the system , who can access the data , and how the data can be used			0
' this is not how our system of justice was designed and should not be a system that @entity12 tacitly consent to move towards			2

*campaigners* say database poses ' real *threats* to privacy ' for @entity12
system is capable of processing 55,000 faces a day
7 - 8 million *people* have already been *uploaded*
will include non-criminal images
