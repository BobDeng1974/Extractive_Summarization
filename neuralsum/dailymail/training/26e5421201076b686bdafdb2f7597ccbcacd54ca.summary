by @entity0 the drone delivery dreams of @entity3 boss @entity2 have come crashing down after regulators ruled that delivery services are too dangerous			1
the @entity6 has said that @entity3 and other firms can not use drones to deliver packages			1
the ruling is part of an @entity6 document seeking public comment on its policy on drones , or what the agency calls ' model aircraft			1
customers would have their order dropped onto their front lawn by the machine which would fly through the air from a nearby warehouse with it clasped in a metal grabber			0
firms such as @entity40 are also working on drone delivery projects			0
under a graphic that says what is barred , the @entity6 mentioned the ' delivering of packages to people for a fee			1
' this is clarified in a footnote saying : ' if an individual offers free shipping in association with a purchase or other offer , @entity6 would construe the shipping to be in furtherance of a business purpose , and thus , the operation would not fall within the statutory requirement of recreation or hobby purpose			2
' the agency has said that it would revisit the commercial application of small drones later this year , with potential new rules in place perhaps by the end of 2015			2
@entity68 , the @entity69 lawyer who convinced a federal judge to declare that the @entity6 is illegally enforcing a commercial ban on drones , told @entity73 the new rules were an attack on commercial use of drones			1
' it 's a purported new legal basis telling people to stop operating model aircraft for business purposes , ' he said			1
@entity3 has admitted the project may take some time			2
' putting @entity21 into commercial use will take some number of years as we advance the technology and wait for the necessary @entity6 rules and regulations , ' the firm has previously warned			2
@entity3 is serious about using drones to deliver items to its customers , and is close to developing the technology to make it a reality , the company 's ceo has claimed			1
on their way : @entity27 said testing of ' 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles ' was currently underway , adding that more drones - perhaps the models that will be put into active service - were in the design phase in his annual letter to shareholders , which was made public earlier this year , @entity27 gave an update on the @entity111 - based company 's achievements in 2013 - including a reference to drone development			2
@entity2 said testing of ' 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles ' was currently underway , adding that more drones - perhaps the models that will be put into active service - were in the design phase			0
@entity2 made reference to a @entity3 's ' @entity21 ' team carrying out the drone testing during his letter to shareholders			2
@entity3 describes @entity21 as ' a new delivery system that will get packages into customers ' hands in 30 minutes or less using unmanned aerial vehicles '			1
ongoing : @entity27 said @entity3 is continuing to develop and test technology for delivery drones earlier in the letter , @entity2 said @entity3 had made dramatic improvements to its delivery service in 2013 - including offering sunday delivery in selected @entity136 cities , introducing ' last mile ' delivery networks in the @entity138 , and employing bike couriers in countries where deliveries could be slowed down by postal difficulties , such as @entity143 and @entity144			1
he then added : ' and there is more invention to come			0
' the prime air team is already flight testing our 5th and 6th generation aerial vehicles , and we are in the design phase on generations 7 and 8			0
' this brief reference to @entity21 has been enough to lead to renewed speculation over when customers can expect to have their items delivered by drone			0
a recent court ruling removed one not - insignificant obstacle in @entity3 's quest , by removing the @entity6 's authority to ban small unmanned aircraft being flown over @entity136 airspace for commercial purposes			1
this effectively gave businesses the right to fly small drones for the purposes of professional photography , journalism or farmland surveying			0
it also , theoretically , allowed @entity3 to introduce a drone - based delivery service - until the rules were clarified today			0
in his letter to shareholders , @entity2 remained realistic about the chances of @entity21 testing turning into an fully - fledged delivery service , however			0
' failure comes part and parcel with invention			0
it â€™s not optional ' , he said			0
@entity2 went on to explain that @entity3 would continuing working on drones ' until we get it right ' and it becomes ' something that is really working for customers			1
' ' [ at that point ] we double - down on it with hopes to turn it into an even bigger success ' , @entity2 added .			0
