@entity0 's could have its own time zone under plans to move the @entity3 to @entity4			1
the campaign to shift the @entity3 forward an hour , aligning the nation with most of @entity7 , is supported by a wide range of mps , who claim the change would save lives on the road thanks to extra sunlight			1
@entity0 has been opposed to the change in the past , but campaigners say @entity15 could devolve powers allowing @entity0 to set their own time			1
but @entity31 , chief executive of the @entity32 , said that allowing @entity0 to stick with the norm while the @entity3 changes time zone was a possibility			1
in a letter to mr @entity24 , who is the leader of the @entity37 and is chairing a government committee on devolving powers to @entity40 , mr @entity31 said the change could save 80 lives and prevent hundreds of injuries			1
according to @entity44 , he wrote : ' paradoxically , there seems to be more political resistance to this proposed change in @entity0 , which stands to gain disproportionately from the initiative , although the majority of people in @entity0 do not appear to be against it			0
' however , in @entity56 , where the appetite for change is greater still , many more people are killed and injured because of the time zone misalignment that both countries suffer			1
' it is the perceived resistance in @entity0 that is causing so many lives to be lost and diminished across the @entity3 , and this could be a prime opportunity for the two governments to make thier decisions on this issue independently			2
' yesterday it was announced that the drink drive limit will be cut from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from december 5 in @entity0 , but not @entity56 and @entity72 @entity73 , president of the @entity74 , also backed the move , but said it would come with ' practical difficulties '			0
he said : ' our view is that it would be best if it was changed in @entity56 and @entity72 to see the benefits and then the @entity0 can decide for themselves			0
' it would be slightly awkward , though , if you had difference opening hours in @entity0 and @entity56			0
there might be practical difficulties			0
' the move is largely driven by road safety , which @entity0 already assumes powers for			2
yesterday @entity0 justice secretary @entity88 announced plans to cut the drink - drive limit north of the border by @entity92			0
the blood alcohol limit will be reduced from 80mg in every 100ml of blood to 50mg from december 5			0
it would bring @entity0 in line with the rest of @entity7 , but would mean the limit is lower than that in @entity56 and @entity72 .			2

@entity0 could have its own time zone under plans handed to government
campaigners want @entity3 to move forward an hour to save lives on the roads
but @entity0 has *previously* been against changing to @entity7 time
@entity40 could be handed the power to *choose* @entity0 's time zone
*compromise* would see rest of the @entity3 change clocks and leave @entity0 behind
move could save lives on the road and prevent hundreds of injuries
