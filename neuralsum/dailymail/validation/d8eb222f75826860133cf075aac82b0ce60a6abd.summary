@entity1 's problems are mounting but he refused to concede the title despite suffering a hugely damaging defeat at @entity4			1
coming so soon after losing 2 - 1 to @entity5 in the @entity6 needed a show of character against @entity9 but got the opposite , and the @entity12 manager admitted the performance was not good enough			1
the defeat leaves @entity6 five points behind @entity16 having played a game more , but @entity1 saw @entity6 pull their dream of becoming champions out of the fire last season and he hopes history will repeat itself , even though time is running out			1
@entity1 is refusing to accept defeat in the title race despite seeing @entity12 lose again @entity1 ( left ) looks on despondently as he shakes the hands of @entity27 ( right ) at full - time ‘ i think we never give up about the title , ’ said @entity1			1
‘ we must try to improve our play first and after that try to win our next game			2
you never know in football what will happen			0
' it is more difficult when you have less games and you continue with the same points			0
‘ but i do n’t think the team can think about that			0
the team must think about how we can win the next game			2
' there were a lot of problems			0
there were two goals from @entity9 , very good goals in the top corner			2
we missed three clear chances			0
it was a close game			0
‘ @entity9 played very well and they deserved to win			1
i am concerned about the whole team			0
we were playing very well against @entity53 and @entity54			0
@entity55 lets fly from range to score the winning goal for @entity9 against @entity6 @entity58 is left helpless as @entity55 's effort rises above his outstretched hand and hits the back of the net @entity9 were pegged back as @entity63 finished off a delightful team passing move ' we start this week against @entity5 and then ( here ) , it was not our team , we can not lose so many balls with the technical players we have			1
‘ that is more important to analyse than the performance of one player			0
it is more important to think as a team			0
’ if @entity1 was disconsolate , @entity27 was exultant and he hailed @entity55 ’s latest magical display as the @entity77 catapulted @entity9 firmly into the @entity6 race			1
@entity9 extended their unbeaten run in the @entity80 to an 11th game and @entity55 ’s role in inspiring the win was crucial , not least when he scored a sublime 75th - minute goal			1
@entity55 ’s influence on the team has grown in recent weeks , with three goals in his last seven appearances , and @entity27 feels the key to this consistency stems from him having peace of mind after signing a long - term contract last month			1
@entity9 boss @entity27 ca n't hide his joy at the final whistle as @entity9 edged out @entity6 he had been spared the long trip to @entity97 for the @entity99 tie against @entity100 in midweek and the benefits were obvious as his passing and movement tormented @entity1 ’s side			1
‘ it was a brilliant result and an equally brilliant performance , ’ @entity27 enthused			2
what made @entity9 ’s performance all the more meritorious , according to @entity27 , was that their preparations had been disrupted by the @entity99			1
they only returned to @entity112 at 4.30am on friday yet finished the stronger side on sunday			2
‘ it is a big win but we still have a lot of games to go , ’ said @entity27			2
‘ but it is a significant win for us , another three points			0
' to prepare yourself for a game against the champions is no mean feat. you have to take your hat off to them , the performance was at a real top level			0

@entity12 lost 2 - 1 at @entity9 on sunday *afternoon*
the champions are five points behind @entity16 in the @entity80 title race - and have also played a game more
despite that manager @entity1 *insists* his players will never give up on the title despite it now looking *improbable* they will retain it
elsewhere , @entity9 boss @entity27 hailed his side after the win
the @entity144 have now taken *20* points from a possible *24* in *20*15
