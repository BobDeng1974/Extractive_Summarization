@entity0 had some choice words for @entity2 on @entity3 wednesday after the actress used a surprise appearance at a tech conference to compare celebrities ridiculed on the internet to the plight of soldiers going through war			1
@entity2 was outside @entity12 at @entity14 's @entity13 speaking to @entity16 big wigs tuesday when she made the offhanded remark that has former pow @entity19 's wife , who 's also mother to two soldiers , so livid			1
' @entity2 is a joke , ' @entity19 balked wednesday night			1
' her life is like taking bullets for a soldier			0
what a joke ! my 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her			0
' a military mom 's wrath : @entity0 , wife of ex-pow senator @entity19 and mother to two soldiers ( left ) , has come out swinging over @entity2 's ( right ) suggestion that actors ridiculed on the internet are like soldiers at war not holding back : @entity19 's tweets came after @entity2 's comments while speaking at a tech conference			1
she 's was surprisingly uncensored for a politician 's wife the row began with the following comment @entity2 made onstage while discussing internet comments about the stars : ' you come across them about yourself and about your friends , and it 's a very dehumanizing thing			1
it 's almost like how , in war , you go through this bloody , dehumanizing thing , and then something is defined out of it			0
my hope is , as we get out of it , we 'll reach the next level of conscience , ' she said			0
it was a small part of what she said while sharing a stage with tech ceos , but was more than enough to infuriate the war hero 's wife			2
@entity71 and former presidential hopeful @entity19 was was taken as a prisoner of war as the third generation naval officer served as a pilot in @entity75 in 1967			1
senator @entity19 's plane was shot down by friendly fire and he would eventually spend five and a half years as an horifically abused prisoner before coming home to receive the @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity85 military honors			2
@entity0 on wednesday offered up a helpful suggestion to the @entity88 actress and self - styled lifestyle guru			0
' perhaps @entity2 should go out on patrol with some soldiers			1
kind of like a @entity93 in her mind i guess ! ' she tweeted			1
while the @entity98 founder 's appearance at the conference was a reaction to malevolent online attacks on her and her famous friends , any good it could have done has likely now been erased			0
which is nothing new for the recently single @entity2			0
a week before news of her ' conscious uncoupling ' from husband @entity107 broke , the 41 - year - old infuriated working women across @entity110 when she said they had it easier than famous acting moms			0
family affair : @entity19 's fury was fueled by the fact that her sons @entity118 ( left ) and @entity119 ( with @entity19 at right ) are both military men she had her reasons : @entity19 , pictured here with mrs. @entity0 at an @entity125 game this month , was an horrifically abused prisoner of war in @entity75 for five and a half years ' i think it 's different when you have an office job , because it 's routine and , you know , you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening , ' she told @entity135 ' i think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as , of course there are challenges , but it 's not like being on set			2
' many women were put off by the comments , but none as famously as mother @entity145 who made headlines with her open letter to @entity2 published in the @entity148 on march 27			1
' thank @entity150 i do nâ€™t make millions filming one movie per year is what i say to myself pretty much every morning , ' is one of many zingers in @entity155 letter , which no doubt helped put the normally aloof @entity2 on the defensive			0
on may 8th , she responded to the anger over her working mom comments with a @entity98 in which she drew a different sort of parallel with armed combat			0
co-parent : @entity2 's estranged husband @entity107 - who she recently separated with after 11 years of marriage - returned to @entity12 on thursday , where they still share a home together in the post titled ending the @entity173 , @entity2 wrote : ' why do we feel so entitled to opine , often so negatively , on the choices of other women ? as the mommy wars rage on , i am constantly perplexed and amazed by how little slack we cut each other as women , ' she wrote			2
for her part , @entity0 used thursday 's whirlwind of publicity around her attack on @entity2 to help publicize a good cause			0
' happy to have joined @ @entity187 to chat about # humantrafficking and @entity2 crazy statement , ' @entity19 tweeted			2
spreading the word : @entity19 tweeted about @entity2 's comments repeatedly in what appeared to be her attempt to make sure the off - handed comment did not go unnoticed			1

@entity2 made the comments during a surprise appearance at a tech conference outside @entity12 on tuesday
the enraged wife of @entity75 pow @entity19 and mother of two soldiers showed her *disdain* for the comparison in tweets posted wednesday
