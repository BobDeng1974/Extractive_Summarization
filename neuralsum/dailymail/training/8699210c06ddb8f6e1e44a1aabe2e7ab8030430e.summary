by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 23:51 est , 13 march 2013 updated : 23:51 est , 13 march 2013 a new feature on the @entity4 home page has given the video streaming site the authority to name and shame the internet service providers with the worst service			1
the company launched its own speed index earlier this week , which is sure to make the decision of which internet provider to subscribe to much easier			1
featured on the @entity4 website , the index is displayed in a ranking system as well as a graph that showcases each @entity18 's performance , measured in megabits per second ( @entity19 )			2
data : featured on the @entity4 website , the speed index is displayed in a ranking system as well as a graph that showcases each internet service provider 's performance , measured in megabits per second ( @entity19 ) @entity26 is the fastest isp by a longshot , with an average speed of 3.35 mbps			1
at the bottom of the list is @entity31 , with a meager 1.25 mbps			0
a pull - down menu also enables anyone to see the results by country			0
in the @entity37 , @entity36 is the top @entity18 and @entity38 is the slowest			0
the only provider that comes close to @entity26 's speed is @entity42 's @entity41 , which processes at 2.99 mbps			0
the speed index debuted as @entity4 jumped into the social networking arena in @entity45			1
another new feature , unveiled on wednesday , allows users to automatically see what their @entity49 friends have been watching , as long as they are willing to open a peephole into their own viewing habits			1
living social : another new feature allows @entity4 users to see what their @entity49 friends have been watching , as long as they are willing to open a peephole into their own viewing habits the feature was previously available outside of the @entity45 the expansion exposes the feature to a much wider audience because @entity4 has 27 million internet video subscribers in the @entity45 versus 6 million customers in more than 50 other countries and territories			1
@entity4 is n't creating an outlet for the 8.2 million subscribers to its steadily shrinking dvd - by - mail rental service to share what they 're checking out on discs			2
@entity4 withheld the sharing tool in the @entity45 to avoid breaking a 1988 law that banned the disclosure of video rental records without a customer 's written consent			2
money maker : @entity4 investors apparently believe the new features will increase the site 's popularity and , by extension , its profits after several years of lobbying , the @entity84 , @entity85 , company persuaded @entity87 to revise the law so that subscribers could choose to activate a video - sharing feature			1
president @entity91 signed the amended law in january , clearing the way for @entity4 to offer @entity45 subscribers another way to find movies and tv shows that may appeal to their tastes			0
in the process , @entity4 hopes to deepen subscriber loyalty and generate positive buzz about the $ 8 - per - month service as the company strives to reach its goal of reaching 90 million customers			2
' this has been a missing link for us , ' said @entity108 , @entity4 's vice president of product innovation			0
' being able to see more recommendations from your friends can be a very powerful thing			0
' investors apparently believe the new features will increase @entity4 's popularity and , by extension , its profits			0
@entity4 shares stock surged by $ 10.25 , or 5.6 per cent , to close at $ 192.36			0
the sharing tool could backfire if it raises privacy concerns as subscribers discover how much their @entity49 friends are finding out about their viewing preferences			2
@entity4 is trying to make sure that happens by corralling the sharing within individual subscriber accounts when the feature is first turned on			0
the company plans to offer all its @entity45 subscribers the option by the end of this week			0
once the sharing feature is activated , new rows labeled ' @entity132 ' and ' watched by your friends ' will be displayed within a subscriber 's account			0
dying breed : @entity4 is n't creating an outlet for the 8.2 million subscribers to its steadily shrinking dvd - by - mail rental service to share what they 're checking out on discs on the flip side , any subscriber who has signed up for @entity49 sharing will have their movie selections displayed with the accounts of their @entity49 friends unless an extra step is taken to exclude a specific movie or tv show			1
what subscribers are watching wo n't be posted on @entity49 's social network unless they go into their setting to permit the sharing on that website , too			1
beside the general rows of recommendations , @entity4 will also devote rows to the watching lists of up for five @entity49 friends that the company 's computer formulas will select , based on an analysis of common interests			1
@entity4 eventually hopes to allow subscribers to designate the @entity49 friends whose video opinions that they like the most , @entity108 said .			1

video streaming site launches speed index that compares internet service providers in *multiple* countries
service comes as @entity4 enters social arena with @entity49 feature that allows friends to see what a user is watching
