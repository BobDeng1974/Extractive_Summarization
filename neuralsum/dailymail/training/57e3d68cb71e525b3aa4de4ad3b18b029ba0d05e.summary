a study has identified a mechanism through which the food poisoning bug reduces the lung disease in mice			2
earlier research has suggested children who have been infected with salmonella are less likely to get asthma			1
asthma could be treated with probiotics that mimic the salmonella bug , new research suggests a leading theory is the ' hygiene hypothesis ' that reasons the surge in asthma cases has resulted from the modern world 's obsession with cleanliness , which is leaving immune systems undeveloped			1
dr @entity23 , of @entity24 in @entity25 , said the latest study found salmonella infection was linked with reduced airway inflammation			2
the findings , published in the journal @entity31 , open up new avenues of research that could lead to treatments			1
dr @entity23 traced the improvement to reduced production of an inflammatory compound called interleukin 4 which is produced by an immune cell known as @entity41 - 2			1
he found an increase in a certain type of ' myeloid ' immune cell was responsible for regulating the t helper - 2 cells to produce less interleukin - 4			0
myeloid cells include an array of immune cells and are ultimately derived from the bone marrow			0
@entity54 ( pictured ) infection is linked to reduced airway inflammation the research could lead to probiotic asthma treatments based on the use of the body 's harmless bacteria resembling @entity54 , or the application of myeloid cells as therapeutics , said dr @entity23			1
in the @entity64 5.4 million people are treated for asthma , or one in 11 children and one in 12 adults			2
on average , three people a day die from the condition			0
an estimated 75 per cent of hospital admissions for asthma are avoidable and 90 per cent of deaths preventable			0
it is more common in women than men			0
the @entity76 spends around Â £ 1 billion a year treating and caring for people with asthma .			0

children who have had salmonella are less likely to develop asthma
@entity54 reduces the production of an inflammatory compound
the research could lead to probiotic asthma treatments
