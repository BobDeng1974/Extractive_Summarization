' divisive ' : patients are left in corridors outside wards they should be in while waiting for a free bed hospitals are being encouraged to park seriously ill patients on trolleys in corridors to ease the @entity9 crisis			1
doctors say the controversial practice of ‘ boarding ’ – which amounts to letting wards overflow – is already being used at a number of under - pressure hospitals in @entity16			1
it involves putting patients on trolleys outside the wards they should be in while they wait for a free bed instead of keeping them in @entity9			1
rather than criticising the measure , desperate @entity9 doctors say boarding should be used more widely – even though they concede it is ‘ potentially toxic ’			2
they argue it is necessary to free up space in overcrowded casualty units			0
as a result , doctors at the influential @entity32 ( @entity32 ) have now given boarding their backing			1
but critics question its safety , amid fears that giving the green light to boarding could serve to legitimise overflowing @entity41 wards			1
dr @entity42 , an @entity9 consultant at @entity43 in @entity44 and a prominent @entity32 member , argued it was better to have patients waiting on corridor trolleys , after they had been seen and assessed , than languishing outside @entity9 in queuing ambulances			1
between mid-december and mid-january , there were 11,203 occasions across @entity16 – more than 350 a day – in which ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because @entity55 were full			1
casualties are often crammed because patients can not be shifted elsewhere in the hospital due to lack of beds – a situation called ‘ exit block ’			2
studies show that when a&es are crowded , patients fare worse and death rates can rise			2
dr @entity42 said : ‘ boarding spreads the risk across the whole hospital , rather than concentrating and multiplying it in the emergency department			2
’ he admitted it was ‘ potentially toxic and divisive ’ but said an ‘ exceptional response ’ was needed to ‘ exceptional circumstances ’			0
dr @entity42 said that ‘ a handful ’ of hospitals now use boarding during busy periods , but he would not name them			2
a spokesman for @entity81 ’s said they did not use the practice			0
dr @entity42 was speaking at a conference organised by the @entity32 , which is advocating greater use of boarding			1
with hospitals – and @entity55 in particular – getting busier every year , he said action had to be taken to better manage the rising flow of patients			0
‘ if we get a trend like this going on into next winter , it ’s going to be like @entity95 , ’ he warned			0
on 11,203 occasions across @entity16 – more than 350 a day – ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because @entity55 were full emergency doctors also see boarding as a way of making their hospital colleagues realise the problems they are facing			1
dr @entity105 , an @entity9 consultant at @entity106 in @entity107 , said : ‘ it is not acceptable to have people waiting in the emergency department , out of sight of the rest of the hospital			0
’ but many medics have serious reservations			0
dr @entity116 , clinical director of @entity118 , said there was ‘ pretty much no evidence ’ that boarding was safe in @entity41 hospitals			0
he said : ‘ for a royal college to advocate this is fairly hazardous , without the evidence base to support it			0
’ the @entity126 has been campaigning for almost three years to stop the closure of @entity9 units .			0
