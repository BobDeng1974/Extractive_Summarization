it 's a revival of a period drama classic , so the seven million viewers who tune in to @entity6 ’s new hit @entity2 would be forgiven for thinking they had seen some of the characters before			1
but , as these pictures show , it ’s not just the 1970s original that the new cast bear uncanny similarities to ... @entity2 's first love @entity15 , as played by @entity16 , shares the cool beauty and brunette tresses of @entity21 host @entity20 , the fiancee of footballer @entity22			2
@entity23 , which @entity20 used to present , just became @entity24 ... doubles : @entity26 , left , who plays @entity2 's first love @entity15 , has stunning similarities to @entity20 ( right ) handsome leading man @entity29 oozes the same rugged , brooding sex appeal of tragic @entity32 frontman @entity31 in his portrayal of captain @entity2			1
@entity2 - a - likes : he 's been turning heads as the new @entity35 and it 's easy to see why when he looks like tragic @entity32 frontman @entity31 the @entity39 rocker may have sung @entity40 … but in this case never tell us apart might be more accurate			1
he might not be known for having the voice of an angel , but actor @entity45 , who plays @entity46 , still resembles choirboy - turned - broadcaster @entity47			0
choirboy faces : @entity45 , who plays @entity46 ( right ) is the double of @entity47 just do n’t try to imagine him singing @entity50 in a dubious @entity52 accent ... @entity2 ’s drunken servant @entity53 and his buxom wife @entity54 have a couple of comedy doppelgangers			1
what a couple : @entity59 's servant and his wife look similar to a couple of other familiar characters ( below ) @entity63 , played by @entity64 and @entity65 , aka @entity66 , could be mistaken for @entity35 characters @entity68 and @entity69 ( above ) @entity71 ’s scoundrel resembles sitcom rag - and - bone man @entity63 ( @entity64 ) , and @entity65 looks like @entity73 star @entity66 as she appeared in @entity74			1
@entity65 is actually the daughter of another acting icon – @entity76			0
as volatile captain @entity78 , @entity77 is a million miles from laid - back charmer @entity79			2
but put them both in a waistcoat and cravat – as @entity79 wore on stage in @entity85 – and the similarities are more obvious			0
performers : not alike in character but captain @entity78 ot @entity77 and @entity90 are not too different in a waistcoat and cravat fiery , flame - haired and prone to scandalising polite society , @entity35 temptress @entity93 , @entity95 , bears more than a physical similarity to @entity98 , the showgirl at the centre of the 1963 @entity101 affair			0
red - haired beauties : @entity35 temptress @entity93 , @entity95 ( right ) looks much like @entity98 , the showgirl at the centre of the 1963 @entity101 affair it looks like @entity104 are actually two - a - penny , as @entity106 - who plays @entity107 , channels the spirit of @entity109 in the 1995 film version of @entity112 's @entity111			0
handsome hat - wearers @entity109 in the 1995 film version of @entity112 's @entity111 looks like @entity106 , who plays @entity107 in the drama in his last screen role , late acting heavyweight @entity116 is positively churchillian as the imposing patriarch @entity117 ... though sadly it 's the animated insurance - selling dog he resembles rather than @entity120 's greatest prime minister			2
oh , no ? oh , yes ... oh yes : late actor @entity116 has a barking similarity to the @entity122 the cartoon dog			0

stars from the new hit drama look like other well - known characters
drunken servant is the spit of @entity63 from the @entity120 sitcom
captain @entity2 is *spookily* like a late @entity39 rocker
