a pedestrian who was hit by a cyclist died from a massive blood clot six days after doctors failed to spot a badly injured artery in his neck , an inquest has heard			2
@entity7 , 58 , from @entity8 , was walking along @entity9 in @entity10 when he was hit by a cyclist on july 25 last year			1
both the married father - of - two and the cyclist appeared unharmed at the time and spoke together before parting ways			1
mr @entity7 was taken to @entity15 in @entity16 three days after he was hit in @entity10 mr @entity7 was taken by ambulance to @entity15 in @entity18 three days later with blurred vision , dizziness and a headache and given a ct scan			1
dr @entity23 , a consultant radiologist , who is being represented during the inquest along with @entity25 where the mr @entity7 died , was responsible for reporting on the scan 's results			1
he told the court : ' i was looking out for previous injury and with his history of the accident three days before , i was looking for what you would expect from a head injury			0
' he had slurred speech and dizziness so the most likely cause was a head injury , that was what i was treating this as			0
' expert witness , neurosurgeon dr @entity42 , told @entity43 earlier that a ' trained radiologist ' should have noticed in the @entity45 scan that mr @entity7 had suffered from a dissected artery in his neck which was causing blood clots to the brain			1
dr @entity23 , who was looking at the scan from his computer at home , said the software did not have a ' stroke setting ' at the time , which contributed to him not diagnosing the problem			1
bike accident : @entity7 , 58 , was walking down @entity9 in @entity10 when he was hit ' after reviewing the images later , i saw what i could have done to deduce this and ordered a stroke setting to be put on my computer , ' he said			1
a consultant in the @entity66 department , dr @entity67 , said mr @entity7 had not shown ' clinical signs of a stroke ' when he arrived at hospital on july 28 last year three days after the collision			1
' it was noted his blurred vision had started that day at lunch time and that he had had been in a bike collision , ' he said			0
' however , he did not have symptoms of the accident and his ct scan was reported as normal			0
' mr @entity7 was discharged in the early hours of july 29 but was rushed back by ambulance that afternoon with paramedics suspecting a stroke			2
' i do not think the incident with the collision led to the underlying causes of mr @entity7 ' death ' dr @entity67 , @entity66 department ' he was seen immediately by the stroke team and sent for another ct scan , ' he said			2
' contrary to the radiologist report , there were signs of a stroke and the second scan showed a dissection of his artery at the base of his neck , causing a blockage			0
' mr @entity7 was taken to @entity25 hours later where he went through a decompression surgery the next day to reduce swelling of his brain			0
' however , his consciousness level decreased and on august 3 , he died as a result of the major stroke , ' he said			1
' the ct scan would have shown possibilities of a stroke and had it given that information , mr @entity7 would have been referred to the stroke team immediately			2
' although dr @entity67 said the dissection of the artery could happen ' any time ' after an accident , the longer the delay ' the less likely the accident caused the dissection '			0
' the collision with the bicycle may have caused the dissection but it might not have caused it at all			0
' i do not think the incident with the collision led to the underlying causes of mr @entity7 ' death			0
' earlier dr @entity42 said the dissection could have been caused by the patient 's hypertension and high cholesterol , two long term factors which can lead to the condition			0
