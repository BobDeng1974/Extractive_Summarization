until now , it has been a hidden world , protected by hundreds of feet of freezing water and 20 metres of ice			2
now , researchers have created a special robo - explorer to borrow into the ice and record the first footage of what lies on the seabed below the @entity9			1
the icefin was deployed ( and retrieved ) the vehicle through a 12 - inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor			1
a first - of - its - kind robotic vehicle recently dove to depths never before visited under @entity24 's @entity9 and brought back video of life on the seafloor			1
' we built a vehicle that 's a hybrid between the really small probes and the ocean - going vessels , and we can deploy it through bore holes on @entity24 , ' said @entity34 , an assistant professor in the @entity36 at the @entity37 , and the principle investigator for the @entity40 project			1
the technologies developed for @entity40 will also help in the search for life on other planets , namely @entity45 , a moon of @entity47			1
@entity24 's icy oceans are remarkably similar to @entity50 - capped oceans			2
' at the same time , we 're advancing hypotheses that we need for @entity45 and understanding ocean systems here better			1
' we 're also developing and getting comfortable with technologies that make polar science -- and eventually @entity45 science - more realistic			1
' the robotic vehicle carried a scientific payload capable of measuring ocean conditions under the ice			1
@entity40 's readings of the environment under @entity24 's ice shelves , and video of the life that thrives in these harsh conditions , will help understand how @entity24 's ice shelves are changing under warming conditions , and to understand how organisms thrive in cold and light - free environments			1
the icefin was deployed ( and retrieved ) the vehicle through a 12 - inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor			1
a team of scientists and engineers from the @entity37 assembled the unmanned , underwater vehicle on @entity24			2
@entity40 was deployed as a part of the @entity81 and @entity82 ( @entity84 ) program , funded by @entity85 and supported by @entity86 , with @entity34 as the principle investigator			2
the research team returned from @entity24 in december 2014			2
@entity40 is planned to make its @entity91 debut in summer 2016 , with a return to @entity24 that fall , the team hopes at @entity93 , @entity34 and a team including @entity37 scientists and engineers from the @entity97 ( @entity97 ) , led by principal research engineer @entity98 , deployed @entity99 to explore the underside of the ice shelves flowing off the continent			2
' what truly separates @entity99 from some of the other vehicles is that it 's fairly slender , yet still has all of the sensors that the scientists like @entity34 need , ' @entity98 said			2
the icefin was deployed ( and retrieved ) the vehicle through a 12 - inch diameter hole through 20 meters of ice ( pictured ) and another 500 meters of water to the sea floor			1
' our vehicle has instrumentation aboard both for navigation and ocean science that other vehicles do not			1
' the @entity122 can be as deep as 5,000 meters			0
@entity40 is capable of diving 1,500 meters and can perform three - kilometer - long surveys			0
previous vehicles in @entity40 's class were rated to a few hundred meters			0
' we saw evidence of a complex community on the sea floor that has never been observed before , and unprecedented detail on the ice - ocean interface that has n't been achieved before , ' @entity34 said			1
video captured by @entity40 shows eerie footage of an active seafloor 500 meters under the @entity9			1
' biologists at @entity93 were just amazed at the amount of biology at that location which included sea stars , sponges and anemones that were at the ocean bottom , ' @entity98 said			1
' to have our very first deep - ocean dive happen through a small hole in the ice and go all the way to the ocean bottom and get the video we did was pretty amazing			1
' a partnership between research - focused @entity97 and academic - focused school of @entity151 and @entity152 ( @entity150 ) enabled the team to design , build and deploy @entity40 under the ice in less than a @entity156 design cycles for these types of vehicles typically are two to three years			0
the team had to design for a number of challenges associated with deploying @entity40 in such an extreme environment			0
for example , standard electronics systems are not typically rated to the extreme temperatures found under the @entity9			0
@entity40 carries forward and up / down imaging and sonars and several different sensors			0
@entity40 is also modular , similar to vehicles used on space missions			0
scientists can swap sensors or point them in different directions as needed			0
@entity98 poses with @entity40 , the robotic underwater vehicle built by @entity97 and @entity37 traditional gps does not work under the ice , so @entity40 uses a navigation system called @entity179 ( simultaneous localization and mapping ) to triangulate its position based on measuring the range and bearing of features on the seafloor or under the ice			0
traditional underwater vehicles deployed on @entity24 are either ' roving eyes ' because they carry only a camera , or much larger vehicles that are deployed in the water on the edge of the ice shelf			0
@entity40 fills the gap between these two kinds of vehicles : able to be deployed easily by small teams in any environment , yet still able to record oceanographic information traditionally done by much larger vehicles			0
' we had probably 100 contingencies for if something went wrong , ' @entity98 said			0
' through lots of analysis and robust design , we were fortunate not to have to initiate any of them			0
' once @entity40 was assembled , the vehicle was deployed through a bore hole in the ice that was 12 inches in diameter and 20 meters deep			0
bore holes are often drilled on @entity24 for ocean moorings and sediment sampling			1
traditional gps does not work under the ice , so @entity40 uses a navigation system called @entity179 ( simultaneous localization and mapping ) to triangulate its position based on measuring the range and bearing of features on the seafloor or under the ice			0
' using algorithms such as @entity179 allows us to construct a map of the unknown under - ice environment			0
' when you can do that , you can begin to get a 3d picture of what 's going on under the water , ' @entity98 said			0
massive icebergs clog @entity237 after breaking off from the @entity9 in @entity24 , october 2003			0
the sensors on @entity40 are helping scientists understand how the ocean affects properties of the ice , and how the ice affects properties of the ocean			2
the exchange between ocean and ice is a process that mediates biology , affects the climate system and controls the stability of glaciers			2
' those are important processes that we can work out here in our backyard at the same time as we 're answering how an ice shell would reflect the ocean chemistry on @entity45 , ' @entity34 said			1
' the ice shell is built out of the ocean , but how that process works is not well understood			2

footage reveals huge variety of life on the seabed
sea stars , sponges and anemones can be seen at the ocean bottom
@entity273 could help in the search for life on @entity45 , a moon of @entity47
