by @entity0 an international team of astronomers has discovered a large planet floating freely through space with no star to orbit			1
planets traditionally travel in a uniform , singular direction , around a star			2
however , the free - floating planet , named @entity11 , has been found without a host			1
its movement is n't structured , scientists do not understand how it formed and they are baffled by what - if anything - controls it			2
artist 's impression of free - floating planet @entity11			1
the planet does n't appear to have a host star and scientists from @entity27 's @entity26 are n't sure how it formed			1
it is believed to be around 12 million years old , and is considered a newborn in planet terms orbits are created by a balance between the forward motion of a body in space , such as a planet or moon , and the pull of gravity on it from another body , such as a large planet or star			1
an object with a large mass goes forward and wants to keep going forward ; however , the gravity of another body in space pulls it in			0
there is a continuous tug - of - war between the one object wanting to go forward and away and the other wanting to pull it in			0
these forces of inertia and gravity create the orbit			0
if the movement of one object is too strong , the object speeds past the other and does n't enter orbit			0
if the movement is weaker than the pull of gravity , the object will be pulled into the other one and crash			0
when a planet does n't have a star , in theory , it should carry on moving and not remain still because there are no forces in place keeping it there			2
@entity11 appears to be staying relatively still but does n't have a host star to keep it in place			1
@entity11 was detected 80 lightyears away from @entity82 and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of @entity85			1
astronomers believe it formed 12 million years ago , and is considered a newborn in planetary terms - @entity82 is thought to be around 4.5 billion years old			1
dr @entity90 of the @entity91 at the @entity92 identified the rogue planet from its ' faint and unique heat signature '			0
he used the @entity96 1 ( @entity96 ) wide - field survey telescope on @entity97 , @entity98 to make the discovery , before following it up using other telescopes across @entity102 to validate his claims and make sure the find was n't a fluke			2
these follow - up observations found that @entity11 has all the same properties of other gas - giant planets found orbiting around young stars - yet @entity11 is all by itself			1
' we have never before seen an object free - floating in space that that looks like this			2
' it has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars , but it is drifting out there all alone , ' explained @entity90			1
' i had often wondered if such solitary objects exist , and now we know they do			0
' extrasolar planets , or planets found outside the solar system , have been discovered at various points over the past decade			1
around a thousand of these were found when their host stars began wobbling or dimming because of the pull of the planet			1
however , only a small amount of these planets have been directly imaged , all of which are around young stars less than 200 million years old			1
astronomer dr. @entity90 used the @entity96 1 wide - field telescope on @entity98 to make the discovery			0
@entity11 , pictured , was discovered during a search for failed stars known as brown dwarfs			2
brown dwarfs are faint and are red in colour			0
@entity11 stood out because it was ' redder than even the reddest known brown dwarfs ' @entity11 is one of the lowest - mass free - floating objects known , perhaps the very lowest , according to @entity90			1
but its most unique aspect is its similar mass , colour , and energy output to these directly imaged planets			2
' planets found by direct imaging are incredibly hard to study , since they are right next to their much brighter host stars			1
' @entity11 is not orbiting a star so it will be much easier for us to study			1
it is going to provide a wonderful view into the inner workings of gas - giant planets like @entity85 shortly after their birth , ' said dr. @entity166 of the @entity167 in @entity168			1
based on its distance and motion through space , the team concluded that @entity11 , shown in red , belongs to a collection of young stars called the @entity176 moving group @entity11 was discovered during a search for the failed stars known as brown dwarfs			1
due to their relatively cool temperatures , brown dwarfs are very faint and are red in colour			0
@entity90 and his colleagues have been mining the data from the @entity96 telescope for many years			0
@entity96 scans the sky every night with a camera sensitive enough to detect the faint heat signatures of brown dwarfs			0
@entity11 stood out because it was ' redder than even the reddest known brown dwarfs			2
' infrared spectra taken with the @entity194 and the @entity195 showed that @entity11 was not a brown dwarf , based on signatures in its infrared light that are best explained by it being young and low - mass. ' we often describe looking for rare celestial objects as akin to searching for a needle in a haystack			1
so we decided to search the biggest haystack that exists in astronomy , the dataset from @entity96 , ' said dr. @entity209 of the @entity91 at the @entity92 at @entity210			0
dr. @entity209 leads the data processing team for @entity96 , which produces the equivalent of 60,000 photos every night			0
astronomers from @entity216 and @entity217 believe orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny , cold dust clouds in space			0
research has shown there could be as many as 200 billion ' free - floating ' planets in our galaxy alone			2
until now it was assumed that such ' rogue planets ' must have been ejected from their solar systems			0
but new observations point to the likelihood of some free - floating worlds forming on their own			0
astronomers used several telescopes to observe the @entity234 , a huge cloud of gas and dust 4,600 light years from @entity82 in the constellation of @entity238 , the @entity238			1
the nebula is home to more than 100 of the unusual planet - forming clouds , dubbed ' globulettes '			0
each has a diameter less than 50 times the distance between the @entity247 and the planet @entity249			0
dr @entity250 , from @entity251 in @entity252 , @entity216 , said : ' we found that the globulettes are very dense and compact , and many of them have very dense cores			0
' that tells us that many of them will collapse under their own weight and form free - floating planets			2
the most massive of them can form so - called brown dwarfs			0
' the scientists believe countless millions of nebulae such as the @entity234 have bloomed and faded away during the @entity268 â€™s long history			0
many could have given birth to free - floating planets			2
the total dataset to date is about 4,000 terabytes , bigger than the sum of the digital version of all the movies ever made , all books ever published , and all the music albums ever released			0
by regularly monitoring the position of @entity278 - 22 over two years with the @entity279 , the team directly measured its distance from @entity82			2
based on this distance and its motion through space , the team concluded that @entity11 belongs to a collection of young stars called the @entity176 moving group that formed about 12 million years ago			1
the eponymous star of the group , @entity176 , has a young gas - giant planet in orbit around it , yet @entity11 is even lower in mass than the @entity176 planet and ' probably formed in a different fashion			1

floating planet @entity11 - *22found* by @entity102 's @entity26
the planet is 80 lightyears from @entity82 and formed 12 million years ago
it is similar to other gas - giant planets found orbiting young stars
yet , @entity306 does not have a host star and is ' drifting on its own '
