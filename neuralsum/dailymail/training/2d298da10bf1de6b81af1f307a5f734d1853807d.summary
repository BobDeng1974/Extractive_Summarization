by @entity0 last updated at 3:36 pm on 17th november 2011 surreal : winemaker @entity6 , 45 , at his vineyard in @entity4 , @entity5 , was tasered by blundering police officers a winemaker on his way home from harvesting grapes was tasered by blundering police in a bizarre mix up over a burning car			1
@entity6 had driven past a burning car when police suddenly smashed his van window with a baton and fired the electrical stun device at his shoulder			1
the shocked 45 - year - old vintner was still reeling from the blow when he was taken to a police station in @entity4 , @entity5			0
he was breath tested but charged with failing to stop when asked and the matter ended up in court a year on			2
but at the start of the trial no evidence was offered and the court case was dropped			1
mr @entity6 , from the well known @entity29 in @entity4 , maintained all along he had done nothing wrong and did not see officers signalling for him to stop as he passed a burning car			1
after the case was dismissed , he said the incident was ' one of the most surreal moments in my life '			2
he said : ' from my point of view it all happened over a year ago but has been hanging over me since			0
i just want to get on with my work			0
' the incident began in the early hours of one october morning last year when he was driving with two passengers down a local road where they encountered a burning car			2
explanations : police said they were ' in a heightened state of alert ' when they tasered @entity6 he had been harvesting the @entity51 grapes and was on his way home			1
' i reversed back and there was an officer hiding in a hedge who came out , smashed the side window and fired the @entity59			0
' he claimed the officers then asked him what it felt like to be tasered , replying that it was like erecting an electric badger fence			0
he said : ' they thought i was connected to the burned out car			0
' prosecutor @entity69 told magistrates at @entity71 , @entity5 , before the trial : ' the prosecution decision is to offer no evidence and we would like the case to be dismissed			0
' in hiding : police were behind a hedge in @entity4 ( pictured ) when @entity6 drove past @entity5 and @entity80 police said officers had been investigating an incident when a car hit a house and burst into flames			1
they had been on the look out for culprits and were ' in a heightened state of alert '			1
the dispute was about whether mr @entity6 had failed to stop when signalled to do so			2
his solicitor @entity90 made a request for defence costs to be paid .			0

police said @entity6 failed to stop when asked as he drove past burning car
' surreal ' court case against winemaker dropped as trial *due* to start
