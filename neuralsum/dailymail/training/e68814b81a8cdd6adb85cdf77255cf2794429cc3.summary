he is also responsible for recruiting fellow foreign fighters			1
@entity5 was never able to capture @entity18 , but much of the population , like that in @entity32 , which had a large @entity3 community , has also been forced to flee			2
speaking from the @entity3 stronghold in the @entity20 city of @entity36 , he said : ' one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter			0
but here we 're actually fighting for the freedom of the people here to be able live peaceably , to be able to live without persecution , to keep the church bells ringing			0
' the mass exodus that took place in mid- 2014 has put the continued existence of one of world 's oldest @entity3 communities into question			0
with @entity20 peshmerga fighters now clawing back land around @entity32 , some @entity54 are keen to take up arms for their survival and @entity59 is only one of several recently formed groups			1
thousands of westerners have been recruited into the ranks of @entity5 , but many of those end up as ' cannon fodder ' or suicide bombers to assist more valuable @entity68 fighters			2
in his first week with responsibility for recruiting foreign fighters , he has identified five volunteers from the @entity1 , @entity72 and @entity73			1
each of the five men has previous military experience or worked as private military contractors			0

as early as october 2014 , he began saving money to join the fight against @entity5			2
@entity96 says he travelled to @entity4 to continue defending his country , even though @entity3 - with barely a few hundred fighters in its ranks - sees little frontline action			2
he said : ' i 'm patriotic as hell			0
if my government wo n't fight them i will			0
' the growing contingent of foreign recruits have a variety of reasons for joining @entity3			0
@entity115 , an older man from @entity116 , @entity73 , came because he heard about ' slaughterhouses ' where @entity5 allegedly cuts people up for organ trafficking			0

other foreigners in @entity3 say they were turned off by what they see as the socialist streak in the @entity149 , an affiliate of @entity157 's @entity156 whose months - long battle against @entity5 in @entity159 attracted many volunteers			2
thousands of @entity54 were forced to flee their homes after @entity5 threatened to approach @entity162 , a prominent @entity72 foreign fighter and veteran of the @entity164 , recently left the @entity149 for similar reasons			1
he told @entity166 that an exodus of foreign fighters from the @entity149 has begun , naming several well - known volunteers currently fighting for the group he says plan to leave in the coming days			1
@entity172 , a former @entity1 soldier who has become the poster boy of @entity149 foreign fighters , argued that some volunteers may have lost their bottle when confronted with the intensity of the fighting in @entity159			1
' most of the @entity179 cowboys have come to realise this is n't a normal deployment			0
so they lose the stomach to come or stay			0
' @entity184 admitted that he had been diagnosed with @entity185 by naval medics @entity0 , right , said that he wants to protect @entity4 's ancient @entity3 community and allow them to live in peace			1
