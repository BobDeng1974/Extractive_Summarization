by @entity0 and @entity1 too much : @entity2 got caught up in a ' hedonistic ' party lifestyle in @entity4 police and a coroner have been accused of serious failings in their investigations into the death of a teenage boy allegedly groomed by a tv star			1
@entity12 was found dead in hospital after telling medical staff he had been raped by the celebrity , whose identity was covered up at the inquest into @entity2 ’s death			1
now it can be revealed that the nurse who discovered his secret torment was never asked to give evidence to the jury , even though the fashion student ’s family were desperate to hear from him			2
the nurse says @entity2 told him he was raped by the comedian , and believed he was plied with drink and drugs to ensure he gave his ‘ consent ’ for sex			1
although @entity33 claims to have carried out a full investigation , detectives did not even manage to access the tragic 18 - year - old ’s phone to look for text messages he received from his alleged abuser			2
the tv comic himself was never questioned by police or the coroner and , when asked about his former friend this week , replied : ‘ who ’s @entity12 ? ’ last night there were calls for the @entity47 to reopen its investigation into the sexual assaults allegedly suffered by @entity50 - born @entity2 during the year he spent caught up in a ‘ hedonistic lifestyle ’ in @entity4			1
an online petition has been launched calling on the @entity47 to ‘ investigate fully all the allegations ’ , and ‘ at least interview ’ the celebrity			2
critics said coroner @entity57 should explain why she failed to approach key witnesses and why she agreed that the comic should only be called ‘ mr @entity60 ’			1
a friend of @entity2 said : ‘ we ’re very concerned that key witnesses were not contacted , and the police did n’t do a very good job			1
’ the court heard how @entity2 was ‘ groomed ’ by the comedian after moving from @entity67 to study at the @entity68 in september 2009 , aged 17			1
in july 2010 the comedian and @entity2 fell out and the teenager ’s mental health quickly deteriorated			1
he returned to @entity67 but made a series of apparent suicide attempts and was admitted to @entity74 , a nearby mental health centre			0
a family 's anguish : @entity2 's sister @entity78 , 25 , could not hide her emotions outside the inquest in @entity67 , @entity50 there he gradually revealed how the celebrity took him to drug - fuelled parties , leaving him feeling ‘ dirty and used ’			1
on one occasion , he said , the older man climbed uninvited into his bed , engaging him in a sex act			0
another time @entity2 said he was persuaded to strip by a group of men and publicly fondled			1
@entity2 was found dead in his room beside a plastic bag in december 2010			1
but after the eight - day hearing ended last wednesday with an open verdict , @entity2 ’s mother said the family had been ‘ failed by the inquest process ’ and suffered a ‘ tragic injustice ’			2
in a joint statement with the rest of her family , mrs @entity99 , 52 , highlighted how ‘ key members of @entity2 ’s care team … were not available ’ to the inquest			2
emotional : @entity99 , @entity2 's sister , arrives at the inquest into the tragic death of her brother they had asked to hear from a nurse whom @entity2 told about the alleged rape			1
however @entity112 was never called to give evidence			0
family solicitor @entity114 said : ‘ he was one of the staff @entity2 felt he could talk to			2
we requested he attend the inquest but were told he was in @entity118 so could n’t be called			0
’ the nurse was stunned to be told by this newspaper that he had been deemed ‘ unavailable ’			0
mr @entity112 , a 35 - year - old former soldier , said he ‘ found it really , really surprising ’ not to be called , adding : ‘ @entity2 told me he was raped in @entity4			1
all the stuff that was going on in his head – he was taken advantage of			0
’ he added : ‘ you ’ve got to take what he says until you can actually find out the truth			0
it ’s a grey area in mental health , but for someone to go the way he did there has got to be some truth in what ’s gone on			0
’ told that the @entity47 said there was no conclusive evidence of sexual assault he replied : ‘ why did n’t they go and look for it then ? ’ the @entity142 ’s @entity141 told the inquest how @entity2 revealed his torment in a one - to - one conversation with mr @entity112 in which the nurse ‘ was quite sure the word rape was used ’			1
@entity2 had already described other traumatic sexual incidents involving the older comedian and his friends			2
but this was the only time he spoke of a criminal offence			0
detectives found some @entity155 messages between the pair and decided they were friendly , but could not crack the security features on @entity2 ’s @entity142 said : ‘ following an assessment of the available material no criminal offences were disclosed			1
’ by @entity161 and @entity162 the celebrity accused of grooming @entity12 has denied knowing the teenager			1
the gay comedian dedicated a gig to the 18 - year - old after his death in 2010			0
but when asked by the @entity170 about his former friend this week , the tv star replied : ‘ who ’s @entity12 ? ’ when he was reminded that he had previously paid tribute to @entity2 , the comic said : ‘ i do n’t remember			1
’ the star – referred to only as ‘ mr x ’ at @entity2 ’s inquest – then refused to answer any further questions			2
standing united : @entity179 , @entity2 's mother , reads a statement following the conclusion of the hearing when told that @entity2 ’s twin sister @entity183 had spoken of concerns that her brother had been ‘ groomed ’ by the comedian in @entity4 , he replied : ‘ i have nothing to say			1
’ the comedian was approached again by this newspaper after the conclusion of the inquest in @entity67 , @entity50			0
he refused to answer any questions , and walked away			0
the comic has , however , made a series of angry comments on the internet about the allegations surrounding him			0
these can not be reported for legal reasons , after coroner dr @entity57 unusually granted him anonymity at @entity2 ’s inquest			1
at a pre-inquest hearing attended by lawyers for @entity2 ’s family and the hospital where he died , the coroner decided that the older man should only be referred to as ‘ x ’			1
sources say it was because he was not a witness and had not been interviewed by the police			0
the media were not told about this hearing in advance and the coroner did not make a formal order banning the reporting of the name			2
media law expert @entity218 said of the decision : ‘ i ’ve never seen anything like it myself			0
i ca n’t see that it was entirely successful or satisfactory for any party			0
’ the name of the gay comedian was not mentioned during the inquest at @entity228 in @entity67 , @entity50 , last week @entity230 mp @entity229 said : ‘ this case worries me			0
secrecy does not seem to be justified , but is enforced by the judicial system			0
’ under the @entity236 , judges and coroners can keep the identities of individuals secret , but only if they would refuse to give evidence otherwise , or if naming them would not be in the interests of justice			0
even police officers involved in highly sensitive shootings have been named in inquests after challenges to anonymity orders			0
after last week ’s @entity170 revealed details of the comedian ’s relationship with @entity2 , he hired a prominent legal firm to ensure his name remained secret			2
the internet remains awash with speculation over his identity , but his solicitors have threatened to sue any newspaper which unmasks him .			0
