a @entity1 programme featuring ' dynamite ' interview tapes with princess @entity4 was axed amid fears it would upset the royal family , it is claimed the @entity1 allegedly wasted £ 500,000 on a documentary featuring ' dynamite ' interviews with princess @entity4 - but later shelved it because it did not want to upset the monarchy , it has been claimed			1
according to the director behind a controversial documentary about the @entity4 , the @entity1 went on to give a misleading account of why the programme was not broadcast			1
@entity17 said at the time that @entity4 : her story , her words , due to be broadcast on the tenth anniversary of her death , did not sufficiently add to the story of @entity4 's life			1
but , in another controversial documentary being aired tonight , it is claimed the @entity1 stopped its broadcast amid fears it would upset the @entity31 close to @entity34 's @entity33 60th birthday			1
the extraordinary claims are featured in reinventing the @entity36 , which hit the headlines late last year after @entity38 allegedly tried to stop the programme being broadcast - a claim it vehemently denies			0
@entity4 : her story , her words , made by award - winning director @entity43 , had included extracts from video tapes of the princess , taped in 1992 and 1993			1
the tapes have been broadcast only once – on @entity50 television network @entity49 , in 2004			0
such was the controversy caused by their screening that the tapes were not sold to other broadcasters			0
but , three years later , the @entity1 spent more than £ 30,000 buying an option to broadcast three minutes of the tapes for the programme			1
the documentary was later axed , with the @entity1 claiming it did not ' add ' to @entity4 's story - despite having spent hundreds of thousands on its production			1
but , in reinventing the @entity36 , mr @entity43 apparently casts down on why the @entity1 stopped the recordings being aired			1
according to the @entity64 , he tells the programme : ' we had a considerable amount of taped interviews with @entity4 - in terms of giving you the key to @entity4 the woman , these were dynamite			0
' he adds : ' we were told , " well , it 's quite difficult – prince @entity33 is 60 and we 've got exclusive access to him , with @entity33 , and we do n't really want to offend him at this juncture			1
we would n't want to do anything at all , for example , that would mean he would pull out of the film "			0
' the tapes were compiled by @entity4 's voice coach @entity82 , an @entity50 actor now based in @entity83 , over several sessions			1
@entity4 , shy by nature , employed him to help her practise public speaking as she became increasingly independent of prince @entity33			1
@entity82 recorded 16 tapes during his coaching sessions with princess @entity4 at @entity98 she talked frankly about her relationship with the prince , his affair with @entity102 and her love for her bodyguard , @entity104 , and her suspicions that he had been murdered after he died in a traffic accident			1
mr @entity82 recorded 16 tapes during his coaching sessions at @entity98			2
seven of the so - called ‘ dynamite diaries ’ were discovered in 2001 when detectives raided the house of @entity4 ’s former butler , @entity112			0
mr @entity82 fought a long legal battle with her estate for control of the tapes , which he then sold to @entity49 for an undisclosed sum			2
after purchasing the tapes , the @entity1 commissioned mr @entity43 to oversee the film			2
the highly - regarded director has won a @entity121 for a @entity123 programme on the @entity124 , while his examination of @entity126 , titled @entity127 , and his film on the @entity129 , @entity130 , were both highly praised			0
@entity17 had planned to show the programme in august 2007 , with the authentic voice of @entity4 as the key selling point , to stand it apart from other films being made to mark the anniversary			1
but , shortly beforehand , the @entity1 decided to axe the show , claiming it added nothing to @entity4 's story			1
according to mr @entity43 , the @entity1 had at the time obtained exclusive access to prince @entity33 for a film marking his 60th birthday and feared upsetting the @entity98			1
a @entity1 spokeswoman said the decision - makers no longer worked at the @entity1 and it was therefore ' difficult to comment further			0
' the comments are made as part of reinventing the @entity36 , a two - part documentary presented by @entity147 ( centre ) and which attracted controversy before it was aired due to an alleged row over footage controversial : @entity152 was editor of @entity153 when it broadcast the infamous 1995 princess @entity4 interview reinventing the @entity36 , a two - part series written and presented by @entity153 journalist @entity147 , aired last week			2
the series opened with the death of princess @entity4 in 1997 , with the first episode focusing on the brickbats hurled at @entity33 in its wake			2
with his personal popularity in the doldrums , @entity33 asked @entity166 guru @entity165 , who was hired in 1996 , to give his public image a makeover and integrate @entity102 into palace life			2
dubbed ' @entity171 ' , the campaign is the source of one of the most embarrassing allegations aired in the programme - namely that @entity165 leaked news of prince @entity178 's first meeting with @entity102 to the media			2
@entity165 has denied this incident ever happened , but the @entity181 was reportedly left angry and upset by the leak and is said to have nicknamed the pr supremo ' @entity183 '			0
but the contents of the documentary was overshadowed by the controversy over the programme itself			0
campaign : much of the controversy focuses on @entity165 ( left ) and @entity191 ( right ) also features the programme was initially delayed , allegedly due to a dispute over footage			0
@entity38 denied it had tried to interfere , saying : ' the original broadcast of the programme was delayed by mutual agreement ( @entity1 and @entity38 ) whilst permissions were sought			0
' all permissions were subsequently granted			0
we have not seen the programme yet and have no comment to make			0
' nevertheless , the ensuing row reportedly left prince @entity33 ' furious ' - all the more so when lurid claims of spats between the @entity207 and @entity38 press teams emerged			1
meanwhile , the @entity1 had said the documentary was always going to be aired			2
a spokesman had said : ' before @entity210 it became clear that there were issues relating to the clearance of archive footage in the forthcoming programme reinventing the @entity36			0
' these issues have now been resolved and all the archive material we planned to use is included in the finished programme			0
' the first episode of reinventing the @entity36 will be broadcast on 19 february and it will be the one that we always intended to show			0
' princess @entity4 , the first wife of prince @entity33 , was killed in a horrific car crash in the @entity223 tunnel in @entity224 in august 1997			1
at the time , the @entity225 faced criticism for failing to capture the mood of the grieving nation			0
public anger began after the @entity225 took prince @entity178 and prince @entity230 to church at @entity232 , just a few hours after prince @entity33 had broken the news to them of their mother 's death			1
there were also accusations that the @entity225 remained in @entity240 for too long , and did not return quickly enough to @entity241 , where thousands had gathered in united grief over the @entity4 's death			2
compounding the @entity225 ’s absence was the lack of any flag flying at half - mast above @entity207 as a sign of royal mourning .			0

she talked about her *divorce* , @entity102 and her bodyguard
