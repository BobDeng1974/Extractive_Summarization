by @entity0 a @entity2 man says he has not paid a toll since the government switched to an electronic - only payment system on toll roads , no longer providing an option for motorists to pay cash			1
@entity10 , 68 , a former councillor from @entity11 says it is his ' constitutional right ' to pay by cash and that @entity14 should provide an option for people to pay tolls using coins			1
mr @entity10 , who frequently drives across the @entity19 between @entity20 and @entity21 , said the first time he drove across the bridge after they removed the option for motorists to pay by cash he did not understand the e-toll system and thought @entity27 had removed the toll			1
@entity10 says he would be happy to pay tolls if he could pay them in cash the 68 - year - old says it is his constitutional right to pay via ' gold and silver coin ' and he does not understand the electronic payment system or feels safe sharing his credit card details over the phone or online ' i made sure i had plenty of change in my ash tray and i thought " oh hello , there 's no way i can pay this toll , there 's no baskets			1
" i was completely unaware of how to pay it , ' he told @entity49			0
a short time later he received a ' nasty bill in the mail ' , which demanded not only the $ 4 toll , but also a $ 7.71 administrative fee			0
mr @entity10 called up to complain and eventually paid the money , after deducting the cost of the phone call and postage – sending @entity14 a cheque for 17 cents			1
since then he has continued to refuse to pay tolls via electronic means , insisting he would pay in cash if someone would give him that option			1
' i 'm certainly not going to give them my credit card details over the phone or pay it online			0
blokes in my age group have been warned in the papers and warned all over the place not to give your credit card details to people			0
' so i wrote a handwritten , signed and dated letter explaining that i had the money in my hand but there was no way to pay for it – they could come out and collect it from me			0
' the @entity84 man has received numerous fines for failing to pay his tolls , each time he writes a handwritten letter in reply explaining his views mr @entity10 says he knows his legal rights so well because his father used to make him read the @entity93 constitution and quiz him on it mr @entity10 bases his views on this article from chapter five of the constitution mr @entity10 , who calls himself a ' bush lawyer ' said he was quizzed on the @entity99 by his father as a child and remembered a clause that , he believes , gives his position legal backing			1
' in chapter five , section 115 it says : " a state shall not coin money , nor make anything but gold and silver coin a legal tender in payments of debts			0
" ' they kept sending me notices and they got debt collectors onto me and stuff , eventually i said i 'm quite happy to go to court about this and i 'll just ask the magistrate what part of the constitution do n't these toll people understand and i 'll explain it to them			0
' in september 2012 after numerous letters and fines , some of which escalated to the @entity133 ( @entity133 ) , the @entity14 dropped their case against mr @entity10 for the fines , despite having listed a hearing date			2
mr @entity10 continued to receive and reply to fines until june last year when they stopped altogether , despite the fact he has travelled on the @entity19 toll road several times since then			2
@entity14 were unable to provide specific information relating to mr @entity10 's case due to privacy laws			2
but @entity14 ceo @entity144 told @entity49 : ' electronic tolling on the @entity14 network is a much safer and more efficient system as it keeps traffic flowing helping to reduce congestion			0
' he also added that tolls can be paid by cash at @entity153 in @entity154 and @entity155 , as well as at participating retail stores			1
a constitutional expert told @entity49 that @entity158 was instituted to stop states setting up their own currency and that courts regularly dismiss cases such as this one			0
mr @entity10 frequently drives across the @entity19 , pictured , between @entity20 and @entity21			2

@entity10 , 68 , has not paid tolls since e-toll systems were *introduced*
he claims it is his constitutional right to pay the tolls in cash
