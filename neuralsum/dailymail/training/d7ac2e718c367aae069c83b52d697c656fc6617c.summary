by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity3 ’s hopes of reforming @entity5 ’s relationship with @entity6 received a boost as the new president of the @entity9 came out in support of a clampdown on benefit tourism			1
@entity13 said he ‘ could not imagine ’ the @entity14 without @entity5 – and it would be a ‘ dark scenario ’ if we left			1
he described the @entity14 ’s free movement of labour rules as a ‘ barrier ’ to continued @entity21 membership , insisting it would be possible to ‘ reach an agreement ’ on change			1
mr @entity3 has pledged a referendum on whether @entity5 should stay in @entity32 , held in 2017 , after renegotiations with @entity6			2
reform of immigration laws to crack down on free movement is a key goal for the @entity38 , particularly the right of migrants to claim benefits here			0
the comments by mr @entity13 , the @entity42 prime minister , will give @entity43 greater optimism that they will achieve success			1
mr @entity3 hopes mr @entity13 will be able to act as a counterweight to the other powerful @entity14 figure , president of the @entity50 @entity49 , who is likely to seek to block reforms			1
a @entity43 spokesman said : ‘ we think it is important that we have got a partner in the presidency of the @entity9 who we can work with on reform			0
’ this is the number of immigrants hitting the @entity21 @entity42 has already been working with the @entity21 on deregulation to help business , expansion of the single market and the exploitation of cheaper energy such as shale gas			1
ex-tory mp @entity68 , who has defected to @entity70 , said he had no confidence in the prime minister ’s ability to persuade @entity6 to agree significant reform			1
but it is understood the @entity42 leader is ready to support a crackdown on ‘ benefit tourism ’ , such as supporting limits on welfare payments to migrant workers			2
mr @entity13 said he wanted to ‘ emphasise that the @entity14 , and me personally , will take on the concerns voiced by the @entity21 ’			1
‘ i am talking about the @entity21 because i am sure that the future of the @entity14 is not about making it smaller , about contraction , ’ he said			2
‘ no reasonable person can imagine the @entity14 without the @entity21			2
i can not imagine it myself			0
' i have talked about it with @entity3			2
' he put forward many proposals for reforms and i am sure with a reasonable framework of politicians we can reach an agreement			0
‘ we can strive to eliminate various barriers – freedom of movement of workers , for example			0
’ mr @entity13 added : ‘ we ’ll need solutions to the concerns of @entity5			2
' no one reasonable can envisage the dark scenario of an @entity14 without @entity5			0
' many of the suggestions put forward for @entity14 reform [ by mr @entity3 ] are sensible			0
we can work together to eliminate any welfare abuse by @entity14 migrants			0
’ mr @entity3 welcomed the comments , saying : ‘ i ’m delighted obviously with what @entity13 has said about the importance of reform in the @entity14 and addressing the concern that @entity5 has in the @entity14			1
' i look forward to working with him in the months and the years ahead			0
’ the prime minister ’s support for mr @entity13 ’s presidency is a significant departure from earlier this year when the two fell out after mr @entity3 singled out the £ 55million paid in child benefits to @entity42 immigrants			1
also appointed was new foreign policy chief , @entity120 ’s @entity119 , who will take over from @entity5 ’s @entity121			0
blocking plans : @entity123 is expected to block @entity3 's pitch for a renegotiation of power business executives claim @entity5 could still flourish as a trading superpower even in the event of an exit the prime minister ’s success in backing the right horse in mr @entity13 is in sharp contrast to his humiliating failure to block mr @entity49 as @entity50 president earlier this year			1
mr @entity49 is an arch federalist who is unlikely to be willing to support limits on the free movement of workers			0
@entity143 president @entity142 said ‘ @entity5 ’s place in the @entity151 ’ was one of three challenges facing mr @entity13 , along with the ‘ stagnating economy ’ and @entity148 ’s dispute with @entity149			0
@entity70 mep @entity152 said : ‘ @entity13 is a rabid @entity14 centraliser who wants to take more power away from national governments and hand it over to @entity6 … it is a scandal that @entity3 would back @entity42 ’s @entity13 for … president of the @entity9			1

@entity42 prime minister @entity13 has renewed optimism in @entity161
@entity3 hopes he can add weight to @entity21 's plea for reforms
comes after humiliating failure to block *election* of @entity123
