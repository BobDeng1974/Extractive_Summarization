by @entity0 follow @ @ @entity1 @entity2 has been in unusually talkative mood here in @entity5 , indicative perhaps of increased form and confidence			0
it was on @entity9 in the early hours of sunday morning , though , that the @entity11 winger hit the most pertinent note when he described tonight ’s meeting with @entity14 in @entity15 as a ‘ friendly ’			1
the quotation marks said everything about the way both teams will approach the @entity21 final in @entity22			2
a friendly it is not			0
up for it : @entity25 knows the importance of matches against @entity11 , whatever the competition incoming : @entity11 players trained at the @entity30 as they prepared for their biggest test of pre-season circuit training : @entity34 sits and watches on as his @entity11 players are put through their paces in @entity15 ahead of monday night 's @entity21 final against @entity14 tied up : @entity11 's goalkeepers @entity39 ( left ) , @entity40 ( middle ) and @entity42 take part in resistance training at the @entity30 in the @entity22 city warm - up : @entity47 , who has captained the side on two occasions during the tour , goes for a jog breather : @entity11 take a rest during the practice session as @entity55 ( left ) watches on main men : @entity57 ( left ) and @entity58 ( right ) are put through their paces in @entity15 in control : @entity61 holds off @entity62 as @entity14 train in @entity22 ahead of monday 's final feeling the heat : @entity65 takes a break as his @entity14 side prepare to face their rivals shock to the system : @entity11 were thrashed 3 - 0 by @entity14 last season and finished 20 points behind them big game : both clubs are expected to be a big pull in @entity5 , where pre-season is beginning to heat up when these two clubs meet it is never anything other than deadly serious and as such the game represents the start of the competitive @entity82 club season			1
forget sunday ’s @entity84 at @entity85 , it is here in @entity5 that the first markers of the season will be made			0
both @entity11 and @entity14 have things to prove this season and it begins in the early hours of tuesday morning			1
@entity91 chief executive @entity90 — architect of the doomed plan to play a 39th @entity91 game abroad every season — will perhaps close his eyes and wonder about what might have been			0
for the two teams involved though , the motivation will be rather more traditional , certainly more fundamental			0
something to shout about : @entity2 said on @entity9 that this game would be anything but friendly spot on : @entity47 said that ' when @entity11 play @entity14 , it is always a big deal ' slalom : @entity105 takes his turn on the cones as @entity11 continued their pre-season preparations with a round of circuit training @entity11 midfielder @entity47 said : ‘ it ’s @entity11 versus @entity14			1
i know it ’s only pre-season and it ’s just a summer competition , but when @entity11 play @entity14 , it is always a big deal			1
' we want to win every match and it is no different when we play @entity14			2
the main thing is winning games and getting that mentality back			0
’ @entity11 have more bad memories of last season than they know what to do with			1
a 3 - 0 home defeat to @entity14 in march stands out as one of the low points and a sea change in terms of the power balance between two great clubs			1
since then , though , @entity11 have hired a successful @entity131 manager and have breezed through pre-season games against @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135			2
they saw off @entity136 3 - 1 on saturday in front of 109,318 spectators at the @entity139 , with @entity2 scoring two and @entity141 adding the third			1
@entity14 have also enjoyed an encouraging pre-season and booked their place in tonight ’s final with a 2 - 0 win over @entity146 in @entity147 with goals from @entity149 and @entity150 , although the game was notable for @entity152 missing a penalty — having scored his 34 previous spot - kicks with @entity155			1
relaxed : @entity55 has made a real impression since joining @entity11 after the @entity131 bouncing back : @entity11 have been impressive in @entity5 with @entity2 in particular playing well the game throws up an intriguing clash between the two managers as @entity14 ’s @entity65 comes face to face with @entity11 ’s new boss @entity34 — the man he stopped from becoming a director of football at @entity162 two years ago			1
@entity55 had talks over a sporting - director role when @entity14 were looking for a new boss but when @entity65 was approached he insisted he would not work with someone in that position			2
when asked about whether it would add spice to the game , @entity65 insisted : ‘ it was obviously something before i came in and i was always going to work with a team of people rather than a director of football			0
‘ it will be a great game because both teams will want to win			0
you will have two committed teams who are at the stage in pre-season where they are starting to step up a bit			0
’ gearing up : @entity14 have seen off @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity146 in the @entity21 @entity186 @entity14 v @entity185 highlights @entity14 will find a @entity11 team highly motivated and confident enough to suggest that a journey from seventh to first in the space of one season may not be beyond them			1
@entity47 said : ‘ i do n’t think it ’s too much to expect to make the leap back up the table , we will be going out to win the league			2
hopefully , we can make amends for what happened last season			0
' we have beaten @entity136 , the @entity200 champions , and we now want to go on and beat @entity14			2
that is the sort of thing that gives the squad confidence			0
’ slip up : @entity25 is likely to be reminded of his untimely error by @entity11 fans on monday @entity14 ’s failure to close out last season ’s title provided @entity11 followers with some comfort in their year of austerity			1
captain @entity25 may be reminded of his part in that failure by rival fans in @entity15 tonight , but he will be comforted by the 20 - point margin that separated the two teams last may			2
fast forward three months and we are ready to go again			0
different competition , different country			0

@entity14 beat @entity11 3 - 0 last season and finished 20 points ahead of their rivals
but @entity11 are *revitalised* under @entity34
@entity47 says fixture ' is always a big deal '
