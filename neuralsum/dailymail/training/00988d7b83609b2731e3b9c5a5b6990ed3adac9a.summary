@entity0 will today try to shame other @entity2 leaders into doing more to tackle @entity3 after warning they need to ‘ wake up ’ to the crisis posed by the killer disease			1
the prime minister is expected to use a @entity10 leaders ’ summit in @entity11 to step up pressure on them to increase their contributions to fighting the outbreak			1
mr @entity0 , who has challenged @entity2 member states to provide a total of 1 billion euros ( £ 790m ) and 2,000 medical workers to tackle the outbreak , will point out how @entity22 ’s giving has so far dwarfed that of other countries			1
prime minister @entity0 , pictured today , is to use a summit in @entity11 to challenge other leaders to increase financial support for the fight against @entity3 a government source said : ‘ we are very much out in front in @entity32 on this and leading the way			1
we have pledged £ 125m ( 156m euros ) , which is 40million euros ahead of the next highest country , @entity37 , in aid			0
‘ it is four times more than @entity41 has pledged to date and 50 times more than @entity42 , which has obviously had cases in @entity44			0
’ following a meeting of @entity2 foreign ministers in @entity48 in monday , it is thought that around 750 million euros ( £ 593m ) and around 1,000 personnel may be on the table today , but mr @entity0 will push for more cash , healthcare workers and equipment to assist @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 , the three countries at the centre of the epidemic			1
‘ we are very clear that countries around the world need to recognise that by investing now to do more in the region , we help to protect ourselves from greater risk in the future , ’ the source added			0
‘ if all 28 countries turned up at the @entity10 and committed to do more , that would be quite a lot in terms of the three affected countries in the region			0
’ mr @entity0 will also use the summit to make clear that @entity22 regards the @entity74 's demand for a budget of 146.4 billion euros ( £ 115.8billion ) in 2015 - as well as extra top - up cash to cover overspending in 2014 - as unacceptable			1
mr @entity0 was in @entity78 for the launch of the @entity80 before travelling to @entity11 later @entity2 leaders agreed at a previous summit that next year 's budget should be no more than 140 billion euros ( £ 110.7billion ) , and the @entity29 source said that the @entity85 ' bid was ‘ unrealistic ’			1
‘ clearly we think that what the @entity74 are looking for is unrealistic in the current situation , at a time when families across the continent are dealing with the impact of the great recession , ’ said the source			2
‘ we think they should be looking more ruthlessly at how they prioritise spending			0
’ mr @entity0 will also seek the support of all 28 member - states for the position on @entity100 taken by him and three other @entity2 leaders in @entity102 last week , when they told @entity105 president @entity104 and @entity100 president @entity106 that @entity32 wants to see the implementation of last month 's @entity109 peace agreement , including more action by @entity111 to prevent the flow of weapons across the border			2
speaking about ebola at the @entity2 - @entity117 summit in @entity102 last week , mr @entity0 said : ‘ this is the biggest health problem facing our world in a generation			2
‘ @entity22 in my view has been leading the way			0
the action we ’re taking in @entity54 , where we are committing well over £ 100million , 750 troops , we are going to be training 800 members of health staff in @entity54 , providing 700 beds			0
‘ we are doing a huge amount and i think it ’s time for other countries to look at their responsibilities and their resources and act in a similar way to what @entity22 is doing in @entity54 , @entity137 ’s doing in @entity55 , @entity41 is doing in @entity56			0
‘ other countries now need to step forward with the resources and the action because taking action at source in west africa , that is the best way to protect all of us here in @entity32			2
