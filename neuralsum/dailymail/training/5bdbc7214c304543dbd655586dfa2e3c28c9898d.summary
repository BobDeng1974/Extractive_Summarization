anyone not clear of the genesis of @entity2 moving for @entity3 should probably be directed to the 31st minute of last season ’s @entity4			1
@entity7 ’s team had just been mauled , torn to shreds , by @entity9 in the @entity11 semi-final — a performance that the @entity13 calls the worst mistake of his entire career			1
everyone around the club was shattered by the 5 - 0 aggregate humiliation but the rallying call had been sounded for the domestic final against @entity21 ( the @entity2 executives are driven by a ferocious strategic wish to subjugate the northerners )			1
it was the ninth meeting between the @entity43 ’s two dominant forces in two seasons and the fourth in 10 months since the @entity13 had taken over at @entity2			1
in the previous three games @entity7 ’s side had won once , away , but lost the supercup 4 - 2 and been thumped 3 - 0 at the @entity49			1
risk : @entity2 have pledged to pay £ 16m over two years for a player about to turn 33 two defeats , seven goals conceded and now reeling from the five - goal thumping from @entity9			1
for this moment of huge significance @entity7 planned to flood the centre of the pitch but to ask huge amounts , tactically and physically , from @entity61 as the central , organising midfielder next to @entity64			1
after half an hour @entity61 had to come off , injured and in danger of missing the @entity66 if he continued			0
@entity7 looked around and found he needed to choose the out - of - form @entity68 , who had been fighting injury himself , to go on as @entity61 ’s replacement and play out of position in organising central midfield			1
one of the club ’s most quixotic and effective wingers ever , playing @entity7 ’s almost ‘ sacred ’ pivote position for the first time in his life to take over from a converted full - back			2
at one of the most powerful and wealthy clubs in the world			0
just after they had won the treble			0
match up : @entity33 and super-villain @entity84 in @entity86 it was a moment emblematic of the @entity13 ’s first season in charge			0
over the year he had used up to seven players in that position : the one which he himself played for @entity96 ’s ‘ @entity38 ’ and which is , without question , the mega-powerful microprocessor through which all team commands , all intelligent positional play and all the passing movements to restart play from the back must flow			2
@entity104 , @entity105 , @entity61 , @entity106 , @entity64 , @entity107 and @entity108 had all been asked to interpret that cerebral role — with varying degrees of success			0
partly that had been to do with @entity7 ’s fanatical drive to keep re-touching his playing scheme , to keep re-inventing and outmanoeuvring his opponents			2
mostly it had to do with the incessant injury crisis at the club — @entity7 did n’t have a fully - fit , injury - free squad until march and then that nirvana lasted about 10 days			2
the final ? yes , @entity2 won after extra-time and after still more tactical tinkering and @entity68 going off with the injury which cost him , not @entity61 , @entity66 participation			2
already this season @entity7 has lost one fulcrum player in @entity104 , whose knee - ligament damage means he is out for several months			2
@entity105 has played only 25 times in a year and is currently taking longer to recover from his third major injury at the club since joining			0
rivalry : @entity2 takes on @entity21 in last season 's @entity4 final the news that @entity106 will also be out for weeks , added to the fact that @entity2 ’s directors and sporting director @entity137 could n’t find a way to incentivise @entity64 — now at @entity9 — to stay , means that @entity7 was bound to act			1
@entity2 was once the @entity139 - elite club with the strictest transfer market and wage policy			2
but they ’ve just bought a man on the verge of turning 33 for what may well amount to £ 8million and to whom they ’ll pay a minimum of £ 8m in wages over two seasons			0
and could n’t they have used that much money to persuade @entity64 to stay ? or was there another reason for his exit ? it ’s a huge demonstration of faith in @entity7 , who specified that @entity3 was what was needed , and a declaration of further ambition to dominate both @entity161 and @entity162			1
@entity7 called @entity3 ‘ a great professional with a strong personality and , above all , an intelligent footballer ’			1
the @entity167 midfielder has been at the heart of the very football — @entity171 ’s world domination — which @entity2 want to replicate			1
they value his brain , his precision , his dedication , his ruthlessness and his experience			0
real deal : @entity2 could not persuade @entity64 to reject move to @entity9 as for @entity3 ? he renewed his @entity9 contract last december on being informed by them that a proposed freedom - of - contract move to @entity2 was n’t going to happen			1
his frankness , now , is admirable			0
‘ having won @entity184 ( @entity9 ’s 10th @entity11 ) i had the instinct that my time here was coming to an end			0
‘ i need certain incentives and they probably take the form of a new challenge , different ambitions			0
i saw a new cycle starting around me at @entity9 and to be at the highest level i thought i needed to test myself somewhere new			0
nobody at the club wanted me out , this was my decision			0
’ like @entity7 , he will handle the language and the fact he speaks @entity200 will help , while there ’s a good smattering of @entity36 at the club , too			2
while @entity7 ’s teams are always athletic and one of his maxims is that they must ‘ run and run and run ’ , it ’s @entity3 ’s positional intelligence and precision of passing which will matter more than the fact that his legs and lungs ended last season at a low ebb			1
in the @entity43 he ’ll find , compared to @entity171 , some of what he misses from @entity200 football : fuller , noisier stadia , 90 - minute sporting aggression — lots of @entity220 tilting at @entity221			0
and he calculates that he ’ll win his third @entity11 with a third different club			0
@entity7 and @entity3 — once fierce and unforgiving rivals across the @entity225 divide			1
watch out everyone else .			0

@entity2 coach @entity7 hailed @entity3 ' an intelligent footballer '
the @entity167 midfielder has been at the heart of the very football which the @entity234 champions want to replicate
