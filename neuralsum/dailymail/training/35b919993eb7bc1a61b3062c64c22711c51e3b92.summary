by @entity0 a police raid at an @entity3 - style cannabis lounge in @entity4 , @entity5 , has triggered a debate over where adults can smoke pot in a state that allows recreational marijuana consumption - but not in public			1
@entity4 police showed up last week at @entity13 , one of dozens of private pot - smoking clubs in @entity5 operating in a legal gray area			1
the officers handcuffed smokers , seized drug paraphernalia and ticketed the club 's owner for violating state law banning indoor cigarette smoking			1
three people were cited for smoking in public			1
inside the lounge : @entity4 police raided this @entity3 - style cannabis lounge in @entity5 , named @entity28 's @entity13 @entity5 law prohibits recreational pot consumption ' openly and publicly or in a manner that endangers others			1
' and state lawmakers say that smoke - free laws also appear to ban indoor pot smoke - outs			2
but marijuana advocates argue the increasingly popular private pot dens are permissible because marijuana is n't sold , nor is food or drink			1
like @entity28 's , the clubs are only for members , who bring their own weed			1
the officers entered @entity28 's on friday to investigate ' illegal activity ' - public marijuana consumption - when they issued the citations , department spokesman @entity44 said			1
he said police are not targeting other private pot clubs but that all pot - related businesses , including private lounges , are under new scrutiny since recreational sales began in @entity5 in january			1
' this is new for us , ' said @entity57 , @entity4 's executive director of marijuana policy , noting that police routinely look for pot clubs that are publicly advertising or who impose cover charges as a sham and then give away weed			1
' we 're going to be as proactive as we can and educate businesses as we go along			0
' @entity65 , who was inside @entity66 's at the time , said she recognized the plainclothes detectives because they had been inside the club before , posing as new members			1
one of them told her the club was a public place before they started issuing citations			2
@entity28 's @entity13 ( pictured ) is one of dozens of private cannabis lounges in @entity5 that operate in a legal gray area ' i asked , ' where is it safe ? '' @entity65 said			1
' he said , ' you 're legal to possess it and smoke it at home , and that 's it			2
' but @entity4 attorney @entity85 , who represents one of those cited , said the club is private			2
it does n't advertise specific events , and it requires memberships to get in , even if to smoke there for just one night			0
marijuana advocates argue the increasingly popular private pot dens are permissible because marijuana is n't sold , nor is food or drink @entity85 argued the raid was hypocritical			1
he noted that the city of @entity4 has allowed the @entity100 to hold a series of bring - your - own - cannabis fundraising concerts - labeled private events - after the symphony agreed to hold the shows by invitation only at private galleries			0
after days of wrangling , city officials concerned about public consumption withdrew their objections to three symphony events called @entity115 , which have marijuana companies as sponsors and are expected to raise $ 200,000 for the symphony			0
' this is an identical situation , ' @entity85 said			0
' it 's not even close to being a gray area			0
' the symphony took corrective action after the city warned them about public consumption and @entity28 's did not , @entity57 said			1
@entity85 said he was unaware of any formal warnings the club had received			0
the attorney represents @entity129 , who received a $ 135 citation for public consumption at @entity66 's			2
legal gray area : @entity5 law prohibits recreational pot consumption openly and publicly or in a manner that endangers others ( library image ) officers said they saw @entity129 , 25 , smoking hash oil from a water pipe , which they seized as evidence , according to his citation			1
the document also notes that his club membership was issued in june			0
@entity129 said he started buying nightly memberships at the club for $ 10 , and then bought a monthly pass			0
' it 's a place where people who are like - minded can get together and enjoy cannabis , ' said @entity129 , who was supposed to work as a @entity152 the night of the crackdown			2
' i feel safe there			0
' @entity129 said he plans to fight the ticket in court			0
@entity28 's has closed after the arrests			1
its patrons hope it would reopen , perhaps as a hookah lounge			0
owners of other private pot dens around the state are keeping an eye on the @entity4 case			2
' the number of clubs is going to increase , and the number of enforcement actions is going to decrease , ' @entity85 predicted			0
@entity172 , who owns @entity173 near @entity174 with his wife , @entity175 , said the club - cafe has not had any problems since it opened in march after more than a year of planning for proper ventilation and consulting with police , an attorney and zoning officials			2
still , the town of @entity185 has only allowed his club to operate for a six - month trial period			0
officials will then decide whether to extend its license			0
' we are just a test , ' @entity172 said .			0
