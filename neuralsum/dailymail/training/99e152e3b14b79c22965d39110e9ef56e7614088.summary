by @entity0 published : 10:04 est , 6 march 2013 updated : 20:37 est , 6 march 2013 a mother has told how social workers turned up while she was giving birth in hospital to say they would be taking her baby into care			1
without consulting her , social services chiefs had decided @entity9 was unfit to look after her baby because she had suffered from depression five years earlier after her ten - year - old son was found hanged			1
the officials arrived without warning to say the baby would go straight into foster care as they were concerned about mrs @entity9 ’s mental health			1
@entity9 is demanding an apology from @entity17 after her daughter @entity18 , now 18 months , was taken into foster care after her birth but the baby , a girl named @entity22 , had serious breathing problems and was transferred to intensive care			1
mrs @entity9 , 36 , said she was only allowed to spend two hours a day with her daughter , supervised by a social worker			1
she was forced to call a lawyer from hospital and ended up in court two days after the birth to plead her case			2
@entity18 ’s father , who lived apart from mrs @entity9 , was given temporary custody of the baby when @entity18 was discharged from hospital ten days after her birth , and for four months mrs @entity9 was only allowed two hours of supervised time each day with her child			1
miss @entity9 has since been reunited with @entity22 last night , the mother of five from @entity39 said : ‘ i feel very , very angry and very , very let down because i had overcome my mental health problems and was in a very good place and i was feeling proud and ready to be a mother			1
‘ then this came along and crushed me			0
i lost precious time with my daughter			2
i missed her first smile , i missed so much			0
’ the social workers were able to take @entity22 into care after obtaining an emergency protection order from @entity50 ’ court			1
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ they literally just walked in very coldly and said as soon as i had delivered my baby she was going to get placed into foster care			2
‘ i was in labour when they came in			0
to be honest i did n’t actually believe them , at first i thought it was some kind of joke			0
’ when she asked why @entity18 had to be fostered , she said they replied : ‘ because you are not well			2
’ according to mrs @entity9 ’s lawyer , @entity39 social services had gone too far when @entity18 was born in august 2011 , having failed to carry out a pre-birth assessment or case conference to discuss any possible intervention			1
solicitor @entity66 said that if proper procedures had been followed , social services may not have needed to take action			0
miss @entity66 added : ‘ i think it ’s a shocking example of a massive over-reaction by social services in @entity39			1
’ @entity22 is now 18 months old and happily living with her mother			0
but mrs @entity9 is demanding an apology from @entity39 social services , which she fears has not learned from its mistakes			1
miss @entity9 was in labour at @entity76 with her daughter @entity18 when social workers arrived to take her unborn daughter away her case follows a series of major failings by care bosses			1
in november , an @entity85 inspection found that children ’s care in @entity39 was still ‘ inadequate ’			2
the service had already been criticised over the deaths of seven children and failures that led to the torture of two boys by two brothers who were in foster care			0
mrs @entity9 said : ‘ people need to know what @entity39 social services are like , because they make mistake after mistake but they are not paying for it			1
‘ to me , they have got more power than the police , they can do what they want when they want			0
‘ nobody can make up for what they have taken away from me			0
they need to change the way they work			0
it ca n’t happen to anyone else			0
i was an experienced mum and yet i had to be supervised all the time i was caring for @entity22			2
‘ i am constantly terrified that there will be a knock on the door and that someone will come to take @entity22 away from me			0
’ @entity118 , director of @entity39 ’s children and @entity120 , said : ‘ it ’s inappropriate for us to comment on cases involving individual children			0
however , when any matter of concern is raised with me i do ask for this to be examined and i have done that in this case			0

@entity18 was taken away shortly after the birth in august 2011
