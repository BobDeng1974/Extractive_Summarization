by @entity0 , arts correspondent it is , perhaps , the best loved game show in @entity4 ’s tv history – fondly remembered by millions for its cheesy catchphrases and conveyor belt of less - than - thrilling prizes			1
at its peak in the late 1970s , @entity9 pulled in an astonishing 20 million viewers every saturday evening , first with @entity12 at the helm and then @entity14			0
and now the show is set to make a remarkable return			1
with comedienne @entity17 taking on the role of presenter			1
the @entity20 plans to screen the new version within a year , and a pilot episode is already taking shape , @entity24 understands			1
good game , good game : @entity17 recreates @entity12 's legendary pose in an interview last year ‘ everyone is excited about this happening , ’ said a @entity20 source who asked not to be named			1
‘ @entity17 is a great fan of the original show and she has made no secret of her admiration for sir @entity12 , the show ’s very first host			1
@entity17 and @entity9 could be a match made in telly heaven			1
’ @entity17 , 41 , who has established herself as one of the most popular family entertainers in @entity4 with her sitcom @entity17 and her role in hit drama @entity42 , will become the first female host of @entity9			1
@entity20 bosses say the idea is at the early stages and nothing has been formally confirmed , but they believe the combination of the show ’s format and @entity17 ’s family - friendly persona will prove ratings gold			1
the star herself is a huge fan of the show and sang its praises in an interview she did with @entity12 last year			1
she said : ‘ @entity12 is too modest to say this but i am going to say it for him			0
during the 1970s the @entity9 was getting over 20 million viewers every week and my family were among them			0
it is one of the greatest game shows ever			1
’ she even defended the programme when @entity12 himself said it might now be considered ‘ old hat ’			0
@entity12 , right , and @entity69 , centre , in action on the show			1
at its peak in the late 70s it pulled in 20million viewers a week the show ’s format involved couples of family members competing against each other in a series of challenges			2
typically the couples comprised family members who were a generation apart , such as mother and son			0
the new generation game is likely to be tweaked to make it relevant for a modern audience but insiders expect all the classic ingredients to remain the same			2
it is not known who will be @entity17 ’s co-host and whether the job will go to a man or a woman			1
one of hostesses in the original show , @entity69 , famously had an affair with @entity12 and married him in 1973 before divorcing him six years later			2
the @entity20 hopes the new version will prove as popular as @entity103 , which pulls in more than 11 million viewers			1
a @entity20 spokesman said : ‘ it ’s in the early ideas stage at the moment and nothing is confirmed , but it ’s an idea we are discussing with @entity17			1
’ family affair : @entity12 and @entity69 in 1973 the @entity9 was based on the successful @entity113 show @entity114 or one of the eight			2
an overnight hit when it launched on @entity118 in 1971 , the programme initially ran until 1982			0
however , it was successfully revived in 1990 and remained on tv until 2002			0
sir @entity12 , who hosted the programme between 1971 and 1977 and again between 1990 and 1994 , was the show ’s most famous presenter			1
he was succeeded the first time he left by camp comic @entity14 who presented the show from 1978 to 1982 and then @entity126 between 1995 and 2002			2
each of stars was assisted by a glamorous hostess who was often referred to as ‘ girl friday ’ in the politically incorrect 1970s			0
sir @entity12 married and divorced his first hostess , @entity69 , and was joined by @entity133 in 1990			0
@entity14 and his presenting partner @entity134 proved to be a popular double act and @entity126 had a succession of hostesses , including @entity138 , @entity139 and @entity140			2
each of the hosts had their own catchphrases , many of which endure to this day			0
@entity12 ’s best known lines included ‘ did n’t they do well ? ’ , ‘ @entity147 to see you , to see you , nice ! ’ , and ‘ give us a twirl ’			0
@entity14 ’s offerings included ‘ shut that door ’ and ‘ what a gay day ’			0
the show ’s format remained largely unchanged over the years			2
one of the most popular rounds involved competing couples watching a skilled professional construct something such as pottery or perform a tricky dancing routine			2
they would then attempt to do the same thing , often with disastrous results			0
best remembered , however , is the ‘ conveyor belt ’ finale			0
one half of the victorious team – or in later shows , both members – would sit behind the conveyor belt as a string of prizes passed before them , always including a cuddly toy			0
they would win all those they could recall within a set period of time .			0
