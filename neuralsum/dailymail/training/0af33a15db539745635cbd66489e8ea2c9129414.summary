by @entity0 published : 08:32 est , 20 january 2013 updated : 10:13 est , 20 january 2013 for nine decades the @entity1 has played an important part in remembering those @entity4 soldiers who have lost their lives in battle			2
every year a @entity7 is held at the central @entity9 monument to commemorate @entity4 and @entity11 servicemen and women who died in the two @entity13 and later conflicts but to mark 100 years since the @entity19 , the names of every @entity17 soldier who died during the conflict could appear alongside the @entity4 dead			1
the @entity1 in central @entity9 where wreaths are laid every year to remember the @entity4 soldiers who have lost their lives in battle and @entity17 flying - ace @entity24 , known as the @entity25 , ( right ) the @entity27 project has been drawn up by @entity28 , a 65 - year - old @entity29 actor and director , and have been submitted to @entity33 - @entity32 's special representative for centenary events			1
@entity28 told @entity35 : ' a soldier said to me , " once we are beneath ground , all men are equal			2
only the men above ground create differences			0
" ' the plans , which have the backing of @entity29 , include projecting the names of the war dead including @entity24 , known as the @entity25 , onto a wall behind the @entity1 starting from 2014 , a century after the year they died			1
the names of @entity4 servicemen and women would also be displayed for several minutes while overseas soldiers would be shown for 25 seconds each			0
it is believed the roll call would be made up of 9.5million names from all nations which took part in the @entity19			1
families would be able to look up the names of their relatives on a website to find out when they would appear			1
the roll call would begin a few weeks before @entity63 and would cost about £ 2.2m			1
@entity64 is expected to receive a bid for for about £ 150,000 which would cover @entity4 's share of the cost			0
but major - general @entity68 , an adviser to the @entity69 on centenary events , said the public may not support the idea of @entity17 soldiers being remembered at the @entity1			0
he said : ' i would hope that by 2018 ... we would be able to understand we won the war but also that a lot of good @entity17 men sacrificed themselves for their own country			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity81 , added : ' there are many innovative ideas around the @entity19 commemorations , and we are aware of the @entity29 initiative , which is attracting support both in @entity29 and elsewhere			2
' we are clear , however , that any project would need a partner organisation and sponsorship , if it were to be successful here			0
