by @entity0 with its bright orange roof and a conservatory - style garden room , it bears something of a resemblance to ' @entity7 ' , one - time home of @entity9 and @entity10			1
this is @entity12 , the new country seat of the @entity14 and @entity15 , as it nears the end of what is believed to have been a £ 1.5million - plus refurbishment			1
the glass - roofed 16ft by 16ft garden room will host a large dining table , allowing @entity22 and @entity15 to look up at the stars as they dine			1
@entity12 is on the @entity25 's @entity24 in @entity26			1
the previous tenant was asked to move out by her majesty and the house has been converted for the @entity14 and @entity15 around £ 500,000 was spent putting new tiles on the roof which some have complained are too bright			1
according to an expert , they will weather after five years before : the old house had a much duller grey roof			2
the wood store ( top left ) has now been converted into a nanny flat , while the garage block ( bottom right ) is now accommodation for police protection officers it also links the house to an old wood store which has been transformed into a ‘ nanny flat ’ for @entity47 , who was recently employed by the couple to look after @entity49			2
the couple already have a 20 - room apartment in @entity52 , which has been brought up to scratch with the help of £ 1.5million - worth of taxpayer - funded improvements			1
but the @entity25 decided to give the couple the 200 - year - old @entity56 * - listed mansion on her @entity24 in @entity26 after asking her existing tenant , who still had several years left to run on his lease , to move out			1
work on the ten - bedroom house began in september after @entity64 agreed a series of planning applications that were never published ‘ for reasons of national security ’			0
royal sources say @entity15 plans to use the rest of her ‘ maternity leave ’ to focus on finishing the house			1
one said : ‘ she is going to spend a great deal of time there over the next few weeks with a view to being able to move in this summer			0
' the family will spend most weekends there , although @entity52 will remain their primary residence			0
the works also included building a ' garden room ' , which is 16ft by 16ft and will house a new dining table			1
it also has a glass roof so guests can dine under the stars the country home also includes a tennis court ( left ) and an outdoor swimming pool ( above the main house ) though these were in place before the renovation started the most noticeable difference at the @entity96 mansion , which already has an outdoor pool and tennis court , is the new clay pantiles roof , estimated to have cost in excess of £ 500,000			1
according to @entity107 , managing director of @entity104 , a @entity105 - based group specialising in refurbishments , the tiles are actually ‘ rather bog standard ’			0
‘ surprisingly , they are n’t much different from the kind of tiles you and i would have on our houses and are actually in keeping with a traditional - style house , ’ he said			2
‘ the colour is rather bright but they will weather and in five years or so will look as if they have been there for ever			0
’ a further £ 100,000 will have been spent on replacing the dormer windows which have been rebuilt in timber with lead roofs			0
the most eye - catching addition is the garden room , estimated to have cost £ 250,000 - £ 300,000 and designed by @entity126 , one of prince @entity128 ’s favourite architects the original plans showed it with a tiled roof , but a second application requested a glazed roof , allowing more sunlight to flood in			1
the 200 - year - old property had rotting window frames replaced on the upstairs windows , while more money was spent beefing up security to keep the royal couple safe signs have been put up warning that the area is strictly private			2
all the work at @entity12 has been paid for by the @entity144 as it is privately owned by the queen according to mr @entity107 , a member of the @entity146 , the conservatory jars with the rest of the building			2
‘ it looks like it has been rather stuck on and does n’t really fit with the rest of the property , ’ he said			0
‘ they have incorporated columns to match those on the door to the building but the roof tiles do n’t even match			2
prince @entity128 would probably describe it as a carbuncle anywhere else , although i would n’t go that far			0
but it just does n’t flow with the rest of the property			0
’ other major works include rerouting the main driveway to sweep across a field in front of the house to give the family greater privacy			0
the main gate to the house has been re-sited further down the driveway to keep away onlookers			0
a garage block has been converted into accommodation for the couple ’s personal protection officers and the front lawn dug up to create extra parking			1
although the cost of the works is being met privately by the @entity144 , @entity182 is recruiting extra armed officers to guard the property round the clock .			0

@entity12 , on the @entity25 's @entity24 in @entity26 , has been renovated for @entity14 and @entity15
estimated £ 1.5million bill included £ 500,000 to replace roof tiles and another £ 500,000 to *landscape* the front lawn
@entity195 included a new ' garden room ' , a 16ft by 16ft space which will house a dining table and has a glass ceiling
home was being privately rented from the @entity25 , but tenant was asked to move out early for the royal couple
