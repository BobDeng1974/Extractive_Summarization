@entity1 die - offs of certain animals has increased in frequency every year for seven decades , according to a new study			1
researchers found that such events , which can kill more than 90 per cent of a population , are increasing among birds , fish and marine invertebrates			2
the reasons for the die - offs are diverse , with effects tied to humans such as environmental contamination accounting for about a fifth of them			1
three @entity19 institutions say mass die - offs are now more common			1
they have increased by one event per year for 70 years			1
pictured are dead tilapia floating near @entity24 in @entity25 , @entity19 on 19 januray 11			2
they were killed by erosion and high toxicity levels from farm runoff the research was carried out by three @entity19 institutions - the @entity31 , @entity32 and the @entity33 - and published in the @entity34			1
@entity1 mortality events occur when a large percentage of a population dies in a short time frame			2
while they are rare and fall sort of an extinction , they still pack a devastating punch			0
the analysis of 727 published @entity45 from across the globe , affecting 2,407 animal populations , found that the magnitude of such events since 1940 has been intensifying for birds , fishes and marine invertebrates , decreasing for reptiles and amphibians and staying the same for mammals			0
the most severe events were those with multiple causes , the paper shows			0
although mass mortality events are often a natural event ' the most alarming and interesting result was the sheer magnitude of some of these mortality events , ' dr @entity60 of the @entity31 said			2
' billions of individuals dying are just huge numbers to comprehend			0
the study provides yet another example of the challenges to life that organisms are confronted with on a planet increasingly dominated by the influence of humans in the environment			0
' ' this is the first attempt to quantify patterns in the frequency , magnitude and cause of such mass kill events , ' said study senior author dr @entity85 , an associate professor at @entity33 's @entity86			2
the researchers reviewed incidents of mass kills documented in scientific literature			0
although they came across some sporadic studies dating back to the 1800s , the analysis focused on the period from 1940 to the present			0
the researchers acknowledged that some of their findings may be due to an increase in the reporting of mass die - offs in recent decades			1
but they noted that even after accounting for some of this reporting bias , there was still an increase in mass die - offs for certain animals			1
overall , disease was the primary culprit , accounting for 26 per cent of the mass die - offs			1
direct effects tied to humans , such as environmental contamination , caused 19 percent of the mass kills			0
@entity115 triggered by events such as algae blooms accounted for a significant proportion of deaths , and processes directly influenced by climate - including weather extremes , thermal stress , oxygen stress or starvation - collectively contributed to about 25 percent of mass mortality events			2

' the catastrophic nature of sudden , mass die - offs of animal populations inherently captures human attention , ' said dr @entity85			1
' in our studies , we have come across mass kills of federal fish species during the summer drought season as small streams dry up			0
' the majority of studies we reviewed were of fish			0
when oxygen levels are depressed in the water column , the impact can affect a variety of species			0
' the study found that the number of mass mortality events has been increasing by about one event per year over the 70 years the study covered			1
' while this might not seem like much , one additional mass mortality event per year over 70 years translates into a considerable increase in the number of these events being reported each year , ' said study co-lead author dr @entity60 , an assistant professor of biology at the @entity31			1
' going from one event to 70 each year is a substantial increase , especially given the increased magnitudes of mass mortality events for some of these organisms			2

' in our studies , we have come across mass kills of federal fish species during the summer drought season as small streams dry up ' ( stock image shown ) this study suggests that in addition to monitoring physical changes such as changes in temperature and precipitation patterns , it is important to document the biological response to regional and global environmental change			0
the researchers highlighted ways to improve documentation of such events in the future , including the possible use of citizen science to record mass mortality events in real time			0
' the initial patterns are a bit surprising , in terms of the documented changes to frequencies of occurrences , magnitudes of each event and the causes of mass mortality , ' said study co-lead author dr @entity230 , a postdoctoral fellow in ecology and evolutionary biology at @entity32			2
' yet these data show that we have a lot of room to improve how we document and study these types of rare events			0

the *worst* cases were the result of multiple causes
