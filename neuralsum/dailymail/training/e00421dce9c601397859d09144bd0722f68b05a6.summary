leaving before the rains come by @entity1 that awful book , was how @entity1 ’s mother , @entity4 , always referred to @entity5 , her daughter ’s bestselling account of growing up in @entity7			1
but @entity4 — whose love of literature was exceeded only by her passion for alcohol — had always encouraged her daughter to write , and she became the heroine of @entity1 ’s second memoir , @entity15			1
in her latest memoir , @entity1 turns her fiercely observant gaze on her own life as a wife and mother , telling the story of the marriage that took her from the perils of @entity7 to a very different kind of hazard in @entity26			1
‘ when i was breaking down my reason for marrying @entity32 to other people , ’ she writes , ‘ i said , “ he looked good on a horse			1
” what i never would have confessed was the truth : at 22 , i was already exhausted and what i projected onto @entity32 ’s broad - shouldered frame was an embellished biography that made him both my sanctuary and my saviour			1
‘ i believed if i moored myself to @entity32 , i would know tranquillity interspersed with organised adventure			1
’ @entity1 ’s early childhood was fraught with adventure of the most catastrophic kind			1
growing up in a country undergoing the bloody metamorphosis from @entity49 into @entity50 , she and her sister , @entity46 , travelled in an armoured @entity51 and learned to strip and fire a gun			2
they dressed for dinner each night , and were taught that the greatest sin of all was to be boring			2
but just below the brittle surface of old - fashioned , upper - class social mores lay chaos and death			2
three of @entity1 ’s four siblings died young , and the accumulation of tragedy tipped her mother into depression and alcoholism			1
‘ it takes a kind of outrageous courage			0
to revel in the pattern of that much definite chaos , ’ she writes			0
‘ i had been raised in this way			0
but at some point , i had lost the mettle and the imagination to surrender to the promise of perpetual insecurity			0
’ @entity78 seemed to offer the ideal combination of excitement and security			0
eleven years older than @entity82 , he was a dashing adventurer with a degree in international business , who told stories about white water rafting in @entity87 and helicopter skiing in @entity89			2
best of all , he seemed unworried by the prospect of meeting her parents			0
when she warned him that her father would probably wave a shotgun at him , he said : ‘ that ’s ok			0
i ’ve spent every summer of my life on my grandmother ’s ranch in @entity26 and she waves her shotgun at everyone , especially after cocktail hour			1
’ six months later , they were engaged			0
six months after that , she married him on her parents ’ farm			0
at the wedding , an old , @entity109 priest told her : ‘ the first year is hard and , after that , it gets worse			2
almost as soon as the honeymoon was over , the marriage ran into trouble : ‘ the first year was hard and , after that			2
it got more and more silent , and silence frightened me more than almost anything else			0
’ @entity32 ’s safari business struggled , @entity82 could n’t find a job and , when their first baby was born , their charming but mosquito - infested cottage on the banks of the @entity122 proved an impossible place in which to live with a newborn			1
by the time they decided to leave @entity7 for @entity131 , ‘ @entity32 ’s love for me was waning — i ’d been a disappointment , it was obvious			1
but i was still his wife and the mother of his child ; there still remained a residue of dutiful love in sickness and in health ’			0
after 15 years , two more children and much couples ’ counselling , that residue of dutiful love was exhausted			0
@entity32 ’s real estate business was crippled by the 2008 @entity131 mortgage crisis , and @entity1 ’s attempts to write them out of trouble were n’t enough			1
by 2011 , they were so trapped by debt that when @entity1 asked for a divorce , @entity32 told her they could n’t afford it : everything they owned belonged to the bank			1
when circumstances are intolerable , something has to give			0
five months after their 19th wedding anniversary , @entity32 ’s horse , @entity160 , fell and rolled on him			1
he suffered a series of strokes and his life was saved only when @entity1 insisted , against medical advice , that he be moved to a hospital with an expert neurology unit			2
in the movies , this would be the moment the couple rediscovered their love			2
but there is no fairytale ending here : ‘ you can have an intense connection to someone without being a good , lifelong mate for him			0
@entity182 is complicated and difficult that way			0
’ to use your own life as the raw material for a book is an enterprise fraught with hazard			0
yet in this hauntingly beautiful memoir , @entity1 combines unsparing — and often very funny — self - analysis with an aching tenderness for the family she and @entity32 could n’t keep intact and a deep love of @entity7 , the beloved country of her childhood where she no longer really belongs .			1

she tells of the marriage that took her from @entity7 to @entity26
the 2008 @entity131 mortgage crisis left the couple trapped by debt
when @entity1 asked for a divorce , @entity32 told her they could n’t afford it
@entity1 combines self - analysis with an aching tenderness for her family
