in what may be the most unlikely duo to show up at any @entity4 after party , @entity1 @entity0 attended @entity7 's sunday night soiree arm - in - arm with none other than @entity9			1
the odd couple looked to be having a great time , with the one - time political hopeful all in black and the @entity14 performer in an all nude - colored suit			1
it was a rare , and high profile , glimpse at the duo who 've been the best of friends since not long after @entity9 became the country 's most infamous intern			1
' they 'd done a thing about her and i 'd done an article for @entity33 and we were at the same table			1
[ we ] went for dinner and we just stayed friends			2
' fast forward to today and the two are still tight			2
' she 's really one of my best friends , ' @entity0 said			0
' asked what he thinks has coaxed @entity9 back into the public eye after all these years -- the 41 - year - old was almost never heard from up until last may , when she wrote a widely - read article for @entity52 -- @entity0 said its just his friend 's time to return to the world			0
' to actually try and hide and not be a part , not be in the world , was so difficult and was so kind of frustrating for her , ' he revealed			0
the pair have been friends since the late 90s , right as @entity9 's infamy and @entity0 's fame were in their infancy ' we met at a party about 16 years ago , ' said @entity0 , ' [ we ] went for dinner and we just stayed friends			0

the former @entity69 intern and the @entity14 star have been thick as *thieves* since the *1990s*
