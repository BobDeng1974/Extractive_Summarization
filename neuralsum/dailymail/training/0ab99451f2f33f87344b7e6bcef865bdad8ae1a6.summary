former @entity1 skipper @entity0 believes the @entity3 support will put their differences with the club 's board to one side for a day as they pay tribute to @entity10			1
a host of retired @entity13 favourites will turn out for a charity game on sunday in honour of the @entity16 , who is battling @entity17			1
but so far only half the available tickets for the @entity3 match have been sold			1
former @entity1 midfielder @entity10 ( centre ) is battling @entity17 @entity16 midfielder @entity10 played for @entity1 between 2000 and 2006 the @entity22 faithful have been engaged in a long - running dispute with the ruling regime at the club and attendances at @entity3 have sunk to record low levels			1
however , @entity0 believes all that will be forgotten about come sunday as he predicted a sell - out crowd			2
the 36 - year - old - who won five @entity33 titles over two spells with the @entity36 giants - said : ' i 'm looking forward to the match			1
it 's for a great cause			2
i 'm really looking forward to meeting a lot of the lads i played with			2
' everything that has happened to @entity10 just makes you appreciate life a lot more			1
' it 's a difficult time but i 'm just doing a small part by showing up to pay my respects			1
you just need to see the turnout from former players who are coming to support him			2
' i just hope the crowd is a big one			2
i 've heard it 's at 23,000 or 24,000 and i just hope it 's a full house for the guy because he was a tremendous servant for the club			2
he captained it to trophies , so i hope there 's a good turnout for him			2
' i have no doubt the fans will forget about the off - field stuff and their issues with the way the club is being run			0
it 's @entity10 's day			1
let 's not forget that			0
' he 's going through a hard time			0
i 'm sure the fans will realise ( the profits ) are going to @entity10 , his kid , @entity17 and various other charities			1
i 'm more than sure there will be a great turnout for him			0
' @entity0 has called on @entity1 to show up in numbers to support @entity10 @entity84 is among a host of former @entity1 players who have agreed to take part in friendly among the big names who will be pulling on a blue jersey once more are @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity84 and @entity94 - who has become the latest former @entity3 player to sign up to fan - ownership group @entity96			1
it will allow the club 's faithful to put their current difficulties to one side and remember the days when it was silverware and not boardroom battles that dominated their thoughts			0
but @entity0 admits watching former team - mate @entity10 struggle with his debilitating - and ultimately fatal - illness will leave sunday 's occasion tinged with sadness			1
' @entity10 is some character , ' he said			1
' everything i know about him , you could n't repeat it outside of closed doors			0
@entity117 will be barred from making an appearance at the friendly match , according to reports ' he 's faced this with a lot of bravery and i take my hat off to him			2
he was like that as a player - a tough cookie			0
he 's handling it really well			0
' even today when i met him he is still bright and he is excited about the game			0
' but it 's hard when you see a guy of his age going through what he is			0
he 's only a year older than myself			0
you need to enjoy life			0
' reports this week have suggested axed boss @entity117 will be barred for making an appearance alongside the other former players under the terms of his garden leave			0
but @entity0 hit back : ' if @entity142 wants to come and support @entity10 i do n't see why he should n't be allowed to			1
' it 's a great cause			0
@entity10 has a terrible illness and if someone wants to come and show their support for @entity10 , i do n't see why it should be a problem			1
' meanwhile , the @entity150 has announced it has now passed the one - million share threshold after buying up another chunk of shares in the club .			0
