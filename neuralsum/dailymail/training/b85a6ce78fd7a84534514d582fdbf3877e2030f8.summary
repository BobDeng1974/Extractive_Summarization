bloated beyond recognition , with his long hair dyed blond and sporting a grey goatee , notorious conman @entity0 – a former friend of @entity1 – was dramatically arrested in @entity6 yesterday after a year on the run			1
his dishevelled appearance was a stark contrast to the sharp figure he cut while promoting his worthless @entity12 slimming products in @entity14 more than 30 years ago			0
the 52 - year - old self - confessed ‘ international man of mischief ’ , who later became the central figure in the infamous 2002 @entity25 scandal , was pounced on by police at his hideout near the @entity18 holiday town of @entity19			1
he was quickly subdued and dragged away to a police van – but the first stop was n’t a police cell			0
instead , the fugitive was taken to hospital after he suffered what a police spokesman described as ‘ a turn ’ , the nature of which was not known , while being arrested			0
@entity0 is expected to appear before a @entity54 court in the next few days to face a sentencing hearing for his involvement in a weight loss scheme – he is banned from taking part in any such schemes in @entity6			2
a @entity61 judge has already decided he will go to jail for three years			0
but because @entity0 failed to appear in court for the sentencing hearing late last year and was judged to be in contempt of court , after which he remained ‘ on the run ’ for a year , he is certain to be ordered to serve added jail time			1
the man who made millions of pounds by selling franchises for weight - loss products – which were found in scientific tests to be ineffective – first made headlines in @entity14 in the 1980s when he dated models and even took one on a six - month tour of @entity77 in a @entity78			1
@entity0 has previously been jailed in the @entity14 , the @entity79 and @entity6 because of his forbidden involvement in the slimming industry he looked dramatically different on tuesday when he was captured by a number of officers on the @entity18 coast footage from his arrest on tuesday shows officers surrounding the wanted man before pinning him to the ground in 2002 @entity1 , wife of of former @entity14 prime minister @entity90 allegedly purchased two apartments with the help of the @entity6 conman later he began an affair with @entity1 ’s fitness ‘ guru ’ @entity95			1
it was through @entity98 that he agreed to help the - then @entity101 prime minister ’s wife to purchase two flats in @entity103 for a discounted price			1
it resulted in mrs @entity1 sending him an email saying he was ‘ a star ’			1
when she learned of his notoriety , she tearfully admitted her mistake in public			0
@entity0 has boasted to the @entity110 that he has been in prison in @entity14 , the @entity79 and @entity6 but insisted he had never been convicted of fraud			2
rather , he said , he had been found guilty of advertising misdemeanours			0
during his time in @entity14 , he befriended @entity95 , @entity1 ’s fitness ' guru ' which is how he came to get close to the @entity90 family he was jailed for false advertising in the @entity14 and later faced similar punishment in the @entity79			1
convictions in the past did not stop him continuing to be involved in the weight loss industry in @entity6 and he found himself behind bars again , this time in @entity61			2
on being freed , he became a silent partner in another weight loss scam and was due to be sentenced last year when he disappeared - only to post photos of himself enjoying kava in @entity129			1
but reports began to emerge that he had been seen in northern @entity18 - and now it appears that those reports had foundation , with his arrest near @entity19			2
@entity0 was jailed for false advertising in the @entity14 and later faced similar punishment in the @entity79 having heard @entity0 boast of his ability to date beautiful women , his former lawyer @entity138 has described him as a ‘ narcissistic psychopath ’			0
when he heard that @entity0 had been arrested , mr @entity138 , who has claimed that the conman has threatened him over the phone , said last night that he was relieved			0
he told the @entity145 that he had always believed @entity0 was living near @entity19 and not in @entity129 as the conman had claimed with a series of internet photos allegedly showing him in the @entity150 nation			2
‘ i think it is sad that it has taken police so long to find him , ’ said mr @entity138			0
‘ i understood that he had a friend rent a couple of houses for him and he has been hopping between the two for months			0
’ the @entity110 revealed in 2002 that @entity1 had used @entity6 conman @entity0 to obtain a discount on two luxury flats in @entity103 for her			1
there were strong denials from the @entity164 that they even knew @entity0 , but the lie was laid bare when on december 5 the @entity110 published a series of emails between @entity0 and mrs @entity1 discussing the purchase of the flats			1
@entity171 , pictured with @entity95 , who at the time was in a relationship with @entity0 @entity0 , who was involved in an affair with mrs @entity1 ’s fitness ‘ guru ’ @entity95 at the time , told the prime minister ’s wife he had managed to get a £ 69,000 discount , adding : ‘ let me know if i can be of service ... as i tell @entity95 , your pleasure is my purpose			1
’ he went on to tell mrs @entity1 that the mortgage could be handled by his accountant who ‘ will not charge you for his services as i will pay him through my company ’			2
mrs @entity1 replied that ‘ you are a star ’ and later , after meeting him at @entity192 ’s gym , wrote to him on november 9 telling him that she could not thank him enough for taking the negotiations over for her and hoped they could ‘ see each other again soon ’			1
@entity196 initially stated that @entity0 was not , and had not been , a financial adviser to the @entity90 family			0
but after the @entity110 exposed the emails , mrs @entity1 tearfully apologised for denying @entity0 ’s involvement			1
no 10 said that if mrs @entity1 had known of his past she would have been more circumspect			2
but @entity0 ’s background had been well documented before @entity25			0
in 1994 he was fined £ 21,000 for a trading standards offence relating to his @entity205 weight loss tea , and two years later he was jailed for breaching laws regarding distribution of slimming granules			0
he escaped from prison and went to @entity6 , where he was extradited to @entity14			0
later he was jailed in the @entity79 for another trading standards offence – and when he returned to @entity14 in 2000 he was jailed again , briefly , for using fraudulent documents to obtain credit for a slimming cream company			0
