@entity20 and @entity21 had gastric bypass surgery when they each weighed 28 stone			1
the pair knew they had to do something about their weight when carrying out simple tasks became an effort and @entity21 , then a size 28 , snapped two chairs under her weight			1
half her size : @entity20 is a now a size 14 , having shed 14 stone ... ... meanwhile daughter @entity20 is a size 16 and weighs 18 stone			1

married mother - of - two @entity20 , 53 , said : ' we joke that we got two - for - one , mother - daughter gastric bypasses			1
' before they changed their lifestyles , @entity20 and @entity21 , 25 , used to eat more than 4,000 calories a day in sugar and carb - heavy food			2
for breakfast @entity20 would munch on buttery toast , while @entity21 would go without eating			2
lunch would be four cheese sandwiches with crisps for @entity20 , while @entity21 would eat cheese sandwiches with a @entity61			2
junk food binges : the pair would often gorge on unhealthy snacks @entity65 successful : the pair have never felt better since having gastric bypasses for dinner , @entity20 used to eat a large portion of spaghetti bolognese and @entity21 would eat an extra-large portion of curry with rice , bread and butter and six chapatis			1
both women snacked throughout the day on biscuits , cheese and @entity21 could scoff six @entity80 ice - cream bars , eight bags of crisps and four cans of @entity84 in one day			2
in 2010 , they decided enough was enough fearing they could die young because of their unhealthy eating			0
they sought help and @entity20 was told she would be able to have a gastric bypass operation on the @entity5 because she was diabetic			1
food swap : on the left , some of the foods they would eat daily including chocolate , cakes and crisps , and right , some of the healthy foods they eat now meanwhile , @entity21 had to pay for the op herself using Â£ 10,000 she borrowed through a loan			1
although their operations were nine months apart and took place at different hospitals in @entity107 , the pair had the same surgeon - dr @entity108			0
since having the ops , @entity20 and @entity21 have swapped cheese and biscuits for fresh fruit and yoghurt , and enjoy smaller portions of healthy meals			0

a month after her bypass surgery , @entity21 , already a mum , found she was expecting twins with husband @entity122			2

i can play and walk with the kids more than ever			0
' @entity21 said she is delighted with her and her mother 's weightloss and they have no regrets about the surgery			2
' we 're the dream team ! we both feel like our lives have improved so much			0
now when we walk into a clothes shop we can try on whatever we want - it 's an incredible feeling			0
' she added : ' before , we 'd sit in the car park after a going to the supermarket and eat an entire salami each , plus polish off a whole block of cheese			0
now , we eat much less and much better			0
i 'm so proud of my mum , i think she looks amazing			2
we both look a lot better			0
' she also thinks going through the weightloss journey has made them closer			0
' since cutting out the junk food our relationship is stringer than ever			1
