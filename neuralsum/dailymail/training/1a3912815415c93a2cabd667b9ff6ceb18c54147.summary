the terrorist group boasted on @entity11 that they ' stormed ' the facility as part of its war on drones because it was a base from which @entity8 personnel operated the remote - controlled planes			2
@entity20 ( @entity20 ) - regarded by @entity21 as the jihadist network 's most dangerous affiliate - has suffered heavy losses after the @entity8 intensified drone strikes in @entity4 this year			1
all of the dead came in a hospital inside the sprawling facility which bore the brunt of the armed assault that came after a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle packed with explosives into the main gate			1
the complex in central @entity34 was ' stormed ... after the mujahedeen ( holy warriors ) proved that it accommodates drone control rooms and @entity8 experts , ' @entity20 said in a statement published by its media arm on @entity11			1
' as part of a policy to target drone control rooms , the mujahedeen have dealt a heavy blow to one , ' it said			1

( pictured an artist impression of a @entity80 firing a missile ) the use of drones to attack suspected militants has become an extremely controversial topic with @entity8 accused of killing innocent people during operations			2

speaking at the time , col. @entity92 , director of public affairs for @entity95 's @entity94 , said a preliminary investigation had found that although the airstrike killed eight insurgents , ‘ there were , unfortunately , believed to be three civilian casualties , ’ for which the @entity94 expressed ‘ deep regret			0
’ @entity8 air force maj. gen. @entity103 , who commands air operations in @entity91 , added : ‘ our goal is to eradicate civilian casualties , but that is an incredibly difficult task when the enemy is intermixed with the civilian population			0
' @entity110 : smoke rises from the @entity33 's compound after an attack , in @entity34 yesterday the number of dead from @entity8 drone strikes in @entity4 remains unclear and estimates vary widely			1

according to a @entity127 report published in october , the @entity8 has carried out 80 targeted operations in @entity4 since 2009 , including strikes from drones , warplanes and cruise missiles - killing at least 473 people			1

but residents in @entity34 said the sounds of clashes and explosions rang out from the area and were heard across the capital throughout the night until fighting subsided at dawn on friday			0
the area was cordoned off in the morning while armoured vehicles blocked all roads leading to the defence complex , witnesses said			0
a search was mounted for two suspected bomb - laden vehicles the militants were planning to use in more attacks , said security officials , who added that up to 25 militants had carried thursday 's assault			0
the brazen daylight attack on the complex followed a spate of hit - and - run strikes on military personnel and officials , as @entity4 struggles to complete a thorny political transition			0
