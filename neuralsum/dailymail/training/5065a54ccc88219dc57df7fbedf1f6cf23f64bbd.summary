a candidate standing to be on the ruling council of the @entity2 has been criticised after likening the treatment of farm animals to the holocaust			1
@entity6 made the comments as candidates standing in the election are in the final push for votes , which have to be cast by tuesday			1
but the @entity12 says even though they too oppose ' factory farming ' , using the word holocaust will only offend and alienate people from their cause			1
@entity6 said some animals are being treated abysmally on farms and likened their treatment to the holocaust ( file picture ) mrs @entity6 said some animals are being treated abysmally on farms and said people were n't always aware of the ' holocaust ' happening to animals			1
she is one of six candidates standing to be on the charity 's council , with five seats available on the 25 member body			2
according to the @entity2 website , the council is an integral part of the charity and elected members are responsible for providing leadership and direction as well as making sure their resources are being used to benefit animal welfare			2
but speaking to the @entity41 , mrs @entity6 said : ' i do n't think people always appreciate what is the holocaust going on behind closed doors			1
' you talk about the @entity47			0
this probably sounds like animal rights , but if you recognise animals as sentient beings , why are we treating them so abysmally on farms ? ' but @entity55 director of the @entity12 said that her comments will not help the vegetarian and animal cause			1
she added : ' we are passionate about using positive messaging to spread awareness			0
our focus , therefore , is very much on highlighting the many benefits of adopting a vegetarian diet			0
@entity64 , who stood down as the chief executive of the @entity2 in february ' whilst we share @entity67 's opposition to factory farming , we do not believe anything positive can come from making comparisons with the holocaust			1
' using the word ' holocaust ' is not going to advance the vegetarian cause , rather , it will only serve to offend , divide , and quite possibly , alienate people			1
' the emphasis should always be on engaging and educating the public in a responsible and meaningful way			0
' the @entity81 also said her comments were disrespectful to the @entity12 community			1
the results of the @entity2 council election will be announced at the charity 's annual general meeting later this month			0
it is thought that the election could prove to be a turning point for the charity who hope to appoint a new chief executive by early next year			0
in february , @entity64 announced he would be stepping down with immediate effect after a controversial two years in the post			0
mr @entity64 , 59 , attracted heavy criticism for the decision to spend £ 326,000 prosecuting the @entity100 in @entity101 for illegal foxhunting , the hunt @entity97 used to ride in before the ban			0
critics said the ‘ staggering ’ expense of bringing the case at the end of 2012 , which was successful , was nonetheless a waste of the money donated by members of the public			0
he was also under fire last year for suggesting farmers who participated in the badger cull - permitted by the government to try and control tuberculosis in cattle - should be ‘ named and shamed ’			0
his unexpected departure as chief executive was due to ‘ medical concerns about his health ’ , the animal charity said in a statement at the time mrs @entity6 's comments come after earlier this year the singer @entity129 claimed ' if you believe in the abattoir then you would support @entity130 '			2
the @entity132 frontman made the remark in a q&a session on his fan site - true to you			2
the controversial singer has long been known as an animal rights activist .			2
