billions of pounds of @entity2 aid money is languishing unspent in the bank , mps warn today			2
in a highly critical report , the @entity6 international development committee says ministers wrote out huge cheques to a series of major aid agencies like the @entity12 as they scrambled to meet @entity14 ’s controversial target to spend billions more on aid			1
but although the money has been promised , and counts towards meeting the @entity2 ’s aid target , much of it will not be spent for years			0
disaster : villagers clean up their destroyed homes after it was hit by @entity23 on @entity24 in @entity25 last week today ’s report estimates that at least £ 2.1 billion of ‘ aid ’ money is currently sitting in the bank unspent			1
it warns that ministers have become ‘ increasingly reliant ’ on multilateral organisations like the @entity12 as they try to get billions more pounds of aid money out of the door			1
this type of spending was increased by 43 per cent over the previous year as the department rushed to hit mr @entity14 ’s target of spending 0.7 per cent of @entity2 ’s income on aid			0
targets : @entity14 has a target of spending 0.7 % of @entity2 's income on aid in a further criticism of the aid target , mps say it distorts spending towards the end of the year – meaning that victims of natural disasters in the autumn are much more likely to get aid from @entity2 than those who are hit by catastrophe in the spring			1
the @entity52 ( @entity52 ) gave £ 6.3 billion to so - called multilateral aid agencies in 2013 – roughly 63 per cent of its budget			2
today ’s report says mps are ‘ concerned by @entity52 ’s extensive use of multilateral organisations to achieve this growth ( in spending )			2
due to the way this is accounted for , some of this money will not be spent for a number of years			0
’ a @entity52 spokesman last night defended the department ’s spending			0
the spokesman said : ‘ we fund multilaterals when they are the best partners to work with us to deliver our objectives , whether that be in a humanitarian crisis , natural disaster or on a specific topic such as migration and refugees			1
‘ we are living in a world that is facing unprecedented humanitarian pressures			0
the @entity2 is proud to be a world leader in responding to emergencies			0
