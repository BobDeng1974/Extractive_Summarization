the @entity0 and the @entity1 chat happily as they give the corgis a bath while the @entity5 looks cheerful as she enjoys breakfast in bed			1
but while these might look like unusually candid snaps of the @entity12 , in reality , they are a clever spoof created by artist @entity14			1
inspired by next week 's @entity16 , @entity15 has tried to imagine how you might treat your mother when she happens to be the @entity5			0
giving the corgis a bath : @entity0 and @entity21 give the @entity5 's corgis a bath in a lurid pink bathroom and according to @entity15 , that means hosing down the corgis and carefully giving boiled eggs a regal makeover , complete with bearskin and crown covers			1
the next photo shows @entity0 and @entity21 , who , as a mother herself will be expecting some treats of her own next sunday , bathing the corgis in a vivid pink bathroom before drying them off with a patriotic @entity38 towel			2
amusingly , the royal couple are seen following the bath up with a blow dry , with @entity21 grimacing as prince @entity0 accidentally blows hot air in her face			1
next comes the big reveal , with the @entity5 looking thrilled as she is presented with her breakfast tray , a card that reads ' keep calm and reign on ' and three pots of the @entity49 's @entity48 moisture cream			0
anyone for a blowdry ? @entity0 ' poor aim leaves @entity21 needing to close her eyes a card fit for a queen : prince @entity0 is seen filling in a card that bears the slogan : ' keep calm and reign on ' decoration : @entity0 is also seen giving a trio of boiled eggs a regal makeover , complete with a crown finally , her majesty is seen sharing her toast soldiers and eggs with her freshly washed - and now very happy - corgis			1
@entity15 is no stranger to reinventing the @entity12 , having previously worked on ' photos ' of all the senior royals , including the @entity69 and @entity70 and prince @entity71			2
others to feature in her work include @entity75 , who was the subject of her @entity78 pastiche , which depicted miss @entity75 desperately attempting to wrap up a corgi for the @entity5			0
more risqu√© depictions of the @entity12 include a photo of the @entity1 on the treadmill clutching a gin and tonic and another of @entity21 , this time smoking a cigarette			2
doing the wrapping : a suited @entity0 and a dressing gowned @entity21 wrap up their gifts for the queen breakfast in bed : @entity5 , clad in a fetching green nightie , looks delighted as she is given her breakfast some for you too : the freshly washed corgis are then shown getting to share her majesty 's meal one particularly amusing set claims to go behind the scenes of @entity102 's @entity101 , with one photo showing the @entity5 looking horrified as her great grandson is sick on her			1
others show a nude @entity106 in the bath with @entity108 and another in which the @entity70 carefully changes her son 's nappy			0
