the @entity0 have promoted @entity1 to technical director with little or no fanfare considering the importance of the role within the structure of @entity9 football ’s ruling body			1
there was no official announcement of @entity1 ’s step up from director of elite development - his title since arriving from @entity15 in 2012			2
instead , @entity1 was first named technical director on the @entity0 website in the report on @entity18 extending his @entity9 under 21 contract			1
it is understood the @entity0 did not feel it necessary to promote the change of title as @entity1 has effectively been carrying out the technical director brief since the @entity25			1
@entity1 has been promoted to technical director of the @entity0 with very little fanfare or furore @entity1 ( left ) , pictured with @entity9 manager @entity29 at @entity30 in august 2013 and the @entity0 board had unanimously bought into his blueprint for the future organisation of @entity9 teams following his presentation as part of the postmortem into the @entity9 debacle in @entity40 also @entity0 chairman @entity41 had publicly anointed @entity1 as the technical director when outlining his second @entity9 commission report last october			1
@entity9 rugby ’s dysfunctional approach to fighting the secondary ticket market has resulted in @entity47 employing @entity48 as their official ticket supply partner only on condition their secondary sites @entity51 and @entity52 ! do not sell @entity25 tickets			0
yet @entity55 ! are trading @entity57 tickets for @entity9 games despite the @entity59 having had an agreement for them not to in previous years			0
@entity61 2015 have employed @entity48 as their official ticket supply partner for the @entity25 @entity63 , godfather of @entity65 corruption who took bribes from former marketing partners @entity68 , could reach his 100th birthday in may 2016 before @entity72 host the @entity73			1
but after @entity63 ’s long fall from grace , @entity73 organisers hope the stadium named after him , which will host the athletics , will henceforth be known as the @entity78 — even if @entity63 ’s discredited name remains on the signage			2
meanwhile , the relatively calm build - up to the @entity82 compared to the @entity40 @entity25 is being helped by the close relationship between the @entity84 and the local organising committee			0
@entity65 in contrast was regarded as an unwelcome foreign power			0
@entity63 , the godfather of @entity65 corruption , could reach his 100th birthday before @entity72 host the @entity73 @entity65 secretary - general @entity88 caused a furore when he said preparations needed a ‘ kick up the backside ’ , while @entity82 communications director @entity92 says : ‘ i do n’t think the @entity84 need to say so			1
’ the major problem with @entity82 venues remains the troublesome £ 15million golf course , which is built on ecologically sensitive land			1
after years of planning difficulties , grass has finally been sown			0
but 50 protesters are camped outside complaining about damage to the fragile environment			0
they want the course lay - out changed to protect endangered species but water systems are already in place			0
@entity106 bus rebate credit to @entity106 @entity109			2
they have reacted to horror stories — highlighted by @entity112 — about the official bus transport from @entity114 to @entity115 during the tournament last september by refunding media visitors £ 50 per night of their hotel stay as a goodwill gesture			1
@entity106 @entity109 have refunded media visitors £ 50 per night of their hotel stay after horror travel stories @entity109 retained the @entity106 at @entity115 in september , but some had problems travelling to the course the local drivers frequently got lost on the single road route and one even stopped his coach for half an hour on the way to the course because he had completed his allotted hours			1
@entity112 will be using @entity106 @entity109 ’s unprecedented action as a benchmark as to how event organisers should respond after poor service			2
@entity106 chief @entity136 said : ‘ if we get something wrong , we will put our hands up			0
’ the @entity141 summit in @entity142 on wednesday has attracted a number of the usual go - to suspects when it comes to needing a soundbite bashing @entity65			0
unfortunately this wholly worthwhile initiative of @entity149 mp @entity148 is not being attended by any representative of a @entity65 national football association — all fearful , no doubt , like the @entity0 , of giving the event extra credence by their presence			2
@entity148 said : ‘ we would like them to be there , and a lot of people in football support change , but do not have the courage of their convictions to speak out when it is vital to do so			0

@entity1 was promoted to technical director of @entity0 with no fanfare
@entity63 , godfather of @entity65 corruption , could reach his 100th birthday in may 2016 before @entity72 hosts the @entity73
after horror stories about travel , @entity106 @entity109 have refunded media visitors £ 50 per night of their hotel stay as a goodwill gesture
the major problem with @entity72 2016 venues remains the troublesome £ 15million golf course , but grass has finally been sown
