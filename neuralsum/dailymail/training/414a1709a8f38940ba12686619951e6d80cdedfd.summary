it is the hardest thing about being on a diet - depriving yourself of your favourite foods			0
now , one company claims to have come to the rescue - in the form of a low - calorie pizza			0
but before you get excited about carbs and cheese , bear in mind it 's a meal replacement - made by adding water to a sachet of powdered dough and sauce			1
and while it 's topped with vegetables , there is , sadly , no cheese			0
it is also said to be enriched with more than 22 vitamins and minerals plus added protein and is in line with recommendations of the @entity50 ( @entity50 )			0
and the secret to it being just 200 calories ? the dough is made from a vegetable protein and egg white and is topped with a tomato sauce containing soya and herbs			1
eaten in its entirety as meal , it provides a third of the recommended daily amount of vitamins and minerals			1
while cheese would n't be recommended for dieters , other suitable toppings include green peppers , mushrooms , tomatoes , spinach , red onions - food low in carbs and calories			1
@entity77 , managing director for the online weight - management company , @entity78 , said sales in weight - loss meal replacements have rocketed in the last two years			2
' dieters want products that fit into their busy lifestyles , ' he told @entity84			0
@entity39 diet ( per eight - inch pizza , dough and sauce ) calories 200 fat ( g ) 4.9 carbohydrates ( g ) 19.9 protein 17 leading brand calories 540 fat ( g ) 19 carbohydrates ( g ) 67 protein 14 ' they also want to enjoy meals with their families and our new diet pizza allows them to stay on track with their weight loss without feeling deprived			1
' and unlike many meal replacement foods , it does actually resemble real food , he adds			0
but is a meal replacement pizza really the answer , regardless of what it may taste like ? ' meal replacements used to get a really bad press , but they do have a role to play , ' dietitian @entity107 told @entity84			1
' most of them are required to have 200 - 400 calories by law and must contain an assortment of vitamins and minerals , added protein and fibre			2
' most people will lose weight if they cut down and will eat just 200 calories - and these meals are good for those who struggle with portion control			1
' but she fears any meal replacement paln may fails to educate slimmers in the long term - as they do n't learn how to eat ' real food '			2
' this means they may gain weight once they stop dieting , ' she explains			0
' on the plus side , the vegetable protein will be beneficial , and it will help dieters who feel they are missing out on " proper " food ' - providing it tastes ok			0

the @entity78 has *launched* the first ever meal - replacement pizza
diners add water to a sachet of powdered pizza dough and tomato sauce
an eight - inch pizza base and sauce contains 200 calories
this is *300* less than a regular thin crust base and tomato sauce
low fat toppings like vegetables are then added for *texture* and flavour
pizza is fortified with recommended daily amount of minerals and nutrients
but *experts* say meals like these do n't teach dieters about portion control
