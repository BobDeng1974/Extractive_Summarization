by @entity0 published : 04:16 est , 2 april 2013 updated : 08:04 est , 3 april 2013 they say you ca n't teach an old dog new tricks - but you can teach a sea lion to dance , scientists in @entity7 have proved			1
not only is @entity9 the sea lion thought to be the first non-human mammal capable of keeping a beat , she has also turned out to be something of a @entity14 fan			1
marine scientists successfully taught @entity9 to bob her head in time to music - a skill previously thought to exist only in animals capable of vocal mimicry , such as cockatoos , and parrots - including the boy band 's smash hit @entity25 )			1
she has also displayed a fondness for 1970s disco classics , particularly @entity45 by @entity33			0
scientists at the @entity47 , @entity47 , trained the three - year - old sea lion to move in time to a hand signal , which was later replaced by a simple , non-musical sound signal			1
@entity9 was rewarded with a fish everytime she bobbed her head to the varying rhythmic sounds			2
the team varied the type and speed of the sounds they used to confirm that @entity9 was actually following the beat			2
researchers used two computer - generated ticks - similar to a metronome - to establish that @entity9 was n't simply bobbing her head in response to the previous beat			2
@entity9 followed the beat even when a continuous metronome was replaced with one that skipped a beat , scientists said			0
@entity71 has a penchant for the @entity14 ' music ... bobbing : scientists at the @entity75 in @entity7 say their study may change our understanding of how rhythm is acquired the team then introduced @entity9 to musical ' dance ' lessons , starting her off with a simplified section of @entity85 by @entity86 , before introducing some pop into the mix with the @entity14 and @entity33			1
without any prior exposure to the tracks , @entity9 stunned scientists by bobbing to the beat of all of the songs over the course of multiple trials			2
the musically - inclined mammal could also keep time with five different tempos of @entity45 , according to the study , which was published yesterday in the @entity101 's @entity100			0
not only did @entity9 's bobbing skills improve markedly over the course of the trials , they have lasted beyond the experiment , with the sea lion passing follow - up tests a few weeks after the final session with flying colours			1
@entity108 , a doctoral candidate at the @entity109 at @entity47 , said : ' dancing is universal among humans , and until recently , it was thought to be unique to humans as well			0
' when some species of birds were found to have a similar capability for rhythmic movement , it was linked to their ability to mimic sound			0
now we 're seeing that even mammals with limited vocal ability can move in time with a beat over a broad range of sounds and tempos			0
' study co-author @entity127 , @entity128 , who is based at the @entity129 at @entity47 , said : ' understanding the cognitive capabilities of animals requires carefully controlled , well - designed experiments			0
' this study is particularly rigorous because it examines , step - by - step , the learning conditions that supported the emergence of this complex behaviour			0
' @entity108 : the doctoral candidate who led the study said it disproved the theory that dancing is unique to humans fan : the @entity14 ' track @entity25 ) is among @entity9 the sea lion 's favourites in 2011 footage of @entity152 the cockatoo bobbing up and down and shaking its feet to pop music swept the internet			1
the antics of the then 13 - year - old bird - which was seen grooving to tracks by the likes of @entity158 , @entity159 , and - just like @entity9 - the @entity14 - was hailed by scientists as proof that humans are not the only creatures with a sense of rhythm			2
while many animals had been known to respond to music , @entity152 was the first documented case of an animal with the ability to keep to a rhythm			0
@entity9 the sea lion was rescued from @entity172 in @entity173 , and now calls the university 's @entity175 and @entity176 home .			1

incredible footage shows @entity9 bobbing her head in time to music
sea lion is first non-human mammal capable of keeping a beat
