when @entity1 scored in the final of the @entity3 and the @entity4 in the same season last year , he did something for @entity6 that only @entity7 and @entity8 had managed before him			1
we can be fairly sure that no one ever tried to kick @entity8 ’ 1959 @entity11 180 as it pulled out of the club ’s training ground			0
the same can not be said for @entity1 ’s white @entity14 , which was attacked as he left @entity6 ’s @entity16 training complex in the early hours of monday morning after the @entity17			1
@entity1 has joined up with the @entity19 national team ahead of their upcoming match against @entity22 @entity1 's car was attacked by angry @entity6 fans following their 2 - 1 defeat by @entity26 on sunday the world 's most expensive footballer was confronted by fans as he left the club 's @entity16 training base the £ 86million signing 's white @entity14 is struck by this fan while others jeered @entity19 international @entity1 @entity1 has struggled to replicate the form he had shown during his first season at @entity6 @entity1 would not expect to have earned the same level of respect as the ‘ galloping major ’ , who won three @entity41 and scored 156 league goals in 180 games , but he has four trophies in his first year - and - a - half at the club , so the animosity he has encountered is impossible to justify and hard to understand			1
‘ he scored the winner in the @entity4 final ; he scored the winner in the @entity3 final			0
he is already a @entity6 legend , ’ gushed @entity6 sports daily @entity48 when @entity1 won the @entity3 in @entity49 last may			1
its rival publication in the @entity59 capital , @entity55 added : ‘ @entity60 and ( @entity61 ) @entity61 both scored afterwards but @entity1 ’s was the winner because it was game - over after that			1
’ those two publications have changed their tune 10 months on — dedicating pages to fan polls that call for the @entity70 to be dropped			2
on tuesday , 70 per cent of 8,000 supporters responding to one online survey said they wanted @entity1 left out of the team			1
there was no shortage of ammunition in the @entity6 press , with statistics such as ‘ he never set foot in the penalty area in the second half against @entity26 ’ and ‘ he only played seven passes after the break — just three more than @entity85 who came on three minutes from time ’			1
the fan tries to give the car a kick as @entity1 pulls away and the abuse continues to be thrown his way in @entity59 @entity1 and his @entity6 team - mates lost 2 - 1 at the @entity94 on sunday night in a fiercely - contested @entity17 an estimated 400 million people watched @entity1 struggle on television as @entity6 moved four points behind @entity26 following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of monday morning outside @entity101 , @entity6 wishes to outline the following : 1			1
@entity102 has already identified the individuals responsible , one a @entity6 member , for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players			2
details of this member 's identity were sent to the @entity111 , requesting that it expel the individual from @entity6 for what is considered a very serious offence			2
this afternoon , the @entity111 held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual 's rights as a member and access to the @entity122 or any @entity6 facilities			2
@entity6 has notified @entity59 's @entity124 of the incidents that took place , as well as the identities of the individuals responsible , requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate			2
furthermore , @entity6 will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents			2
all this supposedly supports the theory that @entity1 is in decline			0
but behind the numbers the story is a little more complicated than his critics care to admit			0
@entity1 came back to pre-season training in peak physical condition last summer and was comfortably the club ’s best player on the tour of the @entity143 , scoring in friendlies against @entity145 and @entity146			0
when @entity6 went on a run of 22 straight wins , @entity1 scored in the 5 - 1 win over @entity150 that began that hot streak , he got two in the next game that saw them beat @entity154 8 - 2 and netted again in the 5 - 1 win over @entity156 that followed			1
but a thigh injury suffered in october saw him miss three weeks of the season and in his absence @entity159 fielded a midfield quartet of @entity162 , @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			0
and that is where many of his current problems began			0
@entity1 has been criticised by @entity6 supporters despite winning four trophies since joining the club in 2013 @entity1 followed in the footsteps of former @entity6 duo @entity8 ( left ) and @entity7 by scoring in the final of the @entity3 and the @entity4 during the same season the @entity19 international took his anger out on a corner flag after netting a brace against @entity179 on march 15 @entity6 superstar @entity1 ( right ) will be hoping to lead @entity180 's @entity19 to @entity181 @entity19 , who are currently just one point behind @entity184 leaders @entity22 , need @entity1 to be firing on all cylinders the team kept winning and with the four passing midfielders the football resembled that played by @entity189 ’s @entity26 which many @entity6 followers had spent so long envying			1
the purists loved it and they also loved @entity165 ’s part in it — a @entity197 lad who felt like one of their own			0
@entity1 came back into the team and his part in the club ’s historic run picked up where it had left off , scoring in the 2 - 0 win over @entity206 that made @entity6 world club champions in december			1
but when the run came to an end in their next competitive game against @entity213 , the season began to unravel and he became the scapegoat			0
in the defeat by @entity213 he was blamed for squandering a late chance and ignoring @entity218 ’s screams for a pass			0
the idea that he should make way for @entity165 now went hand in hand with the theory that he was selfish			0
@entity61 did him no favours in the next game when he very publicly chastised him for shooting instead of passing late in a match against @entity227			0
‘ @entity231 ’ ( f * * * ! ) shouted the @entity228 throwing his arms down in disgust			0
@entity1 ’s every touch from there on in was whistled , despite the fact that he had scored direct from a free - kick earlier in the game — something that @entity61 has n’t done now in over 50 attempts			1
the under - current of competition between @entity1 and @entity61 is another factor			1
it is no secret that president @entity244 sees @entity1 as @entity61 ’s eventual successor both on the pitch as a match winner and off it as a big - money contract winner			1
cracks appear to be appearing in @entity1 's relationship with @entity6 team - mate @entity61 @entity1 and his girlfriend @entity251 must decide where their young daughter goes to school @entity61 is not enamoured with the idea of being replaced by anyone and , despite the fact @entity1 lives in the same luxury ‘ @entity261 ’ neighbourhood as @entity61 , there is not the closeness between the two that has developed at @entity26 between @entity263 and @entity264			1
when @entity61 threw a party for his 30th birthday , @entity1 was invited but did not attend — perhaps wisely , considering the fall - out that followed the festivities , coming as they did on the day of a 4 - 0 @entity271 defeat			2
@entity1 ’s partner @entity251 lives with him in @entity6 although , with a young daughter @entity275 not yet three years of age , frequent trips can be made back to @entity19			1
at some point in the future a decision will have to be made about schools			0
and he will need to be a sure that @entity6 is the right city to justify putting down deeper roots			0
he says he barely noticed the thugs who tried to kick his car as he drove away from the training ground at 1.30am on monday			0
but how long before the lack of respect from supporters , commentators and at times even team - mates begins to take its toll ? tuesday marked 10 months to the day since @entity6 won the @entity3 and @entity1 arrived back in the city at 4.30am to be greeted by an open - top bus that took him through streets filled with jubilant supporters			2
the @entity6 homecomings are not as pleasant as they used to be .			0
