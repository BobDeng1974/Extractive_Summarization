the ancient @entity1 legend of @entity2 and his @entity4 ' quest for the @entity5 may have been based on a real expedition to an ancient kingdom on the @entity8			1
geologists have uncovered evidence that a mountainous area of @entity12 in what is now northwest @entity14 was the country ‘ rich of gold ’ described in the legend			1
they claim that villagers that were part of the wealthy @entity20 , which existed from the sixth to the first centuries @entity22 , used sheepskin to capture gold from mountain streams in the area			0
among artifacts found in villages of @entity12 , northwest @entity14 was a bronze sculpture of a bird with a ram 's head that researchers say lends support that the myth of the golden fleece originated in the area the fleece was used to line the bottom of the sandy stream beds , trapping any tiny grains of gold that built up there			1
the technique is a variation on panning used elsewhere in the world			0
this , they say , would have lead to sheepskins that were imprinted with flakes of gold and could have given rise to stories of a golden fleece			2
historic artifacts , including a bronze sculpture of a bird with a ram 's head , that were found in the villages of @entity12 also lend support that the kingdom was the source of the myth			2
dr @entity66 , a geologist from the institute of earth sciences at the @entity69 , @entity14 , said the story of @entity2 and his @entity4 quest to find the @entity5 may have been a real event to learn about the sheepskin gold mining technique			1
the myth of @entity76 ' quest to the the ancient @entity20 to obtain the @entity5 has been a highly contentious subject among historians			1
the ancient @entity1 legend has several , often contradictory , accounts of the adventures of @entity2 and his argonauts on their ship the @entity84 in the years before the @entity85			1
it is described as a real story by @entity88 in his play @entity91			0
the @entity1 poet @entity93 of @entity94 also dedicates a poem to the voyage where he gives a detailed description of the @entity20			0
the ancient @entity99 philosopher @entity98 the @entity100 was among the first to provide a theory for what the @entity5 may have been , but many historians through the years have suggested that it could have been a sign of power , a sign of wealth , a book on alchemy , a particularly fine silk cloak or even simply a specially valuable breed of sheep			0
according to the @entity1 myth the @entity5 had belonged to a golden ram that @entity2 's ancestor @entity114 had flown east from @entity115 to the land of @entity117 , where @entity118 , son of the @entity119 , had sacrificed it			1
the fleece was then hung in a sacred grove belonging to the war god @entity123			0
@entity2 snuck in and stole the fleece			0
he said : ‘ the phenomena of the “ @entity5 ” , according to our research , is connected with the sheepskin technique of recovering placer gold ( gold that has built up in sand deposits )			2
‘ the end result of this technique of gold recovery river gravels was a gold imprinted sheepskin , giving rise to the romantic and unidentified phenomena of the “ @entity5 ” in the civilized world			1
‘ we think , from our investigations , that the bedrock and placer gold contents of this region give grounds to believe that there was enough gold in this region to describe @entity12 as “ the country rich of this noble metal ”			2
‘ we share the viewpoint of the @entity99 historian @entity152 and suppose that the myth about expedition of argonauts in quest of the “ @entity5 ” to the @entity20 was a real event and that the main purpose of this mission was to obtain gold and sheepskin technique of gold mining			1
’ dr @entity66 and colleagues from the @entity166 @entity165 in @entity14 , conducted a widespread survey of gold deposits in the @entity12 region			1
they report in the journal @entity172 that they used remote sensing and analysed more than 1,000 rock and gravel samples to assess the gold content in the area			0
they found that placer gold , where nuggets and flakes sink to the bottom of a stream bed , were extensively exposed throughout the time of the @entity20			0
although the @entity20 was named in the legend of @entity2 and his argonauts as the place where they stole the @entity5 , the exact location has always been disputed			2
some ancient sources , and modern academics , have said it could have belonged to the @entity195 people of @entity20 , whose territory was in the middle of the kingdom , but others have predicted it was the @entity200 who lived in the mountainous north			0
the @entity20 was a wealthy area in what is now modern @entity14 where according to @entity1 mythology @entity204 hung the @entity5 until it was seized by @entity76 according to @entity1 mythology @entity76 sailed in their ship the @entity84 from @entity115 to the @entity20 in search of the @entity5 as part of a quest to help @entity2 win the throne of @entity211 gold grains washed from the gravel stream bed of the @entity214 in @entity12			1
streams in the area are still panned by locals for gold , some of whom still use traditional methods that include sheepskin a unique golden lion sculpture from the beginning of the second millennium @entity22 is thought to show the sophisticated skill at obtaining and casting metal around the time when the @entity5 myth began they used remote sensing and analysed more than 1,000 rock and gravel samples to assess the gold content in the area			2
they found that placer gold , where nuggets and flakes sink to the bottom of a stream bed , were extensively exposed throughout the time of the @entity20			0
although the @entity20 was named in the legend of @entity2 and his argonauts as the place where they stole the @entity5 , the exact location has always been disputed			2
some ancient sources , and modern academics , have said it could have belonged to the @entity195 people of @entity20 , whose territory was in the middle of the kingdom , but others have predicted it was the @entity200 who lived in the mountainous north			0
dr @entity66 , however , points to golden artifacts found in the villages around @entity12 as evidence that they had sophisticated mining and meteorological skills			0
these include a unique golden lion sculpture that has been dated back to the second millennium @entity22 he said : ' this shows that gold mining and its artistic processing was at a very high level , very early in the history of the old @entity273 kingdoms			0
' our work shows that the gold content in the rivers sands of this region are sufficiently large to give grounds for the creation of legends			0
' @entity12 sits beneath the main ridge of the @entity284 mountains in northwest @entity14 where streams still run rich with gold deposits according to the analysis by geologists surveys by the geologists show that gold ore veins ( marked with orange ovals ) and stream beds that contain rich gold deposits ( marked with yellow ovals ) exist today and have been replenished after historical mining geological surveys by dr @entity66 and his team reveal that gold deposits in many areas that were historically mined have been replenished as streams have continued to wash them down the mountainsides			1
indeed , he said that some locals still use traditional techniques to obtain gold from the rivers in the area and it may even be possible for modern day @entity76 to find a golden fleece of their own today			1
he said : ‘ our work has confirmed that @entity12 is a region , uniquely , where the locals still wash gold from alluvial placers through modern domestic , wooden vessels or pans with holes in the bottom and unto a sheepskin or fleece which collects the fine particulate gold			1

ancient villagers used sheepskins to line stream beds in the @entity12 region of the @entity326 in northwest @entity14
gold flakes became ingrained on the fleeces , which scientists believe led to the rise of the myth surrounding the @entity5
adventures of @entity2 and his argonauts may have been based on a real journey to obtain the *secrets* of this technique for *extracting* gold
scientists say that modern day @entity4 may even still be able to find @entity342 of their own today as locals continue the tradition
