@entity0 has unveiled a massive military spending plan that will see it splash out more than £ 10billion on a fleet of new warships and submarines			1
the country , which has received £ 1.6billion in aid from @entity7 in the past eight years , will bolster its navy by building seven frigates at a cost of £ 5.2billion			1
a further £ 5.2billion will be spent on six nuclear - powered submarines			1
@entity7 is stopping its handouts , totalling around £ 210million this year , from the end of this december			2
but many more millions will head towards @entity29 in the form of private sector expertise and technical assistance			0
@entity0 ’s government has cleared the plan to build its most advanced warships only months after making its order for new submarines in october			1
the orders are part of a plan to try to close the gap with the @entity20 navy in the @entity43			1
since taking over last year , prime minister @entity14 has signalled his resolve to build a strong military following claims the country would be unable to fight a two - front war against @entity20 and @entity21			1
the decision to bolster @entity0 ’s navy comes after it has been rattled in recent months by the presence of @entity20 submarines docked in @entity52 , just off its southern coast			1
the @entity43 frigates , which are being made in a programme called @entity56 , will be built at the government shipyards in @entity58 and @entity59			0
there has been growing anger from @entity63 backbenchers over spending on @entity7 ’s aid budget at a time when public services are being slashed in the @entity7			1
@entity63 mp @entity67 said last night : ‘ this is why we should not be giving any aid to @entity0			2
it was not aid that brought @entity0 out of poverty but trade			2
aid is just a sticking plaster			0
’ @entity78 , @entity63 mp for @entity79 , said : ‘ it is clear that @entity0 is becoming a wealthy country if it is able to spend such a colossal amount on its military			1
‘ there is absolutely no justification for @entity86 [ the @entity86 ] to now be spending any money on @entity0			1
security : the frigates , which are being made in a programme called @entity56 , will be built at government shipyards in @entity58 and @entity59 ‘ it ’s a pity it ’s taken this long to put a stop to it , but at least the decision has now been taken			2
’ in 2012 the government announced the current eight - year £ 1.6billion aid package running until the end of this year would be the last			0
the amount of aid to @entity0 will reduce to £ 35.1million by 2016/2017			2
the decision came after @entity0 ’s finance minister @entity102 told the @entity43 parliament : ‘ we do not require the aid			1
it is a peanut in our total development spending			0
’ @entity107 , the international development secretary , said : ‘ it is time to recognise @entity0 ’s changing place in the world			0
‘ after reviewing the programme and holding discussions with the government of @entity0 , we agreed that now is the time to move to a relationship focusing on skill sharing rather than aid			0
’ in reply , @entity0 ’s foreign minister , @entity118 , said : ‘ aid is the past and trade is the future			2
’ earlier this month , a major report warned that @entity7 ’s foreign aid budget has been increased so quickly that ministers and officials were ‘ struggling ’ to spend it properly			0
it found that they were ‘ unprepared ’ for the challenge of spending a 30 per cent increase in the budget last year			0
the increase followed @entity135 ’s controversial pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of the @entity7 ’s income on foreign aid			0
in a devastating conclusion , the @entity138 said there was only ‘ limited evidence ’ that the money made a real difference in the world ’s poorest countries			0
in some cases it may even have made problems worse .			0

country will bolster navy with seven frigates and six nuclear submarines
@entity155 say its *lavish* spending shows @entity7 should stop ' *dolling* ' it money
@entity0 's new prime minister @entity14 wants to build a strong military
he fears country not *equipped* for two - front war with @entity21 and @entity20
