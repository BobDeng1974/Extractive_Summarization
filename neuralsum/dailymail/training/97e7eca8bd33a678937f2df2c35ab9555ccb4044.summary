president @entity2 was not made aware of the harsh interrogation techniques that the @entity4 was using on terrorism detainees until four years after it first began using the tactics , a report released today by the @entity1 revealed			1
and even after @entity2 was informed by the government agency of the program , the @entity4 kept from the president the extent of the program 's cruelty and ineffectiveness at obtaining reliable information , the 500 - page document said			1
other cabinet - level officials , including secretary of state @entity17 and vice president @entity18 , were also kept in the dark for some time , according to the report			1
@entity22 officials who did have knowledge of the @entity4 's actions were concerned that @entity17 ' would blow his stack , ' one email published by the @entity1 committee shows , so he was not told immediately			1
former president @entity2 is pictured here with then - vice president @entity18 , right , and then - secretary of state @entity17 , left , during a september , 2001 cabinet meeting			1
a @entity1 report released today on the @entity4 's interrogation tactics during the @entity2 administration revealed that neither @entity2 nor members of his cabinet knew about the government agency 's actions when they first began ' the @entity4 provided extensive amounts of inaccurate and incomplete information related to the operation and effectiveness of the @entity4 's @entity42 to the @entity22 , the @entity44 principals , and their staffs , ' an executive summary of the intelligence committee 's report states			1
' this prevented an accurate and complete understanding of the program by @entity52 officials , thereby impeding oversight and decision - making			0
' it goes on to say that ' specific questions from @entity22 officials were not answered truthfully or fully ' by the @entity4 and that the government agency misled the @entity44 so it could continue using the questionable tactics , arguing that ' [ t ] ermination of this program will result in loss of life , possibly extensive			0
' the redacted document , based on a 6,700 page classified report , asserts that @entity4 records show that @entity2 was not briefed by the agency on the techniques , which @entity69 say amounted to torture at times , until april of 2006			2
at that point , the study found that 38 of the 39 terrorism suspects who were mistreated had already been interrogated by the @entity4 , as the expanded interrogation program had already been underway since 2002			2
furthermore , at the direction of top @entity22 officials , then - secretary of state @entity17 and then - defense secretary @entity79 were not told of the program until september of 2003 , despite being key members of the president 's national security team			1
@entity18 and then - national security adviser @entity84 , who would later lead the @entity85 under @entity2 , were not informed until sometime after that , and they too did not receive complete information about the program			2
according to the @entity1 report : ' an internal @entity4 email from july 2003 noted that " ... the @entity22 [ @entity22 ] is extremely concerned [ secretary ] @entity17 would blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what 's been going on			2
" ' vice president @entity18 , left , @entity17 , center left , and national security advisor @entity84 , right , pictured here in the @entity95 with the president on april 18 , 2002 , learned of the @entity4 program sometime after the first year			1
president @entity2 , center right , was n't told until 2006 , the @entity1 report claims the email , sent from the @entity4 's acting general counsel , @entity101 , did not say who from @entity22 had instructed him to keep quiet , only that @entity22 officials were concerned that dissemination of information to cabinet officials would result in leaks to the media			1
deputy secretary of state @entity109 would later complain that that he and @entity17 were ' cut out ' of key national security decisions as a result , it said			0
neither the vice president nor the president were ever told of the exact locations of the @entity4 's overseas black sites at which they carry out the interrogation , which created a diplomatic snafu for @entity18 once , @entity69 aides who spoke with @entity122 said			1
roughly five months after learning of the methods being employed by the @entity4 president @entity2 acknowledged in a sept. 6 , 2006 speech that the agency had used an ' alternative set of procedures ' to interrogate detainees			2
the speech was vetted by the @entity4 , however , the @entity1 's report says , and based on the inaccurate information provided by the @entity4			0
thus @entity2 overplayed the significance of information acquired from detainees and the effectiveness of the @entity4 's interrogation techniques			1
according to the report , at one point @entity138 instructed the @entity4 not to fully brief the president on the water boarding techniques the agency was using			0
the aides who spoke with @entity145 said that once @entity2 learned the truth about some of the measures the @entity4 had taken , he was ' uncomfortable ' with their actions			0
in a recent interview with @entity151 , @entity2 did not address rumors that the report would absolve him of involvement in the @entity4 's program nor did he shed any light on his knowledge of the agency 's actions			2
' here ’s what i ’m going to say , that we ’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the @entity4 serving on our behalf , ' @entity2 told @entity151 host @entity167 , after noting that he had n't yet seen the yet - to - be released @entity1 report			1
and whatever the report says , if it diminishes their contributions to our country , it is way off base , ' he added			0
' i knew the directors , i knew the deputy directors , i knew a lot of operators - these are good people			0
and we ’re lucky as a nation to have them			0
' former vice president @entity18 , a vocal proponent of the program , told the @entity185 that he had not yet been briefed on the report , either			1
nevertheless , he told the news publication on monday that the information he had received led him to believe that the @entity4 would be characterized inaccurately in the @entity1 's study			2
' what i keep hearing out there is they portray this as a rogue operation and the agency was way out of bounds and then they lied about it , ' he told the @entity185			0
' i think that ’s all a bunch of hooey			0
the agency did not want to proceed without authorization , and it was also reviewed legally by the @entity206 before they undertook the program , ' he claimed			0
the @entity1 report , five and a half years in the making , also claims that the @entity4 fed @entity206 lies , as well , though			0
in at least one instance , the paper says , the @entity4 assured @entity206 that the medical care of a detainee , @entity214 , who sustained a bullet wound during his capture would be put first			0
it then told its own staff that the interrogation of the combatant should take ' precedence ' over his medical needs			0
the @entity4 released a statement refuting key findings of the @entity1 's study today , including the claim that @entity2 was not briefed on the true nature of its actions until midway through his second term			1
' while the @entity232 records on the subject are admittedly incomplete , former president @entity2 has stated in his autobiography that he discussed the program , including its use of enhanced techniques , with then - [ @entity238 in 2002 , prior to the application of the techniques on @entity214 , and personally approved the techniques , ' it said .			2

@entity4 began using harsh interrogation techniques in 2002 ; @entity2 was not told until 2006 , @entity1 study revealed
dven after @entity2 was informed , the @entity4 kept from the president the extent of the program 's cruelty and ineffectiveness
other cabinet - level officials , including secretary of state @entity17 and vice president @entity18 , were also kept in the dark for some time
@entity4 *disputed* claims about @entity2 today pointing out that in his autobiography , the former president said he knew about the tactics in 2002
