they 're known for their love of sleep , so tit 's not surprising this koala was far from happy when it was rudely awakened with a drenching from a garden sprinkler			1
the furry creature , which rests for up to 18 hours a day , was fast asleep in a tree when it was soaked by a gardener watering his trees			1
and as these images show , the koala was more than a little peeved at its unexpected soaking			2
a wet wake - up call : this koala looks far from happy after being woken up from a nap when a gardener drenched it while watering his trees in @entity21 , @entity22 the images were taken by @entity24 , 39 , in the garden of his home in @entity21 , @entity22			1
he said : ' there was a particular bad heatwave in @entity21 recently and temperatures reached up to @entity30			0
' the koalas hang around in a tree in my garden when it is hot , it 's on the southern side of the house and relatively cool			0
" we use the sprinklers and garden hose to wet the house and surrounding trees when it 's hot to avoid a bush fire but when i watered one of the trees , this koala got a bit of a soaking			2
' but while the koala may look far from happy about his soaking , mr @entity24 said it would have helped it cool off			2
he said : ' it was a boiling hot day so i 'm sure it helped the koala cool down			0
cooling off : but @entity24 , 39 , who took the photographs of the animal , said the koala may have appreciated the soaking as it was an unusually hot day ' koalas usually do n't need to drink , as they get their moisture requirements from gum leaves but on that day , the koala 's were licking at the trunk of the tree where the water was trickling down			1
' after accidentally drenching the animal , mr @entity24 quickly grabbed his camera before heading to the end of his garden to take these pictures			1
' i wanted to use my camera to try and get a shot of the koala after wetting it down , so walked down and proceeded to snap away			0
' either the koala was curious , or wanted to thank me , as it climbed out along the tree branch and stayed at the end of it just looking at me			0
it even stuck its tongue out which helped me get some great photos			0
