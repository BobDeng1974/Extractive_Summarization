by @entity0 @entity2 science teacher @entity1 has been terminated after an experiment left two students badly injured with burns and lacerations a science teacher has been fired after an experiment he conducted in class caused a glass jar to explode leaving two students badly injured with burns and lacerations			1
@entity14 administrator @entity13 said teacher @entity1 , 49 , had been terminated following the march incident which injured two boys aged between 16 and 17			1
mr @entity1 said he made a ' mistake ' in conducting the experiment but said the environment in the lab was ' very dangerous '			1
the experiment carried out during a @entity22 and 12 chemistry lesson involved pupils lighting oxygen in a glass jar on fire			1
the glass has previously contained liquefied natural gas and this created a ' very powerful explosion ' which severed the tendons in one student 's hand			2
' they 've been treated and they 're coping well but obviously [ one student ] needs some support in terms of school work because he ca n't use his hand , ' mr @entity13 said			0
mr @entity13 said experts independent from the school in @entity44 , @entity2 concluded that the experiment should not have been conducted			1
' the experiment was n't curriculum based , it was n't from a text book , ' he said			1
' it should n't have been conducted in any shape or form			0
' the students were practicing writing lab reports and there were a range of curriculum - based experiments that could have been carried out instead of the oxygen experiment , mr @entity13 said			1
' gases should n't be lit in glass jars full stop unless it 's a beaker , ' he said			2
the incident occurred at @entity14 ( pictured ) in march during a class 11 and 12 chemistry lesson ' the whole experiment was wrong it should n't have been done full stop			2
' it was believed the lng had been burned out			0
that was n't confirmed so when oxygen was added it combusted			0
' if it had been confirmed @entity69 was n't in there it would n't have been a problem			0
' [ in a school newsletter issued to parents on may 1 mr @entity13 said the boys ' recovery will be long term			2
' their recovery … will involve permanent scars and for one student it may involve further operations to ensure he has full movement of his hand , ' he wrote			0
' as these two boys are in @entity88 and going through the intensity of that year – class 12 project deadlines as well as normal class work and exams are looming - being injured in this way has created much stress for them and their families			2
' mr @entity1 told @entity96 he made a mistake in conducting the experiment			1
the experiment involved pupils lighting oxygen in a glass jar on fire ' i 'm not denying i did a mistake by over-challenging the students , i should have just worked with limited equipment i had , ' he said			1
' the sequence of burning a gas and burning another gas should not have happened in that way			0
' but he said the lab was disorganised and ' something would have happened eventually anyways '			0
' the whole environment in that school , in the lab was very dangerous , ' he said			2
mr @entity1 said strong acids and bases were left in places where they were accessible by students			1
' i made management aware of the fact that that needs to be locked away , ' he said			0
' that was just in cabinets in the classroom so any student could have opened it			0
' mr @entity1 also said the lab technician was overworked and did not organise experiments , there was no curriculum and no text books			1
@entity14 administrator @entity136 said the experiment was not curriculum - based and should not have been conducted ' i have to say about waldorf school there is no set curriculum per se , ' he said			1
' the advice i was given , i had to follow a @entity144 chemist [ @entity145 ] @entity143 , he is very popular with the @entity146			0
' @entity14 is a @entity146 , which places emphasis on the whole development of the child — spiritual , physical , moral and academic			2
mr @entity1 said it was ' absolutely not fair ' that the blame for the incident was placed solely on him			1
' of course i let down the team in a certain way but the team let me down at the same time , ' he said			0
' i 've done a mistake in a team where there were a lot of mistakes being done , just one of many mistakes being done at that school , at the particular department and my one blew up			0
' mr @entity1 added that he had been in contact with the boy with severed tendons			1
' there is no hard feelings whatsoever , not of the parents , not of that boy , ' he said			0
mr @entity1 said he made a ' mistake ' in conducting the experiment but said the environment in the lab was ' very dangerous ' ' he is of the opinion that accidents happen			1
' of course i feel for the boys , i feel greatly for those boys , i 'm really , really sorry they got injured			2
' mr @entity13 rejected mr @entity1 's claim the lab was unsafe			1
' that had nothing to do with running an inappropriate experiment , ' he said			0
' the school had n't been told by the teacher there were any issues from the lab. ' mr @entity13 said the school ' did not accept the claims being made by mr @entity1 ' , based on the extensive investigation conducted by the school into the incident			1
' the investigation saw no link between the resources provided at the school and the experiment conducted by the teacher , ' he said			2
' the school sees these alleged claims as spurious			0
' the school has sucessfully conducted a well run chemistry and science program for many years without incident and the resources , where requested , have always been provided in a timely manner			0
' the school 's primary concern has and always will be the safety and wellbeing of the students			0
