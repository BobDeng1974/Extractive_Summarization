it is furniture befitting the most prestigious seat of learning			0
but a university ’s plans to pay £ 150,000 for a set of seven hand - crafted chairs have left staff in a fury			2
@entity10 has commissioned luxury furniture maker @entity11 to create the three - legged seats for use in graduation ceremonies			1
they are meant to be seen as symbols of success , although as yet it is unclear exactly who would be sitting on them			0
the chairs , which cost a total of £ 150,000 , are to be used during graduation ceremonies ( file picture ) a senior university source said the total price tag stands at £ 150,000 – a quarter of the total £ 600,000 budget for this year ’s graduation programme			1
@entity29 of the @entity31 teaching union said the decision was a mistake at a time when staff were being laid off			2
‘ splashing out £ 150,000 on seven chairs really is quite extraordinary , ’ he said			0
‘ it is even more incredible when you consider that financial problems have been given as a reason for job cuts			0
‘ if the university needs to save money it should look at its travel and expenses bills and cut down on chairs			2
‘ anyone who thinks chairs are a symbol of success is more out of touch than we feared and should probably not be running a university			2
a successful university is one where students receive a quality education from well - supported staff – chairs simply do n’t come into it			1
’ students condemned the decision , one tweeting : ‘ @entity10 spend £ 150,000 on seven chairs ... not professorial “ chairs ”			1
’ deputy vice-chancellor @entity66 said the commissioning process was ongoing and the university planned to pay for the chairs through private donations and charitable foundations			1
professor @entity71 was warned in a series of emails between senior staff members that it would be damaging to the university ’s reputation if the price was made public			0
but he said in the emails that he was keen to push ahead , saying the chairs would be ‘ a symbol of success ’			0
he added : ‘ if there is any disquiet , i am more than confident time will judge this to have been a great decision			1
’ he said the chairs followed the commissioning of ceremonial robes and a mace and the granting of a coat of arms .			0

the chairs will be used during graduation ceremonies at @entity10
students condemned the *extravagant* *purchase* as ' mad '
the university *'s* deputy chief says *buying* the chairs was a ' great decision '
