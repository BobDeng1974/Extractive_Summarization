@entity1 captain @entity0 warned his side were yet to play their perfect game in the @entity5 , despite booking their spot in sunday 's final with a 95 - run victory over defending champions @entity10			1
@entity11 clocked his first @entity5 century on thursday , his 105 off just 93 balls propelling @entity1 to 328 for seven , with opener @entity13 kicking on to 81 after a slow start			1
it meant @entity10 's run - chase was under pressure from the start , and , barring skipper @entity20 's run - a - ball 65 , @entity1 had a relatively easy route to the finish line and now have the chance for a fifth @entity5 title when they face co-hosts @entity26			1
@entity0 and his @entity1 team - mates celebrate during their @entity5 victory over @entity10 on thursday @entity0 shakes hand with @entity32 players after the 95 - run win that saw @entity1 progress to the final @entity36 celebrates after taking the wicket of @entity10 's @entity38 at the @entity39 the @entity26 are the only unbeaten team of the tournament so far , having trumped @entity1 as well in the pool stages , but @entity0 said on @entity42 : ' we 're playing some really good cricket at the moment			1
' losing to @entity26 gave us that kick up the backside			1
i still do n't think we 've played the perfect game yet			2
i think we 've improved every game and now we 're excited to be in the final			1
' i think the boys have played some outstanding cricket			2
@entity54 was exceptional once again			2
he 's hitting the ball so sweetly , and i 'm really proud of the execution under pressure there from our bowlers			2
' @entity11 's century comes in a tournament that has already seen him make scores of 95 , 72 and 65 , and the stand - in test captain hopes there is plenty left in the bag for sunday			1
' another big hundred would be nice , ' he said			0
' it 's nice to contribute to a few wins			0
it was a pretty big stage , the semi-final of a @entity5			1
i 'm just happy that we got over the line in the end			0
' @entity11 plays a fine shot on his way to a 100 against @entity10 in the @entity5 semi-final the all - rounder raises his bat to a bumper crowd after reaching his century on thursday @entity20 , meanwhile , feels his side can walk away with their heads held high after a @entity5 that belied many pre-tournament expectations			1
@entity10 came into the showpiece on the back of a disappointing tour of @entity1 , with no competitive wins to their name , but marched to the knockout phase by topping their pool and then easily beat @entity96			1
' overall , i 'm quite happy , ' @entity20 said			0
' where we were at the start of the tournament , a lot of people did n't think we 'd get this far			0
' at the same time , when you come to the knockout stages you have to lift your game			0
' there were too many ( runs ) to chase			2
if you lose quite a few wickets and you 're supposed to chase over six runs an over ... our lower order , i do n't think they can contribute as much in these conditions			2
' overall , it 's good exposure for them			0
maybe next time , in other conditions , they 'll know how to bat and do better			0
' @entity20 was undecided when asked after the match whether this would be his last @entity5			1
' i 'm not sure about that , ' he said			0
' i 'm 33 , i 'm still running , i 'm still fit			0
' but i 'll have a ( think in a ) year 's time			0
maybe next year during the @entity124 i would like to decide if i can continue until the @entity125 or not			0
