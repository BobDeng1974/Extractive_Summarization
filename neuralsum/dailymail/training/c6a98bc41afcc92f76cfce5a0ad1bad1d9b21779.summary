in the time since mr @entity3 ’s horrific death , which was caught on camera and witnessed by dozens of commuters on the busy subway station at @entity104 , the question has been asked again and again : ‘ why did nobody help ? ’ the photo of mr @entity3 's last moments , captured by freelance @entity3 photographer @entity108 , have sparked outrage and prompted criticism of both mr @entity108 for not helping and the paper for plastering the image on their front page			1

they have been staying in my house and it has been very difficult , very difficult to see them ( like this )			0

he was always there for me			0
’ neither woman addressed the reports that had surfaced earlier suggesting that mr @entity3 and his wife had argued in the hours before he left home for the last time			1
or that she had called him begging him to come home			0
what is clear is that mr @entity3 was a hardworking man who had fallen on difficult times			2
mr @entity3 was a successful businessman in @entity145 who came to @entity7 25 years ago in the hope of providing a better life for his future wife and child			2

' nothing he could do ' : @entity3 photographer @entity180 appeared on the today show to defend himself and claim he could not have saved mr @entity3 adding to the stress , a disability rendered his wife unable to work , making him more determined to find a job			1

mr @entity134 said : ‘ he worked hard to provide food , shelter and clothing for his family and in the end his life was taken so senselessly ’			0
there is some small comfort in the fact that an arrest has been made but , for the family , their focus falls not on retribution or punishment of the perpetrator but on the grief that his apparently mindless act has inflicted			0
@entity187 said , ‘ we weep over the passing of mr @entity3 who was a devoted father of @entity18 and husband of @entity226			1
’ a community fund has been established to assist the family with funeral costs , medical care and @entity18 ’s continued study			2
