by @entity0 published : 17:28 est , 24 october 2013 updated : 18:30 est , 24 october 2013 the archbishop of @entity3 says he has no objection to @entity5 converting to @entity6			1
the most reverend @entity10 , speaking one day after he led the christening of the future @entity9 , said the prince is ‘ perfectly entitled ’ to change his religion should he so choose			1
the remark is likely to alarm traditionalists			1
however , it is in keeping with prince @entity17 ’s oft - repeated claim that he wants to be seen as ‘ @entity18 ’ instead of ‘ @entity19 ’ , to reflect @entity21 ’s multicultural society			1
the most reverend @entity10 , ( right ) who led @entity5 's christening , said he has no objection to him converting to @entity6 the archbishop of @entity3 chose to urge @entity25 's parents and godparents to help the future monarch ( pictured in the official portrait at @entity29 ) to ' make sure he knows who @entity30 is ' the archbishop was asked by @entity33 what his reaction would be if @entity25 , the third in line to the throne , wanted to leave the @entity38 to become a @entity39			1
he replied : ‘ he ’s perfectly entitled to be that , and we ’ll cross that bridge if we ever get to it			1
who knows ? ’ the remarkable statement came just 24 hours after he conducted the young prince ’s christening at the @entity48 in @entity49			1
indeed , the archbishop had chosen in his address to urge @entity25 ’s parents and godparents to help the future monarch ‘ make sure he knows who @entity30 is ’ , imploring : ‘ speak of him , read stories about him			1
’ his latest comments will concern many within the @entity38 , who consider the archbishop to be a leader who seeks to be ‘ all things to all men ’			2
the archbishop 's comments will concern many within the @entity38 , who consider him a leader who seeks to be ' all things to all men ' he made the comments to @entity33 when asked his reaction if @entity25 , wanted to leave the @entity38 prince @entity17 has already caused controversy within the @entity72 by floating the idea that he could adapt his future title to embrace other religions			1
the prince , who has a particular fascination with @entity78 , believes that by calling himself @entity79 he will unite the different strands of society at his @entity82			2
earlier this year the @entity83 told how prince @entity84 is not a regular churchgoer			2
although the 31 - year - old future king was confirmed into the @entity72 faith in 1997 , he is understood to attend services of worship just a ‘ handful ’ of times each year			0
most of these are linked with official engagements or come on special occasions in the @entity96 calendar such as @entity97 , or social occasions such as weddings and christenings			0
sources say @entity84 and his wife ‘ rarely , if ever ’ go to church privately on a sunday morning , or at any other time			0
a senior aide admitted : ‘ i ’m not aware that he goes every week			0
’ while @entity84 is not alone in failing to attend – barely 8 per cent of those who go to church regularly are men of a similar age – his stance is in strong contrast to other members of the @entity113			0
the queen is a devout @entity96 with a deep sense of religious duty , who attends @entity38 on a weekly basis the queen is a devout @entity96 with a deep sense of religious duty , who attends @entity38 on a weekly basis			0
and for all his much - publicised interest in other faiths , prince @entity17 is also a regular churchgoer			2
a spokesman for the @entity17 said he frequently attended sunday service at a church close to @entity129 , his @entity130 residence , as well as in @entity131 and @entity132			0
prince @entity17 said he may be known as @entity18 after he becomes king the monarchy has a unique relationship with the @entity72			2
the sovereign holds the title ‘ defender of @entity139 and @entity9 ’			0
the monarch has been known by the title @entity19 ever since it was bestowed on @entity142 by the @entity143 in 1521 for his early support for @entity145			1
any change would , however , require @entity147 to amend the 1953 @entity148 , which came into law after changes were made for the @entity82 in the same year			2
in his or her coronation oath the monarch also promises to maintain the @entity38 – a vow that the present @entity119 takes very seriously			0
archbishops and bishops are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister , who in turn considers the names selected by a @entity162			0
they in turn take an oath of allegiance to @entity119 on appointment – as do parish priests – and may not resign without receiving royal authority			0
the archbishop of @entity3 has courted controversy before , notably for describing the naming and shaming of bankers in the wake of the financial crisis as ‘ lynch - mobbish ’			1
in july the former oil executive said it was wrong to single out bankers for causing the worst recession for generations .			0

archbishop of @entity3 said would not object to the prince converting
most reverend @entity10 spoke a day after he led the christening
@entity25 ' perfectly entitled ' to change his religion
