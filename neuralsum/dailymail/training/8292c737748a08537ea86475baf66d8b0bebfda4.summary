by @entity0 published : 18:55 est , 2 october 2013 updated : 02:33 est , 3 october 2013 the @entity1 is still receiving calls from victims of @entity4 a year on from the tv documentary which exposed the serial paedophile ’s reign of terror			1
police say there the former @entity11 broadcaster abused at least 1,300 people over 54 years - but the children ’s charity said more were still coming forward			1
the charity revealed that publicity over the scandal has led to an overall surge in the number of child victims of sexual abuse and rape contacting the @entity1			1
shocking figures : police believe @entity4 abused at least 1,300 people over 54 years while children 's charity @entity1 says more victims are still coming forward over the past year , the number of referrals from the charity ’s helpline to police and social services has almost doubled - up 84 per cent - in response to publicity surrounding the scandal			1
in june and july this year , almost 600 calls were referred - up from 323 over the same two months the year before			0
the chief executive of the @entity1 hailed the increase , saying it showed that the @entity41 scandal was encouraging victims to come forward after years of silence			1
but @entity44 warned that , unless the country does more to step in sooner , we could find that another @entity4 has long been in our midst going unpunished			2
he said the @entity48 scandal had served to push the problem of child abuse up the news agenda			2
‘ police now believe there could be up to 1,300 victims , some as young as five			1
incredibly , calls from people saying they were abused by @entity4 are still being taken by the @entity1 to this day , ’ he said			1
‘ and as the media has followed the narrative and focused on some of the darkness beneath this upturned stone , we have seen more and more stories of child abuse punctuating the headlines			2
the @entity1 believes the publicity surrounding the @entity4 scandal has pushed child abuse up the news agenda and has helped encourage victims to come forward after years of silence ‘ from grooming gang scandals and unfolding revelations surrounding other celebrities , to care home abuse in @entity72 , the spotlight has continued to highlight increasingly scandalous evidence of child mistreatment which 21st century @entity75 hoped it had left behind long ago			1
’ mr @entity44 said fewer people now believed that lots of sex accusations are false , or that young girls were ‘ asking for it ’ or were predatory groupies			0
‘ it ’s good that people now seem far more willing to take action , to pick up the phone in an effort to secure justice , ’ he said			0
‘ we ’ve seen a huge surge in calls to the @entity1 about a whole range of abuse which continues to this day , a full year later			1
‘ there has been an 84 per cent increase in referrals about sexual abuse from our helpline to police and social services			1
each referral is a child protected so thousands of additional children have been safeguarded by calls to the @entity1 alone			1
chief executive of the @entity1 , @entity44 , pictured , warned more must be done to stop another @entity48 developing into a sex offender ‘ there has been a 77 per cent increase in reporting of child rape and serious sexual assault in @entity111 and a 23 per cent increase in reporting of adult rape			1
‘ this is n’t because more people are being abused , raped or assaulted , it ’s because more of the majority who do n’t speak out now feel more confident about doing so			2
’ mr @entity44 praised the police and the court service for making it easier for potential victims to come forward and cope with the ordeal of a trial			2
‘ i sense a change in attitudes , ’ he said			0
‘ people will no longer say that something just happened and there is n’t much you can do			0
‘ people are prepared to challenge injustice no matter how powerful the perpetrator is			0
if we can see major celebrities like @entity138 go to jail , then no sex offender should feel safe			0
‘ but we are not there yet			0
sadly we still live in a society where some well - educated , influential people think that a drunk girl who is raped is “ partly to blame ” for what happened to her			0
’ the @entity1 boss said society had to do more to stop abuse before it starts - rather than just reacting when harm is done			2
‘ we have to stop another @entity48 developing into a sex offender in the first place and , if he does , stop him after his first attack not his 500th , ’ he said			0
‘ to do this , we have to make child abuse everybody ’s business			0
and we must maintain the pressure on our politicians even when the headlines are a distant memory			0
‘ the time is right for change ; in fact it may be a once in a generation opportunity			0
if we do n’t grasp it with both hands we may find , in years to come , another @entity4 has been living amongst us			2
