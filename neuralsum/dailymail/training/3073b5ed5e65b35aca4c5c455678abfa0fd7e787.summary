by @entity0 @entity2 fans and foes need not rush to the store tomorrow morning to buy the former secretary of state 's book @entity7 , readers who obtained early copies say			1
the juicy sections of the book have already been leaked , and book is overall ' a newsless snore , ' @entity11 's @entity10 said today in his morning newsletter			1
hard choices was ' written so carefully not to offend that it will fuel the notion that politics infuses every part of her life , ' @entity10 said			0
' in this book , like in " the @entity25 ” theme song , everyone is awesome ! ' @entity2 's soon - to - be released book @entity7 is getting bad reviews at one point in the book , @entity31 , a likely 2016 presidential candidate , discusses criticism and notes that , ' your critics can actually teach you lessons your friends ca n’t or wo n’t			1
' ' i try to sort out the motivation for criticism whether partisan , ideological , commercial , or sexist , analyze it to see what i might learn from it , and discard the rest			0
' what @entity31 ought to take away from criticism of @entity7 is that she should be more honest in her next book , readers say			1
' @entity31 ’s account is the low - salt , low - fat , low - calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert , ' @entity50 's @entity49 said in a review today titled ' @entity58			1
' likewise , @entity10 said a @entity59 who has already devoured the book told him in an email , ' honestly , it is so vanilla and picked over			0
' she does a lot of complimenting people in @entity65 is clear - eyed and indefatigable			0
' ' " @entity7 " is no tell - all by a former official looking to settle scores , ' says the @entity69 's @entity68			2
@entity68 quotes @entity31 as writing in the book that she did n't always agree with president @entity74 and other administration officials , ' some of those times you ’ll read about in this book , but others will remain private to honor the cone of confidentiality that should exist between a president and his secretary of state , especially while he is still in office			1
' the anecdotes in the book mostly fall into the latter category , if early reviews are to be believed			0
@entity89 s account is the low - salt , low - fat , low - calorie offering with vanilla pudding as the dessert , ' one critic said @entity31 has routinely said that she 's not yet certain of her future political plans			1
it 's clear from the book that she is ' keeping all her political options open , ' however , @entity101 reporter @entity100 , writes			0
the 2008 presidential candidate obviously wants to be ' known not only for mastering the art of diplomacy , but also for having the policy chops to become chooser - in - chief , ' he said			0
but @entity31 does n't quite get the job done , according to @entity49			2
' the entire message of the book is that foreign policy is hard and complicated , so when @entity74 goes another route , ' than the one she advised him to take , ' @entity31 explains that it was a reasonable path to take having weighed all the complexities ' instead of explaining why her way would have been better , @entity49 says			2
' no one likes to lose a debate , including me			0
but this was the president ’s call and i respected his deliberations and decision , ' @entity31 says after explaining that she wanted to assist @entity125 rebel forces in forcibly removing @entity125 president @entity126 from power but @entity74 said no. on a similar note , @entity68 said , ' the book is a careful document designed to preserve , perhaps burnish , future possibilities			2
' @entity68 wrote that the ' normally cautious @entity31 ' comes off in the book as ' less a visionary and more a practical - minded problem solver			2
' the purpose of @entity31 's memoir was n't to provide a vision , though , @entity135 's @entity134 says			1
like most memoirs by politicians and presidential hopefuls , @entity31 likely penned the book for the following reasons : ' a payday , the aforementioned shadow campaign , the future right to say , “ i addressed that in my book ” — but reading pleasure is not among them			0
' ' as a general rule , the most engaging political memoirs are written by those who are ending their political careers , ' @entity134 said in an article panning @entity31 's memoir last month			1
such books out to be called , ' contractually obligated and desperate not to @entity157 , ' @entity59 strategist @entity155 told @entity134			0
' when someone is brave enough to write one of these books and call it " @entity162 and @entity163 " or something , then i might actually read it , ' @entity155 said , referring to the states that traditionally hold their presidential primaries first , and therefore set the tone on the race			0
in an interview with @entity173 's @entity172 about the book , @entity31 said she 'll make her decision about running for president again after she finishes her book tour and the 2014 midterm elections are over this fall .			1
