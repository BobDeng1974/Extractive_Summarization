@entity0 has been getting a lot of praise for admitting that he ‘ blubbed ’ while watching @entity3 , a @entity4 film released last year			1
it ’s a rose - tinted , nostalgic look back at a critical moment in 20th - century @entity4 history			1
every drop of sentiment is wrung out of the story , with brave young men and women risking their lives to take on an evil dictator			0
needless to say , the evil dictator who they ’re fighting is @entity41			0
@entity0 received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep what a surprise that such a storyline led the @entity48 leader to exclaim : ‘ @entity49 [ his wife ] and i watched it recently and blubbed			1
’ i ’m sure @entity3 is n’t the only @entity4 film that the right - on @entity55 will have cried their way through			1
for there have been so many over recent years that mythologised the ‘ brave and downtrodden ’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the @entity61			0
in truth , these movies — pride , @entity65 ( also a piece of miners ’ strike propaganda that depicted @entity41 as the @entity70 incarnate ) , made in @entity71 ( about a car factory strike ) and @entity73 ( about a group of redundant @entity76 steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money ) — might as well have been party political broadcasts for @entity48			1
for the keystone of these left - wing propaganda films is a pernicious rewriting of history , portraying @entity4 ’s recent past as a battle between heroic trade unionists , fighting to defend the poor and the vulnerable , and unfeeling bosses , bulldozing everything in their path in the ruthless pursuit of making money for their capitalist overlords			1
there is no acknowledgment by the film - makers that the unions ’ greed and bully - boy tactics all but destroyed the @entity4 economy , or that their beloved welfare state ( which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country ) relies on a strong , unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat			1
the film pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the @entity110 : bolshie unions and minorities ( in this case , homosexuals )			1
naturally , it does n’t take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life - and - death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their @entity122 colliery members			1
strangely absent from the story , of course , is any reference to the role the @entity38 played in bringing down successive @entity4 governments — both @entity142 and @entity48 alike — and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped @entity4 in the @entity145 and culminated in the @entity146			1
nor is there any mention of the attempt by @entity150 , the loony - left leader of the @entity38 , to persuade communist @entity152 — not to mention @entity153 — to bankroll the strike , which his members had n’t even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot			2
@entity158 is another film about ‘ brave and downtrodden ’ workers whose lives are made miserable by the @entity61 the same historical revisionism is exhibited in @entity163 , about women workers walking out on strike at the @entity167 car factory in @entity32 in 1968 , demanding equal pay with male employees			1
as with @entity3 , the dramatic heart of the story is a conflict between two groups of left - wing activists who gradually learn to make common cause — in this case , male and female shop - floor workers			0
at no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive			0
the viewer is expected to assume that the demands of the strikers are completely justified			0
made in @entity71 ’s political message could n’t be clearer , and it ends on a triumphant note with the passing of the @entity190 by a @entity48 government in 1970			2
a more honest assessment of the @entity4 car industry would have featured the way union firebrands such as @entity196 — ‘ @entity196 ’ — at @entity197 helped to destroy it and did so much damage to the economy at large			2
indeed , a more realistic ending to @entity163 would have pointed out that the @entity167 factory which once employed 40,000 people now has fewer than 4,000 , thanks , in part , to rising labour costs — pushed up by militant unions			0
brassed off starring @entity207 and @entity208 portrayed @entity41 as an orge then again , that would have meant acknowledging the inconvenient truth that the trade unions played a big role in the postwar decline of @entity4 ’s industrial base			2
perhaps the most glaring omission from such left - wing propaganda movies is any concession that the policies of @entity41 were a necessary corrective to the chaos and pessimism of the @entity145			0
the fact is that her government inherited a country on the brink of political and economic collapse and restored it to rude good health , able to hold its head up high again in the world			0
but in so many @entity110 - inspired @entity4 films of the past 25 years , whether @entity232 ( about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a @entity142 government ) , @entity73 or @entity65 , @entity41 is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working - class communities and replace nice left - wing values with nasty right - wing ones			1
inevitably , the period before @entity41 is depicted as a golden age , a pastoral idyll straight out of a @entity245 commercial , while the @entity4 she left behind is portrayed as a money - grubbing spiritual wasteland			2
is it any wonder that such films make @entity0 , brought up by a @entity253 academic father , ‘ blub ’ ? the only exception to this disgraceful series of truth - twisting films was @entity258 , in which @entity4 ’s first female prime minister was shown in a more nuanced light , almost in spite of its makers ’ left - wing instincts			1
made in @entity71 is about women workers walking out on strike at the @entity167 car factory in @entity32 in 1968 , demanding equal pay with male employees			0
it is broadly unsympathetic — there are plenty of scenes in which she is seen to be suffering from dementia , which suggests an element of hostility — but actress @entity278 brings such depth and humanity to the lead role that @entity41 emerges as a more complex figure than the bogeyman of left - wing mythology			0
not surprisingly , @entity258 was condemned by many in the @entity4 film establishment for being ‘ shallow ’ and ‘ superficial ’ , an example of ‘ self - important ’ film - making			1
no doubt if it had depicted @entity41 as a cruel monster , the same critics would have acclaimed it an out - and - out masterpiece			0
this mistake was corrected the following year by @entity48 - supporting @entity296			2
in his lavish £ 27 million opening ceremony for the @entity299 he made no direct reference to @entity4 ’s greatest postwar prime minister — which was odd in itself — but left viewers in no doubt about his view of @entity305			2
once again we were treated to the familiar left - wing version of @entity4 ’s history , in which top - hatted @entity142 industrialists , determined to despoil the country with dark satanic mills , are stopped in their tracks by an alliance of suffragettes , trade unionists and lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender activists			2
@entity296 ’s collaborator , @entity319 , condemned @entity41 for being ‘ insufficiently @entity4 ’ and said ‘ although she draped herself in the @entity321 , she never seemed to understand this country ’			0
@entity258 was condemned by many in the @entity4 film establishment for being ‘ shallow ’ and ‘ superficial ’ , an example of ‘ self - important ’ film - making the truth is , it ’s the @entity110 that does n’t understand contemporary @entity4			1
we are not a drab , depressed country , riven with class divisions and grotesque inequality , as you would think from watching films such as @entity3 and @entity65			0
on the contrary , crime is lower , life expectancy higher and the standard of living better than at any time in our past			0
the rights of women , gays and ethnic minorities are all robustly defended by politicians of both @entity110 and @entity343 , and our schools and hospitals have never been better ( or more lavishly funded )			0
@entity4 now has the fastest - growing economy in the western world , with more jobs being created last year in @entity349 — ironically , the county where so many of these left - wing propaganda films have been set — than in the whole of @entity354			0
could n’t we have just one home - grown film that celebrates the miracle that is modern @entity4 and brings a tear of pride to us all , rather than left - wing drivel that triggers ‘ blubbing ’ from @entity0 ?			1

@entity0 has admitted that he cried watching the @entity4 film pride
movie centres on the 1984 miners ' strike and a group of gays and lesbians
@entity158 and @entity232 could also get the @entity48 leader blubbing
