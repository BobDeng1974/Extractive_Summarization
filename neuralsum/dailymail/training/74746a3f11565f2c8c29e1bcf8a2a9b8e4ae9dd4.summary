by @entity0 @entity1 has admitted it would be a ' miracle ' if @entity4 won the @entity5 this season			1
the @entity7 compared the current situation at @entity9 to when he took over an imbalanced squad at @entity11 in 2009			1
but while @entity12 did go on an win the @entity14 during his first campaign with the @entity17 giants , he concedes it is unlikely he 'll be able to repeat the trick at @entity4			1
asked whether he should be judged on his second season in @entity40 as opposed to his first , @entity12 replied : ' that is always the case			1
' what i have experienced is that i was champion in @entity45 and in @entity17 , so it is possible but it is very difficult			0
' when i got to @entity11 the [ squad ] selection was not stable			2
what we did was a miracle			2
' now here the selection is not in balance			0
there are five no 9s and six no 10s and so on			0
and we do n't have defenders			0
' spectacular : captain @entity59 scored an overhead kick against @entity27 but in a losing cause positive start : @entity63 has impressed since his move from @entity65 but is out injured for @entity36 incoming : @entity4 signed @entity67 defender @entity66 this week for £ 16m transfer target : @entity4 are close to a deal for the @entity71 winger @entity70 when asked directly if it would take a ' miracle ' to win the @entity5 this season , he said : ' yes i think so			1
it is always possible but it shall be very difficult			0
' @entity12 will be with the injured @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity63 , @entity81 and @entity82 for the trip to the @entity84 , while @entity85 and @entity86 are doubtful			2
new £ 16m signing @entity66 has yet to receive his work permit following his move from @entity67 and so is unavailable			0
@entity4 are inching closer to the £ 60m signing of @entity70 from @entity71 , with further progress expected on sunday .			1
