by @entity0 @entity1 are to operate in 2015 with the biggest budget in the team 's history			1
@entity6 ceo @entity5 confirmed at the start of this season his organisation were digging deeper into their pockets than ever before in order to compete this year , with the figure rumoured to be around £ 200million			2
the @entity13 - based marque , however , are still considerably off the pace of not just the dominant team this season in @entity17 , but also the likes of @entity19 and @entity20 money talks : @entity5 ( right , with chancellor @entity22 ) watches qualifying for the @entity25 @entity24 confident : @entity26 insists @entity1 are in a good position as they plan for the future with @entity30 due to come on board as power - unit supplier from next year , it is apparent no expense is being spared in order to return to the front			1
' we are not in a position where we are struggling to get money , we are perfectly fine , and with @entity30 coming on board , even more so , ' said racing director @entity26			1
' for this year we 've had our biggest ever budget and next year that is going to increase , so there are no worries			2
' such remarks , however , would appear to fly in the face of the @entity45 's determination to cut costs , although only minor savings have been announced for next year by the @entity48			0
' cost cutting and budgets are different , ' insisted @entity26			0
' if we want a £ 500million budget but spend only £ 100million then that is our problem , so they are different topics			0
' @entity26 also insists @entity1 's financial well - being means they will continue to be patient with regard to a title sponsor			1
@entity58 : @entity59 celebrates after taking third position in the qualifying for the @entity62 tribute : @entity64 wore a special pink helmet in memory of his father at the @entity25 @entity24 following @entity69 's withdrawal at the end of last season @entity1 were due to announce a successor in december , but nothing materialised			1
earlier this year @entity5 then remarked a new sponsor would be signed up after the first two or three races , but again all remained quiet			2
asked about the current situation , @entity26 replied : ' we will announce it when we sign one			0
obviously we have n't announced anything because we have n't finalised anything			0
' there is no one - off reason			0
there are a few delays because there is nothing to sign or ready to be signed			0
performance does n't help , and the world economic situation is not the best , but @entity1 has 32 partners and sponsors , so we are fine			1

@entity1 still off the pace as they *lag* behind @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20
@entity96 confident of success with @entity30 *supplying* *engines* next season
@entity25 team confident of *securing* new sponsor
