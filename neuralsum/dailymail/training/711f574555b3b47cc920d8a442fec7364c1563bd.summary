for many people keeping their car fit and healthy is something that generally gets forgotten until it ’s time for a service			0
but an app could keep your vehicle ship shape by using a sensor to detect any problems with the car			2
called @entity11 , it will also let you know how much the repairs will cost you and what will happen if they are not addressed , such as the car 's fuel efficiency decreasing			2
@entity17 - based @entity16 is currently seeking funding on @entity19			1
their app and sensor combo can be used to determine when a car is ' sick '			1
the sensor attaches to an @entity24 available on most modern cars ( shown )			1
this then connects to an app via @entity28 that keeps the user updated on how their car is doing the @entity17 - based company ’s system consists of a vehicle sensor and an app. for many people living in towns and cities , growing flowers , fruits or vegetables is out of the question			1
but a team of inventors from @entity45 has unveiled a device that makes it possible , via an indoor greenhouse called @entity49 that can be controlled by a smartphone			0
by connecting their phone to the greenhouse , people will be able to grow fruit and vegetables in their homes without needing access to a garden			0
the indoor gadget uses a built - in miniature computer that detects when plants need water and the ideal temperature for their growth			0
the glass - sided device uses special sensors to pick up these readings , which then automatically activate different parts of the machine			0
and the device warms up , cools down , turns on a light or waters the plants autonomously without input from the user			0
the sensor , which will cost £ 30 ( $ 50 ) , plugs into the @entity77 ( @entity76 ) port , which almost all modern cars have			1
hardware within the sensor monitors the car and checks for any problems , and it then connects to the app on a smartphone via @entity28			1
the company is currently seeking funding on @entity19			2
through the app users will see when they need an oil change , when the air filter needs replacing and so on			1
when attached the sensor is powered by the car , meaning it does n’t need a battery			2
multiple sensors can also be placed on different cars , with the app using a multi-vehicle feature to check up on all of them			2
if repairs are needed the app will show how much the cost to fix the car will be , perhaps using crowdsourcing in future to find cheaper deals			2
and it will also estimate how issues could affect the car			0
' we want to give you confidence when dealing with repair shops , ' the company writes on @entity19			0
' we want to give you peace of mind over all the cars that you own			0
we want you to turn to @entity116 when you are having car troubles			0
' the app will be available from october this year for @entity119 , with an @entity121 version due to be released in april 2015			1
and over the next year various features of the app , such as repair estimates and multi-vehicle control , will be rolled out			0
the app includes features such as telling you the status of your airbags ( left ) and whether the car needs an oil change			1
a multi-vehicle feature ( right ) also lets a user keep track of multiple cars at once the £ 30 ( $ 50 ) sensor will be available later this year , while the app will be available for @entity119 in october and for @entity121 in may 2015 , with various features to be rolled out over the next year			1
