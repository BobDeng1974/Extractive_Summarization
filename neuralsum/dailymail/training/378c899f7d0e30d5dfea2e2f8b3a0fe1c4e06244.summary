the sister of missing @entity2 lyricist @entity1 has revealed her family 's battle to come to terms with his disappearance			1
this sunday marks 20 years since the guitarist checked out of a @entity9 hotel never to be seen again			1
two weeks later his car was found abandoned at a motorway service station			1
despite numerous and high - profile appeals in the media , no trace of @entity1 has been found - either dead or alive			1
although he was declared legally dead in 2008 , @entity1 ' sister @entity15 hopes he will be remembered for his talents rather than his troubles - which culminated in him being admitted to a mental health unit			1
@entity1 is pictured right performing with the @entity2 but while mrs @entity15 is aiming to secure a more positive legacy for her brother , coming to terms with the events of february 1 1995 is still a long way off for her family - especially in light of the death of her father @entity32 two years ago			1
she said : ' it was difficult losing dad ...			2
' he knew towards the end that his life was limited			2
it was n't a sudden death			2
it was difficult because he had to face up to that realisation - that we all may have to - we may not find out what happened to @entity46			1
it was obviously difficult for my father			1
' going through his bereavement , i recognised the difference between that and someone who is missing			2
' it is very different			2
when someone dies you have that acute loss			2
it sounds like a cliche , that bereavement is a process - but it really is			2
' you can go to a crematorium , graveyard or place where you have scattered their ashes and remember ...			2
. but when someone goes missing you are left with this ongoing uncertainty			2
' not knowing makes it worse			1
' much has been made about @entity1 ' sudden disappearance - which came against a backdrop of personal turmoil			1
in 1994 , @entity2 released their third album and dark masterpiece @entity74			1
this sunday marks 20 years since the guitarist checked out of a @entity9 hotel never to be seen again with 70 per cent of the words written by @entity1 , a man who once famously carved the words 4 real into his arm in response to a journalist who questioned his band 's integrity , many sought to draw parallels between his state of mind and songs on subjects such as prostitution , anorexia and the horrors of the @entity94			1
in the run up to the lp 's release , @entity1 was admitted to @entity98 in @entity99 before being checked into the @entity100 as his alcoholism and self - harming spiralled out - of - control			1
less than two months on from smashing his guitar to smithereens at a sold out @entity9 show in @entity106 , a now shaven haired @entity1 appeared to be on the mend			1
as well as writing lyrics for new @entity2 songs , the ever - professional and punctual university graduate prepared to for an upcoming promotional tour of the @entity112			1
he and his band 's singer @entity113 checked into @entity9 's @entity115 ahead of a flight across the @entity117 the next day			1
but the following morning when @entity113 went to rouse his bandmate , no answer came from room 516			2
when hotel staff opened up the room , they found the room empty - save for a handful of personal items			1
a car belonging to @entity1 ( pictured ) was found abandoned at a motorway service station two weeks after he was last seen his sister said that immediately sent alarm bells ringing			1
' despite what people may think , his disappearance really was out of character for him			1
he was always constantly there , if not physically , in conversation with you , ' she added			2
' even when he was touring , we always knew where he was			2
' the idea he was acting out and walked off as to say " i 'm not getting on this flight " was not him			2
' he was always passionate and professional about the band			2
he had never done anything like this before			0
' the days that followed were pure agony for the @entity149 as well as his bandmates - who were all childhood friends			0
eventually his silver @entity152 was found at the now defunct @entity153 - next to the old @entity154			1
the car , which had been lived in for some time and had a flat battery , was later put on a tow rope and transported back to @entity1 ' parents house in @entity160			1
but the fact a steering lock was on gave the @entity1 ' parents a sign of hope			1
mrs @entity15 added : ' why would you worry about someone stealing your car if you were chaotically thinking of ending your life ? ' however , the days and months passed with no real progress on his whereabouts			1
already emotionally exhausted by what had happened , his family said they were left further drained by the ordeal to come			1
mrs @entity15 said : ' he was reported missing in @entity176 because the hotel was nearby , yet his car was found near the @entity154 which involved @entity179 and at some point he had returned to his flat in @entity99 which involved @entity182			1
' at one point my mother and father had a visit to the house from the police at about 3am			1
' they had been sent here to search the premises on instruction of the @entity194			0
' i do n't know why they did it			0
possibly because they thought it was a publicity stunt or they possibly thought it was foul play			0
' then there were the false gossip and rumours to deal with			0
mrs @entity15 said : ' people said all sorts of things in the initial stages - that he was hiding out at a fan 's house or that we knew where he was			0
it was just totally fabricated			0
in 1994 , @entity2 released their third album and dark masterpiece @entity74 ' that hampered the police 's involvement , they had to explore statements like that rather than just be focused on the investigation			1
' also he was noted as a vulnerable adult on his missing person 's file - because he had a recent hospital admission and prescribed anti-depressants			0
' we assumed the police would risk assess the situation			0
but in retrospect , there was n't that much active searching done			0
they would follow up leads if people contacted them , but they did n't actively try to find him			0
one officer even said he had a right to go missing			0
' it was incredibly hurtful			0
' however , @entity1 ' sister refused to give in - tirelessly campaigning and working so other families going through same hell as her would be met with fewer barriers			1
' things have definitely improved			0
people have family liaison officers now and improvements have also been made in the way the police communicate with families of missing people , ' mrs @entity15 added			1
as well as promoting the charity @entity255 , which helped her family so much , she has also campaigned for changes in the law to those seeking to have their relative declared presumed dead when a body has not been found			1
she added : ' even though we had @entity46 declared legally dead that has n't assisted us in anyway dealing with the loss of him			1
' that process was just a financial matter			0
' i think unless somebody returned or you recover their body or you at least know where they are - even if they do n't want to return - that would resolve the matter			0
@entity1 bottom left with his band mates ( left ) in 1992 and second left in front of @entity282 in 1991 ' the only thing that has helped me is meeting other family members			1
even though every missing person disappears for a different reason , the experiences are the same for those left behind			0
' what you end up being left with is your imagination and you can construct everything in that ...			0
some people get a fair set of beliefs as to what happened			2
' but i try not to go down that route because that 's just speculation ...			0
. it is very difficult not to do that though			0
' one of things that can go through your mind is ' was it something i said ? was it something i did n't say but should have done ? ' ' every person i 've met who has had someone go missing has felt that			0
you question whether you are part of the reason why they do n't want to be here any more			0
that makes feel sad because it could possibly be the case ...			0
. you ca n't help but not think that			0
' mental health support worker mrs @entity15 added that one thing which has helped her has been her renewed faith in @entity322			0
she added : ' over the last few years i have been going back to church - the church i used to go to years ago			1
and i 've really found that having a faith has really made sense of the situation to me			2
' i feel now that even if i do n't know where @entity46 is or ever find out where he is , eventually at some point i will know			0
i feel that strongly now about it			0
i ca n't talk for other people			0
' in the meantime , @entity1 ' sister wants people to remember him as a brilliant writer than a mere tragic figure of ' cult of @entity1 ' caricature			1
@entity1 is pictured in a ' missing people ' poster held by his sister @entity15 @entity113 , @entity344 and @entity345 of @entity2 , pictured in 2012 ' it 's sort of snowballed into this identity that he 's only known for			1
' the fact that he was really intelligent and sensitive and that he was the force behind the band their lyrics just seems to get forgotten			0
' we 've always been tremendously proud of @entity46			0
' he always excelled at whatever he did at whether that was at school , college and university or with the band			0
' i suppose his legacy lives on in a way through the songs he wrote for the band - but his work is often set against the backdrop of his disappearance and his problems			2
' i have n't decided what shape that will take , but there are number of plans i 'm working through at the moment			0
' mrs @entity15 also plans to keep up her charity work too			0
she is a member of @entity376 who have released a fundraising single called @entity378			0
the track can be downloaded for a donation of £ 1 .			0
