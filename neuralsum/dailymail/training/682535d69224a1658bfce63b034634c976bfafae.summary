a foreign nurse who force - fed her baby to death can not be deported because it would breach her right to a family life			1
the @entity7 woman won her fight to stay in @entity9 under controversial human rights laws			1
and even though the 33 - year - old was named in the widely - reported court case that saw her jailed for causing the baby ’s death , she has now been granted anonymity			1
the woman , who can only be referred to as @entity7 has been granted lifetime anonymity as well as leave to remain in the @entity9 unconditionally ( picture posed by model ) having served her three - year sentence , she has been free since april last year to look after her three surviving children			1
last night one @entity21 said the situation was ‘ perverse ’ and called the immigration tribunal ’s ruling ‘ warped ’			0
home secretary @entity25 has made repeated attempts to remove the woman , who can be referred to only as @entity7			2
the case will again raise questions about the use of the @entity32 to protect criminals			0
the @entity34 said the ruling was ‘ disappointing ’			2
the nurse , who came to the @entity9 on a student visa in 2000 , used a small milk jug to tip baby rice african corn porridge and chicken soup into her child ’s mouth			1
@entity7 ’s legal victory – using @entity44 8 of the @entity32 – means that she has been allowed to remain in the @entity9 unconditionally with her family and been granted lifetime anonymity			1
home secretary @entity25 made several attempts to deport the woman , who can only be referred to as @entity7 , before today 's ruling which was described as ' perverse ' by a conservative back bencher @entity52 , a @entity21 mp who has called for the reining - in of human rights laws , said : ‘ many people will look at this case , a mother jailed for force - feeding her baby and feel it reflects the warped nature of our human rights laws today			1
‘ the argument is that she is being separated from her kids but not only was she separated from them in prison but there were also care proceedings brought against her			0
' the children have also spent periods of time in @entity7 so the arguments for not deporting her fall away			1
it shows how the judges have expanded and shifted the goalposts from human rights in a way that is pretty arbitrary and perverse			0
‘ it does not reflect anything written into the @entity32 and certainly not anything @entity80 has agreed to			0
‘ article 8 is being used by convicted , jailed criminals to stay in this country			0
this is n’t the only case			0
i actually think the article can be a threat to family life , in particular vulnerable children and partners			1
’ he said that almost 90 per cent of successful deportation appeals are using @entity44 – up to 400 cases a year : ‘ article 8 is the single biggest problem for deporting a serious foreign criminal and this is something that has only really developed in the last seven years			0
what will it be like in another seven ? it could be almost impossible to deport someone			0
’ fellow @entity21 mp @entity101 said that the use of human rights law to protect the nurse was ‘ crazy ’			0
he added : ‘ the echr was never intended to protect people who carry out terrible crimes from being sent back to their own country			0
’ the three - year sentence handed to @entity7 at the trial in 2011 meant that under @entity34 rules she could be considered for automatic deportation			1
but attempts to deport her following her release from prison were rejected after she appealed and won her case at a lower immigration tribunal in february			0
when mrs may launched an appeal to overturn the decision at the @entity123 and @entity124 last month , the earlier decision was upheld			0
a social services report deemed her children were under ‘ no significant risk of harm ’ and described the family as a ‘ close , committed unit with strong cultural and religious beliefs ’			2
her partner was granted custody of the three children following care proceedings in 2010 and the family has lived in a three - bed @entity138 home since @entity7 ’s release			1
during her trial it emerged that @entity7 , who had already applied for indefinite leave to remain in the @entity9 when her child died , had paid ‘ little attention ’ to social services who had been involved with the family			1
the @entity34 said it was seeking to appeal against the tribunal ’s decision			2
it added : ‘ through the recently passed @entity151 , we are making it easier to remove people from the @entity9 and harder for individuals to prolong their stay with spurious appeals , by cutting the number of appeal rights from 17 to four			2
‘ it will also ensure that judges deal with @entity44 8 claims in the right way — making clear the right to a family life is not regarded as absolute and unqualified			2

@entity7 nurse secures right to live in @entity9 despite *killing* her baby
her legal team successfully argued the woman is entitled to a family life
the woman was jailed for three years but was freed in april to look after her three surviving children
she has also been granted anonymity despite being named at the time of her conviction
the @entity34 described @entity7 's legal victory ' disappointing '
