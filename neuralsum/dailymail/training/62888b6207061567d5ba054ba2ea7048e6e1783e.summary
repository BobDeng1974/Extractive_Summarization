by @entity0 follow @ @ oliver_todd @entity1 has admitted he was not ready for the @entity3 job when he took over as caretaker - manager at @entity5 last season			1
@entity1 took over at @entity3 after @entity7 was sacked with four matches of the season left , winning two , drawing one and losing one			1
there was talk of @entity3 's record appearance - maker getting the job full time but the club instead plumped for @entity18 boss @entity17 as @entity7 ' replacement			1
' when i took the job there were a lot of things that i was quite happy with , but there and was the odd thing where i thought " i 'm not quite ready for this "			0
well it was n't that i was n't ready for it , but i could do with a little bit more experience , ' @entity1 told thefa.com			2
' i have gained that experience from sir @entity52 ( @entity52 ) but last year i was still playing so i was n't really focused on the coaching and the other side of things			1
learning from the best : @entity1 spent years working under sir @entity52 as a player at @entity5 ' this year i can put everything into it and learn from someone who has managed at the top in so many other countries			1
it has been a good thing that i have been with sir @entity52 for so long but also i am now getting to see how other people work as well			1
i got a taste of @entity7 and now @entity17 this year			1
' @entity1 has now hung up his boots after an illustrious career , but was still playing at the time of his elevation last season - an adjustment he struggled to deal with			2
mentor : @entity1 will be working with @entity3 's new midfield signing @entity72 , who arrives from @entity73 ' yeah , i mean there was just so much to do , ' he said			2
' before training you are in at half seven and by the time half ten had come you were knackered			0
' because i was still a player i just wanted to make the players aware that i was the club manager and get that distance away from them initially to say : " i am not joining in training , i am looking to see what you are doing "			0
you ca n't really do that if you are getting involved			0
' initially that was my feeling - not get involved with training and see how they were all performing			0
the majority of the lads were all fit so i had plenty to choose from so i wanted to get a good look			0
if you are involved and in the middle of it you do n't quite get the same look			0
' @entity93 in your ear : @entity95 has a word with @entity1 during last year 's game at @entity5			0

@entity3 *legend* is completing his coaching badges ahead of new season
he admits he found his late - season player - coach role *difficult*
@entity1 says he learned from sir @entity52 and @entity7
now the @entity32 will work with new manager @entity17
@entity1 would consider taking the @entity3 top job in future
