they had already decided to rob someone because their plan to sell dvds to raise money had not made them as much as they wanted			2
the woman held on tightly to the handbag when she heard the footsteps behind her quicken and feared she was going to be robbed			2
after feeling a tug , she turned and saw @entity8 in his hoody			1
she screamed to alert neighbours , causing him to scarper			0
@entity8 , 22 , and @entity9 , 19 , ran off to a nearby pub , but were arrested half an hour later in a park after witnesses gave police descriptions of them			1
in her impact statement , the victim said : ' i still feel the same anxiety when walking alone anywhere , which is unavoidable when walking to work			0

' the pair struck when the terrified woman was just yards from her home in @entity12 ( pictured ) , @entity13 @entity65 , defending @entity8 , said : ' this sort of offence causes misery to people			1
' ' in so far as they can make amends , these young men have done all they can			0
having done the harm he did , he can do no more to put it right , after his frank admissions to the police and his early guilty plea			0
' @entity79 , for @entity9 , added : ' the victim will have known from an early stage that she would not need to come to court to relive this incident			1
' both defence lawyers said the attackers had shown genuine remorse , and @entity9 - who has never before been in trouble - wanted to write to the woman to apologise			1

he had nowhere to live , he was sleeping rough on occasions			0

the judge , recorder @entity108 , told them : ' she would be outraged if , after what she had been through , i simply allowed you your liberty			2
' you hatched a plan , because of your financial situation , to target someone exactly like her to snatch their bag and take money from it			0
' so it was when she came into your view that you targeted her and followed her for about 500 yards as she was on her way home			0
' at some stage , she became aware of that , and frightened , she got out her house keys , but not before you @entity8 , after a game of paper , scissors , had elected to be the one who snatched the bag			1
' if i was simply concerned with the situation of each of you , given your previous good characters and given you are still young men and you have seen the error of your ways , i would try to do something that involved not sending you to immediate custody , but i can not do that because i have the concerns regarding the complainant to address first and foremost			0
