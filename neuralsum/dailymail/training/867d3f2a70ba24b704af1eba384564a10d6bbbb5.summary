@entity0 , 29 , created website are they @entity3 , which runs comprehensive searches on people , after she found out her husband had a history of violence against previous partners a woman who was unaware her new husband had a history of violence against previous partners has set up a website offering £ 200 background checks to try to stop others suffering a similar fate			1
the website , called ‘ are they safe ’ , is thought to be the first of its kind , with its founders offering to undertake comprehensive searches of public records to verify someone ’s identity , marital history , finances , and uncover any criminal convictions			1
anyone worried about a prospective or current partner , a potential son or daughter - in - law or a business partner , can pay a fee and be supplied with a report of the kind usually compiled by private detectives at much greater cost			1
but there have been warnings that the new site goes much further than the ‘ @entity45 ’ checks for domestic violence currently available to police , and could be used by people embarking on anonymous ‘ fishing expeditions ’ to uncover information that could be used maliciously			1
@entity49 has been created by @entity50 businesswoman @entity0 , 29 , together with experienced investigators and private security specialists			1
ms @entity0 had been the victim of violent domestic abuse at the hands of her husband , @entity55 , before she left him last year			1
when she married @entity55 , ms @entity57 was unaware he had abused previous partners and had two assault convictions			1
and in september , he pleaded guilty to bigamy , saying he had another wife in @entity62			0
‘ if something like this service had been available to me , i would have avoided years of violence and misery , ’ ms @entity57 said			2
but professor @entity67 of @entity68 , an expert in the field of domestic violence , said the numbers of women who would be helped might be limited			2
she said : ‘ if you ’ve fallen for someone , you may not want to check them out at an early stage			0
i ’m not convinced enough people will use it for it to be truly preventative			2
’ she said there could also be privacy issues , while if a former perpetrator had successfully undergone a ‘ perpetrator programme ’ to modify his or her behaviour , disclosing their past would be unfair to them			0
she added : ‘ i also have concerns that victims will come to be seen as responsible for stopping violence – that makes me uncomfortable			1
’ the information supplied by @entity94 they safe is derived from legal , subscription - only databases of the sort used by private investigators and insurance companies			2
for £ 195 , the site offers to verify an individual ’s personal information , marital details , criminal history and will also reveal any credit warnings or county court judgments against them			1
the are they safe site searches public records to verify someone ’s identity , marital history , finances , and uncover any criminal convictions when ms @entity57 ( right ) married @entity55 ( left ) , she was unaware he had abused previous partners and had two assault convictions an ‘ enhanced background check ’ costing £ 350 involves further financial checks , disclosure of current and previous company directorships , and property ownership			1
it will even reveal if the subject of the search appears on international lists of wanted criminals and terrorists			0
some of this information is already available to prospective partners via the police , under the @entity132 , known as ‘ @entity45 ’ because it was introduced after @entity134 woman @entity133 was murdered by her partner , @entity135 , in 2009			2
however , @entity136 and @entity138 assistant chief constable @entity137 , the national police lead on domestic violence , admitted yesterday that @entity133 ’s law searches usually take weeks			2
are they @entity3 promises results within a single week , a period which it says will soon be cut to 24 hours			0
there are concerns that the site could be used for anonymous ‘ fishing expeditions ’ to uncover information that could be used maliciously ms @entity137 said : ‘ are they @entity3 appears to offer a similar service [ to @entity132 ] at a significant cost when disclosure through @entity132 is free			1
’ but she added that she did not wish to criticise the new service , adding : ‘ victim safety is our absolute priority			0
’ ms @entity0 said many people felt wary about using @entity45 , as it requires someone to go to a police station in person and make a statement to an officer			1
are they safe is not only available to people in or thinking about entering a relationship , but could be used by suspicious relatives , neighbours or friends			1
the website asks : ‘ how well do you know your partner or potential partner ’s past ? are you worried about your son or daughter ’s new partner ? is something not adding up ? are they who they say they are ? have they ever been convicted of a criminal offence ? do they have a record of domestic violence ? we will uncover this for you			1
’ ms @entity0 accepted that some clients would not be able to afford the fees , but said she hoped to introduce a ‘ heavily subsidised ’ service for people on low incomes and benefits			1
she said : ‘ i do n’t want anyone to be excluded			0
i ’m not doing this to make money , but because i want to prevent people becoming victims			2
’ however , @entity201 , the @entity202 mp who led the campaign for @entity45 , said she feared it might allow people to go on ‘ fishing expeditions ’ which undermined a person ’s right to privacy			2
she added : ‘ i would also be concerned if people were accessing their partners ’ details without the necessary support being in place			1
’ this was because if a check persuaded someone they ought to leave their partner , ‘ the point when a relationship ends is also the point of maximum risk ’			0
according to a @entity227 study published in 2006 , almost 70 per cent of domestic violence perpetrators held by police have been arrested before			2
in cases where clients are shown to be at serious risk , are they safe will also provide advice on security , and on working with police			0
‘ we will provide exactly the kind of support @entity201 is talking about , ’ ms @entity0 said			1
@entity238 student @entity237 , 28 , last week became one of the first to use are they safe			0
of her partner , she said : ‘ he did n’t like me using social network websites , and he did n’t like my job			0
he ’d insist on holding my phone			0
i decided to check him out			0
’ she learned he had been charged with rape and convicted of assault			0
‘ it explained a lot , ’ @entity237 said			0
she left him , and within days he started to text her death threats			0
on are they @entity3 ’s advice , she went to police			0
he was not arrested , but the threats have stopped , for now .			0
