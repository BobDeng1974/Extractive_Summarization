by @entity0 published : 16:30 est , 4 april 2014 updated : 16:30 est , 4 april 2014 @entity1 made @entity2 a horticultural household name			1
but , as a new tv series and book reveal , it owes much to a formidable woman - his mother , @entity8			1
the most provocative and influential garden of recent times , @entity1 has anticipated many of the gardening trends of the past 50 years - wildflower meadows , tropical - style gardens and successional planting , where flowers appear in a continuous wave from spring until autumn			1
@entity19 today with @entity2 , the enfant terrible of @entity21 horticulture , the garden was originally created by his parents , with the help of the great @entity25 architect @entity24			1
the @entity26 at @entity1 , @entity27 during the early @entity28 months @entity29 and @entity30 bought @entity1 in 1910 and @entity31 , as he was always known , was born there in 1921			1
when @entity29 died in 1933 , @entity8 took control of the garden and for the next four decades presided over it with an iron trowel			0
although @entity31 would later be credited with popularising the meadow style , it was @entity8 who first introduced it to @entity40 , transforming the rough grass in front of the house into a tapestry of wild flowers			0
@entity40 's famous @entity26 was also @entity8 's creation			1
@entity8 was known to her family as ' the management ' and she cultivated her six children with the same obsessive zeal as she cultivated her six - acre garden			2
@entity1 , @entity8 with a young @entity31 she taught them the latin names of plants and tested them ruthlessly on plant identification , sending the five boys weekly bundles of fresh flowers when they were at boarding school			2
@entity31 was the most biddable of her children , and also painfully shy			0
even as a grown man he was happy to spend almost all his time with his mother			0
after a spell as a lecturer in horticulture , @entity31 returned to @entity40 , and to @entity8 , in 1954			0
now with only three gardeners - originally there had been nine - he and @entity8 opened a plant nursery to supplement their income			2
@entity8 died in 1972 , aged 91 ; deprived of his main companion , @entity31 blossomed socially and @entity40 became famous for its jolly weekend parties , full of enthusiastic horticulturists			0
relieved of the constraints of fashion and taste after his mother 's death , @entity31 could experiment in the garden at will			1
his most famous and controversial alteration after @entity8 's death was to dig up the 80 - year - old @entity83 and transform it into an @entity84			1
here , lush foliage like hardy bananas and the huge elephant 's ear , @entity89 , were mixed with brightly coloured late - summer plants including dahlias , cannas , salvias and begonias			2
this caused outrage and , like a naughty child , he delighted in the furore , describing the sound of the rose roots being ripped from the earth as ' music to my ears '			0
the vibrant colours and textured leaves in the @entity84 at @entity1 , @entity27 , @entity107 during the @entity108 into autumn predictably , despite the controversy , @entity31 's @entity110 began a trend for exotic planting that continues to this day			1
shortly before his death in 2006 , @entity31 set up a charitable trust that has ensured @entity1 is still open to the public			2
the garden continues to evolve , but the spirit of @entity8 and @entity31 lives on there			0
it is still a place full of surprises			0
extracted from @entity21 gardens in time by @entity0 ( @entity125 , £ 20 ) , also available as 4 mini e-books , £ 4.99 each			0
the tv series starts tuesday , 9pm , @entity128			1

the @entity1 gardens have spear - *headed* many gardening trends
a new tv series and book reveal that this was down to @entity138 's mother
the garden that @entity2 is so famous for was originally created by his parents
