by @entity0 , deputy political editor @entity1 : 20:33 est , 29 december 2013 @entity2 : 20:33 est , 29 december 2013 in his @entity4 message ed @entity6 has signaled that @entity7 may put free tax - payer funded childcare at the heart of its election manifesto @entity7 is to put taxpayer - funded free childcare at the heart of the party ’s general election campaign , @entity6 signals today			1
the @entity7 leader says he will make childcare a key plank of @entity7 ’s attack on the cost of living in 2014 , building on his pledge to freeze energy bills and crack down on pay day lenders			2
in his @entity4 message , released as an online video today , mr @entity6 warns that @entity24 is in the grip of ‘ biggest cost - of - living crisis in a generation ’			1
labour sources have already revealed that the party is contemplating a ‘ big offer ’ on childcare as a centrepiece of the party ’s election manifesto , which would see taxpayers fund state childcare for all pre-school children			1
those on low incomes would get free childcare while the better off would initially receive subsidised low - cost childcare places			1
the party might decide to make universal provision a long - term goal			0
mr @entity6 says today : ‘ we are in the midst of the biggest cost - of - living crisis in a generation			1
‘ people do not want the earth			0
they would much prefer some very specific promises , specific things about what a government will do - whether it ’s freezing energy bills , taking action on pay day lenders , or tackling issues around childcare which lots of working parents face			2
‘ all of this is adding up to a programme for how we can change things			0
’ a @entity6 aide said yesterday : ‘ the cost of living crisis concerns jobs , wages and prices and childcare touches on all three of those things			1
‘ greater availability of childcare ensures that it pays people to work			2
a huge number of women say that they ca n’t afford to go back to work because of childcare costs			1
’ @entity7 has been emboldened by a report earlier this month by the @entity78 which calculated that attracting 280,000 people back into the labour market would save almost £ 1.5bn in extra tax revenue and lower spending on benefits and tax credits			2
@entity85 , the mp who is leading @entity7 ’s policy review , has said the party is considering paying fathers to go to antenatal classes and hospital appointments with their expectant partners			0
@entity6 says that offering the service will stimulate the economy by getting more parents back to work in a recent speech to the @entity97 think tank he said he was ‘ looking at paid leave for prospective fathers to attend antenatal sessions and hospital appointments during pregnancy ’			1
@entity7 has also promised to increase the 15 hours of free childcare a week for three - and four - year - olds introduced by the @entity106 to 25 hours			1
in a pitch for votes in marginal constituencies , mr @entity6 says : ‘ every morning i get up i ’m going to be thinking about you , about how i can make your life better , your life easier - no easy answers - not an easy life - but how do we tip the balance towards hope and away from the struggles that you are facing			2
’ in an attack on the @entity121 , who say that they have a ‘ long - term plan ’ to put the economy back on track , mr @entity6 today insists that his pledges to ease the cost of living are not just gimmicks but also represent a coherent plan which will boost national economic strength over the next few years			1
he says : ‘ people are thinking they have made the sacrifices - and the government keeps telling them that everything is fixed			0
but it does not seem fixed to them			0
’ ‘ the @entity121 want to change the conversation from the cost of living crisis			0
they will talk about anything else			0
‘ we are going to show to people in 2014 how by standing up for the right people ... we can earn and grow our way to a higher standard of living for people			0
’ he adds : ‘ it matters so much now for people who can not afford to pay their gas bill or do the weekly shop			0
' and it matters so much for the future too because so many people are thinking what future is there in this country for kids , my son or daughter , my niece or nephew , how are we going to make a difference for them ? ’			0
