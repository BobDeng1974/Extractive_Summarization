@entity0 implored @entity1 to entertain him on his day out at @entity2 but he had to wait before @entity3 gloriously granted his wish by responding to the most testing situation with a maiden @entity7 century of rare class			1
the sacked star sat in a hospitality box like a modern day roman emperor in judgment on the new era as @entity14 came to @entity1 ’s rescue on a fourth day of this @entity17 series that displayed @entity7 cricket in all its glorious unpredictability			0
for much of the day @entity0 had watched @entity20 threaten to pull off an extraordinary first @entity7 victory but he was nowhere to be seen when @entity3 swung the spin of @entity23 high towards his @entity25 vantage point to reach his hundred with a six off the first ball of the day ’s final over			1
century : @entity3 celebrates his maiden test hundred after bringing it up with a six over mid-wicket what it means : @entity14 punches the sky after he tonked @entity23 over the mid-wicket boundary @entity36 : the @entity37 3 had no interest in ending the innings in the 90s when he whacked @entity23 into the deep digging in : while his team - mates struggled , @entity3 show composure with an important innings well handled : @entity1 no 3 @entity14 used the sweep shot to good effect against spinner @entity23 muted celebration : @entity14 raises his bat to the crowd after his hard - fought half - century on day four at @entity2 cue another joyous @entity53 celebration to add to that of first innings double centurion @entity55 and a position of dominance from which @entity1 can push for victory on monday even though they spent much of sunday on the back foot			1
only @entity1 , it seemed , could have forced anything other than a draw at the start of the day but from the moment @entity65 set a defensive field for the first over it was @entity20 who looked the more positive , proactive side			2
@entity0 had tweeted his hope that @entity1 would quickly take the last three @entity74 wickets and then hurry to a 380 lead but , when @entity20 claimed five victims in the middle session , a declaration was the last thing on @entity65 ’s mind			1
as it turned out @entity0 ’s demands were almost totally met but it was only when @entity3 and @entity83 joined forces that @entity65 was able again to think about dictating terms on what could be a fascinating last day			2
sunday was largely @entity20 ’s day , with captain @entity87 joining @entity88 on the @entity90 ’s honours board on his first test innings in this country and then @entity93 ripping the heart out of @entity1 ’s top order			2
yet it still ended with the hosts 389 ahead and surely poised to declare overnight and attack @entity20 on a pitch that finally started to give bowlers minimal assistance before @entity14 shifted the balance emphatically back in his side ’s favour			1
this was a big innings for @entity14 , even though he is only playing his second test , as @entity1 have asked a lot by elevating him to the all - important @entity112 position ahead of @entity113 and @entity55			2
he did little to suggest he would make it his own in the first innings but now , with real pressure on @entity1 , the @entity116 displayed a calm temperament and a strength off the back foot that should serve him well in test cricket			0
how 's that ? @entity20 's @entity23 ( centre ) roars with delight as he dismisses @entity126 skittled : opener @entity128 's off stump cartwheels as @entity1 lose quick wickets in their second innings @entity131 : @entity74 captain @entity87 celebrates reaching his century during day four how @entity1 needed him when they plunged to 121 for six after taking the last three @entity74 wickets in 70 minutes to give themselves a first innings lead of 122 in a first test where bat had dominated ball for the first three days			1
@entity93 , the quickest of this ‘ pop - gun ’ @entity74 attack , had shown the way to attack on this pitch with a superb spell from the @entity144 that saw him take three for three in 21 balls and threatened to turn this first test on its head			0
but , after @entity23 had further preyed on home nerves with two wickets of his own , an @entity53 batsman of @entity149 extraction showed a man in the stands who trod a similar path that the middle order is in safe hands			0
when @entity158 was the sixth @entity53 to fall @entity1 led by only 243 with a minimum of 125 overs left in the @entity7 , more than enough time for @entity20 to recover from conceding 575 in the first innings to go 1 - 0 up in this two - @entity7 series			2
bizarre : day four was most memorable for @entity165 's bizarre dismissal for @entity20 @entity166 : @entity1 's @entity83 bowled a short ball to @entity165 and it caught him off balance smash : @entity165 ended up dismissing himself by crashing into his own stumps , sending them sprawling out : @entity1 's @entity128 walks back to the pavilion after his dismissal for 19 runs at @entity2 but two of the men @entity1 hope will lead the @entity179 era then took over , with @entity14 initially playing second fiddle to @entity181 in their fortune changing stand of 78 but then adding another 57 with @entity184 in the dominant manner he has shown in becoming such a force in domestic cricket			1
only when he was on 36 did @entity14 have an anxious moment after @entity20 reviewed @entity191 ’s not out decision to a caught behind appeal			0
@entity193 , in particular , was furious when technology agreed with the on - field umpire but there was no sign of a @entity198 nor movement on @entity200			0
@entity3 , whose parents and brother flew over from @entity203 for this match , raced to his hundred before the close to save @entity65 an awkward choice on whether to bat on today and now @entity1 will hope their bowlers have enough time , with 17 overs in the match already lost to shoddy over-rates , to press home their advantage			1
‘ it was a great feeling , i ca n’t really describe it , ’ said @entity3 on going to his hundred with a six			0
‘ with an over to go i did n’t want to muddle around with singles			0
luckily i got a slog sweep out of the middle			0
’ it was a moment and method that @entity0 would surely have approved of			0
he 's back : @entity0 enjoys a beer while watching the @entity7 , his first return since being sacked laugh : @entity0 ( front right ) enjoys a joke with his friend , tv presenter @entity229 ( front left ) struggle : @entity1 's @entity126 is bowled as @entity1 struggle during their second innings contemplation : @entity1 head coach @entity235 is deep in thought as @entity1 struggle with the bat shot : @entity1 's @entity55 plays a stroke on day four but runs were hard to come by for @entity1 jump for joy : @entity83 leaps in celebration after taking the wicket of @entity244 gone : the @entity1 team rush to congratulate @entity83 at @entity2 after @entity244 's wicket dejected : @entity247 lies on the ground after dropping a catch as @entity1 laboured to get wickets			1
