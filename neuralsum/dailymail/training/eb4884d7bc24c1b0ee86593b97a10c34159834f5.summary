@entity1 secretary of state @entity0 was looking to strengthen ties with @entity3 as he tries to put an end to the dictatorial regime of @entity6 in @entity7 , but instead he was met with the coldest of receptions			1
@entity3 president @entity9 kept @entity0 waiting three hours before their meeting at the @entity12 on tuesday and continuously fiddled with his pen as the top @entity1 diplomat spoke about the ongoing crisis in @entity7			1
@entity0 ’s visit to @entity17 comes as he seeks @entity3 help in ending @entity7 's civil , telling president @entity9 that common interest in a stable @entity22 could bridge divisions among the big powers			1
the brush off : unlike the pomp and circumstance of most diplomatic visits , @entity3 president @entity9 kept @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 waiting for three hours before their appointed meeting time @entity9 , however , made no mention in his own public remarks of the conflict in @entity7 , which has generated some of the frostiest exchanges between @entity36 and @entity17 since the @entity37			1
yet with the killing now in a third year and no end in sight as @entity42 intervention remains stymied by international arguments , @entity0 struck a positive tone as he set about trying to narrow differences sufficiently to agree a plan for a settlement that proved out of reach at talks in @entity50 almost a year ago			0
' the @entity1 believes that we share some very significant common interests with respect to @entity7 - stability in the region , not having extremists creating problems throughout the region and elsewhere , ' @entity0 told @entity9			2
' we have both embraced in the @entity50 communiqué a common approach , so it 's my hope that today we 'll be able to dig in to that a little bit and see if we can find common ground			0
' keeping cordial : @entity9 and @entity0 shook hands , but some other actions spoke louder , like his constant fiddling with his pen when @entity0 spoke about the cooperation needed to take action against @entity6 the @entity1 and @entity3 endorsed a plan in @entity50 last june that called for the creation of a transitional government in @entity7 , where at least 70,000 people have now been killed since march 2011 , but which left open the question of what would happen to @entity7 president @entity6			1
long - time arms supplier to @entity6 and suspicious of @entity78 aid for opponents of authoritarian leaders around the world , @entity17 says @entity6 's departure must not be a precondition for a dialogue among @entity7 to end the conflict			1
@entity3 , backed by @entity86 , has refused @entity78 appeals to consider sanctions on @entity6 , vetoing three @entity90 resolutions condemning his crackdown on opposition groups			2
the @entity1 are reluctant to give military aid directly to an insurgency that includes militant islamists but alarmed that violence is continuing and may spread			0
the superpower is making a new push for a joint international approach to contain the conflict			0
@entity101 : @entity0 has been pushing for @entity3 to help out , saying that it is just one of a handful of upcoming issues that are of mutual interest but he has yet to commit poker faces : the @entity1 is trying to get @entity3 to act with them against the dictatorial @entity6 regime in @entity7 but the @entity3 leader has refused to publicly condemn the @entity7 leader @entity113 air strikes in @entity7 have heightened a sense of urgency in a region strained by confrontations between @entity6 's ally @entity118 and other @entity120 powers , as well as the hostility between @entity113 and its neighbors , notably @entity118 and @entity123			1
differences over @entity7 have deepened strains in ties between the @entity1 and @entity3 that are also hampered by what @entity36 views as a crackdown on @entity3 civil society since @entity9 began a third term as president a year ago after the biggest protests since he first rose to power in 2000			2
making the rounds : @entity0 toured @entity135 in @entity17 during his visit , which is meant to be one to shore up @entity3 support @entity0 's visit is intended to help improve relations and pave the way @entity141 to hold talks with @entity9 in september , when @entity3 hosts a summit of the @entity145 nations			1
@entity141 and @entity9 are also to meet at a @entity147 summit in @entity148 in june			0
@entity0 is publicly trying to hint how there are many issues on the table - including ‘ @entity154 , @entity118 , @entity7 ’ and economic cooperation - that could be good working ground for @entity1 - @entity3 relations			2
@entity9 , a former @entity155 spy who accused @entity36 of helping foment protests against him last year , was less effusive than @entity0 but said he was glad to see him in @entity17 and expressed hope that relations would improve			0
both sides have said they hope to increase cooperation on counter-terrorism following the @entity163 bombings , which @entity1 officials suspect were carried out by two ethnic @entity165 who once lived in @entity3			2
' we recently had a substantial phone conversation with president @entity141			0
and we had an opportunity to discuss many aspects of our relations , ' @entity9 said			0
' i think it is very important that our key ministries , our foreign ministries and agencies , work together to resolve the acutest issues of the modern world			0
