by @entity0 published : 16:01 est , 2 june 2012 updated : 03:50 est , 3 june 2012 @entity1 confessed to burning the body of dead baby to protect the health of @entity6 staff a @entity6 bodyguard has confessed to burning the body of a baby on a funeral pyre made of rubbish after the 2004 tsunami – because he considered it a threat to the health of his reporting team			1
@entity1 , 52 , discovered the body outside the house in @entity18 , @entity19 , where he was staying with journalist @entity20 and his production team as they covered the aftermath of the disaster			1
but instead of reporting it to the local authorities , he burned the body of the boy and swore two other witnesses , including @entity6 producer @entity30 , to secrecy			1
there is no suggestion that mr @entity20 knew about the incident			1
writing in his new book bodyguard : my life on @entity37 , @entity1 compared the body to an obstacle such as a ‘ blocked toilet ’			1
‘ i pride myself in my work , ’ writes @entity1 , now head of security at @entity42			1
‘ nobody got sick on that trip			1
nobody even came close to diarrhoea and i knew that i had done my job keeping everyone else healthy			1
i ran a tight ship ensuring everyone always washed their hands with wet wipes			1
‘ the baby was an obstacle to their health ; the next day it would be a blocked toilet			1
i had n’t known it was coming but i had to deal with it and i would do the same again			1
’ the revelation comes four months after the @entity6 ’s @entity65 , @entity66 , and head of safety , ex-army officer @entity64 , tried to persuade @entity1 not to publish the biography			1
according to the bodyguard , they summoned him to a meeting in january after he sent them a draft copy of the manuscript , and asked him to abandon the project			1
it is not known what they objected to within the book – although the confession does not paint the @entity81 in a good light			1
@entity1 , a former commando , served with @entity83 in the @entity84 and @entity85 before being appointed the @entity81 ’s safety and security adviser in 2001 , working with the @entity88 – which ‘ provides advice to programme - makers deploying to hostile or dangerous environments ’			1
bodyguard : mr @entity1 spent 10 years accompanying journalists to war zones and scenes of natural disasters he spent ten years accompanying journalists to war zones and scenes of natural disaster , working with reporters including @entity101 and @entity102			2
he was with @entity103 , in @entity104 in 2003 , when their vehicle was blown up and their translator killed			2
it was also his brief to look after celebrities – including , on occasion , sir @entity112 , @entity113 and @entity114			2
@entity1 , who also carried out undercover operations for the @entity6 , left @entity81 last july , after accepting redundancy , and now works as @entity42 ’s @entity117			1
it was on january 7 , 2005 , 12 days after the tsunami , when he woke at dawn to find the body of the baby boy , aged between one and two , with matted black hair and closed eyes , lying on the doorstep			1
‘ there had to be a reason for this , ’ he writes in his book			1
‘ this was n’t random or down to chance – someone had specifically left this baby at what they knew to be the @entity6 house			1
’ yet instead of informing anybody in the house , or contacting the local authorities , @entity1 took matters into his own hands			2
‘ i picked it up with my bare hands and looked around , ’ he added			2
aftermath : the 2004 @entity146 claimed more 230,000 lives			2

i walked over to the rubbish , which night after night would pile high in the streets waiting for the authorities to burn the next day by the side of the roads to stave off the threat of rats			2
removing some cardboard from the tip , i covered the baby with it			2
‘ i heard a voice say , “ what ’s that @entity1 ? ” it was @entity174 , the @entity175 paramedic who was staying next door to us			2
he did n’t need me to answer			2
“ what are you going to do ? ” he asked			2
‘ my response was instant and came from the mouth of a soldier in the zone and on autopilot			2
my sole priority was to protect the @entity6 crew from infection			2
‘ “ i ’m going to burn it , ” i answered			0
“ that ’s the best thing to do			0
” ’ @entity174 went to get some petrol from a jerrycan as @entity1 laid the baby on a box in the centre of the rubbish			0
the @entity6 bodyguard then soaked the body in petrol and set fire to it			0
when the flames burned down ten minutes later , the two men bagged up the smouldering rubbish			0
two women comforting each other in @entity149 's southern @entity207 on the first anniversary of the tsunami ‘ i did n’t look to see the remains of the baby , ’ @entity1 writes , ‘ both our heads were looking down while shovelling			1
we just got on with it			0
we may have left a skull on the floor – i ca n’t recall			1
i just wanted it done			0
’ the incident was witnessed by @entity6 producer @entity30 , who was standing in the doorway of the house used by the @entity81 ’s staff			0
‘ i had no choice but to come clean , ’ @entity1 continued			0
‘ i told him we had to keep this to ourselves – i did n’t want anyone else to find out			0
“ i wondered what all the flies were , ” he replied			0
“ how do you feel about it ? ” ‘ “ it ’s a sad situation but i am surprised someone has dumped it on our doorstep , ” i answered bluntly			1
only years later did @entity30 confess that he had told a couple of people – he also said he was grateful and could n’t have done the same thing			0
’ @entity1 remains convinced that he did the right thing that day			0
justifying his behaviour , he writes : ‘ i was working and this was the job i had to do			0
if they were still alive , i could n’t give the parents that closure because there were no clues on the baby			0
i did n’t know how it got here but i felt sure it was orphaned and deliberately dumped			0
i could n’t change its fate			0
i did what i had to do			0
there were no alternatives but to cremate the baby			0
two elephants clear the debris of houses damaged by the tsunami disaster to make a path for vehicles in @entity19 's tsunami - hit city of @entity18 on january 3 , 2005 ‘ it was the most humane thing to do before it became riddled with maggots and was left to rot in the street			1
i could n’t put a sign up outside the house saying : “ one ex-baby here – please knock			0
’ ’ ‘ if the parents had n’t died , why would it be dumped ? ’ last night @entity1 told @entity272 : ‘ at the time we felt it was the easiest and most humane thing to do			0
there were a quarter of a million dead people there and the majority were being dumped in open pits			0
‘ the baby was completely unidentifiable – it was infested with maggots and there were no features on it at all			0
’ a @entity6 spokeswoman said last night : ‘ it ’s his account , which he has put into context			0
‘ from our point of view , we do n’t have anything to say			0
we do n’t discuss private conversations but managers sometimes talk to staff , or former staff , who have written books about the @entity6 – particularly if there are legal or safety issues			0
’ last night @entity30 did not wish to comment and @entity20 did not respond to calls .			1
