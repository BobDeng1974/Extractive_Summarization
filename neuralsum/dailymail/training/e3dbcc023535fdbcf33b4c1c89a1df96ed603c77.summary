after tackling @entity2 ’s unhealthy school dinners , @entity0 has turned his attention to a new scandal of ‘ criminal ’ proportions			1
the celebrity chef says thousands of tonnes of wonky fruit and vegetables are being thrown away every year because supermarkets do not want to buy imperfect produce – and @entity2 do not want to eat it			1
during an investigation for a new tv show , @entity0 said the amount of misshapen food cast aside was ‘ bonkers ’			1
they are pictured with actress @entity30 , who is set to appear in the first episode now , @entity32 has agreed to launch a trial selling ‘ ugly ’ vegetables at a discounted price to see if customers will bite			1
the new ‘ @entity38 ’ range will be sold in - store for a third less than more attractive produce , in a bid to support farmers who might otherwise have to throw it away			1
the initiative was sparked by an investigation into food waste by @entity0 and farmer @entity20 for @entity23 ’s @entity24 , which airs tomorrow night			1
the first programme shows farmers complaining that they can not sell tonnes of perfectly edible fruit and vegetables because they are oddly - shaped			0
they asked @entity32 to carry out an in - store trial to see if customers would be willing to buy lumpy carrots and potatoes and knobbly apples and pears if they were cheaper			1
it will be launched on january 26 , with the aim of rolling it out nationwide if it proves popular			0
the @entity2 ’s second largest supermarket said its own survey showed two - thirds of customers would be open to buying wonky produce while three - quarters would ‘ definitely ’ do so if it was cheaper			1
according to the @entity63 , @entity0 , 39 , said : ‘ if most @entity65 had half an idea of the amount going to waste , they ’d be snapping up ugly veg by the trolley load			2
thousands of tonnes of fruit and vegetables are being thrown away every year by supermarkets as they believe their customers do not want to buy imperfect produce ‘ there ’s no difference whatsoever in taste or nutritional value			1
‘ this is perfectly good food that could and should be eaten by humans			1
‘ when half a million people in the @entity2 are relying on food banks , this waste is n’t just bonkers – it ’s bordering on criminal			2
’ it is the latest crusade for the @entity89 - born chef who , a decade ago , launched his campaign against high - calorie school meals			2
for his @entity94 series in 2005 , he visited a school in south - east @entity96 , and insisted it scrap @entity97 and chips in favour of healthy foods such as fish and broccoli			0
this led to the wider @entity94 campaign , which prompting new @entity106 guidance on school dinners nationwide			0
in 2009 , the @entity108 scrapped controversial rules which prevented misshapen produce being sold in @entity111			0
under the bizarre @entity114 rules , bananas had to be ‘ free of abnormal curvature ’ and at least 14cm in length , while @entity118 cucumbers had to be ‘ practically straight ’			0
the draconian law meant up to a fifth of all fruit and vegetables produced was being rejected by shops because they failed to meet the required standards			0
supermarket chain @entity32 claims that its customers appear to be coming around to the idea of imperfect produce such as unusual shaped carrots , left , and misshapen peppers , right when it was axed six years ago , the @entity114 's then - agriculture commissioner called it ‘ a new dawn for the curvy cucumber and the knobbly carrot ’			1
but despite the changes , imperfect fruit and vegetables remains a rarity on the shelves of @entity2 ’s major supermarkets – something farmers blame on the retailers			0
now @entity32 claims that its customers appear to be coming around to the idea of imperfect produce			2
@entity144 , of @entity32 , said : ‘ even if fruit and veg have some knobbles and blemishes , this does n’t affect the quality or taste – a carrot is still a carrot			1
‘ customers are simply looking for great - tasting , fresh produce at a value price			2
‘ our growers are savvy and already use a large percentage of this wonky crop for further processing , for things like ready meals and juicing , but we saw an opportunity to extend this even more			0
’ in tonight ’s programme , which starts at 8pm , @entity0 and @entity20 will meet farmers @entity167 and @entity169 , who have been growing carrots and parsnips in @entity172 for more than 50 years			0
@entity20 said : ‘ anything that does n’t make the grade gets chucked			0
it ’s a massive waste for farmers			0
‘ where ‘ a ’ grade carrots sell for £ 800 a tonne , they practically give the ugly ones away for animal feed for just £ 10			2

celebrity chef says good produce is being thrown away as it is ' wonky '
adds that it is ' criminal ' that thousands of tons are being cast aside
says there 's no difference in taste or nutritional value of misshapen food
