by @entity0 , political editor published : 10:53 est , 12 may 2013 updated : 18:51 est , 12 may 2013 under pressure : deputy prime minister @entity2 only blocked key @entity4 policies to bolster his own support against a @entity7 coup , claims @entity8 @entity2 ’s leadership of the @entity10 was in turmoil yesterday as @entity8 claimed he was blocking key @entity4 policies purely to head off a plot to have him replaced by @entity7			1
the @entity13 suggested that the deputy prime minister ’s threat to veto childcare reforms last week was an attempt to ‘ show a bit of leg ’ from a leader desperate to cheer up his own party rather than a principled objection			1
@entity10 sources dismissed mr @entity8 ’s claims as ‘ loopy ’ , but he insisted the party ’s former @entity26 spokesman @entity25 was behind attempts to have mr @entity2 ousted in favour of business secretary mr cable , his friend and ally			1
defence secretary @entity32 upped the pressure by agreeing it was clear that mr @entity7 , who suggested yesterday he was not too old for high office despite turning 70 last week , was an ‘ ambitious and distinctive ’ figure			1
some @entity37 are privately in favour of mr @entity2 being removed before the next election and replaced with mr @entity7			1
they say only a break with the past under a new leader is likely to help the @entity10 recover sufficiently to head off the threat from @entity45 in their northern seats and help prevent it from winning other @entity4 / @entity45 marginals			0
mr @entity2 has objected to a number of @entity4 policies in recent months , including mr @entity8 ’s attempts to scrap gcses and bring back the o - level and an extension of secret courts			1
last week , the deputy prime minister said he was also against plans to allow some nurseries to relax the ratio of adults to children in an attempt to bring down costs for working couples			1
in remarks that will open up new divisions in the @entity67 , mr @entity8 said yesterday it was clear mr @entity2 was trying to derail another previously agreed government proposal because of party politics			2
vowing the reforms drawn up by his childcare minister , @entity72 , would go ahead with minor ‘ tweaks ’ , mr @entity8 said : ‘ i do n’t think we can understand @entity2 ’s position without also appreciating the position that he ’s in because of internal @entity10 politics			1
‘ there ’s a campaign being run at the moment being led by @entity25 , this @entity10 in the @entity81 , to try to destabilise @entity2 because @entity25 wants @entity7 to succeed him			2
and @entity2 understandably needs to show @entity10 he ’s fighting hard			0
’ talking politics : education secretary @entity8 spoke out against @entity2 on the @entity82 under fire : prime minister @entity84 is under pressure to push through childcare reform , despite @entity2 's objections mr @entity8 said mr @entity2 was a ‘ reasonable guy ’ and he believed he would agree to a compromise on childcare			1
‘ @entity25 is on manoeuvres , he ’s trying to promote @entity7 , ’ he added			0
‘ it ’s understandable that within the @entity10 these things go on			0
@entity2 has to show a bit of leg , as it were , on these issues			2
‘ but we ’ve seen these situations arise in the past and we ’ve managed to resolve them in the national interest			0
’ front line : @entity7 , who turned 70 last week , says he has no intention of stepping away from politics			2
friends describe him as ' ambitious ' from september , the ratio for under - ones had been due to rise from three per adult to four in pre-schools that want to take part			0
each adult would be able to look after six two - year - olds instead of four			0
a government analysis suggests relaxing the rules would reduce costs by 12 per cent , saving the average parent £ 1,329 a year per child in full - time care			0
@entity84 is under growing pressure to overrule mr @entity2 and implement the reforms , which do not need legislation , despite his objections			2
mr @entity8 ’s intervention , an unprecedented attack on mr @entity2 by a @entity4 minister , caused deep anger in @entity10 ranks			2
a senior @entity10 source said : ‘ we appreciate that @entity8 has ambitions of his own and is keen to distract attention from his party ’s divisions on @entity133			0
‘ but he knows our concerns are based on the overwhelmingly negative response from experts and parents to the government ’s consultation			0
’ @entity25 said it was ‘ old news ’ that he preferred mr @entity7 to mr @entity2 , ‘ but there ’s no plot – members decide who leads us ’			1
a source close to the business secretary said : ‘ it seems clear the only person with leadership ambitions is @entity8			0

@entity13 said deputy prime minister 's threat to veto childcare reforms was an attempt to ' show a bit of leg '
@entity8 claims @entity2 's leadership is under pressure from those who favour @entity7
suggested former @entity26 spokesman @entity25 was behind attempts to replace mr @entity2
mr @entity7 , who turned 70 last week , described as ' an ambitious man '
