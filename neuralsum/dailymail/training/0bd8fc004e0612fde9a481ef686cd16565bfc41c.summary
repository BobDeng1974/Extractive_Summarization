the @entity96 senator , chairman of the @entity97 , did not offer any evidence that victims had been targeted			0
major player : mr @entity0 's empire includes @entity61 , the @entity64 and the @entity65 in its portfolio but in a statement , he said : ' i encourage the appropriate authorities to investigate to ensure that @entity40 have not had their privacy violated			1
' the reported hacking by @entity1 newspapers against a range of individuals - including children - is offensive and a serious breach of journalistic ethics			0
' this raises serious questions about whether the company has broken @entity40 law			1
' a second senator - @entity75 - urged authorities to examine whether or not @entity1 had violated the @entity76 , which makes it illegal for a @entity40 company to pay foreign officials to obtain or retain business			2
in a letter to regulators , he wrote : ' further investigation may reveal that current reports only scratch the surface of the problem at @entity1			0
' @entity130 , chief executive of @entity85 , said : ' @entity40 also need to know whether our privacy was violated by @entity0 reporters searching for a good scoop to sell news			2
breach of ethics : a private investigator in @entity18 has alleged he was contacted by @entity21 reporters wanting 9/11 victims ' phone numbers and details of calls made around the terror attacks on the @entity145 and @entity146 ' we ca n't rely on @entity1 , with is record of mismanagement , to address the problem			1
we must take proactive steps to protect our privacy from @entity1 's mismanagement			0
' @entity0 's cover - up is falling apart , with serious consequences for hacking victims and @entity1 shareholders alike			1

earlier this week a former @entity18 policeman now working as a private investigator alleged he was contacted by @entity21 journalists wanting 9/11 victims ' phone numbers and details of the calls they had made and received in the days leading up to the attack			1
empire : mr @entity0 's media business also includes the @entity51 , @entity172 and @entity173 in @entity51 a source said : ' this investigator is used by a lot of journalists in @entity40 and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims ' private phone data			1
' he said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their relatives			0
' his presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the relevant voicemails , just like it has been shown they have done in the @entity26			0
' the @entity193 said he had to turn the job down			0
he knew how insensitive such research would be , and how bad it would look			0
' the investigator said the journalists seemed particularly interested in getting the phone records belonging to the @entity26 victims of the attacks			2
' members of the family which used to control the @entity64 have said they would not have voted to sell the newspaper to @entity0 if they had realised the full extent of @entity207 's phone - hacking scandal			1
@entity0 bought the newspaper in august 2007 , six months after the @entity21 's royal editor , @entity208 , was jailed for voicemail hacking - but at the time @entity207 said the practice was confined only to @entity208			1
today @entity212 , part of the family that used to control @entity214 , the @entity64 's publishers , said : ' if i had known what i know now , i would have pushed harder against [ the bid ]			0
' mr @entity212 , who at the time had sole voting control over a trust which represented 13 per cent of @entity214 shares , said he would have ' held out ' if he 'd known			0
another relative , @entity223 , said ' it would have been harder , if not impossible ' to have accepted the bid if she had known the full extent of the scandal			0
she told @entity228 : ' the ethics are clear to me - what 's been revealed , from what i 've read in the @entity64 , is terrible			0
it may even be criminal			0
' some members of the @entity212 family say they would have voted the same way even if they knew about the scandal			0
@entity238 said he ' probably would have thought twice about it but probably would have sold ' , although he said the scandal made him ' sick to my stomach '			0
even at the time of the sale , the deal with @entity207 proved contentious , and the family recruited an independent panel to keep an eye on the newspaper 's ethics			0
the boss of @entity1 's @entity51 division – which owns eight of the 12 major papers down under - announced it was investigating all payments it has made for stories over the last three years as the hacking scandal spread			2
@entity256 , in an email to staff , said it was ' offensive ' to link them to the @entity262 scandal and said there was ' absolutely no reason to believe ' they were involved in any wrongdoing			0
but he added : ' we will be conducting a thorough review of all editorial expenditure over the past three years to confirm that payments to contributors and other third parties were for legitimate services			0
' @entity274 took his campaign against mr @entity0 's newspaper empire to the @entity277			1
the actor appeared on @entity40 's most watched breakfast tv program , @entity280 , warning viewers the scandal could well spread there			2
' i would 've thought it would be of interest to @entity40 's because @entity0 does own an enormous amount of your media , with @entity61 and stations , and @entity63 , and some of your newspapers , he told viewers			2
scandal : the @entity1 hq is in @entity18			0
pressure groups are calling for civil and criminal investigations into the media group ' i think people need to ask themselves , " who is this man who owns such a large part of our media ? " ' and when you hear some of the new allegations that may include hacking of some of the 9/11 victims , that may strike a chord with @entity40			1
' it comes as mr @entity0 's grand plan for a further expansion of his media empire was in tatters last night as the ' firestorm ’ over phone hacking forced him to withdraw his bid to take over @entity317			1
the tycoon shelved his £ 10billion offer for the satellite broadcaster as it became clear that @entity26 prime minister @entity324 , along with party leaders @entity321 and @entity323 , were joining forces in a @entity327 vote urging him to back off			2
mr @entity324 also relented in the face of intense pressure from @entity330 and the @entity331 and agreed to a judicial inquiry into press standards , regulation and ownership , and allegations of illegal phone hacking by the @entity21 and police corruption			1
media proprietors , including mr @entity0 , as well as senior politicians , police chiefs and journalists accused of phone hacking , are all expected to be summoned under oath			1
