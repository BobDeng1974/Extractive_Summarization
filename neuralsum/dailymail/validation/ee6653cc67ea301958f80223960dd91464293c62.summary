her boyfriend ’s dreary taste in furnishings is said to be the spark that first set @entity5 off in pursuit of all things white			1
faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery in his flat in @entity14 , @entity15 , she rushed to the shops to find replacements in more neutral tones , but struggled when it came to buying good quality bed linen in the purest of whites			2
she did n’t know it at the time , of course , but that day in 1993 marked the moment @entity5 began to dream of setting up a shop selling everything in white			1
her business sells everything from £ 20 scented candles to £ 200 cashmere jumpers , and while she has branched out to shades such as ‘ biscuit marl ’ and ‘ cloud grey ’ , @entity5 remains obsessed with all things pale			1
her white revolution has seen sales soaring at her 53 high street stores — even the @entity53 has sent out her ladies - in - waiting to buy bedspreads — and has spread across the @entity56 where she launched a @entity58 website last year			2
latest figures show that the mother - of - four ’s company made pre-tax profits of £ 6.5 million last year — an increase of 38 per cent			2
her position on the @entity65 has climbed steeply from 427th to 326th			0
she and her husband ’s combined wealth is estimated at £ 295 million			2
aside from the money pouring into company coffers , @entity5 owns three stunning properties , all decorated from roof to floor in her trademark sweeping white interiors			1
there ’s a £ 12.5 million 17th - century manor house in @entity77 , set in 51 acres of parkland , a £ 4 million townhouse in @entity15 ’s fashionable @entity80 and what is widely regarded to be the finest property in the @entity83 , @entity84 , a luxury chalet with full - time staff which @entity5 rents out for a staggering £ 26,000 a week			1
@entity5 , pictured at her @entity77 home , realised she had found a gap in the market when she was looking to decorate her future husband 's house all in white even at @entity5 ’s main residence , the country mansion , the only flashes of colour you ’ll see are the bright pony rosettes awarded to her horse - mad daughters			1
all in all , it ’s a rather surprising state of affairs for a woman who disappointed her parents by leaving school at 16 with six o - levels and signing up at the @entity105 finishing school which promised to prepare girls for marriage , society and ‘ the season ’			0
however , it was not long before @entity5 decided she wanted to do something more interesting with her life than flutter her eyelashes at eligible young bachelors on the @entity15 social circuit			1
indeed , the statuesque blonde ’s path to fortune is rather more colourful than her dazzling white shops might suggest			2
@entity122 , as she was named by her parents , was born in 1968 into an illustrious military family — her maternal grandfather , sir @entity124 , was commander - in - chief of @entity125 in @entity126 and a recipient of the @entity128 and @entity129			0
the daughter of commodity broker , @entity132 , @entity5 , as she was known , grew up in @entity133 and attended £ 5,275 - a - term @entity134 in @entity133			1
her parents divorced , and aged seven , she and her younger sister , @entity135 , went with their mother @entity136 , a horse breeder , to live with their new step - father , estate agent @entity138			0
those days , she recalled , were happy but chaotic			0
‘ my mother was really only interested in her horses , ’ she said , ‘ so the stables were immaculate , the house a tip. ’ @entity5 's husband , @entity146 ( pictured ) , set up his shirt company , @entity147 , in 1986 while a geography student at @entity149 it was all a far cry from the vision @entity5 would later create of domestic interiors as a haven of white and light			1
her early ambitions lay in fashion			0
while at @entity157 she studied dressmaking and design			0
but as a teenager in @entity15 in the @entity161 , @entity5 seemed intent on immersing herself in a ‘ @entity163 ’ lifestyle			1
in 1987 , she was a debutante at the @entity166 ’s @entity165 , where she and fellow socialite and fashion journalist @entity168 were among a select bunch of girls chosen by judges including hairdresser @entity172 and fashion designer @entity173 to appear in the @entity174			0
even at @entity5 and @entity177 's home in @entity77 ( pictured ) you will see only flashes of colour , mainly in the bright pony rosettes awarded to their horse - mad daughters wedding dress designer @entity183 , who was also on the judging panel , recalls that even among the ‘ incredibly beautiful , leggy ’ girls who paraded in front of her , desperate to be picked , 18 - year - old @entity5 stood out			1
cannily , she used her introduction to @entity188 to ask for work experience			0
‘ @entity5 used to come every day , ’ says @entity190			1
‘ she was completely different from the other debutantes			0
she was incredibly hard - working with no airs and graces			0
’ however , @entity5 decided that life as a designer was not what she wanted after all			1
she began work at @entity198 , the owner of several glossy magazines including @entity201 and @entity202 , first as a receptionist , then as a fashion assistant			0
she enrolled on a journalism course , later describing it as a ‘ complete waste of time ’ , and flitted from there to @entity210 , where she worked as a @entity212 girl			0
she was poached from there by @entity216 & @entity53 ’s health and beauty editor @entity214 in 1991			0
@entity214 recalls : ‘ she was so efficient and impressive , i said : “ are you interested in coming to work for me ? ” she dropped off her cv at 5am			0
i was so struck by her ability to be focused and unflappable that i hired her as my assistant			0
she has a great humility about her , which i find extraordinary , bearing in mind she is so successful			0
’ by the time she met her future husband , @entity5 was still struggling to work out exactly what she wanted to do with her life			1
but although she fell in love with @entity230 , she did not feel the same way about his taste in interiors			0
@entity5 ( pictured ) used a £ 6,000 legacy from her grandmother to launch @entity29 in march 1994 according to @entity5 herself : ‘ i thought ; “ this is my chance			1
i ’ll show him what excellent wife material i am			0
” so i went shopping and kitted it out — i bought white bed linen , white towels , white china , white napkins and white bathrobes			2
but i just found it impossible to buy plain white sheets on the @entity249			1
‘ the only place you could get them was in department stores and shopping there was a horrible experience			0
all the salesgirls would look at you snootily , as if to say : “ you ca n’t afford this			0
” ’ while @entity5 believed she had spotted a hole in the market , her husband - to - be was perfectly placed to advise her when it came to launching her own business			1
@entity5 ( pictured ) grew up in @entity133 and attended £ 5,275 - a - term @entity134 before going on to the @entity105 finishing school @entity230 had set up his shirt company , @entity147 , in 1986 while a geography student at @entity149			1
‘ i do n’t think i would have done it if it had n’t been for @entity177 , ’ @entity5 later claimed			1
‘ he guided me through the process , helped me write my first business plan			0
’ she began by calling up @entity15 department stores , pretending to be a journalist writing articles on homeware while ascertaining that up to 50 per cent of their sales involved white linen			2
she also quizzed @entity279 , manufacturers and friends			0
@entity5 ( left ) was inspired to start @entity29 in 1993 after being faced with the fusty brown and burgundy upholstery of her future husband , @entity177 's ( right ) flat in @entity14 , @entity15 ‘ my mission was to bridge the gap between first - class designer quality and what was affordable without the big designer margins , ’ she has said			1
@entity5 used a £ 6,000 legacy from her grandmother to launch @entity29 in march 1994			1
@entity230 gave her £ 5,000 in return for a 25 per cent stake , and she also received a £ 50 - a - week enterprise grant			2
she produced her first mail - order catalogue , a 12 - page leaflet , on a computer in @entity230 ’s attic , delivering her first orders in her sister @entity302			0
the company was an instant hit , turning over £ 258,000 in its first year , but @entity5 remained committed to hard graft , working 16 - hour days , right up until the birth of her first child			1
@entity5 is pictured here at home with her children ; @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 and @entity313 , when they were younger since then , @entity29 has gone from strength to strength			1
in 2010 , @entity5 was made an mbe for services to the retail industry , attracting mirth among some palace officials because of the black outfit that she wore to receive the honour at @entity324			1
she and her husband — together with their four children aged from ten to 18 — now reap the rewards of their entrepreneurial spirt			0
they almost split up when he failed to propose during a romantic holiday in @entity333 the year @entity5 launched her business			2
upon returning to the @entity35 , a feisty @entity5 gave him his marching orders , storming into his office and returning his £ 5,000 investment in cash			1
in 2010 , @entity5 was made an mbe for services to the retail industry ( pictured ) attracting mirth among some palace officials thanks to her all black outfit a shell - shocked @entity230 left the money on the roof of his sports car and drove off without it			2
when the couple did finally marry in 1995 , @entity5 gave him back one per cent of the company as a wedding gift			2
as a 99 per cent stake - holder , however , it is @entity5 who remains at the head of a retail empire which has revolutionised tastes in home furnishings , a woman who continues to live and breathe the colour that made her a multi-millionaire			1
‘ for me , white is timeless and always very relevant , ’ she insists			2
‘ wherever you live , whatever your style , white works			2
’ additional reporting : @entity365			0

@entity5 was inspired by her boyfriend 's house in 1993
