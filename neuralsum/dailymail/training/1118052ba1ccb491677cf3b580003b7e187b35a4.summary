she had also been to on a trip to @entity22 's holiest city , she told them			0

' ' she went to live in care homes and it did n't go well			2
she was naughty so they did n't want her any more			0

@entity111 : police photos of @entity8 , who has fled abroad , and her husband , who was killed by police chilling : a video of @entity6 emerged after he had killed four hostages at a kosher deli in @entity25 @entity6 appeared to suffer profound guilt and anger after his classmate @entity124 was shot in the back five times as the friends tried to flee police on the grim estate , the dead boy 's lawyer told @entity7 today			1

the @entity61 family condemned last weeks attacks as ' horrific ' and , although they did n't believe @entity8 was involved , they said they were ' disappointed ' that she had gone to @entity11 ' as it showed how much she had changed '			1
her foster brother said that the @entity61 family were closer to her than her real family and could not believe she had anything to do with the attacks last week : ' we were in shock when we saw her on tv - we were really upset			1
' brief stay : for two nights in @entity179 , @entity8 , who has been described as armed and dangerous , slept in room 102 – where a picture of the @entity183 hangs above the bed no - frills : the jihadi widow checked into @entity187 in @entity188 , on the @entity190 side of the city , on january 2 after flying into @entity179 ’s @entity193 airport basic : the room came with a shabby bathroom , a tv , a double and single bed - and a picture of the @entity183 on the wall ' we could n't believe it			1
we consider her our daughter and sister			0
we do n't understand because when she was young , she worked hard , she had good grades			0

when police arrived his friend fled and was shot in the back five times by a police officer who was still an intern			0
the lawyer said he believed the event played ' a huge part ' in his personal history and was a very important element in the person he became later			0
he said : ' when he saw his best friend being killed by police officer he reacted with various emotions , firstly guilt because he knew he did something wrong			0
' the second feeling was that of injustice because the police reaction was disproportionate and illegitimate and the third is the feeling of discrimination towards himself and young people like him from two major institutions , the police that killed his friend illegitimately and the justice system that did n't do their job			2
