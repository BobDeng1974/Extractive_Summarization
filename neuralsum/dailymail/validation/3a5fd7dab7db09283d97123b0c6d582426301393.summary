a stray dog who lost his nose after he accidentally caught it in a snare could soon be able to smell again thanks to surgeons who are planning to insert a specially designed implant into his snout			1
@entity8 , from @entity9 , @entity10 , will undergo surgery tomorrow in order to receive his new nose , which was designed by @entity10 company @entity15			1
the tube shaped implant - which was specially built for @entity18 following a ct scan - was invented by dr @entity20 from the @entity21 , after he heard of the dog 's plight			1
@entity18 ( pictured ) a stray dog from @entity9 , @entity10 , lost his nose after he accidentally caught it in a snare - but he could soon be able to smell again thanks to surgeons who will implant a chip in his snout tomorrow the implant was specially designed for @entity18 by dr @entity20 ( pixtured ) from @entity21 veterinarians will insert the implant during surgery to reconstruct @entity18 ' nose tomorrow			1
he will then be sent home to recover with his new owner , @entity36 , in @entity9 , and his new nose			0
it is hoped the implant will not only restore his sense of smell , but help reconstruct the shape of his nose which was left disfigured by the accident			2
noses are particularly important to dogs as their brains are dominated by an olfactory cortex , boasting millions of smelling receptors which help them to survive			0
the implant for the dog 's new nose was designed and created ( process pictured ) by @entity10 company @entity15 it is hoped the implant will not only restore his sense of smell , but help reconstruct the shape of his nose parys with his new owner @entity36 , in @entity9 , @entity10 today - the day before his surgery while the human brain is dominated by a large visual cortex , dog 's brains are dominated by an olfactory cortex			1
the olfactory bulb in dogs is roughly forty times bigger than the olfactory bulb in humans the average dog has 125 to 220 million smell - sensitive receptors			2
the bloodhound exceeds this standard with nearly 300 million receptors			0
it is estimated that dogs in general have an olfactory sense ranging from one hundred thousand to one million times more sensitive than a human 's			0
in some dog breeds , such as bloodhounds , the olfactory sense may be up to 100 million times greater than a human 's			0
a dog 's wet nose , or rhinarium , is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell			2
the mucus on a dog ’s nose helps capture scent particles - which is why they lick their dry noses , to recover this scent capturing			0
by smelling a drop of another dog 's urine , a dog can often determine the dog ’s sex , diet , health , and emotional state			0
the implant will be used to reconstruct the former stray 's nose after he lost it in a snare this small implant could change the stray dog 's life forever by returning his ability to smell again			1

parys the dog lost his nose after accidentally getting caught in snare
stray dog was left without his sense of smell following the *incident*
*scientist* has designed a special implant that will help @entity18 sniff again
@entity133 - who now has a new owner - will undergo the surgery tomorrow
