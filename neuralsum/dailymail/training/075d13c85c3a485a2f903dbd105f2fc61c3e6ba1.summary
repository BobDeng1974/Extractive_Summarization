danger zone : @entity1 came close to whipping a fellow actor for real during the filming of 12 years a slave @entity1 remembered that for such a dark moment it was a very hot , beautiful day ‘ and blue sky as far as the eye could see ’			1
the award - winning actor was in @entity10 , @entity11 , where he had to act in a scene for @entity14 ’s masterpiece , @entity13			1
@entity1 portrays the real - life @entity15 , a freeman who was abducted and sold into slavery			1
all of a sudden , every - thing he ’d held dear — his wife , his children , his name and his freedom — were stripped from him			1
he was someone else ’s property			1
the scene i ’m referring to involves @entity27 as @entity28 — a cruel , @entity30 - quoting plantation owner — @entity31 ’s @entity15 and @entity32 ( played by @entity33 ) , known as the @entity34 for her high cotton - picking yields , who is forced to satisfy ‘ the predilections and peculiarities ’ of @entity40 at any time of the day and night			1
in this particular scene , @entity40 wants @entity32 flayed alive — and demands @entity15 does it			1
‘ when @entity15 describes the beating of @entity32 in his book , he feels that nowhere else in the world was there a darker moment happening , ’ @entity1 told me			1
we were talking in @entity49 on monday about the making of the film , which has received seven @entity53 nominations and is expected to haul in many more when @entity55 and @entity56 categories are revealed next month			1
‘ i remember i rode in with @entity57 that day			1
it was early and we had a conversation about it , ’ he said			1
during shooting , a stunt man monitored the whipping and marked an area that @entity1 and @entity27 could not cross			1
‘ it was very technical			1
if you stepped across the mark , you would be in the danger zone and @entity33 would have been lashed for real			1
dark : in one scene @entity1 's character is made by @entity28 , played by @entity27 , to beat one of his fellow slaves ‘ of course , we never got that close			1
we just did the best we could to recreate the dark moment			2
’ when @entity15 is abducted , @entity31 , too , was beaten — whacked with a wooden paddle until it splintered for real			1
‘ there was no way of avoiding that			2
you could n’t tell the story without showing what the psychological humiliation was , ’ he said			2
yet , strangely , in a way the film is a love story			2
the yearning and longing @entity15 has for his family is raw			1
‘ it ’s about how powerful the connection we have to our family and the ones we love , and how when that ’s disrupted it creates a whole other kind of fire , ’ @entity1 told me			1
drama : @entity1 's character @entity15 with his fellow slave @entity32 , played by @entity102 ‘ @entity15 does n’t want to survive — he wants to live			1
‘ it ’s that belief that he will see his loved ones again that helps him			2
it ’s also part of what puts him in danger of losing his mind			2
’ that the actor can convey such a complex set of emotions without going over the top marks his performance as the best of his career so far in the hottest picture of this year — and probably the next one , too			1
it opens here on january 10			2
rising star : @entity123 , the fast - rising @entity124 - born actress , will portray @entity126 writer and pacifist @entity127 in a film based on her seminal memoir a @entity130 @entity123 , the fast - rising @entity124 - born actress , will portray @entity126 writer and pacifist @entity127 in a film based on her seminal memoir @entity133			2
it is about the generation — including @entity127 ’s brother , fiancé and other close friends — who lost their lives during the @entity126			2
the movie — which is being produced by @entity142 and @entity143 — will go before cameras in the spring to be ready for a @entity146 release next year , which also marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the war			2
@entity127 ’s book also chronicles her own battles with her father over her determination to go to university , as her brother had			2
by 1915 , she felt compelled to do what she could to help the war effort , so @entity127 ( the mother of @entity159 politician @entity159 ) , joined the @entity160 to tend those who had been wounded at the front			2
but more than anything , it ’s a heart - breaking story of the once - gilded youth hurled into what war poet @entity167 called the ‘ scorching cautery ’ of war			0
by the time of the @entity172 in 1918 , @entity127 had lost her brother , @entity173 , her fiancé , @entity173 , and close family friends @entity174 and @entity176			0
@entity127 ’s memoir , published in 1933 , became an instant classic , but during @entity180 its pacifist sensibility was frowned upon			0
however , the @entity143 produced an acclaimed five - part drama which pushed the book onto the bestseller list			0
reading it again now , it makes you demand to know why our fighting men were sent to @entity187 and @entity188			0
ms @entity123 has just finished work on @entity191 ’s @entity190 and @entity194 ’s mad scientist drama @entity192			0
winner : @entity123 receives the @entity196 by an @entity198 award for ' @entity199 ' from @entity200 and @entity201 at the @entity202 after she completes @entity130 for director @entity203 ( his tv drama @entity204 with @entity205 and @entity206 is being shown on @entity207 on @entity208 ) , she will move onto the long - awaited movie @entity209 , with @entity210 ( who made the @entity212 movie ) as director			1
@entity214 will be her leading man in @entity209 , while @entity215 and @entity216 are being discussed for the other main male role , though it depends on dates as to which one will do it			1
talking of dates , it had been hoped that @entity223 , star of @entity224 , would portray @entity127			0
but she is due to start another movie , @entity226 , at the same time @entity130 will be shooting			0
refreshing : @entity228 plays a musician who is an anti-star in the new @entity232 movie @entity231 @entity228 ( right ) plays a musician who ’s an anti-star in the new @entity232 movie			0
‘ he ’s very working - class , he ’s happy doing his own thing , he does n’t want fame and he ’s not manicured or manufactured , ’ @entity56 said of the title role he plays in @entity231 , the luminous new movie by @entity238 and @entity232 , which opens here on january 24			0
that ’s probably one of the reasons i love the movie so much , because @entity231 disdains the very idea of marketing himself			0
he just wants to play his guitar , sing and get into trouble			0
‘ it ’s so refreshing , about someone who refuses to be socially and commercially manufactured , ’ @entity56 told me			0
the film is set in the @entity254 when there was a converging of traditional @entity258 music with the sounds coming out of the beat generation			1
anyone for @entity262 ? well , @entity231 , who has nowhere to live and is a shambles , is the @entity265			0
‘ he ’s a rebellious artist			0
he ’s a miserable f * * * , ’ @entity266 he ’s fascinating			0
i ’ve seen the film three times in six months and never tire of it			0
@entity273 is @entity274 , a singer married to a fellow performer played by @entity276 — but @entity231 has cuckolded @entity276 ’s character			1
at one point , @entity274 snarls at @entity279 : ‘ everything you touch turns to s * * *			0
you ’re like @entity284 ’s idiot brother ’			0
it ’s a put - down that sticks			0
during the first week of filming , all the cast waited for the @entity232 ’ approval after each take			0
‘ we ’re used to having our egos stroked , ’ @entity56 said			0
when it was n’t forthcoming , some thought they were going to be fired , but later realised the @entity293 do n’t waste precious time massaging egos			0
so , in case no one told him : @entity56 , your performance is sensational .			0
