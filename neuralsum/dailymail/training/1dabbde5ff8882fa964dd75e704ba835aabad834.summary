' i think i am the first @entity36 @entity35 man to do something like this			2
in my community it is a huge positive thing			2
' i am really proud of myself for doing this , i ca n't believe i have lived out a dream			2
and the most amazing thing i will take away from this is that the world is generally good and to be in an unfortunate situation is a rare thing			2
' @entity1 , 35 , left his hometown , @entity49 , in may last year and visited 33 countries including @entity51 ' on my journey around the world i experienced the most overwhelming hospitality , love and support			1
' i 've been asked if i was ever scared while i was on my own in remote places but it 's much scarier on a night out in @entity30			2
' when you are in such wonderful places , with stars overhead in the middle of nowhere with only the sounds of nature enveloping you , it is wonderful , so serene			0
' @entity1 first started cycling at 18 years old when he bought a second - hand bike that he used as his mode of transport			1
frightening moments : @entity1 pictured in @entity23 , where he survived a terrifying ordeal at gunpoint he said : ' it was n't until the bike was nicked three months later that i realised how much i loved cycling and how much i missed it			1
five days later i had got myself a better bike and i was off			0

' @entity1 set off from @entity113 on may 4 , 2013			1
he cycled an average of 100 miles each day , with his longest distance being 157 miles in one day			0

he said : ' i did n't cycle through @entity35 because my mum made me promise that i did n't go there			0
' going to @entity35 is okay but it is the bordering countries that are pretty lawless			2
' i did look into it but i considered that it was n't worth risking my life for , or breaking a mother 's promise			0
' in the end it worked out for the best because it meant instead the route took me through @entity134 , where i lived with workers and saw behind the glitz and glamour , and @entity17 , where i travelled in 53 degree heat but managed to fill up with icy cold water every 40 - or - so miles whenever i came across a mosque - these were fantastic places to travel through			0
' @entity168 : @entity1 's 15 - month adventure took him across @entity170 the most terrifying moment was when he was in @entity23 and was looking for somewhere to set up camp			1
he found an old derelict house and started to unpack when a man arrived with a gun to shoo him off			0
he ended up outside the house on his knees with his hands behind his head and a gun to his head			0
when the man realised he was harmless he let him go , but not before @entity1 said his prayers thinking he was going to die			1
in @entity133 he was robbed of $ 900 when two men pulled up in a car pretending to be cops and searched his bags			0
home : @entity1 cycled an average of 100 miles each day , with his longest distance being 157 miles in one day he said : ' but the upshot was that the robbery meant i ended up staying in a village i was n't originally going to stay in and ended up seeing such hospitality i could n't believe it			1
' my faith in humanity was destroyed and restored all in one day			0
' he said of his trip : " it was the most amazing time of my life , but all good things must come to an end			0
