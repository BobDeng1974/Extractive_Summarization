by @entity0 published : 05:22 est , 16 september 2013 updated : 09:39 est , 16 september 2013 when you 're next filling out your personal details on a form , spare a thought for this woman			0
with 35 letters and 19 syllables , @entity8 's name was so long , @entity12 authorities could n't print the whole thing on her driving licence or id card			1
instead , the 54 - year - old had to have a 34 - character , shortened version of her name - @entity20 - on the documentation and her first name removed entirely			2
ms @entity8 - whose maiden name was worth - had the shortened version of her name as @entity34 government computer systems only allowed 34 characters			1
the woman , who sometimes goes by the name " @entity38 " , said she began a campaign to have her full name printed after she was stopped in her car by police			2
she told @entity43 : ' the policeman looked at my licence and saw i had no first name			0
' i told him it is not my fault that my licence and state @entity15 are not correct and i am trying to get it corrected			0
' he then told me " well , you can always change your name back to your maiden name			0
" ' this hurt my heart			0
' ms @entity8 said that the officer 's attitude upset her because he was being ' disrespectful of the @entity12 people ' she said : ' over the last 22 years i have seen ... the culture of @entity34 being trampled upon and this policeman treated my name as if it was mumbo - jumbo			1
' victory : after 21 years , the 54 - year - old will have her 35 - letter surname on her licence as well as her first name after she brought her concerns to the governor 's department , they announced that a licence and an id card which allows her full name on it will be produced by the end of 2013			1
a spokeswoman for @entity34 's transport department , @entity82 , said computer systems across the state were being upgraded to accommodate longer names			1
she said : ' we have been made aware of that issue , and i know right now they are working to extend that limit to - i believe - 40 characters so that issue can be resolved ' marriage : @entity38 ' took the name of her late husband , pictured , in 1992 ms @entity8 - who got her name after marrying in 1992 - said that her name had many layers of meanings including ' one who would stand up and get people to focus in one direction when there was chaos and confusion , and help them emerge from disorder '			1
she said it can also mean ' when there is chaos and confusion , you are one that will stand up and get people to focus in one direction and come out of the chaos			2
' the woman said her husband , who died in 2008 , had similar issues with documentation			2
she said : ' he always had problems with trying to get people to use his whole name			0
' they would chop it up into smaller pieces			0

@entity8 , 54 , took her late husband 's 19 - syllable name in 1992
the name , which means ' one who would stand up and get people to focus ' , was one character too long for @entity12 government computers
after two - decade fight , the woman , whose maiden name was worth , will have her full name on all documentation by the end of the year
@entity34 's transport department said computer systems are being upgraded to accommodate longer names
