by @entity0 published : 17:54 est , 15 february 2014 @entity2 : 17:54 est , 15 february 2014 if you can remember dinner - party meals along the lines of curried lentil soup followed by bacon and onion hotpot , or if your early attempts at home decorating involved stenciling , rag - rolling and distressing every conceivable surface , then you will see the @entity14 ’s @entity13 , just off @entity15 in @entity17 ’s @entity16 , as a monument to your impecunious youth			1
for this is the home of @entity21 , author of 77 bestselling instructional tomes – including the @entity24 ’s @entity23 and the @entity25 – who died , aged 78 , last april			1
her son , the novelist @entity27 , leads me through shady passages to the kitchen , where much of her work was done			2
‘ this was her lair , ’ says @entity27 , 49 , pointing towards the @entity34 and the giant farmhouse table			2
‘ you ’d find her here at her typewriter – she never came to terms with a computer – struggling to meet some deadline , cooking a meal and welcoming all - comers at the same time			1
bold stroke : the @entity47 townhouse located in @entity17 's @entity16 has been painted brick red ‘ she was a truly creative person			1
when she did something – be it cooking , decorating or talking – she went at it with a fury			0
’ @entity21 ’s life story reads like the plot line for a novel			0
born in @entity56 , @entity57 , where her father was an executive for @entity59 , in the 1960s , she was the archetypal party girl			0
stunningly beautiful and a graduate of @entity62 , @entity63 , she was pursued by men including @entity65 , the cartoonist			0
she soon married film director @entity66 , with whom she had a daughter , the writer @entity68			1
then the plot gets murky			0
firstly , she had @entity27 as the result of an affair with the @entity73 writer @entity72 , who numbered @entity74 among his friends			1
then , as the swinging @entity76 rolled into the peace - and - love seventies , she went to live with struggling @entity79 novelist @entity78 in a bedsit in @entity81 , leaving @entity66 holding the children			1
unsurprisingly , the relationship with @entity78 did n’t last and , in 1979 , @entity21 moved to @entity17			1
around this time trendy young things were discovering rough - and - ready parts of the capital where sizeable properties – often warehouses or abandoned commercial buildings – could be bought for very little			1
illusions : many of the £ 2.3million home ¿ s features , from the stone walls to black and white floor tiles , were painted on by the late @entity21 cosy and central : the house is located in the trendy @entity99 area and has four bedrooms on three floors with her finger on the zeitgeist as usual , @entity21 found the @entity14 ’s @entity13 , near @entity104 , part of a brewing complex and the last word in derelict dumps			1
it was boarded up with corrugated iron , and she had to climb on to the roof to gain entry through an upstairs window			0
inside , she found rooms waist - deep in old tvs , mattresses , fridges and cookers			1
she bought it from the @entity119 for a song			0
by this time @entity21 had money coming through from her books and she was also working as the home editor of @entity124			2
so she set up camp on the top storey of the building and worked on the rest of it , room by room , as and when funds allowed			2
famous words : writer and interior designer @entity21 it was just after moving into the @entity14 ’s @entity13 that she also started a new relationship , with her next - door neighbour , the modernist architect sir @entity138			1
today the wreck that was the @entity14 ’s @entity13 has been quite exquisitely restored			0
the sitting room and study have a heavy @entity143 glow about them , and throughout the four - bedroom , three - storey house nothing is what it seems			1
touch the surfaces and the tiled walls of the hall are , in fact , hand - painted trompe l’oeil ; the marbled walls are similar pieces of fakery ; the black - and - white granite stone floors have been created with glossy chequer - board painting			2
there is a remarkable rounded landing where one wall panel opens , magically , into a secret passage leading to sir @entity138 ’s house next door			2
‘ my mother believed that you do n’t have to spend a fortune on fancy decorators to make a beautiful home , ’ says @entity27			2
the @entity14 ’s @entity13 is a showpiece of @entity21 ’s artistry			0
quite accidentally , for she was never motivated by money , it has also been an extremely profitable project – it ’s on the market for £ 2.3 million			1
the @entity15 area , with its bars , restaurants and markets , is now seriously ‘ hip ’			0
easy access to the @entity179 also adds to its value			0
‘ perhaps a wealthy banker will buy it : hopefully one with an interest in architecture , ’ says @entity27			0
‘ whoever it is , i just hope they do something funky with it			0
my mother would have liked that			0
’ @entity190 , 020 7236 8398			0
