@entity1 's earliest primates have taken a step up in the world , now that researchers have gotten a good look at their ankles			0
a new study has found that @entity8 , a small mammal that lived on a diet of fruit and insects , was a tree dweller			1
paleontologists made the discovery by analyzing 65 - million - year - old ankle bones collected from sites in northeastern @entity18			0
a new study has found that @entity8 , a small mammal that lived on a diet of fruit and insects , was a tree dweller			1
the identification of @entity8 ankle bones , found in the same area as the teeth , gave researchers a better sense of how it lived			1
' the ankle bones have diagnostic features for mobility that are only present in those of primates and their close relatives today , ' @entity31 said			0
' these unique features would have allowed an animal such as @entity8 to rotate and adjust its feet accordingly to grab branches while moving through trees			1
@entity8 , part of an extinct group of primates called plesiadapiforms , first appears in the fossil record shortly after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs			1
some researchers have speculated over the years that primitive plesiadapiforms were terrestrial , and that primates moved into the tree canopy later			2
these ideas can still be found in some textbooks today			0
' the textbook that i am currently using in my biological anthropology courses still has an illustration of @entity8 walking on the ground , ' said @entity31 of @entity60 , @entity61			1

' hopefully this study will change what students are learning about earliest primate evolution and will place @entity8 in the trees where it rightfully belongs , ' until now , paleontologists had only the animal 's teeth and jaws to examine , which left much of its appearance and behaviour a mystery			1

' these unique features would have allowed an animal such as @entity8 to rotate and adjust its feet accordingly to grab branches while moving through trees			1
' in contrast , ground - dwelling mammals lack these features and are better suited for propelling themselves forward in a more restricted , fore - and - aft motion			0
' the research provides the oldest fossil evidence to date that arboreality played a key role in primate evolution			0
previous images of @entity8 show it on the ground in essence , said the researchers , it implies that the divergence of primates from other mammals was not a dramatic event			1
rather , primates developed subtle changes that made for easier navigation and better access to food in the trees			0
' these new fossils support the idea that the first 10 million years of primate evolution happened in the context of an intense period of similar diversification in flowering plants , including the ability to climb in branches and collect fruits and other products of the trees at the very beginning , ' the team has said previously			2
@entity8 lived during the @entity132 , shortly after the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs			1
given the @entity136 , the new era began the mammal - dominated era , which we are still in			2
this mammal is generally believed to have been small and brown , and had a bushy tail			1
the tiny mammal is generally believed to have been brown and had a bushy tail			2
it weighed about 1.3 ounces , making it roughly the size of the smallest living primates : the mouse lemurs of @entity149			0
@entity150 had a lot of teeth , including relatively low - crowned molars , which were idea for eating fruit , although it probably ate other things as well			2
researchers believe it spent much of its time eating fruit and climbing trees			0
remains were originally discovered in what is now eastern @entity18 's @entity165 ( hence the animal 's name ) in deposits believed to be about 66 million years old			0
the researchers liken it to another early primate , @entity172 , for which more fossil material is available			0
based on that and the newly found bones , @entity8 weighed about 1.3 ounces , making it roughly the size of the smallest living primates : the mouse lemurs of @entity149			1
the mammal had a lot of teeth , including relatively low - crowned molars , which were specialized for eating fruit , although it probably ate other things too			2
tree living served this and other primates well , such that all but a few existing species remain at least partly arboreal			0
humans are part of the rare exceptions , since our more recent ancestors left the trees some 60 million years after @entity8 ' lifetime .			2

@entity8 was a small mammal that lived on a diet of fruit and insects
analysis of fossils reveal it was a tree dweller
