by @entity0 follow @ @ lauriewhitwell the man who led @entity2 to the @entity3 final four years ago has questioned why @entity4 has changed the team ’s formation so close to the tournament starting in @entity8			1
@entity9 said the decision to go from 4 - 3 - 3 to 5 - 3 - 2 left players little time to adapt to a ‘ significant transition ’ with their opening group game against @entity14 less than a fortnight away			1
@entity15 , who takes over at @entity16 once the @entity3 is over , implemented the new system , which relies on energetic wing - backs , in @entity2 ’s 1 - 0 friendly victory over @entity20 last saturday and will continue with it for the match against @entity22 tonight at the @entity23			1
video : scroll down to watch @entity4 taking @entity26 training tinkerman : @entity4 ( c ) has changed @entity2 's formation shortly before the start of the @entity3 the change was made to tighten up the @entity26 defence and has so far been seen as a success but @entity33 cautioned against such a large shift away from the style that brought him success in 2010			1
‘ it is his right to opt for a 5 - 3 - 2 system , but this is not my system , ’ @entity33 told @entity26 newspaper @entity38			1
‘ this is not just an adaptation , but a significant transition , which calls for a lot from players			2
last time round : @entity9 ( c ) took @entity2 to the final at the 2010 @entity3 - losing 1 - 0 to @entity14 ‘ as a coach i indicated as soon as possible how i wanted to play and then worked for two years			1
the players would grow accustomed			2
that needs to be faster			0
’ @entity15 has already given short shrift to doubts from others over his selection , which has @entity59 of @entity60 and @entity61 of @entity62 in the wing - back positions and @entity64 operating behind @entity65 and @entity66 in attack			2
and he is unlikely to care too much about @entity33 ’s observations			0
more relevant to the incoming @entity16 boss is where @entity2 finish and the ‘ large expectations ’ of the @entity26 federation			1
it is something he will undoubtedly have at @entity76 too			0
setting targets : the purpose is to win the @entity3 , insists next @entity16 manager @entity15 ‘ the purpose is to win the @entity3 – but that 's only for one , ’ said @entity15			1
‘ the purpose of the board is the semi-finals			0
that is maybe too big an expectation			0
‘ i think this team can beat all			0
but we can also lose			0
that ’s sport and we accept that but it ’s difficult for the @entity26 people to accept			2
‘ i give myself more pressure than anyone else			0

@entity4 will manage @entity2 at the @entity94 in @entity8
@entity26 manager has made a late change from 4 - 3 - 3 to 5 - 3 - 2
former coach @entity9 has questioned the *wisdom* of this
@entity2 lost 1 - 0 to @entity14 in the 2010 @entity3 final
