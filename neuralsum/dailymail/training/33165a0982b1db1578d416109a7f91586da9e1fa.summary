by @entity0 prince @entity2 is to become the global ‘ face ’ of the @entity6 as he shoulders more of the @entity4 ’s public duties , sources confirmed yesterday			1
the @entity2 – the longest heir apparent in @entity8 history – will take on his mother ’s physically - demanding and high - profile engagements such as foreign tours and investitures			1
it is the first acknowledgement that the @entity4 , who turns 88 in april , has made a conscious decision to allow her eldest son and other members of her family to take on more of her work			2
according to one senior palace source , her diary for the next 12 months is busier than her @entity30 year of 2012			2
they also dismissed claims that a planned trip to mark the 70th anniversary of the d - day landings in @entity36 in june will be the sovereign ’s final overseas engagement			2
the @entity39 has learnt that there are in fact plans for a second foreign visit later this year , although it is likely to be a short - haul trip			1
the movement of @entity2 to a more central role will allow the @entity4 to concentrate on her equally important ‘ backroom ’ role as head of state – including hosting foreign ambassadors and state visits , meetings with the prime minister and ploughing through the red boxes of official papers that need her attention every day			1
prince @entity58 's move from flying to a desk job has sparked speculation he is part of the family shift in responsibility it follows the most visible sign of change yet – the decision to merge the media relations teams for @entity69 and @entity70 and base a single operation at the @entity4 ’s @entity73 residence			1
it will be overseen by @entity2 ’s current head of communications , former @entity78 pr chief @entity77 – who will still be paid by the prince from his @entity81 income			2
an aide said it was an attempt to simply ‘ co-ordinate things better ’			2
government officials , meanwhile , have been making their own contingency plans for a change of sovereign – with the help of the @entity4 ’s private secretary sir @entity90			0
this month he was awarded a second knighthood by the government for a ‘ new approach ’ to the preparation for a new monarch			1
sources have indicated that sir @entity90 was ‘ put out ’ at the wording of the gong because it publicly acknowledges the @entity4 ’s death – seen as rather tactless in royal circles			0
but they admit that he has been helping the government ‘ put its ducks in a row ’			0
‘ when it comes to the issue of transition , there are certain things that the government needs to put in place , ’ said a source			0
@entity2 has already represented his mother at the bi-annual @entity118 heads of government meeting in @entity119 for the first time			1
and the @entity4 has also carried out a number of joint engagements with the @entity123 , who she once memorably referred to as ‘ that wicked woman ’			0
but a senior @entity69 aide told @entity39 : ‘ @entity4 is not shutting up shop			1
she is still the @entity4 and is still incredibly busy			0
it ’s the constant , daily work of being head of state that takes up so much of her time			0
’ the source acknowledged , however , that there would be a continuing ‘ change in pace ’ – and added about the forthcoming visit to @entity36 this summer : ‘ it is not her swansong			0
‘ her private office have openly confirmed she is pulling back on long haul travel , but do n’t forget that the @entity139 went to @entity140 last year at the age of 92			0

longest heir apparent will take on foreign tours and investitures
also meeting with prime minister and working through red box documents
@entity69 *insists* monarch is far from retiring and works behind the scenes
