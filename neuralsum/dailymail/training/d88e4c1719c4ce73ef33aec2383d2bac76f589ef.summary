by @entity2 , @entity1 correspondent created 5:31 pm on 23rd september 2011 @entity4 @entity3 outside the @entity6 hearing in @entity7 a @entity4 doctor spoke of his disgust last night after he claimed he was being put on trial for discussing his faith with a patient			1
dr @entity3 vented his fury at the @entity6 for persisting with a misconduct tribunal even though the patient involved refused to turn up to give evidence			1
the 24 - year - old man was un-named and the @entity6 even kept details of his faith secret , on the grounds of ‘ patient confidentiality ’			1
speaking after the case was adjourned , dr @entity3 , a 51 - year - old gp , said : ‘ i ’m actually not only disappointed , i ’m disgusted with my professional body			2
when i started in medicine , you were led to believe the @entity6 were there to serve both patients and doctors			2
that is not the case			2
i think there is an anti-christian bias with the @entity6			2
’ the @entity3 case is the latest in a series of incidents in which hospitals and medical authorities have been perceived as acting to suppress any expression of @entity4 beliefs			1
one case , that of a nurse ordered off the wards because she refused to take off her crucifix , is shortly to be heard at the @entity46			0
dr @entity3 spoke to the 24 - year - old patient , described as suicidal and vulnerable , at the end of a consultation at the @entity50 in @entity51 in august last year			1
the practice declares its @entity4 orientation and informs prospective patients that they may be offered spiritual guidance as well as medical help			1
the gp is said to have suggested to the patient that they might discuss religion			2
the patient is believed to have replied ‘ go for it ’ and dr @entity3 told him about the ‘ additional help which he might derive from @entity63 ’ and added that he might feel better if he prayed , as the patient ’s own religion did not appear to be giving him comfort			1
religious practice : dr @entity3 with his wife @entity68 outside the hearing the patient , who was seen by the @entity4 at the @entity50 ( pictured ) in @entity51 , felt dr @entity3 had ' belittled ' his own faith the patient ’s mother , who had recommended dr @entity3 to her son , complained ‘ weeks later ’			1
the patient himself did not complain until three months after the consultation , when he said he had been ‘ very upset ’ and his own faith had been belittled			1
the patient did not appear at yesterday ’s hearing			2
he has informed the @entity6 it would be a ‘ big inconvenience ’ and he would not attend ‘ for a million pounds ’			0
the misconduct charge could end in a warning to dr @entity3 from the @entity83			0
it could also lead to an instruction to the @entity4 to appear before a future fitness to practice hearing , which in turn could strip him of his right to work as a doctor			1
during the hearing , lawyers for the professional body said the gp had ‘ crossed the line ’ when he discussed his own faith with a patient			1
outside , dr @entity3 said the misconduct hearing amounted to religious persecution			0
he added : ‘ i think within medicine a lot is science based , so secular beliefs have a very strong voice			0
other @entity104 in medicine and nursing have increasingly been under attack			0
’ dr @entity3 said he had been angered at the complaint of the patient ’s mother that he had not done anything medical in the consultation			2
‘ that was shown to be a fabrication , they should have thrown it out , ’ he said			0
‘ at the end of it , he did n’t like what i was saying , he called me an idiot , which is his right , and asked me to stop			0
he knew this is a @entity4 surgery			1
’ @entity122 of the @entity123 , which is supporting dr @entity3 , said : ‘ we think every gp should be concerned by the way their professional body has acted			0
first of all they pursued dr @entity3 for 14 months , then they arrived at court without the principal witness thinking they could prove their case on hearsay			0
’ @entity132 , for the @entity6 , said : ‘ there is no possible question of an abusive process			0
the reason why attempts were not made to obtain @entity138 was because no request was made until last friday by those who represent dr @entity3 , which was well out of the notice period			0
’ the hearing was adjourned until the witness can appear .			0

@entity4 is alleged to have told a patient faith in @entity147 may help him *overcome* *personal* *problems*
