a brick tycoon is suing a top qc who pulled out of buying his £ 3.6million country manor after claiming it was riddled with damp and dry rot			1
leading barrister @entity1 and his wife @entity5 thought they had found their dream home when they viewed @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 in 2010			1
the 30 - room mansion is set in 12 acres of countryside and its architecture has been compared to that of @entity18 @entity17 's much - loved summer home , @entity19 on the @entity20			2
@entity1 and his wife @entity5 , left , who are being sued by @entity21 after they pulled out of buying @entity9 in @entity11 @entity9 , in @entity11 , which @entity23 and mrs @entity24 had originally agreed to buy for £ 3.6million , before pulling out saying it was ' riddled with damp and dry rot ' mr @entity26 , 66 , a planning and property lawyer and a committee member of the @entity29 agreed to exchange contracts on the property with then owners @entity21 and his wife @entity33 in april 2011			1
however the @entity34 and his wife did not see a surveyor 's report on the mansion until after the contracts has been exchanged			1
after receiving the survey in may 2012 , @entity23 and mrs @entity24 ' rescinded ' the contract and refused to complete the purchase			0
they insisted they had been the victims of ' reckless misrepresentation ' by the then owners			2
the main reception room at @entity9 , which is at the centre of a court battle between @entity1 and brick tycoon @entity21 mr and mrs @entity24 claim that a survey revealed the 150 - year - old property was badly affected by rising damp and wet and dry rot			1
pictured is the dining room they claimed that , rather than being the ' pristine ' dream home they expected , the survey revealed that the 150 - year - old @entity58 manor was badly affected by ' rising damp and wet and dry rot ' , which would cost up to £ 600,000 to remedy			2
mr @entity21 , who flies a helicopter , and his wife are now suing @entity23 and mrs @entity24 at @entity62 's @entity61 for a six - figure sum over their refusal to go through with the sale , alleging breach of contract			1
@entity69 , for @entity23 and mrs @entity70 , told judge @entity71 , that @entity9 is a magnificent property , built in 1853 , with 30 rooms on four storeys			1
it has an @entity76 similar to that of @entity19 , and boasts a helicopter pad , gym , cinema and staff quarters			0
it was on the market for £ 4.5million and @entity23 and mrs @entity24 had agreed to buy it for £ 3.6million , before reading the surveyor 's report			1
the master bedroom in the £ 3.6million country manor , which was once owned by sir @entity90 , a close friend of @entity17 the spacious kitchen of @entity9 , left			1
the floor as you enter the building , right , still has the crest of sir @entity96 in tiles mr @entity98 told the judge that the contract contained a ' common ' clause used in conveyancing , whereby the @entity34 and his wife promised to accept and pay for the property based on its state of repair at the time of signing			1
he added that having agreed to the contract , with the clause in place , the couple were legally bound to go ahead with the purchase , and must now pay damages for failing to do so			1
mr @entity98 said : ' merely describing the size of the property and the age of the property , it was obvious that there was always going to be some damp in this property somewhere			1
' the question is how obvious that would have been to a lay person			0
' the vendor is obliged to inform the purchaser of latent structural defects of which he is aware , ( but ) the buyer accepts the physical condition of the property at the date of the contract			0
' the purchasers were entitled to opt in or out of the conditions as they chose			0
in this case the contract is binding			0
the house was on the market for £ 4.5million and @entity23 and mrs @entity24 had agreed to buy it for £ 3.6million before reading a surveyor 's report ' these clauses are very common			1
the vendor is a lay person in matters of law ... the purchaser is an eminent @entity34 with property expertise			0
' there is no suggestion that the vendor had to sell or the purchaser had to buy			0
' the property was accepted in the physical state it was in at the time of contract and you ca n't go back on that now			0
' if it is damp , it is accepted with damp			0
it can not be rejected post-exchange on grounds like this , ' he concluded			0
the manor also boasts a helicopter pad , pictured as well as gym , cinema and staff quarters but @entity172 , for @entity23 and mrs @entity24 , disputed the meaning of the controversial clause in the contract , and accused the sellers of ' reckless misrepresentation ' in relation to the state of the house before contracts were exchanged			1
he said : ' it was assumed by @entity23 and mrs @entity24 that they were buying a pristine property			0
@entity9 was originally built between 1760 and 1780 although it is unknown how much of the original building remains			2
it was bought by sir @entity96 , a lord mayor and @entity188 in the 1840s			0
he was a close friend of @entity17 and @entity190 and admired their summer residence of @entity19 , which also has a similar @entity194 style tower to @entity9			2
the @entity196 's family lived in the property for more than 70 years and it was sold in 1911 to a private buyer			2
in 1930 it was bought by the @entity200 , who used it as an office until the 1990s			0
it was then bought over and restored to its former glory by a private owner			0
' they did n't want to have to spend a lot of money on the inside of the house , ( but ) our survey suggests a reduction of £ 600,000 to take account of the problems with the property			2
' part of the misrepresentations was that they had fully refurbished the house and that it did n't suffer from damp or rot			0
' the barrister added : ' the place had substantial rising damp and wet and dry rot			0
the property has been materially misrepresented to them in light of the surveyor 's report			1
' mr @entity172 said that the report indicated there was ' extensive rising damp , dry rot and timber decay which may affect the structural integrity of the house , ' mainly focused in the lower ground floor of the building			2
mr and mrs @entity24 had also objected to the sale of a plot of land adjacent to the property to another buyer , the court heard			1
@entity247 mr @entity26 attended @entity248 , before graduating from @entity249			0
he was called to the bar in 1974 and made a silk in 1993			0
his areas of expertise include planning and property law , and he has been called ' one of the sharpest barristers in the land ' by @entity258			0
a surveyor 's report indicated that there was ' extensive rising damp , dry rot and timber decay ' which may affect the structure of the house he also plays a leading role in the @entity29 and was a trustee of the @entity267			1
mr @entity98 said outside court that @entity9 has now been sold to another purchaser for the same £ 3.6m price			1
mr @entity21 now lives in @entity10 with his wife , manages a church , and has business interests valued at £ 17m			1
the @entity61 hearing continues .			2

@entity1 and wife @entity5 exchanged contracts on @entity9
agreed to buy the property from brick tycoon @entity21 for £ 3.6million
couple did not see a surveyor 's report until after exchanging the contracts
then tried to rescind the agreement claiming ' reckless *misinterpretation* '
mr @entity21 is now suing them at the @entity61 for pulling out of the sale
