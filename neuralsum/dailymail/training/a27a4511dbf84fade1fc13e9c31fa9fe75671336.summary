by @entity0 she was a promising film - maker on the verge of a stellar career			1
but rather than pursuing her @entity6 dream , @entity4 chose to turn her back on the big time for a life on conservation 's front line			1
outraged by figures that revealed @entity14 's carnivore population had halved during the 1980s , she and her siblings launched @entity15 - a pioneering organisation that has saved more than 1,000 lions , leopards and cheetahs since 1993			1
but , says the veteran conservationist , while numbers are picking up , the animals are still under threat - both from poachers and from farmers who shoot the animals as they move across their land for fear of what might happen to their cows if they do n't			1
' they 're so essential for keeping the balance and they mostly take out the weak and the old , so that the strong are left to breed			0
' as in other @entity64 countries , @entity14 's big cats are coming under increasing pressure from human farmers and , although not to the same extent as rhinos and elephants , are also threatened by poaching			1
currently , the country is home to an estimated 6,000 cheetahs , 4,000 leopards and around 600 lions , while the number of @entity76 - a species particularly loathed because of their vicious habit of ripping chunks of flesh out of living animals - is unknown but thought to be low			1
most of those rescued by the @entity86 are the victims of traps and snares ; some of which leave the animal so injured , it can never be released back into the wild			1
for the lucky ones , rescue means being given a new life in @entity96 , a stretch of wilderness in northern @entity14 that covers 8,600sqm chunk of savannah and salt pan			2
new life : for the luckier animals rescued by @entity4 and her team , a new life at the gorgeous @entity96 in northern @entity14 beckons healthy : big cats , such as those relocated to @entity96 by @entity4 and her team , help keep the springbok population in check and ensure only the strong breed safe : @entity96 , one of the world 's largest reserves , has been a haven for wildlife since 1907 , when it was established by the @entity118 colonial authorities the @entity86 is partially funded by guests staying at @entity120			1
@entity121 and @entity122 , which offers a 12 - day tour that includes a night at the lodge and a chance to meet the animals at the reserve			2
packages include accommodation , meals and transfers , with prices starting at £ 1,874 per person			0
for more information , see @entity135 @entity137 offers return flights to @entity139 from @entity140 via @entity141 from £ 1,010			0
for further information on @entity14 , please visit namibiatourism.com.na for more on @entity86 , see @entity143 those who ca n't be released go instead to the @entity145 , a small stretch of land nestled among the @entity148 , which along with a small lodge , houses the @entity86 itself			1
from @entity150 , @entity4 and her colleagues run a programme that encompasses the whole of @entity14 and combines rescuing trapped wildlife with educating farmers and schoolchildren - much of it paid for using the proceeds of the on - site safari lodge			1
' the secret to conservation is habitat , ' explains @entity4			1
' if you 've got the space , animals make it , they survive			2
but we 're also dealing with farmers that have to survive			0
' they have to farm with leopards , cheetahs , elephants , spotted hyenas and brown hyenas and wild dogs whereas a farmer in @entity178 might at the most have to deal with a wolf of a bear			1
or if they 're in the @entity182 , a fox			0
' what we do is say to the farmer , " take a week to come in @entity150 and we will show you how to keep the cattle safe without using traps or shooting the wildlife "			0
we 're trying to change their minds and methods - that 's conservation			0
' but while many have embraced the reforms championed by @entity4 and her team , others continue to take a harsher stance on dealing with wildlife - much to @entity4 's distress			2
' the ugliest thing is the cruelty and the greed , ' she says , sadly			0
' to destroy nature as much as you can just for the benefit of your own pocket - just so you can make as much money as you can			0
' but that 's not all			0
' cruelty is often a combination of ignorance and fear , ' she continues			0
' so people do horrible things to animals because they fear them , or because they do n't realise , or ignore , the fact that animals get stressed			2
' i 've seen farmers keeping cheetahs in tiny cages in the baking , 50 ° c summer heat just to punish it for killing his calf			2
and then there 's a new type of poaching , where people kill mothers just to take the babies and raise them like they saved them			1
then , when they grow up , they sell them to hunting farms to be shot for money			1
' under threat : @entity76 are increasingly endangered thanks to farmers who loathe them for their cruel method of killing their prey tracking : a team from @entity150 hunt for one of the cheetahs living onto the property			2
all are given electronic tags before being released relaxed : one of the tagged cheetahs at @entity150 relaxes in a patch of long grass after tucking into a springbok supper getting angry , she adds : ' it should be classified alongside human trafficking and illegal arms trafficking			0
poaching needs to be attacked by a government level			0
we ca n't fight that battle			0
farmers earn so much money passing on trapped animals to the poachers , it 's impossible for us to fight			1
' and it 's not just the big cats that suffer appalling cruelty			1
whipping out a sheaf of photos , @entity4 runs through some of the other horrors she and her team have come across			2
one shows a baby pangolin being turned into soup ( ' a cultural problem ' says @entity4 ) , a truly ghastly image of a pair of horses being worked into exhaustion by two children and kicked when they fall over , an elephant lying bloated and tusk-less after being mutilated by poachers and a snap of two adult lions dead and bloody in a trap			1
clearly , there is much for @entity4 and her team to do			2
for all that , she remains hopeful about the future and says she hopes that one day , people will give @entity64 's wildlife the respect and protection it deserves			0
' in all the years that we 've been doing this , we 've managed to talk to around five per cent of farmers			0
if we have managed to change the minds of just that five per cent , then we 're already happy			0
' but hopefully , with the rise of the internet , more people will find out about what 's going on and fewer animals will be shot			2
hopefully the next generation of farmers will realise that killing is n't fun and that it certainly is n't a solution to their problems			0
' education : one part of @entity4 's job involves teaching local children and farmers to appreciate the big cats with whom they share their lives long road : although @entity4 and @entity15 have enjoyed some spectacular successes , she says there is still a very long way to go tiny : jackals are also helped by @entity15 but suffer less at the hands of farmers , who do n't see them as a huge threat to their livestock wonderful : one of the leopards living on @entity15 's @entity150 property blinks sleepily in the sunshine on the prowl : a rescued cheetah goes about its business at the @entity43 in @entity14 lights out : a dramatic red and black sunset over @entity15 's @entity150 reserve			1
the property is a three - hour drive from @entity139			0

@entity4 was on the verge of a @entity6 career but *decided* to become a conservationist instead
one of the founders of the @entity86 , which began life in 1993 and has saved more than 1,000 big cats
says the animals are threatened by poachers who kill the mothers and sell the cubs to hunting farms to be shot
more are at risk from farmers who fear for the lives of their animals if leopards , lions and cheetahs are around
