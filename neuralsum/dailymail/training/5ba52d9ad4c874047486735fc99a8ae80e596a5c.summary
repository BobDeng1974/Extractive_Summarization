the parents of a four - year - old girl who is allergic to school dinners say she is being forced to eat her packed lunch in an ' isolation room '			1
the head teacher of @entity6 in @entity7 , north west @entity8 , allegedly told @entity10 's parents it was ' anti-social ' to eat her allergen - free meal around other pupils			1
free hot meals are compulsory for younger years , and @entity10 's parents are now embroiled in a row with the school over the bizarre situation - which they have branded ridiculous			1
they claim she has been made to eat in isolation to avoid being ' anti-social ' her mother @entity24 , a 36 - year - old dance instructor , said : ' i could n’t believe my ears			2
why on @entity32 is it anti-social for my daughter to eat different food ? ' we have a legitimate reason to not want her to eat school dinners			1
her intolerances and allergies are still unclear , but we know which foods to keep her away from			2
' i do n’t think there ’s anything wrong with school dinners there as a whole , but they are wrong for my daughter			2
' ms @entity24 and @entity10 's father @entity21 , a plumber , say they are still going through the process of full allergy - testing for their daughter , whose problems began aged one			1
that means they do not know the full extent of her allergies or what could be causing them			0
however , they say she reacts the worst to sugar , dairy and artificial additives such as monosodium glutamate			0
mr @entity21 said : ' our eight - year - old son @entity70 goes to @entity72 and he eats school lunches			2
row : the parents are in a dispute with @entity6 in @entity7 , north west @entity8 ' it ’s not the composition of the meals we have a problem with - it ’s the mandatory nature of the school ’s policy			1
' if @entity10 eats something that disagrees with her , she ends up with a horrific , hacking cough for as long as a week			1
children can develop one of hundreds of food allergies including milk , eggs , wheat , nuts , seeds and shellfish - with reactions ranging from a skin rash to vomiting and anaphylaptic shock			0
allergies to food additives such as e-numbers are relatively uncommon compared to those to milk and nuts			0
nut allergies are among the most common , afflicting up to one in 50 children according to the @entity106			0
despite many outlets offering allergy tests , the charity @entity107 claims this is not the best way to find out which foods are causing the problem			2
the organisation says the ' gold standard ' is to draw up strict diets and stick to them while keeping a detailed diary of symptoms			0
' the cough sounds very painful too - why ever would we want to put our daughter through that ? ' now they ’re effectively giving her a lunchtime detention , punishment for eating something different			0
' the couple say head teacher @entity131 spoke to them on the first day of term last month and insisted @entity10 would have to eat school meals because it was ' anti-social ' to have different food			1
after weeks of rowing , the family say they came to a tentative agreement where @entity10 eats in a separate room accompanied by one other pupil and the school nurse			1
mr @entity21 : ' we allowed her to have just one ice - cream from the van this summer , because she said she wanted to be like all her friends			0
' for a week afterwards she was up all night coughing , and her eczema flared up			0
' the school provides free lunches to all children in the first three years as part of a flagship scheme by @entity156 , who said it would help improve concentration and raise learning standards			2
pupils in other years have the option of either eating school dinners or bringing in their own packed lunch , as long as it conforms to school health guidelines			1
the school introduced free hot meals for the youngest three years thanks to a policy by @entity156 ( pictured ) ms @entity24 added : ' our son chooses whether he wants dinner or a packed lunch , and every time we make it for him , we have to conform to a series of very sensible nutritional guidelines			1
' the school has banned chocolate , crisps and fizzy drinks , for example , which i think is absolutely fair enough			0
' @entity6 's head teacher declined to comment on the parents ' claims earlier today			1
mr @entity21 said : ' we are not food hippy parents , forcing our kids to only eat a vegan , whole food diet			0
we want to choose what our food - intolerant daughter eats , because she ’s too young to control it herself			0
' we have a legitimate reason - we ’re not just being contrary for the sake of it			0

@entity10 has rashes and cough when she eats certain foods
she took packed lunch to @entity203 in @entity7 , north @entity8
@entity205 erupted between parents and school , where free hot meals compulsory
