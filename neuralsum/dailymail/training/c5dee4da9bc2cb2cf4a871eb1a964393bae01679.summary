@entity0 says both @entity1 and @entity2 should dump the euro and quit the @entity4 because of their massive debts @entity1 and @entity2 should quit the euro to help save the currency , @entity0 said yesterday			2
the former currency speculator turned billionaire philanthropist also backed the idea of a euro bond , where debt is issued jointly by member states			2
he said : ‘ countries sharing the currency must be able to refinance a large part of their debt under the same conditions			2
’ such a bond would allow @entity21 ’s poorer countries to raise money cheaply , because @entity24 and @entity25 financial muscle would act as a guarantee			1
@entity0 told @entity25 's @entity28 magazine that @entity2 and @entity1 leaving would not kill off the euro - or the @entity4			1
debt - stricken @entity1 and @entity2 are struggling to implement eurozone and @entity32 - mandated reforms by slashing spending and raising taxes in exchange for financial aid			2
@entity21 shares experienced slight gains as investors focused on tomorrow ’s meeting between @entity24 and @entity25 to deal with the current financial crisis in the region			1
president @entity43 and chancellor @entity44 have taken leading roles in the debt crisis and will hold talks and a press conference in @entity49			2
@entity0 also suggested the time had come for eurozone members to accept the introduction of eurobonds			2
' whether you like it or not , the euro exists			2
and for it to function properly , countries sharing the currency must be able to refinance a large part of their debt under the same conditions , ' he said			2
@entity65 is opposed to the introduction of such bonds , but @entity0 suggested @entity25 , as @entity21 's strongest financial partner , should be responsible for defining the rules for its introduction			1
@entity0 , who made over $ 1billion by betting against the @entity73 pound in 1992 , also said he had no intention of playing the market against the common european currency			0
' i am certainly not betting against the euro , because the @entity79 have a huge interest in an alternative to the dollar and will do everything possible to help @entity21 save it , ' he said			0
chancellor @entity44 and president @entity43 ( pictured here in december last year ) have taken leading roles in the debt crisis and will hold talks and a press conference in @entity49			0
both @entity1 and @entity2 , along with @entity89 , have been granted multi-billion @entity4 - @entity32 rescue loans to prevent them from defaulting on their huge debts			0
despite @entity65 ’s resistance to the idea of eurobonds , today one of @entity25 ’s leading economic associations came out in favour of the move , claiming all other avenues had been exhausted			1
@entity103 export association president @entity101 said : ‘ what is the alternative ? ' the alternative is the markets attack @entity107 , then @entity24 , we lose our aaa rating and then it 's our turn			1
this is a downward spiral that would lead to a worldwide depression			0
' what have we achieved then ? we 'll end up paying [ for the crisis ] three times over			0
this way we pay just once			0
' the head of the centre - left @entity119 , @entity118 , has also backed the idea , telling @entity25 public television station @entity123 late on sunday that eurozone countries should be able to raise 50 - 60 per cent of their funding through such joint issues if they agreed to certain conditions			1
@entity43 ( left ) was pictured this weekend at a lunch with crew members of the @entity24 aircraft carrier @entity133 during a visit aboard the ship in @entity136			1
@entity44 , right , attended a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the construction of the @entity140 ' states that use eurobonds would have to agree to give up a degree of sovereignty over their own budgets , ' @entity118 said			0
after unveiling tougher austerity plans in return for @entity151 help , @entity107 economy minister @entity147 said a common eurozone bond would stop markets forcing high - debt economies in the bloc to the brink			1
' we would not have arrived where we are if we had had the eurobond , ' he said on saturday			0
@entity44 and @entity43 are instead expected to discuss improving economic governance in the eurozone			0
officials have suggested they could agree to introduce regular meetings of eurozone leaders - a longstanding @entity24 demand - and enlarge the role of @entity168 president @entity167 to make him a spokesman for the euro			1
these steps could bring greater policy discipline in the 17 - nation currency bloc , which has regularly sowed confusion in the markets by talking with disparate voices , but are unlikely to assuage market concerns about the high debt and deficit levels of certain countries in the bloc			1
yields on @entity107 and @entity184 bonds fell back to around five percent last week after the @entity151 intervened in the market to support them			0

both @entity25 finance minister @entity190 and economy minister @entity191 gave interviews over the weekend in which they spoke out against eurozone bonds and debt collectivization			1
conservative @entity25 newspaper @entity197 , however , reported that the government was no longer ruling out the idea			1
@entity44 , whose popularity has sunk to its lowest level in nearly five years according to recent polls , could face a revolt within her coalition and @entity25 's broader economic policy establishment if she agreed to joint bond issuance			1
her coalition partners , the @entity208 ( @entity209 ) and the @entity210 ( @entity211 ) , are seen as dead - set against the idea			0
the leadership of the @entity209 have set a meeting for wednesday to discuss their stance on the euro crisis , which will be chaired by @entity191 , a party spokesman said			0
@entity25 media reports have said a working group within @entity44 's own @entity221 ( @entity220 ) has been studying the idea of eurobonds in greater detail , suggesting some may be open to it			1
but leading members of the party have ruled it out in clear terms in recent weeks and other northern @entity21 member states , such as the @entity231 and @entity232 are also vehemently opposed			0
@entity101 of the @entity103 said , however , that eurobonds may be the only solution that can prevent the markets from launching new assaults on eurozone members			2
' we must show the markets that we are ready to use the appropriate tools , and that means eurobonds signed off by @entity25 , ' said @entity101			1
' we need eurobonds with strict conditions attached			0
we need this and we need it fast			0
