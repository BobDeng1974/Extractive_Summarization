@entity0 ( @entity1 ) 2			1
@entity2 ( @entity3 ) 3			2
@entity4 ( @entity1 ) 4			2
@entity5 ( @entity6 ) 5			0
@entity7 ( @entity8 ) there were three winners at the end of a @entity13 @entity12 that sparkled as brightly as the @entity16 - advert smile of the man standing on the top step of the podium : @entity0			1
another victor was @entity2 , who extended his championship lead to 22 points over his unfortunate @entity3 team - mate @entity23 , who retired with mechanical failure when vying for the lead of the race			1
the final triumph was for @entity28 itself			0
the @entity31 circuit , as it so often does , delivered an abundance of drama on the sun - kissed tarmac next to the @entity37 rowing lake			0
jubilation : @entity0 celebrates after winning the @entity13 @entity12 winning moment : the @entity40 comes home to take the chequered flag in @entity43 delight : @entity0 overtook @entity2 with two laps left of an eventful race in @entity43 1			1
@entity2 ( @entity3 ) - 140 2			1
@entity23 ( @entity3 ) - 118 3			1
@entity0 ( @entity1 ) - 79 4			1
@entity47 ( @entity48 ) - 69 5			0
@entity4 ( @entity1 ) - 60 but we should return to congratulate @entity0 , who had a podium finish in his home race in @entity52 in march taken from him because his team broke fuel flow regulations			1
on sunday , told over the radio that he had won , he simply said : ‘ wow			0
’ half - collecting his thoughts during the ceremony he said : ‘ i ’m still in shock			0
it is a bit surreal			0
it ’s not that we were leading the race from start to finish			2
the dramatic start set the tone			0
@entity2 , beginning on pole , was not away as quickly as @entity23			1
but the @entity69 had the positional advantage to hold his team - mate off at the first , tight left - hander			1
@entity23 lost second place to @entity1 ’s @entity4 , who ended up third			1
race over ? not a bit of it			0
more drama ensued just moments later involving @entity78			0
what a difference a fortnight made for them			0
in @entity83 they celebrated their first point in a four - and - a - half year history through @entity87 ’s ninth place			0
but neither of their cars made the end of the first lap here , as @entity87 and @entity93 collided , leaving a smear of oil on the track that brought out the safety car for six laps			2
the accident ended the world ’s least spectacular record : @entity93 ’s streak of 25 unbroken finishes stretching back to his debut in @entity52 last season			0
hugs all round : @entity0 is congratulate by team - mate @entity4 arms aloft : an ecstatic @entity0 on the podium at the @entity109 silverware : @entity0 lifts the winners ' trophy after his victory at the @entity13 @entity12 soon @entity113 had passed @entity4 using the @entity115 boost			1
at this stage both @entity3 were struggling slightly on their supersoft tyres but still lapped quicker than everybody else by dint of their superior engines			0
after 18 laps , @entity2 came in			2
it was a smooth stop of 3.1sec			0
he was followed by @entity23 , delayed half a second longer in the pit box			2
@entity2 rode the kerbs high at the first chicane and nearly wobbled off			2
@entity23 pulled closer and closer to @entity2 ’s exhaust over the following minutes , turning the timing screens purple , the colour that denotes fastest sectors and laps			1
@entity2 could see @entity23 getting bigger in his mirrors and , under pressure , missed the apex of turn 14 , cutting the corner			1
the stewards issued a final warning			0
shower time : second - placed @entity2 sprays champagne over the winner @entity0 collision : @entity144 driver @entity143 crashed out on the final lap of an eventful race unscathed : the @entity147 escaped from his collision and walked out of his abandoned car damage : the remains of @entity143 's @entity144 is dragged away from the circuit by a recovery vehicle problems : both @entity3 drivers reported a lack of power midway through the race it was probably the right decision on balance : @entity2 had gained time but not a place			1
it would have been harsh to order the @entity69 to cede the position			0
@entity23 , who harried @entity2 for much of the race , started to fall away around the middle of the 70 laps , before he complained over the radio : ‘ i am losing power guys			1
’ we then learned that @entity2 was suffering the same affliction			2
@entity173 , the @entity3 chairman in his trademark red cap , wore a worried look in the team ’s paddock home			0
a ship ’s horn sounded — like a warning in the @entity183 on which this island track stands — and well it might			0
the trauma had barely started for the @entity186 , who instructed both their drivers to reset their systems			0
@entity2 was told : ‘ we do n’t think we can resolve it			2
you need to pick up the pace			0
@entity193 ( the third – placed car ) is catching us now			0
’ bold : @entity23 tried to jump @entity2 into the first corner but went in too deep squeezed off : @entity23 ended up falling behind @entity1 's @entity4 on the first lap all gone wrong : @entity23 was forced to retire with over 20 laps of the race remaining the two @entity3 came in for their second stops			1
@entity2 ’s stop was slower than that of @entity23 , who came out in the lead			1
it was short - lived as @entity2 passed him			1
@entity23 fought back but missed the apex at the same spot as @entity2 had and had to let his rival back through			1
@entity23 , smoke coming from his car , slowed down and finally retired with rear break failure , having completed 45 laps			1
@entity2 inexplicably ran over the grass and , still struggling for power and therefore speed , was now in a different race — with those behind him			1
could he hang on ? no. with two laps remaining , @entity0 wrestled his way past the @entity3 of @entity2			1
‘ @entity0 is an amazing young man , ’ said @entity1 designer @entity219			2
‘ what impresses me most is how calming he is when he comes on the team radio			0
we were a bit lucky today in truth but we were there and ready			0
’ end of the road : @entity23 is wheeled back into his garage after being forced to retire lonely walk : @entity231 's @entity230 driver @entity229 walks away after being forced to retire correct			1
@entity2 , who had problems with the energy recovery system and consequently with overheating brakes , said afterwards : ‘ we need to be bullet - proof			2
’ nevertheless , he could take many positives from the weekend , not least beating @entity23 to pole on saturday			0
the final twist came in the closing moments when @entity143 ran his @entity144 into the back of @entity241 , who had driven so brilliantly for @entity8 for so much of the afternoon that he was lying fourth at the time			1
it looked bad , but neither driver was seriously hurt			0
the safety car came out , bringing an inappropriately stately , slow end to a rip - roaring race .			2

@entity0 overtook @entity2 in closing stages in @entity43
@entity2 and @entity23 suffer with lack of power after leading race
@entity256 driver forced to retire *due* to a brake failure
@entity2 finished second with @entity4 third
@entity143 crashed out on final lap at end of eventful race
@entity2 now leads team - mate @entity23 by 22 points in standings
