by @entity1 reporter last updated at 4:33 pm on 14th february 2012 @entity2 and the @entity3 have joined forces to demand the @entity5 take further action in @entity7 , as president @entity9 's brutal military crackdown shows no sign of stopping			1
prime minister @entity11 and @entity3 president @entity12 agreed in a telephone call last night on the ' need for international unity ' - as the city of @entity17 was bombarded by rockets and mortars for a eleventh consecutive day			1
today 's attacks saw @entity9 's troops attacking rebels and homes on several fronts , with @entity17 succumbing to severe food and fuel shortages as residents remain trapped inside their homes			1
the need , @entity11 's spokesman said , included : ' further action at the @entity5 and a broad and strong coalition in the new @entity33			2
' warzone : @entity7 army tanks are now a regular sight on the streets of @entity17 , as @entity9 continues to fight the 11 - month uprising joining forces : @entity2 pm @entity11 ( left ) and @entity3 president @entity12 ( right ) want the @entity5 to take further action in @entity7 the two leaders , who are reluctant to get dragged in militarily , also ' discussed the possibility of increasing the pressure on the @entity9 regime through additional sanctions '			1
the conversation came after the @entity47 floated ideas to send in a joint @entity5 - @entity50 peacekeeping force			1
that plan has been backed in part by the @entity12 administration , which feared it would be difficult to gain authorisation by the @entity55			2
chief among the hurdles is opposition by @entity59 and @entity60 , which vetoed a far less ambitious @entity55 action already this month			0
@entity59 has said peacekeepers could not be sent without @entity7 government approval , and officials in @entity65 have already rejected the proposal , calling it unjustified interference in internal affairs			0
' we support the @entity47 's decisions ... to try to end the violence and move toward a transition , ' secretary of state @entity69 said			2
destruction : a house in @entity17 has been left as rubble after being shelled by @entity7 forces raining down : bombs continue to fall on the city of @entity17 as the crackdown continues into a second week ' there are a lot of challenges to be discussed as to how to put into effect all of their recommendations			2
and certainly , the peacekeeping request is one that will take agreement and consensus			0
' so , we do n't know that it is going to be possible to persuade @entity7			0
they have already as of today rejected that , but i think this is what we are trying to explore , ' she told reporters after meeting with @entity101 foreign minister @entity100 at the @entity102			0
at the @entity104 , press secretary @entity103 said the administration has begun discussions with the @entity5 , the @entity47 and allies about how an eventual peacekeeping force could work			1
he said nothing about any @entity3 participation , but it would be unlikely in the near term			2
wounded : a young girl , injured in shelling earlier this month , sits in her @entity17 home as the brutal crackdown on opposition against @entity9 continues destruction : @entity17 , which is the centre of the uprising against @entity9 , is still being bombarded by rockets and mortars for now , talk of a peacekeeping force is preliminary , and largely theoretical			1
@entity103 said the discussion is about how peacekeepers ' could help to maintain peace in @entity7 , starting with there being a peace to keep '			0
a february 24 meeting is scheduled in @entity131 of the @entity33 that will plot efforts to compel @entity7 president @entity9 's regime to end its brutal crackdown on opponents			0
training : @entity7 rebels rehearse their moves which they continue to use against @entity9 's forces making a noise : despite unleashing thousands of mortars and rockets onto @entity17 , @entity9 has still not put down the rebel uprising against his rule ahead of that meeting , @entity145 said the @entity3 , @entity101 and other supporters of the @entity47 plan would be discussing ways to support the opposition and expand the delivery of humanitarian supplies to those in need			1
among the topics of discussion will be intensifying sanctions and diplomatic pressure on @entity9 and his inner circle , greater outreach to regime opponents in and outside of the country and boosting financial contributions to organizations like the @entity165 for the @entity166 and @entity166 that are working in @entity7			0
scars : doctors said they are treating dozens of young @entity7 injured during the violence at a hospital run by @entity172 - based @entity171 in @entity173 maimed : all five men have undergone reconstructive surgeries at @entity176 in @entity173			0
