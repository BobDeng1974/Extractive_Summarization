by @entity0 published : 05:24 est , 24 january 2014 updated : 19:43 est , 24 january 2014 @entity2 yesterday said he would not raise interest rates for some time , even as @entity5 ’s economy records the strongest growth in the developed world			2
the @entity9 ’s @entity8 confirmed that borrowing costs will not rise when unemployment falls below 7 per cent – a threshold the @entity9 set for considering an increase less than six months ago			1
mr @entity2 also said that any eventual increases ‘ would be gradual ’ and lead to rates ‘ somewhat lower than before the crisis ’ , when they averaged about 5 per cent			1
@entity9 governor @entity2 reassured mortgage - holders that there is no immediate need to increase interest rates the comments , to @entity5 executives at the @entity23 in @entity24 , @entity25 , were welcomed by the audience			1
one business leader said borrowing costs ‘ should remain low to help sustain the recovery ’			2
@entity30 said merely discussing the possibility of higher interest rates was ‘ a mark of success ’ for the economy , as it shows ‘ we have started to see the recovery take off ’ – but added that ‘ there is not a need for an immediate rise ’			1
the chancellor , who was also in @entity24 , would prefer that interest rates do not rise until after next may ’s general election			0
however , with the economy powering ahead , the jobless rate falling and concern growing about a credit boom , the interest rate - setting @entity43 could feel the need to act before then			2
the @entity9 ’s base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since march 2009 , but the economic revival has fuelled speculation that the @entity43 could soon raise it for the first time in nearly seven years			2
experts have warned that the move , which would hammer millions of families with mortgages , could snuff out the @entity5 recovery			0
in august , with unemployment at 7.8 per cent , the @entity9 said it would not consider raising rates until the jobless figure fell to 7 per cent – something it did not expect to happen until late 2016			2
the unemployment rate fell sharply to 7.1 % , putting it within a whisker of the 7 % target set by the @entity9 when it could consider putting up interest rates the policy – known as forward guidance – is now set for the scrapheap after data this week showed unemployment has fallen to 7.1 per cent			1
mr @entity2 said the @entity43 will ‘ evolve ’ and ‘ update ’ its forward guidance next month			1
the @entity9 has several options			0
it could ditch the link between joblessness and interest rates altogether ; lower the threshold to 6.5 or 6 per cent ; or incorporate other indicators such as wage growth			0
chancellor @entity30 has previously warned about the dangers of an interest rate rise the governor said that although the @entity5 , along with the @entity93 , is ‘ leading the pack ’ in terms of economic growth in the developed world , there are nearly 750,000 more @entity5 out of work than before the financial crisis struck , and another 750,000 part - time workers who want a full - time job			1
‘ many of the headwinds holding back the economy will remain for some time yet , ’ the @entity94 said			0
‘ a few quarters of growth driven by household spending represent a good start , but they are n’t sufficient			0
’ the chancellor agreed : ‘ the job is not done			0
it is not even half done			0
’ he said the next step would be for business investments and exports to become ‘ key components ’ of the recovery			0
mr @entity2 stressed in his speech : ‘ even though unemployment is falling faster than expected , the recovery has some way to run before it would be appropriate to consider moving away from the emergency setting of [ interest rates ] ... it is widely recognised that our 7 per cent threshold is not a trigger			1
’ @entity118 , who was also in @entity24 , defended mr @entity2			1
‘ to be fair , he always said that this was a threshold , not a trigger , ’ he told @entity120 television , adding that the governor ’s latest comments are ‘ consistent with that ’			0
@entity126 , the head of the @entity127 and a member of mr @entity2 ’s audience yesterday , said : ‘ business will welcome the governor ’s comments on interest rates			1
interest rates should remain low to help sustain the recovery			0
’ however , former @entity9 economist @entity136 said there was a 30 per cent chance of a rate increase by the end of the year , claiming such a move would be necessary ‘ in late 2014 ’ .			2

as economic recovery builds , unemployment has fallen to just 7.1 %
@entity9 had said it will consider interest rate rise when it hits 7 %
but @entity2 *appeared* to ditch the guidance to ease fears of a hike
the @entity9 has *denied* reports that mr @entity2 wants the chancellor to water down the help to *buy* *scheme* to prevent a new housing boom . a *spokesman* said claims that mr @entity2 wanted the *maximum* loan to be reduced from *£* *600,000* were ‘ completely without foundation ’ .
