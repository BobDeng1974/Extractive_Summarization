@entity28 @entity27 spokesperson for women @entity25 has thrown her support behind the campaign ' out - dated stereotypes about girls and boys and men and women , perpetuate gender inequality , which can feed into very serious problems such as domestic violence and the gender pay gap , ' senator @entity39 said			1
' the separate aisles of pink and blue common in many stores might seem harmless , especially to well - meaning relatives and friends , who are buying plenty of children ’s gifts at this time of the year			0

' she argues that gender stereotypes instilled in kids from a young age can lead to more complex problems like domestic violence later in life however the campaign has already come under fire from one child psychologist , who argues that the link between gender stereotyped toys and domestic violence is ' a stretch '			1
' these gender differences are hard wired , and while i ’m sure socialisation plays a role , to argue that toys in any way relate to domestic violence is , i think , too far a stretch , ' dr @entity111 told @entity119 on its website , @entity10 makes the argument that continuing to abide by ' old - fashioned ' gendered stereotypes could be damaging for young children			1
' listing toys as being either for girls or for boys could have the effect of alienating a boy from feeling okay about showing interest in say ‘ crafts and arts ’ and vice-versa for a girl who may otherwise have gravitated towards a remote control helicopter			0

the campaign calls on people to take the pledge not to purchase gendered toys this @entity1 , and also urges supporters to sign a petition with the aim of getting the @entity28 government to legislate against gendered marketing			1
