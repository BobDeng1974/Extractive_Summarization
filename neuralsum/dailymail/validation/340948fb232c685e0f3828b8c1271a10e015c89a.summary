families of @entity1 shot dead on the battlefield by @entity4 soldiers could sue the @entity5 for human rights violations after a @entity8 ruling			1
a judgment stated that cases in which an @entity1 was either shot dead or wounded fall within the jurisdiction of the @entity14			1
the landmark ruling could lead to over 1,200 claims , represented by @entity18 ’s controversial @entity17 ( @entity17 ) , being investigated in @entity4 courts			1
the families of @entity1 soldiers killed by @entity4 troops could sue the @entity5 for human rights violations after a @entity8 ruling last night the @entity5 said they were ‘ concerned ’ the court had taken such ‘ an expansive view of the @entity29 jurisdiction ’ and would take the case to the appeals court			1
they also said it would likely encourage ‘ large numbers of opportunistic ’ claims which would have to be investigated at heavy costs to the taxpayer			0
colonel @entity35 , former commander of @entity4 forces in @entity37 , said the judgment was ‘ absurd ’			1
he said : ‘ the prospect that every time @entity4 troops shoot or shell an enemy in battle they can be put before a court is beyond parody and utterly preposterous			2
‘ how on earth are our troops expected to attack the enemy or to defend themselves knowing that every shot they fire could land them in court			0
‘ there are two winners in this judgment - our country ’s enemies and the ambulance - chasing lawyers who will now be rubbing their hands together at the prospect of pocketing even more millions of pounds of taxpayer ’s hard - earned cash			0
’ colonel @entity61 , whose eve - of - battle speech inspired the nation before the @entity64 , added : ‘ i believe that these very lawyers have serious questions to answer about the abuse of the @entity4 ’s willingness to investigate such claims for personal gain and to that effect their credibility and motivation must be questioned			1
’ colonel @entity61 , former commanding officer of the @entity74 , @entity75 , ( centre ) said the lawyers that have put forward the ruling have ' serious questions to answer ' under the @entity29 , the state has a duty to investigate allegations of wrongdoing			1
to what extent the @entity84 applies to the activities of @entity4 armed forces in @entity1 was previously not clear and has resulted in extensive legal debate			2
the secretary of state accepted that anyone who was taken into the custody of @entity4 forces in @entity1 had certain rights under the convention			2
colonel @entity35 ( pictured ) , former commander of @entity4 forces in @entity37 , said the judgment was ‘ absurd ’ claimants however argued @entity100 1 of the @entity29 , the obligation to respect human rights , should also be applied to those shot on the battlefield			1
but the @entity5 refused to accept that individuals who were killed during security operations carried out by @entity4 forces in @entity1 were ‘ within the @entity4 ’s jurisdiction ’			1
on monday , mr @entity106 , who is the judge designated to deal with the cases on behalf of the @entity1 , ruled @entity100 1 applied to ‘ those test cases where the individual was shot by a @entity4 soldier ’			1
firstly , ‘ because such shootings occurred in the course of security operations in which @entity4 forces were exercising public powers that would normally be exercised by the government of @entity1 ’			2
secondly , ‘ because shooting someone involves the exercise of physical power over that person ’			0
he said @entity100 1 did not apply in cases where @entity4 military vehicles were involved in road traffic collisions			0
he did however state that in circumstances where a soldier killed someone during an armed conflict , the killing would be deemed legal , provided it was consistent with @entity129			0
in those cases the family members would be unable to claim compensation from the @entity4			0
@entity133 represent the majority of the claimants and they told the courts they expected the number of claims by the end of march 2015 to reach at least 1,230			0
the legal aid - funded firm was criticised last year after the @entity142 demolished its claims that soldiers tortured @entity1 detainees in may 2004			0
their claimants have been seeking orders from the court to require the secretary of state for defence to investigate alleged human rights violations			0
@entity133 said in a statement : ‘ he ( @entity154 ) has ruled that in respect of all the 1,200 plus judicial review cases he is dealing with , all of the following stations are within the jurisdiction of the @entity29			2
’ a judgment stated that cases in which an @entity1 was either shot dead or wounded fall within the jurisdiction of the @entity14 ( pictured the @entity29 building in @entity165 , @entity166 ) an @entity5 spokesman said : ‘ while the court has rejected all but one of @entity17 ’ attempts to expand our investigative obligations , we are concerned that it has taken such an expansive view of @entity29 jurisdiction			1
‘ the judgment does not require any change to conduct of @entity4 military operations but it is likely to encourage large numbers of opportunistic claims which must be investigated and litigated at heavy cost to taxpayers			2
‘ we will therefore be seeking leave to appeal the jurisdiction issues to the @entity186			0
’ a @entity17 spokesman said : ‘ this is a very important judgment clarifying the application of the @entity29 not just to @entity1 personnel in @entity1 but for future international peacekeeping operations and situations of armed conflict involving the @entity4			1
‘ it is very likely that this important question of legal principle will be appealed by the @entity197 and heard by the @entity198			0

judgment stated that cases where @entity1 was shot or wounded are *included*
ruling could lead to over 1,200 claims being investigated in @entity4 courts
@entity5 is ' concerned ' and will take the case to appeals court
colonel @entity35 , former commander , said judgement was ' absurd '
