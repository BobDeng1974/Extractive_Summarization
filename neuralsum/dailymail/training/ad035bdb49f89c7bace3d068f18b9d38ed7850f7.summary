the @entity19 and @entity20 want the christening of their son @entity5 to be an ' intimate , family affair ' @entity9 and @entity20 have already chosen to break with recent royal tradition and have their son christened at the @entity27 in @entity28 , because it is smaller and ‘ more personal ’ than @entity14			1
now the @entity1 has learnt that only the couple ’s closest family and friends will be attending			2

’ @entity34 refused to comment last night , saying : ‘ we will announce the full guest list in due course when we are ready to do so			0
’ but a royal source added : ‘ the christening will be a small , intimate and personal family affair			0
’ the couple ’s decision to use the @entity27 as a venue surprised many when it as announced earlier this month			1

a one kilo special gold coin minted to celebrate the christening it is understood that @entity9 and @entity20 favoured the @entity94 - decorated @entity27 because it is , in the words of one royal aide , ‘ a small , very personal venue ’			1
