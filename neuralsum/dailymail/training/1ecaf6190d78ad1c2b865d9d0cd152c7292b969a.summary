the first facial recognition app for @entity3 's @entity2 wearable computer has launched - and it claims to be able to spot your perfect date in a crowded room			1
it can scan the room , trying to match people with pictures takes from social networking and dating site			2
its makers claim it can even check the sex offenders register before deciding on a match			0
frame game : app designer @entity28 demonstrates how the software works for peace of mind the @entity31 app will cross-reference photographs against the sex offenders registry @entity31 can spot a face using the camera built into @entity2			2
it then sends this via the wearer 's mobile phone to a server and compare it to millions of records			0
in seconds , it will return a match complete with a name , additional photos and social media profiles			1
@entity50 , the developer of @entity31 , is also currently creating technology to allow the scanning of profile photos from dating sites such as @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
the technology will also allow users to scan photos against the more than 450,000 entries in the @entity62 and other criminal databases			1
called @entity31 , it blurs the lines between online and offline dating by allowing smartphone users to simply glance at someone nearby , or take their photo , and instantly see that person 's name , occupation and even visit their @entity75 , @entity76 or @entity77 profiles in real - time			1
@entity31 sends photographs wirelessly to a server , compare it to millions of records and in seconds return a match complete with a name , additional photos and social media profiles			1
@entity85 , the developer of @entity31 , is also creating technology to allow the scanning of profile photos from dating sites such as @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57			1
for added peace of mind , the user can also cross-reference the photos against more than 450,000 entries in the @entity62 and other criminal databases			2
keeping it real : @entity31 takes online dating offline @entity31 's creator @entity28 said : ‘ i believe that this will make online dating and offline social interactions much safer and give us a far better understanding of the people around us			2
‘ it 's much easier to meet interesting new people when we can simply look at someone , see their @entity75 , review their @entity107 page or maybe even see their dating site profile			0
often we were interacting with people blindly or not interacting at all			0
@entity110 can change all that			0
’ @entity31 is currently available on @entity113 testers – meaning that the developer is letting people outside the company examine how it works to help iron out bugs and glitches			2
however , @entity3 will not allow the app to be used for @entity2 beyond this as it contravenes its privacy rules - and @entity31 has not made it clear how it will distribute the app. following privacy concerns the firm included a line in its glass developer policies banning any @entity2 app that uses ' the camera or microphone to cross-reference and immediately present personal information identifying anyone other than the user , including use cases such as facial recognition and voice print			1
' @entity136 , deputy editor of tech mag @entity137 , thinks the app is a good idea , but that users should exercise caution			0
he said : ' it could be very handy if you 're not afraid of scaring people off with your creepy app. ' it 's evidently pretty clever but i think most people would find it quite invasive			0
' and is n't the point of dating to find out more about people ? this kind of defeats the object			0
' in terms of privacy , i assume it 's only finding information that you 've already put online , so it 's not really any more of a risk to privacy than adding photos to @entity75			0

@entity31 allows users to snap *strangers* and see their social media profiles
@entity3 *pledged* to ban facial recognition software - but app set to launch anyway
will also cross-reference photos with dating sites including @entity57
in addition , users can check photos against various criminal databases
