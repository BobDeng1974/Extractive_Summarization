@entity1 senator @entity0 cautioned on wednesday that the government 's health experts may not be as capable of containing @entity4 as they 're telling @entity6			1
' it 's a big mistake to downplay and act as if " oh , this is not a big deal , we can control all this			1
" this could get beyond our control , ' @entity0 , who has an md in optometry from @entity14 , told conservative radio host @entity17			1
' i think because of political correctness we ’re not really making sound , rational , scientific decisions on this , ' he warned			0
@entity0 later claimed , ' we should not underestimate the transmissibility ' of the virus , introducing doubt into the @entity28 's assertions that @entity4 can only be passed on through bodily fluids			1
the man , who has since been quarantined , was taken by ambulance to a hospital in @entity41 , @entity42 , and is now believed to have come in contact with as many as 100 people , including five children , from the time he began showing symptoms to the moment doctors discovered he had @entity4			2
that number does not include persons who were on his transnational flights , as he was not yet exhibiting symptoms at the time of travel			0
it can take up to 21 days for a person who has contracted the deadly disease to begin showing symptoms , which often include fever , muscle pain , vomiting and bleeding			0
@entity59 has ensued in @entity42 since details emerged on wednesday about the 42 - year - old man 's hospitalization			2
the @entity4 patient was revealed on wednesday to be @entity64			1
a neighbor of his family told @entity67 that when he was helped into an ambulance , @entity64 was ' throwing up all over the place			0
' @entity64 reportedly contracted @entity4 while helping family friends take their @entity4 - stricken daughter to the hospital in a taxi on sept. 15 in @entity74 , @entity37			2
the brother of woman also became infected with @entity4 and died a few days later , according to the @entity77			2
@entity79 press secretary @entity78 sought to restore calm to the situation yesterday , explaining that the @entity6 has the medical infrastructure to treat @entity4 victims , if necessary , in ways that will not ' pose a significant risk to other patients in the hospital , to the doctors and nurses who will be caring for that individual , and certainly does n’t post a significant risk to the broader community			1
' he also attempted to debunk accusations like @entity0 's			1
@entity4 does not spread as easily as the common cold , he assured reporters			2
the odds of an @entity4 epidemic occurring in the @entity6 are ' incredibly low			1
' ' @entity4 is not easily transmitted			2
it is n’t transmitted through the air like the flu , ' the @entity79 spokesman said			0
' it is not transmitted through water or food here in the @entity6			0
' the only way that @entity4 can be transmitted is through the bodily fluids of an individual who is already showing symptoms of being sick with @entity4 , ' he asserted , later noting that ' it is not possible to transmit @entity4 through the air			1
' you ca n't catch it through the air , ' he again promised			0
@entity0 , who is a likely 2016 presidential candidate , expressed concern that health officials were glossing over just how contagious the disease is , however , in his radio interview the same day			0
' my suspicion is that it 's a lot more transmissible than that if people who are taking every precaution are getting it , ' the @entity116 senator said			0
' there are people getting it who simply helped people get in or out of a taxicab , ' he said , indirectly referring to @entity64			0
at another point in the interview , @entity0 mocked president @entity131 's advice in 2009 that @entity6 could stop the spread of the @entity134 flu by coughing into their shirt sleeves instead of their hands			1
' i ca n't believe that you do n't think it 's enough of a plan to prevent worldwide pandemic to cough into your elbow , ' @entity0 told @entity17 , according to @entity141			1
' if you just bring your elbow up to your mouth and cough into it , surely that will stop a worldwide pandemic			0
' @entity64 , a @entity37 national who had traveled to the @entity6 from @entity37 on september 20 to visit family , has been quarantined at a @entity41 hospital for @entity4 after reportedly contracting the disease in @entity37 while putting an infected family friend into a taxi and riding with her to the hospital already , the @entity28 has raised it 's travel warning to the highest level possible - three - and warned @entity6 against travelling to @entity154 , @entity37 and @entity155 in order to avoid the possibility of accidentally contracting the infectious disease			1
the @entity79 indicated on wednesday that it has no intentions of placing new restrictions on travel to and from areas effected by the @entity4 outbreak , however			2
rather , the @entity131 administration ' has taken the step of recirculating our guidance ' to law enforcement agencies , the airline industry and medical professionals ' to make sure that people are aware that there is an important protocol that should be implemented if an individual presents with symptoms that are consistent with @entity4 , ' @entity78 said			0
the @entity79 official reassured the press that @entity64 was neither displaying nor experiencing symptoms or @entity4 during his flight			0
' so there ’s nothing about this case that we know so far that would indicate any weakness or any flaws in [ our border protection ] system right now , ' he insisted			0
but as another reporter pointed out minutes later , @entity78 's comments suggested that the @entity6 has not yet developed a way to effectively screen people who may have contracted @entity4 before they reach @entity6 and their bodily fluids become toxic			1
and before this week , the @entity28 had claimed that it was unlikely that an infected traveler would bring @entity4 to the @entity6 that assurance has clearly proven to be inaccurate			1
@entity0 expressed concerns wednesday that the troops president @entity131 is sending to @entity197 to help keep the peace in the @entity4 hot spot could end up becoming carriers of the disease and beginning their own epidemic			1
' you also have to be concerned about 3,000 soldiers getting back on a ship , ' he said			0
' can you imagine if a whole ship full of our soldiers catch @entity4 ? '			0

' it 's a big mistake to downplay and act as if " oh , this is not a big deal , we can control all this , ' " @entity0 said wednesday
@entity0 warned that @entity28 may not be as capable of containing @entity4 as they 're telling @entity6
' we should not underestimate the transmissibility ' of the virus , he said .
@entity0 has an md in optometry from @entity14
the @entity28 has asserted that @entity4 can only be passed on through bodily fluids
