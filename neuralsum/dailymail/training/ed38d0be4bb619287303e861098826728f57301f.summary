@entity0 has vowed to follow in @entity2 ’s footsteps and use a bitter experience as added motivation after suffering the worst collapse in golf history at the @entity8 @entity7			1
nine days on from that stunning loss , when he threw away a ten shot lead with 13 holes to play , the @entity9 admits he has been doing plenty of soul - searching			1
‘ it was n’t just a big golf lesson it was a huge life lesson , ’ he said			0
‘ it was like what happened to @entity2 a few years ago at the masters			1
when he lost that back nine lead ( in 2011 ) it was shocking and sad to see and it ’s tough to handle those situations			2
' but if you deal with it honestly and gain more motivation then you can do what he did and come out a few months later and win the @entity29 by 20 shots or whatever			2
so i am very glad i went through it			0
if i had won in @entity8 again ( for a fourth time ) everybody would have joked : " oh yeah , why do n’t they rename the place the @entity0 golf course and all those sort of things			1
” ‘ and yeah it would have been good to gain a few more world ranking points and another beautiful trophy in my house			0
but what happened instead – that will be better for me			2
’ @entity29 champion @entity0 was in good spirits here on tuesday as he looked forward to the @entity58 on thursday , where a star - studded field also includes the likes of the world numbers one and two , @entity2 and @entity32 , plus @entity63 and @entity64			1
but the @entity9 star said he hopes to use the experience as motivation for future performances northern irishman @entity2 experienced something similar at the masters in 2011 ‘ i think @entity8 just shows you that @entity9 engineering does n’t always work , ’ he said , smiling			1
‘ it does usually , but one in a while it comes unstuck			0
’ @entity0 admitted that over-confidence played its part in his downfall			2
‘ i think when you start off a final round with a big lead and then you begin birdie , birdie , par , birdie , you almost feel like not much can go wrong , ’ he said			1
‘ and in golf , that little bit of too much confidence can hurt and it ’s a very fine line			0
‘ how i felt that day is not the person i am and not the person i want to be			0
it did not feel natural to me and it becomes very difficult because it is an unknown situation , and one you do n’t want to be in			0
‘ afterwards i asked myself how did i get into it and why did i get into it			0
and all those answers i got , they will prove important to me going forward			0
’ @entity2 was leading until the final round , he has experienced considerable success in the years after			1

@entity0 was 10 shots clear on the final round in @entity8
but @entity0 capitulated and @entity100 earned a shock *victory*
the @entity9 said the experience will help motivate him
a similar thing happened to @entity2 at the 2011 masters
