by @entity0 @entity1 : 19:21 est , 30 december 2013 @entity2 : 19:30 est , 30 december 2013 taking it easier : the @entity4 made 341 official engagements this year - 85 fewer than in 2012 the @entity4 significantly reduced the number of engagements she carried out last year , handing over more duties to younger royals			1
the 87 - year - old monarch conducted 341 official visits , ceremonies , audiences and investitures over the last 12 months , compared to 425 in 2012 - a drop of about 20 per cent			1
although the @entity17 in 2012 kept her busier than usual , her 2013 diary was noticeably slimmer than the 370 engagements she undertook in 2011 and the 444 in 2010			1
the last time she fulfilled foreign duties was in 2011			0
the queen ’s workload is still prodigious , particularly for a woman two decades over the average age of retirement			0
indeed , based on these latest figures she still carries out engagements at a rate of almost one a day - in addition to the many hours she spends dealing with the red boxes full of official papers every day of the year except @entity35			1
@entity36 has always been at pains to deny any suggestion that the head of state is plans to abdicate or even semi-retire in favour of her eldest son , prince @entity42			1
he turned 65 in november and is the longest - serving heir apparent in @entity46 history			0
however the latest tally is a sign that the @entity4 is , inevitably , slowing down			0
earlier this year , palace officials were forced to announce what many royal watchers had known for some time - that the @entity4 had decided to completely scale back on her long - haul foreign travel			2
in november @entity42 attended the bi-annual @entity53 in @entity54 on behalf of his mother for the first time in her six decade reign			2
indeed , the last time the @entity4 undertook any foreign engagement was back in 2011 - although it is very likely she will attend the 70th anniversary commemorations of the @entity61 in @entity62 next year			2
back at home , prince @entity42 , @entity63 and now even her grand - son , prince @entity64 , are taking on more of her physically strenuous duties such as investitures , which require the @entity4 to stand on her feet , pinning on medals and wielding her father ’s sword , for more than an hour at a time			1
a senior royal source told the @entity73 : ‘ the simple truth is that the @entity4 is simply unable to keep working at the same pace she has done for the last 60 years			0
more duties : prince @entity42 and @entity63 are taking on more of the @entity4 's physically demanding roles ‘ she is n’t retiring , she is n’t taking it easy , but she is scaling back some of her more strenuous duties			1
’ @entity80 , the chairman of the @entity81 on the @entity82 , who organised the commission of a special stained glass window in @entity86 to mark the event , also insisted that she was not scaling back her duties			2
‘ on the contrary , the fact that at age 87 she is still carrying out 341 official duties shows that @entity4 continues to be highly devoted to her role as our queen and i believe that she will continue in that role for many years to come , ’ he said			1
‘ she works her way through reams of papers , she undertakes numerous audiences and she remains an example of duty and service to this country			0
’ the @entity4 ’s 92 - year - old husband , the @entity106 , has also seen a reduction in his workload			1
in 2012 he conducted 325 official engagements , which fell to fewer than 200 this past year			1
this is largely due to an extensive period of convalescence following surgery earlier this year			0
passing the baton : prince @entity64 and the @entity115 have also taken on events , though fewer as they are not full - time royals @entity42 was the busiest member of the @entity119 with more than 500 official engagements under his belt , followed by @entity63			1
last week the prince was named by a @entity124 newspaper as the hardest working member of any @entity119 in @entity126			0
at the bottom of the list are the youngest royals , prince @entity64 , prince @entity130 and the @entity115			0
the brothers carried out just over 50 engagements each , but this is due to the fact that both had full - time jobs in the military and are not classed as full - time working royals			2
prince @entity130 also undertook a four - month posting in @entity140 and a four - week charity trek to the @entity142			0
@entity115 , 31 , undertook just 43 engagements , but her staff have always insisted she does not want to be a full - time working royal either			0
she went on maternity leave in june in advance of the birth of her first baby , @entity151 , the following month .			0

the 87 - year - old monarch conducted 341 official engagements in 2013
this is down 85 from 425 in 2012 , the year of her @entity82
other royals , such as prince @entity42 and @entity63 , have taken on extra
