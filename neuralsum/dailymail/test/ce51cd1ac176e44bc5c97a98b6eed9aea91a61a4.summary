you do n't become one of the most successful designers that @entity3 has ever produced without causing some controversy			1
but @entity6 's latest comments will undoubtedly raise a few eyebrows			2
the 80 - year - old fashion designer , who has dressed everyone from @entity10 to @entity11 , has made a name for himself putting a-listers of all shapes and sizes in his creations , but it turns out he has harsh criticism for a few body shapes in particular			0
@entity6 , who has amassed a personal fortune of £ 5billion over the length of his 40 - year - career , emphasised his appreciation of a ' healthy ' look			0
he said : ' i do n't like muscle boy			0
not too much gym ! ' i like somebody healthy , somebody solid , who looks after his body but does n't use his muscles too much			0
' interestingly , the aesthetic for the brand seems to somewhat differ from the designer 's views - with several of the @entity6 underwear adverts featuring muscly boxer - clad male models			1
@entity51 's ex , @entity50 , 29 , is one celebrity that may not agree with @entity6 's disapproval of men who work out too much @entity55 , 36 , is another celebrity that would lock horns with @entity6 and his view of plastic surgery as ' idiocy ' interestingly , @entity61 , 30 , has modelled underwear for @entity6 before , showing off his unashamedly muscly body the designer himself , who has never denied claims that he is gay , was also outspoken about the way that certain gay men dress			1
mr @entity6 declared that a homosexual man does n't need to dress in a camp manner			2
. he said : ' when homosexuality is exhibited to the extreme to say , " ah , you know i 'm homosexual , " - that has nothing to do with me - a man has to be a man			0
' the @entity26 - born designer has never denied that he is gay , but in the interview he condemned men who ' dress homosexual ' a @entity10 fan ! in the interview , @entity6 admitted that he preferred the ' natural look ' on women , rather than women with breast implants and his criticism was n't only reserved for men			1
when questioned on women opting for plastic surgery , the designer described it as ' idiocy ... a small breast does not have to become big			1
' in the interview , the designer highlighted his appreciation of women with natural beauty , in particular those who chose to age gracefully			1
he said : ' i prefer to look at a natural woman			0
a woman should be courageous to become older , not be desperate to look younger than her age			2

in an interview , @entity6 , 80 , described *cosmetic* surgery as idiocy
*believes* women ' should not be desperate to look younger than her age '
the @entity3 designer also said he did n't like men who looked too muscly
