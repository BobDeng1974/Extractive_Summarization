@entity0 was announced today the new underwear model for @entity2			1
the 20 - year - old pop star 's new role had many teenagers swooning , but most women were underwhelmed by the news , with one commenting on @entity9 , ' that 's an anti-marketing strategy '			1
but from @entity12 to @entity13 , the baby singer is just the latest in a long line of muscle - bound hunks to pull on @entity18 clinging briefs - we examine how he matches up			2
@entity0 looked predictably smug in the black and white images , staring into the camera with what has become his trademark furrowed brow			0
and who can blame him ? by signing up to the campaign , @entity0 has joined the ranks of an elite group of male actors , models and sportsmen who have filled @entity2 's white cotton smalls			2
from @entity12 , who took the campaign global in 1992 to @entity51 's @entity50 , there has always been a stir around the designer 's underwear campaigns			0
while before finding fame in @entity56 , @entity13 also tried his hand at posing in the buff while looking moodily into the distance			0
so does @entity0 really live up to his predecessors ' legacy ? or did mr @entity2 drop the ball ( no pun intended ) on this one ? @entity64 has dug out the finest male @entity2 underwear ads of all time			1
we 'll let you decide whether @entity0 's posing is perfect or a bit pants ... @entity12 posed in a series of underwear ads for @entity2 in 1992 that were shot by @entity74 @entity12 got intimate with a little - known @entity76 model called @entity77 , who appeared topless , for the pictures although the adverts have done wonders for the careers of several men , there are mixed emotions from the stars about their involvement in the campaigns			1
@entity12 once said of his shoot with @entity77 : ' the underwear modelling i did for @entity2 with @entity77 was not good in retrospect , but at the time it got me a lot of attention from the ladies			2
' explaining that – along with the rap career – to my kids is going to be embarrassing when they are old enough to ask			0
' meanwhile , @entity13 , who is soon to become a global film star when @entity100 is released , says underwear modelling was a sound financial decision			0
he said : ' i got lucky with that gig because quite early on i could be picky about what i did , where i did it			0
' and because i was on contracts , i was working maybe 10 days a year and getting paid really well for it			0
