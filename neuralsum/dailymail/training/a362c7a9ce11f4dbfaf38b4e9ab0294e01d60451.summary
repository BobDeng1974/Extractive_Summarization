an arbitration panel ordered @entity1 and @entity2 to pay $ 10 million in a fraud dispute with a promotions company for what it called an ' unparalleled pageant of international perjury , fraud and conspiracy ' that covered up his use of performance - enhancing drugs			1
@entity14 - based @entity13 announced the 2 - 1 decision against the former cyclist when its lawyers said monday they had asked @entity19 ' 116th @entity18 in @entity14 to confirm the arbitration ruling , dated feb. 4			1
the panel included a neutral chairman , who ruled in favor of @entity13 , and one person selected by each side			2
@entity13 paid @entity1 and @entity2 , the since - dissolved team management company , about $ 12 million in bonuses during @entity1 's career , when he won seven @entity30 titles			1
those victories were stripped after @entity1 and his @entity33 teams were found to have used banned performance - enhancing drugs			2
despite allegations of cheating , @entity1 continued to deny doping and the company settled with @entity1 and paid him $ 7 million inj 2006			1
the company sued @entity1 to get its money back after @entity1 's cheating was exposed by a report from the @entity54 and a televised confession interview with @entity56			1
the case was sent back to the original arbitration panel of independent chairman @entity59 , @entity13 selection @entity60 and @entity1 pick @entity62			1
in the 2005 arbitration hearings , @entity1 testified under oath that he did not use performance - enhancing drugs			1

deception demands real , meaningful sanctions			0
' @entity1 attorney , @entity74 , declined comment			2
' we are very pleased with this result , ' said @entity13 's president and founder , @entity80			2

@entity62 ' dissent also attacked @entity13 , writing that in 2005 the arbitration panel had found the company to have engaged in selling insurance in @entity19 without a license , which could have exposed it to more than $ 22 million in damages under @entity1 's original claims			1
