by @entity0 and @entity1 and @entity2 cats have passed @entity4 to humans for the first time in an outbreak feared to have been caused by badgers			1
two people from the same household are being treated for bovine tuberculosis after they caught the disease from their kitten			1
two other cat owners have been infected with a dormant form of @entity4			1
nine cats were infected in the @entity17 in a matter of weeks			2
cats have passed @entity4 to humans for the first time in an outbreak feared to have been caused by badgers			1
nine of the animals were infected in the @entity17 in a matter of weeks - including 18 - month - old @entity26 ( pictured ) , which has run away six were put down or have died , two have survived , but one , an 18 - month - old tabby called @entity29 , has run away			2
seven of the cats had bite wounds , which vets say probably came from fighting with badgers , who are prolific carriers of bovine tb			2
in recent years , scientists have warned that cats could spread tb to their owners , but these are believed to be the first documented cases in the world			1
the infection was passed to each of the patients during an unprecedented outbreak of the disease among cats in @entity48 , @entity49 , last year			1
the patients , whose diagnoses were revealed last night , are responding to treatment , according to @entity52 , which classified the risk of further transmissions as ‘ very low ’			0
the alarm was raised by vet @entity56 after a series of cats – including his own pet , @entity29 – started displaying chronic lung conditions and suspicious wounds			0
tb in cats is rare , with barely 25 cases seen each year in the @entity64			0
last year ’s @entity48 outbreak was unprecedented			2
dr @entity56 , clinical director of the @entity67 in @entity48 , said the disease had its roots in an outbreak of bovine @entity4 among cows on the outskirts of the town			1
speaking exclusively to the @entity74 last night , he said : ‘ my colleague saw a cat which had a lesion that was n’t healing so we looked for @entity4			2
‘ there were cases dotted around @entity48 with a cluster of cases in and around @entity83			2
‘ it ’s quite unusual for cats to get tb but not unheard of , but it is quite rare for a cluster of cats like this to get it			0
’ @entity52 officials said the two patients who had been infected by the @entity93 were undergoing treatment			0
two other owners were diagnosed with ‘ latent tb ’ , which means they have been exposed to the infection but are not displaying symptoms			1
dr @entity98 , of @entity52 , said : ‘ these are the first documented cases of cat - to - human transmission			0
‘ although @entity52 has assessed the risk of people catching this infection from infected cats as being very low , we are recommending that household and close contacts of cats with confirmed @entity4 infection should be assessed and receive public health advice			1
‘ it ’s important to remember that this was a very unusual cluster of @entity4 in domestic cats			1
’ @entity4 has ravaged the @entity64 farming industry , with farms forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with the disease each year			1
above , the bacteria that causes @entity4 @entity119 , chief executive of the charity @entity120 , said : ‘ in the @entity64 we are a nation of cat lovers , so this may prove quite shocking for people who may now look at their pets in a different light			1
‘ although i would stress that the risk of catching @entity4 from a cat is likely to remain very low , this is a stark reminder that @entity4 is still a problem in the @entity64 today , with almost 9,000 people developing it last year			1
’ dr @entity56 said the two people with active @entity4 were infected by a kitten			1
he added : ‘ this cat was quite young and was suffering from an open sore which makes the risk of infection greater			0
@entity4 is a serious infection which affects the lungs			1
it can also affect other parts of the body - such as the bones and kidneys - and can cause meningitis			0
some cases can be prevented with the @entity146 vaccine but it is currently only given to people who are thought to be at high risk			0
the vaccine is rarely given to people over the age of 16 and never to those over 35 as it does n't work very well in adults			0
in children and young adults the vaccine is 70 to 80 per cent effective against the most severe forms of @entity4 , such as tb meningitis			2
it is less effective in preventing respiratory disease which is the more common form in adults			0
source : @entity160 ‘ before the pet was diagnosed with @entity4 , the owners may have been cleaning the wound without wearing gloves or taking other precautions			1
’ six of the infected cats lived in homes within 250 yards of each other on a housing estate near @entity83			0
the other three lived within three miles			0
some 39 people who had come into contact with the cats were offered @entity4 screening , including dr @entity56 , his wife @entity175 and four children			1
their cat @entity26 was one of those infected – and has since disappeared			0
dr @entity56 , 52 , who has three dogs and four other cats , said : ‘ @entity26 was sat on my lap one day and i felt a lump on his leg			0
we had already had a few cases so i had him checked			0
he was responding well to treatment but has since gone missing			0
’ he fears the tabby was killed in an accident and says it is unlikely @entity26 could be spreading the infection further			0
@entity4 has ravaged the @entity64 farming industry , with farms forced to slaughter 30,000 cows with the disease each year			1
badgers are blamed for accelerating its spread , and the government is trialling a controversial cull of the animals to limit the problem			2
professor @entity202 , of the @entity203 , said : ‘ testing of nearby herds revealed a small number of infected cattle with the same strain of @entity4 as the cats			1
‘ however , direct contact of the cats with these cattle was unlikely considering their roaming ranges			0
the most likely source of infection is infected wildlife , but cat - to - cat transmission can not be ruled out			0
’ cattle herds with confirmed cases of bovine tb in the area have been placed under movement restrictions to prevent the spread of disease .			2

two people have been diagnosed with active @entity4 while two have latent @entity4
nine cats in @entity228 and @entity49 were *investigated* for @entity4 infection
all the pets were taken to the same veterinary *surgery* in @entity48
*experts* *unclear* how the animals contracted the disease
bacteria can spread to humans if it is breathed in , enters a cut or is ingested
