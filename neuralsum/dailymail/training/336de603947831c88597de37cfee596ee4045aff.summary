@entity0 warned thursday night in @entity1 that the @entity1 @entity2 will become a dinosaur – not an elephant – if it continues to embrace the political center			1
' i suspect that if the @entity2 sticks with the establishment it will lose , ' he told @entity9 after a speech to the @entity11			1
the @entity2 ' has got to reach the @entity13 community , but it 's also got to reach that blue - collar community that @entity15 got to vote for him in huge numbers			0
i 'm not sure at the moment that they 're positioning themselves to do that			0
' @entity11 is an annual three - day mecca for constitutional evangelists , @entity25 shock troops , full - throated abortion opponents and gun rights activists			2
many of them think the @entity2 is only slightly less liberal and nanny - statist than the president			0
@entity0 fit right in , keeping backstage handlers waiting for his appointment to test a lapel microphone while he smoked a cigar in the cold , outside the @entity37 resort hotel where more than a thousand stayed into the dinner hour to hear him			2
the @entity57 political contrarian , long at the helm of the @entity57 @entity44 , plied the conservative audience with a dry - witted vision of how his political travails could show disaffected @entity1 right - wingers the way forward			1
@entity44 , he boasted , is ' an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels			2
' but do n't confuse him with the tea party , he said after the applause ended			1
' we 're not the tea party , ' @entity0 insisted one - on - one			1
' our job is not to influence one political party			0
we 're not an outlier from the @entity45			0
' and unlike the @entity43 phenomenon , which peels off disaffected @entity2 who believe their traditional party has moved too far left , he said , his group ' is not just retired half - colonels who 've always voted @entity11 and now they 're @entity44			1
we 're dragging them from across the spectrum			1
' @entity0 's rhetoric about immigration , @entity57 's @entity87 foundation , political correctness and regulation run amok made up a song he sang to a crowd that had already memorized the verses			1
' if you discuss immigration , it means you 're a bad person , ' he complained – ' that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else			0
' and @entity0 spared no harsh words for @entity101 , saying that he sees ' an @entity1 president who does n't have the courage ' to fight against @entity105 terror			1
@entity101 , he claimed , lacks the vision to see ' what has gone wrong , and why those three people were arrested on the streets of the @entity1 yesterday			2
' that was a reference to the trio of @entity113 men who were detained by the @entity114 after they began the process of traveling to @entity116 for training with the @entity118 terror army – with the intention of bringing death and destruction back to @entity1			1
' we must stand firm and defend our @entity87 culture , ' @entity0 said , earnign his first boisterous applause			0
' we must make it clear that we believe in common law and not @entity128 law			0
' he called radical @entity130 ' an enemy within ' both the @entity1 and the @entity57			1
@entity0 also told @entity9 that prime minister @entity133 's government was wrong to ask the @entity134 and other news outlets to withhold the name of @entity138 resident @entity137 , who the paper identified on thursday as the infamous @entity118 executioner ' @entity140			1
' ' of course they should have told us his name , ' he said			0
' we should have heard it weeks ago			1
this information 's been known for a long time			0
' @entity0 said ' the @entity2 is going through the same crisis of identity as the @entity56 in @entity57 ' ' if you discuss immigration , it means you 're a bad person , ' he complained to a thousand convention - goers – ' that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else ' he was quick , as always , to link talk of @entity118 to @entity57 's immigration ' crisis , ' consisting of a doors - wide - open policy to the rest of the @entity161			1
' by sheer coincidence , ' he said , @entity137 's name was published ' on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the @entity57			0
' he also hit out against cage , the @entity57 ngo that often advocates on behalf of radicalized @entity130 and brands their detractors ' islamophobes			2
' ' yes , yes , yes ! ' @entity0 exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most @entity57			1
' it 's politcal correctness ! ' i mean , we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of @entity138 saying and shouting things that – if you and i did them , we 'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order			1
' ' we actually have a @entity87 culture , ' he added			0
' it 's actually in our @entity188 , so let 's stand up for it			0
' is that xenophobic ? @entity0 does n't think so			0
' the thing about us , ' he said of the @entity57 , ' is that we have been , of all the @entity195 countries , the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to @entity57			2
' while ' private observance ' of any religion ' is fine , ' he insisted , ' unless we live under one law we 're in trouble			0
' @entity44 typically sees its share of trouble in the @entity57 press , usually when one of its own makes a public gaffe worthy of @entity209			1
@entity11 's lineup includes @entity211 , whose teleprompter played tricks on her last month in @entity214 , leaving her rambling for minutes the @entity11 conference draws conservatives from all over the @entity1 , but they share the same message like any political force testing its boundaries by casting a wide net , it would be recognizable to @entity1 conservatives who have had to contend with their own brand of bad publicity			2
@entity225 , a @entity2 @entity226 candidate , famously self - imploded after musing on whether abortions should be allowed in cases of ' legitimate rape			0
' @entity211 just last month lost track of her teleprompter during a key @entity214 speech and rambled aimlessly for what seemed like hours , causing some to wonder if she was intoxicated			0
an ocean away , @entity44 councillor @entity234 was kicked out this month after she was filmed saying she has ' a problem with people with negroid features			1
' and social media accounts belonging to @entity44 activist @entity240 were plastered recently with claims that his home town of @entity244 is a ' sh * thole ' and ' full of p * * * s. ' his @entity249 account called @entity252 ' the @entity251 ' and labeled @entity253 ' pick pocketing criminals			2
' @entity240 insisted that his account was hacked , but the damage was done			2
@entity0 threw up his hands and suggested that idiots will be idiots			0
' well , look , ' he told @entity9 , ' people like @entity234 are local councillors			1
they are very low - level people in @entity44			2
they 're not major players			0
' ' yes , we get people who say stupid things in @entity44			1
i do n't approve or condone any of it			0

@entity0 spoke with @entity9 after a speech at the @entity11
the @entity57 @entity44 leader tried to buck up @entity1 right - wingers who see their tea party goals *dissolving* in a sea of centrist @entity275
he insisted that @entity44 is ' not just retired half - colonels who 've always voted @entity11 *...* we 're dragging them from across the spectrum '
bashed @entity133 for *refusing* to publicly identify @entity118 executioner ' @entity140 , ' saying ' we should have heard it weeks ago '
complained about ' politically correct ' groups like cage ' saying and shouting things that if you and i did them , we 'd find ourselves behind bars '
@entity0 addressed *controversies* involving @entity240 and @entity234 , admitting : ' yes , we get people who say stupid things in @entity44 '
