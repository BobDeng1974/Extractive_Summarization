two men were pictured wearing blood - spattered orange jumpsuits with knives held to their throats outside @entity13 today as part of @entity1 protests demanding stronger action against @entity3			1
however their actions have been ' condemned ' by a @entity19 group , who said mr @entity5 's death should not be used for political gain			1
' the @entity1 activists have a right to protest and demand extra weapons , what they do not have the right to do is mock mr @entity5 â€™s death and recreate the execution			1
' we reject this and condemn it without hesitation			0
what today should be about is @entity55 and mr @entity5 's family , not about trying to use the death for political gain			1
' several hundred @entity1 activists , some of whom have been on hunger strike in central @entity4 since wednesday , are demanding heavy weapons and anti-tank missiles for use against @entity3			1
they fear the town of @entity66 , on the @entity69 - @entity68 border , is about to be overrun by the terror group , which could lead to another massacre			1
their actions are likely to increase the emotional strain on @entity5 's family , who have already said they are ' numb with grief '			2
paying tribute to her husband today , @entity78 said : ' as a family we are devastated by the news of his death			2
there are few words to describe how we feel at this moment			0
' @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , and all of @entity5 's family and friends are numb with @entity93 was a decent , caring human being			2
his interest was in the welfare of others			0
' he will be remembered for this and we as a family are extremely proud of him and what he achieved and the people he helped			0
' mr @entity5 's brother also expressed hatred for the terrorists , describing the killers as ' scum ' , and saying he hoped they ' get what 's coming to them '			1
protest : some activists have vowed to go on hunger strike outside @entity13 until their demands are met violent : a man brandishing a bloodied axe stages a mock - execution on the pavement outside @entity13 hurt : the protest will likely cause further hurt to mr @entity5 's family who say they are already ' numb with grief ' elsewhere today the @entity122 also organised a march to @entity124 , calling for @entity125 to halt it 's bombing campaign against @entity3 in @entity127			1

referring to the brutal murder of @entity125 aid worker @entity5 at the hands of @entity131 @entity134 , 36 , from @entity135 said he had ' every sympathy ' with his family , but said dropping bombs is not the answer			2
mr @entity134 said @entity125 inflicts ' equal barbarity ' on the people of @entity127 , but people here feel ' distanced ' from it			0
' whether you see someone being beheaded or being hit by a drone strike ... it makes no difference			0
