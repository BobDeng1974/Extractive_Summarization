by @entity0 , @entity1 political editor published : 06:25 est , 2 october 2012 updated : 08:02 est , 2 october 2012 income tax could be increased by a @entity7 government to fund other tax cuts , a member of @entity4 ’s treasury team has revealed			1
in remarks which will risk being seen as a @entity7 tax bombshell , @entity9 told delegates at the party 's conference that a policy review would consider a hike in direct taxes to shift the burden away from indirect charges like @entity20			2
and in another shock move , shadow work and pensions secretary @entity21 today suggested universal benefits like bus passes , tv licences and heating allowances for wealthy pensioners could also be axed			1
@entity4 's speech risks being oversshadowed by his frontbench floating ideas based on @entity33 's ' zero - based spending review ' both ideas emerged from discussions of @entity37 ’ announcement of a ‘ zero - based spending review ' that will look at every pound spent by government			1
but the prospect of tax rises and benefit cuts could overshadow @entity4 ’s keynote speech at the @entity7 conference in @entity46 today , where he hopes to portray himself as in touch with voters ’ concerns			1
stung by criticism of a lack of policies , he will announce a series of education and economic reforms designed to present @entity7 as a credible alternative government			0
however , policy kite - flying by two shadow ministers risks undermining mr @entity4 ’s relaunch			2
ms @entity9 , who was promoted to the treasury team in may , insisted nothing on tax policy was ‘ set in stone ’ and signalled that the burden of @entity20 , which @entity7 has long called to be reduced , could be cut if income tax rates went up			1
asked if the balance between direct and indirect taxation would be looked at by @entity7 , she said : ‘ yes is the simple answer			0
shadow work and pensions secretary @entity21 today said the balance between between universal benefits and targeted benefits has ' got to be looked at ' ‘ in this economic climate , i do n’t think anything is set in stone any more			1
' i think everything needs to be looked at and everything needs to be considered and everything needs to be reviewed , ’ she told a @entity83 fringe event			0
@entity37 , the shadow chancellor , said yesterday it was too early to make promises on tax : ‘ we can not make any commitments now that the next @entity7 government will be able to reverse particular tax rises or spending cuts			1
‘ because , unlike @entity92 , we will not make promises we can not keep			0
’ but he criticised mr @entity93 ’s aborted vat hike on pasties and caravans and later called for vat to be cut to five per cent for a year on home improvements			0
today treasury ministers said @entity7 's existing proposal for a reduction in @entity20 from 20 per cent to 17.5 per cent would cost £ 12.5 billion this year			1
@entity100 , economic secretary to the treasury , said : ' @entity7 have let the cat out of the bag – if elected , their plans mean a £ 500 tax bombshell for every person who works hard and wants to get on in life			2
' @entity7 is n't learning			0
they still stand for more borrowing and more debt - and higher taxes			0
' later a @entity7 spokesman said : ' @entity9 was stating the obvious			0
of course we will have to consider what we say in our manifesto on tax after this government has raised vat , put up taxes for pensioners and cut the top rate of tax for the very richest			2
' today mr @entity21 , who famously left a note in the @entity122 joking that there was ‘ no money left ’ , indicated that @entity7 would also re-examine universal benefits for pensioners			1
‘ there ’s always been a balance in the welfare state between universal benefits and targeted benefits , and i ’m afraid that as part of @entity4 ’s zero - based review , that balance has got to be looked at , ' he told @entity136 's today programme			1
labour strategists were quick to play down the significance of the remarks , and insisted mr @entity4 would not be touching on universal benefits in today ’s speech			2
mr @entity21 added : “ i work on the assumption that we ’re going to inherit a dog ’s breakfast in 2015 , the national debt ’s going to be over £ 400bn higher than it was at the last @entity144			0
‘ savings are going to have to be made and i think there will be savings that are needed on welfare spending too			0
and our challenge is how we spend that money differently to support more people			0

shadow treasury minister says a @entity7 government would look at income tax rises to fund a vat cut
