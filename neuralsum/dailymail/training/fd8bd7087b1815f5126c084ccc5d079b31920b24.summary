@entity0 has come under pressure to follow @entity3 's example tighten border controls ministers were last night under pressure to tighten border controls for @entity9 citizens after @entity3 demanded ‘ proof of income ’ from expats hoping to live in the country			1
the move – taken in response to the country ’s economic crisis – was said by one @entity19 mp to have ‘ driven a coach and horses ’ through the @entity9 ’s cherished principle of the free movement of peoples , and immediately triggered calls for @entity0 to adopt tougher measures			2
@entity27 hopes to save more than € 1 billion euros ( £ 780 million ) a year by clamping down on ‘ economic migrants ’ from other @entity9 countries , including the @entity30			1
a new ministerial order , slipped out by the @entity3 government on july 9 , states that any @entity9 citizen living in @entity3 for more than three months must prove they will not become a financial burden on the @entity35 by producing a job contract or documents confirming they have enough money to support themselves			1
if they are jobless , they must also show they are covered by health insurance			0
the decree , which potentially affects thousands of @entity30 seeking a new life in the country , declares that @entity3 will now adopt a stricter interpretation of the ‘ free movement ’ principle			1
the @entity3 government has justified the measures by pointing to @entity53 7 of the 2004 @entity9 directive on free movement , which gives @entity9 member states the power to define it ‘ without prejudice to national border controls ’ – in other words , entry conditions can be imposed on other @entity9 citizens by member governments			1
the @entity30 has also enacted the provision – and the @entity64 insists that it does demand that @entity9 citizens should not be ‘ an unreasonable burden on public funds ’ before allowing them to stay in the @entity30			1
however , @entity68 , who served as immigration minister between 2008 and 2010 , told @entity70 last night that the powers were almost never used			0
he said : ‘ we do have the powers to deport @entity9 citizens – but they are ignored by the @entity30 authorities			1
we should heed the @entity3 example and change our approach			2
it is only fair that we enforce the laws available to us and stop turning a blind eye to abuses by @entity9 citizens			1
’ mr @entity68 revealed that when he was a minister he tried to deport a group of @entity83 rough - sleepers who had set up camp in @entity87 town centre – but was repeatedly told by officials that he had no powers to do so			0
‘ the idea that we check bank statements to ensure these people are not a burden is just nonsense , ’ he said			0
‘ freedom of movement is still the prevailing doctrine			0
’ the @entity3 government admits in a preamble to the legislation that it has failed in the past to regulate immigration from within the @entity9			1
this , it says , ‘ has implied a serious economic loss to @entity3 , especially because of the impossibility of guaranteeing the refund of expenditure caused by the provision of health and social services to @entity111 citizens ’			1
tough times : @entity3 demonstrators take to the streets to protest against the country 's austerity measures since 2007 , @entity9 citizens living in @entity3 for more than three months have had to register with the authorities , but there have been no checks on their financial situation			1
@entity30 diplomats in @entity27 are trying to establish how the rule change will affect the 400,000 @entity30 who have homes in @entity3			1
one @entity127 source said : ‘ we do n’t yet know how much money a @entity30 citizen would be expected to have in their bank in order to qualify			2
it is all a bit unclear			0
frankly , we think the @entity3 could have handled this a little better			2
’ last night @entity19 mp @entity136 said he had written to immigration minister @entity137 to ask if the @entity138 had the power to impose similar measures			0
‘ @entity3 ’s decision to insist on medical insurance is a key idea – and if introduced by us could reduce the burden on our services , ’ he said			2
‘ the fact that the @entity64 says these powers are already available to us suggests our failure to enforce them should be taken as an indictment of the mandarin class			0
’ another @entity19 mp , @entity136 , said : ‘ this move drives a coach and horses through the freedom of movement principle and we should take inspiration from it			0
’ @entity3 is in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the @entity163 and is almost certain to require a bailout in the coming weeks			2
official figures released on friday show that unemployment has soared to a record 5.7 million – a staggering 24.6 per cent of the workforce			0
the centre - right government of prime minister @entity169 has introduced the new controls in an attempt to cut expenditure on health and social services			0
health minister @entity175 said recently that 700,000 foreigners had moved to @entity3 just to obtain free health care			2
the country has become a favourite destination for ‘ health tourists ’ from other @entity9 countries , attracted by short waiting lists , cheap treatment and excellent hospitals			2
under @entity9 law , citizens of member states are entitled to receive health care in any member country			1
but @entity3 authorities say their finances are being drained by the arrangement , with local media claiming @entity30 are the worst offenders			1
in contrast to the @entity3 regulations , @entity9 citizens coming to live in @entity30 do not need to register or take out health insurance			1
and the only requirement on those not in work is that they should not become an ‘ unreasonable burden ’ on public funds			0
a spokesman for the @entity203 in @entity204 said : ‘ you either must hold a job or have the means to support yourself to ensure that you do not become a burden on the @entity3 state			1
‘ those people who do not hold a job would have to show that they have contracted a medical insurance service to cover them during their stay in @entity3 , and also that they have the appropriate means to support themselves and any other member of their families			1
pensioners do not need medical insurance			0
’ a @entity127 spokesman said : ‘ this change simply brings @entity3 in line with many other @entity9 countries			1
the @entity30 @entity203 has issued guidance in @entity224 for @entity30 expatriates in @entity3 via its website			1
we understand the new rules will affect a relatively small number of expatriates			0
’ a @entity231 spokesman said : ‘ @entity9 nationals who want to stay in the @entity30 for more than three months must have proof they are working , studying or are self - sufficient			1
‘ wherever we encounter someone breaking the rules , we will take steps to remove them			0
’ @entity30 holidaymakers would have borrowing limits on their credit cards lifted by the government if they were caught up in the collapse of the euro , under new plans			0
the move is one of a series of measures being considered by crisis - management teams in @entity249 , the @entity127 and the @entity250 following advice that @entity253 ’s exit from the single currency is ‘ near inevitable ’ – and could come before the end of the summer - holiday season			0
the deepening economic malaise on the @entity257 has led to the conclusion at the top of the government that there will soon be an ‘ orderly ejection ’ of @entity253 from the euro – probably with only a few days ’ notice			0
if this ‘ @entity267 ’ occurred in the height of the summer season , hundreds of thousands of @entity30 tourists could be stranded with euros that are no longer legal tender			2
cash machines could freeze and credit - card companies are unlikely to process transactions			0
the @entity30 @entity138 ’s primary aim would be to avoid panic by allowing @entity30 tourists to remain in @entity253 until the end of their holiday			1
proposed measures include offering taxpayer - backed guarantees to credit - card companies , enabling tourists to use the cards without borrowing limits			0
the companies would then be compensated for any losses			0
euros could also be exchanged for @entity285 on their return , with the @entity30 taxpayer again bearing the burden			2
a @entity127 source said : ‘ we will have a key role to play in making sense of a confusing situation			0

@entity27 hopes to save more than € 1 billion euros a year
@entity9 citizens living in @entity3 will have to produce job contract
