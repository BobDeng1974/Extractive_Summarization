@entity0 tore into his @entity2 players after their @entity4 hopes were blown to pieces by @entity7 ’s @entity6			1
the @entity9 champions now require a miracle at @entity11 next week if they are to stay in @entity13 ’s premier competition following an abysmal performance which saw @entity15 dismissed on the stroke of half - time			1
after @entity18 gave @entity2 an early lead , two goals from @entity21 and one apiece from @entity22 and @entity23 saw @entity24 shoot down the visitors - and remarkably the scoreline could have been even worse had @entity27 not missed a penalty and had a second one saved by @entity29			1
humiliated : @entity2 's players trudge off the pitch after they were comfortably beaten on wednesday night with @entity2 needing a 3 - 0 win in the unfamiliar surroundings of the national rugby stadium , furious fans will be questioning the logic of handing over @entity37 over for the opening ceremony of the @entity39			1
angered by a ‘ poor ’ display and ‘ stupid mistakes ’ , @entity0 said : ‘ it was a very poor performance and worst of all was the commitment , the energy			1
i need much more energy in the game			2
we did n’t stay together for 90 minutes			2
‘ we started well and got the first goal but then gave way to pressure and lost our heads			2
we started giving the ball way in midfield so many times and mistakes in the back four , some were high , some were low , instead of being together			2
‘ but what is done is done , we have to learn from this very quick			2
we got the away goal and we still have a chance			0
pandemonium : @entity24 's players go wild after @entity21 scores his first goal ‘ it is possible to win 3 - 0 again - like we did last year in the play - off - and with the help of the supporters we will do everything we can to do that			1
‘ but we have to learn from this week			0
we need a whole different attitude and discipline in our play			0
’ the @entity72 did not excuse himself from blame and vowed to make himself clearer in his instructions ahead of the second leg , insisting his team should not have gone on the offensive after @entity21 put the @entity6 in front just before half time			0
‘ it was not the plan to go forward at 2 - 1			1
we had a spell when we had good control but started making stupid mistakes and they got space behind us			0
@entity88 to climb : @entity0 must somehow inspire @entity2 to overcome the three - goal deficit ‘ that is my responsibility			1
i have to be much clearer as to what i expect and how we perform as a team , defensively and offensively , and tonight we lost our heads and that is not good enough			0
’ @entity0 was not too harsh on @entity15 whose defending was ropey before he was sent off for a ‘ last man ’ challenge on @entity96			1
‘ it is not only that situation , it was a consequence of many situations			0
we lost the ball too much in middle , the back four was not together and when we lost the ball we were too open			0
‘ we made it difficult for ourselves and in the end they got a counter-attack and @entity109 went in , but it was a more of a consequence of bad defending			0
’ long journey home : @entity2 fans will not be please with what they saw from their side @entity24 boss @entity7 was delighted by the way his side kept going despite missing two penalties			1
‘ we did n’t feel sorry for ourselves , we pushed and got more goals and we could have scored more , ’ said the former @entity120 player			0
‘ it is not normal to miss two penalties , especially for @entity27 as he has never missed for me			0
@entity125 was confident but that is football			0
but i am very happy with the way we played and so happy for my players to show what we can do in a game like this			1

@entity2 beaten 4 - 1 by @entity24 in @entity4 *qualifier*
@entity0 's side must win 3 - 0 to *progress* to next round
