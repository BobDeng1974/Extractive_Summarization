' by the time he was in the grind of the fourth set , @entity5 was talking directly to a fan who was bothering him , turning toward the @entity42 stands and saying : ' shut up , man ! seriously , shut up			1

@entity9 finally earned his first break point of the match in the fourth game of the third set			1
he converted the chance on a 10 - stroke exchange , stumbling as he flubbed a shot that clipped a net cord , then righting himself to deliver a backhand lob winner that landed on the baseline for a 3 - 1 lead that helped him take that set			1
@entity5 called that ' one bad game			2
' @entity78 : @entity9 returns the ball between his legs during the second round match and then , making things really interesting , @entity9 went up a break at 2 - 1 in the fourth set			1
