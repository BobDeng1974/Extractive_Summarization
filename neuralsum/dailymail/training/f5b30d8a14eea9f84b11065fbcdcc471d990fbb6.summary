' i intend to have a word with him , ' said @entity0 , ahead of saturday 's @entity16 trip to @entity31			2
' he 's an important player			0
' in terms of finding himself at perhaps the biggest club in the world bar one or two , and not getting an opportunity and having to come back to his former club - i think that 's difficult			1
@entity7 signed for @entity3 for £ 15m in 2012 , but failed to hold down a regular starting place ' mentally i think that 's difficult for a young player			1
' so i feel sorry for him , a little bit			0
' and i 'll do my best to raise his profile and spirit for us , and for @entity3 because i 'm sure they 've got one eye on him hopefully still to be a success for them			1

' if you come in and do well you 'll stay in the team , ' he said			0
' i really could not care less of the value you put at your name , or your stature with the chairman , or your following in the crowd			0
' i pick a team i think will win at @entity5 , and one that hopefully will beat @entity75			0
' and everyone gets an even chance			0
' but if everyone does the job asked of them , if they are asked to defend or to create and hurt the opposition , and if they do what they 've been asked , then they 'll stay in the team			0
' and all those players are on an even keel with me			0
' palace forward @entity14 celebrates after scoring the winner against @entity17 last weekend @entity11 and @entity5 are both locked on 20 points after 21 @entity16 games , with @entity0 forced to admit the @entity1 face a relegation six - pointer this weekend			1
' i think it 's a very important game for both clubs , ' said @entity0			0
' i do n't like using those terms ( six - pointer ) , but even so it 's significant in terms of league position , especially if you manage to win			2
' this is a different challenge from @entity17			2
@entity5 are not @entity17 and you need to have a team that can cope with that			2
' so it 's a different test and i 'll find out more after @entity5 about what we have in the squad			0
