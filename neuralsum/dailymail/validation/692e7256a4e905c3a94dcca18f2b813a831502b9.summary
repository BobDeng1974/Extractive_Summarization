dressed in jumpsuits , hands in cuffs , or locked away in tiny cells , these are the youths held by @entity6 's juvenile justice system			0
the emotional portraits , taken at three ' school ' facilities around @entity10 , show the inmates standing in prison corridors and resting in their rooms - as well as others which simply try to show how they are feeling			1
all of the subjects have been locked away after sentencing in the state 's juvenile courts , and are part of a project by photographer @entity21			1
incarcerated : the photo series shows inmates held in @entity10 's juvenile prison system , such as the two men above @entity26 : one inmate is pictured above in his room , which features a combination toilet - sink , which seemingly leaks bleak surroundings : photographer @entity21 visited three school - cum - prison facilities in the state , and photographed inmates and their surroundings cuffed : these two prisoners have their wrists and ankles bound in the uncompromising portrait above however , while @entity21 , whose images are due to be published in an upcoming book , focused on the prisoners ' human side for his series , he deliberately left out one aspect : their pasts			1
each portrait has been left without a label identifying the prisoner , in an attempt to break the link between those depicted and their crimes			2
he also shows their bleak living conditions , from a stark gym to a deserted exercise yard , to uncomfortable - looking standard - issue single beds			2
marketing material for @entity21 's book says the intention is that ' the viewer must draw conclusions about each person â€™s past and possible future ... from the simultaneously vast and limited information in each photograph '			1
@entity21 , who took the photographs between 1997 and 2005 , met the subjects through his work as a resident artist in three of @entity10 's detention centers , which double as schools			1
obscure : @entity21 made the deliberate decision not to mention the crimes which led to the youths being locked away no home comforts : the images show bare sleeping , social and exercise space inside the prison system prison system : state officials say the juvenile detention centers are a last resort for dangerous youths or those who have no responded to other measures around 750 youths a year are sent to juvenile detention facilities in @entity10			1
state information on the system says those sent there have often committed violent crimes or ignored previous punishments			2
information from the overseeing @entity100 and @entity101 department says : ' these youngsters are typically serious and violent offenders or youth with extensive offense histories who have not responded to local sanctions and interventions			0
' children as young as 12 can be incarcerated , and can stay in the facilities until they are 20			0
more than 90 per cent are male			0
according to data from september 2014 , around two thirds are aged 16 - 18			0
some 19 per cent are sex offenders , while 54 per cent have been convicted of violent crimes			0
robbery , assault , burglary and rape feature prominently among the convictions which led to their incarcerations			0
around half have mental health issues			0
judgement ? @entity21 intended his views to draw their own conclusions from the pictures @entity126 dunk : this basketball hoop , surrounded by high walls and barbed wire , is an example of the bleak leisure facilities on offer			1

photographer @entity21 spent years in @entity10 prison - schools taking photographs of inmates
he decided not to link pictures of the young prisoners to their crimes so viewers can ' draw their own conclusions '
