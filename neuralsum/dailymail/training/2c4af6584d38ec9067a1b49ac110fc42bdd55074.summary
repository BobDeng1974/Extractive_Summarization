perhaps not surprisingly considering his name , @entity1 striker @entity0 has been mistaken for a foreigner on occasion			1
‘ when people meet me , they seem to speak a little bit slower and then they realise i ’m as @entity12 as they come , ’ says @entity5 - born @entity0 , who has never set foot in @entity7 despite his heritage			2
then there ’s team - mate @entity14 , whose qualification for his @entity17 under 20 cap starts and ends with his paternal grandmother having been born there			2
@entity1 manager @entity20 shouts instructions to his players at @entity23 on saturday @entity1 players celebrate after scoring against @entity25 in the @entity27 clash on saturday @entity28 @entity29 @entity30 @entity31 @entity32 @entity33 @entity34 @entity35 @entity36 @entity37 @entity14 in fact , take away reserve goalkeeper @entity39 — @entity7 - born and @entity40 - bred — and there is n’t a single foreigner on the books at @entity44			1
in the last three games , @entity1 have become the first @entity27 club since @entity47 in 2011 to field a starting @entity48 made up entirely of players born in @entity50			1
until now , @entity52 - born defender @entity51 and @entity53 international @entity54 were the only exceptions			0
that will be music to the ears of @entity60 chairman @entity59 who has made it his mission to increase the number of home - grown players in a league that has thrived from attracting some of the top talent in world football			2
the feeling around @entity1 is that it might even be the key to @entity20 ’s team surviving in the top flight this season			1
@entity74 's @entity14 shoots towards goal and scores in the 2 - 1 defeat by @entity25 @entity1 's @entity0 looks to shoot during the @entity27 match against @entity79 last month ‘ we love it , ’ said midfielder @entity33			1
‘ you get that grit from the @entity50 players , they all want to work hard			1
it ’s a big factor for us as a club , we all put a shift in			0
‘ it ’s that working - class attitude			0
it ’s instilled in you , especially being from @entity50 , that you need to work hard to get anything in life			2
we ’re highest on the work - rate stats and distance covered , and that ’s something we pride ourselves on			0
you do n’t always need to go foreign to do well in the @entity27			1
’ @entity1 ’s track record of signing foreign players down the years is patchy at best			1
for every @entity101 , @entity99 or @entity100 , there are more than a few who did n’t work out			0
supporters still wince at the mere mention of @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107			0
@entity108 , the nephew of @entity111 ’s @entity110 winner @entity112 , also disappeared after his only game in 1997			0
@entity1 's @entity33 advances with the ball during the match against @entity25 at @entity23 @entity1 goalkeeper @entity101 looks dejected during a @entity27 match against @entity117 in 2010 @entity118 , @entity1 ’s last foreigner who was signed by @entity119 in 2012 , made his league debut under @entity20 as a substitute against @entity122 and was then substituted himself 45 minutes later			1
the @entity124 international did not play for the club again			0
despite @entity1 ’s reliance on @entity50 - born players , @entity20 insists there is no club policy against buying foreigners			1
he argues that the lack of a @entity133 scouting network has made it difficult for @entity1 to compete with the bigger clubs , although that could change after former @entity136 and @entity138 scout @entity137 was appointed last month to oversee the international operation			2
@entity1 's @entity107 ( centre ) in action during the @entity143 third round match against @entity144 in 2009 @entity20 ( left ) and @entity37 celebrate after @entity1 win promotion from the @entity146 last season ‘ there ’s a lot made about it but , as a manager , you ’re not really bothered where players come from , ’ said @entity20			1
‘ you see beyond all the cultures , colours , and creeds			0
you want good footballers and i ’m no different			0
‘ plenty of teams are doing well without a core of @entity50 players , and if players become available who are not from these shores then we ’ll certainly look at that			2
’ he added : ‘ there are a lot of fans out there who like our journey			0
loads of people say , “ we think it ’s great and we want you to stay up ”			0
there ’s a story beyond the story , which is a smaller club developing players without major resources , @entity50 or not			1
the thing is , they like the story			0
