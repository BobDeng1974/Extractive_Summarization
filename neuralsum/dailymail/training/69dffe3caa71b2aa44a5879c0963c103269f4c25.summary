' they said they are going to do all sorts of nasty things to us			2
we have even had death threats			2
' ' he has given it to the club			1
he could n't give it to us directly as the gates were locked so he put it as close as he could			2
' he has done it to help the right people			2
i was approached by somebody who knows @entity2 very well			2
he 's an artist himself and he said ' you need to take that @entity56 , get it into that club - it 's what it is meant for			1
just hours after it was spotted it was removed from the wall using a crow bar by members of the nearby @entity13 and @entity14 who are now charging people to come and see it the financially struggling youth group - who insist @entity2 wanted them to have it - plan to sell the work to fund the future of the club , and hope to bring in £ 100,000 a notice where @entity99 once stood , directs people to the youth group if they want to view the work for a small donation ' @entity2 never does his street art on pieces of wood - they are always on walls so they ca n't be taken away			1
' we need £ 120,000 to keep going and our fundraising appeal has so far only brought a few thousand pounds			1
' now we 've ended up with a @entity2 on our doorstep			2
it is a dream come true			2

it will stand us in good stead for the next 120 years			0
' a screen print of @entity99 has been pasted on top of the boarded up doorway in place of the original the @entity13 and @entity14 defended the decision to remove the @entity2 and sell it			1
left the gate seen in the @entity1 and right the artwork on the wall visitors today were advised they did not need to donate to the club but many insisted it was what they wanted to do @entity151 said they were not ' 100 per cent sure of the ownership ' of the wall the artwork was attached to			1
but today all that was left where it stood was a sign which said : ' the new @entity2 piece is being held in our club to prevent any vandalism or damage being done			1
' you are free to come and view but a small donation will be asked of you			0
' teenagers at @entity13 and @entity14 defended the decision to remove the @entity2 and sell it			1
@entity169 , 19 , has been attending the project for 11 years - the last two as a youth worker			1
the teenager , who helped remove the art work , said : ' it is a really good atmosphere here , with lots of activities to do and loads of people to speak to			1
' if we had n't brought it in it would have been taken by someone else and sold privately and then nobody would have seen it then			0
' visitors today were advised they did not need to donate to the club but many insisted it was what they wanted to do			1
engineer @entity190 , 52 , of @entity4 said : ' i do n't mind at all , i think it was a sensible thing to do			0
' it can make money for a good cause			0
i would suggest it was the right thing to do			0
' mr @entity190 's mother , @entity197 , 90 , agreed			0
' i enjoyed seeing it , it was very good , ' she added			0
@entity201 , director of the @entity202 , the first art gallery in @entity4 , described the piece as ' brilliant '			0
' i think that the fact it was screwed on to a wall makes it extremely portable and would have increased the likelihood of someone taking it			1
' from my point of view , the fact it has come to an organisation like this , that is supporting the local community is better than it going straight to some wealthy collector			0
' mr @entity218 added that @entity151 , who he believes own the wall , do not like graffiti and would probably have painted over the piece			1
a spokeswoman for @entity224 said officers were not investigating the removal of the artwork			0
the @entity2 that appeared on the side of a house on sunday in @entity230 , @entity231 ' we have not received any reports of a criminal offence , ' she said			0
however , a police officer and a @entity237 visited the centre today and advised the youth club to seek legal advice before selling the piece			1
this latest artwork in @entity243 comes just days after a mother - of - five woke up to find a @entity2 mural on the side of her rented house on sunday			1
stunned @entity249 , 48 , heard voices outside in the early hours but thought nothing of it until she spotted men loading huge screens into a van			0
she watched them zoom off before finding a painting of three 1950s - style spies on the side of her £ 300,000 three - bed semi in @entity230 , @entity231			1
the men in the picture are carrying listening devices and crowded around a real phone box outside her home			0
mystery man : @entity2 appears in his 2011 film @entity270 he 's the @entity271 of modern art and his true identity remains a jealously guarded secret			0
a network of myths has grown up around him			0
that his real name is @entity278			0
that he used to be a butcher			0
that his parents do n't know what he does , believing him to be an unusually successful painter and decorator			0
then there 's the suggestion that @entity2 is actually a collective of artists and does n't exist at all			0
@entity2 's refusal to reveal himself may have started simply to avoid prosecution for what could be described as acts of vandalism			0
however by remaining anonymous he has created an air of mystery which has helped him to become one of the most successful artists of his generation			1
he has been photographed in the past but always wearing a mask or hood			0
in 2008 he was reportedly ' unmasked ' as @entity299 , a former public schoolboy from @entity4 with a passion for art. at the time @entity2 's agent refused to confirm or deny the story			0
@entity2 then wrote on his website : ' i am unable to comment on who may or may not be @entity2 , but anyone described as being ' good at drawing ' does n't sound like @entity2 to me			0
' fans had hoped he would finally reveal himself in his spoof 2010 grafitti film @entity270 - he did appear in the film however he was heavily pixellated			2
this photograph apparently shows reclusive graffiti artist @entity2 in @entity314 in 2011 past ' @entity316 sightings ' include :			0
