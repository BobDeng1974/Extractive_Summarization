a referendum on @entity2 leaving the @entity3 would go ahead even if the @entity4 are forced to enter a second coalition with the @entity6 , it emerged today			1
senior @entity6 indicated that they would not block @entity8 's promise of an in - out vote by 2017 , with @entity10 saying he would ' relish ' the battle to stay in the @entity3			1
but splits emerged at the party 's conference in @entity15 , as @entity16 insisted the referendum promised by the @entity4 is ' just not on offer as far as we are concerned '			1
treasury minister @entity20 signalled he would be open to negotiating a referendum with the @entity4 in the event of another hung parliament mr @entity8 has promised to renegotiate a new deal with the @entity3 , clawing back powers from @entity26 , before holding an in - out referendum in 2017			1
under pressure from @entity29 , mr @entity8 has made clear he will not argue for @entity2 to remain in the @entity3 if it is not in the national interest			1
at last week 's @entity32 conference , mr @entity8 said : ' we 're going to go in as a country , get our powers back , fight for our national interest			1
' and yes – we 'll put it to a referendum , in or out – it will be your choice , and let the message go out from this hall : it is only with a conservative @entity44 that you will get that choice			0
' the @entity6 had argued that there was no need to have a referendum unless more powers are transferred to @entity26 – something which few expect to happen			1
however , at the @entity6 conference in @entity15 , mr @entity10 and his closest ally @entity20 signalled that a referendum would not be a deal - breaker for a second coalition with the @entity4			1
mr @entity20 , the chief treasury secretary , told a meeting on the fringe of the conference : ' clearly , we 'd have to be able to come to an agreement which was satisfactory to both parties			2
' and pressed further on the issue later , mr @entity20 did not rule out talking to @entity4 about a referendum			1
' we certainly have n't engaged in any discussions with any other party about what might happen after the election , ' mr @entity20 said			2
' we will certainly make the case in terms of what our priorities are and it will be up to the @entity2 people to decide which party has the strongest mandate			2
of course , we would engage in conversations with them if that were to happen			0
' i 'm not going to get into trying to pre-negotiate coalition agreements on the result of an election which has n't happened			0
' but business secretary @entity16 insisted the @entity6 would not sign up to the referendum being promised by the @entity4 officically the @entity6 are in favour of a referendum on the @entity3 if ' there is a change in the rules			1
' but mr @entity10 today said he would ' relish ' an in - out referendum			2
he told the @entity91 4 today programme : ' the @entity32 are tearing themselves up about @entity92 so they have now plucked out of thin air an arbitrary date - 2017 - when a referendum would take place			0
' we have in law a guarantee about when a referendum will take place , when the rules of the game change			0
' more than that , i say that the question on the ballot paper should be in or out and i would relish that moment			0
' however , business secretary @entity16 appeared to rule out a deal with @entity4 on an in / out referendum , telling a separate fringe meeting : ' our commitment to the @entity3 is an absolute one ... we have made it clear that the kind of referendum the @entity4 want is just not on offer as far as we are concerned			1
' mr @entity16 also warned that intimidation of @entity118 companies could become a ' serious problem ' if an in / out referendum was staged			0
@entity6 leader @entity10 insisted he would ' relish ' the battle to keep @entity2 in the @entity3 eurosceptic @entity32 ex-minister @entity122 was last week reported to have said that ' out ' campaigners would ' make life difficult ' for businesses which speak out in favour of continued @entity3 membership in ways which would be ' deeply disruptive to their businesses , and maybe even to their own tenure of their jobs '			1
his remarks at last week 's @entity32 conference came after widespread complaints of the bullying of businesses which spoke out against @entity137 independence in the recent referendum campaign			0
mr @entity16 - who described himself as ' not a member of the @entity122 fan club ' - said : ' the intimidation issue ... is potentially a serious problem if we do get to a referendum			2
' i came up to @entity137 during the long campaign and there were a lot of businesses who said they did n't wish to be publicly quoted			0
sometimes it was for perfectly good industrial reasons - they did n't want their labour force , they did n't want their management to be quarrelling			0
they did n't want to alienate their customers , which is understandable			0
' but some of them were frightened that there would be some kind of retribution			0
' if we are getting - hopefully not - a @entity3 referendum , the last thing we need is for companies to be intimidated and prevented from saying what they really think			2

@entity8 wants to claw back powers before in - out vote in 2017
@entity6 argued plans create *uncertainty* and a vote is not needed
but @entity20 signals he would enter into talks with the @entity4
@entity10 says he would ' relish ' the fight to keep @entity2 in the @entity3
but @entity16 insists vote promised by @entity4 is ' just not on offer '
