@entity2 @entity1 , 37 , careered into the packed vehicle as he tailed a car leaving a ' drugs hotspot '			1
however , the officer did not activate the sirens or blue lights on his unmarked car because he did not want to alert the driver of the suspect motor			1
the pc was fined £ 350 after he admitted driving without due care and attention at @entity24			1
he was spared penalty points on his licence after a judge said the case was ' exceptional '			1
@entity28 started the car chase when he noticed the suspect @entity30 leaving the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33 , at around 9pm last march 28			1
the officer , who had only became an advanced police driver last year , had already overtaken the car so went around the roundabout at the junction of @entity39 and @entity40 to get behind the @entity30 so he could check its number plate			2
however as they approached traffic lights westbound less than 25 seconds later , the @entity30 , which had a front headlight out , sped through the green light and as the two officers followed in their unmarked @entity47 , the light turned to red			0
@entity49 said : ' it was going faster than a normal member of the public would travel , and a lot of the local criminals are aware of our unmarked vehicles			0
' i was n't closing the gap significantly enough to be able to get an @entity59 on the number plate			2
' if i 'd have put my two - tone sirens on straight away - if that vehicle had something on board of interest - we would have lost it straight away			2
it was 300 yards in front of us			0
' he added that he felt it necessary to check the number plate before stopping the car in case the three passengers were armed or dangerous , so decided to go through the red light in pursuit			2
@entity49 then tailed the vehicle along into the @entity79 estate along @entity40 and noticed a bus at the junction of @entity82 but presumed it was going straight on			0
high - speed chase : @entity49 's car smashed into a bus at the traffic lights near the junction of @entity39 and @entity40 he said it had then unexpectedly turned right and straight into the path of his car as he went through a red traffic light			2

@entity97 , for @entity1 , said : ' he simply misjudged the position of the bus and accepts he made a mistake			1
' none of the 25 passengers or the driver of the bus was injured in the crash , which caused severe damage to the police car			0
district judge @entity108 said the incident had exceptional circumstances and @entity49 had made the right decision not to use his flashing lights or sirens			1
he added : ' this vehicle was being driven with only one headlight functioning and you made the decision , quite rightly in my opinion , to monitor its movements			0
' this case really turns on one decision you made			0
it 's a decision you made to drive through the red signal			0
it 's as simple as that			0
' i do say that this is one of those rare cases where i 'm satisfied that it 's not appropriate to endorse your licence			1
' @entity49 , from @entity133 , @entity134 , admitted driving without due care and attention			0
