another examination with a positive outcome			0
this , though , was possibly @entity5 ’s most valuable result yet			1
he clinched the title last year away to the @entity7 , but that was with a settled side going full tilt at the end of a campaign			0
here , going in with rust in the names of @entity15 and @entity16 , he ’d gambled on quality ahead of game time and the ambitious punt ultimately paid dividend , @entity21 taking a deserved victory despite late @entity7 desperation			1
@entity15 gets treatment on the pitch following his collision with @entity27 @entity21 fly - half @entity15 was in the wars again after 12 - week concussion lay - off the visitors ate into an 18 - 6 deficit with @entity33 ’s 71st minute try just seconds before @entity35 ’s sin - binning expired , and they then launched a cavalry charge			1
however , faced with determined @entity39 resistance , they did n’t have the nous to unlock teak home defending and a seven - point margin was just about right			0
you could accuse @entity21 of winning ugly as @entity44 won the try count 1 - 0 , but that would be a disservice to their effort in a troublesome quarrel where it took time for @entity15 and @entity16 to get up to speed after their respective long lay - offs			1
that both played a significant leadership role in helping @entity21 see out their end - game reflected well on @entity5 ’s pluck to select them , and he was be even more pleased that his out - half walked off with only a bit of blood spilt following some head - punishing collisions with @entity27			1
blood seeps from a cut on the head of @entity21 's lock @entity66 ( right ) @entity21 's flanker @entity67 ( left ) is tackled by @entity44 's flanker @entity68 @entity70 in the tackle , @entity15 varied his kicking game smartly , shepherding his pack around in a contest they initially appeared they could win in a flourish			1
however a 12 - 6 interval lead was only increased by a further six points , @entity77 spilling the ball forward just when it appeared @entity15 had given him the try - scoring assist			1
despite the shortage of tries and the crazily high penalty count of 25 , this was a clash that had much more going for it than the lack of entertainment both sides were guilty of in round one			0
its pattern somewhat mirrored the november @entity39 win over @entity95 given how tight it was coming down the home straight			0
in the end , it concluded with @entity44 running out of ideas and width , @entity101 clasping hold of @entity103 out wide near the 22 and @entity16 arriving in forager ’s fashion to help bundle the @entity7 ball carrier into touch			0
cue sigh of @entity39 relief all round , followed by well - earned smiles			0
@entity44 's flanker @entity111 ( left ) passes the ball back to @entity44 's @entity113 @entity44 's @entity114 runs at @entity66 of @entity21 at @entity115 with conditions perfect , @entity21 demonstrated more initiative on their kick - off receipt than they did throughout most of last weekend ’s low quality spectacle in @entity120 , putting the ball through the hands from one side of the 22 to the other before punting clear			1
thirteen minutes had passed by the time they hit the front , @entity15 scoring a penalty from the left of the 22 despite an initial tactical kicking duel giving way to some scrum worries			2
retribution by @entity133 on a @entity7 feed left @entity15 kicking to inside the 22 and it brought a shot at the posts off the ensuing maul			2
@entity139 was , @entity21 quickly conceded at the ruck , @entity114 tying it up , but they were given an easy invite to retake the lead			2
@entity15 ’s restarting kick hung lovely for @entity144 to flap back and the fast - maturing @entity145 to gather			1
@entity146 was penalised for loitering on the wrong side of the ruck			0
@entity44 's @entity148 is shown a yellow card for a knee in the back of @entity152 during a ruck if 6 - 3 at the end of the first quarter was encouraging , what followed for the next 10 minutes was exasperating			2
twice @entity21 conceded penalties at the ruck for not releasing inside the @entity7 22			2
then on another raid , ball carried by @entity145 was softly stolen at the breakdown by @entity27 , resulting in @entity44 having a lineout in the @entity39 22 once @entity161 erred at a halfway ruck			0
the hosts craftily opted not to engage at the @entity7 maul and the visitors were penalised for crossing just as they thought they were going in for a try			0
relieved , @entity21 upped the tempo at the ruck and a ruck penalty saw @entity15 land his third kick , this time from the 10 - metre line with seven minutes to go to the break			1
@entity15 celebrates after the final whistle at @entity115 on saturday @entity7 players ca n't hide their disappointment after saturday 's defeat in @entity176 @entity177 quickly nailed a penalty in reply , but @entity5 ’s side finished the half six points clear , @entity144 again excellent under @entity15 ’s restart as he tackled @entity183 to touch			1
@entity145 , @entity184 and @entity152 all had charges off the following lineout possession , with @entity145 ’s second gallop forcing – yes , you guessed it – another ruck penalty			0
@entity21 pressed hard after the interval , temporary replacement @entity192 landing a 51st minute penalty			2
then came @entity148 ’s yellow for kneeing @entity152 , but @entity21 failed to score in the eight minutes they held a man advantage before @entity35 saw yellow			0
the champions managed well for a time , @entity15 scoring on 68 minutes after @entity183 strayed offside , but @entity200 ’s unconverted try set up a grandstand finish after a terrible @entity177 penalty miss while @entity35 was off			1
nails were bitten , but @entity21 had the bluster to hold on			0

@entity15 fired 15 points in @entity21 's ninth consecutive victory
the @entity21 fly - half was making his return from a 12 - week concussion lay - off
@entity5 's men set up a *potential* @entity216 title *decider* with @entity205 on march 1
