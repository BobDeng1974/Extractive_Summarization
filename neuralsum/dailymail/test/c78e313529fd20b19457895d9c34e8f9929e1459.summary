@entity2 up for the future of golf over its past and present as 21 - year - old @entity0 took the first - day honours with a stunning opening round of 64 on a spectacular day of scoring at the sun - baked 79th masters			1
for much of the day it looked as if he might have to share top billing with 34 - year - old @entity11 and 45 - year - old @entity12 , as the @entity13 and the @entity14 posted scores of 67 to tie @entity16 , an @entity17 representative of the rank and file			1
last man out @entity21 would join them in the evening shadows			1
but by then @entity0 had separated himself from the field to become the youngest first - round leader in @entity27 history with a fabulous run of six birdies in seven holes before adding a wonderful flourish at the 18th , where he brushed in a 25 - foot birdie putt			1
runner - up on his debut last year , he now owns a three - shot lead going into day two			1
@entity0 sinks his birdie put on the 18th at @entity39 to take a three - shot lead into the second round @entity11 made the early running with an impressive five - under - par 67 @entity44 consoles @entity45 after the amateur finished his round on 13 over most of the favoured names left @entity50 feeling reasonably content , as @entity51 and defending champion @entity52 shot 71 , while @entity53 and masters specialist @entity54 opened with rounds of 70			1
whether they will be feeling quite so content at falling so far behind such an awesome talent as the brilliant @entity57 is another matter			0
@entity0 has barely been off a leader - board all year and there was no chance of him being off this one during this round where he hit flagsticks , holed putts from everywhere and enjoyed the requisite amount of fortune as well as a wayward drive at the 13th bounced off the @entity70 pines into the middle of the fairway			1
it meant when he stood on the par - five 15th tee he was eight under after a scarcely credible 10 single putts on these treacherous greens			2
at that moment anything seemed possible — even a 62 , thereby setting a new standard for scoring in the 155 - year history of majors			1
only once all day did he act his age and it was here on this risk - reward par five , as he ran up a six			2
naturally , @entity0 was not about to get greedy			1
‘ i made a mistake but a 64 , my first score in the sixties on this course , i have nothing to complain about , ’ he said			2
a packed crowd watch @entity44 on the 10th green during the first round @entity44 and @entity16 ( above ) made the early running at @entity39 with a 67 @entity14 @entity12 rolled back the years with a superb 67 on thursday rose in full bloom on day one is a sight as familiar as the glorious azaleas			1
in nine previous starts @entity44 has led on three occasions after the first round			2
here he equalled his best masters score , recorded on the opening day in 2004			2
that year he went on to hold the 36 - hole lead as well , while in 2007 he was lying tied second going into the final round , eventually finishing tied fifth			1
add all those memories of good days here to the fact he ’s now a proven major champion following his @entity111 triumph in 2013 , and there must be the hope this will prove rather more than an excellent opening gambit			0
certainly that is how he is seeing it			0
‘ i ’ve learned plenty from those previous occasions , like not getting ahead of yourself , ’ he said			0
‘ i ’ve learned that the hard way and now i ca n’t see any reason why i should n’t keep executing the gameplan			0
you ’ve got to believe in yourself , especially when you ’re a major winner			0
’ @entity12 used his ball - striking skills to get out of trouble on the 17th hole during the first round @entity51 appeared relaxed as he walked down the ninth fairway with @entity54 , right , @entity51 recovered from a shaky start to finish the first round on one - under - par @entity44 was n’t the only @entity13 to prosper , as in - form @entity132 shot 69			1
‘ i played with @entity132 last week and he strikes me as a man with something to prove , ’ said @entity44			0
after @entity136 , @entity12 might be the great hard - luck story when it comes to fabulous players who never quite got it done here			1
given how good he was at 25 , he represents a cautionary tale for those who believe it inevitable @entity51 will win the @entity27 one day			2
@entity12 is still trying , at 45 , and what a joy to see one of the great ball - strikers roll back a decade or two rather than the years to post his five - under score			1
a wonderful eagle three at the 15th was followed by a superlative sand save from a buried lie at the 17th			0
only at the last was there a modicum of disappointment			0
two putts and it would have been his lowest score in 71 rounds at @entity39			2
@entity51 recovered from a nervously played front nine with some familiar @entity39 failings resurfacing as he failed to birdie either par five			2
two clunked chip shots at the third and sixth also betrayed a level of tension that illustrated fully the momentous nature of the achievement he is trying to complete in shooting for the career grand slam			1
@entity17 @entity0 celebrates with his caddie @entity171 on the 18th defending champion @entity52 struggled to find his rhythm in opening round @entity174 feels the heat with the world no 111 struggling to get under par during the opening round @entity174 reacts to a poor chip shot on the third hole as the pressure begins to tell there were also two encouraging moments during that front nine , however , when he turned what would have been double bogeys in the past into mere bogeys			1
at the par - five second he drove into a hazard and was staring an ugly seven in the face for openers until he got down in two blows from 100 yards			0
at the sixth , his mis - hit chip came back down the steep slope but he did n’t panic			1
he decided to take his putter for the second attempt and got down in two			0
the value of limiting the damage was emphasised further when he notched his first birdie of the day at the next			0
on the back nine , it was more like it from the 25 - year - old			2
over the front nine he had given up three shots on the par fives alone to playing partner @entity54 , but here he got the two birdies on offer at the 13th and the 15th			0
‘ i left myself in some awkward spots but i holed some good putts on the back nine , ’ he said			0
‘ i was a little nervous on the front nine but mostly just too excited			0
it was a decent opener			0
’ the day as a whole was a lot better than that			0
one to savour , in fact .			0
