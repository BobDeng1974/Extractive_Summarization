@entity13 celebrates following her opening minute strike against @entity9 in @entity27 but as 5,665 watched on , @entity5 struggled to build on their early assault on the @entity9 goal			1
@entity30 cut @entity9 's arrears after shaky defending , and might have had an equaliser in the second half but mis - kicked as @entity5 feared the worst			1
@entity15 , a 21 - year - old playing in the second division of the @entity36 , was impressive throughout , a nimble - footed presence who @entity9 struggled to deal with			0

@entity0 ( left ) is congratulated by her @entity5 team - mates after she netted the second goal for his side @entity9 were caught cold when @entity15 dribbled the ball down the left and curved a tremendous ball with the outside of her right boot to @entity13 , who fired past @entity55 for the early opener			1
the architect turned predator to put the hosts 2 - 0 in front in the 10th minute , meeting a right - wing cross from @entity62 with a clever touch on her chest that took out her marker before smashing home from 10 yards			0
just two minutes later the lively @entity16 striker , with 10 goals in her last three club matches , forced @entity55 to push away a 20 - yard drive			2
@entity71 hit the left post after a hopeless kick out from @entity55 , and @entity5 were rampant			0

@entity81 had to save well to turn away a free - kick from @entity84 before the break , with defensive insecurities becoming a worrying feature of @entity5 's game			2
