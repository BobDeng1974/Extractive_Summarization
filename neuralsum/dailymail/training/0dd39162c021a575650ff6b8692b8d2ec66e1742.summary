@entity1 left - back @entity0 will complete a £ 34million transfer to @entity3 in the next 24 hours after arriving at the club 's @entity4 on thursday evening			1
the @entity6 international met @entity3 officials and got a personal tour at @entity10 ahead of a medical on friday morning , and the deal was all but completed while the 18 - year - old made his @entity15 debut in @entity16			1
@entity0 will stay overnight in a @entity18 hotel before visiting @entity19 to be shown around and have promotional photographs taken on friday			0
@entity0 has scheduled his time away to return for @entity3 's tour of @entity38			2
the youngster is understood to have informed @entity1 of his desire to leave the club at the end of may and a wage package in excess of £ 100,000 - per - week has been agreed in principle between @entity3 and the player for some time			1
former @entity19 boss @entity47 laid the groundwork in persuading @entity0 to make the move , as @entity3 overcame interest from @entity51 to secure their man with a superior salary			2
it is understood @entity55 has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead			0
former : @entity0 ( right ) is set to leave @entity58 ( left ) at @entity1 for @entity3 green light : @entity55 has given his blessing for the deal to go ahead to bring in @entity0 @entity3 cooled their interest in recent weeks to ensure @entity0 was focused on the @entity15 but , as @entity63 revealed on monday morning , executive vice-chairman @entity61 intended to accelerate the pursuit once @entity6 returned from @entity16 on wednesday afternoon			1
@entity0 disembarked at @entity65 to see his family before heading up to the @entity67 to become @entity69 's second @entity3 signing , after @entity70 completing his £ 29m transfer to the club on thursday afternoon			1
the fee for @entity0 is somewhat higher than @entity3 initially hoped for , with @entity1 's resistance , @entity0 's involvement in the @entity15 and the arrival of @entity78 manager @entity77 , who has sanctioned the sale			2
@entity0 becomes the second most expensive signing in @entity3 's history , behind january recruit @entity82 , who arrived for a £ 37m fee from @entity51			2
fee : @entity0 's price is somewhat higher than @entity3 had hoped for but they are prepared to fork out the sum @entity0 , a product of @entity1 's highly - acclaimed academy , will compete with @entity89 for the left - back spot after the @entity92 international penned a one - year deal to stay at @entity19			1
speaking after @entity6 's 0 - 0 draw with @entity95 at the @entity15 , @entity0 was asked whether he needed @entity97 football upon his @entity99 return			1
@entity0 said : ' obviously @entity97 would help , playing against world - class players , but you ca n't just say that because you look at other teams that have gone through the groups and they have n't got all @entity97 players			0
' i do n't know			0
i think we 'll have a look at it and just to try and move on in the coming few months			0
' thanks : @entity0 throws a boot into the crowd after @entity6 drew 0 - 0 with @entity95 at the @entity15 the proposed move comes after @entity3 legend @entity112 warned £ 34million for @entity0 would be too much			1
@entity112 thinks that kind of money could be better spent on a striker who would guarantee @entity55 at least 30 goals a season			0
' the proposed £ 34m transfer for the 18 - year - old @entity0 to @entity3 is another example of something which has a bad long - term impact , ' he said			2
' clubs are priced out of this market which is why they go abroad for cheap options - they ’re not better players			0
' for a left - back to be worth £ 34m shows how silly the game has gone			1
for that money i want a centre - forward who ’s going to score 30 goals a season			0
' @entity0 , who turns 19 in july , already has 60 appearances in the @entity99 and three @entity6 caps to his name			0
it comes with @entity137 set to leave @entity3 for @entity138 , while @entity139 and @entity140 already left after a lack - luster season			0
leap : @entity0 can have a medical at @entity19 , but @entity112 thinks the price tag is too much history : @entity145 at £ 27m was the most expensive teenager but @entity0 could best the @entity3 striker			1

@entity0 deal was all but done while left - back was at @entity15
@entity112 says £ 34million price - tag shows ' how silly the game has gone '
@entity3 *originally* bid £ 27m with £ 100,000 - per - week offer in may
@entity156 's @entity70 *joined* @entity55 for £ 29m
@entity0 , 18 , made @entity6 @entity15 debut in @entity16 against @entity95
