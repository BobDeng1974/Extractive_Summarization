a @entity6 man who was filming his girlfriend in the ski resort of @entity19 has come forward to say the footage includes the moment @entity11 crashed on the slopes			1
detectives in @entity24 were last night trying to get a copy of the smartphone video after the man , who has not been named , went to @entity6 news journal @entity5			1
@entity29 legend @entity11 , 45 , who is still in a critical condition in an induced coma , was apparently skiing at just 12mph when he hit a rock under the snow			1
@entity5 said : ‘ the man , a 35 - year - old flight attendant from @entity35 , was just a few metres from the accident site on the slopes and was filming his girlfriend			1
‘ in the background of the film , slightly blurred , a skier can be seen in the unprepared part between the two slopes sliding over the snow			1
‘ according to the man , who contacted @entity5 on friday , the skier was @entity11			1
he is believed to have slowed down to a speed of up to 20kph			2
’ police will tomorrow check footage from a tiny digital camera @entity11 wore on his helmet , after his family handed it over			2
the statement corroborates claims made by @entity11 ’s spokeswoman @entity55			2
earlier this week she denied @entity11 had been speeding after allegations were made that he was doing at least 60km/h			0
she said : ' i think after having spoken with several people who have been with @entity11 at this moment , @entity11 and the group have been skiing on slopes that were normal slopes			2
' then there is a blue slope and a red slope , and in between there was a part which was deep snow , and @entity11 went into that			0
family support : yesterday @entity11 's father , @entity70 , and brother , @entity72 , were seen outside @entity73 where he remains in an induced coma ' from everything the people told me , he was not even at high speed , because it seems that he even helped a friend who just had fallen on the piste			1
' so he started to ski again , went into this deep snow , and apparently , this is what we guess , has hit a rock which he had not seen when he wanted to do a curve , and he was kind of catapulted into the air and apparently , head down , hitting another rock			0
' which was extreme bad and unfortunate circumstance , and not because he was speeding too much			0
i have spoken with several people , and also ski teachers , and they tell me it can even happen at 10km/h			0
it is just very , very unfortunate			0
' @entity11 has been in a critical condition in intensive care since his accident in the @entity24 ski resort of @entity19 a week last sunday			1
his family has handed police the @entity100 camera he wore on his skiing helmet at the time of his accident			1
