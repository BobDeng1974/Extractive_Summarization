by @entity0 @entity2 's international future is in doubt after he was overlooked for a central contract by @entity6 ’s selectors despite opening the batting in all seven tests this summer			1
the 25 - year - old @entity10 batsman was the most notable omission on thursday from a group of a dozen players handed lucrative 12 - month @entity15 deals , which also included wicketkeeper @entity16 ahead of @entity17 , who is recovering from achilles tendon surgery			2
batsman @entity2 hit 127 against @entity20 in june and played all of @entity6 's tests this summer @entity23 has impressed with bat and ball during 10 appearances for @entity6 this season @entity28 contracts : @entity23 , @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity16 , @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38			1
incremental contracts : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44			0
with @entity47 sacked , @entity46 retired and @entity48 still not considered ready for a recall after returning from last winter ’s ashes with a stress - related illness , there was the air of a new era surrounding the squad , with six players handed contracts for the first time			1
all - rounder @entity59 is the other player not retained , with @entity23 , @entity30 , @entity35 , @entity37 and @entity38 all joining @entity16 in receiving their first full - time contracts			1
‘ the awarding of contracts enables the selectors and team management to plan for the next 12 months of international cricket , ’ national selector @entity62 said			0
‘ we have been hugely encouraged by the rapid development of a host of younger players in the last year , and this is reflected in six players being awarded 12 - month central contracts for the first time			1
’ @entity30 celebrates a test century against @entity73 in july and has now been awarded a central contract @entity77 's @entity59 , here in bat , has not been retained on a central contract by the @entity15 but it is @entity2 ’s omission that will raise most eyebrows , leaving more questions over who will open alongside captain @entity33 during next summer ’s ashes			1
@entity85 - born @entity2 was given the summer to prove he should be the man entrusted with the second opener ’s position			2
@entity88 , @entity89 and @entity36 have also been tried alongside @entity33 but none has been able to make the position their own			0
hopes were high @entity2 could fill the role when he scored 127 in his second test against @entity20 in june , and 59 in the first @entity73 test			0
his form has dipped alarmingly , though , and there is now a chance for @entity101 opener @entity41 to stake a claim for a test place if he impresses during the @entity104 this winter			0
@entity41 is one of five players given an incremental contract along with @entity40 , @entity42 , @entity43 and @entity44			0
@entity48 is rebuilding his form at @entity107 but has not been retained on central contract by the @entity15 .			2

@entity23 , @entity30 , @entity16 , @entity35 , @entity37 and @entity38 sign central contracts for the first time
@entity2 not chosen but played all of @entity6 's tests this summer
five players lose central status including @entity59 and @entity48
