@entity0 has warned @entity1 he will have to fight for his place at @entity3 following his dramatic deadline day move			1
@entity1 ’s £ 6million loan from @entity7 could become a permanent transfer worth £ 52m if the @entity10 striker proves to be a success at @entity12 , where he will earn £ 280,000 a week			1
but despite the departures of @entity15 and @entity16 on monday , @entity13 believes @entity1 still faces plenty of competition			1
‘ at a top club you should always go for the best , which also fits my philosophy			1
‘ @entity1 must fight for his place , as i also have to			1
we must battle with @entity35 and @entity36 to see who is playing			2
’ @entity1 is in @entity38 , where @entity10 play @entity39 in a friendly on friday night , and he is hoping to secure a work permit in time to be available against @entity42 a week on sunday			1
his father revealed yesterday that @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 were among the clubs who showed an interest in the 28 - year - old			2
@entity51 also claimed @entity52 pulled out of the running because they would not commit to a financial package that will exceed £ 20m for one season			1
he said : ‘ the deal with @entity52 did not happen because if you have money and you go to buy a shirt or a pair of trousers , you have to decide whether to buy it or not — @entity52 chose not to			2
i have a feeling they wanted the player free with a number of conditions			2
in any case , they bought the trousers and shirt they wanted and they considered that to be better			2
we have to accept it			2
‘ the clubs that showed an interest in him were @entity76 , @entity44 , @entity46 and @entity45 at the last minute			0
thank @entity77 everything came through with @entity3			1
’ @entity1 ’s arrival signalled @entity15 ’s departure and the @entity82 striker claims he left for @entity45 in order to be the main man at a top - four club			1
@entity15 , 23 , has been desperate to prove himself as a central striker in recent seasons			0
however , more often than not , for club and country , he has been utilised as wide player			0
but with injured @entity92 striker @entity91 out for four months , he will now be given his chance			0
one in , one out : @entity15 sealed a move to @entity45 after @entity1 's move to @entity3 was complete ‘ i ’ve been at @entity3 ever since i was a little boy and i had a great time there , ’ said @entity15 , speaking for the first time since his £ 16m move			1
‘ i believe in their style of play and with the magnificent players in midfield slotting balls through , i can run on to the end of those balls and slot them away			0
‘ this is the next stage of my development , to really show people what i can do			0
i ’d like to bring pace and power to the game			0
‘ i ’ve envisaged myself playing in this team before			0
for it to finally happen is very exciting			0
‘ @entity45 have done well in recent years , last year we got the @entity120 and i feel like it ’s time we could really push on and try and challenge for the @entity123 title			0
‘ i ’ve got one @entity123 medal and it ’s something that i really want to add to			0
’ @entity3 defender @entity125 , @entity127 ’s first signing at @entity12 , has joined @entity52 on loan until the end of the season having failed to make an appearance for the club			1
@entity133 , another man to have left @entity12 in the transfer window , was unveiled as an @entity136 player on wednesday after completing his season - long loan move			1
late move : @entity133 joined @entity136 on tuesday after the @entity123 ratified the move			0

@entity0 has warned @entity1 he must fight for his place at @entity12 this season
@entity1 moved to @entity3 on loan from @entity7 on monday
