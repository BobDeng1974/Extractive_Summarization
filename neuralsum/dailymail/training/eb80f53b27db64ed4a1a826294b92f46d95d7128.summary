by @entity0 a mother was left furious after she was given a parking ticket for leaving her car outside her own home			1
@entity5 , 50 , was charged £ 70 for parking her @entity6 520 on the grass verge outside her family 's house in @entity10 , @entity11 , after pulling up and dashing inside to avoid a hailstorm on sunday			1
just two minutes after she walked through the door , a neighbour called to tell her that a parking warden had appeared and slapped a ticket on her car			1
@entity5 says she parked one wheel of her car on the verge in front of her driveway and was given a parking ticket within two minutes mrs @entity5 , a fish - factory worker , said : ' i have never known anything like it			1
i 'd been away to visit my mother in @entity26 and as i got closer to home , a huge hailstorm started			2
' i pulled up quickly - off the road - with the full intention of going back out when the hail stopped and parking the car on the drive			2
' the most ridiculous thing is that my husband is usually so fussy when it comes to the cars being on the drive , but he 'd had to pull his van forward to get the bins out so there was n't any room for my car			2
' despite informing the traffic warden that she had actually parked in front of her own home , he would n't revoke the ticket , leaving mrs @entity5 facing a fine			1
@entity52 is enforcing verge and footway parking using an experimental @entity55 - which they claim mrs @entity5 infringed			1
her £ 30,000 car was parked partly on the road , with one wheel on the tarmac that leads from the road to the driveway of her family 's suburban semi-detached home			1
mrs @entity5 has paid the £ 70 fine to avoid the long appeals process , but says she would have happily moved the vehicle if the warden had knocked on her front door the mother - of - two says she planned to move the car on to her driveway after sheltering indoors from a hailstorm she said : ' it was a bit over zealous - it was quite clearly my car in front of my house so i do n't know why he could n't have knocked on the door and asked me to move it			1
' there was plenty of room for any wheelchair , pushchair or pedestrian to get by no problem , and i was n't blocking any cars from using the road			0
' when the bins are out each week , they block the path but they do n't do anything about it then , and at school pick up and drop off times , you ca n't move for abandoned cars - but they come picking on me on a quiet sunday afternoon			0
' @entity55 's allow local authorities to bring in temporary or permanent traffic controls on their roads			2
experimental orders , like that mrs @entity5 fell foul to , usually last up to 18 months			1
the law states they can be used to ' avoid danger to persons or traffic ' , ' facilitate the passage of traffic ' or ' preserve the character of a road '			2
councils have to publish plans before bringing them in and listen to any objections from local residents			0
councillor @entity122 said : ' in @entity10 , a @entity123 ( @entity124 ) may be served where a vehicle is found to be parked in contravention of the terms of the @entity55 ( @entity129 )			0
' specifically , the @entity55 is aimed at protecting the footways and grass verges			0
contravention code 62 may be used , which is for being parked with one or more wheels on any part of an urban road other than a carriageway			0
' if a motorist feels that they have been issued a pcn incorrectly , they should informally challenge their notice			0
' this information is also provided on the reverse of the @entity124 , where full details of how to challenge the @entity123 are clearly given			0
' mrs @entity5 and her husband @entity145 , 45 , who have two children , have since paid the penalty charge			1
mr @entity148 , an hgv driver , said : ' we ca n't be bothered to appeal it because it just turns into a long process where they get their way			0
' they would come back with some answer you ca n't get around			0
when you ca n't even park outside your own home , it just makes you think what next ? '			0
