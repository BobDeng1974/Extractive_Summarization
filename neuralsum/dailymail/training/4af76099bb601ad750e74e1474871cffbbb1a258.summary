by @entity1 reporter published : 11:46 est , 16 february 2014 @entity3 : 05:03 est , 17 february 2014 she 's just one month old but it seems you 're never to young to attend the races - certainly not if your name happens to be @entity9			2
the baby daughter of @entity11 made her first public appearance at the @entity14 point - to - point races in @entity15 , where two of her mother 's horses were competing			1
and both seemed to be enjoying the glorious sunny weather as they picked their way across the course , @entity9 safe in her practical black pram			0
ready for action : @entity11 and baby @entity9 were spotted enjoying the sunshine at the @entity14 racecourse @entity11 , 32 , also plumped for a characteristically practical look and wrapped up warmly in a cosy blue padded jacket and a pair of sturdy brown boots			1
@entity11 looked fresh - faced and healthy and beamed broadly as she watched the racing action unfold			1
although rugby player husband @entity33 was nowhere to be seen , the royal was n't short of company and was seen laughing and joking with friends during gaps in the programme			0
admirers : she 's less than a month old but little @entity9 seems to have plenty of fans already all ok ? @entity11 takes a peek at her tiny sleeping daughter to make sure everything is ok @entity11 , who is a trainer in addition to being a successful eventer , had three horses entered for the event , among them , the hotly tipped @entity49 [ sic ]			2
other entries included @entity51 , a six - year - old @entity53 bay , and @entity54 , a horse owned by her mother , @entity56			0
but although her horses , as always , took up much of her time , the new mother was spotted peeping into the pram to check on her sleeping daughter at regular intervals			0
while she wo n't be ready to ride in a point - to - point of her own for a few years , if @entity11 is anything to go by , it probably wo n't be long before little @entity9 starts showing a passion for horses of her own			1
@entity70 : @entity11 seemed on good form just the two of us : @entity9 's father , rugby player @entity33 , was nowhere to be seen off we go : @entity11 's practical choice of pushchair seemed to cope with the rugged grass racecourse			0

@entity11 and her baby daughter were at the @entity14 point - to - point races
the pair enjoyed the glorious sunshine and watched the action
@entity11 was well wrapped up against the cold in her padded jacket
