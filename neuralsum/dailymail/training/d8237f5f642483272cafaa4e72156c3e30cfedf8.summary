by @entity0 published : 08:14 est , 29 april 2013 updated : 11:49 est , 29 april 2013 the @entity2 phenomenon of throwing proms for teen school leavers is now commonplace in the @entity5			1
but it 's no longer just those moving on from sixth form getting the red carpet treatment			0
@entity5 children as young as four are now having proms of their own to mark the auspicious occasion of leaving their nursery to go to ' big ' school			1
the occasion involves little girls dressing up in ball gowns complete with corsages while the boys wear black tie or tuxedos and some are even transported to the event in limos			2
too much too young ? nursery age children are now getting dressed up to attend their own proms ( posed by models ) high street store @entity29 have capitialised on the demand with a range of prom dresses for four - year - olds			1
their march / april magazine showcases some of the garments that will be in store with dresses for ' little ladies ' - including those by designers @entity41 and @entity42 - and suits for ' miniature gents '			2
@entity46 nursery in @entity47 is one of the nurseries up and down the country who have thrown a prom for toddlers			2
on their website , accompanied by a picture of children dressed up in suits and party dresses , they write : ' this year we celebrated in style with a fire engine limo ! the children were able to take part in using the real fire hoses to spray water			2
mr @entity67 once again joined us with his fun disco and party games			0
' belles of the ball : @entity29 have a range of occasion dresses for girls as young as four but while some nurseries may see the prom as an innocent pastime creating an opportunity for children to dress up like princesses and princes and have a party , some parents and experts are alarmed by the idea			1
@entity86 , author of @entity87 , @entity88 , told @entity89 she concerned by the way proms reinforce gender stereotypes at such a young age			1
she said : ' dressing like a prom queen is not a healthy pastime for young children , in my opinion ... by making kids dress according to the extreme of gender apparel , we are telling them that whether they are a boy or girl is their most important feature			1
' ' dressing like a prom queen is not a healthy pastime for young children ' meanwhile , @entity110 , a former head teacher and author of @entity112 , told the newspaper she ' takes issue ' with the nursery proms because she ' believes children should be making mud pies and not squeezing into sequins until at least puberty			1
' many parents will agree with her point that a prom where toddlers pull up in a limo dressed to the nines to be greeted by photographers is too much , too young			2
and it 's not just the emotional cost that may concern them but the financial cost too			0
a prom dress from @entity29 ' children 's range starts at £ 45			2
but competitive mothers may decide to forgo the @entity135 for designers pushing the price into the hundreds			0
then there 's the additional costs of shoes , handbags , transport and photographers			0
another concern for parents is if they set the bar high for their child 's nursery prom , they will have to continue paying out as their child then attends a primary then secondary school prom			1
@entity155 , who carried out research on proms at the @entity158 , found that 90 per cent of secondary schools in @entity160 have a prom now in favour of a school disco with parents spending £ 400 on average			1
' as a ritual in itself , it 's not too concerning , but it 's more about excess of consumption			0
if we 're doing this at nursery , the expected spend accelerates considerably as the child gets older			0
what are they going to expect by the time they are at secondary ? ' she said in @entity89			0
import : @entity2 films such as @entity183 have increased the demand for school proms in the @entity5 it seems @entity29 already have the answer to her question			1
in 2011 ' prom season ' they saw a 57 per cent rise in sales of occasion handbags and a 1,322 per cent sales increase on false lashes			0
@entity29 spokesperson @entity196 said : ' dancing at the school disco seems to have had its day			0
all the focus is now on the prom and being the bell of the ball			0
' as a result the @entity5 brand has also seen an increase in demand from under 18s for their personal shopping service where an expert advises them on style and accessorising			1
whether this service will soon be in demand from four - year - olds remains to be seen .			0
