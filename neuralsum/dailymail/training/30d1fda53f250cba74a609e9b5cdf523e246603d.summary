a midwife caught dosing herself with laughing gas in a hospital delivery room has been thrown out of the profession			2
@entity4 inhaled so deeply on the nitrous oxide at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8 , that she was overheard by colleagues			1
they later heard her snoring as she had a quick kip on her rest break			0
colleagues of @entity4 at @entity6 heard her inhaling laughing gas in the delivery room @entity18 tried to wake her twice by knocking on the door but found it was locked			1
when quizzed the midwife said she had taken the gas to help her sleep			2
she was suspended and made to carry out a 450 hour online learning course and write a 3,000 word ' reflective piece '			0
but she struck again on may 6 , 2013 , when back at work , this time taking a 4mg tablet of the antihistamine chlorphenamine , which also has a sedative effect , from the drugs cabinet			1
@entity4 , who was not present but was represented at wednesday 's @entity34 hearing in @entity35 , @entity36 , admitted the charges and a string of other failings			2
these included not flagging up that a patient 's blood pressure had increased to senior staff and giving a patient the powerful painkiller co-codamol without recording it , all on may 16			1
she also did not immediately transfer a woman who was 28 weeks pregnant with twins to the labour ward after being shown worrying signs her unborn babies were in distress			0
the midwife , who was later cautioned by police for stealing cosmetics , fragrance and children 's clothing from @entity60 , accepted her actions amounted to misconduct and impaired her fitness to practise			0
witness @entity63 , a supervisor midwife at the hospital , sent @entity4 home after she used the @entity67 equipment during a rest break			1
the gas is often inhaled for recreation but its medical use is as a painkiller the mixture of 50 per cent nitrous oxide and 50 per cent oxygen is supposed to be reserved for patients with a need for acute , short - term pain relief			1
entonox canisters contain 50 per cent nitrous oxide and 50 per cent oxygen for use as an analgesic ms @entity63 told the hearing : ' when i told @entity4 she had been heard using the @entity67 equipment by her colleagues she admitted it immediately			1
' i therefore felt she should not remain on that shift and should go home but i wanted her to see a health professional first			0
' as it was a night shift , the only place she could do that was @entity92 and e but she declined that , and i also offered her a taxi home but she declined that as well			0
' @entity4 admitted six separate counts of misconduct put to her			1
the panel found @entity4 's fitness to practise currently impaired and ordered she be struck off the @entity101 register			1
announcing its decision , panel chair @entity102 said she put ' vulnerable ' women in her care at risk of ' significant ' harm and did not provide ' safe , responsive and compassionate ' care			0
ms @entity102 said : ' the failures and omissions identified in this case were serious ; some were far removed from the basic , fundamental standards of care expected of a midwife			0
' we considered @entity4 's misconduct to have placed vulnerable patients at unwarranted risk and she abused her position of trust ' the risk of significant physical and emotional harm to @entity92 , @entity124 and their unborn babies was great			2
' doing harm to others or behaving in such a way that could foresee ably result in harm to others , particularly patients whether deliberately , recklessly , negligently or through incompetence is unacceptable			0
' the seriousness of the potential harm that the registrant caused to these patients coupled with the caution for dishonesty is incompatible with on - going registration			0

@entity4 was caught out at @entity6 in @entity7 , @entity8
claimed she used the @entity67 equipment , containing half nitrous oxide and half oxygen and meant for patients in pain , to ' help her sleep '
also admitted taking a sedative from the drugs cabinet and prescribing a patient the powerful painkiller co-codamol without recording it
@entity101 struck her off for her misconduct
