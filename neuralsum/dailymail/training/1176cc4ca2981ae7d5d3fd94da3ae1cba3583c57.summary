by @entity0 published : 19:49 est , 17 november 2013 updated : 04:33 est , 18 november 2013 she fled @entity2 four years ago after social workers dismissed her as not intelligent enough to get married , let alone become a mother			1
but now @entity5 has returned home – and is facing an investigation by officials who , she believes , will decide if her two young sons should be taken from her			1
the 21 - year - old , who has mild learning difficulties , ran away to @entity13 with her fiancé @entity14 when she was eight months pregnant because she feared their son would be taken into care immediately after his birth			1
their baby , @entity19 , was born in january 2010 and the couple went on to wed and have another son , @entity22 , two years ago			1
new battle : @entity5 with husband @entity14 , left , and two sons @entity19 , right , and @entity22 , left			1
@entity2 officials wish to speak with the mother after she left for @entity13 when she was pregnant despite being classed as fit parents by social services in @entity13 , they missed family and friends in @entity31 , @entity32 , and two weeks ago , they returned to @entity2			1
the @entity33 believed that the authorities would no longer be interested in them			0
last night , however , they told how social workers visited the family only days after their arrival to say they were reopening proceedings to decide if the boys should be placed under a protection order			1
on saturday , they received a letter from @entity43 summoning them to a meeting with a panel of social workers , doctors and other child experts next week			1
mr @entity5 , 30 , said : ‘ it is talking about a “ protection case conference ”			2
it is a very formal letter and feels threatening			0
@entity5 and i are extremely nervous and very worried			2
‘ we have nothing to defend			0
we are a normal family and have no idea why @entity32 social services feel this is necessary or what they expect us to do or say			2
’ he added : ‘ @entity5 and i can hardly sleep			2
we are sick with worry that our sons could be taken away from us			0
we feel very upset because we believed all this was behind us			0
‘ we have gone through every assessment possible in @entity13 ; our sons are happy , healthy children with married parents			1
unnerving : the young mother , pictured at home , says she can not bear the thought of her children being taken away from her ‘ yes , @entity5 has mild learning difficulties but they do n’t stop her from being a mum			1
and there is no reason why we should be put through the mill again			0
’ mrs @entity75 said : ‘ i ca n’t bear the thought of my boys being taken away			0
it ’s making me ill. ’ the saga began in september 2009 when their church wedding was halted 48 hours before it was due to take place because social services felt the bride ‘ did not understand the implications of getting married ’			0
mrs @entity75 was later told her baby would be removed at birth and placed with foster parents , sparking their decision to flee the @entity90			0
in january 2010 , while living in @entity91 , she gave birth to @entity19			2
days later @entity13 social workers , alerted by the ruling of their @entity2 counterparts , took the child into care			1
after nine months of assessments , during which @entity19 lived with foster carers , social services assessed the mother as fit to care for her son			1
the couple then wed at @entity91 register office and set up home nearby , having another son , @entity22 , in november 2011			2
but the family became homesick			0
mrs @entity75 said : ‘ @entity31 has always been my home and i wanted to bring my sons up in the same place i grew up			0
’ the couple claim they visited @entity32 in october to speak to social services about returning			0
mr @entity5 said : ‘ we felt surely by now , with two children , they could see that @entity5 was fine and would n’t have any problems			2
‘ we spoke to them and they agreed that was the case – in fact they seemed amazed that we ’d gone to see them at all			0
’ but they now face a case meeting on november 25			0
referring to the @entity33 ’ case , @entity127 @entity126 mp @entity125 , who has campaigned for more openness in family courts , said : ‘ the @entity13 authorities have studied their care for their children and concluded there is no problem			1
‘ however , the @entity90 authorities want to investigate further ... it does appear the authorities in @entity32 are being vindictive in the way they are dealing with this			0
’ @entity140 , head of children and families at @entity32 , said : ‘ as with any family moving back to @entity32 , we will continue to meet with @entity5 and @entity14 to discuss their circumstances so that they receive the care and support they need			1
