@entity2 faces being crippled by debt until 2021 , with devastating consequences for its population of 500million people , including those in @entity9 , @entity0 warned yesterday			1
the @entity12 chancellor ’s gloomy forecast of ten years of economic misery followed the failure at the @entity16 summit in @entity17 to agree how to bail out bankrupt @entity18			1
‘ this debt crisis will not simply go away , ’ mrs @entity0 said			0
‘ it will certainly be a decade before we are in a better position			0
’ warning : @entity0 has predicted that @entity2 's debt crisis is unlikely to be resolved any time soon in her weekly podcast to the @entity12 people , she added that to have any chance of solving the crisis , everyone in @entity2 had to ‘ make an effort and do their homework ’			1
the grim message came as economic forecasters warned that the eurozone crisis could knock back @entity9 's economy by six years			1
the @entity36 predicted that @entity9 's gross domestic product could fall by 4 per cent to below its levels during the 2008 - 09 recession , reported @entity40			1
@entity41 , senior economic adviser at the firm , said : ' we could see a contraction of 5 or 6 per cent in the eurozone			2
share prices could fall by 30 or 40 per cent and credit conditions would tighten as they did after the collapse of the @entity49			0
' @entity50 , meanwhile , has stepped up the pressure on mrs @entity0 to use her clout as the eurozone ’s most powerful leader to sort out the financial crisis			0
the summit resulted in a poker - like stand - off that saw the @entity9 prime minister form a powerful new alliance with @entity60 and the @entity61 , with mrs @entity0 , @entity63 ’s @entity62 and the rest of the @entity65 on the other side			1
@entity9 , the @entity67 and @entity61 angered the @entity12 and @entity63 by vetoing a multi-billion rescue package for @entity18 by the @entity69			1
they said @entity12 , @entity63 and other eurozone countries must reach deeper into their own pockets first			1
it led to angry exchanges , including another attack on mr @entity50 by mr @entity62 , who said the @entity79 ‘ do n’t understand @entity2 because you come from an island ’			0
demonstrators protest against job cuts in central @entity82 yesterday			0
leading economic forecasters have warned that the eurozone crisis could push back @entity9 's economy by six years meeting : last week 's @entity16 summit failed to find a resolution for the eurozone 's problems the row came as the @entity18 prime minister @entity91 , who is clinging to power a day after narrowly winning a confidence vote from @entity93 , admitted his country was facing ‘ critical times ’ ahead of his attempt to push the @entity65 ’s bailout deal through parliament			1
without the money - contained in an agreement hammered out by @entity65 leaders on october 27 - @entity18 would go bankrupt by @entity102 , leaving the country unable to pay the wages of public workers such as doctors , nurses and police officers			1
mr @entity91 held talks with @entity18 president @entity110 in which he signalled his intention to form a ‘ government of national unity ’ focused on ratifying the deal , which offers loans and a write - off of @entity18 ’s international debts in exchange for drastic spending cuts and other austerity measures			1
the prospect of further cuts to their living standards has led to strikes and protests on the streets of @entity126			0
‘ co-operation is necessary to guarantee for @entity18 and for our partners that we can honour our commitments , ’ mr @entity91 said			1
under fire : @entity91 's position as @entity18 prime minister hangs by a thread potential successor : finance minister @entity136 could take over from mr @entity91 reports from @entity126 last night suggested that despite mr @entity91 surviving the no - confidence vote , he could be soon replaced by his finance minister , @entity136			1
mr @entity136 was at the centre of farcical scenes last week when mr @entity91 shocked his @entity65 partners , and sent the financial markets into turmoil , by calling for a national referendum on the deal that they thought had already been agreed			0
mr @entity136 complained that he had not been consulted ahead of the announcement , and was then admitted to hospital with stomach pains			0
he publicly criticised the referendum decision , cranking up the pressure that led mr @entity91 to later abandon the plan			0
mr @entity91 won friday ’s late - night , knife - edge confidence vote by 153 votes to 145			0
the markets will be watched nervously for their reaction when they open tomorrow after another weekend of economic turmoil			2
the bond market – which determines the interest charged to governments – has been particularly influential in determining the pace of the crisis			0
@entity165 borrowing costs have soared in particular , with the interest on ten - year loans now priced at more than 6.3 per cent			0
defiant : @entity50 opposes an @entity69 bailout for the troubled eurozone anything over six per cent is said to signal that a government is heading for a default on its debts and tends to lead to a knock - on rise in the interest rates charged to other vulnerable economies , such as @entity177 and @entity178			0
@entity165 and @entity63 banks are heavily exposed to the sovereign debt problems in @entity126 and @entity181 , and have seen their share prices slide steeply throughout the year			0
if major institutions collapsed it could have a domino effect on dozens of other banks , including those in the @entity9			1
mr @entity50 is determined to stand by his refusal to approve an @entity69 rescue for @entity18 until the @entity65 finalises plans for its own bailout			2
‘ how can the world economy do this kind of thing when @entity2 can not sort out its problems ? ’ said a senior @entity193 source			2
‘ we were ready to back the @entity69 deal but the @entity12 must do more to push the @entity65 deal			1
something has got to give			0
’ another @entity9 source said the @entity12 ’ reluctance to go further in helping out @entity18 stemmed partly from their fear that it might trigger a repeat of @entity207 - style hyper - inflation in @entity12 that fuelled the rise of @entity209			1
and it is believed that mrs @entity0 fears a backlash from @entity12 voters if they are asked to give more money to prop up countries such as @entity18			1
if a @entity9 - backed multi-billion @entity69 rescue goes ahead , mr @entity50 is ready to resist moves to block it by @entity220 @entity219 mps			2
‘ countries which give money to the @entity69 always get it back , ’ said a senior @entity222 aide			2
‘ if we gave £ 10 billion to the @entity69 it does not mean £ 10 billion less for schools and hospitals here			0
we would get it back			2
’ and @entity219 officials say there is no need for a @entity232 vote to approve any such deal , removing the threat of @entity219 rebels teaming up with @entity236 to defeat mr @entity50			0
the turmoil in @entity18 has increased expectations that the country will crash out of the eurozone , with chaotic knock - on effects for economies across the continent			2
chancellor @entity244 has admitted that the return of the drachma would be ‘ pretty traumatic ’ for the @entity9			1
treasury officials have been ‘ war gaming ’ about how to best protect the @entity9 economy if that happens			1
‘ the @entity9 government prepares for all contingencies			2
you would expect us to do that			0
it is our responsibility to the @entity9 people , ’ mr @entity244 said			2
‘ we are dealing with our debts , dealing with our situation , but we are also planning and prepared for whatever the world and whatever the eurozone throws at us			0
