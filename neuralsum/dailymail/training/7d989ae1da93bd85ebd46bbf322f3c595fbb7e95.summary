by @entity0 last updated at 5:57 pm on 25th october 2011 a civil servant who downloaded more than 28,000 indecent images of children from the internet said his sordid habit was no different to ' stamp collecting '			1
@entity7 , of @entity8 , near @entity9 , @entity10 , catalogued and stored the vile pictures and films on cds and dvds , many of which he then protected with ten layers of encryption			1
but the married 53 - year - old told the police he got no sexual gratification and that he hoarded the vile images in the same way people collect stamps or coins			1
police found more than 28,000 child porn images on @entity7 ' computer , which he had amassed over a 12 - year period ( posed by model ) now @entity32 civilian worker @entity7 , who the court heard held a ' responsible job with the @entity35 ' , has been jailed for a year			1
and judge @entity37 , sitting at @entity36 , told him : ' it is very far from stamp collecting			2
' the interest in these images and the market that this interest creates is what drives the production of the images and the production involves the abuse of children , and very young ones at that			2
' @entity53 , prosecuting , told how police raided his home in july 2009 after receiving information that he had been downloading child pornography			2
and when they took away his computer and storage media they found 28,114 indecent pictures and a further 199 movies of children			2
among the more serious images , he said , two - thirds were of children under the age of thirteen and a sample of the less serious all fell into the younger category			0
the last images had been created the day before the police raid and the first in october 1997 , almost twelve years earlier			1
many of the more serious images involved the abuse of children under 10 and some as young as five			0
he had also been typing entries for ' pre-teen hardcore ' pornography and similar terms into search engines			0
when they examined the storage media they found more than 3,000 encrypted files , none of which could be accessed without unlocking			0
jailed : @entity36 @entity89 ( pictured ) heard @entity7 held a ' responsible job with the @entity35 ' hawkins pleaded guilty to one count of possession and thirteen of making indecent images of @entity96 , defending , said since his arrest his client has been on a course run by charity @entity100 to address his offending			1
he said the reason for encrypting the files was to stop anyone else , such as his wife , finding them and he gave the passwords to the police when they asked			0
the judge said : ' you have in due course entered guilty plea to all charges having initially denied them in interview and having maintained for a long time that this was innocent possession , nothing to do with you			0
â€˜ then possession came on the back of adult pornography , then possession in the form of some urge to collect images rather than getting any sexual gratification from it relating it to stamp collecting			0
it is very far from stamp collecting			0
' as well as jailing him , the judge also banned him from working with children and told him he must register as a sex offender for ten years			1
a spokesman for the @entity32 said : ' it would be inappropriate for the @entity32 to comment further on what is a civil matter			1

@entity7 worked for the @entity32
he accumulated vile collection over 12 years
