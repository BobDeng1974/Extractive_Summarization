by @entity0 published : 13:16 est , 10 october 2012 updated : 17:01 est , 10 october 2012 a woman who was brutally beaten and raped on a first date has spoken about her brave refusal to hand over details of what she looked up on @entity6 to be used against her by the defense			1
@entity9 was 23 when she was attacked in the @entity10 , @entity12 apartment of @entity13 , a 37 - year - old anesthesiologist after setting up a date with him through @entity15			1
she spoke about her decision to defy the defense 's subpoena for her @entity6 searches , @entity21 profile and even the journals she wrote in counseling to help her deal with the horrific assault			1
she told the today show that she was shocked to have been asked for the personal material			0
she said : ' i was not the criminal			0
investigating me and my life , it did n't seem right , it did n't seem just			0
' ms @entity9 decided to go public following the attack in hopes of encouraging other sexual assault victims to report their attacks and not feel 're - victimized ' by the system			2
though she expected to be questioned by police and interrogated by @entity13 's prominent attorney , she did not expect that they would try to use her own @entity6 searches against her in an attempt to diminish the seriousness of the attack			1
ms @entity9 added : ' you make internet searches all the time but you never think that anyone is going to be looking in and using that as a reason as a defense over something horrific that happened to you			1
' @entity13 's lawyers ordered ms @entity9 to turn over her @entity6 searches because they wanted to show that around the time of the february 2011 attack , ms @entity9 searched for the definition of rape			1
defense attorneys believed that this would help support @entity13 's story that their sexual was rough but consensual , and ms @entity9 regretted it after the fact so she was looking for a way to argue her way out of it			1
guilty : @entity13 ( right ) was sentenced to 25 years in jail after raping miss @entity9 after his lawyer @entity79 ( left ) attempted to subpoena her @entity6 searches victim : @entity9 , pictured , was raped and beaten by @entity13 after meeting him on @entity15 victims advocates , however , decried the move			1
@entity83 , director of the @entity84 said ' it 's subjecting them to re-victimization by the system '			0
the filing for the search results was the first of its kind in @entity12 , and though the both the county judge ruled that the order was justified and the state supreme court ruled that too much time had passed to appeal , the district attorney did not comply with the order			2
@entity6 also refused to turn over their user ’s information as protected by the federal @entity101 unless she agreed , which she did not			2
in the end , ms @entity9 did n’t turn over her searches or her journals , but the sympathetic judge did not react with a contempt of court charge			1
‘ i chose not to because i did n't think it was fair or correct , ’ ms @entity9 said			2
instead of penalizing the victim , the jury sentenced @entity13 to spend the next 25 years in jail as he was found guilty of rape , sodomy , strangulation and assault			2
case did n't work : @entity13 's lawyer tried to have the victim 's @entity6 searches submitted as evidence in order to suggest she did not really know what rape was he was also facing charges that stem back to an alleged sexual assault of a prior girlfriend , but her claims were dismissed since the judge found them to be less valid because she continued to date him after the incident took place			1
he will also have to pay a $ 112,000 fine , and $ 50,000 of that money will go the ms @entity9 , who moved to @entity12 just months before the attack after accepting a job as a research chemist at @entity136			1
she is now training to become a high school chemistry teacher			0
aside from the unusual invasion into ms @entity9 ’s privacy , the story of the attack is becoming a disturbingly familiar trend as there have been many instances of sexual assaults during dates that came to fruition via online dating sites			2
in ms @entity9 ’s case , she met @entity13 at a drink at a bistro in downtown @entity10 , and they then went together to @entity13 ’s condo which was directly across the street for a glass of wine			1
smirking : @entity13 , who is a licensed anesthesiologist , also faced charges over sexually assaulting an ex-girlfriend but those charges were dropped very soon after entering the condo , ms @entity9 was beaten , raped , and strangled until she passed out			1
she said that the abuse took place over the course of several hours			0
after reporting the crime to police , she suffered scrutiny from both internet trolls and local news reporters , who published the police report and highlighted her bra size			0
she has since moved to @entity172			0
‘ yes , i was raped			0
it does n't make me a bad person			0
i did n't make poor choices			0
i was not the criminal , ’ she told @entity173			0
‘ ( @entity13 ’s sentencing is ) the one nugget that i could hold on to through all of this -- that a dangerous criminal will be off the streets			0
