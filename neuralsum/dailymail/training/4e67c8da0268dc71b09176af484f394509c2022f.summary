by @entity0 published : 11:38 est , 22 september 2013 updated : 12:00 est , 22 september 2013 a former @entity2 weapons chief has claimed that he was ordered to by president @entity3 to use chemical weapons on his own people , but that he could not bring himself to do it			2
brigadier - general @entity7 , who was in charge of chemical weapons in a contested area of southern @entity2 , said he was given orders directly from @entity3 to use deadly gases on rebel soldiers , but replaced the payloads with a harmless substitute			1
the general , who has moved to @entity18 , also said he believed that the @entity2 government had perpetrated 34 chemical weapons attacks , many more than the 14 previously thought			2
orders : @entity22 claims that president @entity3 ( pictured ) ordered him to use chemical weapons against the @entity2 people three times the @entity3 regime still vigorously denies that it ever ordered chemical weapons attacks – which it blames on rebel forces – but it has nonetheless admitted that it possesses chemical weapons , and has agreed a sensitive deal to hand over its arsenal			1
but , in an interview with @entity34 , general @entity7 also claimed that @entity3 is trying to ‘ cheat ’ the deal , brokered by @entity36 , by sending a portion of his chemical weapons to allies in @entity40 and @entity41			1
international pressure on @entity2 came to a head last month after footage emerged of the victims of an attack in the country ’s capital city , @entity49			0
@entity51 inspectors were later allowed to inspect the site , and found evidence that the deadly chemical agent sarin had been used , killing more than 1,400 people			0
but the general says that chemical attacks had been ordered – and were underway - long before that			2
avoided : a @entity2 man mourns a dead body after a sarin gas attack			0
general @entity7 says he prevented three similar attacks from taking place weapons : @entity51 inspectors found evidence of deadly sarin gas having been used against @entity2 people ( file photo ) in the interview he said that he had been ordered to attack civilian targets in the rebel districts of @entity73 , @entity74 , and @entity75 , using a mixture of phosgene and other chlorine - based gases , which are less deadly than sarin			1
but general @entity7 said that before each of the attacks – between october 2012 and january 2013 - he secretly replaced the chemical canisters with a mixture of bleach and water , which would still smell like deadly chemical weapons but not kill anybody			1
he said : ‘ they were completely convinced that this was the same poisonous material			0
in this way i saved hundreds of lives of children and others			0
’ deal : president @entity3 and president @entity95 brokered a deal to surrender @entity98 chemical weapons ( file photo ) he then fled to @entity18 after he felt his superiors were suspicious of the lack of deaths caused by his attacks , but claims to have been keeping up with the progress of the attacks using a network of informants			0
although @entity110 has agreed to hand over his weapons , and @entity36 officials have said they are making plans for what to do if @entity3 ‘ cheats ’ the system			0
but general @entity7 said that before a deal was even proposed , the @entity2 regime had begun sending its weapons to allies in the militant organisation @entity121 in @entity40 at four different sites			1
a spokesman for the rebel @entity124 , backed the claims , saying : ‘ we , along with many other international sources learned , through documents and other evidence about the transfer of @entity2 chemical weapons to @entity121 in @entity40 nearly three months ago			2
