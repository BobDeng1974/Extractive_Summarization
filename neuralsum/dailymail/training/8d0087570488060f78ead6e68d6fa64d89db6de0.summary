sir @entity0 has compared the beginning of @entity4 's @entity3 reign to his own troubled start at @entity6 and backed the @entity7 to turn the club around			1
@entity9 has lost three of his opening eight games in charge after spending more than £ 150million on new players to overhaul a squad largely built by @entity0			1
the @entity15 took three - and - a - half years to win his first trophy at @entity6 after the board refused to bow to pressure to sack him , and he is in no doubt that @entity9 will receive the same support now even though his predecessor @entity22 was axed after just 10 months in charge			1
' what we needed then was sir @entity66 , @entity67 and the board to stick by me and we had a great spell after that			1
' once i got settled into the club , everything was fine			1
louis is going through that same process and there 's no doubt in my mind that he will sort it out			0
' @entity0 ( right ) watches his @entity6 side lose their first game against @entity80 back in 1986 @entity81 ( facing forward ) is congratulated by his team - mates after netting against @entity50 @entity0 discusses everything from @entity6 's summer signings to his relationship with @entity9 with @entity27 @entity86 is introduced as a club ambassador by @entity0 at @entity3 - his last appearance at the club @entity0 says @entity9 ( left , at a press conference in 2009 ) has not sough him out for advice @entity0 revealed that @entity9 has not sought him out for advice since taking over in the summer , adding : ' there 's no ongoing dialogue			1
he comes into my office sometimes after the game , into the lounge , and we have a chat			0
' but it 's not a matter of picking up a phone or anything like that			0
he 's a very capable person with a strong mentality			0
he 's a strong leader			0
he knows where i am if he ever did need me but there has not been any need for him to phone me			0
' the 72 - year - old played a prominent role in appointing @entity22 and was then criticised for being too high profile at @entity6 games , casting a shadow over his successor as he struggled to get to grips with the magnitude of the job			1
@entity0 watches the final day of the @entity120 at @entity121 with @entity123 captain @entity122 ( right ) @entity0 spoke to the @entity125 team before the @entity120 about performing when favourites to win the 72 - year - old gives a speech at the @entity129 in @entity130 , @entity131 , last week asked if he is annoyed at how that has been portrayed , he said : ' there 's a bit of that			1
i have n't been to every game , obviously			1
i 've missed a couple this season already but i 've been to a few of them and i continue to do that			1
' the way i 've always been and i did it as a manager , i 'm actually quite stone - faced watching a game			2
i do n't try to show any emotions unless we score			2
i always celebrate a goal , even now as a director i still celebrate a goal			0
you 're always conscious maybe the cameras are on you and this is happening quite a lot			0
' i got annoyed when we lost to @entity38 last year			0
i did n't enjoy that			2
i do n't like losing to @entity38 and @entity157 last year , because they are your biggest rivals and the ones you always strive to defeat and are always in our way			2
' @entity0 , watching @entity6 take on @entity162 last season , says he is ' stone - faced ' when in the stands @entity165 celebrates in @entity38 's 3 - 0 win at @entity3 last season , a result which annoyed @entity0 the breakup of @entity0 's squad , in particular the £ 16m sale of @entity171 to @entity172 , and spending on headline signings like @entity175 and @entity32 has raised concerns that @entity6 have betrayed their roots of bringing young players through their academy			1
@entity0 's old no 2 @entity180 even suggested that @entity171 's departure was a sign that the club 's ' identity has been broken '			1
but @entity0 backed @entity9 's restructuring and praised the new manager for giving the likes of @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 an opportunity in the @entity193			1
' what has pleased me about @entity196 is he 's given seven young kids their debuts this year which falls into line with the history of our club , there 's no question about that , ' he added			2
' i think that 's exactly what @entity4 believes in too			1
i think the greatest example is how he produced at @entity210 to win the @entity211 with all players created by @entity210 themselves			1
@entity213 was in goal , @entity215 , @entity216			0
some fantastic players - all produced by the club			1
@entity9 has given youngster @entity188 ( left ) opportunities to play first - team football this season academy product @entity189 ( right , in action against @entity35 ) has also featured in the first team today ' @entity196 has made a lot of changes and i was thinking about that actually			1
maybe he 's doing the right and correct thing , to clear the decks and build his own team , because he 's got the experience and the coaching ability to do that			2
and he 's got the reputation to do that			0
i think the way he 's approached is , i think , brilliant			0
' it 's the rebuilding of the team and they brought in some good quality			2
it was really important because you need quality at @entity6 , you need the best players			1
' i think when you can identify ability like that needed by @entity6 , they have the resources to do that			1
they are fees i never quite equalled but nonetheless they were needing quite a big injection this year			0
' ( @entity255 ) @entity254 played against us three years ago for @entity257 in the @entity258			2
he 's a talented young player and we scouted him quite a lot at that time			2
obviously i think they tried to get him last year but it fell through for some reason or another			0
he 's athletic , quite aggressive actually for a lad who has not got a great frame and he 's quite slim but he 's quite aggressive and he gets around the pitch			0
@entity9 allowed @entity171 to leave @entity3 for @entity172 in a £ 16m deadline day deal @entity0 admits @entity6 attempted to sign @entity269 ( right ) when he was just 16 before landing him for £ 30m ' the signing of ( @entity269 ) @entity269 was the one we tried to get when he was 16 years of age			1
they would n't sell him to us but they always said we 'd be first to know if they ever did			2
of course , @entity273 has carried that through and we got him for , i think it was £ 30m			2
he 's a talented boy , a good footballer who likes to get forward all the time			0
' ( @entity278 ) @entity277 , the @entity279 boy , i watched him at the @entity280 , i thought he did really well for them and i think he 's capable of playing either left side as a wing - back if you like or as a centre - back			1
' @entity286 is one of those common - sense footballers that make up a team			1
he 's probably a version of @entity291 of a few years ago , that type of player			0
he 's a good professional with common sense to his game			0
he keeps it simple and protects the defenders and the attacking midfield players in his role			0
' the big one is @entity32 who we 're all waiting to see			0
obviously , he has fantastic goalscoring ability			0
he had his injury so getting him on loan is the right thing to do			0

sir @entity0 has backed @entity4 to get @entity6 back on track after a *difficult* start to the season
the former @entity313 boss says the @entity7 *deserves* time at the club
@entity0 did n't win a trophy for three - and - a - half years at @entity3
but @entity22 was given just 10 months before being sacked
@entity9 is building his own team after spending over £ 150m on players
@entity0 says he speaks with @entity9 but there is ' no ongoing dialogue '
