@entity1 are through to the knockout stages of the @entity3 for the very first time , so many fans will be unfamiliar with the history of the north african nation			1
here , @entity7 helps shine a light on @entity1 's colourful past and present ahead of their last - 16 clash against @entity12			1
speaking of the @entity14 , this could prove to be a feisty clash			2
read on to find out why ... star : @entity1 striker @entity17 will lead the line against @entity12 in the last 16 of the @entity3 1 @entity1 's first opponents at the 1982 @entity3 in @entity20 were none other than @entity23 champions @entity12 , who boasted a squad with the likes of @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
the result was far from what was expected			0
@entity1 played vibrant football , shocking the @entity14 with a 2 - 1 victory			1
2 the 1982 finals began with joy but ended in controversial despair for @entity1			1
with @entity12 and @entity40 ’s match set to be played after the @entity42 ' final group game , the two sides knew a 1 - 0 win for the @entity14 would put both through , and the @entity42 would be eliminated on goal difference			1
unsurprisingly , that was exactly what happened			0
the match has become known in @entity12 as the ' non-aggression pact of @entity49 ' and rather less favourably in @entity1 as the @entity50			1
it led to a change in scheduling for the final group games , beginning at the 1986 finals in @entity56 , @entity51 ordered the final games of the group to be played simultaneously to avoid a repeat of the match in @entity49			0
farce : @entity62 ( left ) heads @entity12 into the lead against @entity40 in 1982 3 @entity1 ’s only goal in the 1986 finals in @entity56 came from one @entity65 , uncle of @entity67 legend @entity66			1
@entity65 featured in the impressive campaign in 1982 as well			2
now assistant to @entity70 at @entity71 , @entity66 ’s parents originated from @entity1 but migrated to @entity67 in the 1950s			2
a supposed friendly fixture between the two countries in october 2001 ended in acrimony			0
@entity66 received death threats prior to the game and was taunted throughout			0
the tie was eventually abandoned due to a pitch invasion by young @entity67 - @entity80			0
glory : @entity65 ( right ) celebrates victory over @entity12 with coach @entity83 and @entity84 4 @entity1 ’s impressive performance in @entity86 this summer contrasts dramatically to their dismal campaign in @entity88 four years ago			1
in a group with @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 , @entity1 were soon on their way home with one solitary point from a bore - draw with @entity90 , and without scoring a single goal			2
in fact , @entity17 ’s penalty in the twenty - fourth minute against @entity99 this month was @entity1 ’s first goal at a @entity3 in twenty - eight years			1
raising the bar : @entity1 's bore draw with @entity90 was about as bad as international football can get 5 one of the stars of the 1982 @entity3 was @entity106 , scorer of the winning goal against @entity12			1
@entity106 had received praise from @entity109 and was supposed to be on his way to @entity111 in 1985 , a team which included the great @entity113			0
the move ended up falling apart when the striker broke his leg in the @entity117			0
heroes : @entity106 ( front row , fifth left ) and the @entity1 team selected for the 1982 @entity3 in @entity20 6 along with nine other players , @entity122 left his successful career in @entity67 with @entity125 in 1958 to take part in the first squad of the @entity128 , which sought independence from the @entity67			1
technically , @entity122 and co were playing for a country which did not exist			0
but regardless of the chaos in @entity1 , the team continued to play and in 1962 @entity1 was officially declared independent from @entity67 with a national football programme created			2
who said football was just a game ? 7 it is believed that @entity17 was a transfer target for @entity140 in 2013 and @entity141 in 2012			0
the forward is currently playing in @entity143 with @entity144 and assisted eight goals in the 2013/14 season			0
prayer : @entity148 ( right ) runs to join his team - mates in celebration of @entity17 's goal against @entity99 8 as a youngster , @entity152 would often go fishing using a plastic bottle tied to several pieces of string because he could not afford either a rod or net			0
@entity152 , @entity1 ’s top goalscorer in @entity86 this summer , netted against @entity160 on thursday to knock out @entity162 ’s side from the @entity3			1
passion : @entity165 fans celebrate on the @entity166 in @entity167 after qualifying for the last 16 9 @entity169 star @entity66 has shown his support for @entity1			1
he said , ‘ @entity1 has always been in my heart			2
they ( @entity67 and @entity1 ) are the two teams that i have always supported and that i want to see win			2
moment of madness : @entity66 ( left ) is one of the greatest players in history , despite this infamous clash 10 @entity179 won the @entity180 in 1997 - the @entity181 that is , with @entity183 's @entity182			0
@entity179 has also been known to speak about himself in the third person			0
he once informed his critical press that he had three million fans on @entity187 and said ' so you see now that some people like @entity179			0
