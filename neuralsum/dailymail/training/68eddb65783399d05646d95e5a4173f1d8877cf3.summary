by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:03 est , 8 december 2012 updated : 14:45 est , 15 december 2012 thousands of hospital beds are set to be scrapped under secret plans drawn up by @entity6 managers			1
doctors warn the loss of so many beds will put patients at risk in an @entity6 that is already ‘ overwhelmed ’			1
cutbacks : the number of hospital beds could be cut by up to 25 per cent in some areas ( stock image ) the proposals , tucked away in documents published by trusts planning to close or downgrade @entity21 departments , reveal : the plan suggests that @entity23 and other services will play a bigger role in providing care in the community the disclosures come just days after the publication of a report warning that hospitals are ‘ full to bursting ’ , with @entity33 figures showing that 94 per cent of beds were occupied last month – more than the recommended maximum of 85 per cent to ensure patient safety			1
campaigners argue the proposed cuts are being ‘ smuggled through without proper debate ’			2
dr @entity40 , chairwoman of the @entity41 , said : ‘ i ’m shocked			0
we do n’t have enough beds			2
we ’ll be looking after sicker and sicker people in the community , with nowhere to put them			2
‘ we ca n’t cope			0
community services are stretched beyond belief			1
@entity48 will suffer in the end			0
we could end up with beds in corridors all over again			2
’ a report for @entity53 , which was leaked to @entity54 , assesses proposals to close four out of the area ’s nine casualty units			1
the opening page of the report , which was written by independent public - health specialist dr @entity59 , warns that its contents should not be ‘ quoted or disseminated ’ and are strictly for ‘ limited circulation ’			0
the report says the closures involve ‘ a significant shift of health care activity and expenditure ’ , to be achieved by closing @entity21 wards and ‘ a reduction in the number of hospital beds ’			1
dr @entity59 writes : ‘ a potentially more serious issue than the closure of @entity74 is the reduction in number of hospital beds by nearly 25 per cent			1
however , details of the clinical rationale and modelling used to arrive at the proposal are absent			0
’ he adds that ‘ any shortcoming in the plans to compensate for this by strengthening and improving out - of - hospital care will have serious consequences for patients and families ’			1
none of the hundreds of bed closures in @entity91 – mostly acute beds along with 20 paediatric and maternity – are explicitly mentioned in a 78 - page consultation document supplied to local residents			1
' putting lives at risk ' : campaigners argue hospitals are currently operating at full capacity and community services are already at breaking point dr @entity103 , director of campaign group @entity104 , described the plans as ‘ shockingly irresponsible ’			1
he said : ‘ this is being smuggled through without proper debate			0
the consultation document told local people and health professionals only part of the story , and kept key details tucked away in obscure documents			0
we urge a reopening of consultation and a proper debate with all the facts on the table			0
’ in @entity121 , a special administrator appointed by the government to oversee changes at @entity125 , which is close to bankruptcy , has highlighted the need to close hundreds of beds			1
the information is on page 54 of @entity131 of the administrator ’s draft report and reveals there should be 618 bed closures by 2017 – 15 per cent of the current total			1
this includes 173 at @entity138 and 224 at @entity140 ’s and @entity139			0
however , a spokeswoman for @entity140 ’s and @entity142 ’ denied there were any plans to close beds			2
documents from a consultation in @entity148 , @entity149 , show similar plans			1
the ‘ pre-consultation business case ’ says : ‘ @entity153 beds required by the population of @entity148 are reduced and those beds are replaced by the extended supported care in the community			1
’ at @entity159 in @entity121 , bed numbers are forecast to drop by 21 per cent by 2016 - 17			1
elsewhere in the trust , @entity153 will lose 72 beds and @entity162 138			2
@entity163 , a nurse and @entity165 representative from @entity166 , said plans to reorganise health services in @entity149 would also include bed losses , despite the public consultation literature failing to explicitly mention such changes			1
she said : ‘ they ’re saying 25 per cent of people in hospital do not need to be treated in hospital			1
it ’s all about affordability , and it ’s shocking			0
’ shadow health secretary @entity179 said : ‘ this reveals the full extent of the risks being taken with patient care			2
hospitals are sailing dangerously close to the wind			0
ministers must take urgent action to ensure patient safety			0
’ @entity189 , chief executive of the @entity190 , said : ‘ changes should happen with patients , not simply to patients			0
the government ’s decision to drive through £ 20 billion of @entity6 savings is having a real impact on care			0
’ a spokesman for @entity53 denied the figures had been ‘ hidden ’ , adding : ‘ the figures are all given in the document and explained in detail in the appendix			2
we have published all these figures on beds in 73,000 distributed copies of our consultation plan – to which we received over 17,000 responses			2
modern health care means people can be better supported at home			0
’ a spokesman for the health for @entity91 consultation , representing @entity217 , said the bed losses could be revised lower but ‘ significant reductions ’ were planned			1
he said : ‘ these relate to efficiency gains			0
they are not a consequence of the @entity21 changes			0
the trust needs to bring itself back into financial balance and in line with national benchmarking around length of stay			0

some areas could see the number of hospital beds cut by 25 per cent
the plans suggest @entity23 playing a larger role providing care in the community
the number of patients treated in hospital will be restricted , with care *increasingly* provided by *gps* or other services in the community .
in @entity91 , almost *800* beds – one in four – could be lost across nine hospitals .
@entity217 in @entity252 , @entity253 , could see its capacity cut from *387* beds to just *47* in a few years .
in @entity121 , 618 beds are to be scrapped across seven hospitals over the next five years .
there are also plans to slash beds in other parts of @entity53 and @entity149 , but the scale of these cuts is yet to be revealed . there are likely to be similar reductions in bed numbers across the @entity268 .
