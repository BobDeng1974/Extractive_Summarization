by @entity0 a talented @entity2 designer has created an amazing table that also doubles as a home for your pet canaries			0
the @entity7 , now on display at the @entity9 in @entity10 , was created by @entity11 , who told @entity12 that it was designed to ' break convention '			1
he added : ' the idea was to develop a cage as break from conventional codes and ensure the integration of a habitat as if in a mixing bowl			0
theatrical : the @entity22 is intended to bring a sense of the theatrical to table design no need for flowers ! the @entity7 has tabletop decoration covered thanks to its bell jars ' the connection between the cage and glass bells refers to the stuffed birds who live there , as well as a nod to cabinets of curiosities			1
' the bird cages are designed to look like glass bells as a nod to the idea of stuffed birds or taxidermy			2
' he went on : ' the bird is staged as if in a theatre			0
it gives the traditional table a theatrical aspect and is an homage to curiosity cabinets			1
' the table itself consists of a sleekly modernist pine top , with a delicate white - painted cage beneath and three glass bells on top			0
curiosities : according to @entity11 , the design was inspired by nature and curiosity cabinets clever : from below , the incredible attention to detail and cleverly worked branches are revealed inside the cage are three stuffed orange birds , although there 's nothing to stop buyers from introducing real ones - provided they are n't worried about the mess			1
the stunning photos of the @entity7 were shot by @entity77 , an up - and - coming photographer who specialises in design			2
@entity11 , who adds on his website that the table represents an ' idealised vision of nature ' is no stranger to work that pushes the boundaries			1
other striking efforts include the @entity87 , a bookcase designed to resemble a set of stairs and @entity91 , a stunning blown glass and steel lamp that looks like a tiny hot air balloon			2
another interesting piece is the @entity96 , a delicate leather stool that resembles an upended thimble			0
