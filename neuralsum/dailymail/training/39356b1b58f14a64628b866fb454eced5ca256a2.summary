captain @entity0 insists @entity1 have not been derailed in their latest @entity3 quest			1
the @entity5 winners are facing a familiar battle to qualify for the knockout stages of @entity9 's elite competition after an unimpressive 1 - 1 draw with @entity11 on tuesday			1
the result left @entity14 's men with just one point from their opening two @entity17 games and already trailing leaders @entity18 by five points			2
@entity0 remains confident @entity1 can still progress from their @entity3 group @entity22 scored @entity11 's equaliser at the @entity24 on tuesday to secure an away draw for the @entity26 they must now make some headway in their next two fixtures , back - to - back away and home games against @entity31 , to put pressure on the @entity33 and @entity26			1
this is @entity1 's fourth season in a competition they are still to make a genuine impact in , but @entity0 is confident in the team 's quality			1
the @entity40 defender said : ' it wo n't set us back			0
it wo n't affect us			0
we will deal with it			0
it gives you a feeling to get back out there and show everyone how good we are			0
' i do n't think it affects it ( the group ) too much			0
@entity11 have still got to play twice against @entity18			2
' we will go out there and play as we always do , to win			0
it does n't change much for us			0
we will play every game from here to the end to win , thinking we can get three points out of it			0
' @entity1 failed to get out of their group in both 2011 - 12 and 2012 - 13 , performances which contributed to the departure of former manager @entity64			1
some progress was made last season as @entity14 took @entity1 to the last - 16 stage for the first time but they were unable to get past @entity69			1
@entity0 believes @entity1 will ' deal with ' the draw and it ' will not affect ' the players in the rest of the campaign this season , with the @entity5 title reclaimed , the expectations on @entity1 to perform in @entity9 , from inside and outside the club , were greater			1
@entity0 accepts the team have not yet done themselves justice			2
the 28 - year - old said : ' at the moment we all acknowledge that we could play better			0
' but we are absolutely convinced that with @entity11 away , @entity18 at home , and the two @entity86 games , if we play as well as we can , we should be looking for three points			1
' @entity1 were outplayed for large spells of their opening game at @entity18 but were unfortunate to lose to a deflected 89th - minute goal from @entity91			1
but back at the @entity24 , fortune perhaps helped them against @entity11 as the @entity94 side dominated			1
@entity95 did give @entity1 the lead with a fourth - minute penalty but a @entity11 side boasting former @entity100 defender @entity99 then pegged them back with slick , incisive attacking play			1
@entity95 ( right ) had put @entity1 ahead from the penalty spot before @entity22 's equaliser on tuesday night their 23rd - minute equaliser through @entity22 , after @entity105 had earlier hit the bar , was not only brilliantly taken but thoroughly deserved			1
@entity11 had numerous other chances , notably through the impressive @entity108 , but could not force their way in front			1
@entity1 did finish well but @entity111 was caught narrowly offside and @entity112 twice missed the target			2
@entity0 said : ' we did n't play as well as we could , definitely			2
you just have to look at these games sometimes and say , ' it 's a point '			0
' but this is the @entity3 , and if you do n't perform , you should n't expect more from it			2
' it was n't our best performance apart from the spell towards the end			0
' we could n't even hold on to the lead - it was just not our best performance			0
but there is still a lot to play for			0
i think we can get a good share of those 12 remaining points			0
' @entity14 watched his side pick up their first point of the group stage and they face an uphill battle			2

@entity0 is confident @entity1 will progress from group
@entity5 champions drew 1 - 1 at home against @entity11 on tuesday
@entity1 now have an uphill task to progress further in @entity3
but @entity0 says the result ' will not affect ' players and will still aim to win
back - to - back @entity31 matches are now *key* to @entity1 's chances
