@entity3 , from @entity50 , was affiliated to the notorious @entity52 gang and went by the street name @entity54			1
a petty squabble over a girl is thought to have started the row			1
judge @entity58 said today : ' the veil of silence that has fallen over the main participants in this case speaks volumes as to the cowardice and moral bankruptcy of those on both sides of this argument			1
' carrying knives , at least three on each side , is a comparatively modern phenomenon , which is approaching an endemic state among feckless , aimless youths who think nothing of wielding and using of knives in the face of the slightest provocation or perceived insult			2
' brutal : ( from left ) @entity25 , 18 , @entity24 , 25 , and @entity26 , 31 , all denied murder and violent disorder but were convicted at the @entity29 today vicious : @entity23 , 21 , denied murder but admitted violent disorder			2

' we are still none the wiser as to the cause , and whether of not it has to do with gang violence ' , he said			0
' whether there was rivalry , whether there was loyalty , whether it was revenge for a previous incident , i do n't know			0
' the @entity29 trial heard simmering tensions between two rival factions threatened to boil over at a 23rd birthday party at the 150 - capacity venue , behind a converted shopfront			1
' one group went into the rear garden to smoke a couple of times and whenever they returned , things appear to get either tenser or the atmosphere a little more strained ' , said @entity120 , prosecuting			0
the situation came to a head at around 4am , when @entity3 and five friends returned from the smoking area			1
' the group was making its way back from the garden and was blocking the area between the entrance and the main room , ' said mr @entity131			0
' there was a confrontation and knives were brandished			0
people were pushing and @entity3 ran to the exit			1
' gang warfare : the @entity29 heard that it is thought that violence flared at the 23rd birthday party after derogatory comments were made about a girl @entity3 was stabbed inside the club during a mass brawl , which spilled outside as gang members armed themselves with @entity146 and @entity147 brandy bottles from behind the bar			1

he was taken to the @entity155 in @entity156 , but was pronounced dead			0
one of the wounds he received had pierced his lung			0
' to say those originally in the dock did not know who inflicted the fatal injuries is nonsense ' , said judge @entity94			2
' that , of course , is a secret they are not going to divulge			0
' he also criticised @entity3 's friends who were with him that night for refusing to testify in court or help police investigate the murder			1
' witness after witness , with one solitary exception , lacked the necessary courage to advance the truth ' , he said			0
' the victim 's best friend declined to name those who stabbed @entity3 in the car park			1
' his attitude as the best friend of the victim is made clear in his statement , where he says , if forced to go to court , i shall be rude and disruptive			2
' the judge identified @entity23 and @entity24 as ringleaders in the attack , while @entity25 joined in the violence outside the club			2
he said all three carried knives			0
@entity26 , he said , probably joined in the attack out of loyalty to others rather than any direct involvement			0
