along with selfie and twerking , contouring was one of 2014 's buzzwords - and it 's all thanks to @entity6			1
the selfie - loving beauty buff well and truly put contouring - a laborious method of applying your make - up to enhance your features - on the map			1
but is it possible to get @entity6 's flawless look without a professional make - up artist and hours of brush strokes ? @entity17 was keen to find out			1
as @entity28 launch the first - ever make - up range designed specifically for contouring , @entity17 attempted to emulate their favourite stars @entity30 - the beauty brand fronted by @entity32 - this year launched the first - ever contouring range of make - up			1
from the £ 52 illuminating powder to the £ 34 eye sculpt , each of the new products have been designed to contour and sculpt your face			2
the brand 's team of experts are also on hand at the @entity46 's debut sculpting bar in @entity47 , @entity48 , to help you create a flawless @entity50 look			1
ahead of party season , three @entity17 writers attempted to emulate their favourite contoured celebrities using the innovative new products			1
so how did they get on ? before and after : @entity56 , 30 , was a little unnerved at the amount of make - up on her face but she did get quite a few compliments about her appearance from friends who saw her look in party pictures @entity56 , 30 , has never been an avid make - up user ; she had never even used a brow pencil before			1
she loved brand ambassador @entity32 's sculpted look though , so decided to test it out for herself with the help of the sculpting team			1
speaking ahead of her makeover , @entity56 said : ' i do n't tend to wear a lot of make - up			1
@entity74 i use touche eclat , mascara , eye pencil and blusher , then for a party look i just add some bright red lipstick			2
' but i was willing to put up with multiple layers of slap if it magically transformed me into @entity32			0
' also keen to give the product range a run for its money was @entity87 , 37			2
she said : ' i 'm fascinated by the way celebrities like @entity90 and @entity6 create the illusion of more prominent cheekbones , a straighter nose and bigger eyes through make - up techniques alone			1
' i wear make - up regularly but only @entity97 bb cream , @entity98 on my cheeks , @entity101 mascara and some tinted lip balm			1
' with a @entity104 party to go to , i was more than willing to give contouring a try - especially if there was a chance it would give me @entity90 's bone structure for the night			1
' @entity108 , 25 , already wears a fair amount of make - up so was n't expecting staggering results			1
she was , however , keen to learn how to contour and apply her make - up more naturally , without the dreaded orange face , white neck scenario that her brother so kindly always points out			1
the team used their arsenal of products to transform the writers			2
so how does the range , which comes with big claims , work ? watch out , @entity90 ! @entity87 said she wanted to see if @entity30 's contouring make - up could give her the illusion of cheekbones and a bronzed glow , like @entity90 who favours the brand the powders are opalescent , which is apparently designed to highlight facial features with an illuminating gleam , and the universal @entity132 tone aims to add a candle - lit glow to the skin			1
the powders have micronisation technology and fine pearls in the formula , which apparently give the skin a silky texture and ensures even application			0
the eye products have been made with a mousse - like texture , which , say the makers , can help enhance features as well as be built up to create a more contoured look			2
there 's also a £ 24 tinted cream that is filled with hyaluronic acid , which promises to plump skin			0
@entity56 was impressed , if a little scared of her final look			0
she said : ' i got a bit of a shock when i looked in the mirror , there was such an extreme amount of make - up on my face and i did actually rub off some of the shading on my cheekbones			1
' it was way too much for me to feel comfortable and i was very aware of it throughout the evening , but saying that , about five of my friends got in contact to say how good i looked in @entity165 pictures the next day			0
' so it did work - but mainly if you 're the kind of person who cares more about what you look like in pictures than in real life			2
' it clearly did something though , because looking at my " after " photo , i am posing like a total diva			0
' @entity87 was equally impressed			0
' i could feel the make - up artist applying a serious amount of product to my face and eyes but i was still surprised to see how bronzed and smoky - eyed i looked in the mirror			1
' in the atmospheric lighting at my bash , i received a lot of compliments but under the harsh lights of the ladies ' loo , my orange cheeks gave me flashbacks to the " you 've been tangoed " ads from the @entity194			0
' however , i loved my eyes and would never have dared to take my make - up so far on my own			1
plus in photographs my usually pasty face appeared to have more colour and definition			0
no wonder celebrities swear by the stuff on the red carpet			0
' @entity108 did n't notice a huge difference from her normal daytime look but was impressed by the long - lasting formulations and liked the colour it gave her face			2
get the look : the powders , as tested by @entity108 , have micronisation technology and fine pearls in the formula , which apparently gives the skin a silky texture and ensures even application prep skin with a device such as the @entity221 , which promises to instantly revitalise the skin by boosting the collagen levels , creating a fresh plumped base , for expert contouring			2
gently massage primer into the skin , this cooling gel will relax and reduce redness , plump the skin and diffuse fine lines , leaving a radiant finish on the skin			0
this will help protect your skin and hold your make - up			1
to even skin tone and add luminosity apply your @entity237 tint			0
buff into the skin using your foundation brush for even , natural and polished coverage			0
take your retouch pen and use to brighten and lift shadow from around the eyes and diffuse fine lines , use the brush to dot straight from the pen into crows ' feet , deep frown lines , the folds around the mouth and blend gently with your finger to lift shadow			0
use a highlighter to create instant definition and accentuate features , dot , and blend along the cheekbones to define , the inner corner of the eye to wake up and open the eyes , the brow bone to give an instant brow lift effect and the bridge of the nose and cupids bow to highlight and define			0
to create natural structure and sculpt your face shape , simply take your contour brush and @entity28 deluxe contour powder , and sweep under the cheekbone to create a natural shadow and strengthen your natural structure , to find exactly where to place this , suck in your cheeks to discover where the natural shadow forms			1

accentuate cheekbones and add radiance with your an illuminating powder , sweep across the collar bone with your powder brush to define and add a candlelit sheen			0
add a natural sun - kissed warmth to the skin by applying bronzing powder with your powder brush to the forehead , temples , cheekbones , tip of the nose and chest for and even , enhanced glow , add that perfect healthy pinched cheek by gently blending the hyaluronic cheek sculpt gently into the apples of your cheeks			2
define your eyes and brows using the eye sculpt with the eye smudge brush			0
sweep it onto the lid and blend with your little finger into your socket line ( you can find this by simply opening your eyes and finding the natural crease above the eyeball )			0
use the smudge brush to blend it into the bottom lash line - this will give a modern soft smokey effect			2
create a modern brow by using the smudge brush to buff eye sculpt into the fine hairs of your brows onto the skin beneath , this will naturally define , strengthen and add fullness to your brows			0
finish off with mascara for perfectly defined , fluttery , natural lashes			0
