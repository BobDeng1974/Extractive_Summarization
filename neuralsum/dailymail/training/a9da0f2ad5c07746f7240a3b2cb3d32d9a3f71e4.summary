by @entity0 published : 03:58 est , 27 february 2013 updated : 06:40 est , 27 february 2013 costly : @entity2 in @entity3 , which will cost taxpayers £ 700,000 - a - year for 30 years - even though it is closed to the public a state - of - the - art police station is to cost taxpayers a total of £ 21million over the next 30 years , even though it is closed to the public			1
the front desk at the station , which opened 11 years ago in a 30 - year private finance deal , is shut to save costs , and has been replaced by a mobile police van in the car park for eight - hours - a - week			1
but police are still committed to handing over £ 700,000 - a - year for the station at @entity2 , @entity18 , @entity3 , in the finance deal until 2031			1
the total cost for the building , which provides a home for the force 's hi - tech @entity23 and the @entity25 for the @entity27 area , will be £ 21m - almost 10 times the cost of building the station			1
acting chief constable @entity30 admitted the @entity2 station is ' too costly ' and ' does not provide the public with value for money '			2
and @entity33 , police and crime commissioner in @entity35 , said : ' what we 've ended up with somehow is a state - of - the - art police station in the wrong place for the wrong price ' i 've inherited it and i know it 's very expensive and it takes up a lot of my estates budget			2
' it 's deeply disappointing and particularly frustrating when obviously the police service is facing tough financial times as many public services are			0
' we have this contract that we appear to be tied into that does cost us a lot of money			0
' the police station was built in a private finance initiative deal between the former @entity58 and local building firm @entity59 , whose own offices are next door to the police station			1
under the terms of the agreement , approved by the @entity67 , @entity64 used a bank loan to build the station for around £ 2.7m			0
the force then agreed to pay an annual fee to use the building and to pay for its maintenance after it opened in 2001			2
according to @entity67 figures @entity58 agreed to hand over £ 700,000 - a - year for the building for 30 years			1
closed : the front desk at the station has been shut to save costs and replaced by a mobile police van in the car park for eight hours a week the police station is costing 18 per cent of the force 's entire estates budget			1
acting chief constable miss @entity30 said : ' in recent years my predecessor met with the contractors in an effort to renegotiate the terms of the contract			0
' however , this proved unsuccessful and currently there is no basis upon which we can seek to vary the terms of the contract in the absence of the agreement of the contractors			0
' a spokesman for builders @entity64 said : ' the police set the terms of the contract			0
there is bank funding and it is not easy to renegotiate the deal			0
' a @entity67 spokesman said : ' the funding for this @entity110 was agreed under a previous administration following an application by @entity58			0
' deal : the police station was built in a private finance initiative deal between the former @entity58 and local building firm @entity59 ( pictured ) , which is based next to the station @entity118 , chief executive of @entity119 said : ' badly negotiated @entity110 deals from the early 2000s have already cost taxpayers billions and this is yet another example of a contract for which we will bear the cost for decades to come			1
' there is nothing wrong with the principle of @entity110 , which brings in private sector expertise and transfers some of the risks ; but too many @entity110 deals have left a scandalous legacy and been used to shift debts off the public sector balance sheet and conceal growing debts that taxpayers will be paying for decades to come			2
' it is crucial that politicians secure a better deal for taxpayers in future			0
