campaign spokesman @entity239 said : ' the only thing shocking about this is that they apparently think it ’s wrong to suggest that we should help returning veterans , children leaving foster care and other members of @entity31 ’s 47 per cent get training that will allow them to find the best available jobs			2
' if the @entity31 campaign believes that @entity83 will accept these desperate attacks tomorrow night in place of specific plans for the middle - class , it ’s they who are in for a surprise			2
