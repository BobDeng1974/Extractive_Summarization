researchers found regular meditation can relieve anxiety , pain and stress as well as traditional anti-depressants meditation for just half an hour can relieve depression as much as popping a pill , claim researchers			1
they found regular meditation could also relieve anxiety , pain and stress			1
in a @entity15 study of previously published research involving 3,500 people , meditation alleviated symptoms of depression on a par with conventional anti-depressants			1
meditation , which has a long history in eastern traditions , is one of many ' mindfulness ' techniques that have grown in popularity in the @entity28 over the last 30 years			1
it is typically practised for 30 to 40 minutes a day with the aim of encouraging acceptance of feelings and thoughts without judgment , and relaxing body and mind			0
study leader dr @entity37 , an assistant professor at @entity38 , @entity39 , said ' a lot of people have this idea that meditation means sitting down and doing nothing			1
' but that 's not true			0
meditation is an active training of the mind to increase awareness , and different meditation programmes approach this in different ways			1
' he said thousands of people use meditation for stress busting and personal growth , ' but it 's not a practice considered part of mainstream medical therapy for anything			1
' he said ' in our study , meditation appeared to provide as much relief from some anxiety and depression symptoms as what other studies have found from antidepressants			1
' these patients did not typically have full - blown anxiety or depression			0
' overall , depression affects one in 10 adults in the @entity76 at any one time			0
there has been a big rise in the use of antidepressants in the last 20 years , particularly among women , with prescriptions in @entity83 reaching a record 50 million in 2012			0
@entity85 guidelines recommend talking therapies , including cognitive behavioural therapy ( @entity88 ) , in preference to drugs for people with mild to moderate depression			2
studies show psychological therapies can be as effective as drugs in tackling common mental health problems , and are often more successful in the long term			0
the latest study focused on 47 clinical trials performed up until june 2013 among 3,515 participants that involved meditation and various mental and physical health issues , including depression , anxiety , stress , insomnia , substance use , diabetes , heart disease , cancer and chronic pain			1
studies show psychological therapies can be as effective as drugs in tackling common mental health problems , and are often more successful in the long term the researchers evaluated the degree to which those symptoms changed in people with a variety of medical conditions , although only a minority had been diagnosed with a mental illness			2
they found moderate evidence of improvement in symptoms of anxiety , depression and pain after participants underwent what was typically an eight - week training programme in mindfulness meditation			1
for example , the ' effect size ' for the reduction in depression levels was 0.3 , which is what would be expected from using an anti-depressant ' but without the associated toxicities '			0
there was some ' low ' evidence of improvement in stress and quality of life , says a report in @entity147 ( must credit )			0
there was not enough information to determine whether other areas - positive mood , attention , substance use , eating habits , sleep and weight - could be improved by meditation			2
in the studies that followed participants for six months , the improvements typically continued			0
no harm came from meditation , said the researchers			2
prof @entity37 said there were weaknesses in the analysed trials and further studies are needed to clarify which outcomes are most affected by these meditation programmes , as well as whether doing more meditation would have greater benefits			2
however , he said , there was clear evidence that meditation was not simply a ' placebo effect ' - whereby the patient experiences an improvement in symptoms without being actively treated simply because they expect to			0
' meditation programmes appear to have an effect above and beyond the placebo			0
' clinicians should be prepared to talk with their patients about the role that a meditation programme could have in addressing psychological stress			0
' stronger study designs are needed to determine the effects of meditation programmes in improving the positive dimensions of mental health and stress - related behaviour ' he added .			1
