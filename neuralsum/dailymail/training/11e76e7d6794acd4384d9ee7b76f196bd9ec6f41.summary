@entity8 lawyer @entity64 told the jury in the trial , which kicked off two weeks ago in @entity3 , the deal @entity9 put together was ' secretly designed to maximize the potential it would fail ' to the benefit of the hedge fund			1
' in the end , @entity73 greed drove mr. @entity9 to lie and deceive , ' @entity64 said			1
on the witness stand , the @entity8 lawyers confronted @entity9 with a january 2007 email it said deliberately misled another institutional investor about @entity16 's short position in the investment called @entity5			1
asked repeatedly if the information in the email was ' false , ' @entity9 responded , ' it was not accurate			1
' under fire : @entity9 ( 3rd from l ) , is shown in this courtroom sketch in @entity31 federal court he added : ' i was n't trying to confuse anybody ; it just was n't accurate at the time			1

the civil case had been called the most significant legal action related to the mortgage securities meltdown , but it lacked the drama and high stakes of white - collar criminal cases			0
much of the testimony was devoted to the intricacies of synthetic collateralized debt obligations , or @entity136 - a complex type of investment central to the case			0
some of the testimony focused on a personal email @entity9 sent to his girlfriend in @entity19			2
bourgeoisie : @entity9 reportedly ' loved to party ' and claimed to be from a prominent @entity19 family the @entity8 lawyers said the missive proved the hubris of a man at the center of a massive fraud , while the defense claimed was " an old - fashioned love letter " penned by a young trader who was full of self - doubt and angst over upheaval in the financial world			1
writing in @entity19 , @entity9 said of the financial markets : ' the whole building is about to collapse anytime now			2
' ' only potential survivor , the fabulous fab ... standing in the middle of all these complex , highly leveraged , exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all of the implications of those monstrosities ! ! !
