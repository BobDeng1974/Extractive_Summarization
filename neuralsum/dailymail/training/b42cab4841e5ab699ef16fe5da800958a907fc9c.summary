by @entity0 last updated at 8:34 pm on 28th february 2012 whereas some of us might moan about our commute taking up a few hours of every day , spare a thought for those who make astonishing journeys across hundreds of miles just to get to work			0
the ‘ super-commuter ’ , who works in one city but lives in another , is on the rise in the @entity8 and especially in @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11 , where they make up 13 per cent of the workforce			1
they are followed by @entity19 , @entity20 ; @entity21 , @entity22 ; and @entity23 , @entity24 , which all have seven to eight per cent of their workforce based outside the city ’s statistical area			1
changing patterns : the ' super-commuter ' , who works in one city but lives in another , is on the rise in the @entity8 and especially in @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11 , where they make up 13 per cent of the workforce			1
the stars in this diagram represent major cities and the circle sizes represent other cities where the workforce comes from @entity40 : the report found @entity8 super-commuters tend to be aged less than 29 years old and while ' twin cities ' in the past were typically 40 miles apart they can now be up to 200 miles apart			1
the circles represent other cities from which people commute into @entity48 , and their size shows the rise in local long - distance commuters @entity52 : around 10,000 workers travel 400 miles south from @entity54 to the famous @entity56 city @entity57 , 56 , of @entity58 , right , makes the 600 - mile $ 130 round trip to @entity23 every week			1
he gets a 7:20am flight to @entity24 on monday and is home in @entity62 by 7:30pm on friday			0
his plane ticket cost will soon go up to $ 220			0
the father works for food services company @entity65 and drives or takes the train to and from his sister ’s house in @entity70 , @entity71 , during the week - a journey which takes an hour			2
he once had a 30 - minute drive to work for financial firm @entity75 in @entity58 before he lost his job , failed to find work locally and decided to take the @entity23 job a year ago			2
‘ the super-commuter typically travels once or twice weekly for work , and is a rapidly growing part of our workforce , ’ wrote the authors of a @entity81 report released last week			0
they cite changing advances in wireless technology as one major reason for this shift , with many employees working on their way to and from work , and living in cheaper areas to their office ’s city			0
in addition many qualified workers do n’t want to sell their homes and move if they are offered a new job - but do want to take the employment offer with the jobless rate still at 8.3 per cent in the @entity8 ‘ the global economy has rendered the clock irrelevant , ’ the @entity103 report said			2
‘ the workplace is no longer fixed in one location , but rather where the worker is situated			0
’ areas where workers in one city live have expanded to other cities and metropolitan areas often hundreds of miles apart , which is resulting in greater economic integration , the report said			2
this is seen for example in @entity52 , @entity56 , where 10,000 workers travel 400 miles from @entity54 - and in @entity121 , @entity122 , where 5,000 workers travel 300 miles from @entity124 , @entity125			1
super-commutes from @entity10 to @entity9 in @entity11 had more than tripled in 2009 compared to 2002 , and they had doubled between @entity56 and @entity52 , as well as from @entity58 , @entity62 , to @entity48 , @entity40			1
@entity127 runs an astonishing 25 flights a day on the 240 - mile route between @entity9 and @entity10 , which is effectively a bus service shipping commuters across @entity11 , reported @entity132			1
the report found @entity8 super-commuters tend to be aged less than 29 years old and while ‘ twin cities ’ in the past were typically 40 miles apart they can now stretch up to 200 miles away from each other			0
transport methods : super-commuters travel up , down and across the @entity8 between cities by car , plane and train to get to work each week do you have a commute to work that could even rival that of @entity57 ? leave the details of your weekly journey below in the comments section ...			0

13 *%* of @entity9 *&* @entity10 workforce live outside of city statistical area ; *similar* situation in @entity19 and @entity21
big rise in long - distance commuting from @entity56 to @entity52 and from @entity58 to @entity40
workers do *n't* want to sell home but look elsewhere for jobs *due* to low house prices and high *unemployment*
