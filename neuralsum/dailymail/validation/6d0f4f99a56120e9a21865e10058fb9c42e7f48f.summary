@entity0 has warned @entity1 not to repeat the mistakes of 2007 when chasing @entity4 glory in @entity5 this weekend			1
@entity0 watched in horror as @entity1 chased a points - difference boosting final try rather than punt the ball out for full - time in @entity10 eight years ago , only to concede a pivotal converted score			1
@entity12 plundered the last - gasp score for the @entity14 , with @entity1 winning out 54 - 21 : @entity15 then hammered @entity16 46 - 19 to swipe the title on points - difference - by just a four - point margin			1
the @entity1 squad warm up ahead of training on thursday , with @entity22 ( centre ) involved again @entity24 ( left ) and @entity25 ( right ) arrive at training ahead of the crucial game against @entity16 @entity1 coach @entity0 has urged his team not to repeat the mistakes of 2007 , when he was involved @entity0 has moved from flanker in 2007 to forwards coach in 2015 - but knows @entity1 face a similar situation and is wary of the pitfalls of chasing glory rather than focusing on victory			1
@entity1 can still retain their @entity4 title with victory in @entity5 on saturday			2
@entity39 's @entity38 clash with @entity15 kicks off last though , and @entity0 is keen to avoid any repeat of that 2007 pain			1
' it is exactly that , you 've got to focus on what you can do in that 80 minutes , ' said @entity0 , recalling @entity1 's aborted 2007 title challenge			1
' we 've got to focus on what we can produce in @entity48			0
' the performance first and foremost will give us the right result and what goes outside of our environment in @entity53 and @entity54 is exactly that , outside our control and we ca n't factor that into what we 're doing in the 80 minutes against @entity16			0
@entity58 flicks a pass out the back of his hand as @entity1 prepared for their vital final game @entity63 receives a massage on the training pitch as @entity1 prepared for their @entity5 showdown ' they are going to make it difficult enough as it is without us focusing on what else is going on elsewhere			1
we 've got to focus on our job and make sure that is right and hopefully that puts us in the best possible position come saturday evening			0
' @entity39 were forced to watch television in frustration last year as @entity1 claimed the @entity4 title with victory in @entity79 , but back in 2007 it was the @entity80 themselves who suffered that fate			1
@entity0 and company were forced to endure @entity15 stealing the 2007 title from under their noses , as @entity87 claimed the last - ditch try that sealed glory for @entity15			2
to add insult to injury , @entity87 's title - winning try was awarded by @entity94 television match official @entity93			1
@entity1 's players were understandably stony - faced when the reality of that 2007 situation hit home - but @entity0 has revealed this week that he has effectively shut that video nasty out of his mind			1
' i do n't recall that			0
i genuinely ca n't remember that			0
if you say i was there , i must have been but i do n't recall , ' said @entity0			2
@entity106 stretches during the session , as @entity0 urged his side to focus on wining the game @entity110 catches the ball , as @entity1 go into the game level on points with @entity39 and @entity114 ' i recall watching it together and the disappointment of not getting over the line			1
' we did our utmost in the game to give ourselves the best possible opportunity that year and we have to make sure we do the same this week			2
' rather than linger on the past @entity0 has instead backed the current @entity1 outfit to fix the white - line fever that blew a @entity124 in @entity114 last weekend			1
@entity0 threw his full support behind @entity1 's attack , despite several try - scoring chances going begging in saturday 's 32 - 16 defeat at the @entity129			2
replacement prop @entity110 knocked on with the line at his mercy after racing through the middle of a ruck in @entity134 , with @entity63 frustrated a gaping backline overlap went begging			0
asked how to solve the front - foot shortcomings , @entity0 replied : ' by backing the players to make the right calls at the right time			0
@entity140 trains at @entity141 in @entity142 as the @entity1 squad stepped up their preparation ' all the players are comfortable to catch and pass and make good decisions ; that 's the bottom line			2
' the players will always be backed to make decisions			0
' former @entity149 boss @entity0 insisted @entity1 's management will not lose any faith in their frontline stars , just because of defeat in @entity134			2
' they are more than capable of producing the right things at the right time and sometimes under a bit of pressure , when the opposition are making it awkward to do certain things , you are going to come up with a few errors , ' said @entity0			0
' it 's not for lack of quality of having the players who can see those things			0
' you have to make sure that they make the right decisions at the right time and we 'll back them as coaches to do so			0
' it is one decision of many in a game and sometimes you make the right one , sometimes you do n't			0
' that 's the pressure at this level			0

@entity1 lost out on championship on points difference eight years ago
@entity0 , a player then , urges side to focus on winning
@entity184 is now a coach with @entity1 , who can win this year 's title
