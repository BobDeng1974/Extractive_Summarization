by @entity0 and @entity1 published : 03:01 est , 22 may 2012 updated : 03:01 est , 22 may 2012 despairing killer : @entity3 , 41 , who threw his two children - 14 - month - old @entity5 and four - year - old @entity6 - off a balcony in @entity8 this is the @entity10 father who threw his two children to their deaths from his sixth - floor balcony and then leapt himself while in despair about losing his advertising job			1
@entity3 , 41 , was killed instantly and his 14 - month - old daughter @entity5 and four - year - old son @entity6 died in hospital following the plunge in @entity8			1
mr @entity3 had been unemployed for 18 months after the advertising firm where he worked was hit by the economic crisis			2
he had grown increasingly depressed as he struggled to find a new job , his neighbours in the northern @entity10 town said			0
his wife @entity27 was in the flat at the time and had been heard arguing with mr @entity3 before he grabbed @entity6 and @entity5			1
she was yesterday being treated for shock			0
later mr @entity3 's cousin @entity31 said : ‘ i ca n’t believe it			1
i knew he was n’t working but i did n’t think things were this bad			0
' what did the children have to do with this ? ' mr @entity3 , who had no history of violence nor a criminal record , is understood to have feared losing his wife and his home as the family 's situation worsened			1
a neighour , @entity45 , who witnessed the horror unfold , said she heard the screaming and then rushed down to the street to see what had happened			0
tragic : the body of @entity3 is taken away after he killed his two children and then himself in @entity8 when she saw the children , ' i felt i was still breathing			2
i tried to feel the heartbeat of the baby , but it was already very weak , ' she told the @entity60 di @entity59 newspaper			0
mr @entity3 's cousin @entity31 revealed that the man 's father had committed suicide a year ago by hanging himself			2
the tragedy is thought to be the latest in a string of suicides by people who have been hit by the downturn in the economy and the ongoing eurozone crisis which has increased unemployment			0
the case is also chilling echo of @entity75 @entity74 , 37 , who shoved his daughter @entity76 , two , and son @entity77 , six , off a hotel balcony in @entity79 after a row with his wife @entity81			2
sickening : @entity3 , whose body is seen being taken away in a coffin , lost his job 18 months ago , was said to be despairing about money when he threw his two children from a sixth floor balcony barely concealed : @entity3 's body covered by a blanket while police officers stand by it he and @entity76 survived with broken bones but tragic @entity77 died from head injuries after the fourth - floor death plunge in @entity94 in 2006			1
a coroner originally ruled @entity77 's death unlawful but this was overturned by the @entity98 because evidence suggesting @entity74 was insane at the time of the killing was ignored			0
madness : @entity3 , whose body was later shielded from view , has been arging with his wife before snapping height : the apartment block where the tragedy happened chilling echo : @entity74 , left , threw his son @entity77 and daughter @entity76 off a hotel balcony in @entity94 before leaping off after a row with his then wife @entity81 but a second inquest last november backed the original decision after hearing bombshell new testimony from a @entity118 forensic psychiatrist who claimed the father would not have been insane when he jumped			1
however , @entity74 has yet to face charges over the deaths .			0

@entity3 , 41 , pushed 14 - month - old @entity5 and @entity6 , four , to their deaths after row with wife
he then leaped while his wife and the children 's mother watched in horror
@entity133 died instantly but children perished in hospital
