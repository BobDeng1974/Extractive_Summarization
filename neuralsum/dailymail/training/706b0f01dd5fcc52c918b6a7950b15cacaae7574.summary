@entity0 has warned @entity1 he will demand full managerial control before committing his future to the @entity5 club			1
@entity6 agreed compensation with the @entity1 on thursday to take their manager to the championship			1
@entity0 , who caught the eye of the @entity13 club by leading @entity6 to promotion then to third in the @entity15 , has already held preliminary discussions with the @entity18 board and will resume them on friday			1
@entity0 will only take the @entity1 manager job if he is given full control but although it ’s widely anticipated that his move is a formality , the 33 - year - old insists no club in the land could tempt him if he is n’t afforded full scope to do his job			1
‘ what has to happen is , when we discuss things , i ’ve got to be happy with what the job description will be and what my role will be , in terms of how much power i ’ll have , ’ @entity0 said			1
‘ because here at @entity6 the bottom line is i ’ve got the decisions to make , i ’m the decision maker and whatever comes or goes is through me			1
’ asked about the increasing number of head - coach positions south of the border where player recruitment is done by someone else , @entity0 stated : ‘ that wo n’t be the case			2
the bottom line is , if i ’m a manager i ’ll manage			0
i ’m not going to be going for someone to tell me what to do — there ’s no point in me going if that ’ s the case			0
@entity57 resigned on monday after less than nine months in charge of the championship club ‘ my description of a manager — and this is nothing to do with @entity1 , just my description — is he is the guy that manages the team and any players that come or go			2
he ’s the guy that makes the decision whether they come or go			0
’ pressed if there was any suggestion that @entity1 were n’t looking for a traditional manager , @entity0 retorted : ‘ not so far , whether that ’s the case tomorrow ( friday ) , that ’s how it might not happen			1
‘ really tomorrow ( friday ) will determine what will happen one way or the other			0
‘ it ’s the full thing , the package has got to be right			2
i ’m not going to uproot my family and move down there for an extra 20 quid			0
‘ and i ’m not going to go down there to be dictated by someone else who will tell me what to do			0
’ the @entity6 manager , pictured during training on monday , is set to hold more talks with @entity1 on friday barring a remarkable turn of events , however , confirmation of @entity0 replacing @entity57 at @entity5 will come later today			1
@entity6 vice-chairman @entity92 believes @entity0 ’s move to a side sitting just out - with the @entity96 play - offs positions further enhances his club ’s reputation as a developer of people			1
‘ an amicable arrangement has been agreed and @entity0 can now go and discuss terms with them , ’ he said			1
‘ we are delighted for @entity0			2
he has been fantastic for us and is yet another @entity6 success story , whereby we have produced players , sports scientists , managers and coaches			2
‘ @entity0 is the latest one			2
we were lucky enough to have @entity110 , who became manager of the year , and had the chance to go to @entity113			0
@entity0 is set to leave his role as player manager at @entity6 , the club where he has been for nearly 10 years ‘ we also had @entity117 here , who is now assistant to @entity119 at @entity120 , and now @entity0 is the latest one			1
we wish him all the best			0
’ with @entity121 , who doubles as @entity6 ’ academy director and @entity123 2 , also expected to head south , @entity92 needs to find a temporary manager before the visit of @entity126 on monday			0
captain @entity127 has been tipped to fill that post but @entity92 refused to speculate on a full - time successor			0
‘ it ’s much too early to be thinking about a replacement , ’ he added			0
‘ @entity132 , the chairman , is on holiday and when he gets back and it settles down there are a few things we want to tweak within the set - up			0

@entity1 have agreed a compensation package with @entity6 for @entity0
