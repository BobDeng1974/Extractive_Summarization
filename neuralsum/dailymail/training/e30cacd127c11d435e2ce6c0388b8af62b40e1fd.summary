by @entity1 reporter published : 11:27 est , 27 march 2013 updated : 11:27 est , 27 march 2013 more than half of @entity4 's rivers and streams are now unable to support life after decades of pollution , it was revealed yesterday			1
the bulk of the damage has been done by agricultural fertilisers such as phosphorus and nitrogen washing from fields into waterways			0
in total , 55 per cent of rivers and streams were classified by the @entity19 as being ' poor ' , with only a fifth in good health			1
polluted : rivers such as the @entity23 are now largely lifeless thanks to farming the agency sampled nearly 2,000 locations in 2008 and 2009 - from rivers as large as the @entity23 to streams small enough for wading			2
the study found more than 55 per cent of them in poor condition , 23 per cent in fair shape , and 21 per cent in good biological health			0
the most widespread problem is high levels of nutrient pollution , caused by phosphorus and nitrogen washing into rivers and streams from farms , cities , and sewers			1
high levels of phosphorus - a common ingredient in detergents and fertilisers - are found in 40 per cent of rivers and streams			1
another major problem is over-development , as land clearing and building along waterways increases erosion and flooding , allowing more pollutants to enter waters			2
beautiful : but human activity on the @entity63 and elsewhere has done severe damage to the ecological diversity of @entity4 's waterways ' this new science shows that @entity4 's streams and rivers are under significant pressure , ' said @entity71 , from the @entity19 's water office			1
' we must continue to invest in protecting and restoring our nation 's streams and rivers as they are vital sources of our drinking water , provide many recreational opportunities , and play a critical role in the economy			2
' conditions are worse in the @entity83 , the report found			0
more than 70 per cent of streams and rivers from the @entity87 coast to the @entity89 coast are in poor shape			0
streams and rivers are healthiest in sparsely populated @entity94 mountain areas , where only 26 per cent were classified as in poor condition			0
the @entity19 also found some potential risks for human health			0
in 9 per cent of rivers and streams , bacteria exceeded thresholds thought to endanger health			0
the toxic chemical mercury was found in fish along 13,000 miles of streams at levels exceeding health - based standards			1
@entity109 can enter the environment from coal - burning power plants and from burning hazardous wastes			0
the @entity114 administration finalised regulations to control mercury pollution from coal - burning power plants for the first time in late 2011 .			1

pollution is *due* to fertiliser use and over-development
*harmful* levels of toxic mercury in fish from @entity4 rivers
