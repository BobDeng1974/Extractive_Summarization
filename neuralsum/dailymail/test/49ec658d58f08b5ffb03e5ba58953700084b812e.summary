the @entity0 experienced its hottest month of march since record - keeping began in 1880			1
there 's been no break from the globe 's record heat - the first three months of 2015 have all set new high temperature marks			1
last month 's average temperature soared to @entity7 ( 13.6 ° c ) , which is 1.5 ° f ( 0.85 ° c ) above the average for the 20th century			1
last month 's average temperature of 56.4 ° @entity11 ) was the hottest march on record , averaging 1.5 ° f ( 0.85 ° c ) above the average for the 20th century			1
this was the highest for march in the 1880 – 2015 record , surpassing the previous record of 2010 by @entity16 ( 0.05 ° c )			2
pictured is how the high temperatures affected different regions of the world the data , released today by the @entity22 ( @entity22 ) takes into account global averages across land and sea surfaces			2
it follows earlier announcements from @entity29 government scientists that 2014 was the hottest year in modern history			2
scientists warn that fossil fuel burning is pushing more greenhouse gas into the atmosphere , leading to increased temperatures , melting of polar ice and glaciers , and rising seas			1
' this was the highest for march in the 1880 - 2015 record , surpassing the previous record of 2010 by 0.09 ° @entity41 ) , ' said the report			1
the warmth was spread fairly evenly across the hemispheres			0
most land areas were warmer to much warmer than average , as shown by the @entity48 map on the right , with record warmth in parts of the western @entity29 and @entity52 , various regions in eastern @entity54 , parts of @entity56 and northwestern @entity57 , part of south central @entity59 , and an area of northeastern @entity61 @entity22 scientist @entity62 blames the heat on @entity64 and climate change			1
@entity64 is caused by a shift in the distribution of warm water in the @entity69			2
usually the wind blows strongly from east to west , due to the rotation of the @entity0 , causing water to pile up in the western part of the @entity69			0
this pulls up colder water from the deep ocean in the eastern @entity69			0
however , in an @entity64 , the winds pushing the water get weaker and cause the warmer water to shift back towards the east			1
this causes the eastern @entity69 to get warmer			0
but as the ocean temperature is linked to the wind currents , this causes the winds to grow weaker still and so the ocean grows warmer , meaning the @entity64 grows			2
this change in air and ocean currents around the equator can have a major impact on the weather patterns around the globe by creating pressure anomalies in the atmosphere			0
last month , the @entity22 now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance @entity64 will continue through the summer			1
for the first three months of the year , the average temperature worldwide was 1.48 ° f ( 0.82 ° c ) above the 20th - century average			1
that marked the highest ever recorded for that period , surpassing the previous record in 2002 by @entity16 ( 0.05 ° c )			0
also of concern was the finding that @entity106 sea ice was the lowest on record for march			0
' the average @entity106 sea ice extent for march was 430,000 square miles ( 7.2 percent ) below the 1981 – 2010 average , ' said the report			0
' this was the smallest march extent since records began in 1979			0
' @entity22 climate scientist @entity62 said 2015 probably will break 2014 's hottest year mark if conditions persist			0
the first three months of 2015 were nearly a tenth of a degree higher than the old record and four - tenths of a degree warmer than january through march of last year			1
much of the most abnormal heat has been in the @entity69 and places near it			0
seven western @entity29 states set records for their hottest first three months of the year , while @entity124 and @entity125 set records for the coldest start of a year			2
the northeastern @entity29 has been one of the few colder - than - normal spots on the globe with entire continents of @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity54 and @entity61 coming in solidly warmer than normal			0
@entity62 blames the record heat on a combination of @entity64 , a blob of record hot water in the @entity138 and human - caused climate change			1
last month , the @entity22 now predicts that there is now a 50 to 60 per cent chance @entity64 will continue through the summer			1
some meteorologists , however , have warned that this @entity64 could combine with another slow movement of water temperature in the @entity69 called the @entity145 ( @entity145 )			1
the @entity145 reached record levels in december last year and january this year , and should it stay strong , it may combine with @entity64 to increase global temperatures			1
the maps below represent rainfall per cent of normal ( left , using a base period of 1961 – 1990 ) and precipitation ( right , using the period of record )			0
as is typical , precipitation anomalies during march 2015 varied significantly around the world @entity156 , deputy director of @entity22 's @entity157 , said : ' based on the persistent observations of above - average sea surface temperatures across the western and central equatorial @entity69 and consistent pattern of sea level pressure , we can now say that @entity64 is here			1
' many climate prediction models show this weak @entity64 continuing into summer			0
' the arrival of this @entity64 is considered to be late after scientists last year predicted they were expecting one last year , but the conditions failed to materialise			1
@entity64 is one of the most powerful climate altering phenonoma on the planet			0
it is the result of the @entity64 , which is the cycle of warm and cold water across the @entity69			2
this cycle occurs at intervals of between two to seven years and can last for nine months to two years			0
when the ocean is warmer than average for seven to nine months , the @entity22 officially classes it as @entity64 conditions			2
record warm temperatures continued to dominate in the northeast @entity69 and were also notable in the southwest @entity69 and parts of the @entity106 to the north and northwest of @entity56			0
this graph shos the march average surface temperatures on ocean and land			0

world experience average temperatures of @entity7 ( 13.6 ° c ) last month - 1.5 ° f above average for the 20th century
first 3 months of 2015 have set new high temperature marks , and the trend could continue throughout the year
scientists warn fossil fuels are pushing greenhouse gas into the atmosphere , leading to increased temperatures
but @entity64 , a blob of record hot water in the @entity138 , could also be driving up temperatures
