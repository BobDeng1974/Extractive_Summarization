geologists in @entity1 have for the first time linked earthquakes in a geologic formation deep under the @entity5 to hydraulic fracturing , leading the state to issue new permit conditions in certain areas that are among the nation 's strictest			1
a state investigation of five small tremors last month in the @entity14 area , in the @entity5 foothills , found the injection of sand and water that accompanies hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , in the @entity21 may have increased pressure on a small , unknown fault , said @entity25 chief @entity24			1
he called the link ' probable '			0
while earlier studies had linked earthquakes in the same region to deep - injection wells used for disposal of fracking wastewater , this marks the first time tremors in the region have been tied directly to fracking , @entity24 said			1
the five seismic events in march could n't be easily felt by people			2
probable link : officials say a series of tremors in @entity14 , @entity1 last month were linked to @entity36 ( pictured , a brine injection well owned by @entity43 in 2011 ) balancing goals : officials say drilling in @entity1 's @entity21 shale region nearly doubled the output of oil and natural gas there since 2011 , but there are concerns fracking has been responsible for a series of small quakes in march ( pictured , a large drilling rig sits outside the @entity58 in 2011 ) the oil and gas drilling boom targets widely different rock formations around the nation , so the @entity1 findings may not have much relevance to other areas other than perhaps influencing public perception of fracking 's safety			1
the types of quakes connected to the industry are generally small and not easily felt , but the idea of human activity causing the earth to shake often does n't sit well			0
the state says the company that set off the @entity1 quakes was following rules and appeared to be using common practices			0
it just got unlucky , @entity24 said			0
@entity80 , associate executive director of the @entity81 , said state regulators across the nation will study the @entity1 case for any implications for the drilling industry			2
a consortium of states has already begun discussions			0
fracking involves pumping huge volumes of water , sand and chemicals underground to split open rocks to allow oil and gas to flow			1
improved technology has allowed energy companies to gain access to huge stores of natural gas but has raised widespread concerns that it might lead to groundwater contamination and earthquakes			2
on hold : this brine injection well owned by @entity43 in @entity14 ( pictured 2011 ) has halted operations after a series of small earthquakes hit the area a @entity21 government - funded report released in 2012 found that two worldwide instances of shaking can be attributed to actual extraction of oil and gas , as opposed to wastewater disposal in the ground - a magnitude - 2.8 quake in @entity120 and a magnitude - 2.3 quake in @entity122			1
later , the @entity125 government tied quakes in @entity128 's @entity127 between 2009 and 2011 to fracking			0
those led to stricter regulations , which news reports indicated had little effect on the pace or volume of drilling			0
but for the region encompassing @entity1 , @entity138 and @entity139 , where energy companies have drilled thousands of unconventional gas wells in recent years , it 's a first			0
the @entity21 lies beneath the better - known @entity142 , which is more easily accessible and is considered one of the world 's richest gas reserves			1
@entity146 , a former seismologist with the @entity147 , confirmed the finding is the first in the area to suggest a connection between the quakes and fracking			0
a deep - injection wastewater well in the same region of @entity1 was found to be the likely cause of a series of quakes in 2012			1
' no fracking ' : @entity161 rep. @entity160 participates in an anti-fracking rally outside of @entity163 on february 7 , 2012 , in @entity164 , @entity1 under @entity1 's new permit conditions , all new drilling sites within three miles of a known fault or seismic activity of 2.0 magnitude or higher will be conditioned on the installation of sensitive seismic - monitoring equipment			1
results will be directly available to regulators , @entity24 said , so the state is n't reliant on drilling operators providing the data voluntarily			0
if seismic activity of 1.0 magnitude or greater is felt , drilling will be paused for evaluation			1
if a link is found , the operation will be halted			0
' while we can never be 100 percent sure that drilling activities are connected to a seismic event , caution dictates that we take these new steps to protect human health , safety and the environment , ' said @entity192 , director of @entity1 's natural resources department			2
link : a state investigation into last month 's tremors found the injection of sand and water that accompanies fracking in the @entity21 ( pictured ) may have increased pressure on a small , unknown fault @entity1 has also imposed an indefinite drilling moratorium at the site of the march quakes			1
the state is allowing oil and gas extraction to continue at five existing wells at the site			2
such events linked to fracking are ' extremely rare ' , said @entity211 , a spokesman for the industry group @entity212 , who described the new rules as safeguards that will prevent similar future quakes in @entity1 .			0

geologists said hydraulic fracturing may have caused five tremors in @entity14 last month
fracking involves injecting sand , water and chemicals deep underground to release oil and gas
now , all new drilling sites near known faults must have seismic - monitoring equipment
