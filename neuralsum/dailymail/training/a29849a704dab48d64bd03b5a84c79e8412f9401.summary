by @entity0 and @entity1 @entity2 : 09:49 est , 29 december 2013 @entity3 : 10:42 est , 29 december 2013 a closeted gay student living in @entity6 , @entity4 has written a powerful essay , criticizing the town 's most famous residents - @entity11 star @entity10			1
@entity10 made headlines after issuing homophobic comments in a @entity15 article , at one point comparing gay sex to bestiality , which got him put on suspension by the @entity20			1
but the network announced yesterday that they would be reinstating @entity10 to the show , who so far has remained unapologetic about the comments			1
in an essay posted on @entity30 - @entity29 columnist @entity28 's blog , the communications student writes that @entity10 probably did n't mean to hurt anyone with his statements , he nonetheless created a hostile environment			1
' he encouraged - hopefully unintentionally - a two - week - long " fag bashing " in @entity6 and around the world			0
he made me feel unsafe in my own home			0
i ca n't count how many times i heard " faggot " over the @entity40 visit home			0
' hurtful words : a closeted gay student has come out to condemn @entity11 star @entity10 over his homophobic comments the author says he 's never met @entity46 but was raised by a man just like him , revealing that his father called him an asshole for coming out to his mother and told him that his boyfriend would never be welcomed at his house			1
' my @entity10 threatened my life because i had the audacity to be who i am , ' he wrote			2
like many southerners , the writer grew up in a religious family and always felt a deep connection to the @entity60			0
but when then he realized that people like @entity10 believed he had a ' second class soul ' and would n't be eligible for salvation because of who he loved			2
not accepted : in an anonymous essay posted on a @entity30 - @entity69 columnist 's blog , the student writes about what its like to grow up and live in the same community as @entity10 ( far right ) - surrounded by people who do n't accept gays he says the church gets closer to welcoming gay members every year but something always happens to bring back the worst in people			1
' one year it was @entity79 - a. this year it 's @entity10			2
' worse than not being accepted by his church is not being accepted by his own family			0
he says he came out to his parents but was told to keep it a secret from everyone they know : ' the family is n't ready to hear that , ' they said			0
people like @entity92 have come out to defend @entity10 , saying he should n't be persecuted for his beliefs but the writer points out a flaw with this reasoning			2
back in the game : @entity10 's views briefly got him suspended from the network but that ban was officially lifted yesterday and he will appear in future episodes of @entity11 ' you do n't know persecution until you 're a 12 - year - old boy sitting in a church pew when your preacher encourages everyone to vote to make gay marriage illegal because they think you do n't deserve the same joy of raising a family due to your depravity ... when you know that , then you can talk about persecution			1
' the writer ends the letter on a positive note , saying that though @entity10 's comments can cause homophobia to flare up in the south , he does n't let it discredit him			1
' my love is n't different			0
it is n't wrong because a man with a beard said so in a @entity15 article			0
and it 's not going away			0
