despite telling @entity52 she could n't afford it , he began dismantling the exterior of her home , ' stripping it to the asbestos ' , the court heard			2

after she alerted her ex-husband to what was going on , the workmen disappeared , the court heard			0
the rogue traders left their victims ' homes in disarray , but also left their fingerprints on a paint tin mr @entity48 said : ' they never came back but she had to call in builders to put right the guttering and fascia			0

' days later , a 67 - year - old who walks with a stick was followed to her @entity38 home by two men who offered to paint it for £ 40			1
she agreed , but was later asked for a further £ 1,200			0
mr @entity48 told the judge : ' it is clear she did not know what she was paying for and having taken £ 1,200 from her , they then turned their attention to the house itself			0
' she described @entity52 as being determined to take down her kitchen ceiling , telling her she had a water leak , then saying there would be a lot of rubbish to take away and charging her another £ 2,400			0
' when she said she did n't have it , on his suggestion she took out a loan from her bank but having then paid £ 3,600 he said he needed £ 3,000 more , which the bank refused to give her because her only income was a small pension			0
' the woman 's home was left with no ceiling and debris all over her kitchen , the court heard			0

mr @entity172 told the court that @entity19 's guilty pleas showed he was remorseful			2
