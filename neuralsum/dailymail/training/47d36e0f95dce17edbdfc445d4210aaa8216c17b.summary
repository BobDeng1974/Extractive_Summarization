research has revealed that bees living in city hives can not find enough flowers to feed on locally and can end up sick or starving to death			1
the scientists suggest people living in cities who want to help the bees should grow bee - friendly flowers instead of setting up hives for the insects			1
spurred on by widespread coverage of declining bee numbers , urban beekeeping has never been more popular , particularly in @entity11			0
but scientists at the @entity36 have warned the boom could be bad for honey bees and other flower - visiting insects as it risks overtaxing the available nectar and pollen supply , and potentially encourages the spread of diseases			1
professor @entity44 and dr @entity45 from the @entity46 ( @entity46 ) at the university , explored the trend and public perception of honey bee decline			2
they also looked at the various awareness campaigns that have called on the public to get involved and help the bees , in a study published in the biologist			0
the duo noted that most of the promotion of beekeeping is directed at urban areas , especially @entity11			0
data from @entity62 , a register of apiaries maintained by the @entity13 â€™s @entity65 , showed that in five years - from 2008 to 2013 - the number of beekeepers in @entity11 tripled from 464 to 1,237 and the number of hives doubled from 1,677 to more than 3,500			2
there are now approximately 10 hives in every square kilometre of @entity11 compared to one hive in the same area across @entity75 as a whole			0
data from @entity62 , a register of apiaries maintained by the @entity13 's @entity65 , showed that in five years - from 2008 to 2013 - the number of beekeepers in @entity11 tripled from 464 to 1,237 and the number of hives doubled from 1,677 to more than 3,500 the biologists said many restaurants , galleries , businesses and shops use rooftop hives as a means of visibly greening their business or as a team - building exercise for staff			2
professor @entity44 said : ' both honey bees and wild bees have been declining			2
although the causes are complex the most important one seems to be loss of flowers and habitat			0
' since @entity100 , the spread of intensive farming has greatly reduced areas rich in wildflowers , such as hay meadows			0
' in the @entity13 , 75 per cent of the total land is now agricultural , so the lack of flowers is a major problem for our bees			0
' he believes planting more flowers is a better way of helping the honey bees instead of building more hives			1
he said : ' if the problem is not enough flowers , increasing the number of hives risks making that problem worse			0
the honey bee ( pictured ) is just one of many insect species which feed on nectar and pollen			1
having a high density of honey bee hives in a city is not only bad for honey bees , but may also affect bumblebees and other species feeding on the same flowers , scientists warned ' the honey bee is just one of many insect species which feed on nectar and pollen			1
having a high density of honey bee hives is not only bad for honey bees , but may also affect bumblebees and other species feeding on the same flowers			1
' the scientists said that as the number of urban hives increases , there needs to be sufficient food and there may not be enough flowers in the parks situated in built - up areas			0
they believe the high colony density in @entity11 and an influx of inexperienced beekeepers also runs the risk of spreading certain honey bee diseases , especially @entity155 foulbrood , a highly contagious bacterial infection of honey bee larvae			1
the infection is rare in @entity13 , but a high density of hives managed by novice beekeepers creates a situation in which it could easily spread if it got started and the only ' cure ' is to burn hives , they warned			1
the researchers calculated each new hive in @entity11 would need the equivalent of one hectare of borage , a plant that attracts mainly honey bees , to live comfortably			2
a beekeeper is pictured on the roof of @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity11 co-author dr @entity45 said : ' our calculations indicate that each new hive placed in @entity11 would need the equivalent of one hectare of borage , a plant that attracts mainly honey bees , or over eight hectares of lavender , a plant that attracts mainly bumblebees but some honey bees			2
' ' we need to bear in mind that the honey bee may have declined but is in no imminent danger of extinction , unlike some other critically endangered insects in the @entity13			1
' there are better ways to help our declining honeybee population than encouraging beekeeping to the point of overstocking certain areas			0
' she said : ' rather than encouraging more hives , a better alternative would be to translate the concern that people have for bees by providing more flowers and habitat			0
' professor @entity44 said that he does not want to discourage people taking up beekeeping as a hobby , but it should not be seen as a way of helping bees in busy , built - up areas .			0

they say city *dwellers* looking to help honey bees should plant their *favourite* flowers
