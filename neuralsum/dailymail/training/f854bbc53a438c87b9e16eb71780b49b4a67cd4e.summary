as one of the most powerful brands in the world and a byword for cool , @entity0 has become known for its minimalist billboards and ads. but it was n’t always the case : in the 70s and 80s @entity0 was a plucky upstart to @entity12 ’s dominance , and had to use the power of advertising to get noticed			1
from the pre-iconic logo @entity0 - 1 computer built by @entity19 in his parents ’ basement in 1976 to the first colourful @entity22 in 1998 , their adverts have evolved in line with the machinery			1
the thinking has changed by the time the @entity0 comes along a year later - for which the company chose a simple shot of a housewife tending the kitchen , looking dotingly on her husband who sits working on the computer at the kitchen table			1
the @entity0 ad is a more minimalist attempt , just showing the machine being used with its name this is followed by the first advert including the now iconic logo against a backdrop of a red apple and a computer			1
it reads : ' a is for @entity0 : it ’s the first thing you know about personal computers			2
' later adverts for the @entity0 show signs of @entity0 ’s simple ethos and design philosophy			1
one featuring an apple against a white backdrop reads : ' simplicity is the ultimate sophistication			0
introducing the @entity0 personal computer			2
' later ads for the @entity0 show the firm 's iconic logo being used for the first time the multicoloured logo first used by @entity0 was the star of this ad the @entity0 was designed to look like a home computer rather than a piece of electronic hardware , and this was reflected in some of its adverts			1
another inventive and cheeky campaign featured a naked man standing infront of a forest - mirroring @entity88 in the @entity89 - whose blushes are spared by the judicious positioning of a computer			0
the tag line reads : ' we ’re looking for the most original use of an @entity0 since @entity88 '			2
the competition invited people to send in their stories of how they used their @entity0 computer			0
the firm ran a contest to find out what its users were doing with their @entity0 via this advert in 1980 @entity0 also produced its own guide to choosing a computer to help consumers , many of whom where still confused about what the machines could do , make up their mind it was @entity0 ’s adverts in the 1980s that first forged its link with the student market			1
on directly targeting students featured an image of youngsters using their computers in a classroom , pronouncing it the ' educational computer '			0
others highlighted its appeal to creative types , in contrast to the more business - like approach of its competitors			0
it used a series of adverts featuring @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , sending the message that buying an @entity0 would equip the user with similar powers of intellect			2
one , showing @entity135 superimposed next to an @entity0 , reads : ' @entity135 had one of the best minds of 1776 , but today you can make better decisions with an @entity0			0
' the firm created a series of adverts featuring @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 , sending the message that buying an @entity0 would equip the user with similar powers of intellect even in its early days , @entity0 ads focused on simplicity , showing just the product and a catchline a later advert emphasises the individuality of @entity0 users			1
against a picture of a hand pulling a computer screen from a bag it says : ' of the 235 million people in @entity163 , only a fraction can use a computer			0
' in the 1990s , @entity0 began to branch out and advertise some of its other products including its laptops , software packages and its @entity169 handheld			2
an unusual , text heavy ad from @entity0 explaining exactly what its machines can do in the 1990s @entity0 began advertising a wider range of products , including the ill - fated @entity169 handheld machine which was a precursor to today 's @entity178 @entity0 also began advertising its portable machines , which were based on the @entity22 's translucent design after the original @entity0 and the @entity181 came the brightly coloured @entity22 , with its stripped down advertising			1
one advert next to the computer says : ' chic			0
' another at a similar time , pulled in a celebrity endorsement of @entity190 and its now well - known slogan ' think different '			0
a later minimalist advert of a laptop against a white background carried the tag : ' black tie optional '			0
an early all in one machine from @entity0 showed off how @entity199 designers used the machine @entity0 's ' sunflower ' @entity22 design , which targeted pc owners with its comments on their bland design at the time			1

adverts show @entity0 's products from the @entity0 - 1 in 1976 to the 1998 release of the @entity22
