by @entity1 reporter published : 17:16 est , 28 january 2013 updated : 03:20 est , 29 january 2013 with its sinister dim lighting , map floor and huddled centre seating , it looks more like a @entity7 secret lair than a @entity9 meeting			2
but the room - complete with a domed roof and suspended overhead screens - is in fact a conference facility at @entity15 , and the attendees , a group of ministers			2
and pictured deep in conversation , prime minister @entity19 was not discussing a covert wicked plot , but instead the country 's @entity23 high - speed rail link			1
007 : prime minister @entity19 at a @entity9 meeting in @entity26 which looked similar to scenes in the @entity7 movies a meeting between @entity31 members , a fictional global terrorist organisation , in the @entity7 film @entity34 the map of @entity26 on the floor was remarkably similar to that used by evil villain @entity38 to show his mobsters his plan to obliterate the world economy			2
and while @entity19 was not wielding a stick , and did not have to fight off @entity7 , he did face an attack from those opposed to his plans			0
he faced a backlash from conservative mps opposed to the high - speed rail link as the government published draft plans to extend the line to the north of @entity54			1
the prime minister said extending the already - planned @entity56 to @entity23 line as far as @entity58 and @entity26 would ' spread wealth and prosperity ' around the country			2
but campaigners denounced the scheme as ' fundamentally flawed ' and transport secretary @entity64 faced anger from senior backbenchers as he outlined the preferred route in the @entity68			0
@entity69 said it was a ' major error ' to put off a decision on a proposed spur to @entity73 pending the results of sir @entity76 ' review of future airport capacity , which is not due to give its final report until the summer of 2015			0
a map used by @entity38 to tell his mobsters his secret plan in the @entity7 film @entity38 serious : prime minister @entity19 listens during a regional cabinet meeting in @entity84 yesterday the second phase of @entity23 envisages five stops on a 211 - mile y - shaped extension northwards from @entity88 - scheduled to be completed in 2032 , six years after the first phase			1
there will also be a ' dedicated link ' alongside the high - speed line at @entity93 to link up with standard trains - reducing journey times to @entity96 and @entity97			1
officials say the Â£ 32.7billion project will create at least 100,000 jobs and would cut the journey time from @entity58 to @entity88 to 41 minutes , and from @entity58 to @entity56 to one hour eight minutes - almost half the present times			0
talks : @entity19 told a @entity9 meeting that the high - speed rail would ' radically reduce journey times ' and was ' a vital part of economic regeneration and the future of our country ' @entity26 will be 57 minutes away from @entity88 compared to one hour 58 minutes today , and one hour 22 minutes away from @entity111 , down from two hours 12 minutes , according to @entity113 projections			1
the move was widely welcomed by businesses , which called on the government to follow it up with funding for further infrastructure links within the regions			0
but critics suggested that siting the @entity122 stop outside the city centre and locating the east @entity125 station between @entity126 and @entity127 meant that much of the benefit of shorter travel times would be lost as passengers switch to slower local services for the final leg of their journey			0
mr @entity19 told the @entity9 meeting in @entity26 that high - speed rail would ' radically reduce journey times ' and was ' a vital part of economic regeneration and the future of our country '			1
he indicated he was determined to withstand pressure for a u-turn , telling @entity142 : ' this is going to happen			0
i have been a strong supporter right from the start			0
' @entity19 arrives by train for the meeting as the government pressed ahead with a planned high - speed rail link			1

cabinet meeting was held yesterday in @entity26 to discuss high - speed rail link
