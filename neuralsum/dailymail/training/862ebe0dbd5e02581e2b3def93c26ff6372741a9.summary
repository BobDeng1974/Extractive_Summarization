@entity1 are now tied with @entity2 among women voters , a new poll shows , introducing a surprising twist into the midterm elections			1
women have long been an essential component of the @entity2 's base , and the party 's declaration that the @entity1 is at war with women has gone a long way to set back the opposing political party with female voters			1
an @entity18 - @entity17 poll released on tuesday has 44 percent of women choosing the @entity1 to lead @entity19 while 42 percent stuck by the @entity2			1
@entity21 elections worker @entity20 points voters to the polls on the first day of early , in - person voting in @entity25 on monday			0
@entity25 is one of a handful of states that has already opened it 's polls for midterm election voting women now say they 'd like to see @entity1 win control of @entity19 in the midterm elections			1
this represents a significant shift in voting patterns of women , who traditionally favor the @entity2			1
just last month @entity2 led republicans among women by seven points that 's a significant shift from just a month ago when @entity2 led @entity1 47 - 40 among women voters			1
@entity41 press secretary @entity40 told @entity42 in an email that the @entity1 's efforts to appeal to female voters with policies that cut across gender are proving successful			2
' women are sick and tired of being talked down to and treated like single issue voters by the @entity50 , ' @entity40 said			0
' unlike what @entity52 and the @entity2 might think , we care about more than reproductive rights , we want a strong economy , strong national defense and for everyone to have a shot at their @entity60 dream			0
enough is enough and this poll reflects that			0
' @entity1 have struggled to gain ground with women ever since former @entity68 rep. @entity67 suggested in 2012 that rape rarely leads to pregnancy			2
' if it 's a legitimate rape , the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down , ' @entity67 , the @entity1 's nominee for the @entity71 in @entity68 , claimed			0
the ' legitimate rape ' incident , as it 's now called , became a plague upon the @entity1 that year			0
a question about @entity67 's remarks took down the @entity1 's nominee to the @entity71 in @entity82 , state treasurer @entity83 , as well			0
@entity2 also used the @entity1 's opposition to the president 's health care law against candidates , claiming it was evidence that @entity1 do n't care about women 's health			1
the health care law mandates that insurance companies cover contraception and preventative health services for women			0
it also bars insurance providers from declining @entity60 for coverage based on pre-existing conditions like pregnancy			0
@entity1 want to repeal the entire health care law and start from scratch			0
while they 're not necessarily against requiring insurance companies to cover health screenings for women they believe that contraception coverage is a violation of businesses ' religious liberties			0
the @entity1 's position on the issue was construed in 2012 to mean that they were against access to contraception for women , and @entity1 presidential nominee @entity113 lost women to @entity114 by 11 points as a result			2
since then , @entity2 have made @entity1 ' refusal to pass legislation mandating that businesses pay their female employees the same amount as their male counterparts the centerpiece of their argument against the @entity1 when courting women voters			1
@entity114 trounced @entity113 in the 2012 presidential election , thanks in part , to women voters in response to the @entity18 poll , the @entity130 told @entity42 on wednesday that ' in governors races and senate races across the country we are seeing leads for democrats with women voters and that 's because our candidates have had their back			1
' ' from equal pay to access to health care , there 's no question @entity2 have supported the interests of women and families while @entity1 have worked to obstruct progress , ' @entity130 deputy communications director @entity143 said			2
the @entity130 pointed to the @entity71 race as an example of how individual @entity2 candidates are outpacing their @entity1 challengers with women			2
there , @entity2 rep. @entity156 is winning women by 14 points despite the fact that the @entity1 contender , state senator @entity160 , is a woman , a poll issued by @entity162 earlier this month shows			1
the survey notably shows @entity156 losing male voters by 16 points , however , and losing the race to @entity168 by a single digit			0
a @entity171 poll taken a week later showed the same trend , with @entity168 up by two overall and 18 points among men			0
@entity156 led among women in the poll 52 - 39			2
the @entity18 discovered in its generic ballot test , which looks at parties , not candidates , this month that @entity60 nationwide prefer @entity2 to lead @entity19 over @entity1 by two points			1
when the pool of respondents is winnowed down to just those who are considered likely to vote in the nov. 4 elections , the pendulum shifts the other way , however			0
in that version of the poll , @entity1 had a double - digit to lead over @entity2 to win control of @entity19			1
likely voters told @entity18 's pollsters that they favor @entity1 , 47 percent , to @entity2 , 39 percent , to run the legislative branch .			1

a poll released *yesterday* has 44 percent of women choosing the @entity1 to lead @entity19 ; 42 percent stuck by the @entity2
that 's a significant shift from just a month ago when @entity2 led @entity1 47 - 40 among women voters
the @entity1 has struggled in the past to connect with women voters
