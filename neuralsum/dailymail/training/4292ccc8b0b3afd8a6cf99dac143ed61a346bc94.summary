@entity10 , aged 27 at the time , had been accused of wounding the horses under the cover of darkness then writing threatening anonymous letters to police , charges he always contested			1
his conviction caused public outrage with more than 10,000 people , including criminal lawyers , protesting it			0
among the most high profile supporters of the protest was @entity2 , who at the time was among the most celebrated writers in the country			0
@entity2 became convinced that @entity10 was innocent after meeting in him in a hotel lobby in 1906 on his release from prison			1
noticing how bad @entity10 's eyesight was , he concluded it would have been impossible for someone with such poor vision to carry out the crimes at night			1
wrongfully convicted : a mugshot of @entity10 , who was wrongly convicted in october 1903 of wounding a pony , the eighth of a series of horse mutilations in the farming and mining county of @entity29 in a style akin to his most famous character , @entity3 , @entity2 set about logically compiling reams of evidence in a bid to disprove @entity69 's guilt and see him pardoned			1
the writer became more and more obsessed with the case , bombarding @entity29 police chief captain @entity72 with daily letters putting forward evidence he had gathered from crime scenes and from forensics experts			1
@entity2 , a doctor before taking up writing , also offered his advice to experts in the case			0
in one letter to the veterinary surgeon who had examined the mutilated horses @entity2 suggested he ' examine the wounds upon the horses from the point of view that they are caused by a very large horse - lancet ... the invariable long wound suggests an instrument which can not stab , having a blount [ sic ] end '			2
the legendary author , who invented @entity3 1887 , offered his own list of suspects , eventually pointing the finger at villager @entity97 , and suggested witnesses who should be interviewed by police to back up his findings			1
@entity2 's letters : the author bombarded @entity29 police chief captain @entity72 with daily letters putting forward evidence he had gathered from crime scenes and from forensics experts in a letter to capt @entity72 suggesting he investigate @entity109 , @entity2 wrote : ' i am convinced he was concerned in some of the earlier outrages ... [ he is ] fiendishly cunning			1
' he added : ' colour prejudice may have been enough to prompt them [ the @entity109 brothers ] to bait the @entity10 family in the cruel way they did ... the man 's own relatives admit that he has times of dangerous mania			1
' the writer 's efforts in clearing @entity10 's name were depicted in a 2005 novel by @entity21 author @entity13			1
the book was turned into a television series , with @entity16 playing @entity2 and @entity127 playing @entity69 - set to be aired on monday			1
in may 1907 as direct result of @entity2 's work an inquiry into the case was opened and concluded with @entity10 being officially pardoned			1
tv drama : @entity16 is set to play @entity2 in an @entity18 drama based on the author 's quest to clear @entity10 's name capt @entity72 however remained convinced of @entity10 's guilt and refused to investigate any other leads , including looking into @entity97			1
in sheer frustration , @entity2 wrote : ' i never thought my case ... was good enough for a prosecution ... [ but ] ... to say that there is ' absolutely nothing ' against a man who exhibited a weapon and said it was the sort of one which did the outrages is a statement which makes me feel rather hopeless about the use of getting evidence			0
i wonder what would be something if that is nothing '			0
although he helped secure a pardon for @entity69 , @entity2 failed in his bid to get financial compensation paid , which he said was ' to the deep disgrace of @entity163 administration '			0
the correspondence between @entity2 and capt @entity72 continued until 1911 , becoming more and more hostile as the years went by			0
in the final exchange , @entity2 wrote ' your letter is a series of inaccuracies mixed up with a good deal of rudeness '			0
notes written by @entity72 at the same time asked ' is @entity2 mad ? ' and stated ' this matter is a personal one between sir @entity2 and myself '			0
in a police memo on the case @entity72 wrote : ' it was on ' evidence ' and ' proof ' such as he obtained in the above instance that the great @entity3 based his accusations ... '			2
in a curious appendix to his printed report published in 1920 marked confidential , @entity72 admits to fabricating evidence for @entity2 to chase , designed to discredit him and his methods			0
it reveals he created an elaborate ruse involving @entity109 appearing to travel to @entity189 to deliver a poison - pen letter to @entity2			0
experts think the archive of 30 handwritten letters , none of which has ever been published , once belonged to @entity72 and was passed on following his death in 1947			2
also included in the archive are notes kept by @entity72 during the case , police reports from the investigation , witness statements , press cuttings and even a police mugshot of @entity69			2
the collection will be sold on behalf of a private collector by @entity189 auctioneers @entity207			0

' he saw himself as the champion of justice and after meeting @entity10 he set about trying to prove his innocence with the same logical and forensic approach @entity3 was known for			2
' @entity2 was so incredibly committed to the case and that comes across in his letters , which he wrote daily and in great detail			2
' the majority of the letters are to captain @entity72 , the @entity29 police chief , in a bid to get him to change his mind about the guilt of @entity69			1
' @entity2 actually went to the crime scenes and gathered evidence himself , which @entity72 took exception to because he saw it as undermining the police 's own work			2
' the letters offer a view of the fractious relationship between @entity2 and @entity72 which has not been seen to this extent before			2
' both men were convinced they were right and neither would back down			0
by the end of the correspondence it is clear they had both lost patience with one another			0
' to have such a large collection of handwritten , autographed letters in one collection is very rare			0
it is likely the archive was compiled by @entity72 and passed on			0
' it is now being sold by a private collector who inherited it from a friend who had connections to the @entity29 area			2
' as soon as this collection came in i knew it was something very special			0
' we are expecting a lot of interest from collectors of @entity2 memorabilia and fans of @entity3 - both have a huge international appeal			0
