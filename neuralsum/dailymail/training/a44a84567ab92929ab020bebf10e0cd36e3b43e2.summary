by @entity0 a 100 kilometre - wide crater has been found in @entity2 , the result of a massive asteroid impact a billion years before any other known collision on @entity6			1
the previously oldest known crater on @entity6 formed two billion years ago and the chances of finding an even older impact were thought to be astronomically low			1
now , a team of scientists from the @entity12 ( @entity12 ) in @entity13 , @entity14 in @entity15 , @entity16 in @entity17 and the @entity18 in @entity19 has upset these odds			2
explosive : this simulated image shows how the impact would have looked - it would have wiped out all forms of higher life if it happened later in @entity6 's history hidden in the runes : evidence came in the form of broken - up , contorted , melted and hydrothermally altered rocks affected by the impact and influx of sea - water during the impact the spectacular craters on the @entity36 formed from impacts with asteroids and comets betweenthree3 and four billion years ago			1
the early @entity6 , with its far greater gravitational mass , must have experienced even more collisions at this time - but the evidence has been eroded away or covered by younger rocks			1
following a detailed programme of fieldwork , funded by @entity12 and the @entity48 ‘ @entity47 ’ ( @entity49 ) , the team have discovered the remains of a giant three billion - year - old impact near the @entity53 region of @entity2			1
' this single discovery means that we can study the effects of cratering on the @entity6 nearly a billion years further back in time than was possible before , ” according to dr @entity57 of @entity14 ’s @entity58 , who was part of the team			2
it is possible or even likely that the meteorite hit the sea , for the preserved rocks have been intensely altered by circulating hot aqueus fluids			2
these fluids were likely derived from sea water that would have been able to penetrate deep into the @entity6 's crust through the numerous fissures and crush zones generated by the impact			0
@entity71 at the @entity18 , @entity72 , @entity19 , has carried out a series of provisional model calculations , which suggest that the impacting meteorite at @entity53 may have had a diameter of more than 30 km , i.e. , about twice the size of the @entity80 meteorite and with a mass about ten times larger			1
if this meteorite had hit the @entity36 , the final crater structure would have had a diameter well above 1000km and easily visible from @entity6			2
however , due to the much stronger gravity of our planet , the @entity53 structure may have had a diameter of ' only ' some 500 - 600km clues : @entity92 mountain , which is around 1050m high , is believed to be the crushed core of the structure the dull grey rocks were crushed to fine powder by the impact , and then cut by white melt sheets making an impact : the asteroid is believed to have hit close to where the town of @entity53 in @entity2 if an impact of this size hit the @entity6 today , it would not only be able to pulverise a medium - sized national state but its global effects would also kill all higher life			1
then , three billion years ago , there was not much life to extinguish , but as yet no depositional rocks of matching age have yet been identified that could enlighten the effects of the @entity53 impact such as extreme tsunamis , deposition of re-condensated atmospheric glass particles from the evaporated meteorite or other signs of global atmospheric and marine effects			0
finding the evidence was made all the harder because there is no obvious bowl - shaped crater left to find			1
over the three billion years since the impact , the land has been eroded down to expose deeper crust 25km below the original surface			0
all external parts of the impact structure have been removed , but the effects of the intense impact shock wave penetrated deep into the crust - far deeper than at any other known crater - and these remain visible			1
however , because the effects of impact at these depths have never been observed before it has taken nearly three years of painstaking work to assemble all the key evidence			0
if you look at the @entity36 on a clear night through a pair of ordinary , hand - held binoculars , you 'll see a multitude of meteorite craters			2
some are larger than 1000 km in diameter and readily visible with the naked eye			0
through the first 500 million years of @entity149 history , both the @entity36 and the @entity6 were constantly bombarded with a multitude of small and large meteorites and comets			0
some scientists even think that life was brought to the @entity6 by comets			0
the @entity36 has preserved the remains of thousands of impacts , but on @entity6 only about 180 such impact structures are known , and most of them are very small , young and repidly decaying			0
contrary to the @entity36 , the @entity6 is a dynamic planet with plate tectonics , mountain belts and erosion , which means that most impact structures are eroded away , destroyed by mountain building processes or buried by younger deposits over geological time			0
until recently , the 2.02 billion years old and 300 km wide @entity80 crater in @entity170 was considered to be both the oldest and largest impact structure on @entity6			1
it is estimated that the impacting meteorite had a diameter of about 15 km. during the development of the final crater structure , a kilometre - thick layer of sedimentary rocks containing the @entity6 's largest gold deposits collapsed into the cavity excavated by the meteorite and in this way became protected from erosion and preserved until today			1
also the second largest impact structure on @entity6 , the 1.85 billion years old @entity185 crater in @entity186 , hosts world - class mineral deposits - in this case nickel - rich minerals that were melted and concentrated by the extreme heating caused by the impact			1
' the process was rather like a @entity196 story , ' said dr @entity57			0
' we eliminated the impossible in terms of any conventional terrestrial processes , and were left with a giant impact as the only explanation for all of the facts			0
' only around 180 impact craters have ever been discovered on @entity6 and around 30 per cent of them contain important natural resources of minerals or oil and gas			2
the largest and oldest known crater prior to this study , the 300 kilometre wide @entity80 crater in @entity170 , is 2 billion years in age and heavily eroded			1
dr @entity57 added that ' it has taken us nearly three years to convince our peers in the scientific community of this but the mining industry was far more receptive			0
a @entity186 exploration company has been using the impact model to explore for deposits of nickel and platinum metals at @entity53 since the autumn of 2011			0
' the international team was led by @entity228 , senior research scientist at @entity12			2
the first scientific paper documenting the discovery has just been published in the journal ‘ @entity6 and @entity232 ’ .			0

100km ( *62mile* ) wide crater discovered in @entity2 - and it is possible crater is more than 500km in size
