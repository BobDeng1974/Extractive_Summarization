as a contender for prime minister , @entity3 ’s comparison to the dopey @entity5 model @entity6 is one he has always endeavoured to distance himself from			1
but doing so may prove easier said than done , because @entity7 – creators of @entity6 and @entity6 – have been rather mischievous in their latest film and included a character which bears an uncanny resemblance to the @entity13 leader			1
the advert trailer for @entity7 ’s latest @entity5 stop - animation children ’s film @entity17 reveals a displeased waiter character with more than a passing likeness to mr @entity3			1
last year in a speech to launch @entity13 ’s summer campaigning mr @entity3 even admitted the resemblance and said : ‘ i am not from central casting			1
' you can find people who are more square - jawed , more chiselled , look less like @entity6 ’			2
and in 2012 he told described himself as ‘ somebody who looks a bit like @entity6 from @entity6 ’ , before adding : ‘ if spin doctors could design a politician , i suspect he would n’t look like me			2
’ it is an open secret in @entity47 that mr @entity3 is worried about his poor public image – enough so to have hired help from a world renowned autism expert and a voice coach likening mr @entity3 to @entity6 is an easy dig for the @entity54 , and during the @entity56 last year @entity55 took at swipe at mr @entity3 while explaining details of a tax credit for children ’s television and animation production			2
lookalike : the @entity64 ( left ) has been likened to @entity6 ( right ) from @entity7 's series of @entity6 films , but now appears to have a character all of his own he said : ‘ the man behind @entity6 ’s voice has retired			1
but after next may i am sure the whole @entity71 will unite behind a suitable and , by then , available candidate ’			0
on the @entity75 @entity74 last year the @entity13 leader was excruciatingly handed pictures of himself as an @entity7 caricature , and he sought to laugh it off , telling the presenter : ‘ i did n’t realise you were going to bring me present , that ’s incredibly kind			1
i will show it to my kids			0
’ he went on to say that photo opportunities and charisma were n’t as important as raw policy , but mr @entity90 told him : ‘ you may hate it , you may think it is trivial , you may think it is awful , but it ’s how things are done now			0
‘ just as how in the @entity94 period you had to stand up and make a three - hour speech in front of 300 people , now you have to do photo opportunities and deal with the internet and memes and so forth			0
‘ therefore it is the job , it is the duty of a political leader to be better at it that you have been			0
it is not enough to say “ it does n’t matter ”			0
it ’s the way things are done			0

@entity3 *previously* likened to @entity6 from @entity7 films
but the @entity13 leader now appears to have a character all of his own
viewers said waiter from new @entity17 trailer looks like politician
