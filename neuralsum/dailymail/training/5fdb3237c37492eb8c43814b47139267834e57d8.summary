by @entity1 reporter published : 15:36 est , 1 october 2013 updated : 22:16 est , 1 october 2013 as the @entity3 government ground to a halt at midnight , social media and the world 's press promptly derided politicians for their inability to come to an agreement			1
the foreign press treated news of the shutdown with bemusement but little surprise - although some commenters expressed concern that gridlock could stunt other economic recoveries			1
and on social media , users poked fun at the government while federal employees who are forced to take time off both celebrated and complained about not being able to work			1
the impassioned responses came after the government closed for the first time in 17 years as it failed to come to an agreement over its spending bill			0
it meant that non-essential services were shut , forcing some 800,000 workers to take unpaid leave			0
closed for business : an office for the @entity3 @entity37 in @entity38 , @entity35 displays a sign on tuesday saying it is closed ' due to the lapse in federal government funding ' the shutdown , which came as @entity43 and @entity44 clashed over @entity45 , could cost the economy a staggering $ 1 billion a week - which the rest of the world promptly pointed out			1
' it is a risk to the world economy if the @entity3 ca n't properly sort out its spending plans , ' @entity51 prime minister @entity50 told @entity55 on tuesday			1
in @entity57 , @entity56 claimed ' a superpower has paralyzed itself ' while @entity59 said the could be ' fatal consequences ' that could damage the @entity3 recovery			2
but it also noted that the world 's markets did not panic and there has been little impact , which suggests it had been expected for weeks and priced in accordingly			2
derision : an editorial in @entity68 on tuesday was headlined , ' @entity69 , wake up , they 've all gone crazy ! ' as it warned the shutdown could spell bad news for the @entity43 mocked : the world 's media laughed at the world superpower 's inability to reach an agreement no access : a barrier blocks the @entity80 in d.c. tuesday as national parks were closed in @entity82 , @entity68 noted that the last government shutdown cost $ 1.4 billion ( or $ 2 billion today ) , and turned the public against the @entity43 , whom voters blamed for the chaos			1
' @entity69 , wake up , they ’ve gone crazy ! ' @entity68 said in an editorial , calling the shutdown ' grotesque '			0
the @entity82 were clear to point out that the repercussions were being felt across the @entity91 as the @entity3 cemeteries in @entity82 from @entity93 were closed as a result of the shutdown			1
in the @entity51 , @entity95 noted called it ' bizarre ' and that the final hours ' could well have been scripted by @entity97 ' as the sides worried more about who was going to get the blame for the shutdown rather than actually stopping it			0
the @entity101 also derided the @entity3 system , writing that the inability to reach a decision did n't ' say much for the budgetary processes in the world 's largest economy '			1
it comes as little surprise that the @entity111 press saw the shutdown as an opportunity for ridicule though some of the sting got lost in translation			2
the @entity117 splashed a headline reading ' the " elephants " are robbing the @entity3 government ' , making a play on the @entity43 mascot			1
the largest newspaper in @entity124 made a point to calm local concerns , reiterating that the shutdown would not lead to any military reductions for @entity3 troops abroad , as the @entity3 plays a pivotal role in their regional security when it comes to @entity133			1
in the @entity3 , commentators and the public expressed their dismay on social networks - and even @entity138 had something to say			2
' they actually did it , ' his @entity141 feed read			0
' a group of @entity43 in the @entity144 just forced a government shutdown over @entity45 instead of passing a real budget			2
' fighting back : protestors demonstrated by the @entity148 demanding the @entity144 pass a @entity149 without any amendments that attempted to defund the @entity45 keeping history locked up : one of the clearest examples of the effect of the shutdown comes from the closure of all @entity156 @entity158 @entity157 quipped : ' due to government shutdown , we will not be posting or responding from this account			0
' a mock @entity3 government @entity141 account added : ' the government is currently on shutdown			1
be prepared for no noticeable difference			0
the government wasnt working anyways			0
' and @entity171 creator @entity170 wrote : ' per several @entity171 episodes : whenever there ’s a government shutdown , we can all steal a zoo animal			0
' other users who are being forced to stay at home as they are deemed non-essential workers also had something to say - with some enjoying their days off in the sun. ' spending my # furlough day drinking sangria and eating nutella crepes , ' one wrote			0
@entity185 , a @entity158 astrophysicist , added : ' mid-day # furlough run ! nice day out there			0
except for , ya know , the inability to do my job			0
