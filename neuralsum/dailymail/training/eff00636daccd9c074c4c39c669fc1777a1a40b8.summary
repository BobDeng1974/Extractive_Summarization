tormented : @entity0 was bullied mercilessly at school and even had to move because of it he 's the @entity4 tribute act turned mr @entity6 singing sensation but life has n't always been smooth sailing for @entity10			1
the 25 - year - old has revealed that he was bullied while at school and that his experience is the reason for his insistence that proceeds from his new @entity17 single go to an anti-bullying charity			1
now the campaigner is calling for the government to take action against sites like @entity23 and says he was horrified by the suicide of @entity26 schoolgirl @entity25 , 14 , who committed suicide after being abused online			1
' it does just show how powerful these sites can be , ' said @entity10 in an exclusive interview with @entity30			1
' when such things have happened and continue to happen , i certainly do think they should be investigated and discussed - at the very least heavily supervised			0
' kids are very vulnerable , some more than others , and these kind of sites can provide an opportunity for bullies to hurt people anonymously so i personally feel they do more harm than good and absolutely need to be investigated			2
' my experience was the same as most other kids in the same situation really , ' he explains			0
' i was made to feel very unwelcome by certain people through that time and like many other kids found it difficult and very uncomfortable to the point where i did n't want to be there or be part of the school			2
' in the end i moved school because of it , ' he says , adding : ' it 's the best move i ever made			2
' and what would he do if a young friend came to him and revealed that they were being bullied ? according to @entity10 , letting them know that help is at hand is crucial			1
' i would sit down with them offer to help and tell them there is help out there and that you can overcome it , ' he explains			0
living the dream : despite the bullies doing their worst , @entity0 went on to become this year 's mr @entity6 festive : mr @entity6 , a.k.a @entity10 , is to release a charity @entity17 single called here we are ' i would suggest they talk to someone , if not a parent , a teacher or a connections officer , and someone will help you			1
' he adds : ' @entity93 does n't have to wreck your life and it can be beaten and overcome but the most important thing is to talk to someone			0
' now , he hopes that his @entity17 single , entitled here we are ( @entity17 ) , will help children being bullied overcome their tormentors and start enjoying life again			1
' i think the government could perhaps do more , ' he adds			0
' i think there is help for kids but bullying is something that can affect a person for their whole lives so of course there 's no such thing as enough investment			0
' i 'm really hoping people get behind [ the song ] so we can all try make a big difference and help as many kids in similar situations as possible and , who knows , hopefully prevent tragedies like @entity25 from happening again			0
' here we are ( merry @entity17 ) is out now and all proceeds will go to @entity125			2
