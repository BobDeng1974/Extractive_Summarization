@entity0 has been appointed to referee @entity2 's game vs @entity3 on sunday @entity0 's experience will help him cope with any pressures , just like i did when @entity6 beat @entity8 2 - 1 to win the first part of their historic treble 51 - year - old @entity11 will referee @entity13 's clash against @entity14 in what may be his final game in the @entity17 by @entity18 follow @ @ @entity19 @entity0 has been entrusted with the game which is expected to see @entity2 confirmed as @entity17 champions on sunday			1
the 43 - year - old is often seen as the @entity24 â€™s safe pair of hands as he has the experience to cope with any pressures that might come to bear should the game not go as expected			2
i remember refereeing the last game of the 1998/99 season at @entity32 where @entity6 knew if they beat @entity8 they would be crowned champions and secure the first trophy of their historic treble			1
man in the middle : @entity0 will referee @entity2 's home clash against @entity3 on sunday @entity8 went a goal up and news came through that title rivals @entity43 were winning at @entity44			1
it takes strength of mind and character to block out those outside influences and focus on the job in hand			0
@entity0 will have to do that at the @entity53 and not dwell on any negative thoughts regarding " costing " @entity2 the title			0
he refereed their recent 2 - 2 draw with @entity58 and 6 - 3 home win over @entity43 - either result would suit them this time			0
been there , done that : @entity18 refereed @entity6 's 2 - 1 final day win against @entity8 in 1999 end of an era ? @entity11 ( right ) could referee his final game when @entity13 host @entity14 on sunday @entity13 also have the vastly experienced @entity11 on their final game which could be his last top flight appointment			1
there is no retirement age any more but as @entity11 turns 52 next season he must realise that his active refereeing must come to an end at some point			0
@entity11 had refereed only one @entity17 game at @entity76 this season , a 4 - 0 win against @entity8 .			2
