the failure of teachers to control badly behaved children in lessons is dragging down standards , the chief inspector of schools will warn this week			1
too many teachers have come to believe that poor discipline is an inevitable part of life in the classroom and heads need to crack down on the problem , sir @entity7 will say			1
he will deliver his verdict after the publication of a major report by the schools inspectorate @entity19 , showing that a vast amount of teaching time is wasted because staff are struggling to control problem pupils			1
the @entity35 report , based on specially commissioned surveys of teachers and parents and more than 3,000 school inspections , found that most teachers admit they are plagued by pupils making silly comments to get attention , swinging on chairs , passing notes around , humming or using mobile phones			0
many teachers complained that heads were failing to back them and did not assert their authority when dealing with pupils flouting rules			0
the findings will bolster sir @entity7 ’s concerns that ‘ a culture of casual acceptance ’ of persistent disruption was preventing @entity55 ’s school system from competing with high - performing @entity57 countries			1
this week he will also say that while serious breaches of discipline are less common today , the chances of pupils being in calm and well - ordered classrooms had become ‘ something of a lottery ’ , damaging their future prospects			0
@entity19 ’s annual report in december found that 700,000 pupils were attending schools where behaviour needed to improve			1
@entity73 , general secretary of @entity74 said teachers are not failing to address disruptive pupils and in a challenge to heads , he will argue that strong leadership is the key to cracking down on disruptive behaviour and creating good conditions for learning			2
@entity73 , general secretary of union @entity74 , said her members acknowledged there was a widespread problem with low - level disruption in lessons			0
but she added : ‘ the chief inspector is , as usual , talking nonsense to suggest that teachers accept this and are failing to address it			0
‘ what teachers do say is that … they are frequently unsupported by school leaders who too often do not teach and are divorced from the day to day realities of life in the classroom			2
’ @entity103 , general secretary of the @entity104 , said : ‘ behaviour in the vast majority of schools is good and continually improving , according to @entity19 itself			1
‘ we agree that school leaders must support staff			0
‘ good behaviour comes from the skills of teachers but also from a consistent policy across the institution			2

sir @entity7 of @entity19 said schools had problems with discipline
he *claimed* too many teachers believe bad behaviour is a part of life
sir @entity7 suggested this reduced the amount of time available for teaching
