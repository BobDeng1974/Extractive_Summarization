workers on a cherry - picker were pictured putting fairy lights on the christmas tree outside @entity4 this afternoon in homes across the country this weekend people have been busy putting up their @entity9 decorations , and it seems that @entity4 is no exception			1
workers were pictured this afternoon using a cherry - picker to hang fairy lights and other decorations on the tree outside @entity16 , with a big switch - on scheduled for tomorrow			1
the tree itself , a 20ft @entity21 fir which took ten years to grow , was hand - picked by farmer @entity22 after he won a competition back in october			1
mr @entity22 , who owns @entity24 at @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity27 , won grower of the year at the @entity30 awards			0
runner up @entity31 , from @entity32 , will have the honour of providing a smaller 11 and a half foot tree for the pillared room inside @entity4 , while @entity36 , also from @entity27 , will provide the wreath for the door			2
the lights outside @entity16 will be turned on for the first time this season in a ceremony tomorrow afternoon which all the growers will attend			1
last year 's tree was provided by @entity46 and decorated with hundreds of @entity48 fairy lights , along with silver and white baubles , topped off with a large silver star			2
it is not yet known whether the same decorations will be used this year , though they have been used every year since the coalition came to power in 2010			0
@entity56 - such as the one outside @entity16 - are the @entity58 â€™s most popular @entity9 trees and originate from the mountains on either side of the @entity61 , primarily in @entity62 and @entity63			0
the tree itself is a 20ft @entity21 fir , the most popular kind of tree in the @entity58 , which took ten years to grow the christmas tree pictured outside @entity4 last year			1
it is not known whether the same silver - themed decorations will be used , but they have been used each year since the @entity72 took office then and now : the decorations on the @entity4 tree changed after the @entity76 were ejected , from the gold and bronze theme ( left ) to the blue and silver used today ( right ) they are favoured for the dark green , glossy needles and neat , conical shape which makes them easy to decorate			2
the needles are also slow to drop off , even after the pine has dried out			0
this is different to the @entity89 spruce that usually adorns @entity90 which is sent over every year from @entity91 as a token of thanks for our assistance during the @entity96			0
it typically stands between 60 and 70ft tall , and and is chosen months , or even years in advance			0
the tree , dubbed ' the queen of the forest , ' is cut down during a special ceremony attended by the lord mayor of @entity104 , the @entity58 ambassador to @entity89 and the mayor of @entity91			0
tree grower @entity22 ( pictured ) hand - picked the tree from his stock after winning grower of the year at the @entity30 awards in october @entity31 , from @entity32 , will provide a second 11 and a half foot tree to go in the pillared room inside @entity4 after winning a runner up prize			1
