the immaculately - preserved picture has remained in the @entity27 collection ever since			0
it has been loaned out to various museums over the last 40 years - most recently the @entity30 of @entity31 - and a spokesman for the @entity27 family explained they are selling it now to fund the maintenance of their estates			0
@entity38 , joint international head and co-chairman of old master paintings at auctioneers @entity17 , said : ' there are fewer than 10 major @entity42 in private hands known today and this work must rank as one of the very finest			2
previous owners : @entity1 ( left , depicted in a self portrait ) did the painting for @entity49 of @entity50 , and it was sold to the 5th @entity21 ( right ) after the patron died acting up : @entity52 as @entity53 in the 2014 film mr @entity1 - which is about the artist 's life and is due for release next month ' this painting , which is nearly 200 years old , looks today as if it has come straight from the easel of the artist ; never relined and never subject to restoration , the picture retains the freshness of the moment it was painted			1
' the hairs from @entity1 's brush , the drips of liquid paint which have run down the edge of the canvas , and every scrape of his palette knife have been preserved in incredible detail			1
' " @entity6 , from @entity7 " comes to sale at the same time as the ground - breaking exhibition of " @entity77 " at the @entity78 , which will further enhance our understanding of the artist 's genius			1
' its emergence on the market represents a rare and exciting opportunity for collectors			0
' @entity88 ( left ) , sold for £ 29.7million in 2010 and @entity89 ( right ) , sold for £ 9million in 2009 , both at @entity17 the painting used to hang alongside its sister painting , ' @entity88 ' , in the @entity93 ' homes - in @entity94 and then in @entity95			1
that picture was sold in 2010 - for a record fee for a @entity1 of almost £ 30million - also at @entity17			1
' @entity6 , from @entity7 ' was commissioned by @entity1 ’s patron @entity49 of @entity50 in 1828 , and took seven years and many visits to @entity6 to complete			1
he kept the painting in his home until his death , whereupon it was sold on to the @entity21			1
the 36ins by 49ins oil painting , still in its original frame , is being sold by @entity17 in @entity94 on december 3			1
@entity1 was born in @entity106 , @entity94 in 1775 , the son of @entity1 , a barber and wig maker , and @entity110 , who came from a family of butchers			2
he was a romantic landscape painter , water - colourist and printmaker , but was most famous for his oil paintings			2
although controversial in his time , he is known as ' the painter of light ' and is now widely regarded as one of the greatest artists in @entity122 history			0
his first known venture into art came when he was just 10 years old , after he had been sent to live with his uncle , @entity125 , in @entity126			0
by the age of 11 , his paintings were already being sold in his father 's shop			0
the @entity131 , painted by @entity1 between 1841 - 2 , shoes his love of painting natural scenes including figures made to look very small by their surroundings he was accepted into the @entity137 at 15 , and his first watercolour - a view of the @entity140 , @entity141 - was shown at the summer exhibition in 1790 , when he was the same age			1
he painted a lot of shipwrecks , fires and natural phenomena , as they were suited to his bold style and his ability to capture the essence and energy of nature			0
he put a humans in his paintings to highlight their vulnerability when put next to nature 's enormity			0
what was perhaps most important in all of his painting though , was light , which to @entity1 represented @entity161 and his power			2
@entity1 's unique technique used watercolour style with oil paints and usually strong , albeit natural colours			1
he painted a lot of traditionally @entity2 landscapes , but also travelled around @entity169 a lot , a drew subjects from there too			0
some of his most famous paintings include @entity174 at @entity175 , crossing the @entity176 , and @entity178 - @entity177			0
the @entity1 prize , which is named after him , is presented to a @entity122 artist under the age of 50 every year			0
it is @entity184 's most prominent art prize and often has extremely controversial winners , such as @entity188 's ' my bed '			2
meanwhile , a major new @entity1 exhibition is opening at @entity184 on wednesday			1
the exhibition will feature his flourishing and experimental later years - when critics were suggesting that the painter was losing his mind			0
@entity77 : @entity194 showcases work from the final 15 years of @entity1 's life , from the age of 60 until a year before his death in 1851			1
a woman admires the works of art in a new exhibition at the @entity184 gallery in @entity94 entitled ' @entity204 ' war : the @entity206 and the @entity207 , 1842 ( left ) and @entity208 , also 1942 ( right ) - two of the paintings being shown at the exhibition @entity6 : @entity212 with the @entity213 , 1839 - another of the paintings on display at @entity184 's exhibition showing @entity1 's later work @entity219 ( @entity220 ) - the morning after the @entity221 , 1842 ( left ) and @entity223 - @entity222 , 1844 ( right ) it brings together 180 works from the @entity122 and abroad , as well objects such as palettes and even the spectacles which once belonged to the @entity94 - born barber 's son			1
many of the paintings show @entity1 developing a new understanding of light and colour , but at the same time the artist was being mocked and derided			2
there are oils , such as ' @entity239 ' , among the last painting he exhibited before he died aged 76			0
and watercolours including ' @entity242 ' , which is on loan from a private collection and sold for almost £ 3million at auction in 2007			0
the exhibition features maritime scenes , themes from classical history , and @entity1 engaging with the new technology of the age , steam power			2
a woman views a painting by @entity1 entitled ' @entity255 ' ( right ) at the exhibition , which will run until next january co-curator @entity257 said : ' @entity1 created the most startling pieces during this period but for whatever reason , a major exhibition on @entity1 's later years has not been done before			1
it 's a missing exhibition			0
' but it 's a timely exhibition			0
with an ageing population , and attitudes to age altered , this exhibition speaks to our questions about later life , creatively who are we , what do we do and how do we cope with ageing ? ' @entity1 was continuously innovating , staying sharp and experimental			2
he 's a wonderfully good role model for somebody who is coping with older age and staying vital			0
' he defies the peak and decline model which people associate with artists			0
in that , he 's not unique			0
but he shows a spectacular engagement with contemporary society in a way that no other artist at the time was doing			0
' at the time @entity1 had some loyal patrons and some relatively sympathetic critics but there was also vicious , venomous copy suggesting that he 'd lost his mind and that he 'd got worse as he got older , talking about his eccentricities			2
' visitors to @entity184 can also see a colour wheel installation made in response to @entity1 's work by @entity296 - born artist @entity295 , who famously created the illusion of a glowing sun at @entity299 .			1

the large - scale oil painting , titled ' @entity6 , from @entity7 ' , was produced by the great in 1835
was sold for the only time in 1878 , when it was bought for £ 6,000 by the 5th @entity21 - a future prime minister
