by @entity0 at first glance , the 200 - year - old books are handsomely bound , with the edges of their pages painted in gilt			2
look more closely , however , and you will see a beautiful and intricate painting hidden on the edges of the pages			0
known as ' fore - edge paintings ' ( the fore - edge is the opposite of the spine ) , their existence at all has lain a secret to many since the practice began centuries ago			1
this fore - edge of the 1837 book winter by @entity21 , shows how the paintings reveal themselves this is the fore - edge painting on @entity21 's summer , and depicts a seasonal scene in the countryside now , however , staff at the @entity28 have taken a series of photographs showing how the pages of historic books may contain more than just the story written within			1
@entity34 , a @entity35 librarian at the @entity28 , revealed the books ' secrets in an online posting entitled ' it 's a secret to everybody			1
' the edges of the books ' pages have been painted in gilt , but what is not immediately obvious is that the margins of each page have also been painted in such a way that when the book is fanned slightly , a picture of a scene emerges			0
ms @entity34 used the @entity28 's special collections and @entity52 ' set of four nature books , published in @entity54 in 1837 and entitled @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , by @entity21 , to show how the paintings were hidden			2
she said : ' each has a landscape painting of the season hidden until you begin to read it and bend the pages to turn them			0
' ms @entity34 told @entity66 how the paintings were done , using a clamp			2
she said : ' in order to paint the edges the book has to be clamped in the fanned position to make a flat surface to paint on			0
when the clamp is released , the image disappears			0
' this scene with golden leaves depicts autumn on the book of the same name - but is hidden when it 's closed @entity21 's @entity55 has an incredibly detailed rural scene of horses ploughing a field the librarian took a picture of the painting hidden within the pages of each of the four books , which were donated to the @entity28 by @entity89 , for the website @entity91			2
the artist who painted the images is unknown			0
@entity94 -- edge painting dates back to the 10th century , but the practice of disappearing fore - edge paintings , when they are hidden when the book is fully closed , is thought to date back to 1649			1
initially the paintings featured symbols or family crests , but in the latter half of the 18th century , specialist fore - edge painters began to paint scenes or detailed landscapes , or even erotic pictures			1
the pictures were painted first , before gilt was applied later to the very edges to mask the picture 's existence			0
this photograph of a gilt - edged book shows how disappearing fore - edge pictures look when the book is closed but when the pages are fanned slightly , a detailed picture of the @entity116 in @entity54 appears			1

' disappearing fore - edge paintings ' can only be seen when pages are fanned
the *skilled* practice dates back centuries and is done by specialist painters
librarian at @entity28 posts pictures online showing the paintings
@entity34 says the beautiful pictures are ' a secret to everybody '
