by @entity0 , @entity1 and @entity2 published : 19:34 est , 23 november 2012 updated : 06:58 est , 24 november 2012 an @entity4 - born career criminal suspected of a ‘ marriage of convenience ’ to a @entity8 citizen has been deported from @entity9 to the @entity8			1
police said @entity11 had been arrested 92 times in @entity9 over the past 25 years for crimes from theft to robbery and had used a number of fake identities			1
but because he had married in the @entity8 before his latest crime spree in @entity9 , he was deported to @entity19 rather than to his native @entity4			1
powerless : border agency staff are unable to stop @entity4 criminal @entity11 from entering the @entity8 officials said he was put on a plane to @entity19 after his latest arrest in @entity25 because he was deemed a ‘ security risk ’ in @entity9			1
@entity9 police sources claimed @entity11 , whose whereabouts were unknown last night , had entered into a sham marriage to obtain a @entity8 passport			1
they admitted that unless @entity11 was a wanted man in @entity8 , he would be free to roam the streets and carry on offending as he has done over the past two and a half decades in @entity9			1
his wife ’s identity and the exact date of his marriage , said to have taken place in @entity37 ‘ a few years ago ’ , were not revealed by the @entity9 authorities			2
he was deported to the @entity8 under a 2007 @entity9 law allowing it to expel @entity41 citizens for security reasons			2
a spokesman for police in @entity25 , where 45 - year - old @entity11 was arrested on october 4 and held in an immigration centre pending deportation , declined to name him officially			2
but @entity11 ’s initials appeared in the local media and informed sources confirmed his full @entity51 police spokesman said : ‘ he was deported to @entity8 because he married a @entity8 citizen in the @entity8 and has @entity8 nationality			2
‘ police records show he has been arrested 92 times since 1987 in different parts of @entity9 for crimes including theft and robbery and has been in prison several times			1
he has also used up to 22 identities			0
if this gentleman has put on his @entity8 passport form that he ’s not got a criminal record outside of the @entity8 then he would appear to be lying because his spells in prison date back a number of years			1
’ a police source added : ‘ we suspect he entered into a sham marriage to obtain a @entity8 passport because after marrying he ’s returned to @entity9 and continued offending and in principle does n’t appear to have had any contact in @entity9 with his wife			1
for us it ’s a marriage of convenience			0
’ last night there was no answer at an address in @entity19 where @entity11 is thought to have lived previously			0
@entity9 police declined to offer a full list of his past offences			2
an official admitted : ‘ unless he is wanted in @entity8 then he will obviously be free to walk the streets a free man until such time as he reoffends			0
‘ but with his history , it ’s a question of when and not if he ’s going to reoffend			0
’ the @entity91 said it could not discuss individual cases			0
before he was granted @entity8 citizenship , background checks were carried out on @entity95			0
these would have included establishing whether he had committed any offences in the @entity8			0
figures last year showed @entity41 migrants were committing over 500 crimes a week in @entity8 , but officials were powerless to deport most of them			0
@entity104 ’s interpretation of @entity41 freedom of movement rules means only offenders who have received a jail term of at least two years can be deported .			0

@entity11 arrested 92 times in @entity9 over the past 25 years
crimes range from theft to robbery and he has used fake identities
