president @entity0 tossed aside a long - standing ' special relationship ' between the @entity2 and @entity3 on tuesday , telling reporters that choosing a ' best ally ' between @entity6 and the @entity7 would be like choosing his favorite daughter			1
' i have two daughters , ' the president said , referring to @entity12 and @entity13			2
' and they are both gorgeous and wonderful , and i would never choose between them			2
' ' and that 's how i feel about my outstanding @entity18 partners			2
all of them are wonderful in their own ways			2
' @entity0 was speaking during a joint press conference with @entity6 president @entity23 , on the occasion of the first @entity25 by a @entity6 head of state since 1976			1
' @entity41 made no mention of @entity3 in his speech on @entity48 , but praised @entity6 , @entity53 and even @entity54			1
weeks later , @entity7 prime minister @entity34 failed to carry a vote in @entity57 authorizing the use of military force in the @entity61 country			2
the 285 – 272 vote frustrated @entity2 military leaders and politicians			2
even then , a terse @entity32 statement said the @entity0 administration would ' continue to consult ' with @entity3 , ' one of our closest allies and friends			1
' ultimately , the @entity2 called off the planned strikes			0
on tuesday , though , @entity23 was center - stage			1
' the @entity2 - @entity6 alliance has never been stronger , ' @entity0 said			1
' that 's good for @entity6			0
it 's good for the @entity2			0
it 's good for the world , because we share certain values and certain commitments and are willing to act on behalf of those commitments and values			0
' @entity0 appeared to cast aside an episode from the @entity84 administration that had @entity6 refusing to participate in a coalition effort to invade @entity86 while the @entity7 led the way			1
within weeks ' @entity6 fries ' were replaced in high profile eateries – including at least one congressional cafeteria on @entity91 – by ' freedom fries			0
' and a character on the animated comedy show @entity95 offered a label for the @entity6 that stuck : ' cheese - eating surrender monkeys			0
' @entity3 , meanwhile , enjoyed favored status in @entity36			1
then - prime minister @entity99 had famously promised after the 9/11 terror attacks in @entity101 and the @entity36 suburbs that @entity3 would stand ' shoulder to shoulder ' with the @entity2 people against a ' new evil of mass terrorism			1
' what a difference an election makes ! @entity84 and @entity99 once personified the ' special ' @entity2 - @entity7 relationship , partnering in an effort to oust @entity86 strongman @entity111 from power the @entity2 - @entity6 bilateral talks are happening on a global stage , with the very real possibility of putting @entity117 's collective nose out of joint despite his projection of a strong relationship between the @entity2 and @entity6 , @entity0 offered no word on tuesday about whether the result would be helpful to @entity117			1
a @entity6 journalist had noted that he ' actually praised @entity6 very warmly today ' and granted our president the first state visit of your second term			2
' ' does that mean that @entity6 has become the best @entity18 ally of the @entity2 and has replaced @entity3 in that role ? ' ' oh , my , ' a smiling @entity0 said , to a round of laughter			1
@entity23 followed @entity0 's lead with his own family comparison			1
' i have four children , ' he said through a translator , ' so that makes it even more difficult for me to make any choice at all			0
' ' but we 're not trying to be anyone 's favorite			2
' ' and i can see that our views converge on many issues			0
but it 's not about hierarchy ; it 's just about being useful to the world			0
' will @entity34 be pressed on @entity36 's ' special relationship ' with @entity40 during prime minister 's questions ? but the journalist 's question was n't meant to be playful			1
it continued with a more serious demand about the implications of whether @entity163 status exists between @entity36 and @entity164			0
' if so , ' came the zinger , ' why not extend to @entity6 the no - spying agreement that you have with @entity117 after the big scandal of the @entity170 ’s surveillance program ? ' @entity0 took issue with the premise of the question , cautioning that ' it 's not actually correct to say that we have a " no - spy agreement " with @entity3			1
that ’s not actually what happens			0
' ' we do n’t have – there ’s no country where we have a no - spy agreement , ' he said			0
' we have , like every other country , an intelligence capability			0
and then we have a range of partnerships with all kinds of countries			0
and we ’ve been in consultations with the @entity6 government to deepen those commitments			0

@entity0 and @entity23 took turns saying they could n't *declare* a ' *varotie* ' ally any more than they could choose a favorite child
a snub of @entity3 was in the *air* during the tuesday @entity32 press conference , as reporters asked about the two nations ' new friendship
secretary of state @entity41 famously *thumbed* his nose at @entity40 during a speech praising nations committed to military action against @entity48
