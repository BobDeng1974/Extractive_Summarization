mega mixologist @entity116 at 69 @entity7 uses a homemade horseradish vodka mixed with pepper sauce and some pepper distillate ( whatever that is ) , which seriously does the job			2
the @entity121 the @entity122 from @entity123 in @entity124 uses clear tomato water ( the juice of a tomato is actually a clear liquid , you can recreate at home with a bit of blending and a lot of straining ) and makes for a much lighter drink if your stomach is feeling delicate			1
