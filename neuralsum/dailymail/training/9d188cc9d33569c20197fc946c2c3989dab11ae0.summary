belgians are known for their chocolate and waffles , while @entity3 are famous for their rich goulash			2
but now , a global study has revealed they are among the nations with the worst diets in the world			1
meanwhile , @entity9 and @entity10 , in @entity11 , have the best diets , consuming the most fruit , vegetables , nuts and wholegrains			1
the study , which assessed the quality of diets around the world , found a rise in consumption of fruit and vegetables worldwide			1
belgians are known for their waffles and their chocolate - and now a global study has revealed @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity3 have the worst diets in the world but this rise was outpaced by an increase in the consumption of junk food			1
the study , published in @entity37 global health journal assessed the quality of diet in 197 countries , covering almost 4.5 billion adults , 90 per cent of the global population			1
between 1990 and 2010 researchers found the greatest improvements in diets in high - income nations , with small reductions in the consumption of unhealthy foods and increased intake of healthy foods like fruit and vegetables			1
despite this , people living in many of the wealthiest regions – such as the @entity56 and @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 still have some of the poorest quality diets in the world			0
this is because they have some of the highest consumption of unhealthy food worldwide , researchers said			2
in contrast , some countries in @entity11 and some countries in @entity69 – such as @entity70 and @entity71 - have seen no improvement in the quality of their diet over the past 20 years			2
the authors warn the study found a worrying picture , in which unhealthy eating habits outpaced increases in healthy eating patterns across most world regions			1
the countries with the healthiest diets overall were : 1			2
@entity92 the countries with the least healthy diets overall were : 1			2
@entity102 as part of the study , a team of international researchers analysed data on the consumption of 17 key food items and nutrients related to obesity and major diseases like heart disease , stroke , type 2 diabetes , and diet - related cancers			2
they looked at the changes in diets between 1990 and 2010 in countries around the world			0
they looked at three different diet patterns and gave each a score			0
the first was based on 10 healthy food items : fruit , vegetables , beans and legumes , nuts and seeds , whole grains , milk , total polyunsaturated fatty acids , fish , omega - 3s , and dietary fibre			0
the second was an unfavourable diet based on seven unhealthy items : unprocessed meats , processed meats , sugar - sweetened drinks , saturated fat , trans fat , dietary cholesterol , and salt			0
the third was an overall diet pattern based on all 17 food groups			0
the researchers assessed differences by country , age , sex , and national income , and gave each country a score between 0 – 100 , with a higher score indicating a healthier diet			2
they found high - income countries ate more healthy foods than low income countries , scoring 2.5 points higher on average			1
however , overall , they had substantially poorer diets due to a higher intake of unhealthy foods – the average difference in score was -33 points			1
on average , older people and women seem to consume better diets			0
people in @entity179 , @entity180 and @entity181 eat the most fruit and vegetables , while @entity184 , @entity102 and the @entity96 eat the most unhealthy and processed foods , the study found several low income countries – such as @entity9 and @entity85 scored the highest for healthy foods , while @entity188 countries like @entity29 and @entity3 and republics of the @entity190 – including @entity191 , @entity100 , and @entity192 – scored lowest for healthy foods			1
previous studies on the quality of diets worldwide had revealed large differences in quality between nations , but researchers noted such large differences were not seen in the new study , when overall diet was scored			1
the countries who scored highest for healthy foods were : 1			1
@entity210 the countries who scored highest for unhealthy foods were : 1			1
@entity214 , a @entity70 province 6			0
@entity218 dr @entity219 , of the @entity220 , who led the research , said : ' by 2020 , projections indicate that non-communicable diseases will account for 75 per cent of all deaths			0
' improving diet has a crucial role to play in reducing this burden			2
' our findings have implications for governments and international bodies worldwide			0
' the distinct dietary trends based on healthy and unhealthy foods , we highlight , indicate the need to understand different , multiple causes of these trends , such as agricultural , food industry , and health policy			1
' policy actions in multiple domains are essential to help people achieve optimal diets to control the obesity epidemic and reduce diseases in all regions of the world			0
' dr @entity249 , of @entity250 , @entity56 , and senior author on the paper , said : ' there is a particularly urgent need to focus on improving diet quality among poorer populations			0
if we do nothing , under - nutrition will be rapidly eclipsed by obesity and non-communicable diseases , as is already being seen in @entity71 , @entity70 , and other middle - income countries			0
' this analysis was performed by the @entity264 and @entity265 ( @entity266 )			0
@entity266 is an ongoing project assessing dietary information from more than 300 dietary surveys and @entity271 and @entity272 food - balance sheets across the world .			0

global study assessed diets and eating habits of 197 countries worldwide
scored each country on healthy foods , unhealthy foods , and overall diet
@entity9 , @entity10 and @entity85 , all in @entity11 , scored the highest overall
@entity28 , @entity3 and @entity29 were the least healthy countries globally
*experts* said improving diets was key to reducing global disease burden
