by @entity0 published : 10:38 est , 30 april 2012 updated : 19:04 est , 30 april 2012 they stood @entity2 - like at the water ’s edge , watching , waiting , wondering			1
all along the swollen @entity6 , at vantage points beside what used to be its banks , clutches of people gathered by the swirling tide to try to gauge whether the same murky water would be in their front rooms by daybreak			2
old hands had already donned wellies or waders and dug out the home insurance company ’s number			2
those too young to have witnessed the @entity21 of 2007 excitedly took pictures on their mobiles			1
rising tide : in scenes reminiscent of the devastating floods of 2007 , water surrounds the town of @entity29 , @entity30 , after days of torrential rain huge swathes of the @entity30 countryside have been submerged underwater after the wettest april on record going under : pictures from ground level show the extent to which @entity29 has been battered by flooding in recent days on a day when 36 flood warnings were in place across @entity41 and @entity42 and a 52 - year - old man was killed after his wife ’s car was swept into 5ft of floodwater in @entity47 , the @entity30 town of @entity29 was facing the prospect of another disaster			1
@entity51 , a veteran of the last deluge , let out a sigh as he watched the waves lap around his boots on the partly submerged road near his home			2
‘ here we go again , ’ he said			0
which might – or might not – sum up the fate that awaited the town last night as torrential rain threatened to bring more misery to a community still recovering from the devastation of five summers ago			1
the last time i came here , i drove down the @entity70 in a dumper truck with 4ft of water washing over the bucket			0
the only other way to get around was by boat			0
scores of people were trapped and hundreds of houses devastated on what became known locally as the @entity80			1
catastrophic : five years ago one of the iconic images of the widespread flooding was this shot of @entity86 surrounded by water @entity29 was turned into a virtual island after the 2007 floods , and as the @entity6 burst its banks again this year there were familiar scenes nice weather to walk the dog : @entity95 and his dog @entity97 take a stroll near the swollen banks of the @entity6 as the rising water levels showed no signs of dying down rain stops play : floodwaters rise around @entity104 as much of @entity41 and @entity42 is braced for flooding as further heavy rain continues to wreak havoc across the country cows gather after torrential rain on an island in the middle of a flooded field near @entity113 on the @entity114 to @entity115 in @entity116 so although i found nothing yesterday that mirrored flooding on the same scale , only the foolhardy would rule out the possibility of it happening again			1
swollen waters after the wettest april since records began in 1910 were expected to rise further as the @entity126 warned that ‘ heavy and intense rainfall ’ was on its way last night in many areas			1
so how were the good folk of @entity29 conducting themselves yesterday in the face of what some feared would be another @entity135 - style disaster ? well , they were mostly just getting on with life			1
‘ this is not a flood , ’ said @entity138 , 38 - year - old owner of the picturesque @entity139 , where the water had spilled over the @entity6 banks and was sloshing a few feet from her doorstep			1
‘ this is a flood , ’ she told me , pointing to a 2007 photograph of the 15th - century building partly submerged			1
to her left was a brass plaque that marked how deep the water was last time			0
it ’s screwed in several inches above waist height			0
waterlogged : farming fields in @entity30 also bore the brunt of the severe conditions which have emerged in the past week taking evasive action : sheep and livestock were also forced to move away from the rising waters amid near - identical scenes to 2007 warnings : rising levels of water have once again put @entity29 on high alert the water levels have once again crept up almost to the walls of @entity86 , with surrounding fields also in danger outside in brilliant sunshine and temperatures approaching 20c ( 68f ) , a few hardy souls and 4x4 drivers sipped beer from a table overlooking a jetty			1
only its wooden boardwalk was visible yesterday			0
a few minutes ’ drive away , in the centre of town , water was creeping towards @entity86			1
‘ that ’s just a puddle , ’ said @entity184 , an 88 - year - old ex-lorry driver			2
‘ if we do n’t get masses of rain , the water will be gone before the end of the week			0
if we do ... do n’t quote me			0
’ residents have been told that sandbags will be available from the council , but yesterday i saw none			0
there may be a kind of taboo about putting them out early , but in any case , several people told me , they are virtually useless at stopping anything more than the wash from passing vehicles			0
@entity206 , naturally , had put the covers on and a helpful chap beneath a sign that pointed to @entity29 ’s ‘ @entity210 ’ explained the water was already at table - top height			2
impact : exactly how much water has surrounded the town of @entity29 in @entity30 can been seen from the air nets : the pitch raincover was flooded and practice nets were well and truly out of use at the cricket club as floodwaters rise around @entity29 wet again : the familiar flooding has again engulfed @entity224 after forecasters recorded the wettest april on record the one thing you would n’t see anywhere yesterday was a hosepipe			1
even in what might be the wettest drought @entity29 has ever known , they ’re still banned			2
water minister @entity233 said : ‘ the sad truth is we actually need much more rain			0
’ the man killed at a flooded river ford near @entity239 , @entity47 , had not been named last night , but the couple were understood to be from @entity241 , @entity242			0
their hatchback was submerged after being swept 150 yards downstream from a flooded road			0
residents said drivers regularly got stuck after being led into the ford by satellite navigation systems			0
the 54 - year - old woman driver escaped through a window but her husband was trapped and died			2
the couple ’s dog was also killed and police are expected to investigate reports that the man had been struggling to free the terrified pet			0
the @entity259 in @entity30 – at which the @entity260 and @entity261 had been due to present a prize – have been cancelled for only the second time ever because the course is waterlogged .			1
