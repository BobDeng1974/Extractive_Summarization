anaesthetic gases used to send patients to sleep during surgery are accumulating in the @entity4 's atmosphere where they are contributing to climate change			1
scientists say they have detected the gases used in anaesthetic as far a field as @entity10 and concentrations have been rising globally in the past decade			1
the gases - desflurane , isoflurane and sevoflurane - are potent greenhouse gases that have 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide			1
anaesthetic is used to send patients to sleep during surgery ( above ) but it may also be warming the planet atmospheric scientists who have been monitoring the gases say that while the concentrations in the atmosphere are low , they are having an increasing effect on the climate			1
dr @entity30 , who led the study at the @entity32 in @entity33 , @entity34 , said the anaesthetic gases were capable of storing far more energy from the sun than carbon dioxide			1
the world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change , scientists have warned			0
researchers have found evidence that suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25 째 c per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years			0
the analysis , based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world , looked at the rate of change in 40 - year long time spans			0
over the 900 years preceding the 20th century , 40 - year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1 째 c per decade , the study found			1
but by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25 째 c per decade , give or take 0.05 째 @entity62 different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years			0
he said : ' on a kilogram - per - kilogram basis , it 's so much more poten ' modern halogenated inhalation anesthetics undergo little metabolisation during clinical application and evaporate almost completely to the atmosphere			1
' the researchers , whose work is published in the journal @entity78 , found that concentrations of desflurane reached 0.30 parts per trillion in 2014			2
@entity84 , sevoflurane and halothane have reached 0.097 , 0.13 and 0.0092 parts per trillion in the atmosphere respectively			0
by comparison , carbon dioxide gas currently makes up 400 parts per million in the atmosphere			1
however , one kilogram ( 2.2lbs ) of desflurane produces the same greenhouse effect as 2,500 kg ( 5,512lbs ) of carbon dioxide			1
the researchers estimate that anaesthetic gas emissions currently combine to produce the equivalent effect in the atmosphere of 3.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide			1
the research team did not examine the impact of nitrous oxide , another major component of anaesthetic , as it is released by many other sources			0
the researchers have been taking air samples from remote sites around the @entity108 since 2000 while they have also obtained air samples in the @entity110 and the @entity111 in @entity10			0
the gases escape through vents in operating rooms ( pictured ) when breathed out by patients and from masks the team also used two hourly measurements at a high altitude observatory at @entity120 , @entity34 since 2013 to track anaesthetic gases			2
they then used computer modelling to produce global estimates for the concentrations of these gases			2
the gases escape from hospital operating rooms via air vents during surgery			0
an estimated 280 tonnes of anaesthetic gases are used every year			2
@entity132 , an anaesthesiologist at @entity133 who reviewed the paper , said hospitals should consider using other chemicals in anaesthetic			2
she said : ' there 's nothing unique about desflurane that we ca n't do with other drugs			2
' desflurane we could live without , and every little bit makes a difference			0
' health care in and of itself in the @entity146 is one of the worst polluting industries			0
scientists say that hospitals should consider alternative anaesthetics when performing operations like above ' it generates eight percent of @entity146 greenhouse gases according to one study			1
' add to this the fact that climate change has been recognized by the @entity159 as the number one health issue of the 21st century , and it behooves us to do a better job with emissions			0
' however , @entity164 , an anaethesiologist at the @entity165 , said : ' what the report fails to note is that a major factor determining the environmental effect is the manner in which the anesthetics are used			0
' many anesthetists deliver sevoflurane or isoflurane in a two - three liters per minute flow but deliver desflurane in a lower flow - 0.5 to one liter per minute			1
' some believe that desflurane has clinical advantages that argue for its continued use			0

gases used in anaesthetic in are accumulating in the @entity4 's *atmopshere*
the gases - desflurane , isoflurane and sevoflurane - have a greenhouse effect that is 2,500 times more potent than carbon dioxide , say scientists
new study finds their concentrations are relatively low but are increasing
scientists urge hospitals to find more environmentally *friendly* alternatives
