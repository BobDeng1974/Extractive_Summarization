those hoping that the @entity1 might masquerade as something other than a one - horse race well into the @entity4 seem set to be disappointed			0
this victory for the champions , while by no means perfunctory , was the kind you normally associate with sides that are well in the groove			0
few would anticipate the wheels coming off the bogie any time soon			0
not for the first time this season , @entity14 ’s side made rather a meal of getting the job done but win they did			1
@entity19 celebrates after giving @entity20 the lead against @entity22 in the second half @entity24 finishes from close range 15 minutes into the second half at @entity27 @entity24 shoots past the helpless @entity22 keeper from close range to give @entity20 the lead @entity20 : @entity31 ; @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity19 , @entity34 ; @entity35 , @entity36 ( @entity37 46 ) , @entity38 ( commons 72 ) , @entity40 ; @entity41 , @entity42 ( @entity43 72 ) subs not used : @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 scorer ( s ) : @entity50 60 @entity22 : @entity51 ; @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 ( @entity58 80 ) , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 ( @entity62 61 ) , @entity63 ( @entity64 71 ) subs not used : @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 referee : @entity71 @entity19 ’s messy goal on the hour mark was enough to take the points although @entity20 were again thankful for the diligence of @entity31 in denying @entity22 sub @entity62 ’s spectacular late effort			1
since losing to @entity78 on home soil in early october , @entity14 ’s men have now racked up eight straight domestic victories to keep themselves alive on every front			2
if they are able to extend that happy sequence over the @entity87 period , the countdown to the clinching of a fourth successive title will begin			0
@entity24 ’s third goal in two games may have been the defining moment but the contribution of @entity38 was equally as eye - catching			1
later today , the @entity93 ’s appeal over a seven - game ban for using racist language against @entity97 defender @entity96 will be heard at @entity98 and frankly , up until this point , you had to wonder how much @entity20 would miss him if that failed			1
this was different , though			0
energised , direct and focused , the on - loan @entity104 player looked anything other than a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders			0
one who looks capable of belatedly doing something at @entity20 – if he ’s given the opportunity			1
it was the home side who got down to the business of working a goalkeeper first with @entity51 denying @entity42 a 12th goal in as many starts with a finger - tip save after the @entity121 had risen to head @entity40 ’s cross goalward			2
the @entity124 defender is congratulated by @entity38 as @entity22 's resistance is finally broken @entity31 pulled off a brilliant save low down to his right to deny @entity22 a late equaliser @entity20 's @entity34 ( right ) heads the ball as @entity63 raises his boot to try and win it hopeful that an early goal might see thistle collapse like a pack of cards , @entity19 fizzed a 25 - yarder on target but @entity51 proved up to the challenge			1
fresh from a convincing @entity140 win over @entity78 , the @entity138 men were not without their moments and @entity142 will doubtless feel he should have done better with a shot from inside the box			2
as the clock registered 30 minutes , @entity22 found the width of the crossbar separating them from a slender lead			2
@entity57 ’s in - swinging free - kick was claimed by the formidable figure of @entity60 and @entity31 looked mighty relieved as the @entity153 ’s header clipped the woodwork on its way over			0
chances for @entity20 remained plentiful			1
@entity40 forced @entity51 into another smart block after latching onto @entity24 ’s superb ball over the top , before the @entity124 fired into the ground and over from @entity38 ’s centre			1
@entity32 lashed a meaty volley two yards wide but if there was forgiveness for the @entity165 from the home support on that occasion , @entity41 felt their wrath with two poor misses in the closing moments of the first half			0
@entity20 's @entity42 is just beaten to the ball by @entity22 's @entity51 @entity42 and @entity22 's @entity53 battle for the ball during the match at @entity27 the first one was glaring			1
@entity42 was beaten to a loose ball by the advanced @entity51 only for @entity35 to pick up the scraps and recycle the ball to @entity41			0
even though two @entity22 players had regrouped on the line , the @entity181 ’s inability to hit the target from 15 yards was unforgiveable			0
before the groans had subsided , @entity41 played a perfect one - two with @entity38 yet , having done the hard part , then overran the ball			0
but just when @entity20 - by this time with @entity37 on for the stricken @entity36 – were beginning to test the patience of their fans , they struck			1
@entity35 won a foul on the right which the dependable @entity40 dropped in between the @entity22 central defenders			0
the unfortunate @entity53 , the deepest of the visitors , was unable to adjust his footing and the ball squirmed to @entity24 who dispatched it high beyond @entity51			1
@entity20 's @entity24 ( left ) wins his challenge with @entity22 's @entity53 to set up his goal @entity22 's @entity55 ( left ) attepmt to fend off the challenge of @entity20 's @entity43 @entity62 was immediately sprung from the @entity22 bench and worried @entity31 with a cute angled header that went narrowly wide			1
@entity206 and @entity43 joined the fray and both missed early opportunities to put the game to bed			2
picked out by @entity41 ’ cut - back , commons became the latest man to find @entity51 in fine form			0
@entity43 did n’t work the @entity22 man but ought to have when pouncing on a loose ball eight yards from goal			2
as news of @entity222 ’ remarkable collapse at @entity220 reverberated around the stadium , @entity20 momentarily lost their way			1
@entity62 ’s remarkable scissor - kick forced @entity31 into the save of the match and with it the points remained in the @entity229 .			0

@entity24 grabbed the only goal of the game after 60 minutes
it was @entity20 's sixth straight league win and puts them three points clear
