@entity6 , who is pictured below , and @entity7 are forced to sew tunics onto police uniforms and abide by strict morning inspections as part of their daily routines in the bleak penal colonies deep in the @entity16 mountains			1
the band members were convicted on hooliganism charges in august after performing a ' punk prayer ' at @entity21 's main cathedral in protest against president @entity23 and are serving two - year sentences			1
bleak : @entity3 bandmember @entity6 , left , alongside fellow inmates a report by @entity4 newspaper @entity27 said ms @entity6 , 23 , and bandmate @entity7 had ' successfully integrated ' into prison life - although the newspaper is believed to have given a positive spin to the lifestyle faced by the women			2
ms @entity7 is reported to have to use an outdoor toilet and , as a vegetarian , is finding it difficult to eat at the prison , in @entity38 , which is believed to have little access to fresh fruit and vegetables , the @entity33 reports			0
it is unusual for newspapers to be given access to reports from @entity4 's prisons			2
@entity38 is a region well known in @entity4 for the @entity49 camps here filled with tens of thousands of prisoners during the 1930s			2
the @entity4 government is currently trying to fend off international criticism for its treatment of the @entity3 band members , whose performance in the cathedral was captured on video and viewed hundreds of thousands of times on @entity60			1
three @entity3 members , @entity6 ( right ) , @entity7 ( centre ) and @entity63 ( left ) were jailed after staging a protest in @entity21 's main cathedral in august			0
ms @entity63 has since been released the band performed a ' punk prayer ' at @entity21 's main cathedral during which they pleaded with the @entity69 for deliverance from president @entity23 ms @entity6 's husband , @entity71 , was turned away by authorities when he tried to visit her at a prison camp in the village of @entity75 in @entity38 three members of the band were jailed initially , but one , @entity63 , was released on appeal last month , while ms @entity6 and ms @entity79 , were sent to prison camps to serve their sentences			1
prime minister @entity82 said earlier this month that he detested the @entity83 , but added the women have been in prison long enough and should be released			0
he made a similar statement before october 's appeal hearings , fueling speculation about their possible release			0
@entity82 's latest comment is unlikely to take effect , since he is widely seen as a liberal yet nominal government figure whose pledges and orders are seldom followed through on			0
the band members ' imprisonment has come to symbolise intolerance of dissent in @entity23 's @entity4 and led to strong international condemnation			1
their cause has been taken up by celebrities and musicians , including @entity104 and @entity105 , and protests have been held around the world			0
mr @entity71 said his wife has been treated well by prison officials , but he attributed that to the publicity stirred up by the trial			0

band members have *swapped* their colourful punk outfits for dour prison uniforms as they serve two - year sentences
