making his first public case for @entity5 joining a retaliatory attack on the regime of tyrant @entity15 , the prime minister said the use of chemical weapons was ‘ morally indefensible ’			1
mr @entity2 , who announced @entity18 would be recalled tomorrow to debate military action , said : ‘ what we have seen in @entity7 are appalling scenes of death and suffering because of the use of chemical weapons by the @entity15 regime			1
' i do n’t believe we can let that stand			0
’ @entity29 also appeared to back military action , saying : ‘ the murder of innocent men , women and children through the use of chemical weapons is a repugnant crime ... if we stand idly by we set a very dangerous precedent indeed			1
’ but former @entity39 chief @entity38 warned against an attack , saying it could make the conflict in @entity7 even worse			1
@entity43 , who was briefed in @entity44 yesterday , struck a more cautious note , saying @entity46 would ‘ consider ’ backing the action provided it was legal and limited			0
many @entity49 mps are also sceptical about any intervention in @entity7 ’s bloody civil war , and mr @entity2 faces a tense @entity53 vote tomorrow night			1
on another day of dramatic developments : mr @entity2 , who will chair a meeting of the @entity57 today , said a military response to last week ’s atrocity in @entity60 was ‘ not about getting involved in a @entity62 war or changing our stance in @entity7 , or going further into that conflict ’			1
‘ it ’s about chemical weapons , ’ he insisted			0
‘ their use is wrong and the world should not stand idly by			0
’ he said all the evidence suggested @entity15 was responsible for last week ’s atrocity in a @entity60 suburb , which killed hundreds and injured thousands			0
but , conscious of the mistakes of the @entity78 war , he acknowledged there was ‘ never 100 per cent certainty ’			0
@entity81 toll : a picture shows the aftermath of the chemical weapons attack in @entity60 last week mr @entity2 , who said there was evidence @entity15 had used chemical weapons at least ten times , said any attack would have to be ‘ proportionate , have to be legal , ( and ) would have to specifically be about deterring the use of chemical weapons ’			1
the @entity93 summit of world leaders in @entity95 next thursday is likely to be dominated by the @entity7 crisis			1
@entity2 and @entity97 will be in @entity98 as guests of @entity100 , who has issued a strong condemnation of any military action by the @entity103			2
@entity95 , which along with @entity104 is a staunch supporter of @entity7 dictator @entity15 , has sold him a stockpile of weapons reported to include helicopter gunships			2
in a difficult phone call on monday night , mr @entity100 told mr @entity2 there was no evidence of a chemical weapons attack			2
but the prime minister told the @entity95 president there was ‘ little doubt ’ one had been carried out by the regime ’s forces			1
@entity95 ’s foreign minister @entity119 accused the @entity103 of having ‘ engineered a media campaign to facilitate a military incursion ’			1
relations between @entity123 and the @entity124 are at a low ebb , especially since @entity127 whistleblower @entity126 was granted temporary asylum in @entity95			2
he said that a final decision on military action had not been taken			0
but his words left little doubt that he is ready to order a @entity5 submarine in the region to fire cruise missiles at targets in @entity7 as part of an allied attack			1
attorney general @entity139 has been asked to draw up a detailed legal opinion underpinning the case for military action without a @entity144 mandate			0
the @entity145 will meet tomorrow to approve the plans before the prime minister heads to the @entity53 to try to persuade mps to back the high - risk intervention			1
lord @entity38 was the latest high - profile figure to question the legality and purpose of the proposed military strike			2
describing the plans as inappropriate , he said @entity15 ’s probable use of chemical weapons , however wrong , did ‘ not constitute an open invitation for the international community to impose themselves on the internal affairs of another country ’			2
lord @entity38 , who headed the @entity5 intervention in @entity162 , said it was unclear what the military objective of the plan was , adding : ‘ we run a risk of fuelling the conflict and making it worse ’			1
conservative @entity171 , chairman of the @entity53 foreign affairs committee , said it was doubtful whether the @entity103 could legally intervene on humanitarian grounds			0
@entity7 foreign minister @entity175 denied the regime had used chemical weapons and challenged @entity178 to present proof backing up its accusations			2
he said missile strikes would play into the hands of @entity184 sympathisers fighting with the @entity7 rebels			0
he added : ‘ if we face aggression , we will defend ourselves			0
we will not hesitate to use any means available			0
’ the @entity189 said the @entity7 regime was ‘ fully responsible for the ugly crime ’			1
military might : a picture released by the @entity193 shows the guided - missile cruiser @entity195 , left , and the aircraft carrier @entity197 sailing through the @entity198 earlier this month the might of the @entity193 was seen heading towards the @entity7 coast in a photograph released yesterday			2
@entity202 supported by guided missile carrier @entity195 , moved into position ready to fire missiles into the heart of @entity60			0
@entity124 defence secretary @entity207 said yesterday the military was ‘ ready to go ’ immediately with ‘ all options ’ against the @entity7 regime			1
‘ we have moved assets in place to be able to fulfill and comply with whatever option the president wishes to take , ’ he declared			0
‘ we are prepared ... we are ready to go			0
’ the @entity215 has a crew of almost 6,000 and carries at least 90 @entity218 missiles and the @entity195 carries a mixture of 122 long and short - range missiles			0
the release of the picture , taken earlier this month by the @entity193 , came as @entity5 put a squadron of @entity225 aircraft – in the @entity62 on exercise – on standby to support any @entity228 strike			0
security at @entity5 bases in @entity231 has also been increased in case of reprisal attacks			2
more than 650 @entity234 , who are due to arrive in @entity236 late next week for an exercise with @entity124 forces , are set to be issued with chemical warfare suits and respirators as a precaution			0
