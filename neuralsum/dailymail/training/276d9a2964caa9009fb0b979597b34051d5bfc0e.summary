half of babies are at risk of suffocating in their sleep because they are put in cots with unsafe bedding , blankets and pillows			1
parents must be better informed , experts said today , after a study revealed ' too many babies ' are still at risk of sudden infant death syndrome ( @entity15 )			1
sleeping with loose bedding or soft objects poses a risk of suffocation in babies , especially those under the age of one			2
half of babies born in the @entity27 are at risk of suffocating in their sleep because they sleep with ' potentially hazardous bedding ' , the @entity24 of @entity25 found ( file picture ) although the use of blankets and other bedding has declined , around half of @entity27 infants are still placed to sleep with ' potentially hazardous bedding ' , according to the study by the @entity24 of @entity25 ( @entity37 )			1
experts investigated the type of bedding chosen by parents from 1993 to 2010 , from the @entity43 study			2
blankets , quilts and pillows can obstruct a baby 's airway and , if they become caught over a child 's head , they can cause suffocation			1
the @entity37 advises parents to put their babies to sleep in a cot with no loose bedding or soft objects , including cuddly toys , under or over the infant			1
that is not to say babies should risk feeling cold in the night			0
instead , experts advise using a firmly tucked in sheet , or a baby sleeping bag			1
@entity65 , research and information manager at @entity68 said : ' we know the safest sleeping environment for a baby is on its back in a cot or moses basket in the same room as a parent for the first six months of life			0
' we advise parents not to use loose bedding , pillows , cot bumpers or have soft toys in the cot â€“ this is because some of these items cause an accident risk and others increase the chance of @entity15 occurring			1
' this new study suggests parents are using loose bedding which is considered less safe than well - fitted blankets or a baby sleep bag			1
experts advise babies are not put to sleep with any loose quilts , pillows , blankets or cot bumpers			1
the concern is the bedding can obstruct a baby 's airways in their sleep ( file picture ) parents are advised to remove any soft toys from a baby 's cot before putting them to sleep , for fear of the toys suffocating the baby ( file picture ) sudden infant death syndrome describes the unexpected death of a baby or toddler that is initially unexplained			1
cot death was a term commonly used in the past			0
it has largely been abandoned , due to misleading suggestions that sudden infant death can only occur when a baby is asleep in a cot			1
causes of @entity15 may include accidents , infections , congenital abnormality or metabolic disorder			0
for those deaths that remain unexplained , experts believe there are likely to be undiscovered causes			0
sids statistics : source : the @entity68 and @entity141 ' it 's important that parents are given all the information about safer sleep so that they can make an informed decision			2
evidence - based advice is available on @entity68 website , www.lullabytrust.org.uk			0
' using a pillow has been shown to increase the chance of @entity15 by up to 2.5 times , the charity said			0
' a simple mattress in your cot with no loose bedding or bumpers is the safest sleeping place for a baby , ' the trust advises			0
although uncommon accidental suffocation is the leading cause of injury - related deaths in infants			0
while sudden infant syndrome deaths have declined in recent years , they still totalled around 2,000 deaths in the @entity27 2010			1
the suffocation rate doubled from 2000 to 2010 , when around 640 infants died from accidental sleep - related suffocation , @entity27 government data showed			2
meanwhile , in the @entity173 in 2012 , 221 infant deaths were attributed to sids			0
the team of researchers found that over the 17 - year period , the use of loose bedding did decline but remained a common practise			0
the rate of loose bedding use averaged around 86 per cent in 1993 to 1995 , but declined to 55 per cent in 2008 to 2010			0
teenage mothers were found to be most likely to use the dangerous bedding ( 83.5 per cent ) , while those babies born at full term were least at risk ( 55.6 per cent )			1
the study also found the at - risk bedding was most likely used for infants who slept in adult beds , those put to sleep on their sides , or babies who shared a cot or bed with others			2
the authors concluded that while the numbers have improved significantly , babies are ' still being put to bed in an unsafe sleeping environment ; about half still sleep with blankets , quilts , pillows and other hazardous items '			1
study co-author @entity208 , a @entity15 expert at the @entity209 , said these infant deaths ' are tragic and they 're just not necessary '			2
the @entity37 said it is vital parents ' know and understand the risk factors associated with this dangerous practise in order to help reduce the number of sleep - related infant deaths '			2
researchers from the @entity220 and the federal @entity221 in the @entity27 analysed telephone surveys involving a total of nearly 20,000 parents			0
the study was published today in the journal @entity25 .			0
