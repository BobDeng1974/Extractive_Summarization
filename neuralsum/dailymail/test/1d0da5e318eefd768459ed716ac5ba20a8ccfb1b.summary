@entity0 and @entity1 first met at a dinner party , hosted by the woman he was ' secretly ' dating relish the scene			1
a dinner party in @entity7			1
the hostess : @entity9 , the glamorous then economics editor of @entity11 's @entity10			1
the guests : young barristers and would - be politicians			0
@entity16 to the party that night back in march 2004 was @entity9 ' boyfriend , @entity17 rising star @entity0			1
at the time , he was chief economics adviser to the chancellor , @entity18			0
@entity1 had been back in @entity19 for two months after a brief spell as a lecturer at @entity22 in the @entity23 ever the policy nerd , the son of a @entity27 professor waxed lyrical about economic theory			1
as he held court , a young woman called @entity1 , who was sitting across the table and whom he had never met before , became transfixed			1
a clever young environmental lawyer , she had been invited by @entity9 — the brilliant daughter of @entity35 , of the @entity36 and @entity37 musical comedy duo @entity39			1
yesterday , @entity1 recalled in a red - top newspaper : ' i thought he was good - looking and clever and seemed to be unattached			1
but we just went down a conversation @entity44			0
apparently we had nothing in common			0
' he just wanted to talk about economics — one of my least favourite subjects			0
none of our conversations went anywhere			0
' mrs @entity1 said that she was ' furious ' when — far from being ' unattached ' — she found out that he was ' secretly going out with ' the woman who had invited her for dinner			1
fast - forward more than 11 years and the @entity59 have since had two children , married and believe they are less than a month away from moving house with their family to no 10 @entity64			0
but the story of the pair 's first meeting offers a fascinating insight into the somewhat caddish character of the @entity70			0
the story emerged yesterday when mrs @entity1 gave an interview to the @entity17 - supporting @entity86			1
clearly she was guided by @entity17 spin doctors , who wanted to give the impression to voters that her husband was a touchy - feely human being , rather than the soulless nerd that his awkward image conveys on tv			2
the simpering headline of the article ran : ' @entity0 bandaged me up after i was bitten by a doberman			2
and i fell in love			0
' @entity1 told how , during the 2005 election campaign , @entity0 had come to her rescue after she was bitten by the dog			1
it happened when they were putting leaflets through letter - boxes in houses in @entity109 , @entity110			0
' @entity111 bandaged me and i fell in love with him , ' said @entity1			2
former partners of mr @entity0 include @entity115 ( left ) and fellow political aide @entity116 ( right ) after their first meeting at that 2004 dinner party , it was at least a year before they started dating			1
@entity1 's recollection is n't , though , the first public airing of her love story with @entity125 in the biography of the @entity17 leader , titled @entity0 : the @entity59 and @entity129 , an associate is quoted as saying : ' although she was struck by his eyes — wide and brown and fixed on their subject — a friend remembers her undoubted excitement after meeting @entity0 as : ' gosh , how fascinating , he 's really clever ' , rather than : ' gosh , how handsome '			1
' perhaps glossing over what may be seen as such caddish behaviour , the @entity86 omitted to say that the dinner 's hostess , @entity9 ( who later left the @entity11 for a £ 400,000 - a - year job at a bank in the @entity142 ) , was @entity0 's then girlfriend			1
it was left to @entity144 's biographer @entity143 to let the cat out of the bag after reading the @entity86 story , when he tweeted : ' @entity1 on clandestine @entity149 has @entity86 not named the host of that dinner ? it was @entity9			1
' @entity9 ( pictured ) , a former girlfriend of mr @entity0 , hosted the dinner party where he first met his future wife considering that she , at the time , was economics editor of @entity157 's flagship @entity10 , @entity143 added : ' could the secrecy have been because he was a @entity159 special adviser and @entity9 was a @entity11 economics journalist ? ' what 's more , there is another intriguing twist to this story of high politics and high economics			1
for two years ago , @entity0 ungallantly blurted out , during an interview with a celebrity magazine , that not only had he romanced @entity9 but that his close @entity17 colleague and @entity169 , @entity170 , had had a relationship with her , too			1
@entity1 said : ' we did both date her but there was a long time apart between me and @entity9 and i do n't have any problems running into each other now			1
' for her part , @entity9 had no forewarning of @entity1 's revelation and restricted her response to curtly dismissing her relationship with him as having been ' very brief and a very long time ago '			1
however , her relationship with balls , a decade earlier , was more serious			0
they met in 1989 at @entity22 , where they were both @entity188 scholars after having graduated from @entity189			0
it was while they were working at the @entity192 as leader writers that their friendship blossomed into a serious relationship			0
the way these relationships intertwined also highlights the deeply incestuous and narrow world of the @entity17 high command			2
for it was n't just @entity202 , but others , too , who had close personal relationships			0
of course , @entity170 is now married to fellow shadow cabinet minister @entity205			0
all four studied @entity206 ( @entity206 ) at @entity189			0
@entity207 and @entity9 were tutorial partners and @entity188 scholars at @entity22			2
@entity1 also studied at @entity22			2
@entity207 once shared a house with @entity1 ( who apparently had a few other girlfriends )			2
and she met balls when they both worked at the @entity192 but back to @entity0 's tangled love - life			1
for several years in the mid- 1990s , when he was working as an adviser to the then - shadow chancellor @entity18 , he went out with fellow political aide , @entity116 ( a @entity216 graduate )			0
she worked for a time for @entity144 , who described her in his memoirs as ' an @entity219 rose , intellectually able and blue stocking or red stocking according to the occasion '			0
in the summer of 1995 , she and @entity1 went on holiday to the south of @entity225			2
they stayed in the family home of one of @entity1 's first girlfriends , @entity115 ( the daughter of an @entity231 political economist and who went on to marry the late tycoon @entity232 , who gave £ 1 million to the @entity233 )			2
at the time , @entity115 was dating the @entity235 journalist @entity234 ( who went on to write speeches for @entity144 )			2
it was clearly a busman 's holiday , as much of the discussion among the group was about the national minimum wage which was a @entity17 policy			2
after breaking up with @entity116 , mr @entity0 had a brief relationship with the journalist @entity243 ( pictured ) ' we discussed it like we were in a @entity247 seminar , ' recalled @entity234			1
' i remember being in the kitchen and listening to @entity0 having a conversation about it in real detail			2
' @entity1 's relationship with @entity254 continued when @entity144 became pm			2
her job at @entity257 meant she sat next to her lover 's elder brother @entity258 , who was a key figure in the @entity64 policy unit			0
after breaking up with @entity254 , @entity0 had a brief relationship with the journalist @entity243 , who then worked for @entity263			0
ms @entity243 , who some years later became a single parent , also had a fling with her then coke - snorting @entity192 colleague @entity266 , who is now @entity1 's chief spin doctor			0
what a deliciously small and privileged world ! one that is a million miles from the lives of millions of ordinary voters			0
and so back to @entity0 and @entity1			1
the next time they met after his questionable behaviour at his then girlfriend @entity9 ' dinner party was in the months leading up to him becoming an mp			1
later , she helped campaign for him in @entity279 during the 2005 election by moving chairs around for a public meeting			0
no more mr @entity283 : @entity1 's interview in yesterday 's @entity17 - supporting mirror some months after , @entity1 planned a holiday with a woman barrister friend , @entity287 , to @entity288 to see the @entity290 ruins			1
however , after it was booked , @entity1 said she wanted to go , instead , with @entity0			1
their relationship had consolidated further by the time @entity1 was appointed @entity294 in the @entity18 government			1
not only had their personal lives meshed , but their professional ones , too , as @entity1 ( who was a member of the @entity233 ) had written a book on the environment			0
a few years later they had the first of their two children — and then decided to get married ( in may 2011 )			0
this week , by happily putting the spotlight on her husband 's past love affairs , @entity1 must be hoping that the result will be to portray him as a dashing romantic figure			0
however , many voters — particularly women — may see him in a less attractive light .			0

@entity1 reveals how she met future @entity17 leader at dinner party
but she was ' furious ' when she discovered he was dating the party hostess
mr @entity0 was at the time seeing @entity10 editor @entity9
she was just a number of women he dated from the same privileged clique
