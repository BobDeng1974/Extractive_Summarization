in @entity1 , many girls are forbidden from riding bicycles - they are , however , allowed to ride skateboards			2
so when @entity6 skateboarder @entity5 created @entity7 , a non-profit organization that aims to connect youth in @entity1 with education through skateboarding , it should n't have been a surprise that 40 per cent of the program 's students would be girls			1
in 2012 , photographer @entity15 decided to take pictures of these @entity18 skater girls , and her work was recently on display at a gallery in @entity22			2
in fact , ms. @entity15 said she believes the reason skateboarding has been received so differently in @entity1 than in other countries is precisely because it was new to the region			0
' when skateboarding arrived in @entity1 , it did n't have any preconceived images for them			0
they did n't know what it was , ' she said , while adding that it was only accepted after it became clear that it was just ' a toy to have fun with '			0
safety first : while the girls were conservatively dressed , they did n't forgo safety measures like wearing helmets and knee pads little ladies who skate : ms. @entity15 said she was fascinated with just how immaculate one girl , left , was , considering how dusty the skateboard facilities were this sport knows no gender : 40 per cent of @entity7 's students are female ; the girls also have the option of joining a back - to - school program now , its the top sport for girls in the country , who are able to ride freely in dresses and other clothing that can be restrictive when playing other sports			1
when ms. @entity15 visited the @entity7 facilities in 2012 , she quickly noticed their confidence and the joy they took in learning			1
she took pictures of them with natural light , capturing them in dresses , pants , headscarves and sneakers as they happily played on skateboards			0
' i captured about nine in total , ' she told the @entity95 , recalling one girl whose father had initially told her she could n't join the skateboarding program			2
he finally relented after she would n't stop begging him			0
girls will be girls : ms. @entity15 said she was struck by the girls ' confidence and how happy they were to skateboard unconventional athletic gear : the style of dress required by girls can make it difficult to play other sports , but luckily it does n’t tend to interfere with their skateboarding ' i met so many impressive women and girls in @entity1 : a teacher as tough and determined as any man ; young @entity1 in their early twenties who were volunteering at an orphanage and were passionate about being seen as strong and willing to fight for themselves , rather than as victims of circumstance ; and girls who were being educated to be leaders in their communities and who were already thinking carefully about their own and their country ’s future , ' ms. @entity15 said			0
that education is a top priority for @entity7 , as many children in @entity29 from low - income families are forced to drop out of school to earn money			1
besides being taught to skateboard , the program 's participants are also invited to join a free back - to - school program to help them get back on track with their education .			1
