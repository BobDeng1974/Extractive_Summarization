blinking rapidly as judge @entity19 passed sentence , the @entity18 judge told her that abiding by the plea agreement would have been an affront to justice			1
@entity25 , behind glass , reacts to being sentenced to 10 years in prison wednesday may 1 , 2013 , in @entity18 , @entity2 , for the 1957 death of her six - month - old daughter ' what happened to @entity29 was no accident			1
it was caused by the defendant 's reckless actions , ' said judge @entity19			1
@entity9 had pleaded no contest in february to a charge of second - degree murder stemming from the 1957 death of her 6 - month - old daughter			1
at the time , @entity29 's death was ruled an accident but the case was reopened in 2008 after @entity9 's son came forward with allegations of horrific child abuse			1
under questioning by investigators , @entity9 acknowledged throwing @entity29 roughly on the couch , causing her to bounce to the floor			1
the grandmother ( left ) entered a no - contest plea to the charges of murdering her daughter @entity29 ( right ) on the understanding that she would receive a shorter sentence when the sentence was handed down an audible gasp filled the courtroom			1
@entity9 , who had been occasionally dabbing her eyes and nose with a wadded - up tissue , closed her eyes and then blinked rapidly several times			1
defense attorney @entity60 told reporters afterward he was surprised by the sentence			0
' if we could do it all over again , we 'd have a trial and we 'd win , ' @entity60 said			0
a number of @entity9 's relatives tried to persuade the judge that @entity9 already had been punished enough through decades of knowing what happened to her baby			1
@entity25 , right behind glass , reacts as her sister , @entity72 , tries to hold her hands through the glass judge @entity19 sentenced @entity9 to a maximum of 10 years in prison he promised to initiate an appeal thursday morning , in part on the basis of the sentencing process			1
he noted that the pre-sentencing report raised allegations that @entity9 also physically and emotionally abused her other children decades ago , even though the statute of limitations on those abuse claims would have run out			2
he said those allegations should n't have been relevant for the purpose of sentencing			0
@entity9 likely will be granted parole when she becomes eligible in 2 1/2 years , district attorney @entity90 said the case presented a number of quandaries for prosecutors			2
@entity9 would have had to be tried for second - degree murder , a now - outdated charge , under the standards in play at the time of the 1957 crime			1
the obligations would include proving the defendant had a ' depraved mind , ' a term so vague it was impossible to predict how jurors would interpret it in 2013			0
@entity90 noted other reasons why the case would be difficult to prosecute			0
key witnesses had died , memories had faded and jurors were likely to see @entity9 as a sympathetic maternal or grandmotherly figure			2
so he worked out a plea agreement calling for a lenient sentence , knowing the judge would probably overrule him with a much tougher punishment			2
he and @entity60 each recommended a sentence of 45 days in jail and 10 years of probation			0
but a judge is not bound by plea agreements , and @entity19 did override this one			1
@entity25 , ( right ) , is taken into custody after being sentenced to 10 years in prison on wednesday for the 1957 death of her six - month - old daughter ' anything but incarceration would diminish the seriousness of the offense , ' @entity19 said			1

later , she stood at the clear plastic partition separating her from her supporters , their hands pressed against opposite sides of the window as if to touch one last time			0
eventually @entity9 was led weeping from the courtroom			2
supporters who reached out to touch her were nudged away by deputies			0
@entity9 's case was delayed several times after she was charged in 2011			1
her mental - health status was in question but a judge ultimately decided she was competent to assist in her defense			0
an initial autopsy found that @entity29 suffered two brain hemorrhages , a partially collapsed lung and three scalp bruises			0
however the death was ruled accidental			0
the baby 's death haunted @entity29 's older brother , @entity161 , now 57			2
he says he grew up traumatized because his mother always told him he was to blame for his baby sister 's death because the girl fell while @entity25 was distracted by his misbehavior			0
a @entity2 woman accused of killing her baby more than 50 years ago showed up at her sentencing hearing wednesday expecting to be sentenced to 45 days in jail as part of a plea agreement forged between lawyers @entity161 eventually told police in 2008 of abuse he suffered at the hands of his mother			2
he told investigators she often beat and choked him and kicked him with steel - toed boots			0
he said his mother broke his arm and nose , and described how she covered the head of his mentally challenged younger brother , @entity184 , and struck the wailing boy 's toes one by one with a hammer			0
@entity60 said those events either never happened or that @entity9 's now - deceased husband was the actual abuser			1
