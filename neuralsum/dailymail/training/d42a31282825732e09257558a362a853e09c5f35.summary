after @entity1 became the latest in a long line of defenders who have suffered in the line of duty , we look at the top ten nastiest knocks that will make you think twice about appearing in your local team 's rearguard this coming weekend			1
footballers have a reputation of being overly pampered , well accustomed to feigning injury , and not being keen on the physicality of yesteryear			0
however , fortunately on rare occasions , we are all reminded of the dangers of professional sport , and we are forced to reevaluate our perceptions , with the disturbing images of @entity1 's clash with a post against @entity23 at @entity25 prime example			1
in no particular order , we look at the ten of the worst injuries defenders have suffered down the years to help remember the sacrifices some our our idols have made			1
@entity32 , @entity35 v @entity33 , september 1989 @entity32 after his heroics against @entity33 in a @entity38 qualifier - one of football 's iconic images it is one of the most iconic images of our time , and whenever a player 's bravery or extra effort for the cause is mentioned , it immediately evokes memories of @entity32 's blood - soaked @entity35 shirt after an heroic display against @entity33 in 1989			2
the match is question was pivotal to @entity35 and boss @entity55			0
the @entity35 needed a draw to qualify for the @entity38 in @entity57 , but the plucky @entity58 represented tough opposition			2
however , predominantly thanks to @entity32 's solid display , despite suffering a nasty head wound that needed heavy bandaging and changed the colour of his jersey a darker shade of red , @entity35 held out for a 0 - 0 draw , and all of our memories of @entity73 crying , @entity75 's late , late equaliser and more penalty heartache at @entity38 exist as a result			1
@entity78 , @entity80 v @entity79 , @entity81 , february 2007 @entity78 is stretchered off after a sickening injury in the 2007 @entity81 final against @entity79 literally the definition of putting your neck on the line , @entity78 did his utmost to keep the scores level in the 2007 @entity81 final as the ball dropped in @entity80 's penalty area , but as he flung his head in the way of @entity97 's boot , the @entity79 midfielder followed through and caught @entity78 on the side of the head			1
that is obviously dangerous territory for any sportsman , but luckily enough , despite being employed by the opposition , @entity79 physio @entity103 rushed to the @entity80 skipper 's aid , and , it was later revealed , helped clear @entity78 's windpipe which had become blocked			2
the sickening images of @entity78 slipping out of consciousness were stark reminder of what can happen in the blink of an eye			0
@entity115 , @entity116 v @entity80 , october 1998 former @entity116 defender @entity115 was the victim of one of the most eye - watering injuries in history for the male population of this country , this is the injury that hits home the most , and the clip still proves difficult to watch in its entirety even to this day			1
hurtling in at break - neck speed as @entity80 's @entity128 rounded @entity116 goalkeeper @entity129 and fired the ball goalward , @entity115 was just too late			2
however , as the net bulged , @entity115 's slide was halted only by the post , with a leg either side , and the eye - watering images still resonate today			2
@entity138 , @entity139 , november 1993 @entity138 had to wear this protective mask after being elbowed by @entity141 in 1993 strikers in the 1990 's loved to throw their arms in the face of defenders in their backs , before referees began clamping down on such brutality			2
@entity149 ' @entity141 loved leaving the flailing elbow in more than most , but his attack on @entity139 captain @entity138 in @entity153 ' clash with the artist formerly known as @entity139 bordered on assault			0
@entity141 's swing of his right arm actually fractured @entity138 's skull , and meant the @entity153 skipper had to wear this protective mask for several weeks			0
@entity160 , @entity23 v @entity161 , april 2005 somehow @entity161 captain @entity160 managed to carry on after this injury against @entity23 the @entity163 revealed rugby ’s fears over concussion earlier this year			1
@entity167 , @entity38 winner and former @entity35 captain , launched @entity163 ’s campaign for action over the alarming rise of concussion in rugby			1
if you have experience of concussion in a rugby match , let us know by emailing campaign@mailonsunday.co.uk			0
a lesser - known injury , but one that sticks on the memory of @entity184 clashes from @entity161 's time in the @entity186			0
against an attacking @entity23 side , the visitors were under the cosh right from the word go , but skipper @entity160 lead by example , and kept the @entity194 at bay			0
the determined centre - back took a nasty knock to the head , but was determined to carry on , and @entity160 was patched up and helped his team secure a 0 - 0 stalemate			2
@entity201 , @entity116 v @entity79 , december 2014 @entity201 released this picture of the staples he needed following connection with @entity206 's boot made more impressive after heading a late equaliser despite being bandaged up , @entity201 had to have staples in his wound after being trodden on against @entity79 at @entity210			1
the @entity211 looked to be in trouble after being caught by @entity206 's boot , but soldiered on and grabbed the headlines			0
@entity201 also required staples in a head wound in january 2014 following a clash with @entity218 's @entity217 during an @entity220 tie			1
@entity221 , @entity222 v @entity139 , february 2009 @entity221 suffers yet another injury and misses out on a cup final after this knock against @entity222 notoriously unlucky with injuries , @entity221 's jinx struck again as he was ruled out of @entity139 's @entity81 final clash with @entity229 after picking up this head injury			1
@entity221 's collision with his own team - mate @entity232 ended with the former @entity35 defender leaving the field and needing stitches			0
but once again , @entity221 missed another key game as the head injury kept him out of the final five days later			0
@entity237 , @entity238 v @entity239 , august 2012 nasty images of @entity237 's head injury made their way around social media in @entity244 , generating much support another example of team - mates clashing , @entity246 defender @entity237 came off worse from an aerial collision with @entity238 goalkeeper @entity250 in @entity238 ' clash with @entity239 , and ended up spending the night in hospital			1
the images were broadcast around @entity244 , and caused several colleagues to offer their support			0
@entity257 defender @entity256 was one of those stars to send their well wishes , tweeting : ' i just saw the images on tv			0
hopefully it 's nothing serious and that you will play soon ! # @entity267			0
' @entity268 , @entity269 v @entity270 , @entity38 semi-final , july 2014 @entity268 was the victim of several tough tackles against @entity270 in @entity273 @entity38 the @entity38 produced several encounters rife with physicality , but @entity268 's treatment at the hands of the @entity270 in july 's @entity38 semi-final stands out			2
one particular clash led to the fearless centre - back collapsing to the ground , with images of team - mates and the @entity269 coaching staff 's panic exemplifying the seriousness of the injury			0
thankfully , @entity268 made a full recovery after a long delay , but the whole episode was proof even the toughest of competitors are not immune			0
@entity1 , @entity23 v @entity293 , december 2014 @entity1 's sickening injury caused a long delay in sunday 's @entity296 at @entity25 the reason the issue of head injuries has come to the fore once again , @entity1 's clash with the post at @entity25 proved difficult to watch for all involved			1
one of the toughest characters around , @entity1 could n't avoid running head - on into the post , with the noise on impact one of the most difficult aspects for those close by to deal with			1
luckily , @entity1 managed to get to his feet , but the scars will take some healing after such a nasty injury .			1
