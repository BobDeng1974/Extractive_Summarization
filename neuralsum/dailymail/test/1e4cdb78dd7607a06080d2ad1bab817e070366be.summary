usually a highlight of @entity1 , @entity3 's name is a notable absence from the schedule in 2015			1
the designer revealed in february that he would not be presenting a collection at the @entity9 event this week , and revealed to @entity10 on sunday that he was enjoying ' taking a breather '			0
despite this year marking the 20th anniversary of @entity1 , @entity3 is taking in the fashions from the comfort of the front row , after focusing on his international efforts of late			1
' my team and i just need a bit of a breather - we 've just finished selling in @entity22 , and we 've had an incredible season over there , so we 're busy focusing on international at the moment , ' @entity3 told @entity10 at the @entity27 show on first night of @entity30			2
' i would n’t be standing here talking to you if we were showing on monday or tuesday , ' he laughs			0
this is only the second @entity30 the design powerhouse has missed in two decades			2
when asked if he will miss the excitement of running his own show , @entity3 said while he loves it , he 's happy to sit back and see it from a new perspective			1
' the chances i do get , i love to take in the whole thing , my eyes will be wide open as i sit in the front row , ' he says			2
' because i 'm not presenting a show i can really look forward to supporting some of my friends like @entity50 ( @entity51 ) and @entity52 ( @entity53 from by @entity52 ) they 're my two faves i 'm specifically wanting to see			0
' fashion favourite : @entity3 says @entity51 ( pictured left ) is one of his favourite designers showing this week on @entity51 's show , @entity3 says she had a great cast of models and knew the fashion would be beautiful and all about showcasing shape and new directions			1
as for what he sees trending this season , @entity3 said the @entity66 market is so diverse , anything could happen			2
' there are so many different designers with so many styles now , it ’s not like it was 50 years ago when skirts are to the knee or something like that , there are so many handwritings , so i think it will all become really apparent after we see them this week			0
' ' someone like @entity50 is so incredibly on point internationally at the moment which is her style , but then @entity52 is going to give us some fun , sexy tight stuff			0
' fashion flashback : showing since 1996 , this marks the second time in twenty years @entity3 wo n't show model moment : @entity3 with @entity91 ( pictured left ) who previously starred in @entity66 's @entity94 @entity3 also believes the @entity66 market has it 's on unique flair , different to fashion internationally that has a more uniform look			1
' we definitely have our own signature			0
i would n't say relaxed even though people say that all the time , it ’s more we have a different take on fashion			0
there 's a mix of designers that are increadibly accomplished then there are younger designers who take more risks and challenges , ' he says			0
' and at the same time you can @entity66 designers anywhere in the world and it stands up in any country you go to and people are intrigued by it when they see girls wearing it			0
' taking a break from the runway , @entity3 now is devoting his time to international enterprises , with a specific focus on the @entity129 and @entity130 market			1
front row fashionistas : @entity3 front row alongside @entity134 's @entity133 ( left ) and @entity135 ( right ) ' @entity129 is a big expansion market and the @entity130 is huge , it ’s had unprecedented growth in so while i ’m doing stuff in @entity66 i ’m also doing things that resonate in those regions to build brand profile in those countries			1
' for @entity3 who also is a judge on @entity146 , this also will include more work in tv overseas			0
he has currently filmed production for @entity129 ’s @entity94 which is said to broadcast to over 11 million homes in @entity129 and @entity130 via the @entity151 and he 's also looking into more tv opportunities there but ca n't go into the specifics yet			1
@entity155 : @entity3 with @entity156 ( left ) who guest stars in this year 's @entity146 from a-list to @entity129 : @entity3 has just filmed @entity129 's @entity94 and plans to work on more tv projects in @entity129 as for his fashion empire , @entity3 believes despite his work in tv , as well as linen and @entity168 lines , fashion is his first and foremost love and while he admits he wo n't stop at one thing , everything has to have synergy with his fashion brand			1
' tv stuff gets a lot of press , but in reality i ’m a fashion designer and it ’s all about the credibility of clothes , so i ’m really focused on that because that propels everything else			2
