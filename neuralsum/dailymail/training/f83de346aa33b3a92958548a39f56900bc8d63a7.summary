@entity1 chairman @entity0 has described @entity2 as a high - maintenance coach with a ' huge ego '			1
@entity0 hired the current @entity6 manager in 2009 , and @entity7 subsequently led @entity1 to a league and cup double in his first year in charge , missing out on a treble by losing the @entity13 final to @entity14			1
he was dismissed towards the end of his second season in charge with @entity1 sitting fourth in the @entity18 and already out of the @entity19 , bringing to an end a relationship which had not always been easy according to the @entity1 chairman			1
' @entity2 was not always easy - care			2
he wanted to ' @entity42 ' our club			0
he has a huge ego			1
' @entity0 did pay tribute to a ' good and successful coach ' , but claimed that current coach @entity48 is a much better fit for the club			1

although both transfers were controversial - the first for its timing on the eve of @entity68 's @entity13 semi-final against @entity74 and the second being one of the game 's worst - kept secrets with @entity1 agreeing terms with the @entity80 striker even before they were permitted to speak to him - @entity0 says they did @entity41 football a favour			1
