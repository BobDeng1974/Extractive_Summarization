@entity0 said he was left ' shocked ' and in ' disbelief ' when the bakery refused his order a @entity5 baker who refused to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan has begun a court battle over equality laws			1
@entity11 - based @entity10 refused to make a cake featuring an image of @entity15 puppets @entity16 below the motto ' @entity18 '			1
@entity20 's @entity19 is now supporting a legal action against the family - run bakery on behalf of gay rights activist @entity0 , whose order was declined			1
mr @entity0 told a court today he was left ' shocked ' and in ' disbelief ' when one of the owners of the bakery , @entity29 , rang him and told him she would not be processing the order he had already paid for			1
' it made me feel i 'm not worthy , a lesser person and to me that was wrong , ' he said			0
opening the case , @entity35 , representing mr @entity0 , said the baker 's objection on religious grounds was not lawful			1
he said baking a cake did not mean the bakers supported any message the cake might carry and compared the baking of a cake to a postman delivering a letter or a printer printing a poster			2
' a postman taking a letter to the door or a printer carrying out a printing job - nobody would say that involved promoting or support , ' he said			0
' it 's simply a functional relationship , a working relationship			0
' the lawyer also noted the publicity around the case and highlighted that politicians , church figures , bloggers and others had expressed opinions on the matter			1
but the barrister insisted the case must be judged on the facts alone , saying : ' law must not be determined by those who shout loudest			2
' mr @entity35 said he was not in court to challenge the @entity76 family 's faith and highlighted that the proposed design would not have had an @entity10 logo on it			1
the case is being heard at @entity81 by district judge @entity82			2
the @entity19 , which monitors compliance with equality laws in the region , has alleged that the stance of the company was in breach of legislation			2
the case has sharply divided public opinion in @entity20 and beyond			2
in the wake of the bakery 's refusal to provide the service last may , the commission , a state - funded watchdog body , took on the case on behalf of mr @entity0			1
initially , the commission asked the bakery to acknowledge that it had breached legislation and offer ' modest ' damages to the customer			2
claims of discrimination were made after a @entity5 - run bakery in @entity20 refused to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan on it on religious grounds			1

pictured , right : @entity11 councillor @entity112 cutting the cake which was eventually made by another bakery @entity10 bakery general manager @entity76 , supported by his wife @entity115 ( right ) , has said he is fighting the case to allow @entity5 business owners to follow their beliefs in how they run their firms when @entity121 , which is owned by the @entity76 family , refused , the commission proceeded with the legal action			1
outlining his view of the facts , mr @entity35 said mr @entity0 had used the bakery in @entity129 in @entity130 ' regularly ' before the incident			0
he said his client had seen a leaflet in the shop advertising a service whereby images could be printed in edible icing on a cake			0
he said there was nothing on the leaflet which suggested a limitation on the service due to ' religious scruples '			0
the barrister told the court that the order was accepted by @entity10 director @entity29 and mr @entity0 paid for it in full			0
' a contract was therefore concluded , ' he said			0
mr @entity35 said that , over the next few days , mrs @entity29 expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter - in - law , @entity115 , and the matter was then discussed with her son , @entity153			0
after that mr @entity0 was informed that his order would not be processed due to the family 's religious views , said the lawyer			1
a court was told that for the bakery to refuse to make the cake was like a postman refusing to deliver letters mr @entity35 said if companies were allowed to break contracts with individuals then ' the law is worth nothing '			1
he added : ' the rule of law says there shall be no discrimination in the commercial sphere			0
' the barrister insisted that @entity121 was not an ' explicitly religious ' business and referred to an interview @entity76 gave to a newspaper in which he claimed the majority of his 60 - plus workforce were unaware of his family 's faith			2
mr @entity35 stressed the importance of anti-discrimination legislation in @entity20 , given its history of sectarian strife			0
@entity153 and @entity184 sat on one side of an almost packed courtroom , with mr @entity0 watching from the other side			0
the @entity189 case has prompted the @entity190 to propose a law change at @entity192 that would provide an ' equality clause ' which would essentially enable businesses to refuse to provide certain services on religious grounds			1
mr @entity76 has previously said : mr @entity76 has previously insisting that @entity197 should be able to apply their beliefs to the day - to - day running of their businesses			0
he said : ' i would like the outcome of this to be that any @entity197 running a business could be allowed to follow their @entity5 beliefs and principles in the day - to - day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that			1
mr @entity76 , with his wife @entity115 and daughter @entity210 , sat in court today to hear the legal argument			0
