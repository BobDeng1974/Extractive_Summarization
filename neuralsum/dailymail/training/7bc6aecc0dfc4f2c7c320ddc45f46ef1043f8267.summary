@entity0 , the @entity1 striker who scored 60 goals in the 1927 - 28 @entity4 season , was once asked whether his record would ever be broken			1
' i think it will , ' the @entity7 reportedly said			0
' but there 's only one man who 'll do it			0
that 's the fellow that walks on the water			0
i think he 's about the only one			0
' eighty - six years on , though , and @entity19 striker @entity18 is on course to surpassing that tally , having already scored seven goals in his first four games			1
at that scoring rate , the 25 - year - old is scheduled to end the season on 66 goals			1
@entity18 celebrates one of his three strikes for @entity19 against @entity29 on saturday the @entity31 striker now has seven goals in just four games for @entity19 in his debut season at the club 60 - @entity0 ( @entity1 , 1927 - 28 ) 59 - @entity36 ( @entity37 , 1926 - 27 ) 55 - @entity38 ( @entity39 , 1936 - 37 ) - @entity40 ( @entity41 , 1936 - 37 ) 52 - @entity42 ( @entity43 , 1960 - 61 ) it is all hypothetical , of course			1
but it still gives hope to those at @entity48 after years of cursed strikers			0
@entity50 , @entity51 and many more have failed			0
yet with @entity18 there 's never a dull moment			2
the @entity31 striker 's extraordinary start to life in the @entity58 has catapulted him to become odds - on favourite to win the @entity61 with many bookmakers , according to @entity63			1
@entity18 's nearest challenger is @entity65 at 10/1			2
@entity67 's own acquisition , @entity68 , has been made third favourite at 14/1 , despite a seven - goal deficit to overturn already			0
@entity18 is hoping to join @entity0 ( left ) and @entity71 ( right ) in setting goalscoring records for a season also within @entity18 's sights is the single - season @entity58 goal record			1
@entity71 and @entity76 hold the record for a 42 - game season with 34 goals for @entity79 and @entity80 respectively , meaning @entity18 is 27 shy of that total at present			1
@entity71 also holds the joint record for a 38 - game @entity58 season ( the top flight was reduced from 22 to 20 teams for the 1995 - 6 term )			1
the former @entity89 captain notched 31 goals for @entity79 in 1995 - 6 , a total matched by @entity92 at @entity67 in 2007 - 8 and @entity93 for @entity94 last season			1
@entity18 is now 24 goals short of that illustrious trio			2
@entity1 heroes @entity98 and @entity100 stand next to the @entity0 statue outside @entity102 @entity0 runs out for @entity1 in 1936 ( left ) and climbs high to head a ball in action for the @entity1 ( right ) in 42 - game season 34 - @entity76 ( @entity80 , 1993 – 94 ) - @entity71 ( @entity79 , 1994 – 95 ) in 38 - game season 31 - @entity71 ( @entity79 , 1995 – 96 ) - @entity92 ( @entity67 , 2007 – 08 ) - @entity93 ( @entity94 , 2013 – 14 ) there has been no adjustment period needed for @entity18 and little sign of a supposedly suspect hamstring			1
@entity109 looks like stopping the predator who scored 36 goals last season as @entity113 won the @entity115 title and reached the @entity117 final			2
@entity18 , rewarded for his super start with the @entity120 accolade , proved last term was no fluke after netting against @entity123 and @entity124 in his opening two games in @entity89			2
he scored twice - and proved a real menace - in the 6 - 3 win over @entity1 at @entity102 , before clinically putting three past @entity29 at @entity48 to maintain @entity19 's 100 per cent record so far			1
@entity129 refused to bite after that game , though			0
the special one would not confirm @entity18 as the answer to prayers that so often emerged from @entity48 last season , nor will he expect too much			2
nevertheless , @entity129 humoured us			0
' if the team plays well , he has to score goals , ' said the @entity138 boss			0
@entity92 puts the ball past @entity141 goalkeeper @entity140 in september 2007 @entity76 scores against @entity19 with a brilliant left - footed shot at @entity143 in 1994 @entity71 's trademark celebration was seen a record 34 times for @entity79 in the 1994 - 5 season ' seven in four is maybe too much			1
it is something that is not normal			0
we can not expect that after eight matches he will have 14 goals			0
' but @entity129 added : ‘ he is comfortable in the team			0
the team was built in a way that we were waiting for a certain type of striker and i think now everybody knows that @entity19 did the right thing in waiting for him and not going into the market in the summer of 2013 or january			2
‘ we waited for the right one			0
’ @entity18 has already staked his claim on a number of top - flight records but the striker remains in contention to break the biggest one of them all , which @entity0 has kept safe for 86 years and counting			1
@entity170 - @entity18 10/1 - @entity65 14/1 - @entity68 20/1 - @entity171 25/1 - @entity172 33/1 - @entity173 33/1 - @entity174 33/1 - @entity175 40/1 - @entity176 40/1 - @entity177 click here to place a bet ... full name : @entity0 born : february 21 , 1906 in @entity181 , @entity182 died : march 1 , 1980 at @entity102 ( from heart attack during @entity185 derby ) clubs and appearances / goals : @entity189 - 30/27 @entity1 - 399/349 @entity190 - 9/3 @entity191 - 7/10 @entity192 - 2/1 international : @entity89 - 16/18			1

@entity18 has already scored seven goals for @entity19 in four games
@entity31 striker is odds - on to win @entity61
@entity18 would score 66 goals this season if he keeps up current rate
@entity0 holds record with 60 goals in one season for @entity1
@entity71 and @entity76 hold @entity58 season goals record
