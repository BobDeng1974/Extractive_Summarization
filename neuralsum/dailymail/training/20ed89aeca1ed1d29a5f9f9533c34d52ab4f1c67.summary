fearless villagers in @entity1 have been filmed wrestling with deadly @entity3 in a bid to catch as many as possible after 15,000 escaped from a farm			1
the reptiles , which can grow to 16ft long , were accidentally freed after heavy rain made the nearby @entity9 river flood last weekend			1
bosses at the @entity11 in the north - east of the country opened the gates to the animals ’ pens to release the rising waters – inadvertently letting their entire stock out			1
as the flood waters fell , many have been found trapped in the branches of trees			1
the @entity44 crocodile is the largest crocodile in @entity1 and the second - largest in the world after the saltwater crocodile			1
prey consists of gazelles , antelope , waterbuck , sitatunga , lechwe , wildebeest , zebras , warthogs , giraffes and @entity57 buffalos			0
they are also known to eat domestic animals such chickens , goats , sheep and cattle and are known to attack humans			0
males typically measure between 3.5 and 5 metres but very old , mature ones can grow to 5.5 m or more			0
they are found in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity1 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , and @entity82			0
isolated populations also exist in @entity84 and in @entity85			0
but as this incredible footage shows , many residents showed no fear in tackling the crocodiles themselves			1
at least 2,000 had been caught by friday according to @entity1 's @entity94 language @entity92 newspaper			1
police have been leading the hunt which has mainly taken place at night because their eyes reflect in the torchlight and they are easier to find			0
the video shows locals pinning the crocodiles to the ground and then handcuffing them with plastic ties			1
earlier this week , the crocodile farm 's boss @entity105 told the @entity92 that he has been recapturing the animals whenever he is alerted to one			2
he said he had already caught ' a few thousand ' in the dense bush and orange groves next to his farm , but he told the newspaper that ' more than half ' of his reptiles are still missing			1
commercial crocodile farms breed the animals for their skin , which is used to make crocodile leather for items such as belts , shoes and handbags			2
there is also a small market for crocodile meat , but most often the dead reptile 's is fed to other crocs as the species is cannibalistic			2
the commercial crocodile farming industry is small , but growing , in @entity1 , where there are around 60 farms containing a total of around 500,000 animals			2
because the quality of the skin is paramount , some farms keep each crocodile in its own , battery - style pen so that its hide is not scratched or otherwise damaged by other animals			2
however this has lead to allegations of animal cruelty and most farms keep the animals in communal pens			0
@entity3 are meat eating and can grow to up to five metres long			0
they can run at up to eight miles an hour and swim at up to 22 mph			0
they are extremely dangerous to humans			0
their preferred method of killing is to grab an animal in their enormous jaws then drag it , alive , underwater to drown it			0
blunder : the crocodiles were accidentally released after farmers tried to release excess flood water from their pens an estimated 15,000 crocodiles have escaped from the @entity162 in @entity1 where they are bred for their skin which is used in handbags , belts and shoes watch video of @entity1 @entity170 capturing crocodiles here :			1
