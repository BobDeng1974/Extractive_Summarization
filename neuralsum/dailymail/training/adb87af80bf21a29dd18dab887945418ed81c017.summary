the burning alive of a @entity1 man by the self - proclaimed @entity2 has jolted the president of the @entity5 into acknowledging publicly that the world 's chief terror threat comes from people who ' profess to stand up for @entity1 but instead betray it			1
' but that stark conclusion , long missing in the @entity11 , was followed by a litany of other wrongs done in the name of religion			0
' lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place , ' @entity16 told the @entity21 on thursday morning , ' remember that during the @entity23 and the @entity24 , people committed terrible deeds in the name of @entity27			1
' ' in our home country , slavery and @entity30 all too often was justified in the name of @entity27			0
' but ' no @entity32 condones terror , ' he insisted			0
' faith , he said , is often ' twisted and distorted , used as a wedge , or worse , sometimes used as a weapon			0
' then he got specific			0
' from a school in @entity63 to the streets of @entity65 , we have seen violence and terror perpetrated by people who profess to stand up for faith – their faith – ( who ) profess to stand up for @entity1 but in fact are betraying it , ' @entity16 said			1
' you see @entity2 , ' he continued , referring to @entity3 by his preferred alternate acronym , ' a brutal , vicious death cult that in the name of religion carried out unspeakable acts of barbarism , terrorizing religious minorities like the @entity81 , subjecting women to rape as a weapon of war , and claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions			1
' @entity89 as bad ? @entity16 compared the @entity3 terror army to the 15th @entity24 , carried out by @entity91 against @entity92 and other religious groups slavery : @entity16 said @entity5 's early human bondage was often justified in the name of @entity27 @entity16 also condemned @entity98 's @entity97 sectarian conflicts , @entity100 's runaway tide of murders hitting both @entity102 and @entity103 , a religious war in the @entity105 and ' antisemitism and hate crimes ' in @entity108 as evidence that bad actors ' seek to hijack religions for their own murderous ends			1
' his clear linkage of @entity3 with @entity1 stands in sharp contrast to his january 16 joint press conference with @entity117 prime minister @entity116			2
while @entity116 came out swinging against ' a very serious @entity43 extremist terrorist threat in @entity108 , in @entity5 , ( and ) across the world , ' @entity16 declined to frame @entity3 as a radical @entity1 sect , calling them ' terrorists ' and ' fanatics ' instead			1
keeping with his administration 's policy to label foreign fighters as ' terrorists , ' @entity16 would not refer to the religion of @entity3 militants during the @entity11 news conference but at one point called them ' fanatics			1
' the @entity11 has scheduled a ' combating violent extremism ' summit for later in february , and @entity16 's spokesman @entity136 has taken great pains to avoid giving the impression that it might be particularly critical of a narrow group of @entity102			2
but the gruesome videotaped murder of @entity143 @entity142 pilot @entity141 may have shaken the @entity11 into a more aggressive posture since its online release on tuesday			0
@entity3 militants are seen in the footage burning the 26 - year - old man alive as he struggles in a giant animal cage , and then burying his charred body , twisted cage and all , under a cascade of broken concrete			2
@entity143 intelligence officials believe the grisly execution was carried out as early as january 3 , meaning @entity155 was dead long before the @entity16 - @entity116 press conference			2
what a difference three weeks can make : @entity16 shied away from hitting @entity3 as a @entity1 group during a press conference with @entity117 prime minister @entity116 on january 16 , while @entity116 leapt at the chance to castigate the group in religious terms ' death cult ' : @entity16 slammed @entity3 by name two days after the group released a video showing a @entity143 pilot who had run a bombing mission against them being burned alive @entity143 's @entity172 was scheduled to read a passage of @entity175 scripture at the prayer breakfast but did not appear : he was back in his home country dealing with the fallout from @entity141 's death and the wrath of a country bent on revenge			1
@entity172 ordered the execution of two @entity185 prisoners in retaliation			0
the prayer breakfast , an annual event that @entity16 has attended every year since becoming president , attracted 3,600 people from all 50 states and 130 countries			1
its most conspicuous guest on thursday was the @entity44 , a revered @entity195 monk embroiled in a long political dispute with @entity197 over @entity199 's independence			0
he has never before attended a public event with an @entity5 president , as @entity5 administrations have been cautious about antagonizing @entity203			1
but @entity16 said thursday that he had welcomed him to the @entity11 on several occasions and considered the @entity44 ' a good friend			2
' the holy man was seated at the front-most round table in a cavernous ballroom along with presidential adviser @entity210 and other dignitaries , directly in front of the speakers ' podium			0
he is ' a powerful example of what it means to practice and act , ' @entity16 said			0
' he inspires speak up for freedom and dignity of all human beings			0

president appeared at annual prayer event attended by 3,600 people from all 50 states and 130 countries
first head - on presidential attack on @entity3 in terms of religion in recent memory
@entity16 has been criticized for failing to condemn @entity234 terrorists as religious radicals while other world *leaders* decry ' radical @entity1 '
he followed up aggressive language by comparing @entity3 to the *medieval* @entity23 , the @entity24 and @entity5 slavery
