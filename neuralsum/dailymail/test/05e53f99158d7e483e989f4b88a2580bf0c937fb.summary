scientists have revealed a sophisticated new dating technique shows that @entity2 , an important fossil of an early human forerunner unearthed in the 1990s in @entity5 , is roughly 3.7 million years old			1
' the age of @entity2 has been highly debated , ' said geologist @entity7 of @entity8 in @entity9 , whose research appears in the journal @entity12			1
the study found @entity2 , a member of the species @entity15 , lived at roughly the same time as @entity16 , the species whose most famous fossil , known as @entity20 , comes from @entity21			1
the species was much bigger and taller than @entity20 's , with gorilla - like facial features but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for climbing			1
like @entity20 , @entity2 was female			1
its hands were proportioned like ours , with a long thumb and relatively short fingers and palm , unlike the elongated hands of modern apes			2
its legs were slightly longer than its arms , unlike modern apes			2
both species blended ape - like and human - like traits but with different features			2
the researchers analyzed 11 rock samples from around the nearly complete @entity2 fossil skeleton from the @entity31 to gauge its age			1
the findings may have important implications about the evolutionary relationships among humankind 's ancient relatives			2
our species , @entity56 , appeared roughly 200,000 years ago			1
earlier members of the human genus , @entity61 , date back more than 2 million years			1
our genus was predated by other species on the human family tree including various representatives of the genus @entity68			2
members of @entity20 's species were contemporaries of @entity2 , although @entity20 herself lived about 500,000 years later			1
like @entity20 , @entity2 was female			1
the species was much bigger and taller than @entity20 's , with gorilla - like facial features but fully upright and very strong with powerful hands for climbing , according to paleoanthropologists @entity76 and @entity78 of the @entity79 in @entity80			1
the face of @entity2 , which has now been accurately dated for the first time			1
its hands were proportioned like ours , with a long thumb and relatively short fingers and palm , unlike the elongated hands of modern apes			2
its legs were slightly longer than its arms , unlike modern apes			2
@entity76 and @entity78 noted similarities in facial structure and some teeth between @entity2 and the later human relative @entity96 , indicating @entity2 's species may have been ancestral to @entity96 or a close cousin			1
the new date for @entity2 indicates @entity20 's species was not the only one that could have given rise to later members of the human family tree , @entity76 and @entity78 said			1
' the fact , therefore , that we have at least two ( @entity68 ) species living at the same time in different parts of @entity5 , ( about ) 3.67 million years ago , raises the question of how many other species there may have been which have not yet been discovered , ' @entity76 and @entity78 said by email			1
the team used @entity8 's @entity115 's powerful accelerator mass spectrometer and a new detector , called a gas - filled magnet detector , to measure the radioisotopes			2
' we succeeded in our measurement , but we were surprised the dates were so old , ' said @entity7 , a professor of earth , atmospheric and planetary sciences at @entity8			2

' we succeeded in our measurement , but we were surprised the dates were so old , ' @entity7 said			0
' we double - and triple - checked our results , running the measurement again and again			0
' the gas - filled magnet creates a different charge on the two radioisotopes and throws the magnesium - 26 on a different path with a curvature that misses the detector			0
this lowers the magnesium ratio and increases the aluminum - 26 count in the sample that makes it to the detector , which results in a much smaller margin of error in the measurement			0
some of the other material found at the site : stone tools found at a different level of the @entity31 cave also were dated at 2.18 million years old , making them among the oldest known stone tools in @entity5			1
the gas - filled magnet detector was originally to be used to analyze samples of solar wind collected by the @entity157 spacecraft			0
unfortunately , the space capsule carrying the samples crashed in 2004 on its return to @entity161			0
the crash delayed analysis of the @entity157 samples , but @entity165 continued to build the detector and it was completed the summer of 2014			0
@entity165 has since used it to perform analysis for other projects , including those from the @entity31 site			0
' only a few detectors of this kind exist in the world , ' @entity165 said			0

@entity76 , a professor in the @entity194 at @entity79 in @entity5 holds the @entity2 skull , among the oldest hominid skeletons ever dated at 3.67 million years old , according to an advanced dating method			1
the date places @entity2 as an older relative of @entity20 , a famous @entity68 skeleton dated at 3.2 million years old that was found in @entity21			1

the new findings suggest @entity2 roamed the @entity161 at around the same time as the famed 3.2 - million - year - old @entity20 , an @entity16 - shown in a reconstruction above			1
when discovered in @entity215 , @entity21 , @entity20 was the only skeleton of the species known ; she would 've stood 3.5 feet ( about a meter ) tall			1
currently , more than 300 individuals of this species , which lived between about 3.85 million and 2.95 million years ago , have been uncovered @entity165 has since used it to perform analysis for other projects , including those from the @entity31 site			1
' only a few detectors of this kind exist in the world , ' @entity165 said			0
' one of the reasons i came to @entity8 was to be a part of the revolutionary science that can be done when such resources are applied to challenging problems			0
these results highlight what can be accomplished through a collaboration that spans multiple disciplines			0
it could n't have happened without the unique skills and resources each person brought to the table			0
' @entity247 's @entity246 researcher @entity245 shows @entity2 , a fossil with both ape - like and human features found in a cave at the @entity31 site , near @entity80			1
the ' @entity252 ' is one of eight @entity254 in @entity5			2
in 2008 the 47,000 hectare site site yielded the discovery of @entity257 - thought to be an early human ancestor that combines simian and modern human characteristics			0
the world - renowned @entity31 is home to the oldest and most continuous paleaontological dig in the world			0
it is also the site of discovery of the famous pre-human skull affectionately known as ' @entity269 ' , and the almost complete hominid skeleton called ' @entity2 '			1
@entity7 's original attempt was the first time aluminum - 26 and beryllium - 10 radioisotopic dating had been used to determine the age of a fossil			1
he developed the method in 1997 and first used it to study changes in mountains , rivers and other geological formations			0
because of their very slow rate of decay , these particular radioisotopes allow dating to reach back millions of years , much further in history than the more commonly known carbon - 14 dating that can only stretch back about 50,000 years , he said			2
only a small amount of the radioisotopes remain in the quartz after millions of years , and it can only be measured by the ultrasensitive analysis of accelerator mass spectrometry			2
' we had given up and nearly walked away from the project thinking we had failed , ' @entity7 said			0
' then the new detector was completed , and we thought we would give it one last try			0

@entity2 was unearthed in the 1990s in @entity5
new dating of fossil shows it is is roughly 3.7 million years old
lived at roughly the same time as @entity16 , the species whose most famous fossil , known as @entity20 , comes from @entity21
raises the question of how many other species there may have been
