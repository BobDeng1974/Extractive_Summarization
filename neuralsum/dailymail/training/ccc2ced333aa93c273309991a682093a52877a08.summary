@entity2 airline passengers will be affected by tightened airport anti-terror checks on electronic gadgets , the government has confirmed			1

although the extra measures will not be in place at @entity2 airports , passengers travelling through affected terminals will have their devices tested , creating possible delays			1
@entity36 code - shares with @entity38 - based @entity37 , meaning flights from @entity2 could be affected			1
' the extra measures have been implemented due to concerns around a heightened terrorist threat to aviation for direct flights to the @entity11 and @entity10 and mean that travellers departing these locations on @entity11 and @entity10 - bound flights may experience additional security screening either at the main security checkpoint or at their boarding gate , ' a spokesman for @entity41 and deputy prime minister @entity42 said			1
' these measures may apply to passengers departing and transiting through affected airports , including @entity2 carriers – @entity36 and @entity57 and their code - share airlines			1
' at this stage , the @entity2 government is not requiring additional security measures for any international inbound or outbound flights to @entity2 and the @entity63 remains unchanged at @entity64			2
' under the measures , travellers will have to prove their electronic devices – some with a notoriously short battery life – are working normally , following fears that terrorists could pack the battery compartments with explosives			2
the development , which comes at the start of the @entity76 summer holiday season , is based on @entity11 intelligence amid fears of an attack by @entity81 extremists			2
security officials are concerned that a booby - trapped electronic device could be smuggled onto a plane and used as a bomb by @entity87 - based @entity86 or the @entity88 , @entity86 ’s affiliate in @entity89			0
in 2009 , @entity87 - linked explosives expert @entity90 was behind a similar plot and built an ‘ underwear bomb ’ , used in a failed attempt to bring down a plane from @entity95 bound for @entity96			0
tests on mobile phones , laptops and tablets will now be expanded to cover destinations around the world passengers were first warned last week of extra checks on phones , and on monday @entity106 said it would ban travellers from boarding @entity11 - bound flights if their electronic devices were not charged			1
it performed a partial u-turn yesterday , announcing that anyone whose devices had a flat battery could still fly – but they would have to leave their gadgets behind , and pay for them to be sent to their home address			0
official advice to travellers from the @entity10 's @entity121 had previously been limited to those ‘ flying to the @entity11 ’			2
it now affects those ‘ flying to and from the @entity10 ’ , and states : ‘ make sure your electronic devices are charged before you travel			1
if your device does n’t switch on , you wo n’t be allowed to bring it on to the aircraft			0
’ gadgets packed in checked luggage will continue to be scanned as normal			0
passengers whose devices are deemed to be suspicious could be prevented from leaving them in the hold – and could be barred from getting on flights altogether			2
@entity10 transport secretary @entity135 said yesterday that ‘ passengers may notice additional security measures on some routes both to and from the @entity10 ’			2
a @entity121 spokesman added : ‘ in line with the @entity11 advice , passengers on some routes into and out of the @entity10 may now also be required to show that electronic devices in their hand luggage are powered up or face not being allowed to bring the device onto the aircraft			1
’ mr @entity135 told the @entity148 that the new advice ‘ is in line with that issued by the @entity11 , and we have updated our official advice to passengers accordingly ’			2
checks will affect hundreds more flights to and from the @entity29 and volatile parts of @entity31 and @entity32 his written statement continued : ‘ for obvious reasons we will not be commenting in detail on the measures or the routes affected			1
' we will work with the aviation industry to minimise disruption as far as possible			0
’ mr @entity135 stressed there was no change to the terror threat level , which remains at ‘ substantial ’ , but warned : ‘ we face a constantly evolving threat from terrorism and must respond accordingly			0
’ the escalation in security checks came hours after @entity106 ditched its own ‘ no charge , no fly ’ rule , announcing that passengers whose devices had a flat battery could still board planes – but without their gadgets			0
the airline will now see checks extended far beyond the 35 daily flights from the @entity10 to the @entity11 which were first affected			1
a @entity106 spokesman said : ‘ we would advise that all customers flying on routes into and out of the @entity10 , as well on flights from the @entity10 to @entity11 cities , ensure that their electronic devices are powered up , as there may be extra searches and checks before boarding			1
' our flights continue to operate as normal			0
’ they added : ‘ safety and security is our top priority at all times and we continue to work closely with airports and governments around the world			0
’ @entity106 also announced measures – similar to those of rivals @entity204 – to allow customers to have their devices returned at a later date			0
as in @entity57 ’s case , the cost of a courier will be covered by the passenger			0
@entity106 said it was ‘ liaising with @entity10 airports with a view to finding a workable solution ’ .			0
