by @entity0 published : 05:49 est , 13 november 2012 updated : 12:45 est , 13 november 2012 most parents would be delighted to see their toddler grow up with a permanent smile on his face			1
but for @entity7 and @entity8 , their son @entity6 's ever - cheery demeanour is a painful reminder of the struggle that growing up will be for him			1
the two - year - old , from @entity13 , @entity14 , was born with @entity15 - a chromosome disorder which causes severe learning difficulties			1
and the rare neurological condition has a side effect that means suffers tend to be easily excited and are left almost permanently laughing or smiling			2
@entity6 ’s mother , @entity7 , said : ' when we feel down , @entity6 ’s laughter keeps us all going			1
you just have to look at him and his happiness takes over			2
' at the end of the day when you have children you just want them to be happy , and @entity6 always is			2
' she added : ' the only problem is if @entity6 and his big brother , @entity35 , are playing and @entity35 accidentally gets hurt			2
@entity35 will be crying , but @entity6 just laughs and he does n’t understand why			2
that can hurt as we do n’t want @entity35 to think @entity6 is happy about hurting him			0
' @entity6 was born with @entity15 - a chromosome disorder that causes severe learning difficulties			1
pictured with his mother @entity7 , father @entity40 and his five - year - old brother @entity35 @entity6 's parents see his constant smiling as a happy side effect of an otherwise difficult condition			1
pictured with brother @entity35 mrs @entity46 , 41 , and her husband @entity40 , 34 , only discovered @entity6 ’s condition when he was having trouble feeding as a baby			0
she said : ' i did n’t think @entity6 had a major issue , he just seemed to have feeding issues - even the doctors and midwives did n’t seem too concerned to begin with			2
' on his six week health check the doctor felt he looked scrawny , and referred him to @entity58 , where he was seen by a consultant paediatrican who admitted him immediately			0
' during his time in hospital he had countless blood tests , mri scans and x-rays			0
his paediatrician luckily had seen @entity15 once before and had his blood tested for it			0
' it was only when we were told that he needed to have these genetic tests that i became wary			0
' it was a total shock when the tests came back positive and we were told that he had @entity73 - i ’d never heard of it before			1
@entity6 's condition means he will never talk , and may struggle to walk medics encouraged @entity7 and @entity40 to research the condition online			1
mrs @entity46 said : ' we were driving home in the car and my husband was looking up @entity73 syndrome on his phone			1
' he started reading all these things off the computer and in the end i was sobbing so much i had to pull over the car			0
' it was so hard to begin with because we knew so little about it			0
it was only thanks to charities and support groups that we were able to cope			0
' @entity6 's parents say they see him smiling as a happy side effect of an otherwise difficult condition			0
mrs @entity46 said : ' we always just thought he was a really happy baby , we never even considered it would be a symptom of something more serious			0
' i do n’t understand why @entity6 always laughs and smiles , but he always has a lovely big smile on his face			1
' sometimes i do n’t even think it ’s a result of the @entity73 syndrome - he does n’t have a care in the world , so why would n’t he be happy ? ' the toddler also seems to only need a few hours of sleep a night @entity6 ’s @entity15 - a condition he also shares with actor @entity112 ’s son - also affects his development			1
@entity7 said : ' @entity6 will never be able to speak , but we ’ve done a signing course in the hope that we ’ll still be able to communicate with him			1
' it must be frustrating for him because he can understand what we say , but he ca n’t respond			0
' a lot of children with @entity73 syndrome communicate using @entity122 so we ’re saving up for one			1
' he may never be able to walk either - if he does , he ’ll probably be quite unbalanced			1
' a further symptom of the condition is that two - year - old @entity6 appears to need only a few hours of sleep a night			1
his mother added : ' he goes to sleep very easily but he wakes up in the night and just lies there			2
' we would guess at the moment he has about four hours sleep a night			0
' he ’s perfectly happy in bed at the moment because he does n’t need much to keep him entertained , but as he gets older he ’ll need some more stimulation			0
' we ’ll also need to make sure that his bedroom is safe when he ’s unsupervised , so a soft floor and a low bed will be really important			0
' @entity6 ’s family have found comfort in the charity assert , a support group to help families of those with the condition			0
they also have a fundraising society for @entity6 called one @entity145 : @entity146 @entity15 is a rare genetic condition first identified in 1965 by a @entity25 doctor , @entity73			1
dr @entity73 had noticed similarities between a small number of previously undiagnosed children that seemed to indicate they had a common problem			2
after seeing a painting in the @entity157 museum in @entity158 , @entity154 entitled a boy with a puppet he was inspired to write a medical paper titled @entity162			2
the syndrome - originally called ' @entity15 ' because of the characteristic happy demeanour and stiff jerky movements of the children - was renamed @entity15 in 1982			1
although at first little was known and indeed few other cases identified , in recent years much more has been learned			0
during the 1980 's advances in genetic medicine made it possible to diagnose increasing numbers of cases and also to start identifying the cause			0
in simple terms , it is a chromosome disorder that causes severe learning difficulties			1
@entity15 is not a disease , it is a neurological disorder that causes severe learning difficulties , and although those affected have a normal life expectancy , they will require looking after throughout their lives			2
most as children are diagnosed between the ages of three and seven when the characteristic physical and behavioural features become @entity189 more information visit : @entity190			0
