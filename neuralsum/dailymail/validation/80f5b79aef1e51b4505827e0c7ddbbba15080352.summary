it 's been three weeks since @entity1 was heard threatening to stab his ex-girlfriend - and the mother of his one - year - old son @entity4 in an audio recording			1
but a second audio , handed over by @entity7 , 23 , this week and released by @entity8 on sunday , hears the 23 - year - old @entity10 star make another expletive - laden rant , threatening to end her life			1
@entity1 , who was arrested but released by @entity13 without charge after the last incident , also refers to his second child @entity16 , born last month with @entity17 , as a ' mistake			1
now though , an audio - taped recording - heard by @entity29 and allegedly secretly taken by @entity7 last november at her home in front of their young son - sees @entity1 refer to her as his ' property ' and threaten her if she moves on with another man			1
he is heard saying : ' i swear on this boy ’s life i will end your f * * * * * * life if you shag another man			2
never in your f * * * * * * life are you going to be with another man			0
i can swear on my son ’s life			0
' split : @entity1 and ex-girlfriend @entity50 split in @entity51 and have a one - year - old son together @entity23 ' shut your f * * * * * * mouth you f * * * * * * c * * *			1

' @entity1 made similar threats of physical violence in the first tape released earlier this month but in this latest release @entity7 can be heard exclaiming , ' ow , get off me ! ' and tells @entity1 to stop ' hitting ' her until she seems distressed and in tears			1
there is no proof that @entity1 actually hits @entity7 in the recording			2
after asking him to leave her house , he admits , ' yes i am horrible when you go on about other men ' telling her that as long as they have a son together , @entity7 is his ' property ' bouncing back : following the release of the first audio recording , in which @entity1 was heard denying he was dating current girlfriend and the mother of his second child @entity17 , @entity1 is now back in his relationship and expected back on @entity10 throwback : @entity7 and @entity1 are now the parents of @entity23 , who is one year old @entity1 can be heard telling @entity7 that she ca n't get a new boyfriend even though he 's made another girl pregnant because that was a ' mistake ' and he did n't ' mean ' to get 22 - year - old @entity17 pregnant			1
@entity7 tells him that it 's laughable because having a child does n't get more permanent but he says things would be different if he ' actually wanted a family with [ @entity17 ] ' or if he was going to ' propose ' to her			2
' i do n't care			0
it wo n't be funny when you 're in hospital , ' he says , and referring to a future boyfriend he adds : ' if i 'm going to go to prison , i 'll stab him in the throat			0

he said : ' it has taken me a while to find the right words but i would like to say that i am truly sorry to anyone who was offended by what they heard			0
' ' i am ashamed and embarrassed that i allowed myself to reach such a dark place that i behaved in a way that even i did n't recognise			0
