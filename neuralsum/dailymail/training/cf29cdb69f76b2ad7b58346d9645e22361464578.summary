@entity1 is finally over , the style gods have spoken — and very little of it made much sense			2
directives for next season include ruffles , tulle ( that ’s netting to you and me ) , cropped jackets , lots of lace , flares , anoraks , animal prints and so - called ‘ sports luxe ’ ( over-priced plimsolls )			1
that is nothing , however , compared with the one trend that fills me with genuine horror			2
there is one trend that fills @entity25 with terror , colour , as seen during @entity1			1
she feels black is far more flattering on her figure			1
@entity30 was the big hit of the week , as seen at the @entity33 show last monday , and not just any old colour			1
like @entity36 , they came in pinks , purples , oranges , greens , yellows and exotic blues , a @entity44 mish - mash of clashing brights			1
for once , all those oversized sunglasses so beloved of fashionistas must genuinely have come in handy			2
@entity48 , queen of @entity49 , has only one hard and fast fashion rule : never wear top - to - toe black			1
which , of course , is one of the reasons i do			2
winter , spring , summer and fall : black , black , black			1
not just to annoy , but also because it suits me			2
remember that fad a few years back for ‘ colour analysis ’ ? none of us were wearing the shades that suited us , the experts said			1
get it right and you can look younger , prettier , thinner			2
like a fool , i did it			2
a nice lady came to my house , professed herself horrified at the tenebrous state of my wardrobe , then spent the morning draping me in various brightly coloured swatches			2
she concluded that black was , in fact , the colour that suited me most			1
the only useful piece of advice was that i should never wear brown			1
so , my idea of colour is the occasional sequin or , perhaps , a little print			1
when it gets really hot , i might concede to a splash of khaki , or a white linen shirt			2
i own a few colourful scarves , and one or two striking handbags			2
but my default sartorial setting is black			1
@entity48 , queen of @entity49 , has only one hard and fast fashion rule : never wear top - to - toe black which is going to make next spring and summer slightly awkward			1
because , by then , the garish pinks and purples we saw ( together ! ) on catwalks of the likes of @entity33 and @entity101 favourite @entity100 last week will have filtered down to our shops , and there ’ll be nothing that is n’t migraine - inducing on the racks			1
so , do i stock up on my favourite black now , while it ’s still in shops , or do i — and i can feel my chest tightening as i consider this — bite the bullet and see if next season ’s biggest trend suits me ? ‘ of course , you can wear colour , @entity25 , ’ one fashionista friend told me , snootily			1
the more it clashes , the better			2
in six months ’ time , no one will turn a hair anyway , everyone will be doing it			2
’ emboldened , i took myself off to the @entity123 and ventured to sections i barely knew existed			0
what to choose ? thankfully , stores such as @entity128 and @entity126 already have so much colour it could blind you — heaven knows what it ’ll be like next year — so i grab armfuls of brights and head home			1
and that ’s when i discover the truth			0
ladies , do n’t be fooled			0
not everyone can wear colour			1
if you need any proof , just look at the photo of me above			0
i look like a cross between a children ’s entertainer and an explosion in a paint factory			0
it ’s no way for a respected member of the community to appear in public , is it now ? the green shirt squashes my boobs , makes my arms look like sausages and clings to every bit of my muffin top			1
and does it go with the electric blue - and - pink skirt with its horrid little frill ( two trends in one , right there ) ? does it heck ! @entity128 should be ashamed for making these clothes			1
however , by contrast , their coat is a triumph			0
at least its only sin it its orangeness			0
and the shoes are a revelation			0
from @entity126 , they ’re extremely comfortable for a pair of spiky heels			0
the @entity177 and @entity178 bag is a laugh , too , though they do say yellow is the colour of madness , which , in the context of this outfit , is most apposite			1
on a much smaller , much younger woman , it could just work			0
@entity189 in her pomp would have , as the saying goes , ‘ rocked ’ it			0
as would a small child			0
but put it on mrs average , and it eloquently illustrates the abyss that exists between the catwalk and real world			0
in the latter , women dress for confidence and convenience			0
@entity204 , it is well documented , has a minimising effect			0
and if , like me , you ’ve never been entirely happy with your size and shape , it simplifies and shrinks the silhouette , muting rather than amplifying it , which is just the way i like it			0
( granted , a big bum is still a big bum , whichever way you package it up			1
but black allows me to disappear a little , which , when you ’re the size of a small horse , is no bad thing			1
) in the real world , we women do n’t let our appearance dominate our existence			0
we choose clothes that require minimum fuss and effort , but flatter us			0
the garish pinks and purples seen on catwalks of the likes of @entity33 and @entity101 favourite @entity100 last week will have filtered down to our shops so , a wardrobe full of black is a god - send because , when we ’re trying to get dressed of a morning , the children are squabbling and our husband ca n’t find his car keys , we know we can throw on any old combination and look ok			1
that , as we all know , is the kind of thinking the world of fashion can not abide			1
it absolutely relies on women to feel dissatisfied with their appearance , to crave something new and exciting			0
if we all just declared ourselves happy with the way we look , they ’d be out of business			0
hence their determination to show me , and the countless other women who go through life very happily dressed as @entity261 widows , the error of our ways			1
but , this time , it ’s they who are wrong			0
any lingering suspicion this refusal to toe the fashion line might be my fault was blown away the moment my daughter walked through the door and snorted with laughter			1
my son looked slightly panicked			0
my husband looked up and said , ‘ ooh , orange			0
‘ do you think that ’s wise ? ’ ‘ @entity281 ’ , was the obvious answer but , without time to change , i wore the whole damn thing to dinner with friends			0
amazing , ’ said my hostess , as she opened her front door			0
there followed one of the most uncomfortable evenings of my life			0
far from feeling fabulous and fashion - forward , i felt horribly self - conscious			1
deprived of my normal camouflage , i could n’t get comfortable , either			0
i felt everyone was staring at me — and not in a good way			0
i could n’t wait to kick off that skirt and change into my ( dark - grey ) pyjamas			2
will i ever wear top - to - toe colour again ? maybe if i lost a couple of stones and dropped a few years			1
but , for now , i fear , it ’s back to black for me .			2
