an ' unprecedented ' clean - up operation has been launched in @entity1 after it became swamped by debris from last year 's devastating @entity4 tsunami			1
workers plan to spend 12 days clearing the beach on @entity7 , which is covered in items including balls , buoys , beer crates , styrofoam and lunch boxes			1
and they can expect to repeat this process in the future because an estimated 1.5million tons of flotsam and jetsam is yet complete the 3,500 - mile journey to @entity1 and elsewhere in @entity20			1
cluttered : tsunami debris washed up on @entity7 , @entity1 ahead of a 12 - day clean - up mission dumped : a fuel canister and a beer crate among the debris on @entity7 , @entity1 @entity7 , which is the largest uninhabited @entity27 island and lies 120 miles southeast of state capital @entity28 , is likely to receive another equally large quantity by the time the year has ended			1
' the debris found on initial surveys of the island showed an absolutely unprecedented amount of buoys , @entity12 and other high floating debris , @entity37 of the @entity38 told @entity39			1
so far the wreckage floating away from @entity41 has included only the odd item - including the bizarre find of a @entity44 and a football that was later reunited with its owner back in @entity4			0
but much bigger quantities are set to arrive thick and fast in the coming months as scientists are now saying the debris will cross the @entity50 far sooner than previously thought			1
mess : a barrel and @entity12 among the flotsam and jetsam on the island 120 miles from @entity28 washed up : a sign , left , and a buoy and fuel can found by the @entity58 of @entity59 found : a gas bottle that washed up along with other tsunami debris on @entity7 , @entity1 from the air : a view of the island taken from a helicopter the latest computer models estimate that a vast collection of debris - measuring 4,000 miles across at its longest - will start washing up this october and continue to do so into late 2013			1
a recent satellite image from @entity72 's @entity71 observatory shows the marauding mass sprawled across the ocean 's surface			0
around 4.8million tonnes - including parts of houses , factories , cars and ships - were pulled into the ocean when the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck @entity4 in march last year			0
while heavy items sank , at least 1.5million tonnes of lighter material such as buoys , oil drums and furniture were carried off by tides and the wind on a 4,500 - mile journey to @entity20			1
projections made earlier this year by the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) , in @entity94 , @entity95 , suggested most of the detritus would begin arriving between march 2013 and march 2014			0
on fast tides : the latest computer models predict that thousands of tonnes of debris , shown here in a graphic interpretation of a @entity72 satellite image , from the @entity4 tsunami will hit @entity20 shores far sooner than expected devastation : the earthquake and subsequent tsunami that struck @entity4 in march last year washed nearly five million tonnes of debris , including boats , cars and part of houses and factories into the @entity50 bizarre find : this @entity44 was found on a remote beach on the west coast of @entity116 last week after being swept away by the tsunami last year stunned : the owner of the @entity44 , @entity118 ( left ) , said the discovery by @entity120 ( right ) was a miracle debris : radioactive tuna is not the only casualty of the tsunami to wash up in @entity20 , as this motorbike which found its way from @entity4 to @entity128 proves journey : the container holding the items travelled 5,000km from @entity132 in @entity4 where the @entity133 struck all the way to the coasts of @entity116 but predictions from the @entity4 government and the @entity138 ( @entity138 ) has now pushed that date forward to october this year , according to a report in @entity141			1
indeed , many lighter objects began reaching land as early as last november			0
last month , a @entity4 teenager who lost his home in last year 's devastating tsunami spoke of his delight after his football washed up on a remote @entity1 beach 3,500 miles from @entity4			1
@entity150 , 16 , came forward to reveal that he was the owner of the ball discovered by @entity20 radar technician @entity152 on @entity154			0
mr @entity152 , who also found a volleyball while out beachcombing , now plans to travel with his wife @entity157 to return the ball			0
can i have my ball back , please ? ! @entity4 teenager @entity150 ( left ) told of his delight after his football was found by @entity152 ( right ) on an @entity1 beach			2
mr @entity152 's wife ( pictured ) also found a volleyball drift : the sports balls were found on @entity154 , about 70 miles from mainland @entity1 and yesterday , the @entity4 owner of a @entity44 motorcycle said its discovery on a remote beach on the @entity171 of @entity116 last week was a miracle			2
the owner , @entity118 , a 29 - year - old resident of the town of @entity176 , in @entity132 , was tracked down by a @entity44 representative in @entity4 who saw the story , first reported by @entity179 , the broadcaster reported today			0
@entity120 , was combing the beach on @entity182 islands when he made the discovery			2
a clearer picture of the debris is not expected to emerge before june or july when two privately - funded expeditions are due to travel into the @entity50			2
poignant : items from the disaster have also been recovered in @entity1 , like this sandal debris : toothbrushes are among thousands of items making their way to shore after crossing the @entity50 @entity196 officials , which last week released posters advising residents what may arrive on their beaches , say it is highly unlikely any human remains will be found			1
@entity196 , @entity204 , @entity116 and @entity1 will get much of it , while most of @entity206 will be protected by currents pushing objects back out to sea , according to @entity141			0
@entity95 , however , is in line for several deposits			0
the @entity27 navy and coastguard will be monitoring the debris over fears it could pose a danger to shipping			2
but for anyone worried that they may wake one day to a tsunami of trash heading towards them , @entity223 , of the @entity93 , has these words of reassurances			0
' most people probably think there is a huge pile of debris moving across the ocean like a carpet			2
but it is very sparse , very patchy			0

workers to spend 12 days removing debris up beach on @entity7 island
among flotsam and jetsam are buoys , beer crates and @entity12 items
