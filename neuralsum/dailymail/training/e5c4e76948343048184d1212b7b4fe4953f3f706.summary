by @entity0 @entity1 will be allowed to join @entity2 this summer - but only if @entity4 land £ 31.5million target @entity5 from @entity7			1
@entity8 will look to revamp his forward line ahead of next season , with @entity7 hotshot @entity5 top of his list			0
the @entity13 is happy for @entity1 , who is currently on loan at @entity15 , to leave this summer - but he wants to capture at least two new strikers before sanctioning a permanent move for the @entity18			1
instead , he 's been setting the @entity31 alight while on loan at @entity34 and , this season , @entity15			0
@entity34 ( 2012/13 ) : 17 goals in 35 games @entity15 ( 2013/14 ) : 13 goals in 26 games @entity1 knows his first - team chances at @entity21 will be heavily restricted under @entity8 and feels his long - term future lies elsewhere			2
despite the fact he he has started just one @entity31 game since joining in 2011 , @entity4 are looking to make a profit on @entity1			0
he signed from @entity46 for £ 18m , but the @entity32 will start the bidding for the 20 - year - old at around £ 20m given his successful loan spells at @entity34 and @entity15			0
@entity2 have already registered their interest in @entity1 despite the lingering uncertainty surrounding their management team next season			1
domino effect : @entity7 's @entity5 is likely to have a bearing on @entity1 's prospective transfer spent force ? @entity4 are keen to recruit strikers to help @entity59 and @entity60 in attack flop : @entity62 has been disappointing since signing for @entity2 last summer they are also monitoring the performances for @entity66 's highly - rated striker @entity65 , who shares the same agent as @entity1			1
likewise , @entity15 are interested in keeping @entity1 on a permanent basis , but their chances of funding a deal for the giant striker are likely to rest on qualification for the @entity73 .			2

@entity4 want at least £ *20million* for @entity1 this summer
@entity27 striker 's future *hinges* on whether @entity5 joins from @entity7
@entity2 have already registered an interest in @entity15 loanee @entity1
