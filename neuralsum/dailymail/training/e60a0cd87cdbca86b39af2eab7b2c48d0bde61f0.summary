it has long been thought that hunting was the cause of the creatures ’ extinction , but researchers have now revised their opinion			0
they believe a huge meteor smashing through the @entity15 's atmosphere broke up into ten million tonnes of fiery fragments , scattering over four continents			1
these fragments are thought to have released toxic gas which poisoned the air and blacked out the sun , causing temperatures to plummet , plants to die and landscapes to alter forever			1
the woolly mammoth was probably wiped out by rapid climate change caused by a meteor striking the @entity15 , not by overhunting as previously believed research published in the @entity29 suggests that this caused the extinction , countering previous theories that the spread of human settlements and aggressive hunting was to blame			1
after the impact , some animal species , like humans , adapted by either moving away , downsizing to adapt to the resources around them , or simply changed their way of life to cope			1
but other species , including the woolly mammoth which roamed throughout @entity48 , parts of @entity43 and @entity44 in vast numbers , did not adapt and were wiped out in a generation			1
the research says the impact changed the course of the @entity15 's history forever			1
according to anthropologist and geology professor @entity58 , the change from booming population to total extinction happened ' within a lifetime '			0
the @entity61 professor said : ‘ imagine living in a time when you look outside and there are elephants walking around @entity61			0
‘ but by the time you are at the end of your years there are no more elephants			2
it happens within your lifetime			0
’ working with scientists all over the world , the team found evidence of burnt out fragments of carbon - called spherules - in sites on four continents , and all dating back 12,800 years			1
a meteor is thought to have stuck the @entity15 12,800 years ago releasing toxic gases into the air and temporarily blocking out the sun causing temperatures to plummet they examined the bedrock dating back to the ice age in 20 archaeological sites in the world which date back to this formative period in the @entity15 's history			1
the timing matches the known dates of the last woolly mammoths to roam the planet , along with other ice age creatures like the sabre tooth tiger			2
a meteorite hitting the @entity15 's surface or simply breaking up as it passed through the atmosphere , would cause a sudden and drastic change in the weather			1
professor @entity58 said : ‘ this likely cause climate change and climate change forced this scenario			0
you can move , downsize or you can go extinct			0
‘ humans at the time were just as resourceful and intelligent as we are today			0
with mammoth off the dinner table , humans were forced to adapt which they did to great success			2
’ he added that the lessons learned from that time could apply to today as the @entity15 again goes through a period of ‘ rapid and profound ’ climate change			2
he said : ‘ it 's a reminder of how fragile we are			0
imagine an explosion that happened today that went across four continents			0
‘ the human species would go on			2
but it would be different			0
it would be a game changer			0

a meteor hitting the @entity15 12,800 years ago released toxic gases into the air and blocked out the sun causing temperatures to plummet and plants to die
some species managed to adapt but the woolly mammoth died out
