angry shoppers yesterday accused stores of ripping them off with bogus discounts as millions of people flocked to the @entity8 sales consumer groups warned shoppers to be on their guard against such ‘ pseudo-sales ’ , in which prices are inflated just before they are discounted so that the deal looks better than it actually is			1

’ meanwhile @entity71 worker @entity70 , from @entity72 , wrote : ‘ @ homebase_uk i ’m not impressed how you increased the prices of what i wanted to buy by 28 % just before your 20 % sale			0
’ ‘ it now costs more ! ! ! ‘ disgraceful practice of putting up prices just before announcing your 20 % sale – what a con ! ! ’			0
a spokeswoman for @entity83 said : ' @entity83 has genuine offers and we fully adhere to the law surrounding pricing and promotion , taking into account pricing guidance			0
in doing this we work closely with @entity91			0
' we update our pricing frequently to ensure that we offer customers the best deals in what is a highly complex and competitive trading environment			0

thousands queued to be first through the doors at @entity105 in @entity106 on @entity8 under @entity91 rules , pre-sale prices should be the last price at which goods were offered – and the goods should have been at that price for 28 consecutive days in the previous six months			1
which ? has previously attacked supermarkets for pulling a similar stunt			0
some stores were found to inflate prices for just a few days , before promoting their products as being half - price or better for weeks afterwards			1
the consumer group said chains were exploiting loopholes in fair - trading legislation to advertise offers on items such as fruit and wine ‘ that might mislead you into thinking you are getting an extra-special bargain when you are not ’			1
yesterday @entity130 , managing editor of @entity131 urged customers to be careful when shopping in the @entity8 sales to ensure the discounts advertised were genuine			1
he said : ‘ we know that prices are being manipulated in some stores , which is disingenuous			1
shops put the price up a few days before they put the goods in the sale , which dilutes the true value of the sale			0
it is easy to get seduced by labels offering 50 per cent off or three for two			0
what is more important is whether it is good value			0
though record sales were taken , this year marked the first year there were more online shoppers than those on the @entity48 ‘ just because it is in the sale it does not automatically mean you are getting the best price			1
’ yesterday , retailers were celebrating bumper sales			0
@entity105 said online sales figures for @entity39 were double last year ’s , but in a sign that shoppers have not yet deserted the high street , 120,000 people visited its @entity165 store yesterday			2

@entity186 wrote : ‘ fight in @entity188 sale because someone pushed in			0
’ overwhelmed shoppers took to @entity15 to describe fights breaking out in stores like @entity188 and @entity184 many shoppers admitted snapping up the discounted designer goods so they could sell them online			1

some of them will be gifts for my family , the rest i ’ll be putting straight on @entity205			0
