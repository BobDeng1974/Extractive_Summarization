supermarket giant @entity0 is facing a hefty fine of at least $ 4 million for lying to shoppers about the freshness of its bread			1
last year , @entity0 was found guilty for its ‘ made today , sold today ’ slogan , which was deemed misleading by the @entity8 in june			1
the supermarket was slapped with a three - year ban to no longer promote its bread as baked on the day it is sold or made from fresh dough			0
but lawyers for @entity0 claimed that the average shopper ' does n't care ' that the supermarket 's in - store bread offering is n't entirely fresh , the @entity13 reports			2
the @entity8 banned @entity0 from advertising its par - baked bread from being baked fresh on the day it is sold for three years the falsified fresh bread has generated a revenue of about $ 300 million for @entity0 after an investigation into the marketing tactics conducted by the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) , the @entity8 on tuesday has sought penalties of at least $ 4 - $ 5 million over the breaches to the @entity28 consumer law			1
