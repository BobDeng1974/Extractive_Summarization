by @entity0 a family were left baffled after discovering a strange ‘ sea monster ’ washed up on a @entity4 beach			1
@entity5 , 42 , chanced upon the creature while out walking the family dog with husband , @entity9 , 52 , and their two children			1
the two - foot long skeletal remains were found on the high tide mark on the beach in @entity15 , north @entity16			1
@entity5 , a stay - at - home mother , from @entity26 , near @entity27 , said : ' it was really quite strange			1
we were just walking the dogs when we stumbled across it			1
' people have come up with some crazy ideas as to what it could be			2
my friend even thought it could be a llama , as the long tail - y bit looks like a neck			1
odd : the remains baffled one marine biologist , who declared that he 'd never seen anything like it before hot - spot : @entity15 , in north @entity16 , is popular with tourists in part thanks to its huge beach ' i guess with it being washed up on the beach you would expect it to be a fish or something , but it does n't look very fishy			1
' my son was fascinated by it			2
i 've definitely not seen anything like it before			0
he wanted to take it to school for show and tell			0
' he carried it home in a big carrier bag			0
it absolutely stinks now though			0
i ’ve told him he ’s going to have to get rid of it			0
' the family posted an image of the skeleton on @entity73 where speculation grew about what the creature could be			1
mystery solved ? one marine biologist believe the skeleton could be that of a thornback ray ( pictured ) some suggested the animal was a lizard or swan whilst others claimed it was some kind of large fish or stingray			1
@entity91 biologist , @entity90 , said : ' this is certainly nothing i have seen before			1
' other deep sea creature experts said that it was likely the skeleton was that of a thornback ray			0
@entity98 , a professor at @entity99 , said : ' i think that is the remains of a thornback ray ( @entity102 )			2
' they are fairly common on muddy / sandy substrates around the @entity4 and @entity105			0
' the photos certainly make it look like a weird deep sea creature			0
you would n't want to inadvertently step on that tail ! ' the discovery followed a rare bluefin tuna worth close to £ 1million being brought ashore by five university friends in @entity114			0
another remarkable find : five university friends found a rare bluefin tuna in @entity114 , worth around £ 1million strict @entity118 laws designed to protect the critically endangered species – which are highly prized in @entity120 for raw fish dishes such as sushi and sashimi – mean it is illegal to catch or sell them			2
so @entity126 , 22 , @entity127 and @entity128 , both 23 , and @entity129 and @entity130 , both 24 , will not make a penny from the extraordinary find they made while holidaying in @entity114			0
the 7ft 1in specimen , which was perfectly edible , has been sitting in a fisherman ’s freezer prior to being taken to the @entity137 on sunday where it will be dissected and studied by experts , rather than served up in a restaurant			0
