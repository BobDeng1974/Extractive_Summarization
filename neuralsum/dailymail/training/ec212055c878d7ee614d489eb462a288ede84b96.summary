as a blue and red 16 - seater plane accelerated along a runway last month in northern @entity3 , there was nothing to suggest its voyage was anything out of the ordinary			1
but minutes later , as the plane turned north and began a 500 - mile round trip from @entity12 to @entity13 , history was made			1
once the craft was safely at cruising altitude , the pilot flicked a switch and handed over to a trained controller sitting at a computer screen many miles away on the ground			2
ambitious : for the first time in aviation history , a ' pilotless ' passenger plane was flying over mainland @entity24 recently			1
this is a file picture for the first time in aviation history , a ‘ pilotless ’ passenger plane was flying over mainland @entity24			1
that concept might make many people uneasy			2
but , according to the air industry , it is the future of flight			1
some predict that within five , ten or 20 years , commercial jets will be flown routinely by remote control over our towns and cities			2
so will we ever get used to climbing aboard our holiday flight to @entity40 or @entity41 and , instead of being greeted with a welcome from an upbeat and commanding captain , be met only with an automated message ? and those soothing words of reassurance in mid-air as the plane is buffeted through a nasty patch of turbulence ? they , too , could soon be a thing of the past			1
supporters of so - called ‘ autonomous aircraft ’ justify their developments on safety grounds			1
if most accidents are caused by human error , they argue , then surely it makes sense to remove people from the equation ? but the arrival of such craft in our skies raises disturbing questions			2
some fear it could make passengers more vulnerable to computer failure and put planes at greater risk of being hijacked by cyber-terrorists hacking into control systems			0
bold : some predict that within five , ten or 20 years , commercial jets will be flown routinely by remote control over our towns and cities and however much the industry might insist on their absolute safety , how many of us would actually dare to go up in such an aircraft ? @entity24 and the @entity87 have been using unmanned military drone aircraft for years			1
however , the next generation of pilotless planes are not designed for warfare , but to fly passengers and cargo around the globe			1
last month ’s test flight over the @entity96 was part of the @entity99 project — the £ 62 million @entity101 programme funded by industry and the government			1
the @entity99 team took a standard @entity106 aircraft and added banks of computers , sensors and high definition cameras to turn it into an experimental ‘ uninhabited air vehicle ’			1
the craft — nicknamed the @entity113 — is able to cruise in @entity24 airspace with no human involvement , though not yet without any humans on board			1
the high - definition cameras in the cockpit and underneath the craft scan the skies for weather systems and feed the information back to the computerised navigation system , allowing the craft to change course automatically to avoid storms and turbulence			0
meanwhile , cameras are on the look out for mid-air hazards such as other aircraft , weather balloons and even parachutes			0
worrying : criticis say there have been 100 drone crashes since 2007 - including nine since the start of the year			0
this is a file picture of a drone plane again , the computer ’s ‘ sense and avoid ’ technology will adjust the navigation if something is on collision course			1
manufacturer @entity148 boasts it can track up to 20,000 objects simultaneously			0
the aircraft ’s progress is monitored on the ground by an operator who is sent , via radio and satellite , the images taken by the cameras , and the data from the plane ’s sensors			1
the operator can override the plane ’s computers and fly or land the craft by remote control if needed			1
but if contact is lost — say the signals fail — the plane is programmed to land safely by itself			1
it is given potential landing strips — such as playing fields or other flat areas — and uses heat sensors and optical cameras to check if they are free from obstacles or people before landing			0
under existing @entity96 aviation rules , the @entity106 is unable to take off and land autonomously			0
so during the most recent test flight , two pilots sat in the cockpit to control both operations			1
in between , they sipped cups of coffee			0
on the outbound flight from @entity192 in @entity12 the pilots passed control to a ground - based operator once take - off was complete			1
on the return flight , control was given to the onboard navigation and robotics system			1
@entity148 says the technology has been tested on 11 aircraft and on 80 flights over the past year , including a simulated search - and - rescue mission using two unmanned craft			0
in tests , it was shown to be as effective and safe as a human pilot			0
the firm believes the pilotless craft could be used within five to ten years for scientific experiments — examining weather or volcanic ash clouds — or search - and - rescue missions			1
after that , they could be used as cargo planes			0
the industry believes automated planes will be safer — and will do away with pilot error , a major cause of accidents			1
@entity220 , @entity221 at @entity148 , says : ‘ unmanned civil aircraft are an exciting new opportunity			1
we see these aircraft undertaking dangerous roles in poor conditions			0
such as search - and - rescue missions			0
’ there is no talk yet of introducing it for passenger flights , but that could soon change , especially when you consider that another advantage of abolishing cockpit pilots is that it saves money			1
one ground - based operator could , in theory , keep an eye on several planes at once			0
way forward : pilots could soon be a thing of the past and , unlike humans , computers do n’t get tired , do n’t need lavatory breaks , do n’t have unions and do n’t need regular rest periods ( or get drunk at parties with stewardesses the night before they fly )			0
@entity148 also points out that aircraft have been controlled by computers for years			0
on a typical long - distance flight , autopilots fly the plane for between 80 and 90 per cent of the trip			1
and that ’s not just the dull bits in the middle either			0
many commercial pilots routinely land at @entity262 with the help of automated systems			0
before unmanned craft routinely take to the skies , the flight rules would need to be overhauled			1
to do that , the industry will need to convince regulators that their automated systems are foolproof			2
yet computer software , as we are reminded almost daily , has a nasty habit of going wrong			0
last year , a fault in the banking software of @entity277 and the @entity278 left many of its 17 million customers unable to check accounts or access money			0
the bank suffered another , unrelated failure in march			0
naturally , the aviation industry insists robotic planes will be packed with safety features			2
but while automation has — statistically speaking — made flying safer than ever , accidents still happen			0
on february 25 , 2009 , a @entity292 @entity291 dropped out of the sky short of @entity294 ’s @entity294 , killing nine people , including all three of the cabin crew			0
the crash was caused by a faulty radio altimeter — a device that monitors a plane ’s altitude using radio waves — which also controlled the aircraft ’s automatic thrust systems			2
the auto - thrust wrongly believed the plane was just above the runway and cut power to the engines			2
the crew tried to regain control , but the automatic systems would n’t let them and the plane fell into a field			2
in the same year , @entity314 crashed into the @entity315 , killing 228 people , after the autopilot switched itself off and the plane stalled at 38,000ft			2
@entity318 , who runs the website @entity96 , believes remote - controlled planes are unreliable			2
he has collated details of around 100 drone crashes since 2007 — including nine since the start of the year			0
‘ there are huge safety concerns , but the industry likes to play them down , ’ he says			1
‘ the technology they use is akin to wireless technology , and we know how hard it is to stay connected when you are moving			2
’ on top of all this is the threat from cyber-jackers			2
in 2011 , @entity338 took control of a remotely operated @entity341 spy plane			2
the @entity338 government claimed it was brought down by its ‘ cyber warfare unit ’ , which took over the controls and safely landed it			1
the idea of terrorists doing the same to a civilian or cargo jet is terrifying			0
and there ’s a broader concern to the development of this kind of technology			0
we do n’t just face a future of pilotless planes			1
scientists are , for example , developing computer - driven buses , lorries , cars and trains — all on ‘ safety grounds ’			1
you do n’t have to be a fan of science fiction movies such as @entity367 — in which robots try to take over the world — to feel uneasy about taking away the human element from transport			0
there are times when the operator of any vehicle has to make a split - second moral decision			0
a lorry driver may have to choose whether to veer away from a car coming in the opposite direction and plough into a group of pedestrians			0
do we really want computers making those choices over life and death ? ‘ there is this view among engineers that humans are the weakest part of any system and should be removed , ’ says mr @entity318			1
‘ but that ’s not the case			2
human ethics and morality should n’t just be programmed away			0

the air industry believes it is the future of flight
