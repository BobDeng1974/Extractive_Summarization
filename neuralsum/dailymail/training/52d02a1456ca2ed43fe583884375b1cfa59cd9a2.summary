@entity2 blamed @entity14 activists from the anarchist group @entity16 for helping migrants set up illegal squats in unoccupied flats , houses and commercial property in central @entity9			1
the group , which campaigns for an end to immigration controls , is trying to give the migrants shelter in @entity26 before they attempt their illegal entry into the @entity14			2
mrs @entity2 , 50 , has previously blamed @entity14 ’s asylum and benefits system for ‘ imposing ’ hundreds of illegal migrants on her city			1
she said the number of people trying to make it across the @entity6 was becoming ‘ untenable ’ and radical action was needed			1
in a move that has caused controversy in @entity26 , she made a plea to residents to report squats used by @entity14 - bound illegal immigrants so that they can be shut down			1
she has offered an email address which can be used anonymously to pinpoint groups of immigrants – as well as the @entity14 activists who help them – so police can visit the buildings and clear them out			1
she called the dozens of squats ‘ a plague which is spreading to the town centre , disturbing the peace of residents and tarnishing the town ’s image ’			0
she added : ‘ it is scandalous that we live in a state where foreigners come here to disturb our town and our residents			0
@entity59 : migrants in @entity9 wait for a chance to cross the @entity6 into @entity14 hunger strike : some of the @entity63 occupying a footbridge at the @entity9 ferry terminal earlier this month stand off : @entity26 @entity67 riot police stand guard as @entity63 asylum seekers hold their position behind a banner on a footbridge at the ferry terminal in @entity9 ' the migrants fight among each other and we do not feel there is any security at all			1
’ mrs @entity2 , who was born in @entity26 to an @entity79 father and a @entity81 mother , complained to @entity83 - born interior minister @entity82 that she lacked powers to take direct action against squatters and asked for @entity9 to be declared a high - priority security zone			1
on her @entity90 page , the mayor asked people to report squatters and no @entity16 activists who helped them find squats			1
she wrote : ‘ do not hesitate to email if you see no @entity16 or migrants settling illegally in a house			1
in this way the police can act by way of a procedure which can be enacted 48 hours after an intrusion property has been reported			0
’ many have travelled from countries like @entity63 and @entity105 , and often pay people smugglers thousands of pounds for a place on a lorry or train across the @entity6			2
@entity109 , a supporter of mrs @entity2 , wrote on her @entity90 page : ‘ the idea of launching an email address to report the squats is a good idea			1
' it ’s necessary to know that the migrants are being manipulated by @entity16 and by the people smugglers			1
‘ they are being used for political purposes , to the detriment of the people of @entity9			0
’ but opponents have accused mrs @entity2 , a member of the opposition @entity122 party , of pandering to the far - right			2
they say she is trying to stir up hatred of the hundreds who are on their way to @entity14 to try to claim asylum , or else to start working in the black economy			0

no @entity16 is a shadowy group of activists campaigning for an end to immigration controls across @entity158			2
motivated by an anarchist ideology , the @entity14 branch seeks to help migrants get around immigration rules and prepare them for life after illegal entry into the @entity14			2
activists tell illegal immigrants not to answer any questions if they are stopped by the @entity169 ( pictured ) the group has been recruiting volunteers from throughout @entity14 , most of them ex-students			2
once recruited , they make regular trips to @entity26 to give would - be migrants food , sleeping bags , books and even phones and bikes , as well as helping them to find squats in towns such as @entity9			1
they are also trained to advise on means of illegal entry into the @entity14 and what to do once a migrant arrives here			0
the group ’s website describes itself as the @entity14 branch of an anarchist network that began in @entity158 in 1999			0
it says it has no organised central structure , and is instead a loose collection of individuals who want to erase the borders created by ‘ capitalist elites ’			0
the @entity14 website for @entity16 lists email addresses and phone numbers for several groups in the country , and details regular meetings in cities including @entity205 and @entity206			1
one piece of advice they give illegal immigrants is not to answer any questions if they are stopped by the @entity169			0
