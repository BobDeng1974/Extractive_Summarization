human rights judges yesterday saved @entity2 taxpayers from a multi-million pound compensation bill in a ruling on prisoner voting			1
the @entity7 court said it was wrong to deny inmates the vote but refused to order damages to be paid out to them			2
the decision came after ten @entity2 inmates had argued their human rights were breached by not being allowed to vote in the 2009 @entity16 elections			1
judges also deprived ambulance - chasing lawyers of the chance of a fat pay day by dismissing their claims for costs in bringing the case			1
the @entity24 in the @entity26 city of @entity27 has ruled that @entity2 's blanket ban on prisoners voting is illegal they declared that the prisoners ‘ only needed to fill in an application form ’ and ‘ did not need legal assistance ’			1
this decision lifts the threat of huge payouts for more than 1,000 claims thought to be in the pipeline which are now unlikely to be brought			2
however , the ruling on voting re-enforces a 2004 verdict that the @entity2 ’s blanket ban on convicted prisoners taking part in elections violated the @entity46			1
upholding this basic principle means that the row over prisoner voting will continue to dog @entity50			1
it has become symbolic of the power struggle between @entity54 and the @entity24 , and will add to @entity56 pressure for a showdown			2
@entity59 ( left ) , the justice secretary , wants mps to decide whether or not to keep the ban on prisoners voting ; @entity63 ( right ) the perverted scout leader and former deputy headmaster jailed in 2003 yesterday the @entity66 revealed that the court ’s interference has persuaded home secretary @entity69 to advise mr @entity50 that @entity2 must withdraw from the convention , which it exists to enforce			2
sources close to justice secretary @entity59 said @entity74 ’s @entity73 , which makes @entity7 rights part of @entity2 law , would be repealed if the @entity78 win next year ’s election			2
‘ decisions like these should be made in this country , ’ they said			0
‘ a @entity56 government will make wholesale changes to human rights laws so this kind of decision will be taken by @entity54 – not an international court			2
’ the latest twist in the battle over prisoners came after seven judges ruled that ten men held in @entity95 jails were wrongly barred from the 2009 poll			1
two judges had dissented , condemning the court ’s thinking as a mess and insisting there was nothing wrong with the @entity2 law			0
they added the prisoners were wrong not to disclose details of their sentences to the court			0
but the two were in a minority and the @entity27 court reiterated its condemnation of the centuries - old @entity2 practice of barring prisoners from voting			1
on rejecting any compensation , they declared that the satisfaction of having their complaint upheld was enough of a remedy for the ten inmates			0
the refusal to pay legal costs chiefly affected @entity123 and @entity124 , solicitors based in @entity125 , @entity126			0
the firm has been involved in a number of claims over the issue			0
in 2004 , the first test case on prisoner voting , involving axe killer @entity133 , forced the government to pay nearly £ 10,000 in legal costs			1
during a second major case in 2010 , the @entity27 court offered £ 4,000 in legal costs to two other @entity95 prisoners represented by @entity123 and @entity124			1
the row with @entity7 has troubled both @entity74 and @entity56 governments			0
successive prime ministers have stood by the ban and it has been endorsed by mps in repeated debates and votes , most recently in 2011			0
yesterday the @entity147 said any decision on whether prisoners can vote will remain a matter for @entity2 mps			0
@entity78 said the court had made a political retreat in the face of warnings of a @entity2 withdrawal from @entity158 institutions			0
@entity160 mp @entity159 said the decision was ‘ a rare outbreak of commonsense from this federalist court ’ .			0

@entity24 says blanket prisoner voting ban illegal
but judges in @entity27 reject calls for compensation to prisoners
ministers *feared* an *avalanche* of claims following today 's judgement
case brought by 10 @entity95 prisoners - *including* *sex* *offenders*
they said their human rights were breached during 2009 @entity7 elections
