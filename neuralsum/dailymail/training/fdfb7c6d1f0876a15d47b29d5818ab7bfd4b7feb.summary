adventurer @entity0 headed out into the @entity2 today to begin his second bid to live for two months on @entity5 's loneliest outpost , @entity6			1
his last attempt to break the record for living alone on the tiny , remote rock in the @entity10 ended before it even began at the end of may last year			1
heavy seas stopped him leaving his boat and he was forced to make the 15 - hour return trip to @entity15 on nearby @entity16			0
not particularly inviting : @entity6 in the @entity2 is an isolated pinnacle which only four people have ever managed to sleep on ready : @entity0 left for @entity6 today but now the chartered surveyor and former @entity21 cadet is to try again by landing on the rock tomorrow , weather permitting			1
on @entity24 announced : ' we 're heading to # @entity6 today ! ' before loading his equipment on to the chartered @entity28 boat at @entity15 on @entity16 in the @entity10			0
@entity0 , 38 , from @entity29 near @entity30 , is raising money for the charity @entity32 , and plans to make regular broadcasts for tv and social media from @entity6			1
@entity0 has been practising load winching to ensure he gets his survival pod - created from an 8ft yellow water tank and powered by a small wind turbine and solar panels for charging his satellite communications - up on to @entity6			1
' the only real physical side is the initial climb and hauling the pod and equipment up , ' he says			2
the occupiable area of @entity6 , named in 1955 as @entity47 after the first recorded person to land there , is just 11ft by 4ft , and is 13ft below the summit			0
the ' rockpod ' footprint will leave accessible only the flattish platform on the summit for mr @entity0 to scramble up to for exercise			2
last year @entity0 set off for @entity6 , an eroded volcano , which lies 260 miles west of the @entity10 with the intention of spending 60 days on the remote sea rock , which is just 100ft wide and 70ft high			1
he had taken all food and water with him and planned to live in a 23 stone shelter bolted to the rock in his bid to break the current 42 - day record			1
but when he arrived , the swell around the rock made it impossible for him to safely scramble @entity65 also admitted his wife @entity66 did not want him to go			2
the couple have a two - year - old son @entity68			0
survival pod : @entity0 's bright yellow pod , made from a 8ft water tank will be his home during his isolation @entity75 activists were the last to occupy @entity6 in 1997 in protest at plans to expand oil exploration @entity0 , who in 2012 stayed for a short while on @entity6 as part of a reconnaissance mission for last year 's mission , had aimed to set two endurance records on the isolated islet and raise Â£ 10,000 for the @entity32 charity			1
@entity6 is constantly pounded by 3,000 miles of @entity2 swell			0
the world 's largest recorded oceanic waves of over 95 feet were recorded there in 2000 - some 19 feet higher than @entity6 itself			0
being in such an isolated location , only four people have ever slept there , and less than 100 have landed on it			0
the first record for time spent on @entity6 was 40 days in 1985 , when @entity97 soldier @entity96 lived on the rock from 26 may to 4 july to affirm @entity5 's claim to the islet , which has been disputed by @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			2
his record was broken in 1997 by three @entity75 activists who stayed there for 42 days in protest at north @entity2 oil exploration .			0

only four people have ever managed to spend a night on the rock , which is just 100ft wide and 70ft high
@entity0 hopes to raise money for @entity32 charity and will live in an 8 foot long ' survival pod '
his first attempt to break the current record failed *due* to *bad* weather
