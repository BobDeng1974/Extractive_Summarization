' i heard whispers , so i needed to know ' ‘ i think in this case , the county court judge went further than that because of the level of deceit and the fact that mr @entity7 ’s new wife is too old to give him children , so he has lost his chance of fatherhood			1
’ speaking for the first time about the controversial case , mr @entity7 , 46 , from @entity54 , said : ‘ it ’s like a bereavement because i have lost the children i believed were mine			1
‘ i treated them both as if they were my own			0

' she has never even said sorry ' @entity9 was born in 1992 , with mr @entity7 present at the birth and signing the birth certificate			1
two years later @entity8 was born , with mr @entity7 still having no reason to suspect that @entity11 had been unfaithful			1
mr @entity7 said : ‘ my life seemed complete			1
we had moved into a house , i was happily married , had a good job and two healthy children – what more could i want ? ’ but by 2004 the marriage was struggling			1
mr @entity7 explained : ‘ @entity11 was disappearing for several days without telling me where she was going			1
i only found out from used train and coach tickets i discovered			0
‘ i would collect the children from school as usual and walk into the house and it would be empty with no note or anything			2
@entity11 would go to places such as @entity118 or @entity119 , and if i asked why she had gone there she would say , “ nothing to do with you			0

finally i said i wanted dna testing			0
’ the dna test was done by mouth swab and when the result came back mr @entity7 was stunned			1
he said : ‘ when i saw the letter stating that i was n’t @entity9 ’s father i just broke down			2
‘ when i phoned @entity11 we had an argument and she just said , “ what did you expect			0
” she did n’t even say sorry			0
’ mr @entity7 did n’t tell @entity9 but he described in court documents how her attitude changed towards him			2
he said : ‘ she did n’t come to see me and if i saw her in the street she would make obscene gestures with her fingers and on one occasion even kicked my car			0
