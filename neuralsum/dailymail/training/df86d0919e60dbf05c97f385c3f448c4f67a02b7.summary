‘ i kept him off school on july 2 and sent him back on the thursday but again the staff had tipped his juice away and refilled it with water			1
‘ bearing in mind it was a really hot week with temperatures of @entity41 outside , it must have been hitting @entity42 in the classrooms and my son was unable to drink			0

she said : ‘ it is part of their health policy but how is it helpful for my son to become dehydrated and unable to concentrate in lessons ? ‘ of course i 'd prefer him to drink water because it 's healthier but at this stage i want him to drink rather than being left with nothing			0
‘ i do n't think the school should me to make my son drink something he does n't like			0
‘ the school is being totally ludicrous and contradicting its own health policy because they are giving out treats as rewards			0
