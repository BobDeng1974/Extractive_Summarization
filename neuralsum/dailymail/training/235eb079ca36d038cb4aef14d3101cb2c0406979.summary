weapons that dominated @entity1 for more than 3,000 years were introduced by the ancient @entity3 civilisation , according to a new study			1
swords , metal battle axes , long bladed spears , shields and possibly even armour were brought to @entity1 by the @entity3 who ruled @entity10			1
the finding overturns the popular perception originally put forward by archaeologists that @entity10 was one of the most peaceful civilisations in history			1

since towns and palaces in @entity10 , the home of the mythical minotaur , were first dug up and studied a century ago the @entity3 have been widely regarded by archaeologists as an essentially peaceful people			1
the reputation was built up because of what was perceived as a lack of images of war preserved in jewellery , frescoes and other artifacts at the @entity19 and other key sites			0
but a reassessment of the role of warriors and weapons in @entity10 , which was at its peak from 1900bc to @entity40 , now concludes that the @entity3 were a violent and warlike people			1
dr @entity41 , an archaeologist at the @entity42 , carried out the study and concluded that there was ‘ a staggering amount of violence ’ in @entity3 society			2
‘ their world was uncovered just over a century ago , and was deemed to be a largely peaceful society , ’ he said			0
‘ in time , many took this to be a paradigm of a society that was devoid of war , where warriors and violence were shunned and played no significant role			2
bull - leaping shown in a @entity3 fresco was a skill that would have been prized by a military elite , dr @entity41 says			0
‘ that utopian view has not survived into modern scholarship , but it remains in the background unchallenged and still crops up in modern texts and popular culture with surprising frequency			2
" in fact it is to @entity10 we must look for the origin of those weapons that were to dominate @entity1 until the @entity74 , namely swords , metal battle - axes , shields , spears and probably armour also			1
’ the double - headed battle - axes would have made a lethal close - quarters weapon that could hook over and drag down an opponent 's shield , while a spear - head that was designed to punch through armour			0

such military hardware , he said , was honed by the @entity95 before being taken up by other @entity1 civilisations , including the @entity97			0
he started looking at just how peaceful or warlike @entity10 was and soon realised there was not just a wealth of evidence of violence but that warfare was ‘ a defining characteristic of the @entity3 society ’			1
images of bull - leaping , boxing , wrestling and hunting were accompanied by symbols of a warrior elite , he said , and that it was an expression of male identity			0
artistic impression of the bustling market place at @entity19			0
‘ ideologies of war are shown to have permeated religion , art , industry , politics and trade , and the social practices surrounding martial traditions were demonstrably a structural part of how this society evolved and how they saw themselves , ’ he said			2
‘ there were few spheres of interaction in @entity10 that did not have a martial component , right down to the symbols used in their written scripts			1
’ in a paper - martial minoans ? war as social process , practice and event in @entity140 - published in the @entity141 , he said @entity95 weapons illustrated the transition from ‘ the use of the tools of hunting ’ to ‘ purpose - designed weapons of war ’			0
he added : ‘ the introduction of the sword represented a quantum leap in combat practice			0

minoan culture was permeated by warfare and violence
weapons used in @entity10 remained in use until advent of gunpowder
