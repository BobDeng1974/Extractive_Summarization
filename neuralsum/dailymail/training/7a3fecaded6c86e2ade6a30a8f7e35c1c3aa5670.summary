i asked them for advice , ' she said of her decision to have the treatment after joining the cast of @entity0			1
' i was n't really thinking about the needles , just about the results			0
' but the procedure did n't give her the look she 'd hoped for			2
her lips became swollen and painful as she had a bad reaction to the filler			1
she explains : ' the filler reacted in my lips and i got a wedge of it that was pushing out on either side			1
i thought if my lips crack , that will be it , my face will be ruined for life			1
' the swelling did subside but the lumps of filler remained making her lips look and feel uneven			1
' i regret how my lips are now , i can hide the lumps of filler with make up but it feels disgusting , ' she told tv presenter @entity60 on @entity62 's @entity61			1
@entity64 's natural look in 2013 , left , and in 2014 , right , after the filler which made her lips lumpy and painful @entity64 with @entity0 co-star @entity66 , left , in 2013 before she had the lip filler injected the make - up artist agreed to appear on the @entity62 show in the hope she would make other people think twice about having surgery to change their looks			1
she said : ' now my lips are bruised and painful , i did n't realise how fake the filler would make me look			1
i have ruined my looks for nothing			0

the reality tv star , pictured after the lip filler treatment when she used make - up to hide the lumps , said she wishes she had never had the procedure @entity64 with @entity61 presenter @entity60 after having a painful reversal treatment to make her lips look more natural again her father said : ' her lips were fine as they were , no parent wants their child to be adjusting things			1
' her lips do n't look natural now , they look painful			1

it breaks my heart you had to do that as naturally you had lovely lips			2

this involves having more injections in her lips to inject a chemical to break down the filler			2
despite the area being numbed first , @entity64 squeals in pain as the needle is inserted in her upper lip			0
dr @entity125 who carried out the reversal surgery on @entity64 said : ' @entity64 came to see me after a lip augmentation with dermal fillers had unfortunately gone terribly wrong			2
dermal fillers carry real risk of cyst formation , infection , allergy and scarring and it 's important to be aware of these as part of doing your research when seeking these procedures			0
' over several weeks i saw @entity64 in stages we worked to drain and remove deep cysts , free scar tissue and dissolve filler which had been misplaced			2
' it was a painful process for her but she was been brave throughout , recovered well and is now looking better than ever			2
' cases like @entity64 's i see more and more , and it 's important for patients to seek out the right qualified professional to undergo these procedures and not base their choice on cost			0
finding a skilled professional you can trust is priceless			0
they will always guide and help you and be there to help'you if things do n't go as planned			0
