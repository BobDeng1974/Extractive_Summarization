penalties are absolute agony at any time and i ’ve been in teams for club and country where they were needed			0
the pressure is so extreme , the expectations massive , your legs are hollow			1
can you even begin to imagine then the pressure @entity12 must have been under ? not just the entire home nation expecting you to win but fears about what could happen to the tournament and around the country if they lost			1
it was the most intense , frantic game of the tournament so far			0
we were in the studio in @entity23 , backing on to the beach and there was a two - hour frenzy behind us to a soundtrack of fireworks			1
@entity29 and despair : @entity31 celebrates @entity12 's penalty shoot out win over @entity34 saved ! @entity35 keeps @entity37 spot kick out as @entity12 progress thank goodness for the tournament that @entity12 won			1
it keeps the party alive			1
but the way they only just managed to sneak past @entity34 into the quarter - finals highlighted again the defensive frailties we ’ve been talking about for weeks			2
but @entity48 was electric in the opening 45 minutes			0
@entity49 had an eventful day , involved in everything			0
it was a shame his goal was ruled out because it came from a great ball , take and finish			0
@entity48 has coped unbelievably with the pressure of a nation ’s hopes on his shoulders			2
even his spot - kick betrayed no nerves			2
for all @entity12 ’s flair though , their weaknesses have worried more from their opening game			1
three of that back four are not natural defenders : @entity70 and @entity71 are attacking full - backs with the emphasis strictly on the attack and @entity31 also has instincts to get out			2
it ’s dangerous that their first priority does not appear to be defending			0
leap of faith : @entity31 jumps for joy as @entity12 beats @entity34 flat out : @entity34 's players look dejected as @entity12 celebrate end of the world : the @entity34 players look dejected as they walk off at the end of the game i has similar instincts myself as a young player at @entity89 but @entity90 , a defensive coach , drilled me hard on the training field , instilling in me the absolute importance of my specific trade			1
it was all about the heading , one versus ones , aggression , body position , movement of your feet			0
@entity12 ’s defenders have n’t done it			1
the @entity104 goal in the group game was a prime example			0
they were beaten too easily one against one , @entity108 allowed the ball past him too easily at the front post , @entity31 did n’t know where the striker was			0
he did n’t even have a look or open his shoulders so he could see both ball and man more easily			0
golden boy : @entity48 celebrates after scoring his penalty on we go : @entity120 celebrates @entity12 beating @entity34 on penalties marching on : @entity12 's goalkeeper @entity35 celebrates with his team after saving the decisive penalty defenders are taught this			1
and @entity71 was almost on the edge of the box , not even thinking to defend the far post to cover @entity31			0
@entity48 carried @entity12 through that group			1
but he alone can not win the @entity130 with that leaky defence			2
@entity132 is an interviewer , programme - maker and football expert for @entity135			2

the pressure on @entity12 to win the penalty shoot - out was massive
@entity12 winning keeps the party alive but they must *improve*
defensively @entity12 have been poor and must get better if they are to go further
