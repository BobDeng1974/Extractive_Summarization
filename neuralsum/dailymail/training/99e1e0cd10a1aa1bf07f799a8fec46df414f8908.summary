by @entity0 the @entity2 ’s @entity1 has been accused of giving its @entity4 guests an easier ride than @entity7 politicians			1
a leaked briefing note for host @entity9 revealed he was urged to ask many more questions of former deputy prime minister , @entity11 , than the @entity4 work and pensions spokesman @entity13			1
the note suggested @entity26 grandee @entity11 be probed on trade sanctions against @entity18 , the @entity24 vote on @entity28 , @entity15 ’s remarks in @entity16 about @entity18 shoppers in @entity19 and @entity22 minister @entity21 ’s outburst on cheap migrant labour			0
easy ride ? a question time briefing note contained just two questions for @entity4 's @entity13 , pictured challenged : @entity32 minister @entity32 faced tough questions on the flagship discussion show in contrast , miss @entity13 was simply to be asked two soft questions : whether her party supported a financial bail - out for @entity39 and whether @entity4 agreed with the government ’s handling of the crisis			1
@entity32 justice minister @entity32 was also lined up for more questions than @entity44 , including multiple queries about @entity47 talks and a @entity39 bail - out			0
the @entity49 has seen a copy of the questions and prompts to be sent to mr @entity9			0
the email was seized on by the conservatives who claimed it proved bias in favour of @entity58			2
other guests on the show – screened last week – were the @entity62 columnist @entity61 , the @entity49 ’s @entity63 and former @entity65 adviser and @entity18 commentator @entity66 , who later tweeted that there ‘ should be an alternative question time … with an impartial presenter and all panellists given equal opportunities to speak ’			2
‘ now that the dust has settled i must say that last week ’s was an appalling programme , biased and hijacked by liberals , ’ he added			0
contrast : there was a long line of issues on which to challenge @entity26 grandee @entity11 last night @entity26 mp @entity79 said : ‘ this leaked document confirms what viewers could see in front of them – bias is endemic at the @entity85 viewing public , and licence fee payers , deserve better than this			0
but under the new leadership things seem to be getting worse not better			0
‘ the @entity2 should get a grip and hold a proper inquiry into bias into their flagship programmes			1
’ but a @entity2 spokesman said : ‘ we are satisfied that the programme was fair , balanced and followed our guidelines on impartiality			1
bias : @entity97 admitted the @entity2 naturally attracts liberal - minded people ' @entity1 goes to great lengths to ensure the panel and audience is balanced and reflects a wide range of political views			1
' the programme is a free flowing discussion with @entity9 balancing moderating the debate whilst allowing it to naturally develop			0
’ @entity1 , screened on thursdays on @entity109 , is made by independent production firm @entity110			0
it typically attracts 2.7million viewers although audience figures peaked at more than 7million when it controversially invited the @entity116 ’s @entity115 on the show			0
radio 4 presenter @entity97 admitted earlier this week that there is a ‘ broadly liberal ’ bias at the @entity2			1
but he put this down to the @entity2 hiring the ‘ best and the brightest ’ university graduates where left - wing views were common			2
‘ the @entity2 has tended over the years to be broadly liberal as opposed to broadly conservative for all sorts of perfectly understandable reasons , ’ he told the @entity62			1
‘ the sort of people we ’ve recruited - the best and the brightest - tended to come from universities and backgrounds where they ’re more likely to hold broadly liberal views than conservative			0
’ he also admitted the @entity2 was ‘ grotesquely over managed ’ and that its reporting on issues such as immigration and the @entity137 has not been sufficiently sceptical			2
@entity26 grandee @entity11 @entity32 justice minister @entity32 labour work and pensions spokesman @entity13			1

several points were listed for government but just two for @entity13
@entity4 's work and pensions spokesman given soft options , claim @entity147
*row* comes after @entity151 presenter @entity97 admitted @entity2 has a liberal bias
