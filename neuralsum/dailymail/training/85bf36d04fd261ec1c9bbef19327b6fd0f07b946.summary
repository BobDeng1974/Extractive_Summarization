the @entity1 crisis has provided the latest opportunity for @entity4 hopefuls in tough races to set themselves apart from their beleaguered party head			1
@entity4 sens. @entity7 of @entity8 and @entity9 of @entity10 have both offered differing policies from president @entity12 when it comes to handling the deadly disease , as has @entity16 senate candidate @entity15			1
unlike @entity12 , @entity7 says he supports a temporary ban on travel to the @entity27 from @entity26 president @entity12 , right , is pictured here meeting with @entity33 , then chief of staff to the vice president , and @entity35 , counsel to the vice-president , in the @entity37 , in this may 21 , 2009 photograph			1
@entity12 named @entity33 as his administration 's ebola response coordinator on friday to @entity42 ' annoyance their efforts to show a clear distinction between the way they would respond to the @entity1 outbreak and the president 's actions comes as anger over @entity12 's response to the @entity1 epidemic has escalated among @entity42 , who are are now up in arms over his choice for @entity1 czar			1
lawmakers ' divergence from the president 's approach to managing the health scare mirrors a poll newly released by @entity63 that shows that just 22 percent of likely voters in battleground states have ' a lot of confidence ' that the government ' is doing everything possible to contain the spread of @entity1			1
' another 33 percent said they have no or little confidence in the government 's handling of the situation so far			1
and that survey was conducted before a third @entity1 patient was diagnosed in the @entity27 the poll did not ask what respondents would like to see the government do differently , but a survey conducted by @entity84 and the @entity85 at roughly the same time found that two - thirds of @entity27 support a temporary moratorium on travel to the @entity27 from the three @entity26 countries being savaged by @entity1			1
members of @entity91 have responded in kind , and more than a dozen @entity4 now say they are in favor of travel restrictions			2
they join nearly a hundred of their @entity42 colleagues in demanding that the president do more to stop possible @entity1 carriers from coming to the country			1
' it is clear that the piece - meal approach to contain this outbreak is not enough			2
we need a comprehensive strategy , ' @entity8 ' @entity7 said in a statement on friday			0
' it starts with a travel ban for non-citizens coming to the @entity27 from affected areas and a stepped - up screening process conducted by health professionals for @entity27 returning from @entity26 , ' the incumbent senator , who is locked in a tight race for his seat with @entity8 @entity42 rep. @entity109 , added			1
@entity10 sen. @entity9 speaks at a press conference on wednesday , oct. 15 in @entity117 , @entity10			0
@entity9 said then that a travel ban would n't ' help solve this problem			2
' on friday she said she supports travel restrictions @entity7 's concise support for a travel ban follows an interview he did with @entity124 earlier this month in which he struggled to say whether the @entity12 administration had responded to @entity1 appropriately and aggressively enough			1
' @entity126 ... ' he told network correspondent @entity127			0
' i would say that it 's hard to know because i have n't heard the latest briefing on that			0
' @entity10 's @entity9 also said that unlike the president , she supports a travel ban on friday - just two days after saying at a news conference that it ' would n't help solve this problem ' or ' contain the epidemic that we see happening in @entity26			1
' @entity9 said in a statement on friday , ' i have said for weeks that travel restrictions should be one part of a broad strategy to prevent @entity1 from spreading in the @entity27 and fighting it in @entity26			1
' although stopping the spread of this virus overseas will require a large , coordinated effort with the international community , a temporary travel ban is a prudent step the president can take to protect the @entity27 people , and i believe he should do so immediately			2
' @entity9 's @entity42 opponent in the race , @entity151 , has said he 's in favor of travel restrictions for several weeks			1
the @entity155 jumped on @entity9 's @entity156 on friday and told the @entity157 in an email on monday that ' @entity159 did a full flip - flop			2
' ' she went from calling the proposed ban a " scare tactic " to essentially endorsing the proposed ban that @entity151 put forward weeks ago , ' @entity155 spokesman @entity161 said			0
' @entity159 should quit the games , acknowledge her 180 degree turn , and admit that @entity151 was right all along on this issue			0
' @entity4 candidate for @entity170 @entity15 , right , hugs a supporter at a rally last wednesday before casting her own ballot in early voting at the @entity175 in @entity176 , @entity16			0
@entity15 also came out in favor of a travel ban on friday in @entity16 , @entity4 senate candidate and non-profit head @entity15 sided with her potential colleagues and voiced her support for a travel ban on friday , too			0
' i support a temporary travel ban with the exceptions of our medical and military personnel in those affected areas in @entity26 and i believe that we need to look to our medical practitioners , leaders and scientists and make sure we ’re giving them the resources , ' @entity15 told the @entity85			1
in a similar statement released the same day @entity15 also contended that ' our leaders in @entity195 must provide clear , bipartisan and strong leadership as well as the resources we need to stop the spread of @entity1			1
' the @entity16 @entity199 was involved in a short - lived controversy last week when she refused to tell a tracker for a @entity42 organization whether she voted for @entity12 in 2008 and 2012			1
she confirmed to the @entity85 on friday that she did vote for @entity12 while touting her bipartisan credentials			2
@entity15 's @entity42 opponent in the race , businessman @entity204 , has attacked her as a rubber stamp for @entity12 's policies and released an ad featuring a photo of her and @entity12			1
today she released an ad explaining why she was pictured with the president and that the photo was taken at an event for her non-profit that held in honor of former president @entity216			0
democrats in the @entity22 have also been quick to separate themselves from the ostracized president , whose approval rating has consistently been underwater throughout the election cycle			0
in addition to @entity19 's @entity18 and @entity21 's @entity20 , @entity223 of @entity16 , @entity224 of @entity225 , @entity226 of @entity227 , @entity228 of @entity229 , @entity230 of @entity16 , @entity231 , @entity232 and @entity233 of @entity234 have joined the procession of @entity4 lawmakers lobbying the president to institute a travel ban			2
president @entity12 , center , stands with @entity241 gov. @entity240 , left , and @entity27 sen. @entity242 , during an early voting and campaign rally for @entity245 at @entity246 on sunday			2
@entity245 is one of the few @entity4 up for reelection this year who is willing to tie himself to @entity12 even vulnerable @entity4 have not been nearly as vocal as @entity42 in critiquing the president over @entity1 , however			1
republicans went from upset to outraged with the president on friday after he announced his pick for @entity1 czar			1
after arguing that the @entity22 needed to designate one administration official to direct its response to the heath scare , @entity42 got their wish on friday when @entity12 brought on @entity33 , a former chief of staff to two vice presidents , to act as its @entity1 response coordinator			1
they immediately began disparaging @entity33 's credentials , though , and @entity264 sen. @entity263 led the charge , arguing on friday and again on @entity267 's @entity266 on sunday that @entity33 has no business managing a health crisis			0
' mr. @entity33 is not a doctor			0
he 's not a health care professional			0
he does n't have background in these issues , ' @entity263 said			0
' we do n't need a @entity22 political operative , which is what mr. @entity33 has been			0
' what we need is presidential leadership			0
the person who needs to be on top of this is the president of the @entity27 , ' @entity263 stated			0
@entity283 sen. @entity282 also came out swinging against @entity33 on friday , saying in a statement that the ' @entity27 people can have zero confidence in @entity33 ’s competence to carry out this critical role			0
' ' @entity1 is a health crisis			2
yet the president has appointed as his new ebola ‘ czar ’ a partisan loyalist whose expertise is politics — not health , ' sessions argued			0
' one would think , faced with the prospect of an epidemic , the president would task an expert in epidemiology not an expert in political spin			0
noting that he supports both a travel ban and barring of visas for anyone from countries plagued with @entity1 , @entity282 said , ' the administration continues to refuse to implement even the most commonsense immigration controls to protect public health and public tax dollars			2
' mr. @entity33 ’s appointment , unfortunately , suggests things will get worse — not better			0

at least a dozen democrats in close races this fall have set themselves apart from @entity12 by calling for travel restriction for @entity26
anger over @entity12 's handling of the @entity1 epidemic has escalated among @entity42 as well - they *'re* up in arms over his choice for @entity1 czar
a new poll shows that just 22 percent of likely voters have ' a lot of confidence ' that the government ' is doing everything possible to contain the spread of @entity1 '
