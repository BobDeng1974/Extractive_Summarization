by @entity0 our brains are hardwired to recognise faces , even in inanimate objects , but researchers wanted to reveal how we can become virtually unrecognisable simply by tweaking our features			2
@entity8 - based @entity7 and @entity9 used software to identify 60 facial dimensions before plotting them across more than 1,000 photos donated by people across the globe			1
from the range of images , the team constructed an average face , and then used the dimensions to create what they call an ' @entity22 ' for each contributor			1
try out the module below developers @entity7 and @entity9 used software to identify 60 facial dimensions , which were plotted across more than 1,000 photos donated by people from across the globe			1
for each photo , the team constructed an average face ( pictured ) , before using the dimensions to create what they call an @entity22 the @entity22 is the exact opposite of the face being studied , in terms of shape , size and individual features , said the researchers			1
@entity43 analysis is a statistical face recognition technique			1
it uses @entity46 to calculate a set of @entity48 , or @entity43			0
these @entity43 can be thought of as ' face ingredients '			2
to calibrate the model , the researchers calculated 60 ‘ ingredients ’ of points taken from more than a thousand faces			1
each time a new face is uploaded , it is compared to these points and is created using a linear combination of the individual @entity43			2
typically , a face recognition algorithm would then look for the closest match , but the research is more interested in exploring the individual features and creating what they call an @entity22			1
the relevant ‘ opposite ’ feature is taken from all the photos submitted , and sits at the other end of the scale			1
the @entity70 website , created by mr @entity7 and ms @entity9 , reveals how faces can be altered by using sliders			1

according to the research , the average face ( pictured ) is androgynous			0
it is not race - neutral because the original sample set was biased towards caucasian faces			0
the researchers said they hope to fix this problem in the future as they collect more faces to plot the dimensions , the researchers used @entity43 analysis - a statistical face recognition technique			1
these @entity43 can be thought of as ' face ingredients '			0
to calibrate the model , the researchers calculated 60 ' ingredients ' taken from random faces ( pictured ) initially , the researchers explored the concept of face continuum , or how unique a person ’s face is			1
‘ from the face continuum emerged the notion of the @entity22 , ' said mr @entity7			1
‘ the @entity22 program is face recognition turned upside - down			1
' after looking at your image , it creates a face as different from yours as possible			0
it might change your gender , your age , your expression			0
' this means prominent features in the reconstructed faces , with high weighting , would be equally prominent , though opposite , in the anti face			2
each time a new face is uploaded , it is compared to these points and is created using a linear combination of the individual @entity43			2
sliders along the side of each image ( pictured ) can be used to change the features across each of these 60 points to see the face change from male to female , for example ' the @entity22 program is face recognition turned upside - down			1
' after looking at your image , it creates a face as different from yours as possible			0
' this means prominent features ( highlighted in shadows pictured ) would be equally prominent , though opposite , in the anti face ‘ the terms @entity157 and @entity159 are often used interchangeably but to be precise , @entity157 picks out faces from an image , whereas @entity159 takes a new image of a face and matches it with one it has previously seen , ’ continued mr @entity7			2
‘ our research into multi-dimensional visual spaces draws upon algorithms used in @entity159			0
’ ‘ [ with the average face ] , all the coordinates are zero			0
this face resides exactly in the middle of the face cloud			0
’ according to the research , the average face is androgynous			0
it is not race - neutral because the original sample set was biased towards caucasian faces			0
the researchers said they hope to fix this problem in the future as they collect more faces			0
photos can be submitted via @entity7 's @entity185 project page .			0

researchers used analysis software to identify 60 facial dimensions
these dimensions were *mapped* out using more than 1,000 photos
for each photo , the team created what they call an ' @entity22 '
this is the exact opposite of the face in the photo that is being studied
the relevant ' opposite ' feature sits at the other end of the scale
*synthetic* face site reveals how this face can be altered by using sliders
