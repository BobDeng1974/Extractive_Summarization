a family who were planning a dream trip to @entity2 , @entity3 , were forced to scrap their holiday after @entity7 border officials got confused about a date			1
@entity9 and @entity10 hoped to take their son @entity11 on the family trip after returning form a previous @entity2 holiday which they loved			1
but when they booked the break with @entity17 and applied for new online visas known as @entity19 ( @entity20 ) , their applications were rejected			2
@entity9 and @entity10 , with their son @entity11 , who was due to accompany them on their trip to @entity2 , @entity3			1
@entity7 border control rejected the family 's request on the grounds that @entity10 , 50 , had ' overstayed ' on her previous holiday			1
when the family phoned the @entity33 and @entity32 they were told a computer had recorded she had overstayed for three months			1
they eventually realised it had confused the different @entity37 and @entity7 date formats and recorded her departure date as 11/8 - november 8 instead of 8/11 - august 11			1
the family complained to @entity17 but were told nothing could be done and they would not be issued with new @entity42 and had to cancel the holiday			1
after a two year compensation battle they have finally received vouchers from @entity17 to the £ 3,000 value of the flights they lost			2
but @entity10 and civil engineer @entity9 , 52 , say they are still £ 500 out of pocket because they have not been reimbursed for the accommodation bill			1
beauty therapist @entity10 said : ' with everybody we contacted to try and fix it we came across an attitude of ' it 's your problem not ours '			1
' we lost all the money on the flights and accommodation and spent hours of our own time sending emails and making calls without getting anywhere			0
' what i ca n't believe is how long it took us to prove to people what date i travelled back			0
it is a black and white thing really and they did n't believe me			0
' it is unbelievable really that we were able to get on a flight out of @entity7 without us even being recorded			2
' she added : ' it is not really @entity17 's fault but they did n't deal with the situation quickly and we lost our holiday			2
' they are offering us free flights but it has cost us money and caused us a lot of unnecessary stress			0
' they were n't interested in sorting out the problem despite it being on their flight using a company they contracted			0
' the @entity10 family had previously been to @entity3 and wanted to return to @entity2 with their youngest son as they had enjoyed it so much @entity9 and @entity10 took all their children - @entity102 , 25 , @entity103 , 23 , and @entity11 , 15 - to @entity2 , @entity104 in 2012 and hoped to go back with @entity11 the following summer			1
they later found that hundreds of people had been affected by the glitch with @entity107 - used by @entity33 and @entity32 - that occurred around october 2013			0
@entity10 claims that @entity107 notified the @entity108 but the authorities refused to act on it for almost a year			2
she added : ' hundreds of other people were affected and we do n't know why my husband and son did n't have the same problem			0
' i think when it got to august 13th somebody must have realised there were n't 13 months in a year			0
' but @entity10 , from @entity120 , @entity121			2
added that they only managed to achieve justice after an investigation by the @entity125 @entity127 programme			0
@entity17 said a third - party company was responsible for the error			0
@entity17 has now paid out for the lost flights , but the @entity132 claim they are still out of pocket for the cancelled accommodation due to the mix - up a spokesman said : ' we sympathise with the @entity10 family and understand their frustration and disappointment at not being able to travel to @entity3			1
' we did everything that we could to support the family			0
' however , as @entity17 has no influence over the operations of , or the decisions made by , the @entity108 agency and the local departure control system provider , there was unfortunately nothing that we could do to enable the family to travel			2
' he added : ' whilst our terms and conditions do state that @entity17 is unable to provide compensation for unused flights that result from the necessary documentation and authority for travel not being in place , and the original issue was unconnected to @entity17 , we believe it is unfair that the @entity10 family is out of pocket as a result of an error at a third - party company			1
' we have therefore offered them flights to @entity3 up to the value of the original flights purchased as a gesture of goodwill			0
' we would like to reassure customers that this was an extremely rare situation and we understand the system issue has been resolved by the local departure control system provider			0

@entity9 and @entity10 booked family trip after returning from @entity178 holiday
@entity7 border control claimed @entity10 overstayed her previous visa
confusion arose over different way @entity7 and @entity37 write out dates
@entity187 forced to cancel holiday and chase compensation for two years
