by @entity0 for @entity1 follow @ @ @entity2 it 's been a difficult year for @entity4			2
a poor first season at @entity6 was followed by a dismal @entity8 showing as his @entity10 side ended their home tournament in disgrace			0
but there have been signs this season , and particularly on thursday night , that the @entity16 may be beginning to turn things around			0
the midfielder scored one goal and made another as @entity6 easily beat @entity21 to qualify for the @entity22			0
here is @entity25 's verdict on the performances of the players : making sure : @entity4 slides home @entity6 ' second goal , ending the tie as a contest @entity32 - had very little to do but was on hand when needed - 7 @entity34 forward running which led to @entity6 's early penalty - 7.5 big blow : @entity34 collides with @entity38 in the @entity21 goal to win @entity6 a penalty arrival : @entity43 's penalty was saved by @entity44 with his very first touch of the game @entity47 and dependable performance but did n't have too much to do - 7 @entity50 assured performance from the back , the @entity49 was always looking to give the ball to the midfield to start the next attack - 7 @entity55 - settling in well at hisnew club and could have made it four late on with rasping drive which was well saved - 7 strong : @entity59 dominated the centre of the park as @entity6 looked comfortable throughout @entity59 - kept possession well and was always looking to receive the ball from team - mates - 7 @entity65 - knitted together much of @entity6 's good play and worked well alongside fellow @entity16 @entity4 - 7.5 @entity4 - some lovely touches and was on hand to slide the ball through to @entity43 for the opener before doubling @entity6 's advantage himself - 8 hard work : @entity4 looked good going forward but also did his fair share of work defensively @entity75 - went close to scoring a delightful chip early in the second half and put in a good shift for his side - 7 @entity83 - @entity82 problems down the wing and did n't stop running			1
7.5 three - sy does it : @entity83 celebrates scoring @entity6 's third goal from the penalty spot @entity43 - lead the line well and redeemed his penalty miss with a well - taken goal - 7.5 relentless : despite his early penalty miss @entity43 recovered to score the first goal of the night			1

@entity4 makes it 2 - 0 early in second half
@entity83 scores penalty to wrap up the tie 5 - 1 on *aggregate*
