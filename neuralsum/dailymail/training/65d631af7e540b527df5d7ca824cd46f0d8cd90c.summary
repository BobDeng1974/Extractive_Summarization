armed : mr @entity14 went on night raids with police in @entity19			1

' i followed the night patrols and raids of the anti-gang police unit in @entity19 ' ' no one can leave the gang , ' a local policeman told the @entity15 photographer			1
' once you get to the gang , it is a commitment to the end of your life ' bloodthirsty : the murder rate in @entity19 dropped after a truce between the rival gangs in 2012 , but many residents say crime continues unabated ' they reminded me of the ancient tribe warriors , ' he said			2
' i followed the night patrols and raids of the anti-gang @entity131 unit in @entity19 , a troop that fights directly the major street gangs , the @entity11 and @entity13			1
' mr @entity14 said he has not seen many signs of positive change			2
' although i wish i could say the things are getting better in @entity3 , especially issues related to gangs and violence , i can not say that , ' he said			1
' from my point of view , violence is still the main issues in people 's daily lives			0
' the photojournalist found one incident particularly memorable			0
' in 2011 i was shooting in a gang neighbourhood , ' he said			0
' i met a young man on the street , a @entity151 18 gang member , with his face completely tattooed			2
he was barely 18 or 20 years old			0
holding a bible in his hand , he was going to the local church for the mass. remains : an abandoned apartment used by gang members as a refuge which was stumbled upon by police officers on a night raid in the capital @entity19 ' after three years , i found myself in the same neighbourhood where i had met the tattooed man , ' the photographer said			1
' i found a local policeman and asked about the tattoed man			0
a year ago he was killed by people from his gang			2
he knew too much , " the cop just shrugged ' violence : the @entity11 and @entity151 18 gangs agreed a truce in 2012 which reportedly involved the government			1
but some details still remain a secret ' i started to work on several themes there , ' the photographer said			0

' ' but a local cop with whom i shared my experience told me : " no one can leave the gang ... once you get to the gang , it is a commitment to the end of your life			2
" ' ' after three years , i found myself in the same neighbourhood where i had met the tattooed man			2

' marked : the gangs show their territory by leaving graffiti on walls			0
the violence has continued for many years despite the efforts of police and the government colourful : the neighbourhoods are lively , but they are also plagued by crime			0
some wealthy people hire private security and drive bulletproof cars surprisingly to many , initial reports suggested the truce had an effect			0
the crime rate dropped some 70 per cent			0
but not all citizens of @entity19 are in agreement reading his rights : a woman looks on as specialist police handcuff a suspected gang member in the night - keeping their weapons at the ready as he lies on the floor home : but mr @entity14 said there were positive moments : ' eating hot " pupusas " , traditional @entity3 handmade corn tortillas , during the long chilly nights ' and there were enjoyable times too , he said - ' maybe eating hot " pupusas " , traditional @entity3 handmade corn tortillas , while following the policemen on the patrol during the long chilly nights			1
' mr @entity14 is one of many angry about the 2012 truce , saying he can not judge whether it was effective as the conditions were never fully revealed to the public			2
' i witnessed what ordinary @entity3 people say and according to them , the truce is a cheat and it does not work , ' he said			2
' the main reason for their disillusion seems to be the fact that the gangs have never stopped their criminal activities , including extortions , distribution of drugs and kidnappings			0
' in april officials said the murder rate , which dropped from 14 to five per day after the truce , had risen to nine per day since january			0
members of the @entity11 gang have orders to take revenge against police and soldiers who wound or kill one of their own , officials added			1
