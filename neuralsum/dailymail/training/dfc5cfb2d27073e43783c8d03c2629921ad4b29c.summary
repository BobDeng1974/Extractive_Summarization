it reads almost like a long - lost script of an @entity3 movie			0
but a @entity5 archaeologist has claimed to have cracked the secret to a trove of @entity9 gold - through a sheet of music he claims is a ' coded treasure map '			1
@entity14 , 51 , has performed three digs for the loot near @entity17 , on the @entity19 border but has so far come up with nothing			1
@entity21 marks the score : @entity14 , 51 , has performed three unsuccessful digs for the loot in the hills near @entity17 ( pictured ) , on the @entity19 border , but has vowed to continue , convinced a sheet of music holds the key he has based his searches on a single score of recently uncovered music called ' @entity31 ' and penned by classical composer @entity32 , who died in 1952			1
he believes that a lyric in the music that reads ' @entity34 die @entity35 , ' or ' where @entity36 plucks strings , ' in fact refers to @entity17 and one - time resident @entity39 , the town 's fabled violin maker			1
final orders : @entity43 is said to have ordered his private secretary , @entity44 ( right ) , to bury a hoard of ill - gotten bullion somewhere in the @entity48 hills during the last days of the @entity9 golden boy : @entity44 ( right ) was then instructed to imbed a series of letters , figures and runes on the sheet music that would , when deciphered , lend the coordinates of the treasure he also believes the music contains a diagram of ' train tracks ' that once ran through @entity17 in the 1940s , and that the score 's final sentence , ' @entity62 der @entity61 , ' which means ' end the dance ' suggests the gold is at the railway 's buffer stops			1
it is well - known that the @entity71 hid much of the gold , silver and jewels plundered during their conquests			2
the regime executed a policy of looting the assets of its victims to finance the war , collecting the looted assets in top - secret central depositories			0
much of it included valuables confiscated from prisoners arriving at concentration camps before it was melted down into bullion			0
but as the war drew to a close , they desperately tried to ' make it disappear ' instead of letting it fall into allied hands			0
some has been found in caves or vaults ( pictured ) but much of it still remains unaccounted for			0
some of it is even believed to have been laundered into @entity102 banks in 1945			0
according to @entity103 , @entity43 ordered his private secretary , @entity44 , to bury a hoard of ill - gotten bullion somewhere in the @entity48 hills during the last days of the @entity9			1
@entity44 was then instructed to imbed a series of letters , figures and runes on the sheet music that would , when deciphered , lend the coordinates of the treasure			1
the score was then supposed to be couriered to @entity115			2
some 50 years later , @entity5 journalist @entity117 came across the document and went on to perform a series of abortive digs			0
but finally , with no gold in sight , he decided to make the supposed map public			2
@entity14 has found pockets of ' anomalous ' metals , but is yet to find anything of real value			1
he is convinced , however , that his hunt will not be in vain and is trying to raise the funds for another dig. ' it 's like a treasure map that ca n't be deciphered , ' @entity132 , a @entity133 historian , told @entity136			2
' it could be a treasure chest			0
but it could just be a manhole cover			0

@entity14 , 51 , believes nazis buried gold near @entity17 , in @entity19
he claims the exact spot of the hidden treasure is hidden in music score
the music is called ' @entity31 ' by composer @entity32
it is thought @entity43 made secretary bury treasure and hide *location* in music
