by @entity0 for the @entity1 @entity3 ’s slide from global grocery champion to chain store chump has been so rapid it takes the breath away			1
it was perhaps understandable that it would go through a difficult transition after the brilliant @entity10 departed in 2011			0
a more pedestrian chief executive , @entity11 , was fired in july after three miserable years in the job			0
but the problems the company revealed yesterday are of an entirely different order			0
@entity3 accounts for £ 1 in every £ 8 spent in @entity17 shops but has now seen its share price drop by 40 per cent it ’s deeply shocking to discover that @entity17 ’s largest retailer has been rigging its profit figures to make them look better			1
in the context of @entity3 – whose profits , before tax , last year totalled £ 2.8billion – a mistake of £ 250million may not appear that overwhelming			1
the company still dominates @entity17 grocery , with 28.2 per cent of the total market , and has operations stretching from @entity32 to @entity33			1
but we must remember that the missing quarter of a billion is more than many high street retail chains earn in a full year			0
and @entity3 is a relatively uncomplicated enterprise – one that is able to add up the cash passing through its tills every day			1
it seems astonishing that the leading accountancy firm @entity43 , which has audited @entity3 ’s accounts for more than three decades , could have allowed an error on this scale to happen on its watch			1
indeed , the choice of a top ‘ magic circle ’ law firm @entity49 , along with new accountants @entity51 , to conduct a probe into the affair suggests that it goes deeper than a simple accounting mistake			2
so what on earth has gone on ? it was amid a slumping share price – and management chaos – that @entity3 ’s latest chief executive @entity60 arrived at the company from consumer goods giant @entity63 on september 1			1
he discovered that the previous team , reporting to the office of @entity66 - driving @entity11 , was under enormous pressure from investors to buff up the company ’s performance – and preserve their jobs and bonuses			0
to this end , they allegedly manipulated the published figures by counting profits before they had been rung up at the tills			0
at the same time , they allegedly under - reported the costs of goods from suppliers			0
this is the kind of shoddy practice one might expect from struggling businesses way down the corporate pecking order			0
that it should come at one of @entity17 ’s most respected @entity90 companies is astounding			1
already , four top - level executives – including @entity17 managing director @entity92 – have been suspended			1
and before you think this is merely a problem for a very large and rich company , consider that everyone in the country with a company pension fund , or an insurance policy , or a share @entity100 , is a loser because some of their money will automatically be invested in @entity3			1
the group ’s shares are now down 40 per cent this year , with £ 2billion wiped off in latest trading			1
@entity3 has long represented a mass of contradictions			1
it has been a smart innovator , moving back into small neighbourhood stores before its competitors , exploiting online shopping , and moving into new areas such as banking , and even upmarket coffee shops			0
but at the same time it is reviled by suppliers who accuse it of bullying practices and slow payment of invoices			0
it ’s also hated by the green lobby for ‘ concreting ’ over swathes of @entity17 , and accused of hoarding valuable land and property suitable for housing			1
the first indications of fundamental problems came in january 2012			0
mr @entity11 , less than a year into the role of chief executive , warned profits would fail to meet expectations for the first time in 19 years			0
in april of the same year he announced a £ 1billion revival plan directed at improving the stores that were described by some consumers as cold , industrial and unappealing in appearance , and offering poor customer service			2
but @entity3 was also a victim of cultural change sweeping through high streets , shopping centres and malls			1
as a mid-market retailer , it found itself caught in a vice between the no - frills retailers at the discount end of the market , and the rising strength of @entity152 and @entity153 among the more aspirational shoppers			2
at the same time , the company ’s huge investment in out - of - town @entity3 superstores was undermined by the digital revolution which ushered in @entity160 and price comparison websites			1
@entity3 also found itself in retreat in @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			2
these were challenges enough without a £ 250million gap in profits , which will mean many people will find it hard to trust the group for some time			1
by holding its own inquiry , the @entity3 board – headed by former @entity174 chief @entity173 – will hope to keep official investigators at bay and deal with any issues internally			2
that may be very difficult given the importance of the company and the threat to the reputation of @entity17 business			1
and , while the public will continue to shop in its stores , long - suffering suppliers , investors and regulators may be much less forgiving			0
@entity3 said today that the overstatement of its half - year profits by £ 250million was ' principally due to the accelerated recognition of commercial income and delayed accrual of costs '			1
this could mean that the reporting of any costs @entity3 incurred during the first half of the financial year was been pushed back into the second half , and profits from the second put forward			2
in regard to supermarkets , commercial income can be the revenue the chain receives from the companies which supply its products , who compete for the prime spots on the supermarket 's shelves			0
some of these firms will pay @entity3 a listing fee in order for their products to be stocked in stores			2
they will also shell out in order to bag a prime shelf location or for any promotions or product discounts involving their goods , which often lead to increased sales for the supplier			0
the supplier may offer a discount on items sold through the supermarket , and although some brands may give an incentive or payment , known as a rebate , to the store upfront , others would only do so if it reaches a sales target			0
halfway through the financial year , supermarkets must predict how much they expect rebates will be worth over the course of the year , but this estimation requires some guess work by managers over money yet to be received			0
@entity249 ’s @entity248 said the revelation should be interpreted as a ' sign of distress '			0
' @entity3 has essentially tried to recognise revenue too early and delay the recording of costs until a later date , ' he said			2
' accounting is not a hard science and some of this behaviour is acceptable , within limits			0
what @entity3 appear to have done is push the boat out a bit too far , ending up with revenue that had n't really been earned yet and costs that probably should have been booked earlier			2

supermarket giant has admitted *inflating* its finance accounts by £ 250million
@entity3 has seen £ 2billion wiped off market value and shares drop 40 per cent
' four senior executives ' among those also suspended while probe occurs
*multi-channel* director @entity276 has *stepped* in to run the @entity17 business
