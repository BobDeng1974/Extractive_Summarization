by @entity0 at least three miners have been killed and up to 30 are missing after an illegal gold mine collapsed in southwest @entity3			1
the pit , in a rural area near @entity6 , caved in at around midnight last night after a tunnel wall buckled , trapping workers underground			1
but as dawn broke this morning , hopes of finding survivors were beginning to fade after three bodies were pulled from the rubble			1
so far , three injured miners have been rescued			0
incredibly , initial rescue efforts were hampered because the owners of the mine , rather than use their own equipment to try and rescue the missing , hid it to keep it from being seized because they had no permit , mining and energy minister @entity61 said			2
' we arrived at the scene and managed to remove three bodies , ' said @entity64 , head of the firefighters in the @entity3 's @entity66 , where the disaster took place			1
but @entity64 could offer little hope for those who were not pulled to safety immediately after the cave - in , saying that some of the workers were buried under 20 meters ( 60 feet ) of earth			1
' it is impossible that anyone could have survived , ' @entity64 said			0
' there is too much earth and rocks and mud			0
' rescue workers were waiting for the heavy machinery to remove enough mud to send in sniffer dogs			0
but they said lots of earth still had to be shifted before this would be possible			0
big business : @entity3 produces some 66 metric tons of gold per year , equating to $ 33billion in exports rising demand : the past five years have seen revenue from gold exports increase 10-fold , according to government data the rescue effort has gripped the surrounding communities in the rural region joint effort : police , troops , civil defense and the @entity103 were aiding in rescue efforts to the rescue : a member of the @entity103 and his dog descend towards the site @entity110 mining : mining accidents are common in @entity3 , especially at wildcat mines in poverty - stricken areas dominated by criminal gangs with little state presence to make matters worse , the number of missing could rise because so far the list is based on reports from relatives and there are concerns others may not yet have come forward			1
@entity3 has been luring gold prospectors since @entity126 conquistadors pursued the mythical city of @entity128			1
after a decline in recent decades , the industry has surged over the past five years , with exports now totalling around $ 33billion annually			0
it has become so lucrative that paramilitary guerrillas and drug gangs ( known as ' @entity135 ' ) are increasingly turning to illegal gold mining to fund their terrorist acts			1
fuelled by the government 's crackdown on the drugs trade and a steady increase in metals prices in recent years , this new trend has seen a fivefold jump in gold prices over the last decade			0
cocaine is no longer a sufficient source of funding for 8,000 - member @entity149 ( pictured on a training exercise ) because distribution - the most lucrative side of the cocaine market - is now largely controlled by @entity155 cartels			0
it is , therefore , easier for rebel bands and criminal gangs to operate an illegal mine than a coca field			2
foreign and local groups fighting for the rights of the region 's indigenous inhabitants estimate that there are as many as 4,000 illegal miners working in the area near the borders with @entity3 and @entity169			1
@entity170 , 50 , whose nephew was among the missing , said she had given up hope			0
' not even @entity174 knows where they are , ' she said			0
cauca province gov. @entity177 said illegal miners use machinery to open huge holes to extract gold , often without providing the necessary structural support			2
police , troops , civil defense and the @entity103 were aiding in rescue efforts in the mine , which is about 190 miles southwest of @entity189 , the capital			1
mining accidents are common in @entity3 , especially at wildcat mines in poverty - stricken areas dominated by criminal gangs with little state presence			1
@entity3 has been blighted by a string of mining disasters , sparking calls for an overhaul of safety laws and a crackdown on illegal quarries			1
less than a week ago , four people were killed inhaling noxious gases following an explosion at a mine in @entity207 province that continued to operate in defiance of an order to close			0
@entity210 , vice president of corporate affairs at the company @entity211 , told @entity212 that the explosion was caused by an industrial material popularly called ' crazy dust , ' which generates highly toxic gases and has already claimed several lives in the gold mining zone			2
last year , nine miners died after floods trapped them in an underground coal mine in northern @entity3 when a subterranean water deposit ruptured and inundated the shaft 200 metres underground			2
in a region rich in gold , @entity223 has seen a rise in wildcat mines , accused of tearing down rainforests and polluting rivers with tonnes of toxic mercury , which they use to separate gold from ore			1
@entity3 has more than 14,000 mines , more than half of which operate without proper permits , officials said			1
in @entity3 there are fears that left - wing guerrillas and former paramilitaries are profiting from illegal mining			1
@entity3 has been luring gold prospectors since @entity126 conquistadors pursued the mythical city of @entity128			2
in the 19th century , the country was among the world ’s largest producers of gold , thanks to its abundant supply			0
but decades of gang warfare and administrational disarray slipped the country down the global rankings			0
however , the past five years have seen revenue from gold exports increase 10-fold , according to government data			0
@entity3 produces some 66 metric tons of gold per year , equating to $ 33billion in exports			2
its two largest producers are @entity264 ( @entity265 ) , based in @entity266 , and @entity267 ( @entity268 ) , based in @entity269			0
they account for 10 to 15 per cent of the country ’s output			0
the rest comes from smaller legal endeavours , mining firms that have worked the same area for generations tax free and without permits and those with links to criminal or rebel groups , including the @entity149 , or @entity149			0
polluting : in a region rich in gold , @entity223 has seen a rise in wildcat mines , accused of tearing down rainforests and polluting rivers with tonnes of toxic mercury , which they use to separate gold from ore unregulated : @entity3 has more than 14,000 mines , more than half of which operate without proper permits guerrilla control : in @entity3 there are fears that left - wing guerrillas and former paramilitaries are profiting from illegal mining in darkness : rescue workers remove sludge during the rescue last night in @entity310 province , in @entity3 ’s eastern @entity308 jungle , unlicensed miners use makeshift barges to pan for gold from along the @entity313			1
colonel @entity314 , acting director of the country ’s rural police division , has said that current profits from illegal gold mining are five times greater than returns from cocaine for rebels groups operating in @entity3			1
' a kilogram of cocaine can sell for about 2,570 in the @entity3 jungle , while a kilogram of gold can fetch 19 times that , or similar to global market prices , ' he said			2
@entity211 has become @entity3 ’s main export after oil and coal .			0

the pit collapsed in a rural area near @entity6 , 190 - miles from @entity3 capital @entity189
rescuers have pulled three bodies from rubble as hopes fade for survivors who may have been buried alive
of 14,000 gold mines in @entity3 , around half are *believed* to be illegal in which some 4,000 workers mine for gangs
they *'re* accused of *destroying* rainforests and polluting rivers with toxic mercury , used to separate gold from ore
fears that left - wing guerrillas and *ex-paramilitaries* are behind illegal mining , using gains to fund terrorism
