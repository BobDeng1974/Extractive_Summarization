the prime minister makes a lot of his special relationship with @entity4 - but it seems the president who calls him ' bro ' does n't feel the same way			1
mr @entity4 is following the wrong @entity8 on @entity9 - a computer game - lover from @entity11 who tweets about @entity13 and @entity14			1
while @ @entity15 enjoys the attention of the @entity18 premier , @entity20 counterpart @ @entity21 has been left high and dry by the most powerful man in the world			2
instead he follows an @entity11 movie fan spot the difference : prime minister @entity8 ... and a computer game - lover from @entity11 in the @entity18 the unequal relationship was revealed with the help of online tool @entity36 , which analyses who follows who on the social networking site			1
the prime minister follows just 382 carefully - picked people , and the @entity18 president is among them			1
but mr @entity4 does not follow him back , despite being signed up for the updates of 645,000 people			1
instead he follows @ @entity15 , an internet user from @entity11 who wrote when the prime minister joined @entity9 in 2012 : ' i am not the prime minister			0
' i am a dude from @entity18 , who is more awesome than the prime minister			0
' he has 1,143 followers compared to the @entity45 's 897,000 - though they do include @entity52			2
to any careful eye it 'd be obvious that he is n't one of the leaders of the free world			0
his tweets include : ' any @entity11 area friends who might be available tomorrow to help unload a moving van into a storage unit ? ' popular : mr @entity4 is one of the most followed people on @entity9 , and follows 645,000 people back awkward : @ @entity4 follows @entity11 computer game - lover @ davidcameron - but not the prime minister of the @entity20 @ @entity21			1
the prime minister does , however , return the favour another declared : ' @entity69			2
' on january 8 , he wrote : ' i have @entity73 * * * * * * glasses of wine and suddenly i have a case of the hiccups that is so bad i will probably pull a muscle			0
' and on december 21 , his message to the world was : ' just cried while watching @entity81			0
' the closest he has ever come to enacting a new law has been to suggest ' banning the practice of packing books into cardboard boxes ' while he was moving house			0
that 's all without mentioning his profile picture is a still from @entity92 the president is not the only @entity9 user who has mistaken @entity11 's @entity8 for the real thing - he receives a daily tide of abuse from people unhappy about government policy			2
definitely not @entity20 's @entity8 : the @entity11 tweeter 's updates are decidedly @entity102 sometimes he replies , telling one person who said ' please shut up @ davidcameron ' : ' nope '			0
he gave the same response to another user who wrote : ' can @ davidcameron confirm whether 24hrs in @entity107 is a @entity109 documentary or @entity111 policy ? ' there is a simple explanation for the social media faux pas first spotted by @entity115			0
the @entity18 president no longer runs his own @entity9 account			1
despite having @entity9 's blue ' certified ' tick , it is run by campaigners for the @entity121			0
and instead of following other users manually , like the prime minister does , it ' auto - follows ' people who have decided to follow the president			1
not everyone is auto - followed , and the account goes through long periods without following people back			2
but that did n't stop the news prompting amusement on @entity9			0
one @entity18 user wrote of @entity4 : ' ca n't he do anything right ? ' abuse : the @entity11 @entity8 is frequently mistaken for the prime minister and replies to his critics special relationship : the prime minister and the president rubbing shoulders in the @entity144 last week			1

@entity45 follows 382 carefully - picked people , including the @entity18 president
but @entity4 has n't returned the favour - despite following 645,000 people
instead he follows a computer game - loving @entity14 fan from @entity11
tweets include crying at @entity156 and ' @entity69 . someone cook me foooood '
president auto - follows on his account , which is run by campaigners
