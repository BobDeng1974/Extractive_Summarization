giant deer that once roamed the prehistoric @entity1 were thought to have been wiped out towards the end of the @entity3			1
but scientists have discovered that @entity6 elk lived on in @entity7 for around 2,000 years after it was presumed they had gone extinct			1
tests on bones found scattered across the frozen @entity12 wilderness are rewriting the evolutionary history of the animal , which stood seven feet ( two metres ) tall and had majestic antlers with a 10 foot ( three - metre ) span			1
scientists have discovered that the @entity6 elk lived on in @entity7 for around 2,000 years after it was presumed to have become extinct			1
this image shows the skull of the large moose - like animal it had been assumed previously the moose - like animal , which was prevalent in @entity6 and parts of continental @entity24 , was wiped out around 10,300 years ago along with the likes of sabre - tooth cats and giant sloths			1
but tests carried out on remains have concluded that not only did the species travel to the other side of the world , but also survived for at least another two millennia			0
analysis of bones unearthed in @entity7 revealed they are just 8,800 years old and date back to about @entity36			1
dr @entity38 , a senior researcher at the @entity39 in @entity7 , said the discovery will ‘ significantly update ’ theories on the deer 's extinction , @entity37 reported			2
it had been assumed previously the moose - like animal ( illustrated ) , which was prevalent in @entity6 and parts of continental @entity24 , was wiped out around 10,300 years ago along with sabre - tooth cats and giant sloths it was thought that the last habitat of the species was in western and north @entity24 , including the @entity1 and @entity50 , 10,300 years ago ( marked on the map at 1 ) , but new analysis has shown that another population lived on in @entity7 between 8,800 and 7,900 years ago ( marked at 3 ) ‘ previously we knew that the population of the giant deer was being dramatically reduced from about 12,000 years ago , ’ he said			1
‘ it was also known that the last habitat of the species in western and north @entity24 , including the @entity1 and @entity50 , was about 10,300 years ago			2
‘ but now we have shown that there were at least two habitats : the @entity24 and @entity62			0
’ a distant relative of the modern - day fallow deer , the @entity6 elk was a giant animal that lived solely on vegetation			1
tests on bones found scattered across the frozen @entity12 wilderness are re-writing the evolutionary history of the animal , which stood seven feet ( two metres ) tall and had majestic antlers with a 10 foot ( three metre ) span			1
a skeleton is shown left and diagram illustrating its height , right existence of @entity6 elks first became apparent in the 17th and 18th centuries when scientists realised that fossilised specimens did not belong to any living creature on @entity83			2
an antler from a giant deer is shown neither an elk nor exclusive to @entity6 , it was given its name because the most well - preserved fossils were located in peat bogs in the country			1
their existence first became apparent in the 17th and 18th centuries when scientists realised that fossilised specimens did not belong to any living creature on @entity83			0
various studies concluded they became prevalent in @entity24 and parts of @entity99 and @entity100			0
a set of remains found in 1886 near @entity103 , in the @entity105 region of @entity12 , were analysed in 2004 by dr @entity106 , who is now at @entity107			0
his team said they believed they dated back 7,500 years			0
that theory has now been confirmed by new tests on other bones and fossils uncovered across @entity7 over the past 15 years			1
a distant relative of the modern - day fallow deer , the @entity6 elk was a giant animal that lived solely on vegetation			1
a fossil of its upper jaw bone is shown the next step for the scientists in @entity12 is to compile data on every set of giant deer remains found in @entity7 to see if that can provide further clues to the animal 's evolution			1
a skeleton is shown among the remains examined as part of the new research were fragments of antlers discovered in @entity136 , in @entity7 , and a jaw complete with teeth in a burial ground called @entity140 6 in the same region			2
both sets were found to be between 8,800 and 8,900 years old			2
it means the @entity6 elk , presumed to have become extinct in @entity24 , was alive and well in @entity7 thousands of years later			1
the findings are published in the april edition of the journal , @entity148			0
the next step for the scientists in @entity12 is to compile data on every set of giant deer remains found in @entity7 to see if that can provide further clues to the animal 's evolution			2
dr @entity38 said : ‘ we do not know if the @entity62 habitat was continuous or consisted of two separate sub-habitats : one in central @entity7 and the @entity159 , and a second one in the middle course of the @entity161			2
‘ we need somehow to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about the giant deer habitat and its migration and so on			0
’ a huge step towards recreating the woolly mammoth has been taken by scientists who inserted more than a dozen of its genes into the live dna of an elephant			0
researchers studied the structure of @entity172 from mammoths preserved in the @entity177 to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal ’s genes			0
these were then integrated by experts at @entity182 in @entity183 into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal dna			0
recreation : researchers studied the structure of @entity172 from woolly mammoths ( file illustration ) preserved in the @entity177 to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal ’s genes a new method known as ' @entity191 ' - helping scientists make accurate changes to @entity172 - was used by genetics professor @entity194 , who replaced parts of elephant dna with the mammoth genes			0
he said : ‘ we prioritised genes associated with cold resistance including hairiness , ear size , subcutaneous fat and , especially , haemoglobin ( the protein that carries oxygen around the body )			0
’ ‘ de-extinction ’ enthusiast mr @entity194 , who was speaking to the @entity209 science editor @entity208 , added : ‘ we now have functioning elephant cells with mammoth @entity172 in them			0

@entity6 elk were thought to have been wiped out during the @entity3
they were five ft ( *2metres* ) tall and had antlers with a 10 ft ( 3 metre ) span
fossils reveal they lived on in @entity7 for around 2,000 years afterwards
bones studied were found in various locations in western @entity7
