by @entity0 for @entity1 the customer is always right			0
so much so that @entity4 has let a seven - year - old boy redesign its brown sauce label - because it 's ' too boring '			1
@entity7 wrote to the supermarket complaining about the drab design , and included his own suggestion			1
now , @entity7 's label - which features a hand - drawn picture of a full @entity26 breakfast - has gone on sale nationwide			1
his mother @entity28 , 38 , said it was her father that encouraged @entity7 to get in touch with the supermarket			2
but family in @entity35 , @entity36 , never expected to get a response			0
the mother - of - two said : ' @entity7 wrote in his letter that he did n't really know what was on the bottle , he said his mummy thought he was really good at drawing and he 'd happily draw them a new label if they wanted			1
surprise : he wrote a letter to @entity4 managing director @entity49 and was astounded to receive a reply ' a few weeks later he received a letter back thanking him for his comments and agreeing to take him up on his offer to design a new label			1
' we did n't really expect @entity7 to get a response i think his dad and i were more shocked than @entity7			2
' @entity7 was really surprised and really excited as he was only six at the time , he spent almost a week perfecting his design , he drew three suggestions one with a picture of a bacon sandwich another with a picture of fried eggs on toast and another with a fried breakfast			1
dear @entity49 , i am writing as the other morning i had @entity4 essential @entity68 with my bacon sandwiches			2

mummy says i am good at drawing so if you would like me to draw a new picture for the label i would be happy to			0
kind regards , @entity7 , aged 6			2
' now the label is on the shelf it looks great and i think @entity4 have really done themselves proud it proves they listen to their customers no matter how young they are			0
' @entity7 is not the only one to take the supermarkets to task - and come out victorious			1
in 2012 , three - year - old @entity87 pointed out that so - called ' tiger bread ' bears no resemblance to tigers , but rather resembles a giraffe			0
astoundingly , she received a reply to her suggestion two weeks later from customer manager @entity94 who wrote : ‘ i think renaming tiger bread giraffe bread is a brilliant idea			0
‘ it looks much more like the blotches on a giraffe than the stripes on a tiger , does n’t it ? ’ the firm has now adopted the name permanently			0
@entity7 said : ' i love brown sauce , but i did n't know what the picture on the front of the bottle was			1
' i love eating eggs and bacon with brown sauce , so i thought i 'd draw a new version			0
' i 'm so excited that my picture is on bottles in lots of @entity4 shops			2
' confidence : his mother said the reply boosted @entity7 's confidence in his drawing skills and his own opinions @entity124 , @entity4 sauces buyer , said : ' when we heard @entity7 's offer and read his letter , we could n't resist			1
we love our customers to tell us what they think of products , and when they 're as creative as @entity7 , it 's a pleasure to be able to do something fun like this			0
' the drawing @entity7 created was perfect , and we 're so excited for our customers to pick up an original @entity7 print on a bottle of brown sauce			2
