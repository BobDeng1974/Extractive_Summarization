by @entity0 published : 12:05 est , 29 september 2013 updated : 12:14 est , 29 september 2013 the @entity2 mall massacre has sparked fears the atrocity was a warm - up for an attack on @entity7 , with @entity8 calling for ' permanent vigilance ' against terrorism in the @entity7			1
the prime minister said he has no intelligence of plans for an ' imminent ' attack in @entity7 but acknowledged that there was a ' worry ' that @entity7 - based @entity17 trained by the extremist @entity18 in the east @entity21 country might return to the @entity7 with the intention of committing a similar atrocity			1
he said that he had chaired meetings of the government 's @entity26 emergency contingency committee over the past week to discuss the implications of the westgate mall attack			0
concerns : prime minister @entity8 today admitted there was a ' worry ' that @entity7 - based @entity17 trained by extremist group @entity18 in @entity2 may return to the @entity7 with the intention of carrying out a similar attack to the @entity2 mall massacre mall massacre : a soldier carries a child to safety as armed police hunt the gunmen who went on a brutal shooting spree at @entity42 in @entity43 on september 21 at least 67 people , including six @entity7 , were killed after a group of militant gunmen launched an attack in the upmarket shopping centre in @entity43 on september 21			1
contingency plans have already been put in place in the period following the similar attacks in @entity54 , @entity55 , in 2008 , he said			2
mr @entity8 told @entity57 's @entity56 : ' we have been looking at this for a long time because of the appalling attack that happened in @entity54 in @entity55			2
' i have personally chaired a whole series of meetings years ago , but again actually this week , to check that we have got everything in place to prepare for those sorts of attacks			0
' we do n't have intelligence that something is about to happen , but it pays to be very , very prepared , very , very cautious , and to work out we have everything in place we can to deal with awful events like this			0
' plans : but @entity8 told @entity56 on his breakfast show , pictured , that contingency plans for such an attack were put in place following the @entity54 attacks in @entity55 in 2008 asked whether he was concerned that @entity7 - based @entity17 might export terror from the @entity21 state to the @entity7 , mr @entity8 said : ' there is always a worry of that and there is a hotbed of terrorism in @entity17 that spills over into other countries , and we are concerned about that and follow that			1
' what it shows i think is that we have to keep going against @entity94 extremism , whether that is people that are home - grown in our own country or whether it is extremism that is fomenting either on the @entity101 or in @entity102 or in @entity103 and @entity104			0
' it goes to this whole argument about why we need well - funded intelligence services , why we need to be engaged in the world , we need to share intelligence with others and why we have to be permanently vigilant			0
' i take these responsibilities incredibly seriously , i chair the @entity26 meetings myself and i make sure that everything from ambulance to fire to police , that everything is prepared			0
' we do n't have intelligence about anything imminent , but of course when that @entity54 attack happened and you see what happened in @entity2 , any responsible government would look at its own processes and procedures , and say how would we cope with something like that ? ' terrified : civilians take cover as gunmen roam the mall during the terrorist attack earlier this month saved : a woman drops from a ventilator shaft in the mall as plain clothed police rescue her			1
