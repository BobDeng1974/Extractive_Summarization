@entity0 was put on an @entity1 hit list after publishing a cartoon mocking the @entity4 it was late on a tuesday afternoon six years ago when the phone rang			1
a voice that had become familiar from @entity9 ’s @entity8 said two men planning to assassinate me had been arrested in @entity12			1
the @entity13 had foiled another planned attack on my paper @entity15 , which specifically targeted myself and the cartoonist @entity17			1
the terrorists turned out to be an @entity19 and a @entity20 , both of @entity23 origin			1
one was linked to atrocities the previous year in @entity25 ; he had already visited @entity9 twice on planning missions and had purchased his ticket back to @entity29			1
a year later , @entity17 was fortunate to escape the next attempt on his life			1
the 73 - year - old artist was watching a film with his young granddaughter when a @entity36 man with an axe broke in to his home to kill him			1
they dived into a safe room he had been forced to put in his house			1
his assailant was shot and captured by police			1
for a decade we have had to live in the shadow of such threats after i commissioned a dozen cartoons depicting the @entity4			1
this was a decision that provoked a storm around the world , with republication of the cartoons in scores of other papers			1
yet in spite of the assassination attempts , it was all too easy to be lulled into thinking the threat was abstract , as life continued			1
all that changed last week			2
people were killed in @entity66 because of cartoons mocking @entity68			1
our worst nightmare has come true			2
these murders challenge democracies in the most sickening style			2
they present a terrible threat to the free speech that is the foundation of true democracy			2
but the tragic events also expose our own hypocrisies , the delusions and evasion we take to keep peace in the short term , along with the destructive culture of grievance that politicians have been eager to exploit			2
i knew two of the killed cartoonists at @entity90			1
i had appeared on a panel about threats to free speech with @entity94 ( aka @entity95 ) and worked on a comic project with @entity97			2
i liked them a lot			2
they were funny and easy - going			1
i also appeared as a witness in a 2007 court case after two @entity105 organisations in @entity106 accused @entity90 of inciting religious hatred by publishing cartoons of the @entity4			1
among them was the one by @entity17 that became the most infamous of our cartoons – a simple image of the @entity4 with a bomb tucked in his turban			1
yet i stumbled almost accidentally into sparking what came to be known as the cartoon crisis , leading to riots , protests and dozens of deaths around the world			2
liberté : a cartoonist uses the famous 1830 @entity126 painting of the figure @entity128 leading the people to revolution with the modern introduction of jihadis i had taken a post as cultural editor of my paper after years on the road as a foreign correspondent			1
among my postings was @entity139 , where i was struck by dissidents who stood apart from @entity142 society on the strength of their belief in freedom			2
the crisis began innocently enough			2
a children ’s writer could not find an illustrator for a book about the @entity4			2
several illustrators declined to do it due to fear ; then the one who agreed insisted on anonymity			2
we observed several more examples of self - censorship or calls for censorship when it came to the treatment of @entity68 in the public domain			1
theatres , comedians , translators and museums were censoring themselves			2
my point was not to provoke or mock anyone , but simply to start a debate about self - censorship in our treatment of @entity68 compared with other religions			1
by proposing a practical demonstration – @entity173 , a time - honoured journalistic principle – we wanted to let readers form their own opinion			1
as we soon found out , fears of violence for ridiculing a religious symbol were far from fantasy			2
i could never have imagined being condemned as a racist and finding myself on an @entity1 hit list			1
i was constantly asked to apologise for subsequent events , finding myself blamed for the lethal over-reaction of others			2
following the @entity106 tragedy , i have been asked again and again my reaction			2
and the harsh truth is that mass murder in @entity66 has exposed hypocrisy , even as all those good people declare ‘ @entity192 ’			1
i find it strange that people who welcome diversity when it comes to culture , religion and ethnicity fail to welcome the same diversity when it comes to expressing ourselves			0
these people are basically saying that the more multicultural society becomes , the less freedom of expression we need			0
this seems a twisted stance			0
it should be the other way round – the more different we are , it seems to me , the more we need an open and free exchange of opinions			0
unfortunately , governments defend restrictions on free speech on the grounds of keeping the peace and avoiding clashes between different groups			0
so they ban hate speech and blasphemy			0
in 2004 , @entity223 was killed in @entity224 after making a controversial film about @entity68 culture			0
the @entity228 minister of justice responded by saying his life could have been saved if @entity230 had tougher laws on hate speech			0
the harsh truth is that the mass murder in @entity66 has exposed hypocrisy , even as all those good people declare ‘ @entity192 ’ but it is not only governments that advocate this blinkered approach			1
the human rights industry also defends limitations on speech , referring to the protection of human dignity and vulnerable identities			0
i was once asked to join a panel discussion organised by @entity246 and the @entity247 under the banner victims of @entity249			0
i suggested there were only victims of crime in a society based on the rule of law and the idea that people exerting long - held statutory rights were ‘ victims ’ was nonsense			1
there was anger at my comments			0
@entity17 ’s cartoon of the @entity4 has been criticised for being racist or stigmatising @entity68			0
he depicted @entity4 as representative of @entity68 in the same way images of @entity267 refer to @entity268 , @entity269 to @entity270 , and @entity271 to the @entity19			0
portraying @entity269 with blood on his hands , the crucified @entity267 holding a beer , or the @entity274 armed with a bomb does not mean you think that all marxists are bloodthirsty murderers or that @entity281 are drunkards or terrorists			0
@entity17 ’s cartoon attacks a hardline religious doctrine , not a particular group within society			0
i would make a similar point about cartoons lampooning the @entity4 in @entity90			1
@entity289 , former editor - in - chief of @entity90 , was once asked if they had n’t crossed a line with cartoons mocking the @entity4			1
‘ what kind of civilisation are we if we can not ridicule those who bomb trains and airplanes and commit mass murder against innocent civilians ? ’ he responded			0
yes indeed , what kind of civilisation are we ? this is the key question for the coming days , weeks and months of hot debate			0
do we want to live in a tyranny of silence – or do we defend the right to offend ? these cartoons can be offensive to some ; they are designed to stir debate			1
but labelling such images racist – an opinion aired in the @entity19 and @entity314 – is misleading and dangerous			0
if you characterise race and religion as similar , you risk supporting those sinister forces who claim that apostasy is impossible and abandonment of religion a capital offence			0
' these murders challenge democracies in the most sickening style			0
they present a terrible threat to the free speech that is the foundation of true democracy ' : above , tributes to victims of the @entity66 terror attacks many muslims believe they are born into their faith and it would be a serious crime to quit @entity68			1
they treat religion as if it is a race			0
we should not accept that logic			0
identity is a key issue in the modern world			0
it is no longer easy to answer questions such as : who am i ? who are we as a community ? how do we protect our identity ? but identity politics has become a growing challenge to free speech			0
we seem more concerned with protecting the sensibilities of groups rather than defending the historic democratic rights that we are entitled to as human beings			0
the killers in @entity66 sincerely believed that human beings at @entity90 deserved to die because of their offensive cartoons			1
they felt this was justified by their militant interpretation of @entity68			0
but the killings were also taking place within a grievance culture that incites people to take offence every time somebody says something they do not like			0
the assumption is that there is n’t any real difference between words and deeds , between a verbal insult and physical violence			0
yet i believe those who support this point of view are playing into the hands of both islamists and the growing swathe of xenophobic political parties across @entity386			0
instead of sending people to sensitivity training when they say something offensive , perhaps we should all be sent to insensitivity training			0
we need to grow thicker skins if freedom of speech is to survive in a multicultural world .			0
