the @entity0 are famous for flying the world 's first successful airplane in 1903 - yet they may have been beaten to the record two years earlier , according to a prestigious aviation journal			1
@entity5 claims in its 100th anniversary edition that @entity9 aviation pioneer @entity7 was actually the first man to successfully build and fly his ' @entity11 ' plane in august 1901			1
and according to reports , @entity7 - who emigrated to @entity12 and changed his name to @entity7 - may have also been the first person to invent the flying car			1
@entity7 next to his @entity17 aircraft			0
this photo was taken in 1901 , the year @entity7 is said to have flown his ' flying car ' model for a mile and a half at 50 feet above the ground history rewritten : @entity24 and @entity0 face being written out of history now that the @entity7 story has been given credability the journal claims that after studying evidence put forward by aviation expert @entity30 in support of @entity7 : ' [ @entity7 's flight ] , it must be stressed , was more than two years before the @entity33 manhandled their flyer from its shed and flew a couple of hundred feet in a straight line			1
' thanks to the meticulous researches of @entity30 — to whose website www.gustave-whitehead.com we earnestly recommend readers seeking greater detail — an injustice is rectified with only slight bruising to @entity24 and @entity45 's reputation			0
' the @entity33 were right ; but @entity7 was ahead			0
' although reports have both supported , and denied @entity7 's achievement since 1901 , the claims in @entity48 's journal is the first time it has been officially recognised by such a widely - respected aviation body			1
@entity7 designed an aircraft in the early 1900s that could be driven like a car , but was fitted with wings that could be unfolded , turning the car into a plane			1
@entity7 then built his condor aircraft , also known as @entity17 , based on this flying car model			1
the aircraft had two engines ; a 20 horsepower engine used to fly the vehicle , and a 10 horsepower engine used for driving			0
the idea was that the pilot could switch between engines depending on whether they wanted to drive or fly the vehicle			0
@entity11 was also fitted with two propellers that were controlled and powered when the plane engine was selected			2
reports in the @entity75 in august 1901 claim @entity7 drove the @entity11 to a a field outside @entity77 in the @entity12 , unfolded the wings and made two demonstration flights			1
during the second flight , @entity7 is said to have flown for a mile and a half and reached a height of 50 feet			1
further reports claim he updated the model , called @entity85 , and made another demonstration flight on 22 january 1902 in front of 17 witnesses			0
@entity7 emigrated to the @entity89 from @entity90 in the 1890s			0
he designed a ' roadable aircraft ' that was small enough to fit in a garage like a car			0
@entity7 envisaged owners being able to drive the car to a field , or suitable runway and then unfold wings on the side of the vehicle that would then turn the car into a plane			1
he then built his condor aircraft , also known as @entity17 , based on this flying car model			1
the aircraft was fitted with two engines ; a 20 horsepower engine used to fly the vehicle , and a 10 horsepower engine used for driving			0
the pilot could then switch between which engine they wanted to use , and when the flying engine was turned on it would help power the craft 's twin propellers			0
a report in the @entity75 on 18 august 1901 details eyewitness accounts of @entity7 's flight , which took place in @entity77 four days earlier			1
the journalist confirms that the flight took off from @entity122 , flew for about a mile and a half , made two turns and then landed safely @entity7 emigrated to the @entity12 from @entity90 in the 1890s			2
he was originally called @entity7 but changed his name when he settled in @entity77 reports in the @entity75 in august 1901 claim @entity7 drove the @entity11 to a a field outside @entity77 in the the @entity12 , unfolded the wings and made two demonstration flights			1
the journalist who wrote the story is said to have witnessed the flight himself			0
during the second flight , @entity7 is said to have flown for a mile and a half and reached a height of 50 feet			2
further reports claim he updated the model , called @entity85 , and made another demonstration flight on 22 january 1902 in front of 17 witnesses			0
if these reports are true , it means @entity7 beat the @entity0 to the record			2
@entity0 designed and flew their flyer plane in december 1903			2
five people were said to have witnessed the flight including @entity148 who took photographic evidence			0
claims that @entity7 beat the @entity0 to the record first emerged in 1937			2
@entity0 is said to have called the story a hoax and chief aviation historian at the @entity155 , @entity156 , rejects the claims			2
writing in a blog for the @entity158 , @entity156 said that @entity7 contradicted himself when giving evidence of his flight : ' over the next decade , as aviators in @entity12 and @entity162 took to the sky following the pattern established by the @entity0 , @entity7 would continue to built aircraft for other enthusiasts			1
not one of those powered machines ever left the ground			0
' @entity156 then concluded : ' @entity170 had somehow forgotten the secrets of flight , or he had never flown a powered machine at all			0

@entity7 is *believed* to have flown his @entity11 plane in august 1901 - more than two years before the @entity0 ' *infamous* flight
@entity11 was designed to be part - car , part - plane and may have been the first flying car , according to the prestigious aviation journal @entity182
