by @entity0 published : 08:49 est , 12 january 2014 updated : 03:48 est , 13 january 2014 @entity2 : @entity3 , pictured on the @entity4 , said the attitudes it embraces are ' more damaging ' today for his latest @entity8 role he has become an icon of hedonism , recklessness and the worst excesses of the banking industry			1
but according to @entity3 , even the profanity - laden , ultra-expensive life of stockbroker @entity15 , whom he plays in @entity17 of @entity18 , does not match up to the ' destructive ' heights of today 's @entity20			1
the actor said that as the economy has grown , the culture of unbounded greed shown in the film , directed by @entity25 , has becoming ' more and more damaging in our culture '			1
speaking to the @entity30 's @entity4 show , he said the culture of @entity20 as shown in the film , which is set mostly in the boom years of the 1990s , was ' incredibly destructive			1
' he then added : ' i think this attitude is more and more damaging in our culture today			2
as our economy continues to expand , the population continues to surge - this has to do with the evolution of our species in a lot of ways			0
' and though the actor admitted that the excesses of the film - which shows bankers using prostitutes at work , taking hard drugs and even organising a midget - throwing competition - were distasteful , he insisted the ' cautionary tale ' was simply being true to life			2
he said : ' people have been talking about a protagonist getting his proper punishment at the end of a film			0
our film does n’t have that because it ’s the truth			0
' responding to some critics , who have complained that the film ignores the suffering of investors who lost millions to line bankers ' pockets , he said that when making the film a conscious decision had been made to show only the people living the high life			2
banking excess : @entity3 , who plays @entity73 in the film , founds a corrupt stock - brokerage high life : @entity3 's character is pictured on his yacht , where he meets @entity80 investigators @entity81 : the film features @entity3 's character having sex on top of a pile of money he explained : ' we very purposefully did n’t do that [ include the victims ]			1
to me , the best thing a film can do is immerse an audience completely in somebody else ’s mindset			0
these people were n’t thinking about their victims – they were ships moving forward that did n’t think about the wake of their destruction			0
they cared only about themselves			0
