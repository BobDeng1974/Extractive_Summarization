@entity0 tonight set out the first of his ' red lines ' for a second coalition , warning he will block any cut in education spending			1
the @entity0 admitted today that their best hope is to end up with 30 - something mps after may 7 , compared with the 57 elected in 2010			1
a senior party source said their best chance of holding the balance of power after the @entity13 was to finish ' in the 30s ' if they are able to retain a number of closely - fought seats			0
@entity0 leader @entity0 , making play dough at @entity19 , @entity20 in @entity21 , said he would demand education spending be protected from cuts as the price of propping up another coalition mr @entity0 said the first of what he dubbed his ' @entity29 policies ' is a £ 5billion commitment to protect the entire education budget in real terms			1
but mr @entity0 is still determined to form a coalition with either the @entity34 or @entity35 and today vowed to set out which of the policies announced in his manifesto would be non-negotiable			2
the first of what he dubbed his ' @entity29 policies ' , which the party would insist upon as a condition of propping up a government , is a £ 5billion commitment to protect the entire education budget in real terms			1
it would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards and at all stages ' from cradle to college ' , which goes further than the @entity50 or @entity35 have promised			1
mr @entity0 said : ' i can confirm a @entity0 red line – a pre-condition for @entity54 – is increasing spending on education			1
' the @entity0 will not allow our children and grandchildren to pay the price of this generation 's mistakes			2
we believe above all else in spreading opportunity , in tearing down the barriers that stop people from reaching their potential			0
nothing is more crucial to that than education			0
' the @entity0 leader - who claimed just last week that he would not set out ' red lines ' - said people felt ' confused ' about the outcome of the election and he wanted to be ' clear and certain ' about his party 's intentions			2
the pledge would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards and at all stages ' from cradle to college ' , which goes further than the @entity50 or @entity35 have promised the @entity0 admitted today that their best hope is to end up with 30 - something mps after may 7 , compared with the 57 elected in 2010 inviting criticism that the rest of his policies are all negotiable , he said he would fight for everything in the manifesto but that ' here are some @entity29 policies and others which do n't assume quite the same significance '			1
' i will confirm the non-negotiables , the deal breakers , the things without which we would not enter into a coalition government and i 'll do so fairly rapidly over the next few days ' , he said			0
mr @entity0 's policy is £ 5billion more expensive that what the @entity34 had planned – which is a freeze on schools spending for those aged 5 to 16 and cuts in other areas			2
it is £ 2.5bn more than @entity35 planned to spend on protecting the entire education budget but not accounting for an expected 460,000 rise in pupil numbers over the next five years			0
' the next government must increase spending on nurseries , schools and colleges			0
that means education spending must rise with both prices and pupil numbers ' , he said			0
' without investment in education , there can be no deal with the @entity0			0
' the pledge would take education funding from £ 49bn a year currently to more than £ 55 by the end of the next @entity129 , to be funded by rising economic growth once the deficit is cleared			0
a promise on education spending is intended to win over floating voters in key seats where the @entity0 are facing the @entity50 , to capitalise on concerns about cuts to public services			1
a senior lib dem involved in party strategy said the campaign 's focus was increasingly on 10 to 15 marginal seats			0
mr @entity0 would not comment on numbers of seats and simply said his party would do better than dire opinion polls suggest .			1

@entity0 names the first of his ' @entity29 policies ' as price of support
would mean raising spending on education every year from 2018 onwards
@entity0 say it covers every stage of education ' from cradle to college '
but *insiders* admit the party could lose as many as 20 seats on may 7
