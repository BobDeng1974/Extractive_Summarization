then in february 2010 we lost a true icon in the form of avant - garde and quintessentially quirky @entity29 designer @entity2			1
years before , in 1992 , @entity1 famously bought @entity2 's entire graduate collection for £ 5,000 , and went on to become a close friend and ardent supporter of his work and career			1

the gown , which is expected to fetch between £ 25,000 - 35,000 , features acid green beads and a broad dark brown horse hair fringe at the hem			1
@entity1 insisted that the dress be made strapless for her , which albeit flattering , made it rather impractical to wear as the weight of the beads produces a strong gravitational pull and she later gave the dress to her assistant			1
firm fan : blow famously bought @entity2 's entire graduate collection for £ 5,000 , and went on to become a close friend and ardent supporter of his work and career this exquisite and important @entity2 gown is a rarity ( the bulk of her wardrobe having been acquired after her death by her close friend @entity91 )			1

@entity1 started her 30 year career auspiciously as an assistant to @entity103 at @entity104			0
even then , she steered clear of the conventional			0
at @entity1 's memorial service , @entity103 said that when @entity1 worked for @entity104 she did everything fabulously , even cleaning @entity103 's desk with @entity110 water and @entity112 perfume			0
in the @entity113 , @entity1 was fashion director of @entity114 , after which she moved to @entity116 , again as fashion director			2
she discovered models @entity118 and @entity120 , and worked with major photographers like @entity122 and @entity123			0
she revelled in shocking people with daring outfits : she once wore a fish - smelling , crystal - encrusted lobster on her head to a fashion show , and @entity130 has been cited as a modern - day @entity1			1
but she began to suffer from depression , and in 2007 , diagnosed with bipolar disorder and ovarian cancer , @entity1 committed suicide aged 48			2
@entity2 received press attention after her suicide with rumours circulating that there was a rift between the pair at the time of her death , focusing on @entity2 's under - appreciation of @entity1			1
in response to these rumours , @entity2 told @entity147 : ' it 's so much b * * * * * *			0

' they do n't know me			0
they do n't know my relationship with @entity1			0
it 's complete b * * * * * * *			0
people can talk ; you can ask her sisters ... that part of the industry , they should stay away from my life , or mine and @entity1 's life			2
' what i had with @entity1 was completely dissociated from fashion , beyond fashion			2
' from humble @entity168 - end beginnings , @entity2 catapulted through life from the 21st floor of a council flat as an obstinate 16 - year old embroider ( one who stitched the phrase ‘ i am a c * * * ’ on a jacket designed for @entity177 ) to an inexorable household name			2
describing his childhood as ‘ troubled ’ , @entity2 came out as gay at the age of 18 armed with a reputable foul mouth and offensive humor , often incorporating themes such as death , masochism and violence into his fantastically original collections			0
