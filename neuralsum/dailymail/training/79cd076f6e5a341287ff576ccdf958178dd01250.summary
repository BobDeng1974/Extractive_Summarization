by @entity0 last updated at 11:00 pm on 23rd november 2011 if @entity4 ' @entity3 ' @entity2 opts to have something other than turkey this @entity6 , she may be forgiven			1
that 's because the competitive eater has just broken another record - after scoffing 5lbs worth of the bird 's meat in just ten minutes			2
the 5ft 5in 105lb woman claimed the record as part of the @entity15 , held in @entity16 , @entity17 , yesterday			2
champion ! @entity4 ' @entity3 ' @entity2 shows off her trophy after eating 5lbs of turkey meat in ten minutes to add another competitive food eating record to her collection no cutlery required : @entity2 and her rival @entity24 , left , tuck into the turkey while showing off their different ways of tackling the challenge @entity2 's victory was made more remarkable as she crushed her nearest rivals - all men - by more than a pound of meat			1
her feat saw her collect a cash prize of $ 1,581 and adding another title to her collection of world records			1
speaking after her victory , the 42 - year - old told the @entity43 : ' i left only bone			2
' ' i ’m not normally a fan of turkey ... but their turkey today was very tasty , moist and warm			0
that ’s why i ate most of the meat			2
' @entity2 , who is from @entity52 , @entity53 , and works as a restaurant manager , used a less frenzied technique to eat the bird during the contest			1
even though @entity2 weighs just 105 lbs , she owns a slew of eating records in the zone : @entity4 concentrates while scoffing another chicken wing - one of 183 she managed in 12 minutes - to break her own record in september while no competitor uses cutlery , @entity2 stripped handfuls of meat from the bird and placed the pieces in her mouth while drinking water in between			1
asparagus - 5.75lbs deep fried in 10 minutes burgers - 7 3/4 pounders in 10 minutes cheesecakes - 11lbs in 9 minutes			0
chicken nuggets - 80 in 5 minutes chicken wings - 183 in 12 minutes crabcakes - 46 3oz cakes in 10 minutes @entity77 - 65 hard boiled in 6 minutes , 40 seconds fruitcakes - 4lbs , 14oz in 10 minutes @entity79 - 206 n 10 minutes jambalaya - 9lbs of crayfish variety in 10 mins lobster - 11.3lbs of meat in 12 minutes moonpies - 38 in 8 minutes oysters - 46 dozen in 10 minutes pizza - 6 extra large pizza slices in 15 minutes pulled pork - 23 sandwiches in 10 minutes tacos - 43 soft tacos in 11 minutes tater tots - 250 tater tots in 5 minutes @entity2 's technique differed vastly from @entity24 , who claimed second prize in the contest			1
the 400 - pound man , nicknamed ' @entity96 ' , picked up the bird in one hand and gnawed away using a technique more suited to a chicken leg			2
@entity24 said of his strategy : ' i just ripped the bird apart and ate the innards			0
' i think i ate the wishbone by accident			0
' @entity24 , who holds his own world record for eating pumpkin pies , praised his fellow competitor			0
he added : ' i ’m definitely in awe of her abilities , to be so small and eat so much			0
' @entity2 's success in @entity17 follows several other world records			1
in september she managed to eat 183 chicken wings in just 12 minutes , breaking her own record			0
and in july she became the first @entity118 by swallowing 40 hot dogs in 10 minutes			0
she also has records for eating in several other categories including cheesecakes , crayfish , oysters and jalapenos			0
and for anyone wondering what @entity4 is having this thursday - she is planning a feast with @entity130 food .			1

@entity4 ' @entity3 ' @entity2 collects $ 1,581 first prize
beats nearest rival by more than a pound of meat
