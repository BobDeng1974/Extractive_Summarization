he had even taken to @entity15 to boast : ' @entity16 by picking up lamb chops from @entity18 - i 'm cooking dinner for my mum tonight			2
' says one thing : prime minister @entity3 seen in a photo opportunity arranged with the @entity24 visiting family butchers , @entity26 , in @entity13 , @entity14 , to mark ' @entity7 ' but once the photographers had departed , so too apparently did his shop - local principles			1

minutes later , he was pictured with a barista after popping into @entity41 for a cup of coffee			1
the chain has more than 600 coffee shops in the @entity6 , @entity46 and the @entity47			2
mr @entity3 's visits to the chain stores appear to fly in the face of the @entity7 initiative , which is designed to encourage people to use local shops and businesses rather than the chain stores increasingly dominating @entity6 's high streets			1
