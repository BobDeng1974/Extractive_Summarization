@entity1 's hometown is divided over proposals to name a new bypass after the former prime minister			1
the people of @entity6 , @entity7 , are eagerly awaiting a new relief road and supporters are clamouring for it to be named in her honour			1
there is no permanent memorial to of @entity15 's first female prime minister , who died in 2013 , in the town , except for a small plaque commemorating her birthplace			1
proposals to name a bypass in @entity1 's hometown in her honour has divided the town			2
pictured , the former prime minister at the @entity25 conference in 1989 @entity15 's first female prime minister @entity1 visits her alma mater , @entity26 , in @entity6 in 1986 so @entity27 , a @entity25 councillor for @entity28 , was eager to remedy that and registered the names @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 for the bypass			1
he said he proposed the idea in a bid to provide a fitting memorial to the town 's most famous export - but he admits the town is divided over the issue			2
councillor @entity27 thinks naming the bypass after @entity33 would be a fitting tribute councillor @entity27 added a previous proposal to build a statue in @entity33 's honour several years ago had sparked the same controversy			1
he told @entity49 : ' it 's certainly caused a stir			0
' it was the same thing with the statue four or five years ago			0
' i raised the idea of a statue and a tourist trail and the response was " we should n't commemorate her life and there are far more important people than @entity1 "			0
' but we need to really celebrate her life and her career			0
' @entity1 certainly changed the world in which we live in today			0
' she really put the great back in @entity15			2
' he added : ' i have received people from @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 and @entity73 who all wanted to visit @entity6 and could n't understand why there is n't anything to commemorate @entity1			0
' some months ago , i made enquiries as to whether anybody had registered names for the bypass - which was no. ' so i stuck my head above the parapet and registered @entity31 , @entity33 and @entity32			0
' but @entity84 politicians in the town are strongly against the idea , claiming it would be wrong to name the bypass after such a controversial person			0
councillor @entity27 's idea of a @entity1 tourist trail also sparked controversy			1
pictured , her birthplace - a corner shop in @entity95 , @entity6 the only memorial to @entity15 's first female prime minister in her hometown is a small plaque on the corner shop where she lived			1

only memorial in her hometown of @entity6 , @entity7 , is small plaque
so @entity25 councillor @entity27 proposed @entity108 as a name for the new relief road
he says it would be a fitting tribute to @entity15 's first female prime minister
but he admits his proposal has sparked controversy in the town
