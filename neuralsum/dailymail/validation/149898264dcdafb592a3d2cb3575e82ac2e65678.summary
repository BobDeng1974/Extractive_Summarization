@entity1 's mayor unveiled the city 's controversial @entity3 golf course on wednesday and laid out an ardent defence of a project that has been criticised by environmental activists and is at the centre of legal wranglings			1
the course , part of which has been carved out of a nature reserve , had been kept strictly under wraps during a construction phase that is nearly complete after more than a year 's work			1
gently rolling hills covered with lush grass that looked like it would be at home in @entity21 surrounded small islands of native plants			2
sprinklers were hard at work under a harsh midday sun during the visit by news media			0
the new @entity1 course for the @entity30 was unveiled on wednesday @entity1 mayor @entity31 ( second right ) walks the almost complete @entity3 golf course a worker cuts the grass on the course that until now has been kept largely under wraps prosecutors have repeatedly requested for work on the course to be halted over alleged irregularities in environmental impact studies the bucolic setting has been embroiled in a controversy stretching back years that has overshadowed what was meant to mark golf 's triumphant return to the @entity48 after a 112 - year absence			1
prosecutors have repeatedly requested for work on the course to be halted over alleged irregularities in environmental impact studies , though a judge rejected the latest demand late tuesday night			2
in a separate case , another prosecutor is weighing up whether to bring charges against mayor @entity31 for allegedly granting concessions to developers			2
still other questions persist about the ownership of the land			0
@entity31 dismissed the allegations , insisting in an agitated , two - hour - long presentation that the course has been built in strict accordance with the law			2
' it 's hogwash , it 's a lie ... it 's a fallacy , ' @entity31 said , as he delivered a barrage of facts , figures , photos and images of documents about the golf course			1
' lies can not prevail			0
' he pledged total transparency , with @entity82 in the midst of an investigation into a massive corruption scheme at the state - run oil giant , @entity86 , which has rocked the country with near - daily revelations			0
' @entity91 and i personally are very conscious that we are going to have to explain and re-explain ( things ) and prove ourselves more than we would have to if we were staging the @entity48 , for example , ' he said			0
protesters stand outside the @entity3 course that is at the center of complicated legal wranglings activists protest against the construction of the course that was carved partly out of a nature reserve @entity31 also insisted that while some land from the nature reserve was bulldozed to make way for the course 's grassy knolls , because the lion 's share of the terrain used to be a sand quarry , the course has actually increased the amount of native plant life in the area			1
' does this look like an environmental crime ? ' he exclaimed , arms akimbo , as he led reporters over the course 's spongy grass			1
earlier , @entity31 projected aerial photos from the 1980s apparently showing what 's now the golf course dotted with concrete structures			1
environmentalists contend that hardy subtropical vegetation had since retaken the area and that before the bulldozers descended it had become home to several endangered species , including species of butterflies and frogs			0
' he ( @entity31 ) thinks that all green 's the same , ' said @entity135 , a member of the @entity136 ( @entity137 ) group that has been protesting outside the site for months			1
' but non-native grass is just not the same thing as the native ecosystem			0
' @entity135 , who was among a small group of protesters on wednesday , insisted it was unnecessary to build a new course in the first place , since @entity91 already has two other golf courses - despite golf 's status in @entity82 as an unpopular sport played almost exclusively by the moneyed elite			1
the owner of one of the courses has said he wrote to authorities to offer it up for the @entity48 but never heard back			0
@entity91 mayor @entity31 insists the course is in strict accordance with the law protesters say @entity31 spearheaded the course 's construction in order to favor a campaign donor , a developer who is building luxury residential towers alongside the course protester props associate ' wildlife crimes ' with the counstruction and call @entity31 a ' climate terrorist ' @entity135 said that donations made to @entity31 ' political campaign by a wealthy and powerful developer who 's building luxury residential towers on the margins of the golf course were the real motor behind the construction of the course			1
the exclusive marble - and - glass units are being pre-sold even before construction is completed for several million dollars a piece			0
asked whether he had received a campaign donation from the developer , @entity186 , @entity31 said he did n't know and that in any case ' it would n't have been illegal			0
' he added that one of the existing courses was deemed too small , while modifications to the other would have cost nearly as much as building the new course			2
@entity31 also brushed aside questions over the ownership of the land , contending that much of the wealthy western suburb of @entity198 , where the course is located , is beset by long - running conflicts over land ownership			1
attorney @entity202 , a former member of @entity82 's @entity203 , dismissed @entity31 ' explanations , saying it made no sense to press ahead with construction of the course on such legally complicated land			2
' even if they had to build a new course , they could have picked any other terrain - one not in a protected nature reserve - or also one where the ownership is clear , ' @entity213 said			0
' the whole thing is just a pretext for land speculation			0
