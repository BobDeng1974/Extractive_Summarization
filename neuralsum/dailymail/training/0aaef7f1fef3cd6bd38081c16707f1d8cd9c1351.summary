@entity8 , 67 , died at home after a short battle with tonsil cancer , but medics failed to turn off his @entity13 ( @entity13 ) for several hours			1
the ' heart - zapper ' implant delivers life - saving electric shocks if it detects an irregular heart rate - but can cause painful jolts when left active in dying patients			1
@entity8 ( with wife @entity19 ) continued receiving painful electric shocks to his heart for several hours from a ' zapper ' implant that medics did n't know how to switch off an out - of - hours @entity24 came to mr @entity8 ' house in @entity26 , @entity27 , after he had discharged himself from @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity30 - but did n't know how to deactivate the device			1
the implant had been installed at @entity32 but bosses admitted they could n't provide the doctor with clear information on how to de-activate it			0
the trust has its own guidelines for switching off @entity39 on patients in hospital but they do not apply for patients who choose to die at home or in a hospice under the @entity45			1
switching off the device involves holding a specialist magnet over the @entity13 , which temporarily closes a magnetic switch incorporated in it			1
to turn it off permanently , the device has to then be reprogrammed remotely using a ' wand ' attached to a computer			2
the @entity51 published official guidelines in 2009 recommending that health professionals have a ' responsibility ' to ensure any implanted device is de-activated in patients close to the point of death			2
mr @entity8 , 67 , died at home after a short battle with tonsil cancer , but medics failed to turn off his @entity13 ( @entity13 ) for several hours , says his widow mr @entity8 ' widow @entity19 , 65 , held talks with hospital chiefs following her husband 's death in june 2011 and was told that new guidelines were being put in place to prevent such an incident happening again			1
but two years on , the guidelines have yet to be implemented by the @entity27 and @entity73 , which is responsible for integrating cardiac care between hospitals , gps and other health organisations in the region			0
health bosses have admitted that ' more training and education ' was needed and that re-organisation of the @entity83 had slowed down the introduction of official guidelines			0
mrs @entity86 says she has now complained after becoming frustrated that ' no lessons have been learned ' from her husband 's death two years ago			0
two years on , mrs @entity86 is angry that guidelines put in place to prevent such an incident happening again have not been implemented she said : ' my main concern after his death was to make sure this would n't happen to other patients and i was satisfied at the time because i felt my concerns would help shape this new policy			2
but there seems to have been next to no movement on the issue and now i feel like i was just being kept quiet			0
' from my experience these guidelines are badly needed and it shocks me that it 's taken so long			0
' because my husband was unconscious , i ca n't know if he was experiencing pain - i 'll never know - but it 's not something that should be allowed to happen			0
' it was his choice and his right to die at home , but after making that decision we were not given the support we needed to make sure he was allowed a peaceful passing			2
' a @entity32 spokesman said : ' " our @entity13 specialist nurse discussed deactivation of the @entity13 with the hospice			2
mr @entity8 was sent home before this happened , and then deteriorated			1
' a physician attended his home and contacted the hospital , but could not get the clearest of information [ from the hospital ] about magnet application to deactivate the @entity13 as this took place out of hours			1
' the new guidelines from the network will give clearer details for physicians about magnet application , and where to get these magnets if necessary			0
the intention is that the @entity39 are switched off before the patient gets to this stage			0
' a spokeswoman for the @entity27 and @entity73 said : ' the network has been working on an implementation plan and the intention is to launch the policy over the coming months and work with clinicians to agree how they will take it forward			0

@entity8 , 67 , died at home after a short battle with tonsil cancer
also had an @entity13 to regulate *heartbeat*
these can cause painful jolts when left active in dying patients
medics who came to mr @entity8 ' home did not know how to deactivate device
